Furthermore, in a preliminary study, we have shown that while nasal challenge with TNF\u03b1 fails to produce acute effects, it produces late-phase plasma exudation (i.e., extravasation and luminal entry of plasma) [16], a response characteristic of on-going inflammation [17]. We have also observed that this response may be associated with increased nasal mucosal output of granulocyte mediators [16]. While our observations suggest a role for TNF\u03b1 in upper airway conditions characterised by inflammation, information on the nature of this response is scarce. Further information in this field is warranted for several reasons: it may be used to determine whether or not anti-TNF measures should be evaluated for upper respiratory tract conditions. Furthermore, studies in allergic rhinitis may elucidate specific roles for TNF\u03b1 in type-1 allergic inflammation, which may not be done in allergic asthma where type-1 features may be blurred by chronic inflammatory features.",

Exclusion criteria were: history of respiratory tract infection within seven days of the start of the study, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, other nasal disease (structural abnormalities, rhinosinusitis, and polyposis), use of decongestants within seven days of the start of the study, and use of other treatments (except occasional analgesics) within one month of the start of the study.

Accordingly, eleven of the allergic subjects were skin-prick positive for both birch and timothy grass allergen, whereas one was sensitized to birch alone and one to timothy grass alone. None of the individuals had positive tests for house dust mite. Eight subjects had positive skin-prick tests for either cat or dog dander, but none of them were exposed to these animals on a regular basis.",

In the present study, the plasma exudation producing effect of TNF\u03b1 (10 \u03bcg) at this time-point was confirmed. Taken together, our observations suggest that TNF\u03b1 may not per se produce acute plasma exudation in human nasal airways (like, e.g., histamine would), but can induce an inflammatory condition that is characterised by \"late-phase\" plasma exudation. Plasma exudation is a specific feature of inflammation and increased levels of plasma proteins in airway mucosal surface liquids characterize allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory tract infections [19,20]. Accordingly, and supported by observations on increased levels of TNF\u03b1 in allergic rhinitis [13,14] as well as common cold [21,22], TNF\u03b1 may be a pro-inflammatory factor in inflammatory conditions of the nasal airway.",

Moreover, in the present study, nasal biopsy numbers of neutrophils, in the study group as a whole, were significantly increased post TNF\u03b1 challenge further indicating a neutrophil-active effect of this cytokine. Our finding is in agreement with observations by Thomas et al. [9,10], who reported sputum neutrophilia in healthy subjects as well as in patients with mild asthma following TNF\u03b1 inhalation. Also in agreement, observations in vitro have identified TNF\u03b1 as a factor that attracts [23] and, potentially, activates [24] neutrophil granulocytes.

We have no specific explanation for the discrepant findings, but a variable eosinophil activity at baseline may be one option: Thomas et al. observed that inhalation of TNF\u03b1 to mild asthmatics increased eosinophil infiltration [9] whereas this was not the case in healthy subjects [10]. In the present study, the biopsy analysis, which provides an additional aspect of cellular activity, showed that TNF\u03b1 did not produce recruitment of eosinophils. Accordingly, our overall conclusion is that TNF\u03b1 administered to patients with allergic rhinitis out of season, when there may be some degree of nasal eosinophilia but not at all as marked as during season allergen exposure, does not produce any marked pro-eosinophil effects. Further studies are warranted to examine effects of TNF\u03b1 on eosinophil activities, tentatively involving patients with on-going allergic rhinitis.",

The only difference in TNF\u03b1 induced effects between the groups was that the nasal mucosal numbers of neutrophils were increased in healthy subjects following TNF\u03b1 challenge but not in patients with allergic rhinitis. However, TNF\u03b1 did produce a numerical increase in neutrophils also in allergic rhinitis, which did not reach statistical significance (possibly due to a somewhat higher baseline). Furthermore, MPO, as marker of neutrophil activity, was significantly increased in both study groups. Taken together, no marked differences emerged between healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis regarding TNF\u03b1-induced effects. However, further studies may be warranted in order to elucidate whether TNF\u03b1 has a specific role in allergic airway conditions: such studies are warranted based on observations that patients with allergic rhinitis feature increased tissue expression of TNF\u03b1 mRNA and TNF\u03b1 protein [13-15]. Moreover, a basis for further exploration may be the recent observation that mice sensitized to ovalbumin and subjected to gene therapy (soluble TNF\u03b1 receptor IgGFc fusion gene) present decreased symptoms and attenuated aggregation of mast cells, eosinophils, and IL-5 positive cells following nasal ovalbumin challenge [25]. Tentatively, further human in vivo studies may involve intervention with anti-TNF\u03b1 measures in allergic rhinitis at seasonal allergen exposure.",

A similar use of anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs in allergic rhinitis is in our opinion not likely, in part reflecting that existing treatment options are very good and in part inherited difficulties with current anti-TNF\u03b1 approaches. However, the human nasal airway and allergic rhinitis can be used to monitor effects of TNF\u03b1 (this study) and anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs. This may be particularly valid since there are key similarities between inflammatory processes of the upper and lower airways, since observations made in upper airway conditions frequently can be translated to the bronchial airway diseases, and since nasal airway studies are easier to perform. In this context, the present findings suggest, indirectly, that beneficial effects of anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs in refractory asthma may reflect anti-neutrophil rather than anti-eosinophil effects.",
