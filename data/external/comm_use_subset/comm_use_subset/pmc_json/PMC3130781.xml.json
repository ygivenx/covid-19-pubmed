Ceacam1 thus inhibits T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and suppresses multiple aspects of T cell function. Ceacam1 agonists attenuate cytokine secretion, T cell polarization and cytolytic function. In vivo, ligation of Ceacam1 with soluble ligands or over-expression of ITIM-containing Ceacam1 isoforms on T cells attenuates experimental colitis [7], [8]. Additionally, Ceacam1 is also expressed on intestinal T cells in patients with Celiac disease [15] and ulcerative colitis [16], and may represent an attempt by the immune system to negatively regulate these inflammatory processes.",

In the context of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 recipients, we therefore tested the radiation sensitivity of Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice used as hosts, by irradiating WT and Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 BALB/c mice and assessing survival. Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 animals showed increased kinetics of mortality, and in some cases, overall mortality after radiation injury (\nFigure 4A\n). Similar results were obtained on the B6 background (\nFigure 4C\n). We then enumerated regenerating and surviving crypts in the small intestine (terminal ileum) at 84 hours after irradiation to assess intestinal radiation damage, and observed that Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice had fewer regenerating and surviving crypts as compared with WT counterparts (\nFigure 4B and D\n), indicating greater damage to the small intestine across a wide range of radiation doses. It is thus quite likely that our radiation-containing conditioning regimen for transplant recipients also contributes in part to their survival kinetics, selective GVHD target organ damage (\nFigure 2G\u2013H\n), and the selective accumulation of donor T cells in lymphoid tissues and target organs (\nFigure 3C\n) in these recipients.",

However, WT vs. Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 CD4 effector T cells had similar integrin \u03b27 subunit expression, yet also accumulated in greater numbers in the gut (\nFigure 3A\n), suggesting that regulation of target organ damage by Ceacam1 is very likely to involve multiple additional mechanisms beyond trafficking molecule expression. Additionally, levels of the \u03b1E subunit, which forms integrin \u03b1E\u03b27, were similar, as were levels of CCR9, CD31, PSGL1, CCR7, CXCR3, and LFA1 (data not shown).",

In addition, Ceacam1 on donor T cells and tumors may modulate GVT activity. Ceacam1 on both the donor allograft and recipient tissues thus appears to represent an important regulator of GVHD and GVT morbidity and mortality via both T cell dependent and independent mechanisms, suggesting that therapeutic approaches which modulate Ceacam1 may need to assess and balance GVHD vs. GVT.",

In our GVHD model systems however, we found similar T cell polarization and cytokine secretion when we analyzed donor alloreactive T cells ex vivo (\nTable 1\n). We ascribe this to the strongly proinflammatory cytokine milieu found in recipients following myeloablative radiation treatment, as well as the ubiquitous presence of alloantigen, which together promote strong Th1 differentiation regardless of Ceacam1 expression. However, in our model systems Ceacam1 regulated T cell activation, and numbers of donor alloactivated T cells in both lymphoid tissues and GVHD target tissues, in patterns that generally correlated with levels target organ damage (\nFigures 2\n\n and \n\n3\n).",

This suggests that Ceacam1 on donor T cells interacts with recipient tissues, and that Ceacam1 \u201cfraternal\u201d interactions between cells of the donor graft, were not sufficient to restrain GVHD in Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 recipients.

While Ceacam1\u2212/\u2212 mice were not significantly defective for hematopoiesis after sublethal irradiation at 3.5 and 4.5 Gy (data not shown), they did exhibit significantly increased damage to the small intestines after lethal irradiation (\nFigure 4\n).",
