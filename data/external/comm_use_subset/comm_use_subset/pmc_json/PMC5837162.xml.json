A variety of ZIKV vaccines, such as those based on inactivated or live-attenuated viruses, viral vectors, DNA, RNA, and viral proteins11\u201317, have been developed against ZIKV infection in experimental animal models, and several have progressed to clinical trials18\u201320. To date, however, no vaccines are available for human use, a situation calling for a continuous effort to develop effective and safe vaccines against ZIKV infection.",

The full-length genome of ZIKV encodes structural proteins, such as capsid (C), membrane (M) or precursor membrane (prM), and envelope (E), in addition to non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5)21,22, among which E protein is the major protein for inducing neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV infection23,24 and, thus, a main target for developing ZIKV vaccines. ZIKV E protein consists of domain I (DI), domain II (DII), domain III (DIII), a stalk region, and a transmembrane domain (Supplementary Figure S1A)25. A number of ZIKV E-based vaccines were developed targeting prM-E or full-length E11,14,16,26, whereas a few have attempted to target fragments of ZIKV E protein domains, particularly EDIII, to identify important regions in the E protein for developing more effective and safer ZIKV vaccines27.",

Sera collected at 2 months after immunization were tested for cross-neutralization against nine ZIKV strains isolated from different hosts (human, mosquito, and rhesus), various countries and regions (Colombia, Honduras, Panama, Puerto Rico, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and Uganda), and different periods of time (1947, 1968, 2013, 2015, and 2016) (Supplementary Figure S4A). These ZIKV strains belong to diverse phylogenetic groups (Supplementary Figure S4B) and have a number of amino acid variations among their E proteins (Supplementary Figure S4C). Compared with the E296-406 and E301-404 fragments, the E298-409 fragment induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies able to cross-neutralize all ZIKV strains tested (Fig. 1), including those with different EDIII sequences, e.g., PRVABC59 (isolated from a patient in an American country), IbH 30656 (isolated from a patient in an African country), and MR 766 (isolated from a rhesus macaque in an African country), and those with the same EDIII sequences, e.g., FLR, R103451, PAN2015, PAN2016, MEX 2-81 (isolated from patients or mosquitoes in American countries), and PLCal_ZV (isolated from a patient in an Asian country) (Supplementary Figure S4).

The data from the antibody test revealed that although all three EDIII fragments were able to elicit long-term EDIII-specific IgG antibodies, those induced by the E298-409 and E301-404 fragments showed significantly higher titers than that induced by the E296-406 fragment (Fig. 2Aa). These IgG antibodies were further tested using a ZIKV E protein containing residues 1\u2013454, and the results showed that the E-specific IgG antibodies corresponded to the respective EDIII-specific IgG antibodies induced by the three EDIII fragments (Fig. 2Ab). Compared to E301-404, E298-409 elicited a relatively higher titer of EDIII-specific IgG1 (Th2-associated) antibodies (Fig. 2Ac) but a similar level of IgG2a (Th1-associated) antibodies (Fig. 2Ad). E296-406 induced the lowest titers of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies among the three fragments in the test months (Fig. 2Ac, d). E298-409 elicited more potent long-term neutralizing antibody responses than E296-406 and E301-404 against ZIKV R103451 (Fig. 2Ba) and FLR (Fig. 2Bb) strains for at least 10 months (Fig. 2B). In contrast, control PBS induced only background levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies against the two tested ZIKV strains (Fig. 2). The above data indicate that ZIKV EDIII fragments, especially E298-409, maintained the immunogenicity required to elicit long-term EDIII and E-specific antibody responses, particularly neutralizing antibody responses against infection with variant epidemic human ZIKV strains.",

Seven-day-old newborn mice (pups) are a convenient and effective means for evaluating the protective efficacy of ZIKV vaccines, as they are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection17. Therefore, we initially used pups born to immunized female BALB/c mice at 7 months post immunization for ZIKV challenge (Supplementary Figure S3B). Theoretically, if pups receive anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies from their mothers during pregnancy, they are expected to be protected against ZIKV infection. To test the protective efficacy of ZIKV EDIII fragments, pups were challenged with 5 \u00d7 104 PFU of the aforementioned two epidemic human ZIKV strains, R103451 and FLR, and the resulting survival and weight, as well as the neutralizing antibodies from mothers and pups, were evaluated.",

All pups born to the above three EDIII fragment-immunized mice had increased weights during the detection period (14 days) after challenge with both R103451 (Fig. 3c) and FLR (Fig. 3d) strains. The evaluation of the neutralizing antibodies revealed that, similar to the immunized mothers, pups from E298-409-immunized mice had the highest neutralizing antibody titers among the three treatments against R103451 (Fig. 3e) and FLR (Fig. 3f) strains. In contrast to the above results, pups born to the mice injected with PBS did not survive challenge with the R103451 (Fig. 3a) and FLR (Fig. 3b) strains, and all of them died at 10 and 11 days p.i., respectively, with decreased weights 4 and 6 days post-challenge with R103451 (Fig. 3c) or FLR (Fig. 3d). This result is mainly because no neutralizing antibodies were detected in the mothers injected with PBS (Fig. 3e, f). The above results demonstrated that pups born to mice immunized with ZIKV EDIII fragments, particularly E298-409, were protected against infection with divergent ZIKV strains, possibly because maternal neutralizing antibodies had been transferred via placenta from mothers to fetuses during pregnancy.",

The qRT-PCR results demonstrated that mice receiving anti-E298-409 sera had significantly reduced viral titers in tissues, including brain, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney, and sera after challenge with ZIKV R103451 or FLR strain, compared with the sham control mice that did not receive sera (Fig. 6A). Analysis of pathological changes revealed that control A129 mice had severe brain damage with enhanced neuronal eosinophilia, neuronal necrosis, T-cell proliferation, and focal bleeding in the brain tissues (Fig. 6Bb), as well as serious interstitial inflammation, focal bleeding, epithelial cell degeneration, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissues (Fig. 6Bd). In contrast, the anti-E298-409 sera-treated A129 mice demonstrated considerable alleviation of tissue damage, along with significantly decreased neuronal eosinophilia and T-cell proliferation in the brain tissues (Fig. 6Ba) and slight interstitial inflammation, epithelial cell degeneration, and inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissues (Fig. 6Bc).",

The identified E298-409 fragment with the highest neutralizing potential had the protective efficacy to protect newborns and lethal adult A129 mice against the two epidemic human strains of ZIKV tested. These data suggest that the N- and C-terminal residues of ZIKV EDIII have important roles in inducing protective neutralizing antibodies and that an appropriate extension of EDIII residues to the N-terminal DI region and C-terminal stalk region (Supplementary Figure S1) helps in the production of effective neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV infection.",

In addition, both EDIII-specific pAb and mAb can effectively neutralize other epidemic human ZIKV strains tested, including FLR, PAN2015, PAN2016, and PRVABC59 (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting a broad neutralizing capacity of ZIKV EDIII-specific antibodies against infection with ZIKV, particularly the pandemic human strains. As a number of variations have been demonstrated in the different strains of ZIKV tested, including viral E proteins (Supplementary Figure S4), the ability of the identified critical neutralizing domain of EDIII (e.g., E298-409) to induce cross-neutralization and protective efficacy will be beneficial and provide useful guidance for the development of effective vaccines to protect against current and future epidemic ZIKV strains.",

We confirmed that the pups born to E298-409-immunized mice had highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and were fully protected against lethal ZIKV challenge.
