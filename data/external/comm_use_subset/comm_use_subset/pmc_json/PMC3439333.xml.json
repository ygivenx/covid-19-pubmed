The majority of these studies have focused on either natural infections from the community or induced infections in the laboratory, with very few studies considering the infection risk or outcome of laboratory personnel handling the samples. The potential of an accidental laboratory-acquired infection is well-recognized among laboratory staff and researchers. In 1941, Meyer and Eddie published the first report of laboratory infections due to the Gram-negative bacteria Brucella [1]. In 1949, Sulkin and Pike published a report that summarized 222 laboratory-acquired infections due to viruses [2]. Since then, significant efforts have been made by the oversight committees of research institutes and governmental bodies to establish occupational and environmental safety guidelines to protect workers and the local community alike from laboratory-acquired infections; however, these infections have yet to be eradicated and many have been reported over the past eight decades [3-9].",

In contrast, the relative frequency of viral laboratory-acquired infections has increased by 60% [13]. Research into the underlying factors responsible for these infections have indicated that the main route of infection, for both bacteria and viruses [9,14-20], is through mucous membranes that are contaminated by inhaling pathogens, not dissimilar from the natural route of infection [21]. Traditionally, the risk of laboratory infection has been minimized by simply practicing good laboratory practice (GLP), which is otherwise necessary for reliability of the laboratory work itself. A detailed examination of the publically available information on all reported laboratory-acquired infections, however, indicated that ~80% were not the result of overt \"accidents\"; it is, thus, likely that inhalation of aerosolized infectious particles that are liberated by normal laboratory techniques account for a large portion of laboratory-acquired infections.",

Many of the routine procedures used to process influenza virus for laboratory research, such as centrifugation or mixing, have a high potential of producing aerosols [21], and the particle load of each has been estimated to be up to 1\u20135 \u03bcm. In addition, it is expected that larger particles will tend to fall out of the air and contaminate surfaces, by which individuals may be infected by contact or may transmit the particles to a secondary aerosol [4]. Fundamentally, aerosols are suspensions in the air of solid or liquid particles small enough that they will remain transmissible and airborne for a prolonged period of time [23]. Particles of 5 \u03bcm or less increase the risk of establishing an infection upon airborne transmission, as they are remarkably capable of penetrating the physical cellular barrier of the respiratory tract and traveling all the way to the alveolar region. As with naturally-acquired infections, most individuals are not diagnosed before onset of symptoms, impeding the time to initiation of treatment [24].",

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) eventually dismissed this theory, suspicion and panic were aroused in the general public about laboratory safety. There are many situations that may facilitate the spread of a pathogen from the laboratory, ranging from aerosols produced by routine procedures or misuse of laboratory equipment to uncontrollable natural disasters that impact the structural integrity of the laboratory, such as earthquake or fire. In order to regulate the potential of pathogen transmission from the laboratory, we must first gain a detailed understanding of the experimental operations that produce aerosols. To this end, this study was designed to monitor the presence of aerosolized H5N1 virus produced by normal procedures used to process the virus for experimental research and by the most frequently associated \u201caccidents\u201d for each, such as container breakage and accidental subcutaneous injection. This information will help to guide future experimental practice standards to ensure the safety of laboratories and laboratory personnel, thereby increasing community confidence in laboratory bio-safety.",

We used liquid impingers, which rely on inertial collection mechanisms to collect aerosolized particles [30] and were situated as described in the Materials and Methods. The sampler outlet was situated above the nozzle outlet; thus, there was a sharp turn in flow streamlines at the nozzle outlet, just above the liquid surface. Particles with high inertia cannot follow sharp turns in streamlines and will impact and penetrate the liquid surface after exiting the nozzle.",

            "text": "In fact, all of the studies performed to date by others to determine whether laboratory studies of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and fungi, could generate infective aerosols have been based on statistical analysis of actual infections. The influenza viruses present a particular challenge to monitoring in the lab by traditional methods, since their small size and low concentration make them difficult to collect and detect from the air. Most of the bioaerosol samplers currently on the market are not suitable for collection of viruses [31]. Furthermore, effective detectors need to be able to conveniently collect air samples at various time points over the course of an entire experiment since virus-containing aerosols may be generated by any number of steps in the process and then fall from the air prior to an end-of-procedure sampling time point. The currently available samplers typically run for short periods of time (minutes), making it difficult to capture large volumes or integrate sample collection over time. We designed a collector terminal with six air pollution sampling probes that are able to continuously sample the air for \u226510 h; in addition, this device is portable and can be easily moved around the laboratory to locales where different steps of the experiment are performed. The feature of remote control allows for simultaneous or sequential collection in different locales from two or more of the probes. In the study described herein, to test the capability of such a detector, the aerosols collected during the experiment reflected the virus produced in most operations; this study was not designed to clearly delineate a complete picture of all potential applications of this device.",

            "text": "Measuring infectious virus from air samples is logistically difficult. Few researchers have reported airborne influenza virus from the laboratory, and even fewer have detected the infectious capacity of influenza viruses sampled from air. Traditional methods of determining the presence of virus in an aerosol include directly applying the concentrated aerosol to infect a host cell, or as template in Rt-PCR to detect virus-specific genes. One of the most commonly used methods is Rt-PCR because of its remarkable sensitivity and specificity; however, Rt-PCR is unable to determine whether the detected virus is infectious. In our study, we combined experimental approaches that would determine both the concentration of virus in aerosols and the activity of those viruses. By exploiting the functional character of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, we were able to estimate the concentration of influenza virus in aerosols according to the amount of adsorption that occurred with red blood cells (RBCs). By also using the aerosols to directly inoculate chick embryos, we were able to determine the ability of the aerosolized virus to proliferate in vivo, indicating the infectivity of the contaminating pathogens. Future studies will aim to determine the feasibility of this approach for quantifying virus in the aerosol.",

Our results provide evidence that many of the laboratory techniques used to process influenza virus for experimental analysis produce aerosols and, thereby, represent significant risks of infection to laboratory personnel and potential spread beyond the laboratory. Working in the laboratory is inevitably dangerous, but nearly all risks can be sufficiently minimized by GLP and careful monitoring of risk factors, such as presence of pathogen-containing aerosols. According to the results of this study, we plan to extend our investigations to emergency operating procedures that follow laboratory accidents with virus samples and to generate more effective strategies to prevent laboratory-generated aerosols and laboratory-acquired infections or spread.",

The flow rate was 12.5 L min-1, when the pressure drop across the orifice was 41 cm Hg. The tip of the capillary stem was situated 30 mm from the flask bottom; therefore, when filled with 20 mL of liquid, the nozzle outlet was 10 mm above the resting liquid surface. Airborne biological particles drawn into the 1 mm diameter nozzle and down the capillary stem, then impacted and penetrated the liquid surface [32]. The adhesion properties involving liquid and airborne particles were exploited by this technology to capture the microorganisms [33].",

In group I (zootomy), chickens diagnosed with AIV upon autopsy were sectioned and the excised tissues frozen at \u221220\u00b0C. The total collection time was 1 h. Disinfection of the anatomical units after collection and air sampling took an additional 1 h. Control air samples were taken in the same units one day later. This process was repeated a total of six times, and six chickens were necropsied. In group II (grinding), the frozen lung tissues were thawed, ground in a mortar, and transferred to a centrifuge tube for storage at 4\u00b0C. Aerosol collections were carried out during grinding (at 20 min into the procedure) and 10 min after the homogenate was collected, for a total of 30 min. After disinfection of the area, air samples were immediately collected. This entire process was repeated six times. In group III (centrifugation) the tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Air samples were collected from the point of initial handling of the centrifuge tube to the centrifuge to the end of the spin when the centrifuge instrument was opened and the tube removed. To balance the centrifuge for each spin, the six homogenates were processed in groups of two, so that the experiment was repeated three times. Air sampling was performed after disinfection for use as the control. Collection times were 30 min. In group IV (pipetting), the supernatant resulting from the centrifugation step was transferred by a pipettor to a new tube, using blow-out and pull-in processes a total of 10 times to mix each sample. To ensure continuity of the experimental integrity, the pipetting experiment was carried out in another similar laboratory room that did not communicate with the centrifuge room. The same air sampling procedure was carried out for 30 min during the experiment and after disinfection. Similar to group III, the procedures of group IV were repeated three times. In group V (magnetic stirring), the virus-containing supernatant samples were diluted with PBS (pH 7.2) in a 10-fold series. This occurred by taking 1 mL of supernatant and adding to PBS in a 9 mL beaker with a stir bar that was placed on an active magnetic stirrer. Air sampling occurred throughout the entire process and after disinfection of the space, three times at 30 min each. In group VI (egg inoculation), 10 chick embryos (about 9-days-old) were inoculated with 0.2 mL diluted virus sample (10-fold diluted virus stock solution) per embryo. Air samples were collected throughout the process, including the time when the virus was drawn into the syringe, air bubbles were removed from the syringe, chick embryos were injected, and sealing wax was applied. A total of 10 chicken embryos were inoculated in each air monitoring experiment. Air samples were collected throughout and after disinfection, taking 30 min. The procedure was repeated three times, requiring a total of 30 chick embryos to be inoculated. In group VII (zoogenetic infection), five chickens (7-days-old) was intranasally administered virus at a dose of 0.2 mL per chicken. The zoogenetic infection experiments were repeated three times. Air sampling was carried out at intervals of 30 min each, and after disinfection.",
