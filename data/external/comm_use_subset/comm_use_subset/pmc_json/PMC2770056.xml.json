All members of this order share a similar genome organization and common mechanisms of genome replication and gene expression, and, as with other RNA viruses with limited coding capacity, they exploit cellular proteins and pathways to facilitate many aspects of their replication cycle [1-3]. Identification of host-virus interactions can provide new insights into viral biology and developing new ways to combat viral infections via control of host components.",

There is now compelling evidence that enveloped virions (including members of Mononegavirales) released from infected cells carry numerous host (cellular) proteins some of which may play an important role in viral replication [4]. Several cellular proteins have been previously shown to be incorporated into VSV virions including tubulin [5], cyclophilin A [6], translation elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1a) [7], RNA guanylyltransferase [8], casein kinase II [9] and heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (Hsc70, also known as HSPA8) [10].

Here we attempted the same strategy to identify cellular proteins within purified VSV virions, thereby creating a \"snapshot\" of one stage of virus/host interaction that can guide future experiments aimed at understanding molecular mechanisms of virus-cell interactions.

Based on this analysis (data not shown), we selected three cell lines, capable of producing the high VSV titers: BHK21 (baby hamster kidney cells), 4T1 (mouse mammary tumor cells) and A549 (human lung carcinoma cells) (Fig. 1). BHK21 has been extensively used as a standard cell line for growing VSV. A549 and 4T1 cells also supported suitable viral replication although to lower titers than BHK21 cells (Fig. 2B). The use of different cell lines allowed us to compare viral host protein content across species and cell types. In addition, the A549 and 4T1 cell lines were included to allow identification of cellular proteins potentially lacking sufficient homology to human or mouse proteins to be recognized from a hamster source (BHK21).",

VSV HR1 is a well characterized mRNA cap methylation defective VSV (Indiana serotype) host-range (hr) mutant which has a delay in replication but achieves wild type titers in BHK21 [26-29]. VSV HR1 was chosen for BHK21 infection as the milder cytopathic effect in BHK21 cells compared to VSV-wt aid exclusion of cellular debris (data not shown). However, VSV-wt was used for infection of A549 and 4T1 cells as replication of VSV HR1 was more inhibited in these two cell lines than in BHK21 due to its host-range growth phenotype (data not shown) and the cytopathic effect caused by VSV-wt in these cells was not as rapid or severe as seen with BHK21.",

            "text": "Virion samples were examined by transmission electron microscopy (EM) for the presence of nonviral structures and to assess virion integrity. As shown in Figure 2A, the sample derived from BHK21 cells was primarily composed of particles readily recognizable as VSV although the possibility of some cellular contaminants cannot be ruled out. In addition to standard \"bullet shaped\" particles, there were also large numbers of \"bent\" particles where the virion appears to have been broken in half. These bent particles have been shown to be a substantial component of at least some VSV preparations and are infectious [31]. The presence of other \"irregular\" particles is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that VSV virions can easily undergo morphological changes when processed for visualization by EM [33,34]. In contrast to the BHK21 preparation, the virion preparations from A549 and 4T-1 showed fewer intact virus particles, and a large number of unwound nucleocapids could be seen (Fig. 2A). Some of the membranous structures present may represent the viral membranes dissociated from the nucleocapsids, although the possibility of them being cellular vesicles cannot be ruled out [35]. Consistent with the differences observed by EM (Fig. 2A) was the variation in the number of infectious particles per \u03bcg of total protein (Fig. 2B). However, when equal quantities of total protein were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomassie staining (Fig. 2D) or analyzed by immunoblotting against VSV proteins (data not shown), the quantity and distribution of the viral proteins was similar in all samples as were the intensity and number of minor bands representing cellular or degraded viral proteins. Additionally, when total RNA extracted from samples containing equal quantities of protein was analyzed by Northern blotting using a probe complimentary to the 3' end of VSV genome, greater numbers of viral genomes were recovered from purified virus samples from 4T1 and A549 than from BHK21 cells (Fig. 2C). Smaller products representing defecting interfering genomic RNAs were not detected in any sample, even upon overexposure of the membrane (data not shown). This supports our hypothesis that the filament structures seen in Figure 2A for A549 and 4T1 virion preparations are unwound VSV nucleocapids containing viral genomic RNA. That these filaments are not cellular nucleic acids is also supported by the lack of detection of any histone or ribosomal proteins in the A549 and 4T1 samples by MS (Table 1). Together, the Northern blot (Fig. 2C) and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2D) data suggest the observed visual differences between samples (Fig. 2A) are at least in part due to differences in particle stability/infectivity rather than simply sample purity.",

A portion of the treated virions from 4T1 cells were additionally purified by centrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion. This process removed the proteinase and cleaved peptides and aided removal of any residual contaminating vesicles as proteinase treatment would decrease the density of vesicles to a greater extent than the virions [39].

In contrast, substantial amounts of the viral matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P) and large polymerase (L) proteins were protected from ProK activity by the viral membrane, although we estimate that about 50% of these proteins were lost from the BHK21 derived virions during this process, about 70% from the 4T1 derived virions and about 90% from the ProK treated and additionally purified 4T1 derived virions. This loss of presumably membrane-protected proteins was likely due to physical disruption of the virion membrane, and the differences in protein loss were consistent with the varying degrees of virion disruption observed by EM (Fig. 2A). Due to the high loss of protein from the 4T1 derived sample, we were unable to obtain sufficiently concentrated ProK-treated virions derived from 4T-1 cells without additional purification, so slightly less than 50 \u03bcg of this virus was used for immunoblotting (Fig. 3A-B, sample 4T-1 + ProK).",

This sample consistently showed a high level of protection of these proteins except for annexin 2 which can be located either intracellularly or on the extracellular membrane, and therefore a portion of it is likely vulnerable to ProK degradation [40].

Without heat shock, Hsp72 was also easily detected in A549 lysates, weakly detected in 4T-1 lysates and not detected at all in BHK21 lysates. In keeping with this, Hsp72 could be detected in virions from A549 cells but was not seen in virions from 4T1 or BHK21 cells. That Hsp72 was detected equally well in all the heat shocked lysates suggests these differences are not solely due to variable antibody recognition of Hsp72 from different sources. VSV infection did not appear to induce Hsp72 expression at the time point analyzed. Immunoblotting also confirmed the presence of cyclophilin A (Fig. 3D) in virions derived from BHK21 and 4T1 cells (the A549 preparation was not tested for this protein).",

In total, our analysis successfully identified all five VSV proteins as well as 64 cellular proteins (Table 1), plus keratins. For the majority of the identified proteins, the predicted molecular weight was consistent with the size range encompassed by the 1-D SDS-PAGE gel slice the protein was found in, which served as an additional confirmation of the cellular protein identity. However, the two groups of proteins, keratins (identified but not shown in Table 1) and ubiquitin (Table 1), were broadly distributed among the gel slices. Keratins are common environmental contaminants and their broad distribution among the gel slices without correlation to the predicted molecular weight suggests contamination as the primary source of the keratin peptides identified in our MS analysis. Ubiquitin was also detected across a wide range of molecular weights, suggesting that at least some viral and/or cellular proteins within VSV virions are ubiquitinated, although phospholipid anchored ubiquitin (not linked to any protein) has been found in the envelopes of several different viruses [44,45]. Further studies are needed to determine the functional role of ubiquitin association with VSV virions.",

Therefore, it is possible that some of the cellular proteins normally present within viral particles were \"leaked out\" during virus purification from A549 and 4T1 cells (accounting for their absence in those preparations). Furthermore, it is possible that some cellular proteins found in the A549 and 4T1 preparations are associated with free nucleocapsids rather than the virions. These differences in virion properties may have also impacted some of the other assays used in this study. For example, genome isolation may have been more efficient from the A549 and 4T1 samples, perhaps partially accounting for the higher number of genomes detected in these preparations. It may have also had an effect on the proteinase K assay as suggested by the fact that approximately 70% of the supposedly internal viral proteins were degraded when virions isolated from 4T1 cells were treated with proteinase K as opposed to approximately 50% for virions isolated from BHK21 cells.",

An apparent example of the former is Hsp72 which has been shown to enhance measles virus transcription [41,42] and is a determinant of measles neurovirulence in mice [43]. This protein was not specifically detected by our MS analysis although the closely related and constitutively expressed Hsc70 protein was identified (Table 1 and Figure 3), as were several peptides common to both Hsc70 and Hsp72. Upon heat shock, Hsp72 could be detected by immunoblotting in lysates from all three cell types, but in the absence of this stress, was easily detectable in A549 lysates, weakly detected in 4T1 lysates and not detected at all in BHK21 lysates. In keeping with this expression profile, Hsp72 could be detected only in virions from A549, demonstrating that, at least in some cases, host cell protein expression may affect incorporation of cellular proteins into virions.",

We have initiated this process for several proteins of potential interest whose presence in the virion has not previously been shown (Hsp90, actin, annexin 2, and integrin \u03b21), by confirming their presence in our virion preparations by immunoblotting, and, for the non-membrane proteins, confirming their presence within the virion by proteinase K protection assay (Fig. 3B and data not shown).",

Actin has previously been shown to be incorporated into Sendai [48], measles [49] and rabies [50] virions but was not detected in VSV virions [50]. Here, using MS, we have shown actin to be present within VSV as well (Table 1). Annexins bind phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner and are believed to help direct membrane-membrane and membrane cytoskeleton interactions. In particular, annexin 2 has been proposed to facilitate HIV-1 assembly at cellular membranes [23]. Integrin \u03b21 forms heterodimers with various alpha integrins that function in both cell adhesion and cell signaling. While proteins found in multiple preparations may not be more important than those found only a single sample, the presence of annexin 2 and integrin \u03b21 in all three samples as well as in a number of other viruses (for example, integrin \u03b21 has also been detected in influenza, HIV-1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus), suggests that these two proteins may be involved in widely used viral processes (see far right column of Table 1 for complete listing and references). In fact, many of the cellular proteins identified in our study have been found in association with the virions of different RNA and DNA viruses (Table 1) suggesting that enveloped viruses may use similar cellular pathways for their assembly and exit from the cell. Currently, a similar study using a proteomics approach is being conducted in our laboratory to identify cellular proteins in virions of other members of the family Mononegavirales. Such comparative analysis will reveal how similar or different the cellular content of virions are among different members of this order.",

However, we recognize the potential of proteins not associated with virions to persist in our preparations despite purification and that these would also be identified by a global proteomics approach. Additionally, the inclusion of a protein within the virion does not necessarily imply a functional significance. Therefore, future experiments are needed to determine which of the identified proteins interact with VSV and whether these interactions are beneficial, neutral or antiviral with respect to VSV replication. Identification of host proteins-virus interactions beneficial for virus would be particularly exciting as they can provide new ways to combat viral infections via control of host components.",

Monolayer cultures of these cell lines were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (Eagle's MEM, Cellgro) or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Cellgro) supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. Infectivity (PFU/ml) of virus stocks was calculated by standard plaque assay on BHK21 cells. To grow and purify viruses, cells were infected with wt or mutant VSV and incubated at 34\u00b0C. BHK21 cells were infected with VSV HR1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005, while A549 and 4T1 cells were infected with VSV wild type (VSV-wt, Indiana serotype) at an MOI of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. VSV HR1 is a well characterized mRNA cap methylation defective VSV (Indiana serotype) mutant [26,28,29] with a mutation in the L protein with a D to V substitution at position 1671 [26,27]. This mutation completely eliminates viral mRNA cap methylation at both the guanine-N7 and 2'-O-adenosine positions [26,27] and results in subsequent non-translatability of primary VSV transcripts in non-permissive cell lines [51-53]. As a result, VSV HR1 displays a host-range (hr) phenotype characterized by severely restricted growth in most cell types but only slightly delayed growth in a limited number of \"permissive\" cells including BHK21 cell line where it achieves wild type titers.",

Briefly, samples were separated by a 68 min linear gradient from 90% Solvent I (0.1% formic acid in water)/Solvent II (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) to 50% Solvent I/II at a flow rate of 500 nl/min on reversed phase chromatography using a trap/elute method with a in-house C18 sample trap in line with a C18 analytical column. The spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm of the Bioworks software (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA; version SRF v. 3) against the IPI.HUMAN.v.3.18 and IPI.MOUSE.v.3.18 databases concatenated with a VSV protein database. A parent ion mass tolerance of 2.0 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.0 Da, and a 16 Da differential modification for methionine oxidation were used for search parameters. Protein identifications were accepted when the peptide probability was greater than 95.0% [54], the protein probability was greater than 99.0%, and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Scaffold software was used for data compiling of each group and calculating spectral count [55-57].",
