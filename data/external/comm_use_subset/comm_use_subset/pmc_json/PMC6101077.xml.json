            "text": "There are many types of viruses that cause a wide variety of viral infections or viral diseases. For example, more than 11,000 deaths were reported in Africa during the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in 2014 and 2015 [1]. More recently, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2], which began with a patient in an emergency room, occurred in South Korea. So far, there is no specific vaccine or effective treatment for Ebola virus and MERS-CoV [1, 2]. Viral infection involves a large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and its host. These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a same species rather than for PPIs across different species. Methods for predicting intra-species PPIs do not distinguish interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species, and thus are not appropriate for predicting inter-species PPIs. Motivated by a recent increase in data of virus-host PPIs, a few computational methods have been developed to predict virus-host PPIs using machine learning methods. For instance, a homology-based method [3] and domain-based method [4] were proposed to predict PPIs between H. sapiens and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Cui et al. [5] developed a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict PPIs between human and two types of viruses (hepatitis C virus and human papillomavirus). However, these prediction methods cannot be applied to new viruses or new hosts that have no known PPIs to the methods. Inter-species PPIs predicted by these methods are for PPIs between virus of a single type and host of a single type. A recent SVM model called DeNovo is perhaps the only one that can predict PPIs of new viruses with a shared host [6]. Amino acid sequence similarity between different types of viruses or hosts is relatively low, so sequence-based prediction of virus-host PPIs for new viruses or hosts is quite challenging. In this study, we developed a new prediction method of virus-host PPIs which is applicable to new viruses or hosts. The rest of this paper discusses the details of the method and its experimental results.",

The sequences of the proteins involved in any of the PPIs were obtained from the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org). As of December 2016, there are a total of 12,157 PPIs between 29 hosts and 332 viruses (Table 1). The reason that human is listed as a separate category from other animals (i.e., non-human animals) in the classification of hosts is because human has a much larger number of known PPIs with viruses than other animals.

In particular, one of the challenges in sequence-based prediction of virus-host PPIs is to represent two types of proteins of variable lengths into a feature vector of a fixed length. Several encoding schemes have been used to represent protein sequences for predicting PPIs. For instance, Shen et al. [9] clustered 20 amino acids into seven groups, and represented the relative frequency of three consecutive amino acids (referred to \u2019amino acid triplet\u2019) in a protein sequence using the classification. In our previous work [5], we redefined the relative frequency of an amino acid triplet using six groups of amino acids. However, both Shen\u2019s representation and ours generate a feature vector with many zero-valued elements, which lower the prediction performance.",

In a 5-fold cross validation with virus\u2013host PPIs from VirusMINT [15], their SVM showed higher sensitivity and F1 score than Na\u00efve Bayes and Random Forest.

However, proteins of new viruses or hosts often exhibit quite a low sequence similarity to proteins of known viruses or hosts, and little information is available for new viruses or hosts.",
