In Thailand, an estimated 19,122 deaths were thought to be caused by multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections in 2010.6 Given that antibiotic use, even with narrow-spectrum agents, drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR), interventions that achieve safe reductions in antibiotic use are needed.",

However, average symptom duration was reduced by only 16 hours.7 Reducing the risk of complications is often used as a justification for antibiotic treatment, but a large cohort study from 2006 to 2009, albeit from a high-income setting (UK), found the risk of suppurative complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy, and cellulitis) to be around 1% with or without antibiotic treatment. There were no cases of acute rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.8 Nonetheless, these findings may not be applicable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is higher. The 2015 global burden of disease study found a high burden of rheumatic heart disease in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan Africa. The burden is lower in Southeast Asia, and Thailand is considered non-endemic for rheumatic heart disease.9 Current guidelines recommend antibiotics for pharyngitis caused by GAS and that narrow-spectrum penicillins are most suitable.10,11 Concern is growing about increasing levels of GAS resistance to macrolide antibiotics.12,13",

Alternatives for use in primary care include rapid antigen testing, clinical scores such as Centor and FeverPAIN, and biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP).

This finding is not limited to this study but was also seen in all primary care units in the same district of Chiang Rai in a previous review of antibiotic use in primary care and is consistent with the Thai antibiotic guidelines, which give the option of treatment with penicillin V or amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis.4,5 Given the current concern about the development of AMR, largely fueled by overuse of antibiotics,40,41 where possible it is intuitive to use narrow-spectrum (i.e., penicillin V) rather than broad-spectrum (i.e., amoxicillin) antibiotics.

Depending on the guidance followed, prescription rates would vary greatly within this cohort of patients. Using isolation of GAS from a throat swab as the indicator for antibiotic treatment in accordance with current guidance, 11/169 (6.5%) cases would require antibiotics, and this would increase to 29/169 (17.2%) if group C and G Streptococci were also treated. If a CRP threshold of more than 8 mg/L had been used, 93/168 (55.4%) patients would have been prescribed an antibiotic, missing 2/11 (18.2%) patients with the presence of GAS. This may seem like a low CRP cutoff clinically, but the medium CRP level for those presenting with a sore throat and fever was 9 mg/L. In primary care, diagnostic tests are mostly used to rule out rather than rule in serious infections, and increasing the CRP cutoff would reduce its sensitivity. With a Centor score of 3 or 4, 4/169 (2.4%) patients would require an antibiotic compared with 18/169 (10.7%) patients with a FeverPAIN score of 4 or 5, with a further 120 (71.0%) potentially being prescribed antibiotics because of a FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. All of these interventions would reduce antibiotic prescription compared with routine care, where 88.4% of patients diagnosed with tonsillitis or pharyngitis in this setting are prescribed an antibiotic (almost exclusively amoxicillin).4",

Clinical scores are feasible, although whether they reliably identify GAS infection is questionable as indicated by our data and previous studies.25,42 Current high prescription rates in routine care also indicate that healthcare workers have limited confidence in withholding antibiotics based on clinical scores alone.4 Point-of-care CRP tests give results within minutes, making their use in primary care a feasible option. However, although patients with GAS had significantly higher median CRP levels, the association between a CRP > 8 mg/L, Centor scores of \u2265 3, and FeverPAIN scores of \u2265 4 and GAS detection was poor. Withholding antibiotics from patients with a CRP of \u2264 8 mg/L would miss 2/11 (18.2%) patients with positive throat swabs for GAS. This could be explained by the imperfect sensitivity of CRP but could also be due to GAS carriage rather than active infection. Both patients had a Centor score of 1 and FeverPAIN score of 2; neither had antibiotics prescribed at the index consultation, yet both had symptom resolution by day 14. The specificity of CRP testing to identify pharyngitis caused by GAS is poor as CRP can be raised in other infections and inflammatory processes.45",

Cervical lymph node examination was not recorded, limiting the possible Centor score to 3 rather than 4. This could lead to the underestimation of Centor scores and may have affected the ability of the scores to identify pharyngitis caused by GAS. The FeverPAIN scores may also be imprecise as the presence of tonsillar exudate and inflamed tonsils were collected from descriptions of abnormal throat examination. However, we may have overestimated the number of patients with fever in the last 24 hours as 73.4% of patients had a history of fever lasting more than one day.",

This study was nested within a larger clinical trial on point-of-care CRP testing to guide antibiotic use in febrile illnesses.

Penicillin is the most appropriate empirical antibiotic for those needing treatment. Surveillance of macrolide resistance is required, and susceptibility testing may be warranted for those with penicillin allergies. Identifying which patients with pharyngitis require antibiotic prescription remains challenging and requires further data from larger studies. However, despite our small sample size, CRP levels were higher in patients from whom GAS was isolated than in those without BHS isolation. Relying on CRP testing alone would result in high levels of antibiotic prescription for sore throats (49.7%), but in some settings, including Chiang Rai, this would still represent an important reduction in antibiotic prescription compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through the use of clinical scores is likely to be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.",
