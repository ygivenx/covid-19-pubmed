Multivariable logistic regression and GLM models were constructed using factors that were significant at p<0.2 in the bi-variate analysis.

Young children <2 years old could be a logical initial target population if a nationwide influenza immunization program is implemented in the future. Maternal immunization could also be considered to protect infants <6 months old [20].

However, in most years, influenza activity was most pronounced during July to November, a period of low precipitation, relatively lower temperatures, and variable humidity in Kenya [22], [23], and activity was minimal during December and January, which tend to be the warmest months of the year in Kenya [22]. This same seasonal influenza pattern has been described in neighboring Uganda [24]. However, in Kenya, influenza circulated year-round and was detected during a minimum of ten months per year throughout the six year period. In some years, like 2011, influenza also circulated early in the year, during a period typical of high temperatures and heavy rains. Year-round influenza activity has been reported in other tropical countries [25]. Although the trend of increased influenza activity in the middle of the calendar year would support the use of southern hemisphere vaccine in Kenya, the relatively continuous circulation of influenza combined with the variable seasonal peaks in some years complicates this recommendation. In addition, information about the concordance between circulating strains in Kenya and southern and northern hemisphere vaccine strains, which is being evaluated in a separate analysis, will be essential to this recommendation.",

Of the nearly 10,000 hospitalized SARI patients we followed, 0.9% of the 754 influenza-positive SARI patients died. This case-fatality ratio for influenza-associated hospitalizations is substantial. It is higher than estimates of in-hospital case-mortality rates for children in the United States [27] and Thailand [3], although it is lower than rates recently reported for seasonal and pandemic influenza in India [28]. This may reflect a difference in underlying chronic illness or acute conditions, such as HIV or malaria, which we did not routinely test for in SARI or ILI patients. In our surveillance population, the median age was very young (16 months), and the median age of patients who died was 2 years old; this contrasts with the findings from the studies in Thailand and India, where most patients who died were adults, and many were older than 50. While there were not any reports of patients who refused to be consented, it is possible that sicker patients, particularly those who died in the hospital, were not enrolled. If sick patients came into the hospital in the evening or on weekends and died in the hospital before the next weekday morning, we would not have captured them in our surveillance system. Additionally, we would have missed patients who died shortly after arriving in the hospital, before even being admitted to a hospital ward. Therefore the CFRs we report for SARI in general and influenza-associated SARI may be under-estimates. The estimated CFR should not have been affected by the surveillance project at the hospital; surveillance officers evaluated patients on admission but were not involved in patient management.",

            "text": "Our findings are subject to several limitations. First, the case definition for SARI was different for children <5 years old and persons \u22655 years old, which limited our ability to compare SARI patients across age groups. In addition, we know from previous studies in Kenya that the SARI case definition does not capture all influenza cases [17], [32]; therefore we likely missed some hospitalized influenza cases. Second, we only sampled the first three ILI patients of the day. This could have biased our ILI findings towards sicker patients or patients who lived closer to the health facilities and arrived at the clinic earlier. We did not collect data regarding non-enrolled ILI patients, which would have helped us to better understand how representative sampled ILI patients were of all ILI patients. Furthermore, our surveillance system did not include specialty wards like obstetrics; therefore we were not able to collect data on the relative burden of influenza among pregnant women, a priority group for vaccination [33]. Given that pregnant women can transfer protective antibodies to infants, for whom no influenza vaccine is currently available [20], future surveillance in Kenya should monitor pregnant women. In addition, for the last 18 months, because of budgetary constraints, we scaled back our surveillance to include only nine hospitals, all but two of which conducted SARI surveillance only. Therefore, results for this period were likely not as nationally representative compared to the previous results. This change to a more limited surveillance system reflects the sustainability challenges of conducting surveillance, particularly in resource-poor settings. Finally, our surveillance system was facility-based rather than population-based. Because we were not able to determine catchment areas for each site, and because health utilization practices vary considerably in different parts of Kenya [29], [30], we were not able to determine the overall incidence of influenza in the population. We were also not able to determine the relative hospital burden of influenza because we did not collect data on overall admissions.",

While influenza circulated year-round in Kenya, during most years, influenza activity peaked during the peak of the southern hemisphere influenza season.
