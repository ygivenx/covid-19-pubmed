            "text": "Feline foamy virus (FFV) is a retrovirus belonging to the ancient Spumaretrovirinae subfamily that infects domestic cats (Felis catus) and was originally discovered following development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in feline cell lines [1,2]. Foamy viruses (FVs) cause multiple CPEs in vitro including multinucleation, giant cell formation, and vacuolization, leading to cells looking \u201cfoamy\u201d (and where the \u201cspuma\u201d originates) [1,3,4,5]. In naturally-occurring and experimental infections of the domestic cat, however, FFV infection does not cause obvious disease, and has not been definitively associated with pathology despite establishing a persistent, life-long infection with a wide tissue tropism [3,6,7,8,9,10,11]. It is believed the apathogenicity of FVs in general is due to long periods of co-evolution with their hosts that has led to a disease-free or highly-attenuated infection [2,12,13]. FV transmission is thought to primarily occur via salivary shedding and ongoing contact between animals, though alternate routes such as vertical transmission through lactating dams have been reported [7,14]. In cats, biting and amicable prolonged contact, such as grooming, have been suggested as routes of transmission [7,15,16]. Global FFV prevalence in pet and feral domestic cats can be high and varies from 8 to 80% based on geographic location, population sampled, and assay type [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. FFV prevalence studies of cats in the USA have documented infection rates of 10 to 75%, with age and male sex identified as risk factors in some cohorts [7,16,27].",

Because of the apparent apathogenicity, wide tissue tropism, and large vector cassette packaging capacity, FVs have been used to develop vaccine and gene therapy vectors in multiple species including cats and non-human primates as a model for human therapies [10,13,36,37,38,39,40,41,42]. Many aspects about FV biology, including target cells, latency reservoirs, the specific receptor used for cell entry, viral kinetics over time following infection, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) population changes during infection have been poorly documented [6,12,43,44]. Experimental FFV infection studies in disease-free specific-pathogen-free (SPF) domestic cats with age-matched negative controls using modern and specific assays are rare; the majority have been conducted with domestic cats kept as pets or from shelters [3,6,7,8,11,38,42,45].",

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed renal diseases in cats, with prevalence rates reaching up to 85% in geriatric cats [57,58,59]. CKD is characterized by functional and structural loss of kidney tissue likely resulting from prolonged or repeated renal insults [60,61,62,63]. As renal function declines, urine concentrating ability is lost and glomerular filtration rate falls, which eventually manifests as azotemia characterized by elevated BUN and serum creatinine. While the etiologies of CKD are often unknown, a list of comorbidities have been associated with the development of CKD, including retroviral infections [64,65,66,67].",

Due to the renal findings in this study and the detection of FFV in cats suffering from urinary disease, we sought to establish if there is an association between FFV and CKD in cats. We compared FFV prevalence rates in pet cats suffering from CKD in Australia (AU) (as measured by increased blood creatinine) and compared findings to age-matched cats without evidence of CKD. We hypothesized that (1) FFV causes subtle perturbations in immunological and hematological parameters in addition to histopathological changes that could potentially lead to disease in domestic cats, and that (2) FFV is associated with chronic kidney disease in cats. We identified mildly altered hematological and biochemical parameters associated with mild histopathological changes in the lung, brain, and other tissues, and ultrastructural changes in the kidney. We additionally found that while FFV is highly prevalent in AU, there was no direct association between FFV infection and CKD pathology in our sampled population.",

Urine was collected through cystocentesis and submitted to the CSU VDL for urinalysis, urine sediment, and urine protein:creatinine (UPC) ratio determination. Urine was considered appropriately concentrated if it had a urine specific gravity (USG) over (>) 1.035. UPC ratio was considered normal if below (<) 0.2 and borderline proteinuric if between 0.2 and 0.4 [71]. On day 176 post-inoculation (pi), cats were euthanized and necropsied to assess gross pathology and harvest tissues for virus detection, histopathology, and renal-specific assays at the International Veterinary Renal Pathology Service (IVRPS) in The Ohio State University (OSU, Columbus, OH, USA).",

Absolute cell counts were then multiplied by percentages of each cell subpopulation obtained through flow cytometry for each cat per timepoint. PMBC phenotype analyses were divided into two panels: Panel A assayed T lymphocyte populations while Panel B determined number of B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes. Markers for activation (CD134+, CD125+, MHCII+) and apoptosis (Fas+) were also assayed. In total, 24 PBMC phenotypes were measured for each cat per timepoint (Table 1).

Microscopic evaluation of tissues from FFV-infected cats revealed mild (n = 3) to moderate (n = 2) lymphoid hyperplasia in retropharyngeal, submandibular, mesenteric, and prescapular lymph nodes, characterized by numerous secondary follicles that contain abundant tingible-body macrophages. The tonsils of infected animals exhibited minimal (n = 1), mild (n = 3), and moderate (n = 1) lymphoid hyperplasia with multifocal infiltration of small numbers of lymphocytes beyond the capsule in one mildly affected animal. Two infected cats exhibited mild thyroiditis characterized by multifocal infiltrates of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages within the interstitium and surrounding colloid-filled follicles of varying size. Within the ileum, Peyer\u2019s patches were minimally (n = 1) to mildly (n = 4) hyperplastic, and one animal exhibited multifocal lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates extending deep into the submucosa. Additionally, minimal (n = 3) to mild (n = 1) lymphoplasmacytic colitis was observed in FFV-infected cats, with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration into the submucosa that caused disruption of the submucosal architecture (n = 3), as well as small numbers of degenerate neutrophils scattered within the submucosa (n = 1). In the cerebrum of FFV-infected cats, there were minimally (n = 2) to mildly (n = 3) increased numbers of glial cells (gliosis) and paired astrocytes (astrocytosis) surrounding scattered neurons within the gray matter (satellitosis), a feature that was most prominently noted within the frontal lobe and thalamus (Figure 5B). Cat FFV5 also had small numbers of small lymphocytes within the meninges (lymphocytic meningitis) (Figure 5C). Scattered neurons within these regions were multifocally swollen, rounded, and demonstrated mild central dispersion of Nissl substance (chromatolysis), as well as rare, scattered neurons that exhibited hypereosinophilic and/or fragmented cytoplasm (potentially indicative of neuronal necrosis) (n = 2) (Figure 5D). One cat had mild multifocal lymphohistiocytic mastitis. Histologic changes in cat FFV5 were slightly more pronounced when compared to the other infected animals and included moderate lymphoid hyperplasia in the tonsil with moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages within the tonsil medullary sinus, and enlarged germinal centers in the Peyer\u2019s patches. Within the lung of this cat, the parabronchial interstitium and alveolar septa were multifocally expanded by small numbers of small lymphocytes, intact neutrophils, and macrophages (interpreted as mild interstitial pneumonia). Alveoli were occasionally filled with small numbers of alveolar macrophages and frequently lined by plump, cuboidal epithelial cells, indicating type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, with occasional clubbing of alveolar walls due to mild smooth muscle hypertrophy.",

Though it is difficult to exactly recapitulate natural exposure route and dose, the FFV experimental exposure protocol used in this study is comparable to inoculation doses others have used in experimental FFV inoculation studies, and resulted in viral loads and antibody responses comparable to those recorded in naturally infected animals [6,8,11,42]. In addition to clinical monitoring, assessing viral kinetics and tropism, determining specific antibody response, and a histopathological assessment of different tissues, we conducted assays to expand infection characterization. This included flow cytometric assessment of specific white blood cell subsets suggested to be involved in FFV infection and renal-specific assays to determine the extent of FFV involvement in renal health or disease. Samples analyzed were obtained from control experimental cats reported in a previous study in which an FFV-based vaccine candidate was tested [10]. Based on microscopic findings from the FFV-infected cohort showing evidence of injury in renal tissues during acute FFV infection (Figure 6A and Table 4), we investigated the potential association of FFV with CKD in Australian client-owned cats following natural FFV infection.",

Provirus was primarily isolated from lymphoid tissues including PBMC, the retropharyngeal lymph node, and spleen as previously reported (Table 3) [6,11,27]. The expanded tissue tropism found in cat FFV3, with 10-fold higher PBMC proviral load than the other cats, also included the oral mucosa, suggesting that animals with higher viral loads could have dissemination to non-lymphoid sites. We were unable to detect virus in the tissues of one cat (FFV4) which also tended to have lower PBMC proviral load [10]. Viral RNA was detected once in the saliva of cat FFV4 (Table 2), indicating that limited amounts of virus was being shed, and that salivary excretion may not correlate with widespread tissue distribution. A recently published report by Cavalcante and others on FFV-infected cats in Brazil found that pet and feral cats were more likely to be FFV positive in PBMC than in buccal swabs, as tested by PCR [83]. This has also been reported in primates due to a delay in salivary excretion of virus compared to blood [84]. A wide variability of FV positivity has been shown in different nonhuman primate species and even within the same species [85,86,87]. It is possible that due to the acute time period in our study, viral titer had not yet reached high enough levels in the oral cavity to be detected in the saliva.",

FFV-associated lung lesions have previously been noted in another experimental FFV infection study which reported mixed cellular infiltrates and eosinophilic fluid within alveolar walls [6], similar to findings reported here. Alterations in CNS histopathology of FFV-infected cats suggest viral replication or associated inflammation as is seen in other retroviral infections [88,89,90]. FFV has previously been isolated from the CNS of cats, and may therefore indicate that FFV is capable of productive CNS infection and subtle neurologic alterations [91]. These findings suggest a potential role for FFV in the development of mild acute inflammation in a variety of parenchymal organs and brain. FFV proviral load did not appear to correlate to the presence or severity of histopathology and histopathological changes were observed in tissues that were not FFV PCR positive and vice-versa. The changes observed were mild and consistent with inflammation due to nonspecific immune stimulation, and cannot be unequivocally associated with FFV infection, which would be ideally confirmed by viral propagation from isolated tissues or immunohistochemistry [11]. Nevertheless, the findings of consistent mild inflammation in multiple tissues of SPF cats exposed to FFV suggest that microscopic alterations occur during acute FFV infection.",

If enough podocytes are irreversibly injured, then the patient can develop segmental to global glomerulosclerosis, a disease process in humans and small animals that can cause proteinuria, usually with UPC >2. Although a cut-off for the number of irreversibly injured podocytes has not been established in cats, a model of glomerulosclerosis in rats estimated that >40% of the podocytes have to die and detach in order for glomerulosclerosis to develop [92]. Notably, glomerulosclerosis was not identified in any of the cats in the present study. Tubular atrophy noted on histopathology is an irreversible lesion and often seen in cats with clinical evidence of CKD [62,63]. Overall, our findings indicate subtle reversible renal alterations, indicating that FFV does not induce dramatic changes to renal function within 6 months of infection, however it is unknown how the lesions could have progressed in a chronic infection. We did not detect correlations between proviral PBMC load and presence or severity of TEM changes.",

Similar structures have been found in the central nervous system in both cats and humans. Cook and others described similar tubular structures as \u201cparamyxovirus nucleocapsid-like\u201d in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes taken from demyelinating lesions in the optic nerve of three clinically healthy adult cats [95]. These inclusion-body like structures were of 16\u201317 nm in diameter and fused into penta- to septa-laminar shapes and 900 nm in length. The authors suggested a possible viral etiology. Wilcox and others (1984) reported similar structures in optic nerves and brains of 24 clinically healthy cats from which FFV was isolated [91]. While also finding 10\u201318 nm wide and 500 nm long structures, they also reported structures in much smaller shapes, appearing as \u201cshort, disorganized fragments,\u201d located next to where budding virions were observed, in addition to intranuclearly. These structures were, however, found in the cytoplasm of cells that did not display CPEs and thus these lesions were not attributed to FFV but perhaps a morbillivirus [91].",

            "text": "FFV was highly prevalent in Australian domestic cats as reported previously [16,19], and could be due to the lifestyle of Australian cats which are commonly allowed outside [96,97], allowing more opportunities to interact with other potentially infected cats. The samples analyzed also consisted of sera/plasma assayed by ELISA and whole blood analyzed by PCR. PCR is not as sensitive as ELISA for detection and can yield false negatives [8,10,16,26,72], therefore it is possible that FFV prevalence is even higher in Australia. Similar prevalence rates in males (68%) and females (69%) indicates that there are no sex-related differences in prevalence rates in Australian pet cats [16]. A recent study of feral cats in the USA found an association between FFV infection and male sex [27]. However, our epidemiological results were obtained from client-owned desexed animals. Another epidemiological study of FFV in Australia did not find an association between sex and FFV infection in desexed domestic cats, but did see higher incidences of FFV in female feral cats [16]. Our findings suggest that while overall there appears to be no association between FFV and CKD, CKD in male cats may be associated with FFV infection, though any effect is mild, and evaluation of a much larger cohort is required to assess actual associations. Male sex has not been found to be an overall risk factor for CKD, however males can be overrepresented in certain age groups [98].",

Evaluation of a multitude of hematologic and immunological parameters did not reveal significant host responses to infection. However, our detailed analysis of serum chemical and histopathological changes indicates sub-clinical alterations that could contribute to metabolic or degenerative diseases over time, supporting our hypothesis and work conducted by earlier researchers, and recent reports in humans [1,3,4,6,7,24,30,45,47,51,52,53,54,55,56]. The negative correlation between lymphocyte count and viral load in one cat with higher viral load suggests that a differential susceptibility and potential pathogenicity may exist in some individuals. Studies with larger cohorts of animals with well-characterized disease phenotypes may reveal subtle relationships between FFV and feline health, since the virus is clearly widely distributed in free-ranging cat populations.",
