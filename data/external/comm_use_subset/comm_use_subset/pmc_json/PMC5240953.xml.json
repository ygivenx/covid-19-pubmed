The methodology originally emerged from medical anthropology and the participatory rural appraisal schools of thought, and thus far has mainly been applied in developing countries [3]. In the 1980s, participatory methods were used by veterinarians in community-based livestock projects in Africa and Asia [1]. Later, they continued to further develop and helped enhance the effectiveness of rinderpest surveillance in pastoralist systems in Africa [2]. There has been an increased interest in the participatory approach in recent years and it is considered an emerging field in veterinary epidemiology [3]. However, despite this growth, there is still not a standard definition for PE (http://www.participatoryepidemiology.info).",

For instance, Catley et al. [1] proposed that the term \u2018participatory\u2019 should include the active involvement of the community in the definition of objectives, interpretation of results and development of solutions. Also, in the context of surveillance, Toribio and Rushton [3] suggested that the participatory process involved in PE should empower stakeholders to solve their own problems and become actively involved in the surveillance system. In the last several years, numerous different projects and studies have used participatory methodologies. Catley et al. [1] provided a comprehensive review on the main strengths and weaknesses of PE in the field of animal health; however, there is not yet a systematic compilation of the activities performed. Moreover, some of the issues highlighted in that review may deserve further attention, such as the challenges due to possible conflicts of interest between community priorities and health policy rules, the institutionalisation of PE activities at the international and national level, priorities for further development, or the needed level of community involvement in order to discriminate what activities may be considered PE.",

The following set of key words (in English) was used: (participatory AND (epidemiology OR surveillance OR outbreak OR control) AND animal). For the term animal, an exhaustive list of terminology (326 terms) referring to all major livestock and poultry species was used as described by Beltran-Alcrudo et al. [5]. On top of the most generic names, synonyms and scientific names, the list included additional terms based on expert opinion on the way livestock species of certain age, gender or neutered status are named. The identified livestock groups included bovines, camelids, equid, swine, poultry, rabbits and small ruminants.",

In addition, a more active involvement of the research community was perceived as a way to provide inputs on the limits and strengths of this methodology and was viewed as a way to promote its use. Another route discussed to promote its use was by disseminating (through relevant case studies) the merits of PE among different sectors, such as veterinary services, policy makers, international organizations or farmers. Laboratory diagnosis or further assessment/investigation were also identified as ways to address the need to validate results from PE activities.

Further extensions of this study could include a literature search using other languages. Moreover, part of the literature search was based on peer-reviewed papers and therefore all those studies using PE as a methodology which have not been published or were not included in a technical report, manual, or conference proceeding would not have been identified. In addition, the procedure used to identify past and present projects where PE was used as a methodology was mainly based on replies of the people contacted by email. It could be the case that some did not answer due to time constraints or that relevant practitioners involved in PE projects were not identified. We tried to contact as many individuals as possible; however, we acknowledge that some projects will not have been captured in this review. In the email discussion we had contributions from PE practitioners from different parts of the world, however it has to be taken into account that several PE practitioners might not feel comfortable discussing in English and, therefore, the outcome of the email discussion was clearly biased. In order to simplify the implementation of the discussion, we decided to assume this selection bias; however, it would be a useful exercise to conduct further discussions about the issues raised in this paper at the local level and in the local languages to compile a more complete picture.",

This was also mentioned in the review by Catley et al. [1], where there were doubts about whether some of the included studies would match the proposed \u2018participatory approach\u2019. The opposite may also happen, when papers failed to clearly describe the PE approaches used and, hence, failed to be incorporated into this study. What is and what is not PE seems to be a critical aspect, and despite the previously reported working definitions, as evidenced by the lack of consensus to classify the three provided examples, the critical question of what is and what is not PE might not be clear enough. It is acknowledged that there was not enough data on these examples in order to assess if they could be considered as PE, but despite this fact, the second example that was just an assessment of knowledge, attitudes and practices by using a structured questionnaire, was considered as a PE activity by several based on the assessment of social factors.

This reflection was already elaborated by Toribio and Rushton [3] when deciding whether or not to include PE in the membership examination in epidemiology, asking themselves whether PE could be considered an accepted component of epidemiology practice. As described in that paper, PE is considered a young discipline and some aspects such as a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses, or examples of how participatory methods could be combined with conventional tools to add value to decision making processes might deserve deeper revision. An attempt was made to cover some of these issues during the email discussion. However, despite some weaknesses being mentioned, there was not a deep debate about them. In our opinion, this was influenced by most participants being very keen in promoting the use of PE and therefore placed more emphasis on the positive aspects rather than the negative ones. A greater involvement of the research community in PE activities was suggested during the email discussion to provide inputs on the limits and strengths of this methodology. It was remarkable that a high percentage of the contributors to this discussion worked at research centres or universities, which could suggest that this is currently being developed and new advances within this methodology might be expected in the near future. Contributors also suggested that OIE and FAO should develop international standards, guidelines and manuals for the veterinary authorities in order to apply PE. In this sense, it is worthwhile mentioning that a recent surveillance manual launched by the OIE [11] has included a chapter where PE is described and that there are already quite a large number of manuals and training materials available on the web (S3 File).",

As mentioned by some participants, PE is often assumed by many to be applicable only for developing countries. However, this ideology is unfounded, and in our opinion, PE could be equally useful in developed countries. Indeed, participants provided some examples about PE applications in developed countries, related with the improvement of surveillance in small ruminants or in the process of developing animal health policies. However, these examples were the exception and most referred to Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. Further explorations of PE applications in developed countries might be desirable.",

During the email discussion forum, the need for statistical methodological developments to use for PE results was mentioned several times. In this sense, a limitation could be that more complex analyses would make it difficult to share results with the community, leading to PE becoming a more conventional research tool rather than a participatory approach [1]. In spite of this, there seems to be a methodological avenue of research within the PE field.",

Most of the identified activities were implemented in Africa and Asia, and focused on surveillance, disease survey and prioritization, and disease control. Based on the suggestions provided during the email discussion forum, we proposed some modifications to the working PE definition previously reported by Catley et al. [1]. The need to increase the number of PE trained people, together with some methodological developments, exploring avenues to institutionalize PE, and discussing the application in developed countries were points highlighted during the forum and point to the importance of further developing PE as a useful approach for engaging communities in addressing animal and related public health risks.",
