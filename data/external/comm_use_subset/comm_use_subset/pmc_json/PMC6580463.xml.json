As VRIs can often be mild or asymptomatic and typically go undocumented, individuals may not seek medical care because either the infection is mild or it elicits symptoms not severe enough to warrant contacting a medical professional [10]. Asymptomatic viral shedding in the nasopharynx in asymptomatic populations and immunocompetent hosts is relatively common [11\u201313]. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially play an key role in propagating outbreaks of respiratory diseases if subclinical VRI is transmissible and leads to progression of symptomatic disease [13]. However, the infections reported by the surveillance showed only the symptomatic fraction of the total infected population [14]. The role of asymptomatic infection in respiratory virus transmission is still largely unknown and the rates of asymptomatic shedding are not well studied.",

If children with VRI presented with obvious symptoms (fever, cough), it would be an easy decision for the surgeon or anesthesiologist to delay surgery if appropriate. In cases of children with mild or no symptoms, it becomes very difficult for doctors to make the right decision. A few studies have investigated VRI associated with a limited number of respiratory viruses and have demonstrated an increased length of stay (LOS) and increased postoperative complication rates in pediatric cardiac surgical patients [15, 16]. The data for VRI among the PSPs is not performed systematically recorded and thus detailed etiologic data are lacking. To better estimate the current state of VRI in PSPs and to improve clinical management, this study aims to investigate the incidence of VRI in the mild symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric surgery population after surgical procedures and to evaluate the impact of VRI on postoperative outcomes. We analyzed detailed symptom data using a standardized symptom survey and quantitative viral load using multiple qRT-PCR to determine the associations between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity.",

Children (age < 18 year) undergoing a surgical procedure between March 2017 and February 2019 were eligible for enrollment. We obtained induced sputum specimens from hospitalized patients within 48 h of admission regardless of the presence of respiratory symptoms, as part of standard care in the hospital. If pediatric patients had serious symptoms suggestive of respiratory infections before surgery and must delay surgery, these patients were excluded from analysis. The PSPs who had no respiratory symptom prior to elective or emergency surgery were included in the study. After surgery, study subjects completed a baseline information form and a standardized symptom survey that included six symptoms (fever [17], wheezing, sputum, shortness of breath, soar throat and cough) and radiographic findings (alveolar or interstitial infiltrate and pleural effusion). Fever was defined as a body temperature \u2265 38.0 \u00b0C. Mild symptoms refer to the subjects who had at least one of the above respiratory symptoms that were not severe. A clinical chart review was performed for subjects to determine whether symptoms occurred outside of the study visit. Data on management and outcome of the cases were collected from the medical records. The study was approved by the institutional ethics review board at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Zhejiang, including a waiver of informed consent.",

A single virus was detected in 141 PSPs (8.66%), and 30 PSPs (1.84%) had multiple viruses identified, which was involved with 63 respiratory viruses. The most commonly identified viruses were HRV/EV (81,42.19%), followed by PIV3 (47, 24.48%), RSV (19, 9.90%), CoV OC43 (13, 6.77%), IV (10, 5.2%), HboV (8, 4.17%), and CoV HKU1 (8, 4.17%) (Table 2). HRV/EV showed the highest rate of infection among respiratory viruses and accounted for 25(12.25%) detected co-infections. The most commonly detected co-infections were HRV/EV and PIV3 (15,7.35%). CoV 229E and PIV4 were not detected in the PSPs. Figure 2 demonstrates the incidence and type of pathogen according to months of the year. Detection of PIV3 increased during the spring and summer and HRV was detected year-round, whereas other viruses were observed with no clear seasonal distribution.",

The following viruses were further investigated to explore the association between symptoms and viral infections: HRV/EV(n = 81), RSV (n = 19), PIV3 (n = 47), IV (n = 10), and CoV (OC43, HKU1, n = 21). These viruses were detected in both asymptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms (Table 2). Other viruses were not analyzed because of small numbers of positivity. Overall, CoV and HRV/EV were associated with lower proportion of symptoms and PIV3, IV and RSV were associated with higher proportion of symptoms (Fig. 3). RSV-positive surgical patients had more respiratory symptoms than other viruses had, though RSV was also identified in 3 patients without symptom. The proportion of symptoms presenting in the PSPs were lower in samples that tested positive for PIV3 than for IV, probably because of the inclusion of some asymptomatic patients with 29 of PIV3 infection. However, alveolar or interstitial infiltration was most frequently observed in PIV 3-positive patients. The proportion of symptoms was lower for CoV infection than other viruses due to the presence of asymptomatic patients with 11 of CoV infection. A lower proportion of symptoms but higher rate of radiographic findings (alveolar or interstitial infiltration and pleural effusion) were found in HRV/EV-positive patients, though 70 of HRV/EV infections were identified in asymptomatic patients.",

In previous studies, the significance of VIR in postoperative recovery patients was questioned, as previous studies reported low positive PCR results for common respiratory viruses in 4.2 and 1.7% of pediatric cardiac surgical patients [15, 16]. These reported studies were limited to RSV, HRV/EV, and IV, possibly missing the other majority of respiratory viruses. In addition, these studies lacked quantitative analysis of viral pathogens in the PSPs. Though the frequency of symptomatic VRI was low, presence of VRI significantly prolonged postoperative recovery in children following surgery, as evidenced by longer LOS periods in hospitalization. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the infection rates and outcomes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic PSPs leading to VRI after surgery using qRT-PCR. As samples were taken not only from patients with symptoms of infection, but also from asymptomatic patients in this study, we were therefore able to explore the impact of viral testing in asymptomatic patients, which could help improve estimates of VRI in PSPs and further study of disease transmission modeling and forecasting.",

This might be owing to the high sensitivity of the proposed qRT-PCR assays identifying more viral pathogens. In this study, we also observed that HRV/EV were associated with prolonged shedding and the most commonly found coinfections were PIV3 and HRV/EV. These results are consistent with previous findings that HRV/EV co-infection or different HRV species co-infection were associated with acute respiratory illness hospitalization and that prolonged viral shedding over the course of 30 days was more commonly associated with respiratory viruses [9, 20\u201323].

Additionally, PIV3 infections were also found in 29 patients with no symptoms, this result is different from a previous study in which many viruses (ADV, IV, RSV, HMPV, COV and HRV/EV) but no PIV was identified in hospitalized children without symptoms of respiratory viral illness [11]. Our findings suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. The PIV3-infected PSPs with mild symptoms or without obviously clinical respiratory symptoms should strictly adhere to the VRI isolation procedures when undergoing elective surgery.
