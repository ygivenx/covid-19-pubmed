Unplanned urban expansion leads to high densities of humans exposed to the mosquito vector Ae. aegypti [3]. It also puts severe constraints on civic amenities, particularly water supply and solid waste disposal, thereby increasing the breeding potential of the vector species [4, 9]. Water that is left stored in the open can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry dengue fever [19]. Risk factors associated with dengue also include lacking mosquito control infrastructure and dengue vector control services [20]. In addition, increased air travel and globalization of trade significantly contributed to the introduction of all dengue virus serotypes to most population centers of the world. Globalization and travel have also contributed to hyperendemic transmission of all four dengue serotypes throughout the tropics [21].",

(2014) explored the relationship between temperature, precipitation, and dengue incidence [25, 48, 50]. Johansson et al. (2009) found a positive association between short-term interannual (monthly) variations in temperature, precipitation, and dengue incidence [25]. This positive association varied spatially and was associated with differences in local climate. For example, the effect of temperature on dengue incidence was highest in Puerto Rico's cool and wet mountainous area, while the effect of precipitation was greatest in the hot and dry southwestern coastal region. Likewise, M\u00e9ndez-L\u00e1zaro et al. (2014) found that dengue transmission increased by a factor of 3.4 for each 1\u00b0C increase in sea surface temperature. In contrast, Jury (2008) found that monthly increases in dengue cases were driven by rainfall (May to November) while intra-annual variability in dengue cases related positively to temperature. Jury also found that the incidence of dengue had been relatively constant over time, despite global warming, which was possibly due to declining rainfall after 1998, improving health care and small changes in population size. He also found a weak association between year-to-year variability in dengue cases and local rainfall and an Index of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [48]. Keating (2001) considered the relationship between temperature and dengue incidence. Keating (2001) found a positive association between short-term interannual (monthly) variations in temperature and dengue incidence (as the temperature increases so does the number of dengue cases reported each month in Puerto Rico) [49].",

Another study predicted that declining rainfall, improving health care, and limited population growth offset adverse effects of global warming [48]. A consideration of the potential mediating or constraining influence of nonclimatic factors of dengue transmission (socioeconomic factors) by Johansson et al.

This study confirmed that Ae. aegypti is well adapted to the environments of crowded tropical cities and to a variety of terrestrial environments with or without tree coverage and associated with humans [7]. Another study examined the effect of housing distribution and patterns on Ae. aegypti dispersal in rural communities and found that in rural habitats Ae. aegypti do not disperse far from their development sites and tend to be spatially clustered at the household level [47].",

It is important to note that this study was the first study of aquatic habitats producing dengue vectors anywhere in the Caribbean region or in Central and South America; the findings were unexpected because Ae. aegypti had been regarded as a \u201cclean water\u201d mosquito.

Of the articles discussing environmental factors, three considered entomologic surveillance and dengue vector control measures [58\u201360]. As mentioned earlier, pupal production is an indicator of vector abundance and density (vector density is the number of pupae per person). When vector density is considered high (all things being equal), the likelihood of an epidemic increases. Barrera et al. [59] found that sequential sampling provided substantial reductions in the sample size required to determine if vector density falls above or below a given threshold. For example, he found that, after sampling only 25 premises in the first survey and 125 in the second survey, it was possible to determine that pupae densities were above the dengue epidemic threshold (female pupae/person of 0.19) [59]. That study also examined the use of predictive computer models for validating threshold limits for epidemic risk in a particular locale [59]. He confirmed that simplified pupal surveys of Ae. aegypti (using sequential sampling programs) are an efficient method for validating entomological dengue transmission thresholds indicating when transmission might occur and thus forecasting epidemics [47]. Entomologic thresholds were based on mosquito simulation model and a dengue simulation model [59]. One study found that cost effective larval control programs are less than US$ 2.50 per person and reduce dengue transmission by 50%. Larval control programs in conjunction with an early warning system that provides information on possible outbreak of dengue are cost effective if below US$ 4.50 per person [60] (see Table 3).",

Two studies evaluated the island's laboratory-based, enhanced dengue surveillance system (EDSS), which was developed by the CDC and first implemented in Puerto Rico in 2005 [63, 66]. Ramos et al. (2008) concluded that the island's enhanced surveillance system allowed for a more accurate, population-based estimate of dengue incidence and severity [64]. She also found that simplified case definitions for DHF based on WHO criteria might be useful for clinic-based surveillance. In addition, she postulated that early identification of dengue cases could be useful in reducing virus transmission in dengue endemic communities. Both Rigau-P\u00e9rez and Ramos stressed the importance of virologic surveillance in confirming the accuracy of dengue diagnosis [64, 66] (see Table 3).",

Two examined the impact of dengue intervention and control methods on dengue incidence [61, 65]. Winch et al. established that a pilot child-focused community program conducted in Puerto Rico in 1995 showed significant positive impact on knowledge and behavior related to dengue prevention [65]. For example, he identified that exposure to an exhibit on Ae. aegypti at the Children's Museum in San Juan and to elementary and preschool education programs was associated with significantly higher levels of correct dengue-related knowledge among children. He also ascertained a statistically significant increase in the proportion of protected tires with increasing parent-child communication about dengue [65]. Clark et al. confirmed that a child-focused social mobilization and communication program raised awareness and generated some behavior change [61]. Both authors reported that the pilot program had limited impact of larval indices [61, 65].",

The author identified several barriers to sustained dengue prevention: (1) misconceptions about dengue from outdated educational material; (2) the \u201cinvisibility\u201d of dengue as compared to the importance of chronic diseases; (3) a lack of acceptance of responsibility for dengue prevention [17, 56]. P\u00e9rez-Guerra et al. also identified differences in KAP by gender, which were consistent with the cultural values and social norms in Puerto Rico. For example, women considered dengue important because of the burden and impact on society, while men thought it was a serious disease because of an individual's lack of perceived health risk [17]. One article inquired about the relationship between dengue education and personal protective measures against mosquitoes [62]. O'Leary et al. determined that pretravel educational messages contributed to protective behavior in travelers to endemic areas [62].",

Johansson also considered the potential mediating or constraining influence of socioeconomic factors of dengue transmission (population density, median household income, and the percentage of families living below the poverty line). He found that the association between weather variables and dengue incidence was stronger in areas with a higher poverty index [25]. And he also inferred that factors other than climate related to the history of herd immunity, the introduction of a new serotype, or demographic transitions are also influencing the cyclical transmission of dengue fever [49]. Jury (2008) reported that declining rainfall, improving health care, and limited population growth might offset adverse effects of global warming [48].",

Several key findings have implications for Zika emergence and control. First, increases in temperature and rainfall were associated with increased vector density and ultimately dengue transmission across Puerto Rico [25, 48]. Seasonal rainfall enhances mosquito breeding and therefore vector abundance in areas where outdoor rain-filled surface containers are being used [58] and discarded containers, those used for animal drinking, ornamental purposes, and household cleaning filled with standing water were the most common oviposition sites. Ae. aegypti is the main vector for Zika virus and it is likely that a similar seasonal pattern to dengue will be observed for Zika in PR.",

Several emerging diseases have faced the same communication problems including Ebola, MERS-CoV, and now Zika. Health communication campaigns are often poorly resourced, rarely engage health communication experts from the affected area, and seldom benefit from meaningful evaluation. Despite this, community-based interventions remain to be critical to achieve long-term vector control through behavior change [61, 65] and public health interventions should address existing barriers to behavior which are deeply entrenched in the local culture's belief about health as well as gender roles and promote the integration of community groups and community leaders into current dengue prevention and control programs [17, 56].",

Changes in ecological factors, such as the vector utilizing alternative habitats such as septic tanks, and changes in human land use (urbanization) and vegetation provide new oviposition sites and feeding opportunities, allowing the vector to survive and increase its transmission potential. Social and cultural factors such as disease surveillance, community knowledge and behaviors (KAP), and social organization (gender role behaviors) play an important role in affecting vector control. These and other extrinsic factors do not act in isolation, but rather affect dengue transmission directly, indirectly, and in combination. Future research needs to further refine models in dengue transmission and include additional extrinsic factors such as demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic in order to understand further how they affect dengue transmission on a local level and over time. The problem of dengue, and now of Zika, transmission can change only if the vector can be controlled. However, for Puerto Rico, and in the context of global warming and increasing population growth and diversity, extrinsic factors are likely to remain influential well into the future.",
