Following its discovery, many cases were identified in different regions of the Arabian Peninsula and worldwide thereafter [2,3]. The most recent outbreak occurred in June 2015 in South Korea and was linked to a South Korean man who had recently traveled to the Middle East [3]. The infection then rapidly spread to 26 persons through close contact in a hospital. Within a few months, many cases (n=186) were reported in hospitalized and non-hospitalized persons in South Korea [3]. The disease showed a high mortality rate that reached up to 40%, which was higher than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002-2003 (10%) [4].",

Five human coronaviruses were identified (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, and SARS-CoV) before MERS-CoV. Lineage C of betacoronaviruses includes bat coronaviruses, which give a primitive impression regarding the origin of the virus [6]. The detection of MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies in the sera of dromedary camels has shed light on the role of the camel as a possible animal reservoir, which may transmit the virus to humans [7-10]. Indeed, researchers isolated the same MERS-CoV strain from both a camel \u201cin a barn\u201d and its infected owner in Saudi Arabia, thus providing further evidence of the potential airborne and direct contact transmission of the virus between camels and humans [11].",

            "text": "There have been several attempts to develop a protective vaccine against MERS-CoV [12-23]. Researchers around the world are focused on the spike protein as the main target for vaccine development against MERS-CoV. The spike protein of MERS-CoV attaches to the host dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptor, which is expressed on several types of human cells [24]. Many studies published since 2012 suggesting vaccine models were constructed based on the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) region to elicit a strong and protective immune response in vitro and in vivo [25]. Recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines are one of the most effective vaccines and showed interesting results during SARS-CoV outbreaks [12,26,27]. Since 2013, several studies were published, in which different viral vectors (e.g., adenoviruses and vaccinia virus) were used to develop recombinant vaccine candidates based on full spike gene or part of it and tested their ability to produce protective immunity against MERS-CoV infection [13-23]. However, further investigations are needed on these suggested vaccines including testing their ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies in different animal models, stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses and their corresponding cytokine and chemokine profiles, distribution within the host, and their safety and duration profiles.",

Cells from each group (1\u00d7105) were re-suspended in 1 ml of complete RPMI and plated in 24-well plates in triplicate in parallel, adjacent wells. The first set of samples was stimulated with 10 \u00b5g of specific peptide \u201cepitope\u201d CYSSLILDY per well. This antigen was defined as the highest potential T-cell epitope from a total of eight potential epitopes within the RBD region of the S1 subunit of the spike protein of MERS-CoV genome and was expected to display interactions with the maximum number of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I molecules, and to show the highest peak in the B-cell antigenicity plot [33]. The second set of samples was stimulated with 50 \u00b5g of non-specific stimulant phytohemagglutinin to confirm the viability and productivity of the cultured cells. The third set of samples was not stimulated as a control set. Cells were incubated in round-bottom 24-well microtiter plates at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. The cultured media were collected after 96 h, and the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatants were stored at \u221220\u00b0C before cytokine analysis, while the pellets were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until real-time (RT)-PCR analysis.",

The results of these studies were encouraging and showed that such vaccines may be promising to prevent the global threat of MERS-CoV infection [13,14,17,19-23]. However, the safety and efficacy of these vaccines still to be confirmed. It was confirmed that the S protein is responsible for the production of neutralizing antibodies [22,31]. The S1 subunit contains the RBD, which binds to its host receptor DPP4 (also known as CD26) and induces production of specific neutralizing antibodies. Several studies have supported the role of this domain to elicit protective immunity against MERS-CoV challenge [25,36,37].",

These findings support the ability of this vaccine candidate to distribute effectively within host tissues and express the target protein. It has been established that DPP4 is expressed on multiple cell types in the human body including cells in the kidneys and lungs [24]. However, the N glycoprotein, but not the S glycoprotein, of MERS was the target of investigation of MERS-CoV localization using IHC [38]. The N glycoprotein was clearly present in lung tissues following MERS exposure. In fact, the current study can be considered pioneering given the use of the S1 glycoprotein to express viral distribution in tissues. Therefore, the expression of S1 protein in kidney tissues and not in lung might be used to explain previous in vitro experiments, which found a cytopathic effect of the MERS-CoV infection inside primary human kidney cells but not in primary human bronchial epithelial cells [39]. In a recent study, the adenoviral vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein but not the adenoviral vector with MERS in a hDPP4 mice experiment after intramuscular or intranasal injection [21]. This supporting our finding that this construct was able to reach the lung tissues, but the S1 protein was not expressed in lung tissues. However, S1 gene detection in lung tissues by conventional PCR and not by IHC indicates further investigation is necessary regarding the level and intensity of S1 expression in this tissue. Additional studies are also needed to explore S1 protein expression in other tissues such as the liver and intestine given the expression of DPP4 in these tissues [40].",

Many pathogens, especially viruses, shift the host immune response toward Th2 dominance over the Th1 response to evade cellular immunity. In this study, Ad-MERS-S1 was able to provoke pro-inflammatory but not anti-inflammatory cytokine release. Both Th1 and Th2 responses were elicited following immunization. Cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, which represent the Th-1 response, were upregulated, while IL-4, which represents the Th-2 response, was downregulated.",

A similar increase in IL-12 was apparent in vaccinated animals in response to specific in vitro antigen stimulation. The mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b3 was detected as early as 4 weeks after the first immunization. In contrast, IL-4 production in cell culture showed a significant increase in control animals after antigen stimulation, while the production of this cytokine was significantly decreased in the vaccinated group. The results demonstrated neither positive nor negative impact on IL-4 expression in mice vaccinated with the Ad-MERS-S1 or mice that received only PBS. Interestingly, there was a significant increase in IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 gene expression in antigen-stimulated cell culture obtained from mice vaccinated with Ad-CMV at week 6. This might be due to the ability of adenoviruses to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses [42,43]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of the S1 protein gene in the adenovirus vector genome disturbs the immune stimulation ability of the adenovirus vector to elicit IL-4 cytokine.",

The truncated RBD fused with the Fc portion of human IgG was able to elicit both isotypes with a relatively higher amount of the IgG2a isotype (Th1 response) [44]. Recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the S1 subunit or the whole S gene was also able to induce both types of the immune response. The IgG2a level was detected earlier and higher in MERS-S than MERS-S1 at week 2 post-vaccination but not after week 3 [14].

In vitro, antigen-specific stimulation resulted in a significant upregulation of IL-12 production when compared with the antigen-stimulated and non-stimulated cell culture in the vaccinated group only. In vitro stimulation using the MERS-specific peptide \u201cCYSSLILDY\u201d resulted in a significant upregulation of IL-4 production in the control groups while the same antigen stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in IL-4 production in the vaccinated group.
