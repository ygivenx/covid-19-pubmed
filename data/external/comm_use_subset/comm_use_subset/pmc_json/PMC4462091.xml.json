            "text": "The principle of the proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of the signal transducer, CHA amplification and DNAzyme signal readout steps. The target T0 (in red) is the part of lytA gene of S. pneumoniae. Domain b and c of the hairpin H0 (in blue), have been designed according to the sequences of H1, serve as a toehold for initiating the amplification reaction. The signal transducer H0 is generated by extending the 3\u2019-end of domain b and c to form a hairpin loop where domain b* of H0 is occluded by domain b. Therefore H0 should be catalytically inactive. The loop a* is the complementary sequence to 24 nt of lytA gene nucleic acid. A pair of hairpins was designed based on our previous research works28. The two hairpins (H1 and H2) do not initially interact with each other but can catalytically form a duplex in the presence of unstructured domain b and c. The unstructured domain e and f of H1 are able to form G-quadruplex. When domain e is hidden in the stem of H1, the G-quadruplex cannot be formed at this time. In the presence of target, the loop can hybridize with the target, forming a rigid duplex and disrupting the stem formed by domain b*and b. The liberated b and c further open H1, leading to the formation of toehold for strand displacement by H2. Then H2 hybridizes with the unfolded H1 and releases the complex of T0 and H0 (T0-H0) into next circulation. As a result, the generated abundant G-quadruplex structures are proportional to targets. The G-quadruplex structure can strongly bind with hemin to form the DNAzyme, displaying peroxidase-like activity, catalyzing oxidation of ABTS2\u2212 to ABTS\u2212.",

After incubation with hemin for 40 min, the absorbance of different mixtures was recorded. As shown in Fig. 2A, the system containing H1 exhibited very weak characteristic absorption peak at 418 nm (Fig. 2A, curve a). Compared with curve a, there was almost no change in the mixture of H1 and H2 (Fig. 2A, curve b). Upon the addition of H0 to the H1, H2 system, a slight increase in absorption peak was detected (Fig. 2A, curve c). The results demonstrated that H0 can trigger weak interaction of H1 and H2 to form a small amount of self-assembly product, resulting in background signal. When the mixture of 500 pM T0, H0 and H1 was incubated together, the absorbance increased slightly (Fig. 2A, curve d), indicating that T0 can trigger the self-assembly of H0 and H1, forming a certain amount of G-quadruplex structures. But in the presence of T0 and H2 (Fig. 2A, curve e), the amplified signal was about 282% of that without H2 (Fig. 2A, curve d). Such significant signal enhancement clearly indicates that the cycling amplification strategy can be executed with the aid of hairpin H2. The insets of Fig. 2A show the corresponding photographs of the colorimetric responses.",

When we mixed the H0, H1 and H2, there was a barely visual band (lane 7) above H0, H1 and H2, which was H1-H2 complex.

First, the effect of concentration of hairpin H0 and H1 were investigated respectively. High concentration of hairpin structures can increase the self-assembly, but correspondingly increase the noise owing to the potential hybridization of hairpins. To avoid the signal increase induced by nonspecific background amplification, the signal-to-noise ratio is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the assay. The maximum value of signal-to-noise ratio was achieved at the H0 concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 3A). The concentration of H1 was also critical parameter affecting the analytical performance. As showed in Fig. 3B, 125 nM H1 was chosen for the subsequent experiments according to the maximum signal-to-noise ratio.",

The continuously increasing signal also indicated that the T0-H0 catalyzed hairpin assembly was indeed taking place. Beyond the incubation time of 20 min, the absorbance intensity reached a stable value. Therefore, 20 min was selected as the optimal incubation time for CHA. Finally, the incubating temperature was examined from 4 to 55 \u00b0C (Fig. 3D). At 37 \u00b0C, the signal-to-noise ratio reached the top, so 37 \u00b0C was selected as the appropriate temperature.",

As shown in Fig. 5A, the absorbance for one-base mismatched DNA and two bases mismatched DNA was only about 25.8% and 4.0% of that for perfect target, respectively. The non-complementary target DNA showed almost the same response as the blank solution, indicating high specificity and great potential for single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. This may be attributed to the relatively long stem region of the hairpin structure with thermodynamic stability. In addition, the specificity of the developed method was further explored using other streptococci and major pathogenic bacteria presented in clinical samples. As shown in Fig. 5B, S. pneumoniae and other bacteria at two different concentration levels (107 and 108 CFU mL\u22121) were analyzed.

            "text": "In principle, non-nucleic acid can also be employed as inputs. Previous studies2430 have shown that the aptamer can be used in conjugation with catalyzed hairpin assembly for the detection of non-nucleic-acid analytes. Therefore, based on the developed colorimetric strategy, Salmonella Typhimurium has been successfully detected using transducer with the similar circuit\u2019s module. The principle of detecting Salmonella Typhimurium is illustrated in Fig. 6A. We design an aptamer beacon in which an anti-Salmonella Typhimurium aptamer27, Apt, is inhibited by a complementary strand, Inh. Apt contains the toehold (domain b and c) for initiating the amplification reaction, and Inh can block the catalyst region. When Apt is bound with Inh, it can neither bind Salmonella Typhimurium nor catalyze the hybridization of H1 and H2. In contrast, free Apt can do both. As a result, when the Salmonella Typhimurium binds to and stabilizes Apt, it shifts the equilibrium so that the duplex with Inh is destabilized and the single-stranded toehold is available to activate the amplification reaction. As shown in Fig. 6B, the cultured three Salmonella Typhimurium were inoculated into PBS with different concentrations from 0 to 8 \u00d7 107 CFU mL\u22121 (with 1:4 dilution), respectively. Upon addition of Salmonella Typhimurium with increasing concentration, the intensity of absorbance increased successively. The RSD of the intra-assay and inter-assay precisions were 5.0% and 7.6%, respectively. The results indicate that the developed method possesses the potential as a pragmatic tool for Salmonella Typhimurium direct detection in real samples. Furthermore, the amplification strategy can be used for detection different targets by means of changing the corresponding complementary target DNA or aptamer strands, demonstrating versatile and potential colorimetric sensing platform.",

This strategy has been successfully used for detection of oligonucleotide and Salmonella Typhimurium. It can conveniently be extended to a wide range of analytes with available affinity ligands. This developed method shows excellent analytical performance with satisfactory versatility for different analytes. In addition, the proposed strategy possesses good reproducibility and acceptable accuracy for clinical practical sample analysis, and provides a label-free, enzyme-free, low-cost, visual, simple, rapid, sensitive and specific platform for clinical diagnostics.",
