The highest herd-prevalences (90 to 100%) were found in the southern parts of the country.

A circle/ellipse is considered a cluster if the Relative Risk is significantly higher or lower than one, when significance was tested using Monte-Carlo simulation. In this study, Poisson models applying both different cluster shapes (circular and elliptic) and sizes (maximum cluster sizes of 50, 20 and 10% of the total population at risk) were built to identify both high-risk and low-risk clusters.

Because a few individuals were sampled from each herd (one or two in 95% of herds in the study sample) the herd sensitivity was here low. As a consequence, it can be assumed that a proportion of infected herds and of infected individuals within these herds could have been missed (as both viruses are highly contagious within herd), thus decreasing the apparent individual-level prevalences. This study was not predominately designed to estimate the seroprevalences of BCV and BRSV infections in Sweden, but to explore their spatial distribution.",

In addition, the area with the lowest prevalence for BRSV has a very low beef herd density (2 per 100 km2). This suggests a positive association between herd-density and risk of infection. Statistical analysis confirmed that areas with herd-density >10 per 100 km2 had significantly higher risk of being part of high-prevalence clusters. A probable explanation is that a short distance between herds increases the risk of spread of the viruses. In such situations, there is a higher likelihood of direct and indirect contact (through e.g. animals, vehicles or visitors) between herds and animals. However, some PCAs in the low-prevalence cluster Kronoberg-Blekinge also had a beef herd-density >10 per 100 km2, suggesting that there are other factors with uneven geographic distribution that have an impact on the BCV and BRSV prevalences. Live animal trade, in particular, is considered very important for the spread of infectious diseases and a recent study show that the number of movements and trade patterns in different parts of Sweden vary considerably [28].",

The size of Swedish beef herds differs between regions and there is a tendency for smaller herd sizes in the regions covering the identified low prevalence areas compared to the high prevalence areas (10 beef adults per herd in Kronoberg-Blekinge versus 16 in Sk\u00e5ne, based on information from the database of the Swedish Board of Agriculture). Also regional differences in biosecurity and management routines in relation to farming styles can be assumed. Based on a study on Swedish dairy farms, it has been suggested that organic herds may have a reduced risk of BCV and BRSV infections, when compared to conventional herds [30]. To quantify the relative impact of potential risk factors for a herd to be detected as BCV or BRSV-infected (e.g. trade intensity, density of dairy herds, herd size, biosecurity measures, type and number of visitors), studies could be conducted by comparing herd characteristics and management practices in the low and high-risk areas identified. The results of such studies would enlighten the choice of relevant strategies to control BCV and BRSV infections not only in Sweden, but also in other areas where herds have to some extent similar characteristics.",
