            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects 0.5 to 1% the world population [1]. RA is typically characterized by symmetric polyarthritis involving the extremities with erosive joint changes mediated by hyperplastic synovium (pannus) and chronic inflammation [1]. Disease severity is associated with elevated production of inflammatory cytokines and activities of tissue degrading proteases [1]. While the etiology of RA is incompletely understood, studies in rodent RA models have provided major insights into the pathophysiology of RA including the discovery of dysregulation of cytokine signaling networks, providing bases for the development of new treatments. Central roles of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [2, 3] have provided rationale for therapies targeting these arthritogenic cytokines. While these and other interventions have greatly improved disease control and the quality of life of RA patients, the majority of patients achieve moderate and incomplete disease control, and remission is achieved in only 10\u201315% of patients [4]. Side effects of approved RA therapeutics have limited their use in a number of patient populations [5]. Thus, new and more efficacious therapies are needed for RA and major efforts are underway to identify and develop novel treatment strategies.",

They are the only known cyclic polypeptides in animals, and their conformation confers remarkable stability in vitro and in vivo [9, 10].

The peptide was highly effective in reducing lethality in mice with experimental severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [14] and in murine models of E. coli and polymicrobial sepsis [9]. Therapeutic effects of RTD-1 were mediated, at least in part, by modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vitro studies revealed that RTDs suppress expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 [9, 14] by TLR agonist-stimulated leukocytes, and the anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by regulation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways [15]. These studies suggest that \u03b8-defensins are pleiotropic peptides that evolved to neutralize pathogens and modulate inflammation. To further test this concept, we evaluated the effect of RTD-1 on the course of pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in DA rats, a model of autoimmune arthritis that shares many features of human RA [16]. Based on the finding that RTD-1 was effective in dose-dependently suppressing and resolving PIA, we conducted studies to identify mechanisms that may mediate the therapeutic efficacy observed.",

Animals were monitored daily and disease severity of each limb was scored 0\u20134 using the method of Brand et al. [18]. The severity scores for all limbs of individual animals were totaled to give an individual\u2019s arthritis severity score (AS) ranging from zero for normal animals to maximum disease score of sixteen. Disease severity was assessed by at least two scorers and the inter-rater agreement (kappa) value was 0.806 as determined using MedCalc Statistical Software version 14.8.1 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). In three separate trials, treatment was also blinded to scorers. There was no statistical difference between blinded and unblinded scoring of any treatment cohort. Treatment with saline (vehicle), RTD-1, or anti-arthritic agents was randomized and initiated when an animal first presented with an AS of 3 or more. RTD-1 was administered subcutaneously with doses ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 mg/kg in an injection volume of 0.5 ml at intervals ranging from once a day (qd) to once every seven days (q7d). MTX was administered at 0.25 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection q3d [19]. Etanercept was administered at 0.4 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection q3d [20, 21].",

We therefore analyzed the effect of RTD-1 administration on joint levels of IL-1\u03b2 in PIA rats. Consistent with other studies, IL-1\u03b2 was not detectable in joints of na\u00efve rats, but levels were markedly elevated in diseased joints of PIA rats and joint IL-1\u03b2 levels correlated with arthritis severity score of the corresponding limb (Pearson r = 0.4923, P = 0.0013; Fig 6A). PIA rats with established disease (AS \u2265 3) were treated s.c. once a day for four days with 5 mg/kg RTD-1 or vehicle after which joint tissue from euthanized animals was analyzed for IL-1\u03b2. Peptide treatment reduced joint IL-1\u03b2 by an average of 44% (P = 0.0054, Fig 6B), which coincided with the marked reduction in arthritis severity in RTD-1 treated animals after 4 days of treatment (P = 0.0044; Fig 2A).",

Previous studies disclosed that RTD-1 modulates inflammatory cytokine expression in rodent infectious disease models [9, 14] and in immune-stimulated human leukocytes [9, 15]. In those studies, arthritogenic cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) were among those down-regulated by RTD-1. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that RTD-1 would alter the course of disease in a rodent model of RA wherein disease onset and progression are driven by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. The studies reported here employed rat PIA since this T-cell dependent disease model mimics human RA, including symmetrical involvement of peripheral joints, destruction of cartilage and bone, dysregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, rheumatoid factor positivity, and its chronic course. PIA is dependent on MHC class II-restricted T-cells [26] and influenced by non-MHC genes, producing cellular and humoral autoimmunity [16, 25, 41]. Non-MHC genes that influence rat PIA arthritis severity include TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 [42], IL-6, IL-17 [43], and CCL-2, and joint damaging MMPs [25, 44]. Rat PIA is increasingly utilized as a model for preclinical evaluation of human RA drug candidates [16].",

Therapeutic effects were rapid, and dose level and dose interval dependent. RTD-1 induced disease resolution more effectively than a TNF\u03b1 inhibitor or MTX, and at rates exceeding that reported using a mouse anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody [45], or the < 10% remission rate observed in treated RA patients [46]. Moreover, arrest of disease progression and resolution of arthritis was obtained with RTD-1 treatment in early and in severe stages of PIA, and therapeutic responses correlated with marked reductions in limb swelling, and recovery of limb function and mobility. In our studies on the effect of RTD-1 on evolving disease, resolution of clinical arthritis corresponded to histologic joint morphology which disclosed that treated animals had essentially normal joint structures whereas those from control animals showed severe pannus formation, chronic inflammation, and erosion (Fig 2C and S1 Fig). In this study, we did not perform histologic evaluation of joints from RTD-1 treated animals with maximum established disease (Fig 3A). Of note, peptide treatment of severely arthritic animals induced a higher frequency of complete clinical resolution (Fig 3A; S2 Video) than occurred with treatment of animals with evolving disease (Fig 2B), and this may be of translational significance since treatment of RA is usually initiated once disease is well established. We hypothesize that this somewhat paradoxical finding reflects pleiotropic anti-arthritic RTD-1 mechanisms which differentially affect the pathophysiology of evolving and established severe disease. Studies are underway to identify pathologic and/or resolution-promoting processes modulated by RTD-1 at different stages of PIA. Evaluation of the effect of RTD-1 in another animal model of RA, such as collagen induced arthritis, is likely to provide additional insights into anti-arthritic mechanisms mediated by \u03b8-defensins.",

For example, down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine expression has been shown to occur at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, the former revealed in studies on THP-1 macrophages wherein RTD-1 was shown to down-regulate MAP kinases and NF-\u0138B activation, inhibiting transcription of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, CCL-3, and CCL-4 [15]. Post-translational regulation of arthritogenic mediators is exemplified by the rapid and potent inhibition of ADAM17 by RTD-1 which blocks TNF\u03b1 release [39]. Consistent with this effect, RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats suppressed expression of joint IL-1\u03b2, a central mediator of arthritis which is upregulated by TNF\u03b1 [35, 47]. RTD-1 also acts directly on FLS to reduce the production of IL-6 and reduces cell invasiveness, two processes involved in joint damage. Studies are underway to further delineate the pathways that mediate RTD-1 modulation of other inflammatory/arthritogenic cytokine networks implicated in RA.",

The inhibitory potency of RTD-1 against a panel of MMPs and cathepsins varies substantially, but plasma levels (Cmax) achieved following s.c. treatment approximate or exceed the IC50s of ADAM17 and cathepsin K, potentially providing a rapid mechanism for regulating these arthritogenic proteases, in the former case down-regulating local TNF\u03b1 levels and downstream effects (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MMP expression).

RTD-1 itself is a pharmaceutical candidate as this naturally occurring molecule is well tolerated when administered subcutaneously (this study and ref. [9]), and by intravenous, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal routes (our unpublished results). RTD-1 was non-immunogenic (Fig 5), circumventing the development of neutralizing antibodies, a problem encountered by a subset of patients in response to biologic therapeutics [50]. Further, RTD-1 is highly stable in biological matrices [9], has an unusually long terminal half-life allowing for infrequent dosing (Fig 4), and shows no evidence of being immuno-compromising [9, 14]. The concept of using a nonhuman primate peptide represents a novel retroevolutionary therapeutic paradigm whereby products of genes expressed in Old World monkeys may be used to treat a human autoimmune disorder.",
