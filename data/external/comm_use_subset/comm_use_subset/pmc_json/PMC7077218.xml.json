With each new outbreak, lives are lost, and the world is placed on high alert. Lessons have been learned from the initial coverup and misidentification of the SARS pathogen in 2003 [5,6], and the recent slow response of the World Health Organization to the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak [7]. From this perspective, it is understandable that Chinese scientists cautiously released the identity and genome sequence of this new virus [3]. However, transparency on disease reporting to the public and data sharing with international colleagues must continue. With an increasing number of new cases of infection by the new coronavirus reported in China and neighboring countries, such as Japan and Thailand [8], human-to-human transmission should be thoroughly investigated.",

It is imperative that animal reservoirs that transmitted the virus to humans be identified as quickly as possible to aid in control of this disease. It is thus urgent that the results of animal testing from the seafood market in Wuhan, where the virus was initially isolated, be released as soon as possible. This is particularly crucial given the rapidly approaching Lunar Chinese New Year, which will take place on 25 January 2020, during which tens of millions of people will travel, and large amounts of animal meats, some of which may contain this virus, will be consumed. It is noteworthy that recently the local health administration in Wuhan issued guidance regarding the prevention and treatment of the pneumonia caused by this coronavirus [9]. It is also encouraging that the World Health Organization has issued detailed guidance on the clinical management of the disease in relation to this outbreak [10].",
