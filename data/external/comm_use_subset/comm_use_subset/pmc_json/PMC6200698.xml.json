For example, crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering experiment have shown that the N-terminal region of MERS-N exists as a monomer and has structural features that are similar to other coronavirus [12]. Like mouse hepatitis virus, porcine epidemic disease virus and SARS-CoV, MERS-N has been reported to be ADP-ribosylated [13] and acts as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing in mammalian cells [14]. However, the latter noted that MERS-N showed lower activity than the N proteins of other coronavirus tested. Similar to mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV, MERS-N has been found to be essential for the packaging of viral RNA into virus-like particles [15].",

Interferon treatment has been reported to effectively subdue MERS-CoV replication [16]; however, like any successful viral infection, MERS-CoV has developed mechanisms to evade or dampen the activity of the host immune responses. Studies have demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection shows a delayed but marked induction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines [17]. In the present study, we aim to determine if the MERS-N protein is involved in regulating host antiviral response to infection. We showed that the MERS-N protein could contribute to the regulation of several host antiviral response genes including CXCL10. Importantly, up-regulation of CXCL10 has been reported in MERS patients [18,19] as well as MERS-CoV infected cells [3,17,20]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that MERS-N has been shown to be one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection and this suggests that MERS-N may contribute to viral pathogenesis.",

Transient transfection of A549 cells was also performed and high expression of MERS-N was achieved (Figure 4A). Similarly to the observation in 293FT cells, the overexpression of MERS-N in A549 cells resulted in a significant increase in the mRNA levels of CXCL10 (Figure 4B) and its secretion (Figure 4C,D) when compared with vector-transfected cells.

Consistently, both full-length N and N196-413, but not N1-195, increased the secretion of CXCL10 when compared with vector-transfected cells (Figure 5C). As N1-195 contains N-terminal domain and SR-rich motif, it appears that these domains are not involved in the up-regulation of CXCL10. N196-413 contains part of the linker region, C-terminal domain and the intrinsically disordered region at the C-terminal tail and further studies are required to determine which of these domains are required for up-regulation CXCL10 expression.",

Upon infection by MERS-CoV, cytokine/chemokine regulations have been reported in airway epithelial cells and lung fibroblast cells [17] as well as monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells [3,20,23]. In the present study, we showed that the overexpression of MERS-N protein in A549 (lung) and 293FT (kidney) up-regulated TNF, IL6, IL8, and CXCL10 on the transcriptional levels, suggesting that MERS-N protein may be able to regulate multiple antiviral genes in different tissues. On the protein level, the overexpression of MERS-N protein in 293FT also increased the secretion of CXCL10, albeit at low levels, but not TNF, IL6, and IL8. It is not clear that why the secretion of CXCL10 was low despite a robust up-regulation on mRNA levels by approximately 10-fold in MERS-N expressing cells, but one possible reason could be the low efficiency of cytokine/chemokine secretion from 293FT cells. Similarly, the overexpression of MERS-N protein in A549 cells also led to transcriptional and translational up-regulation of CXCL10. As MERS-CoV has been reported to infect immune cells, further studies could be performed to study the effects of MERS-N on the expression of antiviral genes in different types of immune cells.",

            "text": "CXCL10 is a cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family and binds to the CXCR3 receptor to induce chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth, and angiostasis. Expression levels of CXCL10 have been associated with inflammatory diseases including infectious diseases, immune dysfunction, and tumor development [19,24]. High expressions of CXCL10 have been reported in individuals infected with pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites [24]. CXCL10 regulation has been reported in MERS patients [18,19] as well as MERS-CoV infected cells [3,17,20]. Our results suggest that the MERS-N protein is one of the contributing factors for CXCL10 up-regulation during infection. In addition, a fragment of MERS-N consisting of residues 196\u2013413 is sufficient to up-regulate CXCL10. Future works will focus on identifying the exact motif in MERS-N that is contributing to the up-regulation of CXCL10, and delineating the relative contribution of MERS-N and different viral proteins to this up-regulation which may have implication for viral pathogenesis.",
