            "text": "We recently reported that the CTD of the HKU1 S protein contained the RBD and the epitopes for neutralizing antibodies mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 (ref. 29). To gain structural and molecular insights into the receptor binding motif and neutralizing epitopes, we carried out a crystallographic study on the CTD of the HKU1 S protein. We designed several CTD-containing constructs with various N- and C-termini on the basis of the available structural information for the S proteins of other CoVs and secondary structure prediction of the S1 protein of HKU1. Among them, the construct encoding residues 310\u2013677 (numbering from the amino acid sequence of S protein of HKU1 genotype A, or 1A), designated as 1A-S310-677aa, gave the highest level of protein expression in our insect expression system. Moreover, the purified 1A-S310-677aa protein was recognized by four conformational antibodies in ELISA, including mHKUS-2, -3, -4 and -6 (Fig. 1b). The mHKUS-1 only recognizes NTD of HKU1 S protein29. More importantly, HKU1 virus infection on primary HTBE cells was reduced approximately fivefold by pre-incubation and addition of 1A-S310-677aa at 20 \u03bcM (Fig. 1c,d), whereas NTD of HKU1 S protein did not show marked inhibition at the same concentration (Supplementary Fig. 2A and refs 16, 29). These results indicate that the function and overall conformation of the purified 1A-S310-677aa protein was nearly intact. After removal of its 6xhis-tag, 1A-S310-677aa protein formed crystals in the C2221 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The crystals diffracted to 1.9 \u00c5 resolution, and the structure of 1A-S310-677aa was solved using native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing34. Native-SAD takes advantage of the weak anomalous signal of light elements naturally present in biological macromolecules such as sulfur and phosphorus. The construct 1A-SS310-677aa contains 24 cysteines. The anomalous scattering from sulfur and phosphorus is very weak and requires merging of multiple data sets from either multiple crystals or from a single crystal collected in multiple orientations. Accordingly, 16 data sets from two isomorphous crystals collected in multiple orientations were scaled and merged. The final dataset had an anomalous signal extending to \u223c3.1 \u00c5 and its overall resolution was better than 2.3 \u00c5 (CC1/2 of highest-resolution shell: 89.4%). The final structure had excellent refinement statistics and stereochemistry quality (Table 1).",

The structure consists of three subdomains: the core, the insertion or variable loop, and the SD-1.The core and insertion loop form the CTD of the HKU1 S1 subunit. The overall structure of 1A-S310-677aa resembles the shape of a two-arm \u2018boomerang\u2019 with the core and SD-1 subdomains in one arm and the insertion loop in the other arm. The core subdomain of 1A-S310-677aa is comprised of residues from 311 to 428 and 589 to 613, and has nine \u03b2-sheets (\u03b21-7, \u03b213-14) and five helices (\u03b11-5) (Fig. 2). The topology of the core subdomain is highly similar to those of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU4 and MHV (Fig. 3). Five-stranded anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets (\u03b23-7, \u03b213) are sandwiched by five connecting helices (\u03b11-5) with \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 on one side and \u03b14 and \u03b15 on the other side (Fig. 2). The structure is further stabilized by three pairs of disulfide bonds between cysteine 327 and 352, 370 and 423, and 382 and 605 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). These disulfide bridges are also conserved in the CTDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "The insertion loops of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV contain the receptor-binding motifs essential for receptor interaction252627. We previously found that the receptor binding motif of the HKU1 S protein was likely also present in the insertion loop29. Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the insertion loop of HKU1 CTD is much bigger and spans residues 429\u2013588, making it larger than the core structure in terms of the number of amino acids. The structure of the insertion loop consists of five \u03b2-sheets (\u03b28-12) and five helices (\u03b16-10), and the overall shape resembles an \u2018ox horn\u2019 (Fig. 2). The tip of the \u2018horn\u2019 is formed by folding back two anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets, \u03b210 and \u03b211. Of note, the subdomain contains several extended loops that lack the obvious secondary structures and is highly cysteine-rich. Sixteen cysteine residues form eight pairs of disulfide bonds, providing essential restraints that stabilize the structure. The insertion loop is a part of CTD and is one of the most variable regions in the S protein. The structures of five other \u03b2-CoVs CTDs are available, including MHV (lineage A), SARS-CoV (lineage B), MERS-CoV (lineage C), HKU4 (lineage C) and HKU9 (lineage D). Their CTDs shares 47.1%, 19.0%, 25.3%, 22.1% and 17.1% amino acid sequence identity with HKU1 CTD, respectively. The structure alignment of the CTDs from different \u03b2-CoVs reveals that the structure of the insertion loop of HKU1 significantly differs from the others (Fig. 3). The r.m.s.d. values for the structural alignments of these CTDs are 1.9 \u00c5 between MHV and HKU1, based on 187 aligned residues (59% of MHV CTD); 2.2 \u00c5 between SARS and HKU1, based on 142 aligned residues (82% of residues in SARS CTD); 2.1 \u00c5 between MERS and HKU1, based on 158 aligned residues (76% residues in MERS CTD); 2.52 \u00c5 between HKU4 and HKU1, based on 136 aligned residues (65% of HKU4 CTD); and 2.36 \u00c5 between HKU9 and HKU1, based on 146 aligned residues (86% HKU9 CTD). A Dali server search against all available structures returned no homologue hits, indicating that the structure of the insertion loop of 1A-S310-677aa is novel.",

All five \u03b2-sheets form a \u03b2-sandwich, with \u03b215 and \u03b216 in one layer and \u03b217-19 in the other layer. The two layers stack tightly against each other through extensive hydrophobic interactions. The SD-1 of HKU1 shares \u223c70% amino acid sequence identity with MHV, and their structures are also highly conserved33. The structure alignment of MHV and HKU1 SD-1 gave an r.m.s.d. value of 0.96 \u00c5 based on 60 aligned residues (100% of MHV SD-1). It is worth noting that \u03b215 and \u03b21 form parallel \u03b2-sheets, connecting the SD-1 subdomain to the core subdomain, and \u03b21 is also directly connected with the NTD of the S protein1833. The \u03b21 appears to play an important role in maintaining the metastable state of the S protein before binding to the receptor. A Tyr to Ala substitution at the position 320 (Y320A) in the \u03b21 of the S protein of MHV A59 (equivalent to H318 in HKU1 S, Supplementary Fig. 1) causes spontaneous dissociation of S1 from S protein and results in formation of receptor- and pH- independent syncytia in 293 T cells (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that the Y320A mutation in MHV S protein may disrupt the interactions between SD-1 and the core subdomain, and somehow cause the dissociation of S1 from S2 even without receptor binding, leading to conformational changes of S2 and membrane fusion. Previously Kirchdoerfer et al18 postulated that the complex folding of SD-1 and SD-2 may allow receptor-induced conformational changes in the CTD to be transmitted to other parts of the S protein. Because SD-1 is connected to both NTD and CTD and the Y320A mutation in MHV S protein destabilizes the association between S1 and S2, we propose that SD-1 may serve as a key motif to allow receptor-induced conformational changes in either the NTD or CTD to be transmitted to other parts of the S protein.",

            "text": "Since the majority of the insertion domain was missing in the EM structures of the trimeric HKU1 S proteins, integration of the high resolution structure of 1A-S310-677aa into the EM structure of the HKU1 S protein would aid our understanding of how the HKU1 S protein interacts with its unknown receptor and how the neutralizing antibodies, mHKUS-2 and -3, inhibit HKU1 virus infection. Using the core and SD-1 subdomains as references, we superimposed the crystal structure of 1A-S310-677aa onto the EM structure of the HKU1 S protein. This superimposition aligned 181 C\u03b1 atoms of the core and SD-1 subdomains with an r.m.s.d. value of 1.2 \u00c5, indicating a good fit. In this integrated model, all four glycosylation sites previously identified in the crystal structure remained well exposed. While N433 and N454 lie on the top of the trimer, N355 and N470 are at the side of the trimer (Fig. 4). Consistent with previous findings18, the structural alignment of CTDs of HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showed that the regions in the HKU1 CTD equivalent to the receptor-binding motifs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are buried between two adjacent monomers in the trimeric HKU1 S proteins. Interestingly, the recently reported cryo-EM structure of the human \u03b1-CoV NL63 S protein reveals that many critical receptor-binding residues in the NL63 S protein were also either buried or masked by glycosylation in native trimer, and direct binding of the S protein to its receptor, hACE2, requires significant conformational changes in the S protein35. Hiding the receptor binding motif might serve as an important immune evasion strategy to avoid the generation of potent neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding motif35.",

            "text": "Phylogenetically, there are three genotypes of HKU1 viruses (A, B and C) derived from viral recombination events. The S proteins from genotypes B and C are identical. The S proteins of genotype B/C (designated as 1B) share approximately 85% identity with genotype A (designated as 1A) and \u223c76% identity in the CTD. Since there is a significant sequence difference in CTDs between 1A and 1B, we next determined whether the S1 protein of 1B (1B-S14-752aa) was recognized by our neutralizing antibodies (previously only tested on HKU1 genotype A). The mHKUS-1 antibody, which recognizes the NTD of the HKU1-A S protein, strongly bound the purified 1B-S14-752aa protein (Supplementary Fig. 4). To our surprise, no other antibodies (mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-4, nor mHKUS-6) showed marked binding to 1B-S14-752aa (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that the epitopes for these antibodies might lie in the sequence differences in the CTDs between 1A and 1B. To further delineate the neutralizing epitopes of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3, we constructed six 1A/1B chimeras (1A/B-1 to 1A/B-6) using 1A-S310-677aa as the backbone (Fig. 5a). All chimeric proteins were expressed and their affinity to the neutralizing antibodies was evaluated. All chimeras were recognized by the conformational antibody mHKUS-4, indicating that the overall conformation of all chimeras was relatively intact. While 1A/B-1, 1A/B-2, 1A/B-4, 1A/B-5 and 1A/B-6 were bound to the neutralizing antibodies mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 at levels similar to 1A-S310-677aa, 1A/B-3 lost nearly all affinity to mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the epitopes for mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 may be present between amino acid 505\u2013514, where the tip of the \u2018horn\u2019 is located. The tip has two possible interfaces that are accessible to antibody binding. To ascertain which interface was critical for binding, we investigated where the non-neutralizing antibody mHKUS-6 binds to 1A-S310-677aa. The mHKU-6 strongly bound to 1A/B -1, 1A/B -3, 1A/B -4 and 1A/B -6, but failed to bind to 1A/B -2 and only showed minimal affinity to 1A/B -5 (Fig. 5a), indicating that the epitopes for mHKUS-6 are located at amino acids 478\u2013503 and 551\u2013571. Further analysis of the structure of 1A-S310-677aa reveals that mHKUS-6 likely binds to the helix formed by amino acid 480\u2013484 and the nearby loop consisting of residues 560\u2013564, next to the outer interface of the tip (Fig. 5a). Since mHKUS-6 is a non-neutralizing antibody, we reasoned that the neutralizing epitopes of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 likely lie on the inner interface of the tip and that the tip is highly immunogenic.",

While all mutant proteins were recognized by the mHKUS-6 antibody (Fig. 5b), indicating that these individual mutations have minimal effect on the overall conformation of 1A-S310-677aa, replacement of the amino acids V509, L510, D511, H512 or W515 with alanine nearly completely abolished the binding of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 to 1A-S310-677aa (Fig. 5b), suggesting that V509, L510, D511, H512, and W515 are essential for binding mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3. The R517A mutant also significantly reduced the affinity of 1A-S310-677aa with mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 (Fig. 5b), indicating that R517 is also important for mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 binding.

We individually mutated the residues conserved between1A-S310-677aa and 1B-S310-676aa in or close to the neutralizing antibody-interacting interface (Fig. 6a) and determined whether the purified mutant proteins inhibited HKU1 virus infection of primary HTBE cells. All mutant proteins were bound to conformational antibodies the mHKUS-4 and mHKUS-6 (Fig. 6a), indicating that the mutations have a minimal effect on the protein conformation. While the majority of mutations showed no effect on the inhibition of HKU1 virus infection on primary HTBE cells by 1A-S310-677aa, substitution of W515 or R517 with Ala almost abolished inhibition (Fig. 6b,c), indicating that W515 and R517 are critical for binding of 1A-S310-677aa to the unknown receptor. Of note, both W515 and R517 are located in a groove adjacent to the tip. Furthermore, most residues constituting the groove (Supplementary Fig. 4), including E505, W515, R517, C518, S519, S520, L521 and Y528, are conserved. The groove is \u223c11 \u00c5 long, 10 \u00c5 wide and 4 \u00c5 deep, with a solvent accessible area of 779 \u00c52. Its size suggests that the groove should be able to accommodate a sugar moiety or amino acid side chains, and therefore may function as a major receptor binding motif.",

CoVs have evolved to utilize different parts of the S protein to bind sugars, but the NTD of HKU1 is particularly intriguing. The NTDs of OC43 and BCoV fold like a galectin and bind to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid1728, and their amino acid sequences are highly homologous to the NTD of HKU1. However, despite the fact that several critical sugar-interacting residues in the NTD of BCoV are also conserved in the NTD of HKU1, purified HKU1 NTD neither binds to sugars17 nor to the cells that bind to HKU1 S1 (ref. 16). Moreover, while the BCoV NTD significantly decreased BCoV infection of HRT-18 g cells (Supplementary Fig. 2B), the HKU1 NTD did not inhibit any infection of HKU1 virus of primary HTBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and refs 16, 29), indicating that the HKU1 NTD likely does not participate in receptor binding. We performed a glycan array screen for 1A-S310-677aa. Interestingly, despite the lack of an obvious common sugar motif in the binding pattern, 1A-S310-677aa showed strong binding to several different sugars (Supplementary Data 1). Among these, Gal\u03b21-4Glc\u03b2-Sp0 gave the strongest binding, and the Gal\u03b21-4Glc motif was also present in several other sugars that showed higher binding. However, multiple attempts to co-crystalize 1A-S310-677aa with \u03b2-lactose (Gal\u03b21-4Glc) were unsuccessful, and the binding affinity of 1A-S310-677aa with \u03b2-lactose was close to background when measured using isothermal titration calorimetry. Of note, 4-, 7- and 8-O-acetyl sialic acids are absent in our glycan array, and whether these sugars constitute the attachment factor needs to be further studied.",

Since the HKU1 NTD does not appear to bind either one, the CTD must recognize both of them. We propose that these interactions can occur in one of several ways. The receptor binding groove contributes to the binding of one of them. The initial binding at the receptor binding groove may trigger conformational changes, leading to exposure of the second binding site to the other receptor. This is similar to what happens when the HIV envelope protein binds to CD4 and CCR5. The NL63 S protein may use a similar strategy, although it is unknown whether binding of heparan sulfate by NL63 S protein can trigger conformational changes that lead to exposure of ACE2 binding motifs in S protein. Alternatively, the hydrophobic pocket located at the top of the HKU1 CTD, which contains highly conserved residues between HKU1-A and HKU1-B (Supplementary Fig. 5), may serve as the other receptor binding site.",

Codon-optimized genotype B HKU1 S1 gene (Access#: AGT17758.1) preceded by a Kozak sequence (Supplementary Table 2) was also synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (pcDNAHKU1B S1). A DNA fragment encoding HKU1B S310-676aa (residues 310\u2013676) was amplified by PCR using pcDNAHKU1B S1 as the template and cloned into pFastBac-1 for insect cell expression. All mutagenesis was carried out using Q5 mutagenesis kit (NEB, MA, USA). After the entire coding sequences were verified by sequencing, the sequences were cloned back into the pFastBac-1.",

However, 1A-S310-677aa was cysteine-rich and contained 24 cysteines. Its Bijvoet ratio is approximately 1.77% at 5.96 keV, making the 1A-S310-677aa crystal a suitable candidate for native SAD phasing. The diffraction data collection and structure determination using the native SAD method have been described elsewhere34. Briefly, all diffraction data were collected at the macromolecular crystallography super-bending magnet beamline X06DA (PXIII) at the Swiss Light Source at an X-ray energy of 6 keV (2.0663 \u00c5 wavelength) using the Pilatus 2M-F detector. Sixteen datasets were collected from two isomorphous crystals at a size of 90 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 20 \u03bcm3. Each dataset consisted of 1,800 images collected with 60% transmission (flux of \u223c0.9 \u00d7 1010 photons per second), and all diffraction data were indexed and integrated using XDS software36. Scaling was performed with XSCALE. The data quality was assessed using PHENIX.XTRIAGE37. The substructures were determined using SHELXD in 1,000 trials with a cutoff of 3.2 \u00c5. Phasing was performed using SHELXE with combined chain tracing and density modification. From experimentally phased maps, initial models were built with BUCCANEER and PHENIX.AUTOBUILD37, and refined by manual model building with COOT38. The final dataset had an anomalous signal extending to \u223c3.1 \u00c5 and the overall resolution was better than 2.3 \u00c5 (CC1/2 of highest resolution shell: 89.4%). Final models were obtained using datasets collected at higher energy (1.00 \u00c5) with a resolution at 1.9 \u00c5 and by molecular replacement using the initial model generated from the native SAD datasets.",
