However, because of the 2009 pandemic, the Australian government recommended and funded universal use of inactivated pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination for those aged >6 months in 2010. Hence, a RCT design became unethical. The study was restructured to a prospective cohort design addressing the epidemiology of ILIs among young children.",

Parents reported influenza vaccinations their children had received and, where possible, the influenza vaccination status was validated from vaccination records.

During the ILI-reporting period, each family received a weekly e-mail, text message or telephone call to remind them to contact the study team immediately if a child developed an ILI. Before the ILI-reporting period, e-mail addresses and mobile telephone numbers of all parents/guardians were confirmed with parents/guardians to ensure that they received messages. In addition, during the 1 week of the ILI-reporting period, all parents/guardians were contacted/recontacted until they indicated that they had received the message that the ILI-reporting period had commenced. Parents/guardians were provided with plastic shaft rayon-budded swabs and plastic transport tubes with a foam pad reservoir soaked in viral transport medium (Virocult MW950; Medical Wire & Equipment, Wiltshire, UK). They were given verbal and written instructions on how to collect a nose swab and a throat swab from the subject whenever an ILI occurred. We asked for a nose swab to be done first and did not insist on a throat swab if the parents felt uncomfortable to collect one. Parents mailed swabs to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory (QPID), where they were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until tested.",

All RNA virus assays used Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR, Qiagen (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), and all DNA virus assays used Qiagen Quantitect Probe PCR Mix, Qiagen, Australia. In order to assess extraction quality, specimens were spiked with equine herpes virus-1 (EHV-1) and tested for EHV-1 using a duplex real-time PCR assay. Any samples that failed the EHV-1 quality control were re-extracted. In order to monitor quality of specimen collection, specimens were tested for human endogenous retrovirus 3 (ERV3) using a duplex real-time PCR assay.

Symptomatic ILIs were reported significantly more commonly in recipients of influenza vaccination (Table 1). Non-influenza ILIs were more common among fully vaccinated subjects (33 non-influenza ILIs, 1\u00b759/person-year of observation) and partially vaccinated subjects (20 non-influenza ILIs, 1\u00b754/person-year) than among unvaccinated subjects (59 non-influenza ILIs, 0\u00b799/person-year, P = 0\u00b7001, rate ratio 1\u00b76, vaccinated versus unvaccinated, Table 1). Excluding ILIs from which no virus was identified made no significant difference to this finding. No particular respiratory virus, with the exception of AV, was found less frequently in ILI episodes among unvaccinated subjects compared to fully or partially vaccinated subjects (P = 0\u00b704, data not shown). The vaccination status of subjects was not correlated with the mean number of doctor (GP, emergency department or specialist) visits made in response to non-influenza ILIs (P = 0\u00b745, data not shown). Nor were there significant differences in the mean duration of ILIs (P = 0\u00b795) or use of antibiotics (P = 0\u00b792) for non-influenza ILIs between fully or partially vaccinated subjects and unvaccinated subjects (data not shown). However, before enrolment in the study, there was evidence for an increased use of healthcare services in both the partially and fully vaccinated groups with significantly higher rates of prior hospitalisation, hearing tests and grommet insertion, whereas the incidence of past otitis media was not significantly different between the groups (Table 1). Increased use of these healthcare services did not, however, prove significant when added to a multivariate model to predict non-influenza ILI in study subjects (data not shown).",
