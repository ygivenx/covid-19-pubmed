DENV infection causes dengue fever (DF) and the more severe forms of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). DENV has four serotypes (DENV-1 to -4), each of which is capable of causing severe disease. The frequency, severity, and geographical spread of cases have increased over the past decades [1], [2]. Every year, one hundred million new cases of DF and 250,000 DHF/DSS are estimated by the WHO. At present, despite intensive global research efforts, no vaccine or antiviral treatment for dengue infection is available. Vaccine development is complex due to multiple factors. (i) An effective vaccine must consist of a tetravalent formulation protecting against each of the four serotypes because more than one serotype typically circulates in a region. (ii) A sub-protective vaccine potentially increases the risk of vaccinees to develop the more severe forms of dengue during repeated infection because of a known association of pre-existing immunity with severity [3], [4]. (iii) Since most infections occur in developing countries, an ideal vaccine should be affordable and fully protective [5]. Taken together, a vaccine inducing a robust level of immunity ideally with only one inoculation is required.",

Live-attenuated viruses do not cause disease because of the low level of replication and hence low levels of inflammation. Prominent examples of successful live-attenuated vaccines providing long-term immunity are those against vaccinia virus, poliovirus (Sabin), and two members of the Flaviviridae family, yellow fever virus (YF-17D) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV SA14-14-2) [6]. Live-attenuated DENV vaccines have been shown to induce protective neutralizing antibody titers in mice, monkeys, and humans [7]\u2013[9]. In addition, evidence that a balanced T cell response contributes to protection is accumulating, emphasizing the importance of T cell epitopes in a vaccine [8].",

            "text": "Flaviviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The flavivirus genome encodes for 3 structural (C, prM, and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). NS5 is a multifunctional protein, consisting of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [10] and methyltransferase (MTase) activities responsible for 5\u2032 RNA cap formation [11], [12] as well as internal RNA methylation [13]. While N-7-methylation is essential for RNA translation and stability, the function of 2\u2032-O-methylation has remained elusive until recently. We and others demonstrated that while 2\u2032-O-MTase is not essential for viral replication in vitro, viruses bearing mutations in the highly conserved MTase catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad are severely attenuated in the host due to the inability of the virus to shield viral RNA from recognition by host innate immune factors [14], [15]. DENV RNA binds to RIG-I and MDA5 [16], [17], which activates interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 production via a cascade involving IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) [17]. IFNs in turn activate IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), which induce antiviral responses in infected and neighbouring cells. IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are critical for the inhibition of viral infections, although their functions are only partially understood [14], [18]. The human IFIT gene family comprises four members: IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 ( = IFIT4), and IFIT5; whereas mice only express IFIT1, 2 and 3 [19]. Interestingly, IFIT homologs are conserved from amphibians to mammals, suggesting that they play a central role in the innate immune response [19]. IFIT1 and 2 bind to eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3 (eIF3) and inhibit translation [20], whereas IFIT3 amplifies the antiviral signal by connecting IPS-1 and TBK1, resulting in more IFN production [21]. The role of human IFIT5 is less well understood.",

The mutation was stable over several passages and reversion to wild-type (WT) was not observed. For further safety improvement, a second mutation in the 2\u2032-O-MTase catalytic tetrad was introduced without affecting the viability of the virus in vitro. A single dose administration to rhesus macaques (RM) conferred protection to homologous DENV challenge. Mice immunized with a single dose of a divalent (DENV-1/2) formulation of the mutant viruses and mice immunized with the monovalent formulation showed comparable antibody responses, demonstrating that there was no interference between two serotypes of the DENV MTase mutants. Moreover, no enhanced infection and increased TNF-\u03b1 levels were observed in immunized mice upon challenge with heterologous virus. Overexpression of IFITs in HEK-DC-SIGN cells suggested a role for IFIT1 in the attenuation of MTase mutant in human cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants as a DENV vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first live-attenuated rational vaccine approach, tailored to optimally activate the innate and adaptive immune response while being severely attenuated due to its susceptibility to the IFN response.",

            "text": "Flaviviruses replicate in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm-replicating viruses have evolved N7- and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases (MTase) to methylate their viral mRNA 5\u2032 cap structures [22]. We have previously shown for West Nile virus (WNV) and DENV-1 that mutation of the Asp of the tetrad K-D-K-E completely abolished both N7- and 2\u2032-O-MTase activities and was lethal for viral replication; mutations of the other three residues of the tetrad abolished 2\u2032-O-methylation (with a decrease in N7-methylation), and led to attenuated viruses [14], [23]. Since there are four serotypes of DENV, we introduced the same MTase mutations into DENV-2 to examine whether the same approach was feasible with more than one serotype. A WT recombinant MTase, representing the N-terminal 296 amino acids of the DENV-2 NS5 (strain TSV01), was cloned and expressed. Two mutant MTases containing Ala-substitutions at the K-D-K-E tetrad (Fig. 1A) were prepared: one with a single E217A mutation and another with double K61A+E217A mutations. The mutant enzymes retained 95% and 77% of the WT N7-methylation activity, respectively; neither mutant exhibited any 2\u2032-O-methylation activity (Fig. 1B). BHK-21 cells transfected with equal amounts of WT and mutant (E217A and K61A+E217A) genome-length RNAs of DENV-2 generated equivalent numbers of viral E protein-expressing cells (Fig. 1C). Both WT and mutant RNAs produced infectious viruses (passage 0) with similar plaque morphologies (Fig. 1D). The replication of mutant viruses was attenuated in mammalian Vero and mosquito C3/36 cells (Fig. 1E). Continuous culturing of the mutant viruses on Vero cells or HEK-293 cells expressing DC-SIGN (HEK-DC-SIGN) for ten rounds (3\u20134 days per round) did not change their plaque morphologies (Fig. 1D and data not shown). The expression of DC-SIGN facilitates DENV infection [24]. Sequencing of the passage 0 and 10 viruses from both Vero and HEK-DC-SIGN cells showed that the engineered mutations were retained (Supplementary Fig. S1a and S1b). Similar results were obtained for DENV-1 containing the E216A (E216 in DENV-1 MTase is equivalent to E217 in DENV-2 MTase) or K61A+E216A mutation in MTase (Supplementary Fig. S2). Collectively, the results demonstrate that the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV-1 and -2 are slightly attenuated, but stable in cell culture.",

AG129 mice are not suitable to study T cell responses because of their lack of IFN-\u03b3 signaling, which is critical to activate T cells. We therefore used IFNAR mice lacking the receptor for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 [33]. IFNAR mice were immunized with 2.75\u00d7105 Pfu DENV-2 E217A or DENV-2 WT and spleens were harvested at day 7 for restimulation in vitro and detection of IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 3A). Mutant and WT virus elicited a strong CD4 and CD8 T cell response after re-stimulation with DENV-2. The CD4 response was weaker in E217A-immunized mice, likely due to the lower total viral load in E217A-immunized mice compared to mice immunized with the WT virus (Fig. 3B). To test for targeted DENV T cell response splenocytes were re-stimulated with a pool of NS4B and NS5 CD8 peptides described by Yauch et al [32]. No significant difference in the NS4B and NS5-specific T cell response was seen between mice immunized with E217A or WT DENV-2 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, DENV 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants induce a T cell response and epitope presentation that is similar to WT infection. Nevertheless, additional studies in mice and monkeys are necessary to assess the T cell response in greater detail and to test its functional contribution to protection.",

Increased TNF-\u03b1 levels were associated with pathology in the AG129 mouse model in the context of ADE [35]. To further assess the possibility of ADE-associated pathology, we measured TNF-\u03b1 levels in plasma three days after challenge. High levels of TNF-\u03b1 were only detected in unimmunized (PBS) mice, showing that TNF-\u03b1 as a marker of pathology was independent of ADE, and that immunization with E216A did not cause ADE after heterologous challenge. These data demonstrate that immunization with E217A protects mice against challenge with an aggressive, virulent DENV-2 strain that causes 100% mortality in unimmunized mice.",

One group received a low dose (1\u00d7103 PFU), one group a medium dose (1\u00d7104 PFU), and one group a high dose (1\u00d7105 PFU) of E217A virus. Viremia was monitored during 10 days after inoculation. The E217A virus was severely attenuated, and no viremia was detected except for one animal (R0105) that had received a high dose (1\u00d7105 PFU) and developed a low viremia (Table 2). Virus was extracted for sequencing, and it was confirmed that the E217A mutation was retained in the virus extracted at days 3, 4 and 7 from this animal. Importantly, full virus genome sequencing of the viral RNA recovered at day 7 showed that no compensatory mutations were introduced (data not shown). All immunized monkeys developed neutralizing antibodies to DENV-2 on day 15 after immunization (Table 3). ADE was analyzed in a K562 assay and a similar enhancement pattern was observed for both heterologous and homologous infection in vitro: ADE correlated with the neutralizing titer, ie the higher the NT50 the higher the enhancement (Supplementary Fig. S4). This argues against a physiologically relevant infection enhancement, which would only be expected after heterologous infection. By day 30 after immunization, all monkeys including the ones with low dose immunization developed high titers (GMT\u226592) of neutralizing antibodies (Table 3). The monkeys were then challenged with 1\u00d7105 PFU of WT DENV-2 on day 64 post-immunization. No viremia was detected in all immunized monkey, whereas all four PBS-immunized controls had a mean peak virus titer of 2.5 log10 PFU/ml and mean viremia duration of 4.8 days (Table 4). In all animals except one (R0055), anamnestic antibody responses were observed after challenge (Table 3). These data demonstrate that live, attenuated DENV MTase mutant virus, even when administrated at low dose (1\u00d7103 PFU), can induce protective immunity in non-human primates.",

To assess whether this is true for DENV as well, we pretreated HEK-DC-SIGN cells with an increasing dose of IFN-\u03b2 for 24 h. While HEK-DC-SIGN cells are susceptible to type I IFN, they do not produce detectable levels of IFN-\u03b2 after infection with mutant or WT virus (data not shown). The IFN-\u03b2-treated cells were infected with WT or mutant E217A DENV-2. The E217A virus was significantly more sensitive to IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment than the WT virus, as demonstrated by the percentage of infected cells (Fig. 5A) as well as the viral titers in culture supernatants (Fig. 5B). To test the stability of the mutation under IFN pressure and in different cell types we passaged the virus in the presence of 0, 20 and 200 U/ml IFN-\u03b2 in HEK-DC-SIGN and U937-DC-SIGN. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S5, E217A was lost in the presence of IFN, whereas wild-type virus resisted the IFN pressure in both cell lines. E217A isolated from passage three in HEK-DC-SIGN and from passage one in U937-DC-SIGN was isolated for sequencing.

The WT virus infection was not affected, whereas E217A mutants were significantly inhibited by IFIT1, but not IFIT2, 3, or 5. However, IFIT1 over-expression did not completely block E217A infection nor did it affect virus output from the infected cells (Fig. 5D), suggesting that other IFN-mediated signals are involved in the response against DENV. Both mutant and WT virus show similar growth kinetics in untreated cells (Fig. 5E). We currently don't know why the mutant virus is attenuated in Vero cells but not in HEK-DC-SIGN since both lines are deficient in IFN production. It should be noted that the maximum antiviral effect of IFITs could be underestimated due to the low transfection efficiency (30\u201350%) of the IFIT-expressing plasmids.",

            "text": "Various dengue vaccine strategies are currently under development, including live attenuated virus, subunit vaccines, chimeric viruses, and DNA vaccines [36], [37]. The YFV 17D-based chimeric dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi-Pasteur is the most advanced in clinical testing [38], [39]. The establishment of reverse genetic manipulation of DENV has greatly facilitated the generation of promising vaccine candidates [36], [38]. The recent progress in understanding the mechanism of attenuation of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant flaviviruses has provided a novel approach for vaccine and antiviral development [40]. Here we show in a proof-of-concept study that MTase mutant E216A DENV-1 and E217A DENV-2 strains are stable in vitro, and safe and immunogenic in vivo. Importantly, enhancement of infection was not observed after heterologous infection of immunized mice. The fear in a clinical setting is that sub-neutralizing titers of antibodies could enhance infections, even though this has so far not happened in the context of vaccine trials in humans [41]. A commonly used approach to address ADE in vitro is to infect K562 cells in the presence of antibodies. Virus alone is not able to infect K562 cells efficiently, whereas virus-antibody immune complexes bind to K562 cells via Fc-\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3R's), assisting the internalization of the virus and infection of the cells. We found that K562 cells could be infected in the presence of serum from immunized mice and monkeys at dilutions that were approximately 50% neutralizing in the U937-DC-SIGN system (Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4). This is in line with a previous report, which found that even strongly neutralizing antibodies are enhancing at concentrations that are close to the 50% neutralizing titer [42]. Clinically relevant ADE would be expected at sub-neutralizing titers and only after heterologous infection, and this was not observed in our experiments. A caveat of the K562 system is that the cells do not express inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIb, which is present on human target cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) and which negatively regulates ADE [43], [44]. Physiological amounts of complement, another negative regulator of ADE, are also not taken into account [45]. In summary, while the K562 assays done here did not show more ADE for heterologous infections, we cannot exclude ADE because of the limitations of the assay. Potential ADE will have to be addressed in further monkey studies.",

            "text": "Live attenuated dengue vaccine candidates have several advantages. Importantly, they can induce long lasting humoral and cellular immune responses to both structural and non-structural viral proteins. In this study we show a CD8 response to NS4B and NS5 peptides that is similar in mice immunized with mutant or WT virus, suggesting that the response is qualitatively equivalent. Chimeric viruses using the same backbone for all four DENV serotype glycoproteins would induce a type-specific response restricted to the structural proteins of one DENV serotype [36]. The interdependence of the T and B cell response for the efficient generation of immune memory has been demonstrated in a number of human studies [46], [47]. We speculate that the advantage of an attenuated non-chimeric DENV that includes all naturally occurring T and B cell epitopes could be that only one vaccination is required to confer long-term immunity to re-infection, as seen for natural DENV infections [48], [49]. A single-dose vaccine would facilitate the logistics of a vaccination program and would significantly reduce its cost compared to candidates requiring several booster immunizations. The 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant DENV vaccine approach, with a known mechanism of attenuation, can be readily generated using a reverse genetic system. This is in contrast to the method to develop live attenuated vaccines by passaging of WT viruses in cell lines, leading to the introduction of random mutations. The reverse genetic system-based rational vaccine ensures that the vaccine maintains the attenuated genotype. Additionally, a tetravalent formulation would contain the same attenuating mutation in all four serotype recombinant vaccine strains, making the generation of a more pathogenic virus by intra vaccine-strain recombination impossible. Moreover, recombination in cell culture is hardly observed in flaviviruses, suggesting that flaviviruses are not prone to evolution by recombination [50]. By introducing additional mutations in the K-D-K-E tetrad of 2\u2032-O-MTase, further safety and attenuation can be achieved. Only a virus that has at least two mutations will be acceptable in the clinical setting. Our data demonstrate that the 2\u2032-O-MTase E217A virus is attenuated in mice and monkeys. We cannot explain fully why the 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant virus was attenuated (10-fold lower virus titer compared to WT virus) in AG129 mice, which are unable to respond to IFN-signals. It is likely that pattern recognition receptors and downstream pathways activated by the mutant virus trigger antiviral defense mechanisms in an IFN-dependent and IFN-independent manner.",

            "text": "Whether the balance between low virulence and high immunogenicity is achieved in humans by 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants remains to be elucidated. Our studies in human HEK293 cells show increased susceptibility of DENV2 E217A mutant to IFN-\u03b2 in vitro, suggesting that DENV E217A mutants will be attenuated in humans as well. In the monkey immunization experiments, one monkey out of four in the high dose group experienced peak viremia of about 100 PFU, which is comparable to other live attenuated vaccine candidates [51]. Indeed, weak replication of the vaccine approach is desirable in order to induce a strong protective cellular immune response. Replication should be restricted enough to preclude onset of illness, whereas sub-clinical symptoms such as mild rash, transient leukopenia, and mildly elevated liver enzyme values are generally accepted [52]\u2013[54]. Furthermore, studies with murine hepatitis virus have shown that MTase mutants are highly attenuated in its natural host, induce IFN, which could further induce the immunogenicity of a vaccine, and are genetically stable in vivo\n[15]. Moreover, the replication level of WNV 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant in mice was largely decreased in the spleen, serum, or brain in comparison with the WT WNV infection. Intracranial inoculation of 1\u00d7105 PFU of 2\u2032-O-MTase mutant WNV did not cause any mortality and morbidity in mice, demonstrating the safety of this vaccine approach [14]. Taken together, these evidences demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of the MTase-mutant vaccine approach. We are currently working on the tetravalent formulation to develop the strategy towards a clinical application.",
