Thus, the natural coumarins play an important role in plant biochemistry and physiology. They act as antioxydants, enzyme inhibitors and precursors of toxic substances. They are also involved in the actions of plant growth hormones and growth regulators, the control over the respiration and photosynthesis, as well as in the defense against various infections [1]. Although most of the existing natural coumarins have been isolated from higher plants, some of them have been discovered in microorganisms, e.g., aminocoumarin antibiotics: Novobiocin, coumermycin A1 and chlorobiocin (produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces niveus) [2].",

Subsequent in situ reaction of the chromon with 4-hydroxycoumarin already present in excess in the reaction mixture gave dimeric coumarin derivatives 1\u201315 bearing an aryl substituent in the central methylene linker. In contrast, the chromone derivatives containing an ortho-substituted phenyl moiety (R1 = Cl, F, OH, OCH3) gave under spontaneous cyclization the fused benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16\u201320.

In the 1H spectrum of 1, 2, 4 and 10, which were dissolved in non-polar solvents, well resolved hydroxyl protons were observed in the range from \u03b4 11.3 to 11.5 ppm (see Experimental section for details). The strongly deshielded signals suggest that OH protons are most probably involved in hydrogen bond formation. In addition, two set of 1H-NMR signals were observed for H5 and H5\u201d protons which indicates a slight difference in magnetic environment for otherwise symmetrical moieties. Furthermore, hydroxyl protons, which were observed between \u03b4 11.8 and 12.3 ppm for benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16, 18 and 20, are most likely involved in hydrogen bonds.",

These observations suggested nonrestricted rotation along C*\u2013C1\u2032 bonds in 5 and 14. No NOEs indicative of relative orientations of individual heterocyclic moieties were observed for 20. Interestingly, benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16, 18 and 20 showed two sets of signals in the 1H spectrum for coumarin protons. One set of 1H signals (H5-H8 protons) exhibited broader line-widths with respect to multiplets attributed to H5\u201d-H8\u201d protons. This phenomenon was studied in more detail for 20 by variable temperature experiments in the range from 298 to 358 K. As an example, broad multiplet at \u03b4 8.00 ppm corresponding to H5 becomes sharper at higher temperatures (Figure 3). This suggests that rotation along C*\u2013C3 bond is restricted at lower temperatures, most likely due to formation of hydrogen bond between the C4-OH and C2\u201d carbonyl group (for enumeration of atoms c.f.\nFigure 2).",

            "text": "Crystals suitable for X-ray single crystal structure study were grown by slow evaporation from dichloromthane for 7 and 18, toluene for 9 and ethanol solution for 16. The intensities were collected on an Oxford Diffraction Xcalibur2 diffractometer with a Sapphire 3 CCD detector using graphite-monochromated MoK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71073 \u00c5) and \u03c9 scan-mode at 295 K. CrysAlisPro [22] program was used for data collection and processing. The intensities were corrected for absorption using the multi-scan absorption correction method [22]. The crystal structures were solved by direct methods [23] and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares calculations [23] based on F2 using the programs integrated in WinGX [24] program package. The hydrogen atoms attached to the O3 and O3\u2019 atoms in 7 and 9, O3A and O3B atoms in 16 and O3 atom in 18 were found in a difference Fourier map and are refined with O-H distance restraint of 0.82 \u00c5. All other hydrogen atoms were treated using appropriate riding models, with SHELXL97 defaults [23]. Fluorine atoms of trifluoromethyl group in 7 are heavily disordered and restraints on anisotropic displacement parameters were therefore used in their refinement. The C29 and C31 atoms of ethanol molecules in 16 are disordered with the site occupancy factors refined to 0.62(3)/0.38(3) and 0.52(3)/0.48(3) ratio, respectively. Details of crystal data, data collection and refinement parameters are given in Table 3. PLATON [25] program was used for structure analysis and molecular and crystal structure drawings preparation.

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 40, 8, 1.6 and 0.32 \u00b5M) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity of the compounds were evaluated against wild-type HIV-1 strain IIIB in MT-4 cell culture using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. MT-4 cells were suspended in culture medium at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL and infected with HIV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.02. Immediately after viral infection, 100 \u00b5L of the cell suspension was placed in each well of a flat-bottomed microtiter tray containing various concentrations of the test compounds. After four days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the number of viable cells was determined using the MTT method. Compounds were tested in parallel for cytotoxic effects in uninfected MT-4 cells.",

X-ray crystal structure analysis of 4-trifluoromethylphenyl- and 2-nitrophenyl derivatives 7 and 9 revealed intramolecular hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms of two 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties resulting in the formation of two eight-membered rings. Accordingly, two 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties in compounds 7 and 9 are anti-disposed. The 4-bromobenzylidene derivative of bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) (3) exerted some inhibitory activity against HSV-1 (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and HSV-1 TK- KOS (ACVr) in the range of 9\u201312 \u03bcM at minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) greater than 20 \u03bcM, whereas the compounds 4\u20136, 8, and 20 exhibited rather pronounced anti-Feline Herpes Virus activity (EC50 = 5\u20138.1 \u03bcM) but with MCC at only 4-7-fold higher than EC50 values.",
