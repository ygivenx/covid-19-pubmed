All viruses replicate by invading living cells, where they compete with host genes for the machinery and building blocks of life. In the process of copying itself, the virus often destroys the host cell, which can lead to disease. Viruses replicate exclusively within host cells, and onward transmission requires viral release. This is primarily achieved through two alternative mechanisms: lysis, where an infected cell dies and burst opens, so that all virions exit at once; or budding, where virions emerge gradually from a still living cell by appropriating part of the cell membrane, known as a viral envelope. Enveloped viruses cause diseases such as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, AIDS, H1N1 influenza, SARS and Lassa fever.",

            "text": "In eukaryotes, intracellular vesicle transport is mediated by vesicle transport proteins that are needed to move cargo between organelles and across the plasma membrane [4,5]. Four mechanisms have been proposed to explain how highly curved membranes and vesicles are formed. In the first, the membrane wraps around intrinsically curved proteins that have a high affinity for the membrane such as BAR (BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains [6] and dynamin [7]. In the second mechanism, locally high concentrations of lipid-binding protein can drive curvature by a crowding mechanism [8], although it is not clear how readily the necessary protein concentrations can be achieved in living cells. In the third mechanism, steric effects between proteins that occupy more space on one side of the membrane than the other could change the shape of the membrane [9]. In the fourth mechanism, bending is triggered by a conformational change, causing part of a protein to be inserted like a wedge in the membrane, stretching one side of the membrane more than the other and causing the membrane to curve in response. Examples of proteins that are believed to work in this manner include Sar1p [10], Epsins [11], ADP-ribosylation factors [11], which drive vesicle budding towards the cytoplasm, and the influenza virus M2 protein [12], which helps to cut new virus particles free of the cell.",

Table 1 summarizes what is currently known about the minimal requirements for formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) of enveloped viruses. VLP formation requires both budding and scission. In most enveloped viruses, the accumulation and budding steps are driven by matrix proteins and surface glycoproteins, whereas abscission is carried out by host ESCRT proteins or virus-encoded release proteins.\n",

Newly formed arenavirus buds are finally cleaved free of the cell with [14,16,42] or without assistance from ESCRT proteins [15,43]. The viral nucleoprotein NP may facilitate this process in some viruses [43,44]. Z is both necessary and sufficient for the release of arenavirus-like particles [15,16,42]. Z is heavily embedded in the inner face of the virus membrane [45], in a myristoylation-dependent manner [46]. Membrane-bound Z is also required to maintain a spherical virion shape [45].",

The accumulated flat mats of viral protein can extend over a much larger area than is required to form a virion [50]. This suggests that bud formation is unlikely to be driven directly by protein\u2013protein crowding, asymmetric protein distribution or intrinsic curvature of the virus proteins. Although structurally distinct from other virus matrix proteins [51\u201353], arenavirus Z and other matrix proteins have been reported to bind the membrane deeply enough to displace an estimated 5\u201310% of lipid molecules from the inner membrane face of fully assembled virus particles [45]. The immersion of Z in the inner side of the virus membrane suggests that arenaviruses may bud by deforming the membrane with wedge-like amphipathic protein domains. However, Z insertion into the cytoplasmic side of the membrane would be expected to produce an inward membrane curvature, which does not occur. Because none of the four proposed mechanisms is both consistent with structural data and expected to produce an outward bud, we favour a fifth mechanism.\n",

Calculations here are therefore based on the assumption that membrane curvature is induced by an asymmetric change in the amount of space GP and Z occupy in the two membrane leaflets. Several cellular [5,10,11] and viral [12] proteins have been proposed to induce membrane curvature in a similar way by inserting amphipathic protein domains into one face of the membrane.",

For the sake of simplicity, proteins are assumed to cover an axisymmetric region on a spherical cell. This assumption is supported by electron micrographs that show that Z forms a layer along the underside of the viral membrane in round virions (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S2). While Z can be difficult to see on individual images (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 upper panels), it becomes clearly visible when hundreds of virion images of a similar size are averaged (see the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 lower panels). The use of a mathematical model allows us to also investigate the potential for interactions between the proteins to stabilize the growing bulge by making the membrane rigid, effectively locking the curvature in place. Although rigidity has not been specifically demonstrated for arenaviruses, it is known in icosahedrally ordered enveloped viruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses [54\u201356], and can be inferred for some non-icosahedral viruses from the architecture of empty filamentous influenza virus capsids and immature coronaviruses [57]. Previous observations of enveloped viruses [12] show that virions form from growing bulges that eventually form spheres attached to the membrane by a narrow tube. Cellular endosomal sorting proteins have been implicated in the abscission stage of arenavirus budding [41], and are assumed here to finish the budding process by severing the connection between the virion and the cell.",

The addition of a viral-protein-induced increase in the membrane stiffness means buds can form more quickly in the presence of significant transmembrane pressure, in the sense that fully formed buds are produced from smaller areas of viral-protein-bound membrane. Although simulations here focus on spherical buds, the membrane model is compatible with the emergence of other (e.g. filamental) shaped virus particles budding from the membrane. Indeed, we would expect this to be the case in practice, when the distribution of curvature-inducing viral protein is not expected to be uniform or restricted to a simple circular patch. The membrane model is valid only to the point of pinch off, but the mechanism whereby the connection between the virion and cell are severed (believed to be executed by cellular endosomal sorting proteins) has already been established [41]. Calculations here are based on the explicit properties and measurements of arenavirus, but the models could potentially be applied to the budding of other pleomorphic viruses.",

In an isotonic state, the osmotic pressure on the cell balances, and the pressure difference is zero by definition. At other times, cells may experience negative pressure in a hypertonic solution (and even undergo pasmosis), or become turgid as a result of a hypotonic solution or cell movement. The latter may result from the formation of a pseudopodium, which can require a significant pressure differential [72] (see also [73]). Although pressure differences of the order of 10 N m\u22122 [73] to 102 N m\u22122 [72] have been recorded, in healthy mammals regulation (by, for example, antidiuretic hormone from the kidneys) ensures that any osmotic imbalance is corrected over a much shorter timescale than that taken for vesicles to form (of the order of minutes). Although it is therefore expected that the pressure differential will be low for much of the time, with cells seeking to be flaccid, this is not assumed to be true in what follows: the only prerequisite on p in the model is that it be not too large, in the sense , which is satisfied by pressures with magnitudes below O(10) N m\u22122 (table 3).",
