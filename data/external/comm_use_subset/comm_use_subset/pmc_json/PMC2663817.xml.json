Among impediments to effective control of this disease is increasing resistance to most available drugs [3]. New artemisinin-based combination therapies offer excellent efficacy, but resistance to most artemisinin partner drugs has already been seen [4], and resistance to artemisinins may be emerging [5]. The pipeline for development of other classes of effective antimalarials, especially compounds that act against novel biochemical targets, is limited. To facilitate development of such compounds, it is important to characterize the biochemical features and biological roles of new drug targets.",

These proteases are expressed sequentially across the life cycle of erythrocytic parasites, with expression of falcipain-2 beginning in early trophozoites followed by expression of falcipain-3 in late trophozoites and schizonts [7]. The proteases are hemoglobinases that reside in the food vacuole of intraerythrocytic parasites, where they degrade hemoglobin, in concert with other proteases [8], to provide the parasite with amino acids for growth and development [9]. Treatment of erythrocytic parasites with cysteine protease inhibitors or disruption of the falcipain-2 gene results in accumulation of undegraded hemoglobin in the food vacuole, confirming a role for this enzyme in hemoglobin hydrolysis [6], [10]. Disruption of the falcipain-3 gene could not be achieved, but the gene was readily replaced with a tagged functional copy, indicating that falcipain-3 is essential for survival of intraerythrocytic parasites [11]. These results support studies of falcipain inhibitors as new antimalarial agents.",

It has been described as an ordered pathway, with initial cleavage by aspartic proteases followed by action of other proteases, eventually leading to free amino acids [12]. However, falcipain inhibitors completely block hemoglobin hydrolysis by erythrocytic parasites [13], and falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 hydrolyze native hemoglobin under the biochemical conditions of the food vacuole [14], suggesting that falcipains also initiate hemoglobin hydrolysis in P. falciparum. To better characterize the roles of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, we evaluated activities of these proteases against a library of small peptide substrates, a series of larger peptides spanning the sequences of \u03b1 and \u03b2 globin, and intact human hemoglobin. Falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 demonstrated a marked preference for cleavage of small peptide substrates with P2 Leu, but the enzymes showed less specificity against larger peptides and intact hemoglobin, with hydrolysis at multiple sites. These results suggest that hemoglobin hydrolysis by P. falciparum is not a highly ordered process, but rather that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 rapidly cleave hemoglobin at multiple sites to facilitate rapid hydrolysis of this substrate.",

To best distinguish falcipain cleavage products from minor fragments contaminating synthetic peptides, the proteases and peptide substrates were incubated with 50% H2\n18O. With proteolytic cleavage, the C-terminal ends of the newly generated peptides, but not false products, bore 18O either by enzyme catalysis or isotope exchange [19], [20]. Peptides were incubated with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 for varied intervals, and reaction products were assessed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis. We used stringent criteria to distinguish newly generated peptides from false positive and ambiguous products, based on ratios of labeled to unlabeled peptides and frequencies of appearance at several time points. Multiple cleavage sites were identified for both falcipains (Fig. 2a\u2013d, top arrows). Considering the sequences most preferred in our positional scanning library analysis, cleavages by falcipain-2 were seen at 25 of 36 positions with P2 Leu and by falcipain-3 at 22 of 36 such positions. Analysis of the step-wise hydrolysis of peptides over time yielded a complex picture for both \u03b1 and \u03b2 globin and either falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 (Fig. 3). Identification of the most common amino acids at cleavage sites was, of course, influenced by the prevalence of different residues in hemoglobin. At the P2 position, Leu was most common, but cleavages of peptides with P2 Val and other amino acids were also well represented (Fig. 4). A more thorough analysis of cleavage for each amino acid at each P1\u20134 position is in supplementary material (Table S1; Figure S1). These experiments also showed that the most preferred P1\u2032 amino acids were Ala and Leu. However, this preference was modest, with cleavages demonstrated at sites with multiple different prime-side amino acids. At the P2\u2032 position Ala was slightly preferred. There was no particular amino acid preference at the P3\u2032 or P4\u2032 position.",

For simplicity, we therefore concentrated on identification of hemoglobin cleavage fragments after an extended incubation with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. Reactions were performed after incubation of hemoglobin with 50% H2\n18O, and the identities of hemoglobin cleavage fragments were characterized by LC-MS/MS.

We now present a detailed analysis of hydrolysis of short peptide substrates, 12-mer peptides encompassing \u03b1 and \u03b2 globin, and intact human hemoglobin by falcipain-2 and falcipain-3. We show that the proteases have distinct specificity for short peptide substrates with Leu at the P2 position, but that against larger substrates specificity is less marked. Indeed, the proteases rapidly cleaved globin peptides and intact hemoglobin at multiple different sequences. These results suggest that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 do not cleave host hemoglobin via an ordered process, but rather that the proteases efficiently cleave the substrate by rapid hydrolysis at many different sites on the protein.",

            "text": "We evaluated hydrolysis of small peptide combinatorial libraries by falcipains, a standard technique. Other proteases that have been evaluated in this manner include caspases [32], the serine protease granzyme b [32], [33], [34], a coronavirus cysteine protease [35], a tick asparaginyl endopeptidase [36], and human kalikreins [37]. Although this methodology is most useful for highly selective enzymes, valuable information can also be extracted from substrate profiles with enzymes that are quite promiscuous, as in the case of the falcipains and other papain family cysteine proteases [21]. Of note, we observed marked selectivity in P2 preference for falcipains using small peptide substrates. Hydrophobic amino acids at P2 were strongly preferered by falcipain-2 and falcipain-3, as seen with many other papain-family proteases [21]. However, the specific preference for a single amino acid, Leu, at P2, was more striking than the case for any of the 8 other papain-family proteases recently studied in the same manner [18]. Of the 8 other proteases, the next most specific enzyme was papain, with about 5-fold greater activity for peptides with Val at P2 than any other peptides. Other papain-family proteases not included in the prior survey appear to show a stronger preference for P2 Leu, notably the human proteases cathepsin K and cathepsin S [21]. As discussed in more detail below, we found that the striking preference for P2 Leu in small substrates did not predict specificity only for cleavage sites with P2 Leu in larger peptide or protein substrates. Nonetheless, this specificity has been seen also in small molecule inhibitors of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3; inhibitors with either Phe or Leu at P2 were effective, but typically activity improved \u223c10-fold for fluoromethyl ketones, vinyl sulfones, and aldehydes with P2 Leu [23], [38], [39]. Thus, although of limited utility in discriminating activity against native protein substrates, the elaboration of enzyme specificity using tetrapeptide scanning libraries provided accurate prediction of optimal small molecule inhibitors. Appreciation of the fine specificity of inhibition of falcipains is contributing to drug discovery efforts directed against these proteases [6].",

            "text": "Ordered pathways for the hydrolysis of hemoglobin have been demonstrated in studies with isolated aspartic proteases from two parasites that hydrolyze this substrate, schistosome worms that degrade hemoglobin extracellularly [44] and malaria parasites that degrade hemoglobin in an intracellular acidic organelle [12]. However, prior attempts to map out pathways of hemoglobin hydrolysis for cysteine proteases of schistosomes or malaria parasites have been unsuccessful due to an inability to identify the ordered generation of cleavage fragments (Shenai BR, Sajid M, and Rosenthal PJ, unpublished observations). A key goal of the present study was to more rigorously test the hypothesis that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 indeed hydrolyze hemoglobin through an ordered pathway of cleavage events and, in any event, to identify globin peptide and hemoglobin cleavage fragments after incubation with falcipains. Despite rigorous filtering to identify only bona fide cleavage fragments, we found that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 cleaved hemoglobin simultaneously (within our limits of analysis) at many sites. Thus, the enzymes appear to degrade hemoglobin not via an ordered hydrolytic pathway, but through rapid hydrolysis of multiple sites. This result is consistent with known features of other papain-family cysteine proteases, which also have quite broad specificity against protein substrates [21]. Indeed, the prototype enzyme papain is used in a number of industrial applications that take advantage of its broad substrate specificity. Lysosomal cysteine proteases similarly demonstrate broad specificity, and appear to be responsible for extensive proteolytic activity in this organelle [21]. In malaria parasites, where the food vacuole appears to serve as the homolog of the lysosome, and where hemoglobin appears to be the primary proteolytic substrate [12], it seems likely that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are responsible for the bulk of cleavages that reduce hemoglobin from a complex tetramer to single amino acids. Additional proteases, notably plasmepsin I\u2013IV [12], [45], dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I [46], [47] and falcilysin [48], [49], also appear to contribute to the efficient hydrolysis of hemoglobin in the food vacuole, and the presence of multiple proteases of multiple classes suggests a degree of redundancy in this process [9]. Despite the presence of multiple proteases in the food vacuole, it is noteworthy that treatment of cultured parasites with specific inhibitors of cysteine proteases fully blocked the hydrolysis of hemoglobin, highlighting the key role for the falcipains in this process [22]. Knockout of plasmepsins I\u2013IV, the 4 known food vacuole plasmepsins, was not lethal to P. falciparum (although parasites with knockout of all four food vacuole plasmepsins demonstrated abnormal development) [50], [51]. In contrast, knockout of either falcipain-3 [11] or dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I [46] appears to be lethal, arguing for essential functions for these enzymes, although it is not known if the essential functions are hydrolysis of hemoglobin. Of note, it has recently also been shown that the activation of food vacuole plasmepsins is primarily mediated by falcipains, offering further evidence of a primary role for falcipains in mediating the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by erythrocytic P. falciparum parasites [52].",

Removal of the insertion from falcipain-2 rendered a protease that remained active against peptide substrates, but could not hydrolyze hemoglobin [26]. This feature of the falcipains likely facilitates particularly efficient hydrolysis of hemoglobin and may contribute to the ability of the proteases to cleave hemoglobin at multiple sites. However, it is difficult to predict interaction between the protease and substrate based on known structures [28], [29], as once initial cleavages of hemoglobin take place, the structure of hemoglobin will be altered, and multiple peptide bonds will presumably be accessible to cleavage by the falcipains.",

This analysis identified a series of hemoglobin cleavage fragments, with cleavage sites at mean intervals of 8.4 amino acids. Comparison of identified cleavage sites from the prior analysis of food vacuole extracts with our analysis of cleavage by recombinant falcipains identified many shared cleavage sites, but also cleavages identified only after incubation with food vacuole extract or only after incubation with recombinant falcipains. Specifically, only 15 of 37 cleavages identified in the prior study after incubation with food vacuole extracts were seen after incubation with falcipain-2 or falcipain-3. Therefore, some hemoglobin cleavages appeared to be generated uniquely by proteases other than the falcipains. However, considering both our globin peptides and intact hemoglobin results, we observed over 100 different cleavage sites within hemoglobin, with 90 of these not seen after incubation with food vacuole extract. Some falcipain activity may have been missed in studies of vacuole extracts due to chosen assay conditions, the presence of enzyme inhibitors in extracts, or loss of enzymes during sample preparation. In any event, our new results suggest that, although a diverse set of proteases is likely required for optimal hydrolysis of hemoglobin, the sequential expression of falcipain-2 in early trophozoites and then falcipain-3 in late trophozoites and schizonts [7] provides potent hemoglobinolytic activity for erythrocytic P. falciparum parasites.",

            "text": "Our study has important limitations. First, the precise analysis of cleavage of globin peptides or hemoglobin by falcipains proved to be technically very challenging. Analysis of products after incubations of globin peptides with the proteases identified many products, suggesting the presence of contaminating fragments in commercial peptides. We therefore used 18O labeling and assessments for reproducibility over time to identify genuine cleavage fragments. However, this approach necessarily involved the establishment of arbitrary filtering criteria, and may have inappropriately excluded some cleavage sites and/or included false cleavage sites. Second, analysis of cleavage of intact hemoglobin was cost- and labor-intensive, limiting our ability to evaluate a broad range of hydrolytic time points. Thus, our ability to identify any single hemoglobin cleavage site for falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 from our studies is somewhat limited, although cleavages seen consistently with both falcipains at multiple time points and with both peptide and intact hemoglobin substrates are very likely to represent true biological cleavage sites. Third, our study used ultrafiltration to isolate peptide cleavage fragments generated from intact hemoglobin. This procedure might lead to selective loss of certain peptides. To investigate that possibility, we previously analyzed tryptic digests of proteins prior to and after ultrafiltration, and we did not observe significant differences between the samples (Hardt, M., unpublished observation). Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that certain peptides might have been lost due to this separation technology, but, based on our overall sequence coverage of hemoglobin, this potential loss appeared to be minimal. In any event, our overall result is clear: falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are capable of rapid hydrolysis of hemoglobin at multiple cleavage sites.",
