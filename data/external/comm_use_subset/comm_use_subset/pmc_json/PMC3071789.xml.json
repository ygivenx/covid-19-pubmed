            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus (PHEV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which causes porcine encephalomyelitis. PHEV predominantly affects 1-3 week-old piglets[1], with clinical piglets vomiting, exhaustion and obvious neurological symptoms as the main feature. The mortality rate is up to 20-100%[2]. Since 1958, when the disease broke out in the Canadian province of Ontario for the first time[3], many countries have reported about it. Serological test results proved that it is common for the pigs to be infected by PHEV[4,5], and the disease may have spread worldwide. In August 2006, the disease broke out in part of the pig farms in Argentina, resulting to 1226 deaths, with the morbidity rate up to 52.6%[1]. In China, an PHEV infection has been reported occurring in a pig farm in Beijing as early as in 1985, followed with reports from Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Taiwan, etc. The large-scale epidemics of HEV occurred in Taiwan in 1994 had a fatality rate of almost 100%[6], resulting to serious economic losses. Serological survey conducted by foreign scholars revealed that PHEV infection in pigs is very common, with a worldwide distribution[4,5].",

The sows mainly showed elevated body temperature and loss of appetite. Their early clinical manifestations were sneezing, coughing, regurgitating, vomiting and spitting up milk. Sick piglets often stayed together, had arched backs and did not like to walk. During late stages of the disease, they suffered from physical deterioration. Piglets with poor resistance would suffer from severe dehydration. Exhibiting difficulty in breathing and cyanosis, they would sink into comas and die. Piglets with better resistance would lose their appetite and soon became emaciated and died. In the current study, 28 piglets died within 20 days of birth. The only 10 surviving piglets were sent to the animal facility of our lab to be raised separately. Their clinical signs were significant increase of body temperature, lethargy, crowding together, eyes half-closed or lying on the ground showing sleepiness and loss of appetite. Nervous system signs of the diseased pigs included nervous whole body muscle convulsions, taking a dog-sitting position and weakness/fainting. During the late stage, diseased pigs wobbled and could not stand, their noses and feet were cyanotic and they discharged watery feces. Some of them lost their eyesight or had opisthotonos and nystagmus. Finally, they experienced breathing problems, lay on their sides exhausted and vomited. The only 10 surviving pigs sent to our lab for examination died within 3 days; the death rate of the piglets was 100%.",

In 1984, in a pig farm on the outskirts of Beijing, an HEV infection in the hybrid progenies of imported Landrace, Duroc, and Hampshire pigs was the first case reported in mainland China[11]. In 1985, an HEV infection in the progenies of American Duroc and Hampshire lean pigs occurred at a pig farm in Jilin Province. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics reported in that case were very similar to the HEV cases reported in Canada and United States in the 1980 s [12].

Based on this theory, \"sub-infection\" may prevent the disease. In the \"sub-infection\" method, at least one month before giving birth, the sows have contact with diseased pigs or attenuated virus by spray or muscular injection to immunize the sows; then, the young piglets can be protected through the antibodies in the colostrum.
