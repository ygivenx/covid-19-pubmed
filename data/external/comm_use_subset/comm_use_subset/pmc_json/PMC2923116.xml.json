            "text": "Common cold is the most prevalent contagious viral disease in humans. It is caused by a variety of viral pathogens with human rhinoviruses (HRV) being the most abundant ones. Affecting the upper respiratory system, symptoms like blocked nose, cough and sneezing are most common [1,2]. The socioeconomic losses associated with viral respiratory tract infections, however, are huge [3,4] with enormous direct and indirect costs for our health care system [5]. Colds also pose a threat for the very young or old, ailing and/or high risk groups like immunocompromised patients, COPD patients, asthmatics or lung transplant recipients [1,6]. A wide range of remedies is sold on prescription and over the counter, but evidence-based medicine systematic reviews conclude that there is still no reliable prevention or cure available and potential serious side effects of popular products also have to be considered. Given the multiple causes of common cold, the Cochrane collaboration suggested to focus future research efforts on non virus-specific compounds [7]. Effective formulations containing antiviral agents are needed for the safe and efficacious treatment of common cold symptoms and the containment of viral propagation. Potential side effects should also be minimal due to the usually nonhazardous nature of the indication.",

Spray solutions were clear, colourless, odourless and free of particles. Verum and placebo nasal sprays were identical in shape, size and colour to allow a double-blind design, and were randomized at the CRO. Before administration, the spray was to be shaken and primed until a fine mist was delivered. One spray application of 140 \u03bcl was delivered to each nostril 3 \u00d7/day for 4 days. On day 1, the first application was taken at study entry (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), the next two applications of the spray were equally spaced through remaining waking hours on day 1. Nasal spray applications on days 2/3/4 were administered equally spaced during waking hours. To control compliance with the study protocol, returned spray bottles were weighted and weights compared to weights on dispensing, thereby evaluating the weight of medication taken over the study period. Subject No. 10 (placebo) missed the first dose on day 1 and 4, the third dose on day 2, and therefore took only 75% of planned doses. All other subjects had 100% compliance according to the diary documentation. In total, 99.3% compliance was reached in this study. Dependent on the time point of inclusion in the study, the expected range of difference in weights was between 2.80 g and 3.36 g. Mean difference in the verum group was 3.12 g (\u00b1 0.84 g), and in placebo group 3.84 g (\u00b1 1.85 g) concluding that more placebo than verum doses were administered.

Assays were performed using QiAamp Viral RNA Mini and Qiagen QuantiFast Probe PCR Kits (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany), RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit (Pathofinder, Maastricht, the Netherlands) and Real Time PCR 7900 HT Sequence Detection (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

In brief, 140 \u03bcl samples were thawed on ice, transferred to 560 \u03bcl Buffer AVL with carrier RNA, spiked with 10 \u03bcl internal control, and eluated RNA was stored at -20\u00b0C for a maximum of 4 hours until transfer to -80\u00b0C.

Since the number of virus positive-tested subjects was low, further confirmation of this result is needed. It cannot be ruled out that some patients were infected with respiratory viruses that were not tested or were below the detection limit. However, this result in patients further supports earlier in-vitro findings of the antiviral effect against human rhinoviruses [10] and against other viruses such a papillomaviruses or dengue virus [11,13]. The results of this study might encourage clinical developments for these viruses as well.",

In nasal lavage samples the presence of immune mediators was tested. While the majority of the growth factors and cytokines were expressed below the detection limit, 11 mediators including IL-8, IP10, and GRO were easily detectable. It is interesting to note that the expression of the majority of the molecules (FGF-2, Fractalkine, GRO, G-CSF, IL-8, IL-1\u03b1, IP-10, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b12) was reduced in the Iota-Carrageenan group upon treatment, while IL-1 receptor antagonist and IL-12p40 were increased. IL-1 receptor antagonist is regarded as counter-acting molecule to IL-1. The role of IL-12p40 during a respiratory infection in humans is not fully understood. A recent study suggested suggest that endogenous IL-12p40 is essential for inhibition of airway hyperresponsiveness and peribronchial fibrosis, but not eosinophilic inflammation, in a murine asthma model with prolonged antigen exposures [20].",

In addition, it is reported that the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the course of a common cold may worsen pre-existing co-morbidities such as asthma or COPD [6,21,22].
