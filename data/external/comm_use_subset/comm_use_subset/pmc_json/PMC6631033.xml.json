            "text": "Animal viruses may be split into transmissible and persistent viruses. It has been proposed that transmissible viruses correlate with replication and virulence and that virus persistence instead permits a lower transmission rate [1]. This insight builds on earlier work suggesting that virus persistence may pave the way for virus-host symbiosis [2]. Viruses are considered essential agents within the roots and stems of the tree of life [3]. For example, RNA viruses in vertebrates tend to broadly follow the evolutionary history of their hosts that began in the ocean and extended for hundreds of millions of years [4]. The symbiotic virus-host relationships can take many forms, from antagonistic to mutualistic, and viruses, like other symbionts, lie on a continuum that can shift with environmental changes [5].",

Virus transmission may be considered to present the backbone of virus ecology, determining the viruses selected for. Unfortunately, the current classification of animal viruses emphasizes the importance of virus genomic architecture and the host cell infection cycle [6]. Less attention is given to why and how virus fitness results from the virus transmission success. For example, an animal virus may become established in the upper respiratory tract and transmit via aerosols to the next host. An enteric virus features a fecal-oral cycle. A skin virus may transmit on the basis of touch. A virus colonizing the distal urogenital tract may transmit during sexual contact. Hence, an analysis of the virus transmission success requires a consideration of the overt clinical signs of infection, the gross pathology, the matching virus shedding profile, and of the ensuing modes of transmission.",

In vertebrate hosts the more vital organ systems are shielded off from external aggressors, small or large. It may be assumed that also the host immune defenses are structured to ensure that harmful viral pathogens remain confined to the outer-body environment, the epithelia. Epithelial viruses interface with the external environment and respond to the variation encountered here. Opposingly, infiltrative viruses establish in the inner-body environment and are expected to evolve towards a more intimate virus-host relationship. Given that the virus-host relationship changes with the position of the virus in the outer- to inner-body continuum the analysis focuses on the extent of virus host-body infiltration.",

This may be inferred from the dichotomy in the release of viruses from epithelial cells. Apart from direct cell-to-cell transmission [7], viruses may be released from the apical cell surface and so end-up in the outer-body environment. These viruses colonize mucosae and skin. In contrast, viruses released from the basolateral cell surface infiltrate underlying tissues. These viruses end-up in the lymph drainage, enter the blood circulation and so may infect any of the internal organs. Infiltration of and establishment in the inner-body environment may translate in additional, non-epithelial transmission modes. For example, virus establishment in the reproductive organs may translate in intrauterine or lactogenic transmission [8]. In birds, virus may be shed into yolk or albumen and so transmit vertically [9]. Virus circulation in the bloodstream may enable virus transmission via needles or arthropod vectors [10].",

It is assumed that the nature of the virus-host interaction changes with the position of the virus in the outer- to inner-body continuum. The study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses. The rationale for selecting the world main livestock viruses relates to the host damaging effects of these pathogens, the overt clinical signs and gross pathology, translating in prominent virus shedding and obvious virus transmission modes. Moreover, because of the major economic impact of these diseases, the causative viruses and the corresponding infection-transmission dynamics have been well studied.",

As a first step, the one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 livestock viruses for the four ecological variables were examined in more detail. The scores are shown in Figure S1b. The variables comprise the extent of virus host-body infiltration, the length of the infection period, the infection severity level, and the virus environmental survival rate. The one-to-three infiltration score reflects the organ systems involvement in infection-transmission and concerns, respectively, virus transmission based on the involvement of the epithelia, transmission involving epithelia and internal organs, and transmission involving just internal organs. The score for the length of the infection period reflects, respectively, acute, acute plus persistent, and persistent infections. Likewise, the score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. The score for the virus environmental survival rate refers to the number of days that the virus remains infective outside the host-body, ranging from up to three, three to ten, to over ten days. With one exception, the variables did not increase or decrease in value together. Just the association between the extent of virus host-body infiltration and the length of the infection period was found to be monotonic. Spearman correlation yielded an R = 0.58 and p < 0.0005. It was thus found that viruses infiltrating internal organs either cause persistent infections or a combination of acute and persistent infections. Conversely, persistent viruses either colonize internal organs or a combination of internal organs and epithelia. Hence, the length of the infection period appears to present a measure for the extent of virus host-body infiltration. ",

The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae, the Picornaviridae and the Poxviridae was in part modulated also by the internal organ systems. The transmission of the viruses belonging to the Arteriviridae, the Flaviviridae, the Herpesviridae, plus also the single infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), resulted from epithelial modes as well as internal organ systems involvement. Finally, the transmission of the single bluetongue virus (BTV) plus the viruses belonging to the Retroviridae family either reflected the involvement of epithelia plus internal organ systems or of just internal organ systems. A Spearman correlation of the A\u2013D virus family specific infiltration ranking and the length of the infection period scores yielded an R = 0.71 and p = 0.

Virus infiltration of immune and circulatory systems associated with iatrogenic transmission modes. Virus circulation in the bloodstream facilitated arthropod borne transmission.

Additional correlations concerned virus host tropism and the four virus ecological variable scores, as well as virus genome type, and the four virus ecological variable scores.
