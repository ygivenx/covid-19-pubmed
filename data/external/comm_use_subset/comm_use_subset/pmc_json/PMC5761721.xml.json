            "text": "Microtubule severing enzymes are a family of AAA-ATPase proteins that participate in fundamental cellular processes such as mitosis, ciliary biogenesis and growth cone motility. In neurons this family is known to control such processes as axonal elongation1 and synaptic development.2 In addition, mutations in microtubule severing enzyme genes SPG4, KATNB1 and KATNAL2 are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, cerebral malformations and autism, respectively,3, 4, 5, 6 and mutations in Fign cause a range of phenotypes in mice.7 Currently the microtubule severing enzyme KATNAL1 is poorly characterised and it is not yet understood how the enzyme functions in the nervous system. Recent evidence from genetic characterisation of human patients suggests that haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1 is linked with a number of symptoms including intellectual disability (ID) and craniofacial dysmorphologies.8, 9 It is also notable that a very rare KATNAL1 mutation has been associated with schizophrenia10 (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/genebook.cgi?user=guest&cmd=verb-gene&tbox=KATNAL1) and that Peters syndrome and autism have both been associated with the chromosomal region containing the KATNAL1 locus.11, 12 Although such association studies strongly suggest that KATNAL1 plays a fundamental role in the central nervous system (CNS), additional studies using cellular or animals models are required to understand how the gene may be causative for disease. Here we present the first study describing neural and behavioural deficits associated with a loss of function allele of Katnal1 in the mouse. This mutant mouse line was independently identified in two parallel phenotyping screens, which demonstrated that mutant mice showed both male sterility and circadian phenotypes. Subsequent behavioural investigations demonstrated that this mutation is associated with anxiety and memory deficits. Underlying these behavioural phenotypes, we identified histopathological abnormalities in the brains of Katnal11H/1H mutants, including disordered cellular layers in the hippocampus and cortex and substantially larger ventricles. Further investigations demonstrated that Katnal11H/1H mice show neuronal migration and ciliary function deficits suggesting KATNAL1 plays an essential role in these processes. These findings are the first to our knowledge to conclusively show that mutations in Katnal1 lead to behavioural and neuronal disturbances and provide insight regarding the clinical associations that have been linked to the gene.",

This mutant allele was designated Katnal11H, and results in a leucine to valine substitution at residue 286 of the protein. In vitro functional analysis demonstrated that the mutation is a recessive loss-of-function allele.23 3D modelling of the protein suggests that this loss of function is due to hydrophobic changes in the AAA domain of the enzyme (Supplementary Figure S1).

            "text": "Both working memory and spatial memory were significantly poorer in Katnal11H/1H mice, as evidenced by reduced spontaneous alternations in a T-maze (Figure 2a) and in the Morris water maze where mutants take longer to find the platform in acquisition trials (Figure 2b), show poorer improvements in the latency to find the platform (Figure 2c) and spend less time in the target quadrant than wild types (Figure 2d). Anxiety and locomotor activity was assessed by monitoring activity in an open field arena. Here Katnal11H/1H animals spent a higher proportion of time in the centre of the arena (Figure 2e) and travelled over longer distances (Figure 2f) compared to wild-types. To differentiate between activity and anxiety changes in the open field arena we analysed activity in both the anxiogenic centre and the anxiolytic periphery of the arena. This analysis demonstrated that Katnal11H/1H animals showed increased activity in both regions of the open field (distance travelled in centre of open field: wild type=164\u00b112 m, Katnal11H/1H=243\u00b120 m, P=0.02; distance travelled in periphery of open field: wild type=4.3\u00b10.2 m, Katnal11H/1H=6\u00b10.3 m, P=0.004). Conversely when mouse activity was recorded in the home cage, we found no difference between genotypes (distance travelled over 24 h: wild type=399\u00b177 m, Katnal11H/1H=418\u00b141 m, P=0.833) suggesting that the former activity differences were due to the novel environment of the open field rather than generalised hyperactivity in Katnal11H/1H animals. Finally, in certain conditions (such as maternal separation) mice emit ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs). To test whether Katnal11H/1H animals vocalised differently to wild types, we separated pups at postnatal days 7\u20138 (the age at which mice show peak of USV emission24) and recorded their USVs. In these tests, compared to wild types, Katnal11H/1H pups produced fewer (Figure 2g) and shorter (Figure 2h) vocalisations, containing fewer phrases (Figure 2i).",

To confirm these cortical layer differences, immunofluorescence was performed using the cortical layer markers calbindin (layers 2/3 and 5; Figures 3f and g), CUX1 (layers 2/3 and 4; Figures 3i and j), FOXP2 (layer 6a) and CTGF (layer 6b) (Figures 3l and m). Quantification of fluorescence intensity demonstrated that in Katnal11H/1H cortex both calbindin and CUX1 labelling was more intense closer to the cortical surface, which is consistent with the reduction in the size of layer 1 (two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), interaction factors \u2018genotype X distance of fluorescence from cortical surface\u2019, calbindin: F(75,988)=16.8, P<0.0005; CUX1: F(93,372=2.17, P=0.001; Figures 3h and k). Similar quantification revealed that FOXP2 labelling extended further from layer 6b (as labelled by CTGF) in the Katnal11H/1H cortex, which is consistent with an increase in the size of layer 6 (two-way ANOVA, interaction factors \u2018genotype X distance of fluorescence from CTGF labelling:\u2019 F(93,372)=1.32, P=0.038; Figure 3n). Finally, three dimensional models of the ventricular system were constructed from brain micro-computed tomography scans (Figures 3o and p). Volumetric analysis revealed that Katnal11H/1H mice had substantially larger ventricles than wild types (Figure 3q).",

At both ages Katnal11H/1H animals had greater numbers of labelled neurons in bins close to the cortical surface (two-way ANOVA, interaction factors \u2018genotype X bin\u2019: E13 brains; F(9,80)=2.361, P=0.02.

These results demonstrate a defect in neuronal migration during development, with the final location of Katnal11H/1H neurons positioned closer to the cortical surface compared to wild type. To confirm these results we used a Boyden chamber19 and performed in vitro neuronal migration analysis in E13.5 primary cortical neuronal cultures. Here we found that a greater proportion of Katnal11H/1H cortical neurons migrated to the base of the cell culture insert compared to wildtype controls (Supplementary Figure S3). Since in both BrdU labelling and the Boyden assay neurons from Katnal11H/1H animals migrated further than those of wild-type littermates, these results suggest that Katnal11H/1H cortical neurons show defects in the termination of cortical neuronal migration.",

We found that the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) of Katnal11H/1H animals was significantly attenuated compared to wild-type (CBF: wildtype=22.39\u00b10.94 Hz, Katnal11H/1H=14.25\u00b10.92 Hz, P=0.0001; Figure 5a, Supplementary Movies S1). This reduction in CBF in Katnal11H/1H animals was also associated with an increased proportion of cilia with an abnormal beat pattern (ciliary dyskinesia) (proportion of dyskinetic cilia: wild type=17%, Katnal11H/1H=75%) (Figure 5b and Supplementary Movies S1). Visual inspection of the cilia identified a number of ciliary abnormalities such as a swollen ciliary tip (Supplementary Movie S3) or extremely long cilia (Supplementary Movie S4) scattered throughout the field of cilia in Katnal11H/1H ventricles. These abnormalities were observed in approximately 25% of Katnal11H/1H brain slices. The abnormal cilia always showed a dyskinetic beat pattern and lower beat frequency. To further investigate ciliary morphology we performed scanning electron microscopy upon the ependymal lining of the lateral ventricles of both Katnal11H/1H (n=3) and wild-type animals (n=3; Figures 5c and d). Cilia measurements showed no significant differences in average cilia length between genotypes (average cilia length: wild type=6.22\u00b10.86 \u03bcm, Katnal11H/1H=6.54\u00b10.94 Hz, P=0.303). However in Katnal11H/1H samples we noted the presence of both long and short cilia (Figures 5e and f; defined as two standard deviations longer or shorter than the average cilia length) that were not present in wild-type samples. In addition, inspection of Katnal11H/1H cilia identified ciliary abnormalities including bifurcated cilia (Figure 5g), abnormal kinks and bends in the cilia (Figure 5h) and swellings along the length of the cilia (Figure 5i). Transmission electron microscopy of ependymal cilia found that vesicular aggregates were present within the ciliary swellings described above (Figure 5j). Although these abnormalities were present in only a small proportion (<1%) of Katnal11H/1H cilia, they were notably absent from wild-type cilia.",

However subsequent ex vivo experiments using SCN slices of animals carrying the PER2::LUC reporter gene demonstrated no defects in SCN cellular rhythms, suggesting that the core circadian clock was unperturbed by the mutation. Phenotypes in circadian running wheel rhythms that are not associated with changes to the core clock mechanism have also been reported in mouse models of schizophrenia.25 Here it has been suggested that the wheel running changes observed are the result in defects in output pathways from the SCN circadian clock. Similarly, in Katnal11H/1H mice we hypothesise that the defects we demonstrate in neuronal anatomy and neuronal morphology may disrupt output signals from the SCN. Alternatively given that various neuropeptides such as oxytocin are secreted in a circadian manner from ependymal cells lining the third ventricle of the brain,26 altered ventricular morphology and ciliary function in Katnal11H/1H mice may disrupt the circulation of factors secreted by the ciliated ventricular ependymal cells and contribute to the disruption of the behavioural rhythms observed.",

Currently the phenotypes described are limited to motor dysfunction in mice lacking the Spg4 gene27 and head shaking and circling in the Fign mutant.7, 28, 29 In contrast, here we demonstrate that loss of function of Katnal1 is associated with a range of behavioural phenotypes, including changes in circadian activity, poor learning and memory, hyperactivity in a novel environment (the open field) and deficits in USVs. Notably the learning and memory, anxiety and vocalisation phenotypes reprise the clinical symptoms of ID, increased anxiety in novel situations and delays in language acquisition reported in human patients who carry microdeletions incorporating haploinsufficiency of KATNAL1.8, 9 While it is also worth noting that mutant mice spend more time the centre of the open field than wild types (implying that Katnal11H/1H animals show reduced anxiety), we suggest that this result is confounded by the hyperactivity in novel environments phenotype we also describe in mutant mice. This observation is backed up by the fact that mutant animals showed increased activity in all regions of the open field rather than just the anxiolytic periphery. Here we also highlight defects in Katnal11H/1H mice such as compromised neuronal migration and morphology which may underpin such phenotypes. In Drosophila, the homologue of Katnal1 (kat-60L1) has been demonstrated to play a critical role in neuronal morphology during development,30 however the data that we present here is the first to demonstrate a similar phenotype in mammals and furthermore suggests how subtle perturbations to KATNAL1 function may contribute to specific neural and behavioural conditions. For example, defects in neuronal migration, synaptic spines and neuronal morphology such as those we have demonstrated here, have been suggested to underpin ID in conditions such as lissencephaly,18 Down\u2019s syndrome31 and Rett syndrome.32 While we are not suggesting that Katnal1 is causative for these conditions, similarities in symptoms and neuronal phenotypes between these conditions and those linked to Katnal1 dysfunction should be appreciated. Furthermore a rare mutation in KATNAL1 has been associated with schizophrenia10 (http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/~spurcell/genebook/genebook.cgi?user=guest&cmd=verb-gene&tbox=KATNAL1) and KATNAL1 has been shown to interact with the schizophrenia associated gene DISC1.33 In line with these observations we note that increases in ventricular volume and reductions in synaptic spines have been reported in schizophrenic patients34, 35 and our data demonstrates the same phenotypes in Katnal11H/1H mice. Thus the range of phenotypes associated with defects in the function of Katnal1 strongly suggests that the gene should be considered in the pathology of disorders such as ID and schizophrenia.",

While the human patients were all heterozygous for the Katnal1 deletion, we found no phenotype in heterozygous mutant mice (data not shown) suggesting that while haploinsufficiency is causative for phenotypes in humans, mice require complete loss of KATNAL1 function to show similar effects. A similar discrepancy between humans and mice has also been noted for the intellectual disability candidate gene CTNNB1.17 While heterozygous loss of function mutations in CTNNB1 are causative for intellectual disability in humans, conditional knock outs for CTNNB1 have no reported behavioural or craniofacial phenotypes.36, 37 These differences demonstrate that while mouse models of intellectual disability are of great use in our understanding of the causative mechanisms which underlie the condition, there are still genetic and neurodevelopmental differences between species which also must be taken into account. We also note that while the Katnal11H mutation shows a loss of catalytic function in both HEK293 cells and Sertoli cells,23 this loss of function has not been verified in neuronal cells. However, given that our data demonstrates that the Katnal11H mutation lies in an essential catalytic domain and that we show neuronal phenotypes in Katnal11H/1H mice, we would expect to see the same loss of catalytic function in neurons.",

Ciliary disruptions in humans (ciliopathies) include Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndrome.38 While there is currently limited data available regarding the behavioural phenotypes of mouse models of ciliopathies, we note that ciliary dysfunction in mice has been linked with learning and memory39 and vocalisation phenotypes,40 both of which were disturbed in the Katnal11H/1H mice described here. It is also notable that the neuronal migration and enlarged ventricle phenotypes that we describe in Katnal11H/1H mice recapitulate features associated with known ciliopathy gene mutations.41, 42, 43, 44 Furthermore in Bardet-Biedl syndrome mouse models ciliary defects such as reduced CBF45 and structural defects such as abnormal lengthening and swellings along their length41 have been described, that are similar to those we describe in Katnal11H/1H mice. There is strong evidence that ciliopathy associated genes play a number of roles in neuronal development by affecting processes such as progenitor proliferation or maintenance of the radial glia scaffold.43 However it is also clear that defects in microtubule organisation also affect synaptic structure.2 At present it is difficult to disentangle the relative contributions of defects in microtubule severing and ciliary abnormalities to the overall phenotypes we observe in Katnal11H/1H mice. Further investigations are required to clarify the impacts of these two processes. However it is notable that while defects in cilia structure may contribute to the phenotypes we describe in Katnal11H/1H mice, they are far less prominent in Katnal11H/1H mice than in other mouse ciliopathy models,41 suggesting that the ciliary component of KATNAL1 dysfunction may be mild compared to other ciliopathies. Similarly while hydrocephalus has been suggested to be a component of some ciliopathy mouse models,46\nKatnal11H/1H mice showed only increased ventricle size rather than an increased incidence of hydrocephalus, further suggesting the ciliary defects in these animals are mild compared to other ciliopathies.",
