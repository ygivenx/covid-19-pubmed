It also causes non-suppurative sequelae, including acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis and acute arthritis [1]. Scarlet fever, characterized by a sore throat, skin rash and strawberry tongue, is most prevalent in school children aged four to seven years old. This disease was listed as a notifiable disease in Taiwan until 2007; as such, all cases of scarlet fever had to be reported to the public heath department. According to our records, however, only 9% of the medical centers, regional hospitals and district hospitals in central Taiwan reported cases of scarlet fever to the health authorities between 1996 and 1999. The number of scarlet fever cases is therefore likely to be significantly underreported. Scarlet fever outbreaks frequently occur in young children at day-care centers, kindergartens and elementary schools [2,3] and also occur in adults upon exposure to contaminated food [4].",

In a previous study, we used emm (gene of M protein) sequencing [5], vir typing [6] and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing to analyze a collection of streptococcal isolates from scarlet fever patients and used these data to build a DNA fingerprint and emm sequence database for long-term disease surveillance [7]. Vir typing has since been abandoned in our lab because it has lower discriminatory power than PFGE and the protocol is difficult to standardize with conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. In contrast, the PFGE protocol for S. pyogenes has been standardized in our laboratory, and a second enzyme, SgrAI, has been found to replace SmaI for analysis of strains with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion [7]. Since PFGE is highly discriminative and emm sequencing provides unambiguous sequence information regarding emm type, we adopted these two genotyping methods to characterize streptococcal isolates and build a Streptococcus pyogenes DNA fingerprint and sequence database for the long-term study of scarlet fever and other streptococcal diseases.",

Nationwide information for all notifiable diseases has been systematically collected since 2000. For accurate analysis, the number of confirmed scarlet fever cases was adjusted by multiplying the number of reported cases and the specimen positive rate. The total, adjusted number of confirmed cases throughout the whole country increased from 716 cases in 2000 to 1,258 in 2002, but dramatically dropped to 771 in 2003 (Table 1). This number increased again in 2004 and, in 2005, reached the high levels seen in 2002. However, the number of cases slightly declined again in 2006. In central Taiwan, the epidemiological trend was similar to the national profile, but fluctuated more dramatically between 2000 and 2004. While the number of scarlet fever cases was 142 in 2000, this number doubled in 2002 but then dropped in 2003 to the levels seen in 2000 (Table 1).

However, there was a remarkable decrease in the number of cases in the 6th and 7th weeks (Figure 1B). This decrease may be due to the long holiday of the traditional lunar New Year and winter break from school, as it is usually from late-January to mid-February (4th \u2013 7th weeks). The weekly reported number of scarlet fever cases in 2002 was mostly higher than the weekly average from 2000 to 2006 (Figure 1B). In 2003, except in the 11th week, the number of weekly reported cases in the first 16 weeks was greater than the average. Furthermore, the number of cases between the 4th and 9th weeks was even higher than that in 2002. After the 16th week, the number of cases in 2003 was below the overall average and was significantly decreased from the 17th to 24th week (mid-April to mid-June). A lower level of reported cases lasted until the first half of year 2004. In early 2003, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in Taiwan.

There were 127 isolates with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion, and their pattern (with only one DNA band) was referred to as a SPYS16.0026 PFGE-SmaI type. The 127 isolates with the SPYS16.0026 genotype were further analyzed by digestion with SgrAI. The genetic relatedness of the bacterial strains was evaluated by the levels of similarity among the PFGE-SmaI patterns. A dendrogram was constructed using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmatic mean (UPGMA) algorithm. The dendrogram revealed that all of the emm4 and emm6 isolates, as well as the majority of emm1 and emm22 isolates, were each distributed in a unique cluster. However, the emm12 isolates were located in two distinct clusters and two singletons (Figure 2). One of these clusters included 125 emm12 isolates that were resistant to SmaI digestion. Clustering analysis indicated that isolates with a common emm type were, in general, more closely related than those with different emm types. However, there were a few exceptions. Two strains with different emm types (emm101 and st5282) had indistinguishable PFGE-SmaI patterns, and a strain with a stIL103 type was located within the emm1 cluster (Figure 2). stIL103 is an allele of emm1 that lacks the codons encoding the mature M1 7\u201324 residues (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/strepindex.htm; accessed on April 20th, 2009). Sequence analysis suggests that the st5282 strain could be derived from an emm101 strain via emm gene recombination, as the sequence for the first 26 codons of the st5282 gene were identical to that for the emm101 gene. Two emm12 and one emm22 isolates were distant from the major emm12 and emm22 clusters (Figure 2). The 127 SmaI-resistant isolates were identified to be of emm12, emm1 or emm58 type.",

The stIL103 strain is an exception to this, as it shared high PFGE pattern similarity with the cluster of emm1 strains and was therefore considered to be part of the emm1 clone. Based on the groupings made by the PFGE patterns, six major emm (emm1, emm4, emm6, emm12, emm12* and emm22) clones were identified and are shown in Figure 2. The emm12* clone represents the emm12 strains with DNA resistant to SmaI digestion. The six major emm clones made up 96.5% of the 1,218 isolates. The adjusted number of the annual confirmed cases of scarlet fever in central Taiwan ranged from 142 to 282 between 2000 and 2006 (Table 1), and 115 to 273 isolates were collected each year for genotyping. The number of isolates genotyped was adjusted to the number of annual confirmed cases to investigate the association of the fluctuation of scarlet fever cases and the relative prevalence of the emm clones. As shown in Figure 4, the emm12* and emm12 clones were the most prevalent in 2000. The two clones declined over time and were at their lowest levels in 2003. The emm1 clone was the most prevalent in 2002 and the emm4 clone was predominant in 2003 and 2004. In 2001, although the number of emm12* and emm12 clones declined, the number of emm1 clones increased significantly. The total number of scarlet fever cases in 2002 was doubled that in 2000 and were primarily attributed to an increase in the number of the emm1, emm4 and emm6 clones. The number of cases in 2003 was considerably lower than that in 2002, likely due to a decline in all major clones except for emm4. The number of cases increased significantly again in 2005, and this increase is associated with a dramatic rise in the prevalence of the emm12 clone.",

However, the prevalence and distribution of emm types could have geographic variation. Yan et al. [9] analyzed 77 S. pyogenes isolates collected from scarlet fever patients between 1993 and 2002 in southern Taiwan and found only three emm types among the isolates, with emm1 being the most prevalent type. Chen and colleagues characterized 830 isolates collected between 2001 and 2002 in northern Taiwan and found that the most frequent emm types were emm1 (29.2%), emm4 (24.1%), emm12 (19.0%), emm6 (15.8%), stIL103 (5.7%) and emm22 (1.9%) [10]. In our study, the most common emm types in 427 isolates collected in the same time period in central Taiwan were emm12 (35.6%), emm1 (34.2%), emm4 (18.5%), emm6 (7.5%) and emm11 (0.9%). stIL103 was present in northern Taiwan, but it was not found in the central region during the same time period. Thus, the distribution and frequency of emm types appear to be geographically varied even in such a small country. The geographic variation in the prevalence of emm clones may explain why the epidemiological trend of scarlet fever in 2006 in central Taiwan was different from that in the whole country.",

The emm12 strains belong to two major clones and two singletons, and emm22 strains belong to one major clone and one singleton (Figure 2). Thus, six emm clones caused most (96.5%) of the scarlet fever cases in central Taiwan during the seven year time period. The fluctuation of scarlet fever cases was associated with the shuffling of the prevalent emm clones (Figure 4). The finding that only a few prevalent M (emm) types caused most occurrences of scarlet fever in a specific location in a given year period, as well as the shuffling of predominant M types, has been observed in many epidemiological studies in the early 20th century [11]. During major epidemics of streptococcal infections in previous years, only a few serotypes predominated, and the strains were rich in M protein, encapsulated and were highly virulent [11]. Type-specific immunity was important for preventing re-infection with the same M type. It is thought that the shuffling of predominant M types is due to the type-specific immunity, leading to the decline of infections with certain M types and the emergence of other virulent M types. In the present study, the prevalence of the emm12*, emm1 and emm6 clones both increased and decreased within one year. In contrast, the emm12 and emm4 clones persisted throughout the seven year period. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that the emm12 and emm4 clones produced less M protein and were less virulent than the emm12*, emm1 and emm6 clones.",

Even some major PFGE genotypes, such as SPYS16.0026 of the emm12* clone, SPYS16.0020 of the emm6 clone and SPYS16.0022 of the emm1 clone, remained prevalent for only 2\u20133 years before declining. However, the SPYS16.0013 genotype of the emm12 clone did not follow this trend, as it was prevalent throughout 2000\u20132006 and was most prevalent in 2006. If a newly emerging strain can only prosper in a specific location for a few years, then the emm12:SPYS16.0013 strains isolated during two different time periods should be different. These differences may not be detectable by PFGE analysis. Whether bacterial isolates that prevail for two periods become genetically diversified is an interesting subject and may be studied by other genotyping methods, such as single nucleotide polymorphism, by virulence gene detection and by antimicrobial susceptibility testing.",

Of the 127 SPYS16.0026 isolates, 125 belonged to the emm12 type. The first isolate resistant to SmaI digestion was identified in central Taiwan in 1998 and was an emm33 type. The emm12:SPYS16.0026 strain was detected for the first time in 1999 [7]. Our previous studies indicated that the emm12:SPYS16.0026 strain is most likely derived from an emm12:SPYS16.0013 strain by an insertion of a large DNA fragment into the genome [7]. The large DNA segment could have carried the gene(s) responsible for DNA methylation and resistance to cleavage by SmaI. These strains were analyzed with SgrAI. Clustering analysis of the PFGE-SgrAI patterns revealed diverse genetic relationships among the emm12:SPYS16.0026 strains (Figure 3). The high genetic divergence suggests that the emm12:SPYS16.0026 strains have derived from multiple origins. Recently, Euler et al. [12] have shown that resistance to SmaI cleavage is due to the presence of a DNA methyltransferase gene, which is carried on a mobile chimeric element that has transposon- and bacteriophage-like characteristics. This mobile element may explain the high genetic diversity among the SmaI-resistant strains that emerged in such short period of time.",

However, the dramatic drop in reported cases in 2003 is difficult to explain. In early 2003, Taiwan was badly hit by a severe SARS outbreak. The SARS epidemic in Taiwan had two distinct stages, with the beginning in the late-February (the 9th week) and the second ending in mid-June [13]. The stage I epidemic occurred from late-February to mid-April (the 9th to 16th week) and consisted of only scattered, sporadic cases, with most of the patients having recently traveled to China. In this stage, the disease did not cause much panic and the level of scarlet fever remained high. In stage II (from mid-April to mid-June or the 17th to 24th week), several clusters of infection occurred via intra-hospital or inter-hospital transmission. Enormous panic spread over the whole country after an outbreak of nosocomial infection was confirmed on the 22nd of April. The disease was subsequently transmitted to several hospitals and spread from the North to the South. The number of scarlet fever cases dropped remarkably during this period. Because a large portion of the SARS infections was associated with hospitals, fear of SARS drove people out of hospitals and public places. This fear and the change of people's behavior may have significantly reduced the number of outpatients and the transmission of many infectious diseases, including scarlet fever. In fact, the SARS outbreak had a long-term effect on the occurrences of scarlet fever. After the SARS epidemic, the number of weekly scarlet fever reports was often lower than the overall average until the first half of 2004.",
