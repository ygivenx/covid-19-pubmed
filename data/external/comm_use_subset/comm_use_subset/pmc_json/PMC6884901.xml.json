In young animals, diarrheal disease accounts for an estimated multi-million dollar loss annually to the livestock industry due to mortality, reduced weight gain, treatment costs and trade sanctions on exporting animal products from infected countries [3, 4]. Passive lactogenic immunity that provides protective IgG in colostrum and a continuous supply of secretory IgA (sIgA) in milk plays a significant role in conferring protection against enteric pathogens in neonates [5]. For example higher pathogen-specific IgA antibody (Ab) titers in milk are associated with lower incidence of enteric disease in pigs and children [6\u20139]. Additionally, boosting the maternal immune response may have beneficial consequences for the mother, providing protection against disease during pregnancy and lactation. Enhancing immunity by maternal vaccination has the potential to provide a dual benefit in immune protection for the mother\u2013neonatal dyad.",

In adult pigs, PEDV causes watery diarrhea, depression and anorexia as well as agalactia and reduced reproductive performance [2, 11]. Due to the high virulence of PEDV and the na\u00efve, immature immune system of neonatal piglets, passive lactogenic immunity to PEDV induced via the gut-mammary gland (MG)-sIgA axis during pregnancy and lactation remains the most promising and effective way to protect nursing piglets against PEDV-induced disease [8, 12\u201315]. Providing sufficient PEDV-specific lactogenic immunity is dependent on trafficking of IgA antibody secreting cells (ASCs) from the intestine to the MG and accumulation of sIgA Abs in milk [7, 8, 13, 14, 16]. However, little is known regarding the anti-viral humoral immune response during pregnancy and the level of lactogenic immune protection generated after induction of the gut-MG-sIgA axis is variable. Indeed, our lab demonstrated that third trimester PEDV-infected gilts provided insufficient passive lactogenic immune protection to PEDV-challenged nursing piglets compared with second or first trimester PEDV-infected gilts [16]. Therefore, identifying cost effective strategies to stimulate and enhance trafficking of PEDV IgA ASCs to the MG and accumulation of PEDV sIgA Abs in milk in a pregnant swine model is critical for development of maternal vaccines and therapeutics that improve maternal and lactogenic immunity and neonatal health.",

            "text": "Retinoic acid (RA) is a vitamin A (VA) metabolite with pleiotropic effects on the immune system [17, 18]. For example, VA deficient (VAD) individuals with serum retinol levels at 0.70 \u00b5mol/L or below are more susceptible to some enteric and respiratory diseases, with young children at the highest risk [19, 20]. Specifically, VA is required for the enhancement and regulation of immune responses and cellular trafficking in the gut. Lamina propria (LP) CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) synthesize RA through expression of retinal dehydrogenases (i.e. Aldh1a1/2) [21]. Synergistically with locally produced cytokines, CD103+ LP DCs upregulate mucosal trafficking adhesion molecules, integrin \u03b14\u03b27 and chemokine CC receptor (CCR)9 expression on B and T lymphocytes after interaction in the Peyer\u2019s Patches or mesenteric lymph node (MLN) [22\u201324]. For example, VAD mice had significantly decreased \u03b14\u03b27+ memory T cells in lymphoid organs and T cells in the LP [24]. Additionally, VAD alters cytokine responses during infection by skewing towards an increased T-helper cell type-1 (Th1) cytokine response in infants and mice [25, 26]. Treatment of T cells with 10 nM RA in vitro resulted in a shift toward Th2 cytokine responses [26] promoting an immunoregulatory environment. Therefore, even subclinical deficiencies in VA may negatively impact mucosal lymphocyte trafficking and gut homeostasis during pregnancy.",

Using a gnotobiotic pig model, our lab demonstrated that subclinical VAD piglets had decreased frequencies of CD103+ LP DCs, resulting in decreased adaptive immune responses to human rotavirus (HRV) and prolonged diarrhea [27, 28]. VAD gnotobiotic piglets vaccinated with attenuated HRV demonstrated higher diarrhea severity post HRV challenge compared with vaccinated VA sufficient piglets. This coincided with lower serum IgA HRV Ab titers and significantly decreased intestinal IgA ASCs post-challenge suggesting a compromised anamnestic immune response [28, 29]. However, these parameters and the impact of VA supplementation during pregnancy on the gut-MG-sIgA axis and passive neonatal immunity are largely undefined. Therefore, we hypothesized that oral VA supplementation of PEDV-infected pregnant gilts would enhance trafficking of IgA ASCs from the gut to the MG leading to increased accumulation of sIgA Abs in milk and passive lactogenic protection of PEDV-challenged nursing piglets.",

Dietary VA recommendations given for swine [31] are represented by physiologically-based mathematical models developed for relatively disease-free environments. Therefore, it is likely that the dietary VA required during pregnancy to efficiently stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis and provide sufficient lactogenic immune protection to neonates during an enteric viral infection is higher than current dietary recommendations. To investigate the impact of daily oral VA supplementation during gestation and lactation, we supplemented gilts with non-teratogenic, yet physiologically relevant levels of oral retinyl acetate [30 000 international units (IU)] daily starting at the beginning of the third trimester and lasting throughout lactation. We demonstrated that daily oral VA supplementation in PEDV-infected gilts decreased diarrhea, increased the numbers of PEDV IgA ASCs and PEDV IgA Abs in serum pre-partum and IgA immunoglobulin secreting cells (IgSCs) and IgA+\u03b27+ cells in milk post piglet challenge, providing greater lactogenic immune protection to neonatal nursing piglets.",

All methods were carried out in accordance with approved protocol (2015A00000071) and relevant regulations and pigs were maintained, sampled, and euthanized humanely. First parity PEDV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) seronegative pregnant gilts (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire \u00d7 Duroc cross-bred) arrived at our facilities from either The Ohio State University swine center facility or a commercial swine herd by gestation day (GD) 70 and housed individually in an open pen during gestation and the majority of lactation. Gilts were placed in farrowing crates 3\u20135 days prior to expected farrowing and 3\u20135 days post-partum to ensure safe delivery and interaction with piglets. Artificial light was regulated by a 12:12 light/dark timer. However, natural light also entered the animal rooms from nearby windows. Gilts were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: (1) MEM-infected (mock) (n = 4); (2) MEM-infected + daily oral VA supplemented (mock + VA) (n = 4); (3) third trimester [GD 96\u201397 (~18 days pre-partum)] PEDV-infected (PEDV) (n = 6); and (4) third trimester PEDV-infected + daily oral VA supplemented (PEDV + VA) (n = 5). VA-supplemented gilts orally received 30 000 IU/day of retinyl acetate from GD 76 throughout lactation (Figure 1A). Considering the circadian nature of trafficking lymphocytes [36, 37] retinyl acetate was supplemented two times per day (15 000 IU at 0900 h and 15 000 IU at 1700 h). Gilt fecal samples were collected, and clinical signs observed on post-PEDV infection day (PID) 0\u201315. Fecal consistency was scored as follows: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semi-liquid; 3, liquid, respectively. A fecal consistency score of > 1 was considered as diarrhea [13, 38]. Blood samples were taken on PID 0, 6\u20138 and 13\u201317 for serum and mononuclear cell (MNC) isolation (Figure 1A). All gilts naturally farrowed in our facilities at GD 114 (\u00b1 3) and colostrum was collected within 12 h of parturition. All piglets were allowed to suckle naturally after birth and were kept with their mothers throughout lactation. Piglets were orally PEDV-challenged at 3\u20135 days of age (Figure 1B). Gilt and piglet serum was collected on post piglet challenge day (PCD) 0, 5\u20139, 12\u201317 and 21\u201329. All colostrum and milk samples were collected after administration of 2 cc oxytocin intramuscularly (IM) at post-partum day (PPD) 0, 3\u20135, 8\u201314 and 15\u201322 (Figure 1B). Gilt MG biopsies were collected at GD 104\u2013114 and PPD 8\u201314. Piglet fecal samples were collected, and clinical signs and body weights recorded daily on PCD 0\u20137 and every other day through PCD 15. All animals were euthanized at PCD 21\u201329. Gilt blood, ileum, MG, MLN and spleen tissues were collected for MNC isolation. Piglet blood was collected, and the serum separated for immunologic assays.",

Vitamin A is a critical mediator of mucosal immune function and is essential for lymphocyte trafficking in the gut. For example, VAD leads to increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens and VA supplementation alleviates the negative effects of certain infectious diseases [18, 27, 29, 43]. This is particularly relevant during pregnancy and the neonatal period when there is greater risk for clinical and subclinical VAD [44, 45]. To investigate the impact of VA on maternal and lactogenic immunity, we supplemented third trimester PEDV-infected gilts with oral retinyl acetate beginning at GD 76 and throughout lactation. We demonstrated that VA supplementation of PEDV-infected gilts decreased fecal consistency scores in third trimester gilts. Also, PEDV IgA ASCs and Abs, IgA IgSCs and IgA+\u03b27+ B cells in blood and/or milk were greater in PEDV + VA gilts coinciding with greater mean survival rates in PEDV-challenged nursing piglets. Our findings suggest that daily oral VA supplementation during pregnancy may act as a mucosal adjuvant, enhancing maternal IgA and lactogenic immunity during PEDV infection.",

However, these recommendations were developed assuming disease-free environments. Considering serum VA concentrations in swine decrease with increasing gestation [27] and parity (A.N. Vlasova and L.J. Saif, unpublished observations), it is likely that dietary VA recommendations for gestating gilts and sows are suboptimal during viral or bacterial infections. Due to the limited available studies on vitamin A supplementation in pregnant swine, we relied on literature from other species to inform our dose decision. Females of child-bearing age on a vitamin A-poor diet given a single oral dose of 30 000 IU retinyl palmitate produced a dose-related and sustained increase in plasma retinyl esters and retinoic acids [46]. Additionally, supplementing pregnant women with an oral dose of 10 000 IU/day of vitamin A resulted in enhanced prenatal H1N1-vaccine responses in mothers [47]. Therefore, if viral infection during swine pregnancy results in subclinical vitamin A deficiency, we reasoned that 30 000 IU would be an appropriate dose to elicit a physiological and immunological response. Additionally, based on nonhuman primate data, an oral dose of 30 000 IU retinoic acid is non-teratogenic [48]. Indeed, the presumed upper safe level of dietary VA is up to ten times the nutritional requirements in swine [31]. In in a previous study, harmful effects of VA toxicity were only observed in swine when more than 100 times the nutritional requirement was given over an extended period of time [31, 49]. Therefore, we reasoned that daily oral VA supplementation of 30 000 IU starting in the third trimester and lasting throughout lactation was unlikely to cause harmful effects. Indeed, no signs of hypervitaminosis A [50] were observed in gilts or piglets.",

Additionally, the rate of intestinal VA metabolism after oral supplementation contributes to the systemic exposure to VA metabolites [52]. For example, in feed-restricted lactating sows fed 35 \u00b5mol of 3,4-didehydroretinyl acetate (vitamin A2), serum 3,4-didehydroretinyl ester concentrations peaked 3 h post-prandial and returned to near baseline levels by 24 h [53]. If there were a transient increase in serum VA concentrations, it is unlikely that we would detect it as blood was collected from gilts immediately prior to VA supplementation at 0900 h. Similar to previous findings in swine and humans [27, 30], our study demonstrated decreased mean serum retinol concentrations immediately prior to parturition. This coincides at a time when chemokine CCR9 and CCR10 secretion and \u03b14\u03b27+ expression and their cognate receptors increase in the MG to recruit circulating ASCs into colostrum and milk [54, 55]. These results highlight the importance of understanding the role of VA during pregnancy and its potential effects on maternal immunity and the gut-MG-sIgA during an enteric viral infection.",

This suggests that oral VA supplementation may enhance innate immune protection against PEDV in third trimester gilts. For example, previous studies of rats [56] and mice [57] reported decreased NK cell frequency and function during VAD and supplementation of \u03b2-carotene (a VA precursor) in vivo and in vitro increased NK cell cytotoxic activity [57]. This is in agreement with previous work in our lab demonstrating an association between increased NK cell frequencies in blood and decreased clinical signs in PEDV-challenged piglets [58]. PEDV infection is associated with local and systemic inflammation and increased concentrations of serum innate and proinflammatory cytokines [58, 59]. Indeed, protection against PEDV-induced disease was associated with a delay in serum proinflammatory cytokines post PEDV challenge in piglets [58]. Our findings demonstrate a trend whereby PEDV + VA gilts had numerically reduced mean proinflammatory cytokines and increased immunoregulatory and tissue repair cytokines IL-10 and IL-22, respectively, coinciding with significantly decreased diarrhea scores compared with PEDV gilts. These responses may aide in establishment of gut homeostasis, thereby reducing the severity of PEDV infection in third trimester gilts.",

For example, the significant increase in circulating PEDV IgA Abs and ASCs at PID 6\u20138 and 13\u201317, respectively, coinciding with significantly increased normalized IgA+\u03b27+ cells in PEDV + VA gilts, suggests that oral VA supplementation increased migration of PEDV stimulated B cells from the intestine into the circulation post PEDV infection. Indeed, trafficking IgA ASCs predominate in the lymphoid tissues of the gut [60] and migrate into the circulation after intestinal infection [39]. This is in agreement with previous studies from our lab demonstrating an IgA ASC dominant response after intestinal TGEV [61, 62], PEDV [16] and RV [39] infection in swine. Our lab also previously demonstrated that VA status influences anti-viral B cell immunity. For example, HRV-vaccinated VA sufficient piglets had increased HRV specific IgA ASCs and Abs in the duodenum post HRV challenge compared with vaccinated VAD piglets [29]. Furthermore, mucosal associated adhesion receptors are imprinted on immune cells responding to tissue-specific immune interactions [63]. For example, \u03b14\u03b27 integrin expression on intestinal lymphocytes increases after interaction with VA synthesizing DCs in intestinal Peyer\u2019s patches, promoting cellular migration in the gut mucosa and lymphoid tissue [24]. In our study, mean frequencies of \u03b14+\u03b27+ B cells (normalized to PID 0) increased numerically in PEDV (\u00b1 VA) gilts at PID 6\u20138 and 13\u201317 and mean frequencies of IgA+\u03b27+ B cells were significantly higher at PID 13\u201317 in PEDV + VA compared with mock and PEDV gilts. This suggests that VA supplementation may influence migration of IgA+ cells after PEDV infection.",

These results are in agreement with previous work in our lab demonstrating that increased lactogenic immune protection in PEDV nursing piglets correlated with PEDV IgA ASCs and Abs in milk [16]. Additionally, in TGEV-infected sows, high rates of protection are associated with high titers of IgA Abs in colostrum and milk [8, 12, 64\u201366]. Similar findings were also reported in mice where supplementation of \u03b2-carotene (a proVA metabolite) during pregnancy and lactation increased IgA IgSC in the MG during lactation [67, 68]. The significant differences in milk PEDV IgA ASCs and total IgA IgSCs in PEDV + VA gilts were limited to post piglet PEDV challenge time points, suggesting a role for VA in enhancing anamnestic lactogenic immune responses.

Lastly, gilt MG, spleen, MLN and ileum tissues were analyzed for PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs at PCD 21\u201329. Due to the high PEDV RNA shedding titers in the feces of mock litters, mock gilts had greater exposure to PEDV than PEDV (\u00b1 VA) infected gilts during both primary (pre-partum) or secondary exposure (post piglet challenge). Therefore, the numbers of mean IgA ASCs in the spleen, MLN and ileum and IgG ASCs in the spleen and ileum were higher at PCD 21\u201329 in mock (\u00b1 VA) compared with PEDV (\u00b1 VA) gilts. Interestingly, however, VA supplemented gilts in both mock and PEDV groups had significantly higher mean PEDV IgA ASCs in the ileum compared with their respective nonsupplemented counterparts. Additionally, while not significant, mean frequencies of \u03b14+\u03b27+ B cells in ileum were higher in PEDV + VA compared with PEDV gilts. These data suggest that VA supplementation had an effect on local IgA immunity as demonstrated previously [24, 69] regardless of past PEDV exposure, potentiating the levels of trafficking IgA ASCs in serum and the MG. Considering that trafficking of IgA+ plasmablasts to the MG is dependent on CCR10 [70] and that RA influences CCR9 and \u03b14\u03b27+-dependent B cell homing in the intestine [23, 24], future investigation of these molecules and their cognate receptor expression and function in VAD models of swine pregnancy is warranted.",

Using a pregnant swine model, our data demonstrate that VA supplementation in third trimester PEDV-infected gilts have a dual benefit to mother and neonate. VA supplementation resulted in less severe diarrhea and lower PEDV RNA shedding titers in pregnant gilts suggesting that VA supplementation promotes homeostasis and immune regulation in the gut post PEDV infection. Additionally, VA supplemented gilts had increased anti-PEDV IgA immunity in blood, milk and ileum. This was associated with increased survival rates in PEDV + VA litters post PEDV challenge. Based on our innovative approach and results demonstrating that VA enhanced intestinal immunity during pregnancy and lactogenic immune protection in nursing piglets, future studies are warranted to better understand the mechanisms involved. This model is applicable to endemic and emerging enteric viral diseases in humans and animals, as similar maternal vaccination and VA supplementation strategies may be needed to enhance the gut-MG-sIgA axis and neonatal protection.",

A Mammary gland (MG), spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and ileum mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated and added to PEDV ELISPOT plates to determine the PEDV specific IgA and B IgG ASCs. C Ileum MNCs were isolated and analyzed for frequencies of \u03b14+\u03b27+ B cells by flow cytometry. Asterisks indicate significant differences among treatment groups at the same time point (mean \u00b1 SEM).
