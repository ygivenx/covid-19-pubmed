Since that time, the virus has caused sporadic outbreaks of mild-to-severe respiratory disease. Approximately 80% of human cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia with 211 cases occurring in the first 9 months of 2017 [3]. Beginning in May 2015, a large hospital-associated outbreak of MERS occurred in the Republic of Korea. The outbreak in Korea resulted in a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, and was the largest outbreak of MERS occurring outside of the Arabian Peninsula [4]. This outbreak highlighted the risk of international dissemination of MERS-CoV and the continued risk of nosocomial infection. As of September 6, 2017, the number of confirmed global cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to World Health Organization was 2079 cases in 27 countries with 722 fatalities, resulting in a case fatality rate around 35%[3].",

While nosocomial infections are common, barrier nursing practices can limit spread of the virus as the virus does not seem to pass easily from person-to-person unless close contact occurs [6]. In humans, MERS-CoV infection typically causes a lower respiratory tract disease such as pneumonia, and common symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, myalgia, and shortness of breath [7]. Symptoms such as gastrointestinal complications and renal failure have also been reported in patients, especially those with severe chronic illness such as diabetes [6, 8]. Systemic dissemination has been documented in locations such as the circulatory system and respiratory tract [9].",

The second objective was to determine if these cells were suitable or appropriate for secondary screens for drugs that have been identified as effective in continuous culture cell lines. Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are professional APCs linking innate and adaptive immunity. These and other APCs act as a first defense against viral infection by stimulating immune surveillance, priming, and tolerance [10, 11]. Appropriately functioning APCs are critical for the ability to mitigate infection and limit the development of disease. APCs are abundant in the respiratory tract where they provide immune surveillance and respond to local tissue inflammation in the airways and the distal lung. An important role of APCs is mitigating infection by producing cytokines that stimulate an inflammatory response and recruiting memory and effector cells to the site of infection [12]. Professional APCs are also an important source of type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2). Type I IFNs have a significant bystander effect on uninfected neighboring cells by inducing an antiviral state, activating innate immune cells, and priming adaptive immunity.",

To rapidly identify potential therapeutic options against emerging viral infections, investigators have adopted the approach of screening existing licensed drugs for efficacy against novel viral pathogens. Screening licensed drugs could expedite the implementation of new medical countermeasures by providing an avenue for off-label use of compounds shown to be useful for the treatment of specific viral diseases.",

Results from previous studies found toremifene citrate (TOMF), chlorpromazine (CPZ) and chloroquine (CQ) to be effective in blocking MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in vitro in established cell lines such as Vero E6 and Huh 7 cells [13, 14]. We established a cell differentiation method to generate large amounts of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) of high quality (>95% purity) for evaluating compounds against other viruses such as yellow fever and Ebola viruses [15]. To address pharmaceutical efficacy against MERS-CoV infection in primary cells critical for blocking infection, we tested several candidate MERS-antivirals in human MDMs and immature dendritic cells. The tested compounds included TOMF, an estrogen receptor antagonist, CPZ, a neurotransmitter inhibitor, and CQ, an antimalarial agent.",

In MDMs, MERS-CoV infection resulted in increased concentrations of almost all antiviral or proinflammatory cytokines and most chemokines (except MCP-1), many of these cytokines or chemokines were released as soon as 1 h pi (Fig 3A) and may have been the result of direct cell stimulation rather than active infection. The high induction of IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 over the course of the infection in MDMs was dramatic, indicating a very strong antiviral response was induced upon MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection repressed IL-6 expression from MDM and this repression decreased over the course of several days (Fig 3A) with a similar response profile seen with chemokines MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP-1. Increased MIP-1\u03b1 and IP-10 expression was observed in immature MDDCs (Fig 3B). However, other than a bolus of IFN-\u03b3 released immediately after the infection of MDDC, the release of most of the cytokines or chemokines from immature and mature MDDCs were negligible over the course of the MERS-CoV infection relative to mock-infected cells (Fig 3B and 3C). As expected in a human population, considerable donor-to-donor variation in the cytokine response was observed following infection with MERS-CoV.",

Therefore, the efficacy of the candidate compounds on MERS-CoV-infected APCs was evaluated by a median TCID50 assay. Mature MDDCs did not produce detectable infectious virus after infection and were therefore excluded (Fig 2C) in these drug activity studies. Cell culture supernatants saved from the cell-based assay were titrated by TCID50 to detect MERS-CoV to evaluate the efficacy of the compounds. There was no virus yield reduction in CQ-treated MDMs or immature MDDCs, though the cytotoxicity was relativity low (Fig 5A and 5B). In CPZ treated cells, around a 2 log10 virus reduction was observed in both cell types. However, high cytotoxicity narrows the therapeutic window in both MDMs and MDDCs (Fig 5A and 5B). A 1\u20131.5 log10 virus reduction was measured in TOMF-treated cells, but only when the dose is higher than 20 \u03bcM, with a corresponding increase in cytotoxicity (Fig 5A and 5B). These observations were similar when compared to the cell-based assay mentioned above. Virus yield reduction data for TOMF, CQ and CPZ in Vero E6 cells showed that CPZ was active against MERS-CoV infection with a 3.1 log10 drop at the drug dosage of 15 \u03bcM, but TOMF and CQ were not active (Fig 5C). These data suggest a strong correlation between VeroE6 cells and MDMs when virus titers are determined by TCID50.",

Productive infection of immature DCs may delay the activation of T cells, therefore allowing more time for MERS-CoV replication or dissemination. An additional reason that immature MDDCs may be more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection than mature MDDCs to MERS-CoV could be their ability to internalize and process viral antigens. After uptake of antigens or pathogens, immature MDDCs may undergo maturation, migrate to lymphatic tissues, and trigger adaptive immune responses. In theory, the ability of sampling and presenting antigen should be enhanced through MDDCs maturation. For example, immature MDDCs may promote viral dissemination of SARS-CoV within the host by recruiting the virus to enter and damage the lymphatic tissues [26].",

            "text": "Following MERS-CoV infection, the induced immune response in APCs was consistent with their susceptibility to infection and the kinetics of virus propagation. The production of proinflammatory cytokines is essential for host resistance against MERS-CoV infection. Infection of MDMs with MERS-CoV appreciably induced the secretion of antiviral cytokines (IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-12p40), moderately or appreciably up-regulated proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), and variably upregulated inflammatory chemokines (MIP-1\u03b1, IP-10, RANTES, IL-8). Clinical studies have shown that expression of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, or IP-10, is highly correlated with disease severity and mortality of SARS patients [30]. Nicholls et al reported that macrophages in lung tissues of SARS patients were identified as the location where the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and virus pathogenesis originated [31]. MDMs secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to activate antiviral mechanisms, which may cause the dysregulated production of these inflammatory mediators leading to damage to neighboring tissues [32]. Expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are a potential indicators of severe respiratory viral infection, such as SARS and human infection by avian influenza viruses [33]. Our data indicate the possibility of an IFN- \u03b3 Th1-mediated inflammatory response that may cause severe MERS disease before an adaptive host immune response is mounted. However, restriction of virus growth in mature MDDCs results in no antiviral activation by IFN-\u03b12. Nevertheless, only moderate expression of IP-10 and minimal induction of MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and RANTES were observed in immature MDDCs. Significant upregulation of most cytokines and chemokines was not observed in either mature or immature MDDCs. Overall, the limited antiviral cytokine response in MDDCs suggests a possible mechanism of immune escape during MERS-CoV infection as seen in SARS-CoV infection [26]. A review of the literature suggests that there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the role on intracellular regulatory mechanisms such as pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) in the control of coronavirus infection. In this study there was essentially no change in the concentration of cytokines/chemokines measured in mature (and non-permissive) MDDCs. In immature MDDCs, while the measured concentration was less than the control cells in many cases, the concentrations of a number of cytokines/chemokines (IL-6, IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1) increased over the course of the infection, specifically on days 6 and 8 when titers were highest. These data suggest that PRR may have been activated, as would be anticipated in a productive viral infection, but the scale and scope was not evaluated. In addition, data obtained for cytokine release very early after infection cannot be properly evaluated due to the potential presence of cellular components in the virus preparations.",

Compounds that target host effectors could be beneficial during the course of infection [37]. MERS-CoV drug screens have been performed mostly in established cell lines such as Vero and Huh 7 cells. Very little drug evaluation has been performed in primary cell lines. Here we picked three FDA-approved broad-spectrum inhibitors (CPZ, CQ, TOMF) that were shown to be effective against MERS-CoV infection in immortalized cell lines [13, 14] and evaluated their antiviral activities in MDMs and MDDCs. We excluded mature MDDCs for drug screening due to the lack of productive MERS-CoV infection. Surprisingly, our findings for TOMF activity in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs and immature MDDCs differed from results of previous studies in Vero E6 cells. TOMF showed minimal activity against MERS-CoV infection in MDMs. TOMF also had little antiviral activity in immature MDDCs until reaching a high concentration (>20 \u03bcM) that was associated with high cytotoxicity. TOMF is an estrogen receptor modulator that has been shown to inhibit filoviruses [38] and block both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with EC50s12.9 and 11.97\u03bcM, respectively, in Vero E6 cells [13]. This drug inhibits late phrase of virus entry by interfering the fusion of filoviruses [38]. However, in primary cells, the EC50 increased to 38 \u03bcM though lower cytotoxicity was seen (CC5 0 = 22.54 \u03bcM). Thus, the therapeutic window for effective treatment with TOMF in primary APCs is narrow.",

The drug interacts with a variety of host proteins and cellular processes, resulting in modulation of immune responses [39]. CQ has also been reported to inhibit replication of multiple viruses such as flaviviruses [40], influenza viruses [41, 42], HIV [40], Ebola [43] and Nipah viruses [44] in vitro.

On the other hand, the mechanism of immune escape through MDDC results in inefficient viral clearance, which may explain the high pathogenicity and clinical manifestations seen in MERS. This study also provides the first demonstration of medical countermeasure evaluation for MERS-CoV in primary APCs and illustrates the importance of using non-immortalized primary cells for the evaluation of drug efficacy. These data also suggest that, given the established mechanisms of action of TOMF, CQ and CPZ, the mechanisms of virus internalization and exocytosis may be different from those used in established cell lines. Before performing in vivo studies, potential compounds should be evaluated in primary cells as major differences may occur between immortalized cell lines and primary cells.",
