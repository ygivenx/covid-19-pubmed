However, previous studies on alphavirus CP indicate that the activity of CP is restored on removal of the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue3839. So, in order to evaluate the enzymatic activity of CVCP, both inactive and active proteins were expressed and purified. Firstly, the protease domain of CVCP was cloned into pET28c vector to form the expression plasmid pET28c-CVCP. The inactive protein contains the full protease domain (106-261 residues). Truncation of the last two residues including C-terminal Trp261 from the inactive construct results in generation of the active form of CVCP (106-259 residues). The optimization of expression conditions was done for both the proteins to get good amount of soluble protein. After optimization of induction temperature, induction time and IPTG concentration, both the proteins having the 6X-His tag at the N-terminus were expressed in the soluble form.",

The in vitro trans-protease activity of CVCP was monitored using the peptide substrate containing 4-(4-dimethylaminophenyl-azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) and 5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) at the N- and C-terminus of the peptide respectively. This pair demonstrates FRET in which EDANS acts as fluorophore and DABCYL as quencher that quenches the fluorescence produced by EDANS. In the presence of protease, the peptide gets cleaved, which separates the two fragments and reduces the FRET signal. The active CVCP exhibits the efficient cleavage of the substrate peptide, which separates EDANS (fluorophore) and DABCYL (quencher) resulting in the increased fluorescence signal. The fluorescence was quenched before the proteolytic cleavage due to the presence of DABCYL within a particular distance range from the fluorophore EDANS (Fig. 3A). The proteolytic reaction was carried out in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) in cuvette (1 ml reaction volume) as well as in 96-well plate (100 \u03bcl reaction volume). The substrate was added to start the reaction and the fluorescence enhancement was recorded with time (Fig. 3B). The relative fluorescence units were calculated for all the readings. Figure 3B shows the typical fluorescence profile for the hydrolysis of the substrate. A control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in the fluorescence intensity (data not shown).",

The Z\u2019 factor with value greater than 0.5 has been considered as an indicator of an authentic and veritable screening assay. The CV of less than 10% represents the less variation within the groups of positive and negative controls. The Z\u2019 factor for the CVCP was calculated as 0.64 using the FRET peptide substrate, which confirms the high sensitivity and efficiency of the assay. The scatter plot distribution of the group reads for both the positive and negative controls is shown in Fig. 4. The value of Z\u2019 factor suggests high quality of the assay with high signal to noise ratio. The degree of variability is 8.68% in the positive control group. The Z\u2019 factor and the CV reveal the reliability of the present FRET based assay in HTS of inhibitors against CVCP.",

Considering this, we screened few compounds and peptides (tryptophan, tryptamine, EW and EWS), and some serine protease inhibitors [(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), benzamidine, N-p-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and 3-acetylindole] for the inhibition of CVCP activity. After the calculation of the cleaved product formed, the comparison was made between the reactions with and without the compound. The CVCP was found resistant to the tryptophan-based compounds, peptides and serine protease inhibitors. It is completely resistant to tryptophan, tryptamine, EWS peptide and PMSF even at their high concentrations (100 \u03bcM). However, peptide EW could show 30% reduction in the activity of CVCP at the concentration of 50 \u03bcM. Other protease inhibitors benzamidine, TPCK and 3-acetylindole also showed less than 40% decrease in enzyme activity at 80 \u03bcM concentrations. Thus, the compounds or peptides tested did not show significant inhibitory activity against CVCP. The proteolytic inhibitory assay was tested using TPCK and chymotrypsin. The positive control with TPCK showed expected inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin with the inhibition constant, Ki = 16.5 \u03bcM.",

The effect of different buffers with different pH values has been observed on the CVCP activity. The Vi was calculated at all different pHs and plotted against the buffer pH. The graph shows a regular pattern of enzymatic reaction, which is optimum at pH 7.0 (Fig. 5A). Thus, the optimal pH for trans-proteolytic activity of CVCP is near the physiological pH 7.0 that mimics the intracellular environment inside the mammalian cell where it undergoes cis-proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, the titration experiment for NaCl demonstrates the effect of increasing salt concentration on CVCP activity. The influence of NaCl concentration on the activity was studied using different NaCl concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, 300 and 500 mM) in the assay buffer. The increase in the enzymatic activity was observed from 0 to 0.1 M NaCl concentration while afterwards from 0.1 to 0.5 M a gradual decrease in the activity was observed. The enzyme shows the maximum activity at 100 mM NaCl concentration (Fig. 5B). The results indicate the ionic strength dependent variations in CVCP activity.",

A very less number of studies have been performed till date that aimed for antivirals development against CHIKV. The non-infectious CHIKV replicon having reporter gene and the cell based phenotypic assay for nsP2 inhibitors of CHIKV have also opened up the possibilities for antiviral screening4546. However, the follow up studies are missing. Also, the lack of an in vitro assay for antiviral screening studies promotes us towards more detailed understanding and development of newer methods for anti-CHIKV compounds screening. A few antiviral drugs have been developed in the last decade47, however, viruses are evolving rapidly and more are emerging in different areas. There is a lack of effective therapies against very important viruses. The re-emergence of CHIKV as an epidemic in a number of different regions456, the addition in the mosquito vector due to the evolution of virus (mutation in E1 glycoprotein)12 and the pathogenicity of virus including persistent arthralgia1 makes it a significant pathogen which needs proper attention. Hence, there is the necessity of anti-CHIKV drug development and efficient therapeutic protocol manifestation. Though the mortality rate for Chikungunya infection is not so high, the high evolution rate in the genome of CHIKV encourages us for the development of new promising antivirals and therapeutics against CHIKV.",

For the general assessment of the assay quality and reliability, the Z\u2019 factor and the coefficient of variation were determined in a 96 well plate and found to be 0.64 and 8.68% respectively. As demonstrated by the values of Z\u2019 factor and CV in this study, the FRET based in vitro proteolytic assay of CVCP is highly convenient and suitable for the HTS of the compounds. The assay might provide a perfect approach to explore first generation CVCP inhibitors. Using a fluorescence plate reader, this assay can be easily performed in a 96- and 384- well plate format for high throughput inhibitor screening against the CVCP. This high throughput protease assay is simple, convenient and cost effective. Few compounds were screened for the inhibition of the CVCP activity. The tryptophan, tryptamine compounds and peptides EW, EWS could not inhibit CVCP activity. Additionally, different serine protease inhibitors PMSF, benzamidine, TPCK and 3-acetylindole also did not seem to act as potent inhibitors of CVCP. This is consistent with the previous reports for the cis-autoproteolytic activity of CVCP and the trans-esterase activity of SFCP where complete resistance to the standard serine protease inhibitors was observed. The cis-autoproteolytic activity of the CVCP was not inhibited by serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride)53. Additionally, the trans esterase activity of the SFCP did not show inhibition in the presence of the protease inhibitor PMSF, chloromethylketones (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-leucine-tyrosine-chloromethylketon and N-benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanine-chloromethylketone) and N-acetyl-glutamate-glutamate-tryptophan p-nitro-anilide38. Hence, it is possible that substrate specificity pockets of CVCP have a distinct conformation as seen in the crystal structure of active AVCP (PDB ID: 4UON) in which Pro215 obtrude to block Trp267 position39.",

In this respect, pH range, different NaCl and glycerol concentrations were used for the measurement of the activity and the relative activity was calculated. The optimum enzyme activity was found at pH 7.0 and 100 mM NaCl concentration. The optimum pH is neutral pH which corresponds to the pH of the mosquito saliva and the human cells. Thus, the optimal activity occurs at the physiological pH 7.0 to match with the host cell pH. The effect of pH on the enzyme activity might be due to the conformational variations in the enzyme structure at different pHs. Additionally, the response of the enzymatic activity with increasing ionic strength indicates the dependence of the protease structure on the salt concentration. The significant increase in enzymatic activity up to 100 mM NaCl concentration might be due to the stabilization of the enzyme with increasing ionic strength, however, the decrease in activity above 100 mM NaCl might be the result of alteration in molecular interaction at the active site or the specificity pocket at high NaCl concentration. The increase in ionic strength might disrupt ionic and polar interactions in the structure of CVCP leading to conformational changes in the active site.",

            "text": "The anti-chaotropic agent glycerol also affects enzyme function. Glycerol can be added up to 20% to the reaction buffer in the CVCP protease assay reaction. In general, glycerol acts as the stabilizing agent for the protein and is not expected to reduce the enzymatic activity. Interestingly, at 50% concentration of the glycerol in the reaction buffer, there is complete loss of the CVCP enzymatic activity. It might be due to the binding of glycerol molecule in the S1 specificity pocket of CVCP that could block entry of the substrate inside the pocket and thus, inhibit catalytic reaction. To explore this possibility, the three dimensional structure of active CVCP was predicted by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of active AVCP (PDB ID: 4UON). CVCP molecular model consists of a chymotrypsin-like serine protease fold with two subdomains and the active site is located at the interface of the subdomains (Fig. 6B). In CVCP, the active site is contributed by His139, Asp161 and Ser213 residues. The S1 specificity pocket is present near the active site to which the conserved P1 substrate residue Trp261 is expected to bind. Furthermore, the superimposition of the homology model of active CVCP in complex with glycerol onto the native AVCP (inactive AVCP, PDB ID: 4AGK) (RMSD = 0.127 \u00c5) shows interaction of glycerol molecule exactly at the same position where conserved P1 tryptophan residue binds in the S1 specificity pocket (Fig. 6C). The S1 specificity pocket of CVCP includes residues Trp189, Ile203 to Ser213, Ile227 to Asn233, and Thr238 to Leu240. These residues create a hydrophobic environment for the binding of substrate. The glycerol molecule fits perfectly inside this hydrophobic pocket in active CVCP structure. The hydroxyl groups of glycerol molecule show interactions with the backbone of Lys209 and also with the active site residue Ser213. In the crystal structure of active AVCP (PDB ID: 4UON), glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant during data collection and was assumed to stabilize the protein by binding to the S1 pocket39. Hence, it can be concluded from the activity assay results coupled with the structural comparison and analysis that at high concentrations glycerol might be competing with the substrate peptide for binding to the S1 specificity pocket of CVCP.",

The stock solutions of 10 mM were made in 100% DMSO, and the required final concentrations of inhibitors were made by dilution in assay buffer. The concentrations of DMSO in the final reactions did not exceed 1.0% (v/v). The substrate was used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcM to minimize the inner filter effect and to produce strong signal. The active CVCP was pre-incubated with the compounds for 30 min followed by addition of substrate peptide. The concentration of compounds used was 50\u2013100 \u03bcM in the final assay volume of 100 \u03bcl. Enzyme reactions were performed in 96-well half area black flat bottom plates (Corning Life Sciences) at 25 \u00b0C and the fluorescence readings were taken at different time points (from 15 to 120 min). The amount of the cleaved product was calculated as described above and compared with the control reaction well without any inhibitor. The formation of the cleaved product should get reduced in the presence of potential inhibitor of the CVCP.
