The avian-like H1N1 was introduced into the swine population after the transmission of H1N1 virus from wild ducks to pigs in the late 1970s\n[3] and since 1979 it has replaced the antigenically and genetically distinguishable North American classical swine H1N1 viruses\n[2]. The H3N2 subtype of human origin formed a stable lineage in European pigs in the early 1970s, but reassortant H3N2 has been dominant since the mid-1980s\n[4]. The H1N2 subtype was first isolated in Great Britain in 1994\n[5].",

Due to the emphasized importance of M. hyopneumoniae in the health classification system and knowledge about the restrictive policy concerning imports of live pigs, sampling and testing at that time were mainly conducted to rule out M. hyopneumoniae infection. Retrospectively, a higher number of H1N1 seropositive samples were found in pigs in herds with clinical signs than in samples of pigs collected for disease monitoring and in samples of pigs in special health class farms. Avian-like swine H1N1 does not necessarily cause coughing in pigs that are free from M. hyopneumoniae infection\n[37], and subclinical infections are possible\n[38,39]. This could have contributed to the delayed detection of influenza virus in Finland. Virus is expected to be found in the respiratory tract of pigs only during the first week after infection, and paired serum samples are recommended for serology that include a second sampling 3 to 4 weeks after acute disease\n[1]. Mild and short-lasting clinical signs are also reported in pigs infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus\n[40]. Mild and short-lasting clinical signs may not motivate extensive sampling.",

The mild signs of avian-like swine H1N1 influenza can allow a wide spread of the introduced virus in na\u00efve pig populations before detection especially, when pigs are free from significant respiratory pathogens like Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. The A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in the time period when pandemic H1N1 was spreading in the human population in Finland.",
