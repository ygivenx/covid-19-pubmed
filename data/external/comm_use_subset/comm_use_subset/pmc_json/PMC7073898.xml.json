However, the bulk of the associated morbidity and mortality is still concentrated within the province of Hubei, China. As of 13 February 2020, there have been 59,907 cumulative cases, including 1368 deaths, reported globally with 48,206 cases reported in Hubei alone [1]. To control the epidemic, the Chinese government has enacted a range of social distancing strategies, such as city-wide lockdowns, screening measures at train stations and airports, active case finding, and isolation of suspected cases. The numbers of cases and deaths continue to accumulate every day. However, the transmission appears to be slowing down outside Hubei due to strict lockdowns combined with isolation and quarantine measures [1,2,3].",

For instance, the case definition has been revised over time, and, as of 12 February 2020, reported cases of the disease incorporate clinically suspected cases in addition to laboratory-confirmed cases, which led to a noticeable increase in cases in the province of Hubei on 13 February 2020. These additional cases are likely historical cases that occurred days or weeks earlier. In the absence of additional information, this change in reporting obscures the true underlying epidemic trajectory, especially in Hubei, and complicates the inference of epidemiological parameters, such as the effective reproduction number, and the calibration of mechanistic transmission models that rely on data after 12 February 2020.",

These approaches are especially useful when the epidemiological data are limited [6,7,8,9]. Real-time short-term forecasts generated from such models can be useful to guide the allocation of resources that are critical to bring the epidemic under control. In this paper, we use dynamic models to generate 5-day and 10-day ahead forecasts of the cumulative reported cases in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, China.",

We then forecasted the trajectory of the epidemic in the provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang, which have exhibited a high burden of COVID-19. We did not fit the data or forecast the epidemic in Hubei, as the recent change in the reporting criteria resulted in a significant jump in reported cases on 13 February 2020. The impact of the new reporting criteria in this province will require a detailed analysis before the data can be fit by our current models.",

Both the GLM and Richards models predict that the provinces are nearing the end of the epidemic (Figure 3 and Figure 4). However, forecasts from the sub-epidemic model, which accommodates more complex trajectories, suggest a longer epidemic wave (Figure 5). Specifically, the sub-epidemic model forecasts for Zhejiang suggest additional smaller sub-epidemics have yet to occur, resulting in higher estimates of cumulative case counts.",

The fluctuating case definition may partially explain the slowing down observed in the data that result in the GLM and Richards model predicting extinction. The kink in the Zhejiang data may suggest a case definition change around 6 February 2020, which would partially explain a decrease in the new daily cases reported. The slowing in cases after 6 February is apparent in both Guangdong and Zhejiang. This pattern must be interpreted with caution; it is not entirely clear whether this is a true decline in transmission, or if it is an artificial decline due to the changing case definition. Therefore, the sub-epidemic model forecasts likely better capture both possibilities. Additionally, on 14 February 2020, China officially reported that 1716 healthcare workers have been infected with the disease, suggesting disease amplification in healthcare settings as has been previously documented for past SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks [15]. This analysis does not account for the greater potential for transmission in healthcare settings. Finally, we note that our forecasts are not sensitive to the last data point used to calibrate the models (13 February 2020), despite the most recent change in case reporting (Tables S2 and S3).",
