For the past decade, this traditional, health facility-based, and government-implemented surveillance system has undergone improvements, yet it still suffers from untimely reporting, aggregation, and publication of data. Due to these surveillance problems, the identification and efficiency of intervention that may prevent dengue epidemics could be limited. Many suggestions involving alternative approaches outside the virological and clinical domains (e.g., telephone triage calls, sales of over-the-counter drugs, and school/work absenteeism) have been proposed in parallel with traditional surveillance [12,13,14]. Among these non-traditional suggestions, online activity or Internet search tracking has shown the potential to complement current epidemiological methods because of its efficiency and the availability of real-time population trends [15,16,17,18,19].",

Google Trends is an accessible Internet platform that provides geospatial and temporal patterns of search volumes for user-specified terms towards public health surveillance. The association and predictive power of Google Trends towards disease surveillance [21] have been studied extensively especially for diseases such as influenza [22], HIV [23], scarlet fever [24], malaria [25], Ebola [26], and Zika [27]. Countries like Bolivia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Mexico, and Venezuela have recently investigated the application of Google Trends for dengue surveillance and it has been observed to be highly correlated with the temporal pattern of dengue in a country-wide scale [16,17,28,29]. Therefore, this platform may complement in assisting real-time dengue case surveillance [16] and can be potentially extended towards predicting early dengue disease outbreaks [17]. ",

This study has two specific objectives. The first objective assesses the temporal relationship between Google Dengue Trends (GDT) and dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila. While such an endeavor may be deemed common due to the numerous studies with the same objective, we considered our approach in fulfilling this objective to be both methodological as well as investigative. Here we underscore the importance of data processing towards a \u2018weekly\u2019 temporal pattern, such as adjusting GDT (AdjGDT) or scaling dengue incidence (ScDI). Furthermore, we compare the temporal pattern and its association from varying processed or transformed data of GDT and dengue incidence. On the other hand, the second objective of the study explores the health-seeking behavior of users based on their dengue-related search queries. Currently, such studies do not incorporate such findings as there have been few studies that evaluated related-search queries of dengue. Therefore, investigating this matter may provide a better understanding of the population\u2019s health-seeking behaviors regarding the disease [32].",

The region contains 16 cities and 1 municipality with a total population of 12.8 million [33] (Figure 1). The map layer of the administrative city boundaries of Metropolitan Manila was obtained from the Philippine Geographic Information System (GIS) Data Clearinghouse [34]. The population statistics of each city and municipality were obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority agency [33]. The most recent Philippine population census was reported during the years 2010 and 2015. Thus, we utilized the compounded population growth rate to calculate the population of the entire region and from each city/municipality for the years 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 with the assumption of a fixed growth rate.",

The use of Pearson\u2019s correlation follows the choice of previous studies [16,27,28] that correlated GDT and dengue and, in addition, no controls for correlated errors were used. The first GDT data type refers to the generated weekly value for a yearly period. It should be emphasized that GDT values are relative and can change depending on the specified time range used during the search query. For instance, the GDT value for a specific week using a one-year query would not be necessarily the same when a two-year query is used. This is because a displayed GDT value is highly dependent on the highest query volume for a given time period. Moreover, GDT has a limit or restriction in displaying weekly values. It can only generate weekly values up to a maximum time period of 4 years and further than that will result in generating monthly values. If one does not realize how these values are calculated and displayed by Google Trends, researchers opt to \u2018stitch\u2019 together yearly GDT values, which is inappropriate. ",

Afterwards, we multiplied each weekly-level value by the monthly-level query result and divided it by the monthly-level average from the weekly data. This adjustment procedure accounts for differences in the relative prevalence of searches over time in the stacked weekly-level data. Thus, the second GDT data type is the weekly adjusted value (AdjGDT). On the other hand, the first dengue data type is the calculated weekly dengue incidence rate (DI) while its log transformed (LogDI) is the second dengue data type. Log transformation was performed in order to reduce the skewing of the data and destabilize the variance. ",

It also showed that the adjusted GDT captured the similar temporal trend of DI (Figure 2c), resulting in a better estimate of the association. Furthermore, if dengue incidence was scaled accordingly (Figure 2e), it showed that it can nearly capture the unadjusted GDT trend which also resulted to an improved correlation coefficient.

Moreover, scaling of DI was simple in order to demonstrate the relative nature of the GDT value, and by standardizing it in the same unit of magnitude would generate a better and improved association. Previous dengue studies that assessed the association with GDT used a monthly time scale, therefore, an adjustment procedure is unnecessary. In most dengue-endemic countries such as the Philippines, health agencies implement and follow a weekly reporting of the said disease [47]. Although it is possible and easier to aggregate the weekly number of cases to generate a monthly value, investigating and utilizing a weekly temporal scale are more informative and useful in future applications.

There is only one study that investigated the association of GDT and dengue in a regional scale where the correlation among different regions varies substantially with a high correlation coefficient resulting from regions with higher dengue incidence [27]. We infer that other factors such as the climate play a role in the temporal pattern of dengue incidence in Metropolitan Manila as suggested by a recent study [49].

However, this approach has its limitations and drawbacks as exemplified when Google Trends was assessed during the influenza pandemic of 2009, the 2012/2013 flu epidemic season in the US and, the Ebola pandemic in Africa [47,50]. These studies outlined that the Google Trends platform is limited to the proportion of the population who use the Internet to obtain health-related information [47], intense media coverage [50,51,52] and algorithm dynamics [51,52,53]. Moreover, the application of GDT may only be suited to areas with high dengue incidence [29]. Since the study was only limited in investigating one region in the Philippines, our interpretation cannot be the same in other regions with a large proportion of users situated in rural areas where Internet access is limited.

Although previous studies [17,21] and the results of our analysis showed the temporal relatedness of GDT and dengue incidence, relying only on search query data for making future public health decisions on dengue may trigger unnecessary panic from the public [48]. On the contrary, results from GDT can help to identify hotspots where further dengue investigations can be conducted. This is in line with the concept of \u2018now-casting\u2019 where potential locations for dengue cases can be predicted at present (through real-time monitoring of GDT data) rather than in the future to prevent outbreaks [16]. While countries with underdeveloped disease surveillance systems can greatly benefit from real-time monitoring of GDT data to supplement traditional epidemiologic investigations when identifying hotspots [17], caution should still be made considering that not all actual hotspots can be identified due to variations in Internet access [16]. Overall, GDT\u2019s capability as an early warning signal for outbreaks can only be attained if it can be combined with meteorological, environmental, social, and entomological factors to produce a robust dengue prediction model [48,54]. Therefore, more work is needed to establish the reliability and real-world applicability of GDT results for dengue surveillance and control [21].",

These cities also consistently showed high GDT values across all time periods. These three cities share common characteristics that resulted to such an outcome. One of the characteristics could be the cities\u2019 high population density that contributes to the presence of a high proportion of Internet users. Previous works in the US suggest that high population density correlates with more Internet users [52,55]. Another characteristic would be the presence of major business districts, hospitals, educational institutions and recreational activities (e.g., shopping malls) in these cities which indicates rapid urbanization. A study from 28 Asian countries, including the Philippines, showed that urbanization is related to higher Internet penetration [56]. As of January 2018, the Internet penetration rate in the Philippines is 63% which translates to 67 million users [57], the majority of whom are residents of urban areas such as Metropolitan Manila. In general, people living in urban areas with high population density tend to have more Internet access and this facilitates greater health seeking on the Internet. In line with this, the aforementioned characteristics of these cities with GDT values could partially explain why the study did not find a significant spatial relationship with DI at the city level. It should be emphasized that each identified dengue case would use the patient\u2019s residential location to report in the national health agency. Therefore, we hypothesize that search activity in dengue may likely occur in a person\u2019s work or school location (e.g., Makati, Quezon, or Manila) rather than in their residence (e.g., San Juan). Search queries performed by users would not particularly coincide with their place of residence since this highly urbanized region would promote frequent mobilization or traveling from one city to the other. Moreover, Internet access in these highly-developed cities may be considerably better than their residence due to the occurrence business districts and recreational activities (e.g., shopping malls).",
