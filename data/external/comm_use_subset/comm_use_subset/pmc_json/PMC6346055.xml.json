            "text": "Needle-free vaccines delivered via mucosal surface have the potential of being better-accepted by the most vulnerable and commonly vaccinated population of children. They also present higher likelihood to generate the necessary B and T cell responses for optimal protection at the portal of entry of infectious agents, in addition to promoting the levels of systemic immunity generally achieved by conventional injected vaccines1. Secretory IgA (SIgA) represents the hallmark of immune responses at mucosal surfaces. The high resistance of these polymeric immunoglobulins to degradation in the harsh environment of mucosal surfaces, including the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, allow them to provide frontline protection at the portal of entry of most infectious microbes2. While mucosally delivered subunit-vaccines have the potential of stimulating broad mucosal and systemic immune responses, their ability to trigger mucosal IgA relies on the addition of effective vaccine adjuvants. Stimulation of inductive site immune responses in different mucosal sites (i.e., gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, rectal) imprints the expression of discrete mucosal homing receptors and adressins which allow effector B and T cells to home in distinct mucosal tissues. For example, intranasal delivery of vaccines containing appropriate mucosal adjuvants can promote specific immune responses in the airways. However, safety issues were reported following intranasal application of  a ganglioside-binding toxin as adjuvant. Sublingual immunization is now being considered as an alternative to the intranasal route of vaccination. Nonetheless, a major challenge for the development of sublingual vaccines is the identification of appropriate antigen-adjuvant formulations2,3.",

            "text": "We have previously shown that Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (EdTx) is an effective adjuvant capable of promoting both systemic immunity and mucosal SIgA responses against nasally co-administered vaccine antigens4,5. However, when EdTx was tested as adjuvant for sublingual vaccination, it promoted antigen-specific IgG responses in the bloodstream but failed to elicit IgA responses in the serum or mucosal secretions6. This lack of IgA responses was not due to the route of immunization itself, since sublingual immunization could induce these responses when vaccines were administered with a range of adjuvants including bacterial enterotoxins, toll-like receptor ligands, and STING ligands7\u201311. Interestingly, the lack of IgA response correlated with the recruitment of neutrophils after sublingual administration of EdTx, and partial depletion of neutrophils before sublingual immunization restored the adjuvant activity of EdTx for IgA responses6. Neutrophils represent the largest population of myeloid cells in the bloodstream and characterize the initial response to inflammatory events through their own degranulation and cytokine production12. Unfortunately, depletion of neutrophils prior to immunization is not a feasible approach and thus, new strategies are needed to improve the efficacy of EdTx-based, and possibly other, sublingual vaccines.",

            "text": "We first asked whether supplementation with a NEI could affects IgG responses induced by a model sublingual vaccine containing EdTx as adjuvant. Vaccines targeting two or more pathogens can reduce the schedule of vaccination. We choose to use Ovalbumin (OVA) plus Bacillus anthracis protective antigen (PA) as a combinatorial antigen to test the ability of NEI to regulate the immune response to two different antigens. OVA is a well-studied model antigen which allow a more in-depth analysis of immune responses to vaccination thanks to the large number of reagents available to study OVA-specific B and T cell responses. On the other hand, the use of PA as antigen allowed us to address the biological significance of the antibody responses through the assessment of anti-PA antibodies (Abs) ability to neutralize anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx). Analysis of OVA-specific IgG1 responses revealed that NEI increased the magnitude of responses induced by EdTx, and this effect was evident as early as day 14 after the first immunization (Fig. 1A). We also found that the NEI used in these studies had an intrinsic adjuvant activity and increased IgG1 responses when co-administered with antigen in the absence of EdTx (Fig. 1A). Analysis of other IgG subclasses showed no evidence that the NEI enhanced IgG2a/c, or IgG3 when co-administered with antigen in the absence of EdTx (Fig. 1B,C). However, the NEI significantly increased serum IgG2b responses induced by EdTx as adjuvant (Fig. 1B,C).",

Sublingual application of antigen alone or antigen plus NEI did not stimulate antigen-specific IgA responses in the gut. Addition of NEI to a vaccine formulation containing antigen and EdTx resulted in the induction of fecal IgA responses, which were detectable 3 weeks after the first immunization (day 21) and were further increased one week later (day 28) (Fig. 4A). To determine if NEI supplementation promoted generalized IgA responses in other mucosal secretion, we analyzed these responses in vaginal washes. Unlike mucosal secretions of the gastrointestinal  tract, the vaginal washes of mice immunized with EdTx and NEI showed only non-significant levels of antigen-specific IgA responses (Fig. 4B). However, NEI supplementation was able to enhance the vaginal IgG responses induced by EdTx as adjuvant (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that NEI might promote expression of gut homing receptors by IgA producing cells, while the elevated IgG antibodies found in the secretions of the genitourinary tract might be coming from diffusion of IgG from the blood. It is important to indicate that anti-PA Ab responses measured in mucosal secretions of mice which  received the NEI were of the same profile and magnitude than anti-OVA Ab responses (not shown).",

Furthermore, NEI and EdTx promoted the same frequencies of antigen-specific IL-21+CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5D).

Sublingual vaccination is theoretically very simple as it involves application of liquid or rapidly dissolving tablets to the floor of the oral cavity. Like vaccines delivered at other mucosal sites, sublingual vaccines have the potential of producing mucosal SIgA in addition to IgG responses in the general bloodstream. Because sublingually administered vaccines are less likely to reach central nervous system tissues, they are potentially safer than nasal vaccines. Despite these advantages, identification of appropriate adjuvant formulations remains a requirement for the development of sublingual vaccines. Here we show that supplementation of the EdTx adjuvant with a chemical inhibitor of a neutrophil function broadens B and T cell responses induced after sublingual immunization and promotes antigen-specific SIgA Abs.",

While this work was the first to establish an inverse relationship between the presence of neutrophils and production of IgA, the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effect of neutrophils on IgA production remained elusive. It was previously shown that neutrophil peptide defensins enhance IgG, but not IgA responses against nasally co-administered vaccine antigen17. The primary (or azurophilic) granules of neutrophils contain defensins, myeloperoxidase, lysozymes, and three serine proteases: neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and protease 312,18. We now show that inhibition of a single function of neutrophils can rescue the adjuvant activity of EdTx and promote IgA responses both in the blood stream and in mucosal tissues. This finding is significant because the use of a serine protease inhibitor might be a more realistic alternative to neutrophil depletion as a strategy for promoting IgA responses. It also raises the question of the mechanism behind neutrophil elastase limiting IgA production. Neutrophil elastase and the related serine proteases cathepsin G and proteinase 3, were shown to regulate cytokine responses through activation or degradation of cytokines, cytokine receptors, or toll-like receptor12,19. Our separate studies have shown that NEI induce the expression of IL-10 mRNA but also AID and BAFF responses by spleen cells in vitro20. Because IL-10 facilitates Ig class switching for production of IgA21 and regulate the expression of AID for induction of Ig CSR22, this may be a mechanism for enhanced IgA responses in mice sublingually immunized with EdTx in the presence of NEI.",

We now show that when added to an EdTx-based sublingual vaccine, NEI primarily promoted SIgA responses in mucosal secretions of the GI tract. No significant levels of IgA were measured in other mucosal secretions although IgG responses were significantly increased in vaginal washes. The best-described factors that regulate homing of immune cells into the gut are CCR9 and gut homing receptors \u03b14\u03b2723,24. These factors are induced through signals provided by retinoid acid, a product of myeloid cells in mucosal tissues23. To our knowledge, no study has examined whether neutrophils regulate expression of gut homing receptors. But it is worth noting that in conditions of normal homeostasis, neutrophils are not present in mucosal tissues where the concentration of IgA is the highest in the body. The observation that NEI primarily promotes SIgA in the gut suggests that it either directly stimulated retinoic acid production or stimulated cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6 and IL-21, which promote or enhance expression of gut homing receptors25,26.",

This is consistent with the previous report that elastase inhibits the maturation and function of dendritic cells, including expression of the costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD8627. Thus, the presence of NEI may have promoted the maturation of dendritic cells and their expression of BAFF and APRIL, and perhaps costimulatory molecules (i.e., CD40), for enhanced antibody production. Another important point revealed in the present study is that the presence of NEI improved the quality of antibody responses. Indeed, NEI increased the titers of high affinity IgG and IgA antibodies, an effect that translated into higher titers of anti-PA neutralizing antibodies. Our findings are in line with the recent report that neutrophils regulate germinal center formation in secondary lymphoid organs and production of autoreactive plasma cells in lupus28. Analysis of antigen-specific T helper cytokine responses provided some clues on how NEI improved the breath, the magnitude and the quality of antibody responses in mice immunized via the sublingual route with EdTx as adjuvant. We found that addition of NEI resulted in higher frequencies of Th1 cells producing IFN-\u03b3, Th2 cells producing IL-5 and IL-10, Th17 cells producing IL-17, and Tfh cells producing IL-21. This broad profile of Th cell cytokine responses has most likely contributed to increase B cell survival via signals from IL-5 and IL-1729\u201333. It is also consistent with the observation by others that neutrophils preferentially accumulate in proximity of T cells in secondary lymphoid organs during the early stage of lupus and that neutrophil depletion accelerate germinal center formation28. In our study, the NEI may have played the same role as neutrophil depletion and enhanced development of germinal centers and production of high affinity antibodies by facilitating differentiation of Tfh producing IL-21.",

It is also worth noting that NEI alone exhibited some adjuvant activity and enhanced IgG1 and IgA responses against the sublingually co-administered vaccine antigens. This effect does not appear to extend to other immunoglobulin isotypes/subclasses. Previous studies have established that after oral administration, the plasma concentration of the NEI Alvelestat peaked by 05\u20131.5 hrs and that it was eliminated thereafter34. Thus, the NEI is believed to act quickly after sublingual immunization and to be eliminated within 24 hrs. Future studies will investigate the underlying mechanisms and whether NEI can be used as a universal strategy for improving immune responses to sublingual vaccines regardless of the adjuvant or delivery system.",
