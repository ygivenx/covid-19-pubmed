Several theories have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of endometriosis [2\u20136]. It has been widely accepted that endometriosis originates from retrograde menstruation, wherein sloughed endometrial cells exit the uterus via the fallopian tubes [6]. Given the fact that regenerative capacity of the human endometrium is mediated by endometrial stem cells [7\u20139], recent studies have reported a correlation between aberrant stem-cell activity in the endometrium and endometriosis [10\u201314]. Several studies have reported increasing ectopic expression of stemness-related genes, including OCT4, in the endometria [15\u201317] and the upregulated OCT4 promoted the cell migration in human endometriosis [15]. However, the critical niche factors that regulate the OCT4 expression and cell migration in human endometriosis remain unclear.",

The growth factors that promote endometrial cell migration, including the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), are critical in human endometriosis [19, 21, 22]. TGF-\u03b2 is upregulated in several types of cancer [23\u201325]. TGF-\u03b2 promotes cell migration and invasion in breast and lung cancers in a Smad-dependent manner through the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [26\u201331]; in addition, it increases the expression levels of TWIST, N-CADHERIN, and VIMENTIN in cholangiocarcinoma cells [32]. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 regulates various biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, extracellular matrix formation, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis [33].",

It was hypothesized to contribute to the endometriosis development [34, 35]. As OCT4 is frequently up-regulated in endometriotic tissues [15\u201317], therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the roles of TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGF-\u03b2 R in human endometriosis by evaluating the expression profiles of OCT4 and TGF-\u03b2 RI in ectopic endometrial tissues. Furthermore, we examined the role of TGF-\u03b2I in OCT4 expression and identified the biological influence of OCT4 by knocking down OCT4 expression during TGF-\u03b2I treatment using human primary endometrium stromal cell as the in vitro model. Our data indicated that TGF-\u03b2I initiates the expressions of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4, and OCT4 expression may be a crucial underlying molecular mechanism of TGF-\u03b2I-stimulated cell migration in human endometriosis.",

S2 Table summarizes the primer sequences used for amplifications. Beta-2 microglobulin expression was used to normalize the qRT-PCR results.

Results from the wound-closure assay (Fig 4C) and transwell assay (Fig 4D) revealed that TGF-\u03b2I treatment significant increased cell migration ability when compared with the control group (P < .01 for wound-closure assay; and P < .001 for transwell assay). On the contrary, knockdown of OCT4 significantly decreased the TGF-\u03b2I-induced migratory activity (P < .01 for wound-closure assay and P < .001 for transwell assay) (Fig 4C and 4D). The cell proliferation under different experimental conditions in 24 h was shown in S2 Fig. Moreover, immunocytochemical analysis and confocal imaging revealed that knockdown of OCT markedly suppressed the TGF-\u03b2I-induced intracellular actin fiber extension and cell morphology change in the human endometriotic stromal cells when compared with the control group (Fig 4E). In summary, our results demonstrated a crucial role of the pluripotent transcriptional factor OCT4 in TGF-\u03b2I-stimulated cell migration in human endometrial cells.",

In a previous study, TGF-\u03b2-null females developed fewer and smaller peritoneal endometriosis lesions than did wild-type counterparts in a mouse endometriosis model [35]. Although TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI is hypothesized to induce the development of endometriosis by activating cell migration, the understanding of TGF-\u03b2/TGF-\u03b2 RI and stemness-related gene OCT4 in endometriosis remains to be elucidated. TGF-\u03b2 is upregulated in the peritoneal fluid of endometriosis patients [22], and our results revealed high TGF\u03b2-RI expression levels in the endometriosis tissue. Because of the higher TGF-\u03b2 concentration in endometriotic peritoneal fluid, we treated the human endometriotic cells with a higher dose of TGF-\u03b2 to demonstrate the TGF-\u03b2 effect on the increasing expression of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4, thereby resulting in stimulated cell migration in human endometriotic cells.",

The upregulation of OCT4 transcription in somatic tissues has been associated with the initiation of cancer stemness and metastasis [42, 43]. Emerging evidence suggests that tumor metastasis is strongly influenced by EMT which is a hallmark sign of cancer stemness [44]. Studies have demonstrated that the transcription factors TWIST, SNAIL, and SLUG regulate EMT and increase cell motility [44\u201347]. In support of the stemness and EMT, our previous report demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression levels of the OCT4 and EMT-related genes in ectopic endometriotic tissues, and the forced OCT4 expression promotes the cell migration in human endometriosis [15]. In advance of the previous findings, the present study results further demonstrated that there is a significant positive correlation of OCT4 with TGF-\u03b2 RI and TGF-\u03b2 RII (Fig 1 and S3 Fig); and the aberrant upregulation of TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI in human endometriotic cells increases cell migration through the induction of OCT4 expression (Figs 3 and 4). The OCT4 expression in ectopic endometrial cells, particularly in response to TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI signaling, may facilitate self-renewal and increase cell migration, initiating the development of endometriosis. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the recent findings that the risk of ovarian cancer was associated with aberrant TGF-\u03b2 signaling [48].",

In the present study, we further demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2I stimulates the OCT4 expression, and the OCT4 expressed in the endometriotic stromal cells, in turn, mediated the TGF-\u03b2I/TGF-\u03b2 RI -induced cell migration. In addition to TGF-\u03b2, IGF-I is another serum marker for human endometriosis [53]. Reportedly, patients with late-stage endometriosis exhibited significantly higher IGF-I levels than did those with early-stage endometriosis and healthy control participants, which suggests that IGF-I is a crucial mediator of the development and maintenance of endometriosis or its progression to an advanced-stage disease [53]. In support, our results showed that IGF-I tends to increase the OCT4 mRNA levels in human endometriotic stromal cells (Fig 3A). In consistence with these results, our previous study conducted using germline stem cells, demonstrated that the OCT4 expression was regulated by an IGF-IR-HIF-2\u03b1 signal loop in pluripotent mouse germline stem cells [54] and a IL-6-IGF-IR signal in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma [55].
