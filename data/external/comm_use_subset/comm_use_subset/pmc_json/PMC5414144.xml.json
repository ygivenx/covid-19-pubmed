Primary pathogens including bovine herpesvirus 1 (Bo-HV1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza 3 virus (BPIV-3), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and Mycoplasma bovis, are thought to be generally responsible for the onset of BRD [1, 4, 10\u201312] although recent viral metagenomic NGS studies suggest that there are many more uncharacterised BRD-associated viruses than was previously thought [13, 14]. BRD-associated viral and Mycoplasmal pathogens damage the lungs by causing immunosuppression, ciliary dysfunction and cellular necrosis [15, 16]. This damage allows proliferation and colonisation by secondary bacterial pathogens, commonly including Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis and Trueperella pyogenes, which are normally commensal in the nasopharyngeal region of cattle [1, 7, 11, 17\u201319]. These bacteria evade the lung\u2019s remaining immune defences and their virulence factors cause progression of the disease if left untreated [7, 11, 15, 16].",

PCR has been demonstrated to be a more sensitive method than culture for identification of bacteria in bovine pneumonic lung tissue [27, 28].

For this we analysed DNA from post-mortem cranial lung lobe and mediastinal lymph node tissue from beef and dairy calves with BRD diagnosed as the cause of death, and from clinically healthy Holstein-Friesian (H-F) calves. We found highly abundant 16S sequence for which the closest match was Leptotrichiaceae. This putative Leptotrichiaceae 16S sequence was present in lung and lymph node tissue from fatal BRD cases and in lung lesions from clinically healthy calves but was absent in lesion-free lungs from clinically healthy calves. To our knowledge this is the first report of detection of this putative Leptotrichiaceae species in bovine lung lesions in cattle with BRD and also the first report of NGS 16S amplicon analysis of lung tissue and lung-associated lymph nodes in cattle with BRD.",

Bacteriological culture, virological and/or bacteriological PCR and histology for identification of aetiological agents (Table 1 and Additional file 1) were performed at the RVLs. In all cases, lung tissue samples were harvested from lesions (lesions were defined as macroscopic consolidation or abscessation of lung tissue) present on the cranial lobes of the lung. Approximately 1 g of each of these tissues was collected from each calf (comprising 13 beef and dairy breeds) (Table 1). Six of these post-mortem lung tissue samples were frozen at -80 \u00b0C immediately following collection. The remaining lung and lymph node post-mortem tissue samples were cut into slices less than 0.5 cm thick, placed in RNALater RNA Stabilization Reagent (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and subsequently stored at -20 \u00b0C, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Table 1).\n",

PhiX sequence was from the pre-prepared non-indexed PhiX V3 library (supplied by Illumina) which was added, as a quality control, to the microbial DNA-enriched library prior to sequencing on the MiSeq. Fluorescence from the bases in the non-indexed PhiX clusters bleeds into the fluorescence in the adjacent indexed clusters. Additional file 10 contains the sequences of the contigs which aligned to bacterial sequences.

Leptotrichiaceae species are not currently associated with BRD and have not been previously described in lungs or mediastinal lymph nodes of cattle. All members of this bacterial family are facultative to obligate anaerobic Gram-negative rods [54]. They can occur in anoxic environments as well as oral and intestinal environments [54]. Although little is known about their role in disease, mainly due to the difficulties associated with their isolation and identification, they have been suggested as emerging pathogens [55]. A member of this family within the genus Leptotrichia was identified in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from an elderly man with pneumonia and was hypothesized to be responsible for the disease [56]. Additionally, a member of the genus Sneathia was hypothesised to be responsible for late-onset bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in a lung transplant recipient [57]. Furthermore, species within the Leptotrichia genus have been isolated from blood cultures of patients with lesions in the oral mucosa [55] and from blood cultures from patients with anaerobic bloodstream infection receiving high-dose chemotherapy [58].",

To do this we partially sequenced the genome of this unknown species of bacteria by metagenomic shotgun sequencing and de novo assembly of a bacterial DNA enriched post-mortem lung tissue sample. From this we obtained three bacterial sequence contigs which were 2647 bp, 1376 bp and 744 bp long. The 744 bp contig corresponded to a known BRD-associated bacterial species, Histophilus somni. A BLAST search against the NCBI cultured bacteria database showed the 2647 bp and 1376 bp contigs were most similar (92 and 93% identity respectively) to Sneathia amnii. A BLAST search against the nr/nt collection showed that part of one of the Leptotrichiaceae contigs (67%) was 100% identical to an uncultured clone. As this uncultured clone (GenBank: KR514404.1, submitted by Lu, J) was obtained from the bovine reproductive tract of farm animals at University College Dublin, it appears to be a novel species that is present in at least two microbiomes in cattle. From the present study it is not possible to infer whether this novel Leptotrichiaceae species is pathogenic and causing lung lesions in cattle or wheteher it is merely able to grow opportunistically in the relatively anaerobic lung lesions (some Leptotrichiaceae are facultative anaerobes) which have been caused by known pathogens. In lung tissue samples from the calves in this study, the Leptotrichiaceae OTU always co-occurred with either Pasteurellaceae, Mycoplasma or Fusobacterium OTUs.",

We have confirmed that the cranial region of bovine lungs are not sterile environments and that some bacteria associated with BRD can be present within the lung and lymph node tissues of clinically healthy calves as well as those calves which were suffering from BRD.
