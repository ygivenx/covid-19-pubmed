            "text": "The steroid\u2010induced necrosis of the femoral head (SINFH) is a devastating, irreversible, and disabling disease developing following steroid therapy1. The functions of the hip joint are markedly impaired when the femoral head collapses. Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy is the most common cause of INFH2. The onset of SINFH is within several months following the administration of steroids. Due to ischemia, patients have no typical symptoms when SINFH occurs, but it is accompanied by pain and collapse of particular areas of bone. Approximately 5%\u201325% of patients using GC develop SINFH in the legs. Notably, in China, 53.5% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome who were prescribed GC developed femoral head osteonecrosis, and SINFH comprises approximately half of non\u2010traumatic femoral head necrosis. However, the pathogenesis of this disease remains controversial and the various theories explaining SINFH pathogenesis are predominantly classified into the osteoporosis theory, the lipid metabolism disorders theory, the vasculopathy theory, the intraosseous hypertension theory, and the GC cytotoxicity theory3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.",

            "text": "Intravascular microthrombosis or extravascular compression leads to blockage of microvessels in the femoral head and ischemic necrosis. Many studies have shown that there is a tendency of coagulation and low fibrinolysis in patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head9, 10. The levels of membrane microparticles were significantly heightened after methylprednisolone treatment, which indicated that increased levels of membrane microparticles may be related to hypercoagulability, thrombosis, and inflammation in the microcirculation, and play an important role in SINFH11. Many studies have shown that \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin is an important indicator for the detection of thrombotic diseases, and it plays an important role in both coagulation and fibrinolysis systems12. \u03b12\u2010Macroglobulin has been found to enhance thrombin activity and to inhibit plasmin activity; that is, \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin plays a role in regulating coagulation and fibrin hydrolysis13. \u03b12\u2010Macroglobulin is indicated to significantly increase the regenerative capacity of plasma plasmin, while the complex formed by the binding of \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibits the activity of heparin, resulting in a hypercoagulable state of the blood14. Chen et al.15 confirmed that the level of \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin in bone tissue of patients with steroid\u2010induced femoral head necrosis was significantly decreased, which may be related to the hypercoagulability of the blood, hyperlipidemia, free radicals, and degradation of matrix metalloproteinase. The inhibition of thrombin plays a particularly important role. A study included \u03bcCT and histological findings suggested that elevated \u03b12M serum level is suitable as an indicative biomarker for early GC\u2010induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in rodents, and \u03b12M plays a role in the host reparative response to GC\u2010associated effects16.",

The obstruction in blood supply is produced by intravascular coagulation and fat emboli. Fat cell hypertrophy and osteocyte apoptosis destroy the fat cells and osteocytes. These changes result in the compromised vasculature of bone and bone marrow. This pathology leads to IBN, resulting in the failure of the mechanical strength of bone, while the diagnosis of this disorder still relies on image examination, which often fails to detect lesions in the early stage.

Small amounts of \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin are also produced by a number of other cells, including lung fibroblasts, macrophages, astrocytes, and tumor cells18, 19. The \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin functions as a broad irreversible proteinase inhibitor and is involved in various physiological processes20, 21. The \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin regulates several key factors of SINFH. The conformational change can activate \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin, resulting in exposure of binding sites for its cell surface receptor, including the low\u2010density lipoprotein receptor\u2010related protein. Upon binding, \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin\u2013proteinase complexes from the extracellular matrix are rapidly removed, which blocks lipid catabolism22. The \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin modulates blood coagulation. As reported, \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin significantly enhanced plasmin generation23. However, \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin binds vascular endothelial growth factor and the resultant \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin complex inhibits heparin activity, leading to elevated coagulation. Human \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin has been verified to effectively decrease the release of superoxide radicals by polynuclear leukocytes following radiation. The activity of superoxide dismutase in red cells can also be increased. The free radicals and MMP imbalance exist in the pathological process of SINFH13, 24. Along with those findings, the present study showed that \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin was significantly lower in the bone tissue of patients with SINFH. Lower \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin may affect the process of SINFH through these aspects. Consistent with the bone tissue, the serum \u03b12\u2010macroglobulin level was also decreased.",

            "text": "A few limitations of this study should be mentioned here. First, this was a study with a small sample size and patients included were from a single center, which might affect both the accuracy and generalizability of these findings. No correlation analysis between these experimental indicators and stages of SINFH was performed. Thus, evidence is still weak for \u03b1M2 being a grading diagnostic indicator of SINFH. Further studies should focus on establishing a stable late stage SINFH model and further exploration of the mechanism of \u03b1M2 with SINFH. Although more studies are needed to clarify the roles of \u03b1M2 in SINFH, we believe that the results of this study will provide new clues for developing novel diagnostic indicators and preventive strategies for SINFH.",
