The mortality rate from sepsis is 10\u201320%, and the mortality rate from severe sepsis is 20\u201350% [1]; these rates correspond to those reported in surveys of Chinese epidemics [3]. Because the disease is severely life threatening, the pathogenesis, prognostic factors and modes of therapy are of great interest to both clinicians and academic researchers. Recently, some studies showed that the individual genetic background is associated with the personal inflammatory response and also influences the pathology. Genes with related polymorphisms include the antigen recognition pathway protein [4], [5], proteins associated with blood biochemistry [6], pro- [7], [8] and anti-inflammatory cytokines [9], [10] and others.",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3, a member of the interferon family, plays an important role in inflammation and acquired immunity in infection [11]. Initially, IFN-\u03b3 was presumed to only interfere with viral replication [12], but subsequent experimental studies showed that it also protects the individual against bacterial [13], [14] and fungal pathogens [15]. The most important function of IFN-\u03b3 is its macrophage-activating function, which up-regulates the expression of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) I [16], [17] and II [18], [19], which are involved in the antigen processing and presentation pathways. IFN-\u03b3 also mediates functions such as leukocyte attraction [16], [20], maturation and differentiation, natural killer (NK) cell activity [21] and immunoglobulin (Ig) production and class switching in B cells [16]. In sepsis, IFN-\u03b3 is an important regulator of infection and inflammation; it is released in small amounts during the initial period of infection, and the amount released increases during the inflammation period [22]\u2013[24]. It is postulated that suppressing IFN-\u03b3 to near normal levels during the early period of inflammation may benefit the host by preventing bacteria outflow [22]. Increased IFN-\u03b3 levels during the later period [22]\u2013[24] may be beneficial by stimulating the body\u2019s defense system [16].",

Some of the disease-associated SNPs are functional. The SNPs in the 5\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) are translation-level regulators [26], [31], [34], [35], and some SNPs in the introns may function to modify mRNA expression [36]\u2013[39]. Both the minor allele frequency (MAF) and the influence of the SNPs on disease pathology vary among populations. In addition to IFN-\u03b3 participating in the key immune response and sepsis development, its SNPs are functional and are related to immunologic disease. There have been few reports in the literature regarding the epidemiology of IFN-\u03b3 SNPs in relation to sepsis, with the exception of one study examining the association between intron 1 polymorphisms and trauma due to sepsis [40].",

            "text": "Sepsis, especially severe sepsis, is a great hazard to human health, as indicated by its increasing incidence and the higher than average mortality rates in intensive care units (ICU) [1], [41]. According to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), sepsis is defined as having at least two criteria of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in addition to confirmed or suspected pathogenic infection. SIRS refers to a series of clinical symptoms involved in infection, such as core body temperature >38\u00b0C or <36\u00b0C, heart rate > = 90 bpm, respirations > = 20/min (or partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood <32 mmHg), white blood cell > = 12,000/ul or  = <4,000/ul or >10% immature forms. [2] Severe sepsis is marked by acute organ dysfunction (including hypoperfusion and hypotension) that is caused by sepsis [2]. Patient scores on APACHE II and SOFA, which are two widely accepted evaluation systems [42]\u2013[44] based on clinical indictors, were considered important indexes associated with sepsis development and outcome. We focused on patients with pneumonia-induced sepsis and age- and sex-matched healthy controls, and pneumonia was regarded as a common precipitating factor of sepsis [45]. We collected patient information and grouped patients by clinical severity, APACHE II score and SOFA score to examine the genetic factors related to the incidence of sepsis and its clinical presentation. All the patients in our study presented with community acquired pneumonia, not acquired in a hospital or a nursing home residence. Many published papers have examined the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and sepsis. These studies focused on immune cell surface markers [4], [5] and cytokines [6]\u2013[10], which are important for the immune system, and functional genetic polymorphisms. Our work sought to examine functional IFN-\u03b3 polymorphisms in relation to pneumonia-induced sepsis.",

            "text": "The function of IFN-\u03b3 on infection and inflammation is multifaceted. IFN-\u03b3 is produced by most of the immune cells, including NK cells, T lymphocytes and macrophages [46], [47], and is regulated by cytokines IL-12 and IL-18, which are secreted after the antigen is presented [48], [49]. While some experiments have shown that IFN-\u03b3 is essential for the host immune response to pathogens [50], [51], the investigation of IFN-\u03b3-deficient patients highlights the functions of IFN-\u03b3 in stimulating the inflammatory response and regulating the immune system by demonstrating increased susceptibility to intracellular but not extracellular pathogens, with some decreased immunity as demonstrated by neutrophil mobilization and NK cell activation [52]. However, there are opposing opinions regarding the function of IFN-\u03b3 in sepsis following studies in non-human models, including studies in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced shock and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) models in the rat. These reports stated that IFN-\u03b3 could confer susceptibility and affect the outcome. There was evidence of a trend in the plasma level as well as evidence that antibody-mediated blockade of IFN-\u03b3 improved the survival rate in an animal model [22]\u2013[24], [53], as IFN-\u03b3 deficiency decreases the pathogen burden [53].",

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis show the +874 and +3234 SNPs were in strong LD (r2 = 0.894), which partly agrees with surveys from the northern Chinese population [60].

As we expected, the haplotype results were consistent with the functional IFN-\u03b3 research in sepsis. The CTT haplotype was associated with protection against sepsis initiation but marginal susceptibility to progression to severe sepsis(P = 0.054). The TAC haplotype.was associated with susceptibility to sepsis incidence and protection against progression to severe sepsis. There were three haplotypes for the \u22121616, +874 and +3234 SNPs. The TAC haplotype composed by three high-expression IFN-\u03b3 alleles was the most frequent combination, while the CTT haplotype was the least frequent. Our results suggest that individuals with a genetic background associated with high IFN-\u03b3 expression are more susceptible to sepsis, but once they have sepsis they are less likely to experience progression to severe sepsis. Individuals with low IFN-\u03b3 expressions are less susceptible to sepsis, which is consistent with the results of the animal experiments.",

While the patients in our study had pneumonia-induced sepsis, and some reports suggest that environmental conditions can significantly influence pneumonia [61], [62], we expect our results to be less affected by environment factors because they are difficult to adjust for. As we expected, patients grouped by severity showed significant differences in age and APACHE II and SOFA scores, which corresponds to epidemiologic studies of sepsis, though the mortality from sepsis in our study was 40% compared to the reported rate of 10\u201320% [1], [3]. Due to this difference, we could conclude that the distribution of IFN-\u03b3 SNPs in relation to sepsis outcome is only applicable to our region.",
