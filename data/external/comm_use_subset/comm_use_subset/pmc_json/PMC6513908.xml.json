            "text": "Neutrophil infiltration under conditions of sterile inflammation can contribute to tissue injury. Neutrophils are transiently detected in the brain after stroke since they are rapidly attracted to the injured brain peaking between 1 and 3 days post-ischemia [10, 23, 24, 51]. Compelling evidence suggests that neutrophils are contributors to tissue damage after ischemic stroke [35, 44, 51, 61, 64], in spite of the fact that diverse experimental strategies inhibiting neutrophil activation or depleting neutrophils provided conflicting results [16, 61]. Likely, the differences between experimental studies depend on the efficacy and potential side effects of the diverse neutrophil depleting or inhibiting strategies, status of capillary reperfusion, lesion severity, and integrity of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Moreover, several aspects of neutrophil infiltration after acute ischemic brain damage remain controversial. Neutrophils accumulate in perivascular spaces in murine and human strokes [17, 55]. The presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma has been reported in rodent models of permanent ischemia [23, 51, 55], but it is more controversial in experimental models of transient ischemia [17, 64]. Several studies reported the presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma in post-mortem samples of patients deceased between day 1 and 5 [55], or 3 days after stroke onset but not at other time points [56, 76]. In other studies, neutrophils were not detected in the brain parenchyma of stroke patients [17]. Therefore, the molecular determinants underlying perivascular neutrophil accumulation and the conditions facilitating the potential access of neutrophils to the brain parenchyma need further clarification.",

            "text": "The observation that microglia phagocytose neutrophils in the ischemic brain [50\u201352] led us to hypothesize that microglia function may be critical to explain neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain tissue. Microglial cells react to brain ischemia in different ways depending on the regional location and temporal course of the lesion. Microglial cells are vulnerable to ischemia and previous reports showed death of microglia after oxygen and glucose deprivation in tissue slices [18] and cell cultures [41, 73]. In addition, microglial reduction has been reported after transient MCAo [43], and microglial dysfunction and loss was detected in classical neuropathological studies of brain ischemia in rodents and primates [3, 4]. Classical histopathological studies have shown long-lasting microgliosis surrounding the infarction several days after ischemic stroke onset. However, the progression of this reaction from the very acute phase of stroke is less precisely determined mainly due to the fact that microglia and infiltrating macrophages show many common features and markers leading to the frequent terminology of microglia/macrophages to describe the mononuclear myeloid cell reaction that follows stroke. Microglia have a unique transcriptomic signature distinguishable from that of macrophages or monocytes [7, 32]. Therefore, reactive microglia and infiltrating macrophages likely play different functions in the injured brain tissue. Current developments allow the distinction between these cells with antibodies against more specific microglia markers [1, 7], availability of fluorescent reporter mice [74], or transfer of fluorescent reporter leukocytes [46]. By exploiting some of these novel experimental possibilities, we investigated the neutrophil\u2013microglia crosstalk after brain ischemia. The results show that microglial cells effectively remove brain-infiltrating neutrophils, hence microglia dysfunction or death is associated with neutrophil accumulation into the injured brain tissue.",

Homozygous CatchupIVM (Ly6G\u2212/\u2212) mice were crossed with Cx3Cr1gfp/gfp mice to obtain double heterozygous mice with red fluorescent neutrophils and green fluorescent microglia [50, 75]. We also obtained cells from DsRed mice constitutively expressing the red fluorescent protein DsRed under the control of the actin promoter [8]. Wild-type mice were obtained from a commercial source (Janvier, France). Mice were maintained in the animal house of the School of Medicine of the University of Barcelona under controlled SPF conditions.

Cells were subjected to a time-lapse study while maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All images (3\u20134 z sections) were acquired using a APO 63 \u00d7 (numerical aperture 1.3) glycerol immersion objective lens, pinhole set at 1.5 Airy units. Images of CMFDA and DsRed were acquired sequentially line by line using 488 and 561 laser lines and detection ranges at 500\u2013550 and 570\u2013650, respectively. Simultaneously, bright field images were acquired. Multiposition confocal images were acquired every 4 min during 12\u201314 h, with an image matrix of 512 \u00d7 512 pixel; 600 Hz; 2 \u00d7 line average and autofocus control.

In every frame, manual tracking of neutrophils was performed using the MTrackJ plugin [45] to identify phagocytosis of neutrophils by microglial cells. We studied in parallel four wells per genotype (CSF1R+/+ or CSF1R+/\u2212 microglial cells) in each independent experiment and conducted five independent experiments. The analysis was performed in a blinded fashion by assigning a code to each video that did not reveal the identity of the genotype.",

Most myeloid cells infiltrating the ipsilateral brain hemisphere were DsRed+ 4 days after MCAo, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1a, b), and they were preferentially located in the lesion core where the expression of GFAP is lost (Fig. 1c). We stained microglia with anti-P2RY12 antibodies [7, 28, 59] and verified that the infiltrating DsRed+ cells were not P2RY12+. Microglia and infiltrating DsRed+ leukocytes co-existed at the border of infarction, whereas microglia were abundant at the infarct periphery but scarce in the core of the lesion (Fig. 1d\u2013f). Microglia acquired a reactive phenotype at the periphery and border of infarction with thicker ramifications compared to microglia of the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, microglial cells in the infarcted core showed a dystrophic morphology since the cell body became smaller and there were only a few long ramifications showing an appearance of discontinuity as if they were broken or beaded, and the density appeared to be reduced (Fig. 1d).",

Next, we analysed microglia morphology (Online Resource 4) in the contralateral hemisphere, and in different zones of the ipsilateral hemisphere, i.e. periphery and infarcted core, 4 days after MCAo (Fig. 2c\u2013h). Shape descriptors showed increased circularity and reduced area of microglia in the ipsilateral hemisphere that was more marked in cells located in the core region (Fig. 2c, d). A Sholl analysis showed that ischemia reduced the number of ramifications, and maximal intersections per microglial cell, and again the changes were greater in the core (Fig. 2e, f). Analysis of 3D-reconstructions of the cells showed a reduced volume and higher sphericity index after ischemia, particularly in the core (Fig. 2g, h). Furthermore, the quantification of cells per area showed that while microglial cell density increased in the periphery, it was reduced in the core of the lesion (Fig. 2i). This result was confirmed by flow cytometry after excising the core and periphery of the ipsilateral hemisphere and mirror regions of the contralateral hemisphere 1 and 4 days after MCAo. Microglia cell number was severely reduced in the core of the lesion at 1 and 4 days post-ischemia (Fig. 2j). Altogether, these findings show that microglial cells are sensitive to persistent ischemic conditions and are lost in the infarcted core.",

By cell counting, we calculated that 26.8 \u00b1 8.8% (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3 mice) of the microglial cells at the periphery of infarction incorporated BrdU suggesting microglial proliferation, in agreement with previous reports [14, 40]. In contrast, microglial cells were BrdU\u2212 in the contralateral non-ischemic hemisphere. Notably, BrdU was found in ramified microglial cells suggesting that microglia could undergo cell division without regression of their differentiation status. We extended the results to the human brain by showing an increased number of microglial cells and proliferating Ki67+ microglia at the periphery of infarction in post-mortem human brain tissue of stroke patients (Fig. 3d\u2013g). We also found reduced microglial cell numbers in the lesion core of stroked human brains (Fig. 3d) thus supporting that the findings in mice might be relevant to human stroke.",

Indeed, we observed numerous microglial cell processes surrounding the blood vessels and getting into contact with infiltrating DsRed+ leukocytes by sampling the DsRed+ cells adjacent to the vascular endothelium (Online Resource 5). Furthermore, we detected microglial processes surrounding DsRed+ cells suggestive of engulfment of leukocytes (Fig. 4a\u2013c; Online Resource 6). 3D-reconstructions of confocal images showed phagosomes completely wrapping DsRed+ leukocytes (Fig. 4b, c). The CSF1R signaling pathway is critical for survival of microglia and maintenance of their functions [2], including endocytic processes [60]. Consequently, by interfering with microglial function after oral administration of the CSF1R inhibitor GW2580 [12] for 4 days, we found more DsRed+ cells at the periphery of infarction not surrounded by microglia or in apparent contact with microglia, suggesting that microglia dysfunction impaired the process of phagocytosis of leukocytes (Fig. 4d).",

We isolated microglia from adult mouse brains, cultured the cells in vitro for 7 days, and exposed them to freshly isolated bone marrow neutrophils (stained with CMFDA) to study phagocytosis. Microglial cells phagocytosed neutrophils in vitro (Fig. 6a, b, and time-lapse microscopy movie in Online Resource 8). By following neutrophil trajectories along time (time-lapse microscopy movie in Online Resource 9), we counted the number of neutrophils phagocytosed by microglia. We validated that allogenicity in the phagocytosis experimental design was not interfering with the assay by comparing phagocytosis of neutrophils obtained from different mice with the phagocytosis of neutrophils from the same mouse. We found no differences, ruling out prime effects of allogenicity in the phagocytosis of neutrophils by microglia (Online Resource 10). Given that we observed signs of impaired phagocytosis of neutrophils in vivo after ischemia in mice after short-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor (Fig. 4d), we investigated in vitro the role of CSF1R in this process. To this end, we obtained microglia from adult mice with heterozygous CSF1R+/\u2212 microglia (obtained by crossing CX3CR1cre/ERT2 with CSF1Rflox/+ mice). Less neutrophils were phagocytosed by CSF1R+/\u2212 microglia compared to CSF1R+/+ microglia, as assessed by time-lapse microscopy where we counted the neutrophils phagocytosed by microglia during the 14-h duration of the experiment (Fig. 6c). In addition, CSF1R+/\u2212 microglia showed reduced phagocytic activity in a phagocytosis assay with fluorescent beads (Fig. 6d\u2013f). We then studied the potential relevance of these findings for human cells by obtaining human microglia from the post-mortem brain of an ischemic stroke patient deceased 5 days after stroke onset. After maintaining the human cells in culture for 7 days, we exposed the cells to neutrophils obtained from blood of a donor control subject. We observed very active phagocytosis of neutrophils (Fig. 6g, h and time-lapse microscopy movie in Online Resource 11). By immunofluorescence after the ex vivo assay, we detected P2RY12 expression in the cells and observed that they contained material from neutrophils (Fig. 6i).",

PLX5622 diet caused a strong reduction (90%) of the microglia population (Fig. 8a) but did not affect blood leukocyte counts (Online Resource 12 shows the gating strategy and cell quantifications are shown in Online Resource 13), in agreement with previous reports [20, 70]. However, we detected a reduction of a minor subset of blood Ly6C\u2212 monocytes (Online Resource 13), which is dependent on CSF1R [39]. In brain tissue, PLX5622 diet reduced the numbers of infiltrating monocytes (40%) and F4/80+ macrophages (60%) versus the control diet 4 days post-ischemia (Online Resource 14), in agreement with previous findings suggesting a role for microglia in the recruitment of monocytes into the brain [20]. In contrast, the PLX5622 diet increased the numbers of neutrophils in the brain tissue after ischemia, as assessed by flow cytometry at day 4 (Fig. 8b). Immunofluorescence in CX3CR1cre/ERT2:R26-tdT mice showed extravasated neutrophils that seemed more abundant in the absence of microglia (Fig. 8c, d). By counting the number of neutrophils located either in the parenchyma or associated with blood vessels (hence not crossing the parenchymal basal lamina) we found an increase in the percentage of parenchymal neutrophils in the absence of microglia 1 and 4 days post-ischemia (Fig. 8e). Of note, neutrophils were often observed on the basement membrane of capillaries (Fig. 8d) and venules (Fig. 8f) suggesting a possible interaction of these cells with basal lamina components. In line with this, microglia depletion increased the size of the ischemic lesion (Fig. 8g), further supporting a beneficial effect of microglia at the periphery of the infarction.",

            "text": "This study supports the concept that microglia phagocytose and remove neutrophils after brain ischemia [14, 50\u201352] and demonstrates that neutrophil accumulation in the brain parenchyma is associated with reduced microglial phagocytic activity, attributable to ischemia-induced microglial cell dysfunction due to loss or dystrophy. Morphometric analysis of microglia showed changes in the periphery of the lesion compatible with microglial reactivity and similar to those reported [27]. Overall, morphological changes of microglia within the lesion core were larger than in the periphery, for instance regarding the notable loss of ramifications and reduced cell size. Such profound morphological changes of microglia in the lesion core might indicate a further process of transformation from reactive microglia to dystrophic microglia, potentially associated with cell dysfunction. Furthermore, we found reduced microglial cell numbers in the core of infarction. While our results support microglial degeneration in the infarcted core, microglial cells proliferated and accumulated at the periphery of infarction in mouse and human brain, in agreement with previous findings in the mouse brain [14, 40]. These reactive microglial cells at the periphery of infarction phagocytosed neutrophils, suggesting that the phagocytic activity of microglia prevented neutrophil accumulation in this region. Accordingly, the numbers of neutrophils were higher in the core than the periphery of the lesion. Microglial activity and survival are critically dependent on CSF1R [12]. Consequently, drug-induced inhibition of CSF1R or genetic reduction of CSF1R expression in microglia impaired their phagocytic capacity in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies reported that CSF-1 promotes phagocytosis of Ab1\u201342 peptide by primary human microglia in vitro [62], and it regulates cell motility in macrophages [58]. CSF1R is a tyrosine kinase that upon activation shows phosphorylation of several intracellular tyrosine residues [77]. Upon activation, CSF1R associates with several signaling molecules, notably phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [58]. CSF1R also activates Akt [11], and it induces ERK1/2-mediated signaling in microglia [9]. Akt [22, 67] and ERK1/2 [19] are involved in the phagocytic process. However, the specific signaling molecules downstream of CSF1R participating in phagocytosis in microglia after brain ischemia, and the precise step(s) of the phagocytic process affected by CSFR1 remain to be identified. Microglia depletion induced by long-term inhibition of CSF1R in vivo [15, 33, 65, 69] increased the numbers of neutrophils in the ischemic brain tissue, further supporting the view that microglial cells contribute to neutrophil removal.",

            "text": "Neutrophils are attracted to the injured brain after acute stroke [10, 23, 30, 31, 50, 51]. Thereby, neutrophils adhere to venules and migrate through the vessel wall to reach perivascular spaces [17]. In addition, neutrophils access perivascular spaces of penetrating cortical vessels from the leptomeninges [55]. Accumulation of neutrophils in the leptomeninges might be due to extravasation from pial vessels. In addition, neutrophil migration from the skull bone marrow through direct anatomic connections [29] might explain the presence of neutrophils in the subarachnoid space, although migration of neutrophils from there to perivascular spaces of cortical vessels still needs further investigation. Subpial neutrophils are separated from the brain parenchyma by the basement membrane and glia limitans. Likewise, the parenchymal basal lamina and surrounding astrocyte end-feet separate perivascular cells from the brain parenchyma. Interestingly, we observed ramifications of microglial cells apparently crossing the basal lamina suggesting the possibility that reactive microglia might sample the perivascular space and also the subpial space after brain ischemia. Using intravital microscopy, we previously found evidence that microglia phagocytosed neutrophils before they extravasated to the brain parenchyma [50, 51]. However, further studies are required to demonstrate whether microglia can really cross the external cortical basement membrane after brain ischemia. Although we detected engulfment of complete cells by microglia, some of the images suggest that microglia may take portions of the neutrophils while they are located in the perivascular or subpial spaces, potentially through a process of trogocytosis [71].",

            "text": "The blood vessel glycocalyx and basement membrane composition varies between organs and inflammatory conditions suggesting that leukocytes may have to use diverse strategies to access different inflamed tissues [53]. In the brain, neutrophils cross the endothelial cell layer and the endothelial basal lamina of venules to reach the perivascular spaces after ischemia [17]. Then, they accumulate in the perivascular spaces because they do not seem to readily cross the parenchymal basal lamina [17], at least not at the same pace as they transmigrate through the former layers. However, the precise molecular determinants of this process remain to be identified. The different molecular composition of the two layers of basal lamina surrounding the perivascular spaces, local molecular diversity, and the finding that certain basal lamina components inhibit leukocyte transmigration [63], might explain why neutrophils have more difficulty to cross the parenchymal than the endothelial basal lamina after brain ischemia. In a model of transient ischemia, there is evidence suggesting that neutrophils are kept in the perivascular spaces without infiltrating the brain parenchyma [17], whereas other studies suggested that neutrophils reach the brain parenchyma [64]. It is plausible that stroke severity, status of microglia function, and time point of the study are critical determinants of the presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. Neutrophils located in the perivascular spaces might damage the basement membrane by releasing proteolytic enzymes and/or undergoing NETosis [55]. However, at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that neutrophils gained access to the brain parenchyma in a passive fashion after loss of vessel integrity in the ischemic core. Several lines of evidence support that after brain ischemia neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes, promote matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, and cause BBB breakdown [25, 35, 36, 57, 66, 72]. Accordingly, blocking neutrophils or neutrophil-derived MMP-9 is markedly protective in models of systemic inflammation and stroke, e.g. [35, 44]. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of neutrophil elastase or genetic deficiency of this enzyme reduced BBB disruption and vasogenic edema after transient MCAo [64] suggesting that neutrophils contributed to vascular damage following stroke.",

            "text": "In this study we showed that, after permanent ischemia, neutrophils gained access to the brain parenchyma of the lesion core when it was already severely damaged and microglia was lost due to persistent ischemia. Under these conditions, parenchymal neutrophils might be bystanders of severe tissue damage. Therefore, it is likely that preventing the access of neutrophils to the brain parenchyma in this model would not have a major impact on the size of the brain lesion since the damage is already established by the time the cells reach the parenchyma and the core of infarction will not recover. This possibility agrees with the finding that inhibition or deficiency of neutrophil elastase was not protective in models of permanent MCAo [64]. In contrast, inhibiting microglial phagocytic activity in this model might bear negative effects by favoring neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic periphery. Accordingly, detrimental effects of neutrophils became apparent in our study after microglia depletion causing an abnormal increase in neutrophils and larger ischemic lesions. A limitation of our study is that we did not assess stroke outcome in the long term. Future work should investigate how microglia depletion affects the progression of the ischemic brain lesion and the neurological deficits. The results highlight an aspect of microglia phagocytic function that may be beneficial for the ischemic tissue. Nonetheless, several mechanisms can contribute to the detrimental effect of microglia depletion and CSF1R deficiency. For instance, pioneer studies demonstrated increased ischemic lesions related to reduced production of neurotrophic factors after depleting proliferating microglia [38], and neuroprotective functions mediated by CSF1R [47]. Moreover, we previously identified that absence of microglia significantly augmented infarct size in a model of transient ischemia, in part mediated by dysregulation of neuronal activity [65]. The latter model caused moderate leukocyte infiltration and we failed to observe a significant impact of microglia depletion on BBB injury and leukocyte recruitment, at least at the times examined [65]. In contrast to the findings suggesting beneficial effects of microglia in brain ischemia, several lines of evidence support that the phagocytic activity of microglia could exert negative effects by removing viable neurons through phagoptosis [5, 6, 48, 49]. It is possible that any negative consequences of phagoptosis of neurons might predominate under mild ischemic conditions where the inflammatory response is low, vascular integrity is preserved, and neutrophil attraction to the brain is negligible.",

Severe ischemic conditions induce local microglia loss/dystrophy facilitating the presence of neutrophils in perivascular spaces first and in the brain parenchyma later. Overall, this study shows that reactive microglial cells phagocytose and remove neutrophils, whereas microglial loss or dysfunction enhances neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic lesion. Our results, hence, suggest that microglia function is critical to prevent neutrophil infiltration to the brain parenchyma and to minimize the negative impact of neutrophils in the vascular bed after ischemic stroke.",

Microglia is shown in red, neutrophils in green (Ly6G+), the vascular basal lamina is stained with Pan-laminin (blue), and nuclei (DAPI) are shown in white. The absence of microglia is associated with an increased presence of extravasated neutrophils (arrowheads). d Is a magnified image showing extravasated neutrophils after a PLX5622-containing diet. e, f Distribution of neutrophils in parenchymal versus perivascular or intravascular locations, as assessed by cell counting in brain sections immunostained with Ly6G, pan-laminin and To-Pro3. Mice treated with the PLX5622 diet show a higher (Mann\u2013Whitney test) percentage of parenchymal neutrophils 1 day (**p = 0.004) and 4 days (**p = 0.006) post-ischemia (n = 5\u20137 mice per group). f Illustrates the previous staining after PLX5622 diet. g Brain lesion volume was measured with T2w MRI 24 h post-ischemia in both diet groups (n = 9 per group). The brain lesion was larger in mice depleted of microglia (Mann\u2013Whitney test, *p = 0.031). Scale bar 20 \u03bcm (c); 10 \u03bcm (e, f)",
