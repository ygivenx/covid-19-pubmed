            "text": "CoV infect a wide range of host species and cell types, but only six CoV are known to cause disease in humans [1]. Four human coronaviruses, HCoV\u2011229E, HCoV\u2011OC43, HCoV\u2011NL63 and HCoV\u2011HKU1, are mainly associated with upper respiratory infections, while severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV may cause serious pathology in the lower respiratory tract, with acute lung injury, respiratory failure and death occurring in a significant number of infected individuals [1]. Lung biopsies obtained from SARS patients or infected primates consistently showed increased expression levels of (i) proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin(IL)-1, TNF and IL-6, (ii) chemokines, such as IL-8 (CXCL8), IP-10 (CXCL10) and MCP-1 (CCL2) and (iii) several other NF-\u03baB target genes, suggesting that CoV infection triggers prototypical innate immune reactions involving the upregulation of inflammatory genes [2\u20134]. Other reports revealed a more diverse and incoherent pattern of host cell gene expression in response to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, respectively [5\u20137]. To date, it remains unclear if these differences are a consequence of different CoV strains/isolates and cell types being used in the respective studies or result (at least in part) from additional confounding factors, such as paracrine effects of cytokines or chemokines secreted during infection. Studies that define (i) the gene sets that are expressed specifically in CoV-infected but not bystander cells and (ii) the signaling pathways triggered in response to viral replication in these infected cells are still lacking [8]. Also, it remains to be studied if changes in host cellular mRNA levels in infected cells result from differential transcription rates of specific genes, altered mRNA stability, or both mechanisms.",

            "text": "Transcriptional gene regulation in response to pathogens involves the activation of a cascade of signal-regulated events that trigger de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II or the release of paused RNA pol II at transcriptional start sites (TSS) [9]. Ongoing transcription requires phosphorylation of RNA pol II at the C-terminal domain (CTD) heptapeptide repeats by CTD kinases. This modification marks the transition from the preinitiation to the initiation complex and is also characteristic for pausing of catalytically active pol II 40\u201360 nucleotides downstream from the TSS [10]. Accordingly, P(S5)-pol II levels are high at the 5\u2019 end of transcribed genes and decrease in a gene-specific manner towards the 3\u2019 end during productive elongation within each cycle of pol II-mediated mRNA synthesis [11]. A potent signal-dependent TF that regulates transcription in innate immunity is NF-\u03baB, a (hetero)dimer composed of the subunits p65, p105/p50 or p100/p52, c-Rel or RelB [12]. These subunits are retained in the cytoplasm by inhibitor of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB) proteins. In the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, phosphorylation by I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) and subsequent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of I\u03baBs liberates p65 subunits. In the non-canonical pathways, p100 or p105 are proteolytically processed to generate free p52 or p50, respectively [13]. Liberated NF-\u03baB subunits then translocate to the nucleus, where their DNA binding and activity is modulated in a cell type- and stimulus-specific manner, a complex process that is mainly controlled by the chromatin accessibility of NF-\u03baB motifs, post-translational modifications and cooperative interaction(s) with other TFs or coregulators such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) [14].",

Within enhancer regions, histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac are strongly associated with combinations of cis-elements that primarily encode binding motifs for lineage-determining TFs, but some enhancers also recruit stimulus-specific inducible TFs [16]. Active enhancers can be distinguished by the presence of regulated histone acetylation at H3K27. Information on possible cooperative activities of TFs in enhancer-dependent gene regulatory networks may be inferred from the motif architecture of the underlying cis-elements [15, 17]. While enhancers are known to represent binding platforms for multiple TFs, the specific relationships between cooperative TF binding, enhancer selection and subsequent patterns of gene regulation in response to external cues including viral infections are still not very well understood [14, 16].",

To detect transcriptional changes caused by viral replication, the cells were either infected at low multiplicity with (replication-competent) HCoV-229E (MOI 0.001) or inoculated with replication-incompetent (heat- or UV-inactivated) HCoV-229E. At 16 and 48 h post infection (p.i.), increasing amounts of HCoV-229E RNA (as assessed by RT-PCR using primer pairs specific for the nsp8 and spike protein coding regions, respectively) were detectable in HCoV-229E-infected cells, but not in control cells inoculated with heat- or UV-inactivated HCoV-229E (S1A Fig). To determine the impact of HCoV-229E infection on the entire host cell transcriptome, we used Agilent microarrays containing 60,000 probes covering annotated genes and non-coding RNAs. Infection with HCoV-229E was found to cause differential expression of 108 genes at 16 h p.i. and 239 genes at 48 h p.i. (Fig 1A, upper panels and S1 Table). A nearly identical set of differentially expressed genes was identified in control cells inoculated with heat-inactivated virus, that is, in the absence of (detectable) viral replication (Fig 1A, lower left and middle panels), suggesting that the observed differential gene expression was caused to a significant extent by soluble factors present in the viral stock or interactions between cells and non-infectious virus particles. However, 2 days after infection we were also able to identify a specific set of 26 upregulated and 11 downregulated genes that were differentially regulated only in cells infected with replication-competent HCoV-229E but not in cells inoculated with inactivated virus (Fig 1A, lower right panel).",

Overrepresentation (ORA) and gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) for the genes identified in the time-course experiment (Fig 1A) and the laser-microdissected samples (Fig 1B and 1C) across all pair-wise comparisons identified the KEGG pathways 04141 (protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum) and 03013 (RNA transport) as the pathways that were most significantly affected by HCoV-229E infection (S2A Fig). Visualization of the mRNA expression values in KEGG 04141 and 03013 pathway maps illustrates that many mRNAs are induced or suppressed at several crucial nodes within these pathways (S2B Fig). The initially identified set of 37 genes regulated by replicating virus only (Fig 1A) contained several strongly upregulated genes of these pathways and included transcription factors (EGR1, DDIT3 (also called CHOP, GADD153 or C/EBPzeta), ATF3, KLF6, ZNF165, BHLHE41, ZBTB43), cytokines and stress signaling proteins (IL6, GADD45A/DDIT1, TNFAIP3/A20), phosphatases (DUSP1), and further factors involved in ER stress (DNAJB9/ERDJ4, NEURL3, HERPUD1, HSPA5/GRP78/BIP) or regulators of translation (PPP1R15A/GADD34, HSPA1A/HSP701A, HSPA1B/HSP701B). Fig 1D summarizes the observed changes in the expression levels of these genes and shows that the differential expression is specific for (and restricted to) infected cell populations. The upregulation of selected genes was confirmed by independent RT-qPCR experiments (Fig 1E). Taken together, these data suggest that HCoV-229E replication regulates complex sets of genes involved in transcription, stress responses, cytokine signaling and nucleotide metabolism.",

            "text": "While A549 cells are a suitable model for studying pathology caused by HCoV-229E in lung epithelial cells, their low infection efficiency with HCoV-229E precluded in-depth molecular analyses requiring very large numbers of infected cells. We, therefore, decided to use HuH7 cells, a widely used human hepatoma cell line that is known to support efficient HCoV-229E replication and infectious particle formation, for subsequent high-resolution analyses at the genome-wide level [18]. As a control, we treated HuH7 cells with IL-1, which allowed us to compare HCoV-229E-linked gene signatures with those of a well characterized cytokine that regulates a broad range of inflammatory genes through stress kinase or NF-\u03baB pathways. HuH7 cells were either infected with HCoV-229E (MOI = 1) or were treated with IL-1 for 1 h and subsequently used for transcriptome analyses. We first asked if the HCoV-229E-linked gene signature observed in A549 cells could also be confirmed in HuH7 cells. We found that 19 out of 26 genes upregulated by HCoV-229E in A549 cells were also upregulated in HuH7 cells, defining a cell type-independent set of virus-induced host cell target genes (Fig 2A). The genes downregulated in A549 cells were not expressed in HuH7 cells (Fig 2A). The kinetic regulation of seven of these genes and their specific induction in cells productively infected with HCoV-229E but not in cells incubated with heat-inactivated virus was validated by RT-qPCR (S3A Fig). IL-1 induced six of these genes (ATF3, DUSP1, TNFAIP3, KLF6, PPP1R15A, and EGR1) indicating that HCoV-229E shares pathways with this cytokine but activates additional specific sets of genes (Fig 2A). At the genome-wide level, HCoV-229E was found to upregulate 1,073 genes and to downregulate 717 genes, whereas IL-1 induced 492 genes and downregulated 95 genes by at least 2-fold on average in repeated microarray studies (Fig 2B, Venn diagrams). The left heatmap in Fig 2B shows all 61 jointly regulated genes which includes well-characterized inflammatory genes (e.g. IL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL6, ICAM1) as well as signaling proteins regulated during inflammatory cell activation (e.g. DUSP1, DUSP8, DUSP10, EGR1, c-JUN, NFKBIA, NFKBIAZ, TNFAIP3, MAP3K8 (TPL-2/COT), ZC3H12A (MCPIP1)). Despite these similarities we observed a substantial number of genes which are upregulated by HCoV-229E, but not by IL-1. The right heatmap in Fig 2B shows the top 50 genes that are specifically upregulated by HCoV-229E. These genes were consistently induced by HCoV-229E in all four individual microarray experiments and were not regulated by heat-inactivated virus (S3B Fig). The differential regulation patterns in response to IL-1 or HCoV-229E were further corroborated by analyzing mRNA expression of representative genes by RT-qPCR (S4A Fig). These data clearly show the major impact of HCoV-229E replication on inflammatory pathways but also reveal much broader virus-induced effects on cellular gene expression. To determine if HCoV-229E-induced genes are enriched for specific biological pathways, the complete microarray data sets were analyzed by GSEA. Fig 2C shows the top ten pathways with significant enrichment of regulated genes and the overall direction of regulation of the entire gene sets. The complete list of expression values and the components for all KEGG pathways of Fig 2C are shown in S3 Table. Fig 2D highlights the similarities and differences of HCoV-229E- versus IL-1-regulated changes in mRNA expression of individual genes in six of these pathways, all of which representing intracellular processes. In four KEGG pathways (04060, 04141, 04630, 04010), HCoV-229E replication mainly caused an upregulation of genes (e.g. CXCL2, HERPUD1, DUSP1, FUT1), while in pathway 00190 the virus infection was mainly associated with a downregulation of genes. In comparison, and consistent with its role as a MAPK pathway-activating cytokine, IL-1 was found to primarily upregulate genes in the pathways 04060 (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction) and 04010 (MAPK signaling pathway). Together, the data shown in Fig 1 and Fig 2 define a core set of genes that are consistently induced by HCoV-229E in both A549 and HuH7 cells. Most of these genes are specifically regulated by HCoV-229E, while another subset of genes is shared with IL-1.",

            "text": "To investigate if and to what extent HCoV-229E affects host cell mRNA expression at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the Ser5 phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (P(S5)-pol II) that accumulates during formation of the transcription initiation complex near the transcriptional start site (TSS) [11]. In order to investigate the recruitment of P(S5)-pol II to the promoter of the HCoV-inducible IL8 gene, we performed ChIP experiments which showed a time-dependent recruitment with a maximum at 24 h p.i. of RNA polymerase II and its phosphorylated form to the promoter/TSS region of the IL8 gene (S4B Fig). This condition was chosen for ChIP-seq experiments using the P(S5)-pol II antibody. The data were then used to assemble averaged profiles of P(S5)-pol II recruitment for groups of up- and downregulated genes that belong to the KEGG pathways and which were affected by HCoV-229E replication and/or IL-1 treatment. Upregulated genes belonging to the cytokine pathway KEGG_04060 showed increased recruitment of P(S5)-pol II by both, HCoV-229E and IL-1, and a prototypical decline of P(S5)-pol II towards the 3\u2019 ends of the genes (Fig 3A). In this group of genes, IL-1-mediated P(S5)-pol II signals were stronger than the CoV-mediated effects (Fig 3A), in line with the stronger induction of mRNA expression of genes such as IL8 or CXCL2 (Fig 2D). Upregulated genes belonging to the ER stress pathway KEGG_04141 showed no regulation by IL-1, but strong upregulation of P(S5)-pol II signals by HCoV-229E (Fig 3A), again correlating with mRNA expression (Fig 2D). For downregulated genes of KEGG pathways 04060 or 04141, we found only low levels of constitutive and unregulated P(S5)-pol II occupancy (Fig 3A). This observation suggests that altered mRNA levels of these genes may be regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms independently from a low level of basal transcription. A meta-gene analysis of P(S5)-pol II recruitment across the entire transcriptome showed a good correlation of P(S5)-pol II recruitment with mRNA expression. For 194 genes shown to be strongly (\u2265 4-fold) upregulated by HCoV-229E and for 59 genes shown to be regulated by both IL-1 and HCoV-229E, an inducible P(S5)-pol II recruitment could be confirmed (Fig 3B). Collectively, these data indicate that HCoV-229E induces a genome-wide transcriptional response to upregulate a broad range of cellular genes.",

            "text": "To examine histone modifications at genomic regions with increased recruitment of RNA polymerase II in HCoV-229E-infected cells, we analyzed the acetylation patterns of H3K9, H3K36 and H4K5. All three modifications are highly enriched at promoters, TSS and gene bodies, where they function to open nucleosomal DNA and additionally provide binding sites for multiple coactivators [19]. Fig 3C shows the histone acetylation pattern for 8 genes whose transcription is specifically induced by HCoV-229E as indicated by the P(S5)-pol II recruitment pattern. At these genes, basal H3K9ac was found to be high and only regulated for two genes (ANKRD1, FICD). At all genes, the basal H3K36ac level was increased by HCoV-229E but not by IL-1. H4K5ac levels were low in uninfected and IL-1 treated cells, but were consistently increased by HCoV-229E. These profiles show that H4K5ac and, for most genes, H3K36ac are characteristic inducible histone marks of HCoV-229E-induced genes. Fig 3D shows examples of read count distribution for eight genes, which are induced by both HCoV-229E and IL-1. These genes show high levels of non-regulated H3K9ac at their promoters and five of them show inducible H3K36ac and H4K5ac (CXCL2, CXCL1, TNFAIP3, EGR1, IL8). As shown in Fig 2B (left heatmap), some genes are stronger induced at the mRNA level by IL-1 (e.g. CXCL2, CXCL1, EGR1, IL8), correlating well with the observed stronger P(S5)-pol II recruitment to these genes. Quantification of read counts confirmed similar inducible changes in histone modifications and P(S5)-pol II recruitment for the upregulated genes in KEGG pathway 04060 and KEGG pathway 04141, but not for the downregulated genes (S4C Fig). Taken together, the data show that HCoV-229E activates specific sets of host cell genes at the transcriptional level by increasing phosphorylation of RNA pol II and acetylation of H3K36 and H4K5 at the promoter and TSS regions.",

            "text": "The gene set that was transcriptionally induced by both HCoV-229E and IL-1 contained several well-characterized NF-\u03baB target genes, such as IL8, CXCL2 and TNFAIP3. This raised the question of whether HCoV-229E elicits non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling or activates the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway, the latter involving I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation [20]. To address this question, cells were infected with HCoV-229E for different periods and signaling events were analyzed by Western blot experiments in comparison to cells that were stimulated for 1 h with IL-1. This cytokine caused strong phosphorylation (mean fold 7.4 +/- 4.6 s.d.) and nearly complete degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (mean fold 0.10 +/- 0.073 s.d.) (Fig 4A and 4B). I\u03baB\u03b1 protein levels were also reduced at 24 h after infection with HCoV-229E but to a significantly lesser extent (mean fold 0.34 +/- 0.12 s.d.) and without a concomitant virus-mediated increase in I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation at this time point (Fig 4A and 4B). A transient early induction of Ser32 phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by HCoV-229E after 3 h of infection was only seen inconsistently in two out of six experiments (Fig 4A and 4B). IL-1 did not affect the expression of the core IKK complex catalytic subunits IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 or of the regulatory subunit NEMO, but the cytokine strongly activated the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 (mean fold 12 +/- 6.3 s.d.) and moderately that of IKK\u03b1 (mean fold 2.1 +/- 0.75 s.d.) (Fig 4A and 4B). In contrast, HCoV-229E infection led to decreased levels of P- IKK\u03b2 (mean fold 0.52 +/- 0.26 s.d.), IKK\u03b2 (mean fold 0.53 +/- 0.13 s.d.) and NEMO (mean fold 0.48 +/- 0.14 s.d.) but remained without effects on P-IKK\u03b1 / IKK\u03b1 (Fig 4A and 4B). Additionally, HCoV-229E was found to induce the expression of TNFAIP3 (A20) (mean fold 1.6 +/- 0.60 s.d.), a potent cytosolic inhibitor of the IKK complex (Fig 4A and 4B) [21].",

            "text": "Another IKK substrate is S536 of p65 NF-\u03baB [22]. This modification was reduced upon HCoV-229E infection (mean fold 0.54 +/- 0.33 s.d.) but triggered by IL-1 (mean fold 3.2 +/- 1.0 s.d.) (Fig 4A and 4B). Together, these data suggest that HCoV-229E replication on the one hand inefficiently triggers NF-\u03baB activity by an unusual mechanism involving partial and selective I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, but on the other hand dampens NF-\u03baB activity by leading to reduced expression of IKK core complex subunits. This negative regulation occurred at the translational level, as the mRNAs encoding the three IKK subunits and I\u03baB\u03b1 were weakly induced by virus (S5A Fig). Besides induction of TNFAIP3, these effects may involve (negative) regulatory steps at the level of translation, as HCoV-229E upregulated the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor subunit eIF2\u03b1 at S51 (mean 2.0 +/- 0.62 s.d.), corroborating data obtained previously for the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Fig 4A and 4B) [23]. Next, we analyzed the amounts of NF-\u03baB subunits in soluble (N1) and chromatin (N2) nuclear fractions in response to HCoV-229E infection or IL-1. Consistent with previously published data, IL-1 strongly increased the concentrations of p50, p52, p65 and c-Rel NF-\u03baB subunits by 5 to 10-fold in the soluble N1 fraction, whereas p65 was the most prominently increased subunit stably associated with the N2 chromatin fraction (Fig 5A and 5B, S6A Fig) [24, 25]. In HCoV-229E-infected cells, a modest 1.5 to 3-fold increase of p65 was observed in the N1 fractions, but also of p50 and p52 which are characteristic for the activation of the non-canonical pathway (Fig 5A and 5B). This experiment also showed that the p65 protein was the only subunit that was detectably increased in the N2 chromatin fraction after virus infection. These small changes were significantly different from basal nuclear levels of NF-\u03baB subunits and were not seen when inactive virus was used (Fig 5A and 5B). We also detected the HCoV-229E N protein in both nuclear compartments, confirming earlier studies on a partial nuclear localization of CoV N proteins (Fig 5A) (reviewed in [26]). Collectively, the data shown in Fig 4, Fig 5A and 5B and S6A Fig demonstrate that HCoV-229E infection causes an attenuated nuclear NF-\u03baB response involving both the non-canonical and canonical NF-\u03baB pathways. To answer the question of whether HCoV-229E selectively regulates nuclear functions of the N2 fraction-associated p65 NF-\u03baB, we analyzed the chromatin recruitment of p65 NF-\u03baB to distinct genomic loci by ChIP-seq experiments, focusing on the promoters of sixteen HCoV-229E- or IL-1-regulated genes for which virus-mediated changes in P(S5)-pol II occupancy and histone acetylation pattern had been identified in the experiments reported above (see Fig 3C and 3D). For genes that were activated by HCoV-229E but not by IL-1, we only observed relatively low and unregulated p65 signals (Fig 5C). In contrast, IL-1 strongly stimulated the recruitment of p65 to 5 of the 8 genomic regions that contained genes shown to be regulated at the mRNA and transcriptional level by both HCoV-229E and IL-1 (see above and Fig 5D) whereas, for HCoV-229E-infected cells, only a moderate increase of p65 binding to the CXCL2, CXCL1, TNFAIP3 and IL8 loci could be detected (Fig 5D). The latter pattern of p65-dependent transcriptional regulation was also seen for the NFKBIA gene which encodes the highly regulated I\u03baB\u03b1 protein (S5A\u2013S5C Fig). The functional relevance of the NF-\u03baB system for the transcriptional regulation of virus-induced (CHAC1, ANKRD1) versus virus- and cytokine-induced genes (IL8, CXCL2) was tested using the IKK\u03b2 inhibitor PHA-408 [27]. This compound partially blocked IL-1- and HCoV-229E-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation in HuH7 cells (Fig 5E), suggesting that IKK activation also contributes to HCoV-229E-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Accordingly, PHA-408 also inhibited the virus-inducible mRNA expression of all 4 genes as well as the upregulation of IL8 and CXCL2 mRNAs by IL-1 (Fig 5F). ChIP-PCR experiments confirmed the virus- versus IL-1-specific p65 and P(S5)-pol II recruitment patterns presented above (Fig 5G). PHA-408 suppressed P(S5)-pol II recruitment to the IL8, CXCL2, CHAC1 and ANKRD1 loci and virus- or IL-1-inducible p65 recruitment to the IL8 and CXCL2 promoters (Fig 5G). The IKK\u03b2 inhibitor also partially suppressed viral replication by about 30% as assessed by measuring N protein levels (Fig 5E). This result is in line with a positive role of IKKs for viral replication that may proceed through substrates unrelated to NF-\u03baB as shown for a few other RNA viruses [20]. However, the inhibitory effects of PHA-408 at the mRNA and chromatin levels were stronger than the suppression of viral protein synthesis, suggesting that the IKK-NF-\u03baB pathway may also exert pro-viral functions (Fig 5E\u20135G). To address the function of NF-\u03baB by a complementary experimental approach, p65 expression was downregulated by RNAi in HeLa cells, which unlike HuH7 cells are suitable for both efficient HCoV-229E infection (shown in S6B and S6C Fig) and transfection of shRNAs. Almost complete reduction of p65 suppressed steady-state protein levels of the p65 target gene I\u03baB\u03b1 but did not affect the IL-1- or virus-mediated I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation or viral N protein synthesis (Fig 6A). Knockdown of p65 suppressed virus- or IL-1-induced mRNA expression as well as P(S5)-pol II and p65 recruitment to the NF-\u03baB target genes IL8 and CXCL2 (Fig 6B and 6C). Moreover, decreased viral titers in these cells suggested that p65 is required for a step subsequent to viral protein synthesis (Fig 6D).",

            "text": "Further evidence for a fundamental role of the IKK-NF-\u03baB system in the HCoV-229E host response was derived from TNFAIP3 knockdown experiments performed under identical conditions. Reduction of TNFAIP3 protein resulted in a 70% inhibition of the infection rate as assessed by N protein levels (Fig 6E). At the same time, basal mRNA expression levels of IL8 and ANKRD1 were strongly increased (Fig 6F). As a result, the fold regulation of these genes by HCoV-229E or IL-1 was almost completely lost (Fig 6F). Basal CXCL2 and CHAC1 levels were less affected by TNFAIP3 knockdown, however, signal-mediated regulation by HCoV-229E or IL-1 was also inhibited (Fig 6F). Collectively, the data shown in Figs 5 and 6 suggest important functional roles for IKK\u03b2, TNFAIP3 and p65 in virus-mediated changes of host cell gene expression and viral replication and reveal that HCoV-229E infection also restricts the maximal activity of the IKK complex. This occurs by inversely balancing the levels of positive regulators of the NF-\u03baB pathway (IKK\u03b2, NEMO) versus negative cytosolic regulators of the IKK complex (TNFAIP3, I\u03baB\u03b1). This fine-tuning allows for some basal NF-\u03baB activity that supports viral replication but limits high nuclear concentration of NF-\u03baB subunits avoiding excessive transcription of inflammatory and other potentially antiviral host cell genes.",

In all instances, we detected significant overlaps between P(S5)-pol II recruitment and histone modifications after virus infection or cytokine treatment (S7 Fig). With respect to p65 NF-\u03baB, 6,977 peaks were detected, of which 353 were regulated by IL-1, 82 were regulated by both IL-1 and HCoV-229E, and 50 by HCoV-229E only (Fig 7A). Quantification of p65 binding revealed much stronger signals for genome regions that were regulated specifically by IL-1 alone or regulated consistently by both IL-1 and HCoV-229E, whereas p65 peaks induced by HCoV-229E but not IL-1 had comparably lower signal intensities (Fig 7B). The majority of constitutive p65 peaks were localized close to promoter-TSS regions, whereas most of the regulated p65 peaks were located at more distant positions (> 20 kb away from the next TSS), suggesting that p65 is involved in occupying distant enhancer structures in these cases (Fig 7C). This conclusion is also supported by an increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in genome regions with increased p65 binding (Fig 7D). An example of such an IL-1- and HCoV-229E-regulated intergenic region, supported by inducible p65 recruitment to p65 DNA motifs combined with histone modifications in the same genomic region, is provided in Fig 7E. Taken together, the data lead us to conclude that, compared to the potent NF-\u03baB activator IL-1, HCoV-229E causes a weak activation of the p65 NF-\u03baB pathway at the chromatin level and regulates recruitment of this transcription factor to a small but specific group of mainly non-coding genomic regions.",

            "text": "These results raised the question of whether HCoV-229E infection leads to a more general activation, possibly affecting the enhancer repertoire across the entire HuH7 genome. To address this possibility, we determined the total number of active enhancers as assessed by the co-ocurrence of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac [28]. We found 36,107 regions carrying both histone marks (Fig 8A, S8A Fig). In total, 2,736 (7.6%) of all enhancers were identified to be regulated by IL-1 and/or HCoV-229E using a 2-fold change in H3K27ac as a threshold level (Fig 8A, sum of Venn diagrams). 1,432 and 1,744 enhancers, respectively, were specifically regulated by either HCoV-229E or IL-1, whereas 440 enhancers (16%) were found to be activated by both stimuli (Fig 8A). Meta-profiling showed that all regulated enhancers had low levels of H3K27ac prior to the activation and responded strongly with a symmetrical broadening of the H3K27ac peak following activation by IL-1 or HCoV-229E (Fig 8B). Compared to IL-1-specific enhancers, the HCoV-229E-specific enhancers were found to cover smaller regions of the genomic DNA, suggesting that these regions are occupied by a smaller number of DNA-binding factors and cofactors (Fig 8B). Quantitative assessment of histone modifications corroborated the specific increases of H3K27ac for all three groups of enhancers and little regulation of H3K4me1 (Fig 8C). It should be noted that all enhancer regions also showed additional regulation of H3K36ac, H4K5ac and H3K9ac. As these lysines are modified by different HATs such as CBP/p300 or GCN5 [29\u201331], this observation suggests that different HAT enzymes are recruited to and modify these structures (Fig 8C). Fig 8D provides 3 examples for each of the different enhancer groups. Notably, there was no virus-regulated p65 binding to the 992 HCoV-229E-specific or any of the IL-1-specific enhancers, suggesting that the vast majority of HCoV-229E enhancers is controlled by transcription factor combinations that differ from those employed by IL-1-regulated enhancers which always showed inducible p65 recruitment (Fig 8C and 8D). In line with this hypothesis, de novo motif searches revealed a complex assembly of cis-elements that were characteristic for each of the 3 regulated groups of enhancers (Fig 8E). These structures matched to a large number of known transcription factor-binding sites (Fig 8E). While the HCoV-229E-specific enhancers are predicted to bind various combinations of AP-1 subunits (Jun, JunD, FOSL2, ATF4) and C/EBPs, the IL-1 regulated enhancers are enriched for NF-\u03baB and alternative combinations of AP-1 sites (Fig 8E). Additionally, a variety of other TFs, such as FOXC2, FOXL1, FOXB1, DDIT3 and others, can bind to these sites in different combinations (Fig 8E). Thus, the three groups of enhancers provide composite binding sites for stimulus-specific combinations of TFs. Accordingly, GO classifications of all annotated genes next to the HCoV-229E-specific enhancers revealed an enrichment for catabolic and ER stress pathways, whereas genes next to enhancers regulated by both IL-1 and HCoV-229E or by IL-1 alone are highly enriched for multiple immunoregulatory pathways (S8B Fig). ChIP-PCR experiments using PHA-408 confirmed that the two enhancers on Chr.1 and on Chr.10 shown in Fig 8D differ in their virus- or IL-1-mediated p65 recruitment and sensitivity to IKK\u03b2 inhibition (S9 Fig). In conclusion, these data reveal that HCoV-229E infection activates specific histone modification patterns in a large number of genomic regions that are likely to orchestrate the genome wide gene response to this virus. Apart from a number of shared enhancer regions, this pattern is fundamentally different from the prototypical NF-\u03baB p65-driven IL-1 enhancer structures and provides an explanation for the large divergent sets of virus-specific genes (summarized in Fig 9A).",

            "text": "Emerging or re-emerging RNA viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans and animals [1, 32, 33]. With few exceptions, these RNA viruses complete their viral life cycle in the cytoplasm but need to reprogram and/or adjust specific biosynthetic and other pathways required for viral replication and production of infectious virus progeny according to their specific requirements [34, 35]. Simultaneously, intrinsic host cell defense systems are activated and, in many cases, counteracted by a multitude of strategies that viruses developed during viral evolution [32]. Despite significant scientific progress in the past few years, the complete spectrum of interactions between plus-strand RNA viruses and their hosts is far from being understood, in particular if it comes to understanding complex regulatory networks at a genome-wide level [8, 36]. Here, we provide a high-resolution view of both transcriptome and chromatin changes in cells infected with the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E, a virus that causes mild upper respiratory tract disease and is efficiently transmitted in the human population, indicating excellent adaption to its human host. The sophisticated fine-tuning of IKK-NF-\u03baB activity and the identification of thousands of coronavirus-specific enhancers reported in this study provides important insight into the enormous complexity by which an RNA virus resets the host cell chromatin response to change expression levels of many hundreds of host cell genes and, at the same time, stimulates future studies into the molecular interplay between corona- and other RNA viruses and their hosts.",

            "text": "There is conflicting evidence regarding the activation or importance of the NF-\u03baB pathway for human CoV [4, 37\u201340]. In our view, this may be attributed to the methods used to study NF-\u03baB activation or the ectopic expression of viral proteins rather than infection with intact virus but may also be linked to biological differences between CoV that belong to different virus species/genera and are known to infect different hosts. Here, we provide the first in-depth and high-resolution analysis of endogenous NF-\u03baB activation and p65 DNA binding in virus-infected cells. In addition, we compared the HCoV-229E-triggered responses directly to those elicited by IL-1, a potent inducer of the classical NF-\u03baB pathway. Our data suggest two different consequences of HCoV-229E infection for NF-\u03baB activity: On the one hand the viral infection leads to NF-\u03baB activation, as seen by I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, p65 chromatin recruitment and the inducible transcription of NF-\u03baB target genes. This elevated NF-\u03baB activity has a pro-viral function, as evidenced by impaired virus replication after IKK inhibition or p65 knockdown. Mechanistically, elevated NF-\u03baB activity also allows for synthesis of the A20 protein which is required for efficient virus replication. These findings are in line with the recent observation that deletion of the A20-encoding gene protects mice from influenza A virus infection [41, 42]. On the other hand, we also observed that HCoV-229E has acquired specific mechanisms to dampen NF-\u03baB activity, as evidenced by lower levels of p65 chromatin recruitment and comparably low induction of gene expression. HCoV-229E infection failed to induce IKK phosphorylation and only caused insufficient phosphorylation and incomplete degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1. In addition, the steady state levels of NEMO and IKK\u03b2 decreased during infection which could be due to several mechanisms including phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 to shut off protein de novo synthesis [43, 44]. The simultaneous induction and restriction of the NF-\u03baB response is typically seen for many different RNA viruses [20]. This mechanism is visualized in Fig 9B and presumably serves to ensure a corridor of elevated NF-\u03baB activity allowing to support viral replication, while also preventing full activity of the transcription factor that counteracts virus infection by enabling the synthesis of anti-viral mediators such as IFN or other cytokines. This could also explain the pro-viral function of A20, as it prevents exaggerated anti-viral gene expression and NF-\u03baB activity.",

To our knowledge, none of these earlier studies addressed the question of whether the observed changes of host cell gene expression were caused by the replicating virus itself or (partly or largely) by factors potentially present in the virus preparation used to infect/inoculate the cells to be used for subsequent analyses. Using appropriate controls and two different human cell lines, we were able to identify a common set of genes that is specifically induced in productively infected cells with ongoing HCoV-229E genome replication and expression. This gene set contains factors involved in the ER stress response, consistent with an earlier study showing that some genes from this group (PERK, ATF3/4, ERO1\u03b1) are induced at the protein level in IBV-infected avian cells [23, 45, 46]. Our mRNA expression and bioinformatics analysis identified a large number of additional genes of the ER stress response that are induced by HCoV-229E, such as CHAC1, an enzyme that degrades glutathione [47, 48] and others (FICD, HERPUD1, DNAJB9/ERDJ4) functioning as regulators of AMPylation, ubiquitylation or co-chaperones, respectively [49\u201351]. Moreover, HCoV-229E was found to upregulate transcription factors (TFs) with known functions such as EGR1 and c-JUN, but also poorly characterized TFs such as zinc finger (ZNF)165, basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors (BHLHE40/41) or zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 43 (ZBTB43) [52, 53].",

This small group of genes mainly involves factors involved in innate immune regulation or cytokine functions (e.g. CXCL2, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL8, GDF15) or MAPK pathway signaling (e.g. DUSP1, 8, 10, 16, c-JUN, JUN D), and helps explain the inflammatory phenotype that, in many cases, is associated with coronavirus infections.

In line with this idea, ANKRD1 was recently described to suppress NF-\u03baB activity, whereas viral N proteins have consistently been reported to translocate to the nucleus, although to date there is no evidence for an involvement of the N protein in chromatin processes [26, 54, 55].",

            "text": "Additional support for HCoV-229E-specific TF complexes comes from experiments conducted to characterize the enhancer repertoire of virus-infected cells. A striking finding of our study is the identification of more than 1,000 enhancers that are activated specifically by HCoV-229E. The lack of p65 recruitment and the discovery of specifically enriched motifs for specific groups of TFs distinguish these structures from the IL-1-regulated enhancers. These motifs contain binding sites for a number of AP-1 proteins (FOSL2, JUND, c-JUN) that are downstream of the ERK or JNK pathways known to be triggered by SARS-CoV or IBV infection [23, 56]. Another abundantly found motif is bound by various members of the forkhead superfamily of TFs (FOXC1/2, FOXL1, FOXB1). These multifunctional proteins regulate transcriptional programs in cancer and innate immunity but their roles in RNA virus infection are unknown and await further investigation [57, 58]. Additionally, the motif TGATGXAA is found in 108 virus-specific enhancers (Fig 8E). This sequence matches the consensus sequence for the C/EBP-ATP response element CARE (TGATGXAAX) [59]. The CARE element is crucial for the ATF4-dependent activation of a specific set of genes that are (up)regulated during amino acid starvation [60]. ATF4 and its heterodimerization partners of the C/EBP or JUN families of TFs control metabolic gene expression programs but also the initiation of cell death upon activation of PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 during the ER stress response [61\u201363]. Thus, the large enhancer repertoire identified in this study likely coordinates a global gene response to cope with increased translational demand and the elevated load of misfolded proteins in the ER during viral replication. Altogether, the identification in non-coding genomic regions of three types of enhancers that respond to virus, to IL-1, or to both against a background of 90% of all the other enhancer regions that did not change in response to these stimuli, provides an impressive example of the versatile usage of a small portion of the enhancer repertoire of a human cell to trigger stimulus-specific gene expression [14\u201316].",
