As such, the industrially relevant fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is not only a well-known producer of the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic penicillin, but also secretes small, cysteine-rich and cationic proteins with antimicrobial activity. P. chrysogenum is an ideal producer of bio-products with beneficial potential to mankind as it is fermentable and bulk production is easy and cheap2.

We adapted the recently described P. chrysogenum-based expression system20 to generate sufficient amounts of PAFB for functional and structural characterization. The use of the paf-deficient P. chrysogenum Q176 strain (\u2206paf) as recipient ensured optimal high yield PAFB production by avoiding co-expression of the related antifungal protein PAF. We identified a disulphide-bond stabilized and compact \u03b2-folded structure of PAFB and found - apart from a growth inhibitory activity against moulds and yeasts - anti-viral activity, which has never been reported before for any member of the small, cationic and cysteine-rich protein group from ascomycetes.",

The same was true for the P. chrysogenum strain \u2206paf that lacks the PAF-encoding gene21. We examined this mutant to increase the chance to identify PAFB in the absence of PAF (data not shown). Therefore, we performed Northern blot analyses to determine the abundance and timing of pafB transcription. Surprisingly, we found that pafB mRNA was detectable in P. chrysogenum Q176 shaking cultures with an expression maximum at 48 h after inoculation and a subsequent decrease in transcript amount upon further incubation time (Fig. 1a).",

According to the ESI-MS data, three isoforms of unlabelled PAFB were present in solution. MS peak intensities (Fig. 3) and NMR of 15N-labelled PAFB suggested that the full-length PAFB sequence (58 residues) is the dominant form in the mixture. NMR spectra and MS analysis of the 15N/13C-labelled PAFB, however, identified only the shortest sequence (56 aa) (Supplementary Fig. S4). We named this short PAFB variant \u201cshort-form PAFB\u201d (sfPAFB) and all aa sequence numbering below refers to this variant. Based on triple resonance NMR spectra, all amide HN and NH atoms could be found and assigned in the 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of sfPAFB (Supplementary Fig. S5) except for Lys1 because the first N-terminal residue of proteins cannot be detected in the 15N-HSQC spectrum. Gly18, which resides in the middle of the big flexible loop 3, adjacent to Gly19 (Fig. 4), did not show a visible amide NH signal. However, other signals belonging to Gly18 were unambiguously assigned (CA and HA2, HA3). We note that for the 15N-labelled sample, the missing Lys1 NH signals could be found. The two overlaid 15N-HSQC spectra of the short (15N/13C-labelled) and full-length (15N-labelled) forms of PAFB exhibited good agreement for most of the peaks (Supplementary Fig. S5). As our structure calculations were based on measurements of the 15N/13C form, we decided to solve the structure of sfPAFB. As discussed below in more detail, there is no indication that the structures of PAFB and sfPAFB would exhibit differences except for the N-terminus.",

They are located between residues Gly4 and Cys6, Thr12 and Leu16, Asn21 and Asn25, His40 and Asp44 as well as Arg49 and Asp51, respectively. The strands are connected by three small loops (1, 2, 4) and one large loop (3) comprising \u03b2-turn motives (Fig. 4). Finally, the two \u03b2-pleated sheets have the following \u03b2-strand pattern: \u03b21-\u03b22-\u03b23 and \u03b21-\u03b24-\u03b25, respectively. There are six highly conserved cysteines in the amino acid sequence of sfPAFB in the form of three disulphide bonds between the cysteines 6 and 34, 13 and 41 as well as 26 and 52. Note that this pattern (abcabc) creates a hidden central core region. While loops 1 and 4 form turn conformations, the secondary structure analysis showed the presence of a bend in the flexible glycine-glycine motives containing loop 2. The second and third \u03b2-strands are relatively hydrophobic compared to the other parts of the protein having no charged residues. In contrast, the central part of loop 3, the so-called large loop, contains three (32, 33 and 35) conserved lysine residues, which, together with Lys9, form a positively charged surface region. In general, the large loop adopts a bent conformation, but at its C-terminal end (Asp37-Arg38) a \u03b2-turn structure is formed. The side-chain of Asp37 is close to those of Arg38 and Lys9, respectively. Interestingly, strand \u03b24 in the middle of the second \u03b2-sheet exhibits high negative charge density. Nevertheless, there are several basic amino acids in its vicinity that potentially also form salt-bridges. Although both strands, \u03b21 and \u03b25, are relatively short, several H-bonds can be found between them and strand \u03b24, stabilizing the second \u03b2-sheet. The side-chains of Tyr43 and Tyr15 interact with each other, and together with other apolar amino acids they form a hydrophobic core in sfPAFB. Finally, after the fifth, amphipathic \u03b2-strand, the C-terminal region of sfPAFB does not adopt any particular regular secondary structure.",

            "text": "Despite the relatively low sequence similarity (35.2%), the structure of sfPAFB is highly similar to that of PAF determined previously (Protein Data Bank ID: 2MHV). Both proteins adopt a Greek key super-secondary structure and \u03b2-barrel global fold with identical disulphide bond pattern (abcabc). In order to compare their local conformation, the structures of the two proteins were superimposed. Their RMSD values were below 0.5 \u00c5 overall and 0.2 \u00c5 in the \u03b2-strands (Fig. 4) except for the N-terminus. However, it turned out that the conformation of loop 3 also shows substantial differences between PAF and sfPAFB. This was unexpected because the second half of loop 3 is one of the most highly conserved regions in these proteins with the longest patch of conserved residues (asparagine-lysine-lysine-cysteine) located here (Fig. 4), whereas the \u03b2-strands generally show a lower level of sequence conservation. While both of the proteins adopt a bent structure in this region, in PAF it resulted in a turn-like conformation both at residues Asp32-Asn33 and Asp39-Asn40 amino acids, respectively. In contrast, only the latter turn is present in sfPAFB at positions Asp37-Arg38. It should also be noted that although the high density of positive surface charges is believed to be a major contributor to the activity of PAF8, only four lysine residues are conserved between PAF and PAFB. Furthermore, PAFB lacks a \u2018belt\u2019 of structurally aligned lysine residues (Lys 6, 15, 42 in PAF) and has generally lower overall positive surface charge and a different surface electrostatic potential (Fig. 4). To assess the possible differences between sfPAFB and the full-length protein, we built a first-approximation structural model of full-length PAFB by adding a leucine-serine segment to the N-terminus of the experimental sfPAFB structure. Short molecular dynamics (MD) runs suggest that the full-length N-terminus might align to strand \u03b24 (residues 41\u201345) to form an N-terminal \u03b2-strand longer than in the sfPAFB form similar to the case of PAF (Supplementary Fig. S6). This is also plausible based on the favourable interaction between Lys1 and Asp42 (sfPAFB numbering) formed during the MD calculations. Nevertheless, we do not expect that the structures of sfPAFB and full-length PAFB exhibit substantial differences. Finally, the variation of the N-terminus does not dramatically change the biophysical features of the PAFB forms, such as isoelectric point (pI), net charge and the grand average of hydropathy (GRAVY) (Supplementary Table S1).",

(2017) reported about the efficacy of host defense peptides from the skin of the South Indian frog to treat respiratory viral infections, as in the case of human influenza A viruses28. In this study, we examined the selective anti-viral potential of PAFB and PAF to reduce the infection of human epithelial cell line L132 by the human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV 229E) in vitro. First, we confirmed that PAFB, similarly to PAF, showed no cytotoxic effects on the host cells in the applied concentration range (0\u201332 \u03bcM) (Supplementary Fig. S7). The anti-viral activity of the proteins was expressed in terms of protein concentration that protects against virus-induced cytopathogenic effects (CPE) in L132 cells, such as syncytia formation, vacuolization, cell rounding, detachment and cell death (Fig. 9a). We determined 8 \u03bcM as the minimum effective protein concentration that reduced virus-induced CPE and preserved cell monolayer integrity (Fig. 9a,b). The anti-viral efficiency could be observed in virus infected L132 cells at different viral titres (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1\u20130.01) (Supplementary Fig. S8), but reached a maximum inhibition value of 21.07% with PAFB against HCoV 229E at MOI 0.01 (Fig. 9b). PAF in contrast, inhibited HCoV 229E-induced CPE less effectively than PAFB, while still exhibiting antiviral activity, especially at lower viral titers: 8 \u03bcM PAF reduced the viral CPE to 11.89% at MOI 0.01 (Fig. 9a,b). The application of higher protein concentrations (16 \u03bcM and 32 \u03bcM), however, did not further increase the anti-viral effect of PAFB and PAF (Supplementary Fig. S8). The anti-viral efficacy of both proteins was also confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments, where 8 \u03bcM PAFB and PAF successfully reduced the number of HCoV 229E infected L132 cells (Fig. 9c). HCoV 229E localization was examined with a virus-specific antibody at 72 h post infection when viral replication and transcription was underway. As shown in Fig. 9c, a strong virus-specific green fluorescent signal was observed in the majority of HCoV 229E infected cells (MOI 0.01) without PAFB or PAF treatment. The signal intensity and the number of virus infected cells significantly decreased in the presence of PAFB or PAF (Fig. 9c). This observation suggests that the antiviral effect of the proteins may reduce not only the final stages of the viral replication cycle and CPE, but also the earlier steps of the infection and/or the spread of the viral particles.",

            "text": "In this study, we provide detailed insight into the antimicrobial activity and the structure of the secreted PAFB protein from the penicillin-producing mould P. chrysogenum Q176. This protein belongs to the group of small, cysteine-rich and cationic proteins from ascomycetes. Although the PAFB encoding gene was abundantly transcribed, we could not detect the translated gene product under the cultivation conditions applied. This phenomenon is not unique. Only recently, Garrigues et al. (2016) reported that the identification of the genome encoded antifungal protein AfpB from Penicillium digitatum had failed, although the gene was transcribed at high level18. Instead the antifungal activity of this cryptic protein was successfully analysed by mapping the antifungal motifs of AfpB with synthetic cysteine-containing peptides29 before recombinant, full-length AfpB was generated recently for functional analysis applying the P. chrysogenum-based expression system20,30. The reason remains obscure, why the timely expressed and correctly processed pafB mRNA was not translated into detectable protein amounts by P. chrysogenum Q176. As conidia of P. chrysogenum were PAFB susceptible, it seems that the production of PAFB needs strict regulation to avoid self-limitation. On the other hand, the pre-existing pool of mRNA may serve as a reservoir allowing for fast availability in case of urgent needs, e.g. a fast response to changing environmental or developmental stimuli. Indeed, a function of cysteine-rich, cationic proteins beyond fungal growth inhibition, such as stress response and asexual development, supporting the fitness of the producing moulds has been reported earlier21,31. A recently published transcriptome meta-analysis for the expression regulation of the Aspergillus niger antifungal protein AnAFP further underlines the role of these proteins in stress response, growth and development, nutrient recycling, and autophagy32. Thus, the pafB mRNA may be stored, for example in processing bodies or stress granules as described for S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, until the PAFB protein is needed33\u201335. We are currently investigating this assumption.",

Another member of this protein group, the Aspergillus giganteus AFP, is secreted in two naturally occurring N-terminal variants, the major short form (51 aa) and in lower amounts the larger form (lf-AFP), containing six additional N-terminal amino acids37. Lf-AFP remarkably differs from AFP in pI, GRAVY and net charge and shows lower antifungal activity37,38. To date, we cannot tell whether the N-terminal PAFB variants occur naturally, e.g. by autocatalytic activities, or whether they are a consequence of overexpression conditions. The latter has been observed for example, for the expression of the recombinant bovine chymosin in Aspergillus awamori, which resulted in products with variable N-termini, most likely due to proteolysis in the culture supernatant39. Recombinant PAF produced in high yields in P. chrysogenum showed no N-terminal variations whereas subtle N-terminal differences were detected when expressed in P. digitatum20. Similarly, AfpB expression in P. digitatum using the paf-derived expression cassette resulted in gene products with N-terminal variations30. In none of these cases, however, the antifungal activity of the N-terminal variants was affected20,30. Proteolysis of the PAFB N-terminus might be influenced by the nutrient composition of the fermentation broth. For double isotope labelling (15N/13C) of PAFB, sucrose was replaced with 13C-glucose as carbon source in the growth medium, which might be responsible for the generation of sfPAFB (56 aa). This assumption requires further analysis in the future. In one of our recent studies, we demonstrated that the N-terminal aa regulate the stability, folding and antifungal function of the recombinant NFAP protein from Neosartorya fischeri40. By contrast, we found here, that the N-terminal PAFB variants do not differ significantly in their overall solution structure and physico-chemical features. We therefore assume that the antifungal activity is not affected.",

PAFB prevented more effectively than PAF the germination and colony establishment of N. crassa, and significant differences in the susceptibility of some tested fungi, e.g. A. terreus, P. chrysogenum, point towards different modes of action of these two proteins. Variations in the antifungal spectrum and the mode of action were reported for the structurally very similar, related antifungal proteins PAF, AfpB, NFAP and AFP26,30,44,45. We propose that the presence and activity of host interaction molecules that regulate the uptake mechanism, the processing of signals and the ability to cope with detrimental effects triggered by the antifungal proteins determine the susceptibility of fungal species. Furthermore, the importance of protein surface charges and their distributions described for PAF function need to be considered to explain differences in the antifungal activity8.",

Interestingly, the overproduction of recombinant PAFB did not affect the proliferation of the producer strain P. chrysogenum pafB, although an inhibitory activity was observed on conidia in the microdilution assays (Table 1). One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that under PAFB expression conditions (established hyphal growth and MM), P. chrysogenum hyphae lack any PAFB susceptibility determinants, which, in contrast, must be present in 0.1 \u00d7 PDB. Indeed, we proved that PAFB, similarly to PAF, did not interact with P. chrysogenum hyphae cultivated in MM (Supplementary Fig. S9). Only when grown in 0.1 \u00d7 PDB, hyphal proliferation was inhibited and PAFB was taken up by the cells (Supplementary Fig. S9). PAF, on the other hand, neither interacted with P. chrysogenum conidia nor hyphae, irrespective of the culture medium applied (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S9).",

Apparently, yeast cells exhibit susceptibility determinants for both proteins when cultivated in this \u201cstarvation\u201d medium. The time course experiments indicated that C. albicans cells were not killed immediately after administration of PAFB and PAF, but that cell death occurred in a time and concentration dependent manner, supporting our observations made so far that exclude a fast killing mechanism, e.g. by pore formation, but point towards more complex interaction mechanisms with the target cell8,27.",

A surprising and novel observation for small, cysteine-rich, cationic and antimicrobial proteins of fungal origin was the efficacy of PAFB and PAF against HCoV 229E virus. This virus is highly contagious and can cause mild, cold-like respiratory illness. However, highly pathogenic HCoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) predominantly infect lower airways and cause fatal pneumonia with high morbidity and mortality during an epidemic53. Anti-HCoV drugs and vaccines are in different stages of development, but they are still lacking today54. PAFB and PAF, preferentially at low MOI, reduced the virus-induced CPE of infected human L132 cells, thus promising a potential alternative therapeutic approach against human coronaviruses. Based on the data collected in this study, we suggest that PAFB and PAF directly - or indirectly by influencing the host cell metabolism - inhibit the release and spread of progeny virus particles, or destroy the HCoV virions. The observed slight differences in the anti-viral activity between PAFB and PAF may result from different virus or host cell susceptibility towards both proteins, or from differences in the protein surface charge distributions as outlined above. The observation that anti-viral efficacy could not be further increased with higher protein concentrations than 8 \u00b5M could be attributed to low bioavailability of the proteins at higher concentrations, a partial clustering or hampered crossing of bio-membranes as shown for antimicrobial proteins in previous studies55,56. Work is currently in progress to get detailed insight into the mode of the anti-viral action of PAFB and PAF.",

            "text": "Three PAFB samples were prepared for NMR studies: an unlabelled, a 15N-labelled and a 15N/13C-labelled as described recently20. Lyophilized protein was dissolved in 20 mM acetate buffer (prepared with deuterated acetic acid, pH = 4.5) and filled into Shigemi NMR sample tube (250 \u00b5l). Protein concentration was set to 1.5 mM. Protein resonance assignment was accomplished with the same strategy that was applied previously for double-labelled PAF6. Briefly, 2D 15N-HSQC served as the root for the following 3D triple resonance experiments: HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, HNHA, HBHA(CO)NH and HN(CO)CACB, which were used for obtaining backbone signal assignments59. For resonance assignment of side chains the combination of HC(C)H COSY, HC(C)H TOCSY, HCC(CO)NH and (H)CCH-TOCSY experiments were used, and aromatic protons were identified with the aid of 2D CB(CGCD)HD and CB(CGCDCE)HE spectra. The applied experiment versions were identical with those described in our previous study6. To collect NOE distance restraints, 15N- and 13C-resolved 3D NOESY spectra were recorded as well as a 2D 1H-1H NOESY this latter experiment was performed on the unlabelled PAFB sample. All the above listed measurements were recorded on a Bruker Avance II 500 spectrometer equipped with TXI z-gradient probe-head. The NOESY-type experiments were repeated on a 700 MHz spectrometer with similar configuration. The higher spectral resolution of the NOESY spectra with less overlapping cross-peaks help obtaining more distant restraints for structure calculation. All spectra were acquired at 298 K and data was processed with Topspin 3.0 software. Sequential resonance assignment was performed with the aid of CARA 1.8.4 software from which chemical shift data was exported to other software. Cyana 2.1 torsion angle dynamics package60,61 was used for de novo structure determination in combination with the ATNOS-CANDID algorithm (the latter was used for peak picking and NOE assignment). Setup files for Cyana were prepared manually. Disulphide connections were defined in the Cyana input assuming abcabc disulphide pattern as in PAF (linking cysteine 8\u201336, 15\u201343 and 28\u201354). Diastereotopic protons for non-equivalent CH2 groups were considered as stereo-chemically ambiguous assignments. Backbone torsional angle constraints were predicted according to TALOS+62 and were used for the refinement of the structure model. Seven cycles of Cyana iterations were performed, and the 20 lowest energy conformers were considered as a final structure model. Chemical shift data and NMR experimental parameters were submitted to the BMRB databank and the structural ensemble was uploaded to Protein Data Bank (ID: 2NC2).",
