Based on their life cycles, phages can be classified as virulent and temperate phages. Upon infection, the virulent phages take over the machinery of the host cell to produce and finally lyse the host cell to release their progenies. In addition to the lytic cycle, temperate phages also have a lysogenic cycle, in which phages incorporate their genomes into a host chromosome (or maintain their genome extrachromosomally) and replicate with it without lysing their host cells (Howard-Varona et al., 2017). Therefore, temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria and play important roles in virulence of bacterial pathogens (Boyd, 2012; Cuenca Mdel et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Many studies have indicated that the infection of temperate phages might lead to the enhancement of host virulence as many virulent genes of pathogenic bacteria were identified in the phage genome (Boyd, 2012). For instance, lambdoid phages encode both subunits, Stx1 and Stx2, of Shiga toxins, which are the major virulent factor of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (Herold et al., 2004). Many effector proteins, which are bacterial virulent factors and are injected into host cells by bacterial type III secretion system to help bacterial invasion and survival, were identified in Salmonella typhimurium phages (Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2001). Infection with such temperate phages might lead to the transmission of the virulent genes, thus increases the virulence of host bacteria (Cuenca Mdel et al., 2016). Additionally, it was reported that temperate staphylococcal phage 80\u03b1 could efficiently encapsidate and transfer bacterial pathogenicity island, SaPI1, to a recipient strain (Ruzin et al., 2001). In contrast to the enhancement of virulence, however, the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence are largely unknown.",

Meanwhile, it was reported that B. bronchiseptica can cause severe pulmonary infections in immunosuppressed patients, such as people with lymphoproliferative disorders (Stoll et al., 1981), HIV infection (Rampelotto et al., 2016), cystic fibrosis (Register et al., 2012), and lung transplantation patients (Ner et al., 2003). In addition, B. bronchiseptica infection causes atrophic rhinitis and bronchopneumonia in pigs, leading to a huge loss to the pig industry (Brockmeier, 2004; Brockmeier et al., 2008). Recently, drug-resistant B. bronchiseptica strains were frequently reported, which brings an urgency of developing new strategies to treat or prevent the infection (Kadlec et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2011; Pruller et al., 2015a). Phage therapy could be an alternative strategy against drug-resistant B. bronchiseptica infection. In fact, several B. bronchiseptica phages have been isolated (Liu et al., 2004; Petrovic et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019a), and some of those were tested against B. bronchiseptica infection in our previous study (Chen et al., 2019a).",

An interesting temperate phage, PHB09, which has a specific integration site in the host genome, was found from our B. bronchiseptica phage collections. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PHB09 integration on its host. Interestingly, we found that the specific integration of PHB09 significant decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in mice. Furthermore, mice intranasally inoculated with 1.8 \u00d7 108 colony-forming unit (CFU) lysogenic strain were completely protected when challenged with 3.0 \u00d7 108 CFU B. bronchiseptica Bb01, indicating the vaccine potential of the lysogenic strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report that the integration of temperate phage reduces the virulence of host bacteria in the mammal, indicating the complicated roles of temperate phages in bacterial virulence other than the simple delivery of virulent genes. Our study also provides a new strategy to design avirulent strains for developing bacterial vaccines.",

Five milliliters of each filtrate was added to 10 ml of exponential-phase B. bronchiseptica Bb01 culture, respectively. After 12 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cultures were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min, and 300 \u03bcl supernatant of each sample was mixed with 500 \u03bcl of B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in the 15-ml tube. After adding 6 ml of molten soft TSA (0.75% agar) supplemented with 10% sterile defibrinated sheep blood, the mixtures were poured into prepared TSA plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnights. The single plaques were picked up individually and inoculated into 5 ml of log-phase B. bronchiseptica Bb01 culture. After 12 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cultures were filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm membranes to remove bacterial cells. The filtrate containing phages was titrated, and the phages were subject one more round of purification. For electron microscopy analysis, phages were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (Thomas et al., 2007; Tao et al., 2016, 2017). Phages were placed on carbon-coated grids, washed gently with a few drops of distilled water, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate.

Protein BLAST (BLASTP) was used to identify proteins sharing similarities with the predicted phage proteins. The tRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Chan, 2016; Chan and Lowe, 2019). Promoters and terminators were analyzed using the BPROM (Solovyev and Salamov, 2011).

The initial characterization of morphology by transmission electron microscopy showed that phage PHB09 had an isometric polyhedral head and a long flexible tail (Data not shown). Based on the morphology and genome sequence, the phage PHB09 was assigned to the family Siphoviridae, according to the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses classification system. The phage PHB09 genome was sequenced, and the large terminase subunit (ORF31) was used to generate phylogenetic trees, which also indicated that PHB09 is a new member of the family Siphoviridae (Figure 1). The phage PHB09 has a dsDNA genome consisting of 42,129-bp with a G+C content of 62.8% (Accession No. MN103401). The genome encodes one tRNA (Met-CAT) and 59 putative ORFs, of which 25 proteins have assigned functions and 34 are unique as no homologous proteins were identified (Figure 2A and Table S1). The entire genome contains four functional modules, structure/assembly module, replication module, transcription regulators, and lysis/lysogeny module. Genes in the structure and assembly module include small and large terminase subunit, portal protein, major capsid, and tail proteins (Figure 2A). The replication module contains homologs to known proteins, such as HNH homing endonuclease and methyltransferase. An integrase gene int, which shows 40% identity to the integrase of Pseudomonas phage phiAH14a, was found in the lysogeny module (Figure 2A and Table S1). In addition, the lysogeny related gene, cI, was also identified. No antibiotic resistance genes were found in phage the PHB09 genome when analyzed with ResFinder, a web-service used to examine the phage genome for antibiotic resistance genes (Kleinheinz et al., 2014). This is also supported by a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay of 14 antibiotics against lysogenized B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01+ (Table S2).",

Thirty strains were insensitive to PHB09 infection, of which 13 strains were found containing a PHB09 prophage as described below.

            "text": "During analyzing the host range of phage PHB09, we identified 30 strains of B. bronchiseptica that were insensitive to phage infection. Since PHB09 is a temperate phage based on genome data (Figure 2A and Table S1), it is possible that these B. bronchiseptica strains might contain prophage PHB09, making them resistant against phage PHB09 infection. We, therefore, designed three sets of phage-specific primers (Table S3, Primers 1F/1R, 2F/2R, and 3F/3R) to screen the phage-insensitive strains for the presence of prophage PHB09 using PCR. We found that 13 of 30 strains contain prophage PHB09. This was further confirmed by second-generation sequencing of 3 randomly selected B. bronchiseptica strains. Interestingly, we found all the three sequenced genomes had a unique integration site of phage PHB09, which is a 14-bp sequence (TGACCGAGTACATC) (Figures 2B,C). To know whether the integration site of prophage PHB09 is unique in B. bronchiseptica genome, two sets of primers, 4F/4R and 5F/5R, were synthesized and used to screen all 13 lysogenized strains (Figures 2C,D and Table S3). If the lysogenized strains contain the same integration site, the primer sets will yield amplicons of 1,030 and 1,314-bp, respectively. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR products showed that expected amplicons were amplified from all strains, indicating the integration site of prophage PHB09 is unique (Figures 2C,D). To exclude the possibility that phage PHB09 containing more than one integration site, we isolated the genome of all 13 strains and sequenced them with the primers, 5F and 4R, which match the ends of phage PHB09 (Figure 2C and Table S3). The sequencing results were consistent with PCR analysis, which further supported the finding that the integration site of prophage PHB09 is unique.",

The surrounding alveolar cavity was filled with necrotic tissue cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and blue-stained bacterial colonies. Most of the alveolar walls of the necrotic foci were hyperemia thickened, and the alveolar cavity was filled with serous exudate (Figure 4B, low panel).

The infection of lytic phages will finally lead to the burst of host cells to release progeny phages. Undoubtedly, bacteria can evolve resistance to phage infections through de novo mutation for survival, which might lead to the changes in bacterial traits (Buckling and Rainey, 2002). Due to the ability of horizontal gene transfer, temperate phages also affect the fitness and phenotype of their host bacteria (Argov et al., 2017; Howard-Varona et al., 2017). One attractive phenotype of pathogenic bacteria is the virulence, which determines the pathogenicity of the infectious disease. Particularly, the temperate phages can increase the virulence of the host bacteria by transmitting virulence genes, many of which were identified in phage genomes (Boyd, 2012).",

However, temperate phage-mediated attenuation of virulence was rarely found. In this study, we reported a temperate phage PHB09 isolated from sewage water, and found that lysogeny of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 both in vitro (Figure 3) and in vivo (Figure 4). Sequence and morphological analysis indicated that it is a new phage and can be classified to Siphoviridae family. The genome of PHB09 encodes one tRNA gene and 59 putative ORFs (Figure 2A and Table S1), and no antibiotic resistance genes were identified (Table S2). Lysogeny related genes including integrase, which shows 40% identity to the integrase of Pseudomonas phage phiAH14a, and cI gene were identified.",

We found the integration site of phage PHB09 in B. bronchiseptica genome is specific (Figures 2B,C) and locates in a gene coding a pilin protein, which showed the highest homology with Oligella urethralis pilin protein (Figure S1). Integration of phage PHB09 disrupts gene for the expression of pilin protein, which might lead to attenuation of B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01+. Pilin proteins form hair-like pili, which are found on the surfaces of bacteria, usually, are responsible for the adhesion to the host cells (Soto and Hultgren, 1999; Winther-Larsen et al., 2001). Many studies have identified pilin proteins as virulent factors of pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli (Soto and Hultgren, 1999) and Vibrio cholera (Utada et al., 2014). Recently studies reported that pili of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to sense the extracellular signals, leading to the expression of hundreds of genes associated with pathogenicity (Persat et al., 2015). Therefore, it is possible that phage PHB09 mediated attenuation of B. bronchiseptica through disruption of the pilin gene. We tried to knock out the pili gene of B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01, but failed because it is very hard to edit B. bronchiseptica genome. Further studies are needed to confirm this possibility once the genome editing methods are available.",

Most of the live attenuated vaccines were developed by mutating or deleting the virulence-associated gene(s) (Minor, 2015). Integration of a temperate phage disrupts gene for the expression of bacterial virulent gene, which will lead to the attenuation of the pathogen, and could be a new strategy to develop bacterial vaccines. However, it is well-known that prophages can switch to the lytic life cycle, in which the prophage DNA is excised from the host genome. Although such process often accompanied by lysis of the host cells, curing of prophages from host bacteria was reported in some bacteria (Euler et al., 2016; Aucouturier et al., 2018). Therefore, it is necessary to ensure there is no spontaneous release of prophage before using a lysogenized bacterium as a live attenuated vaccine. In case of prophage PHB09, we found that the induction of phage PHB09 always led to the lysis of B. bronchiseptica Bb01+. Therefore, there is little chance for B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ to reverse to the virulent state by release of prophage PHB09. Additionally, rather than a live attenuated vaccine, B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ can be used as an avirulent seed strain to develop inactivated vaccines.",
