            "text": "RNA-protein interactions (RPI) play a crucial role in fundamental cellular processes, such as human diseases (1), viral replication and transcription (2,3) and pathogen resistance in plants (4\u20136). Recent high-throughput techniques produce remarkable evidences to prove that protein can interact with RNA to mediate different kinds of cellular functions. During the post-transcriptional regulation process, RPI complex interacts with targeted mRNAs and/or non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) to regulate cellular functions, such as RNA splicing, RNA transport, RNA stability and RNA translation (7\u20139). Experimental studies on RPI reveal that many functional ncRNAs play pivotal roles in gene expression and regulation (10\u201316). Although a few individual ncRNAs have been well studied, e.g. HOTAIR (17), MALAT-1 (18) and Xist (19), the majority are still not well understood. Over 30 000 ncRNAs have been identified and this number is expected to increase every year (14,15,20). Currently, NPInter (21) is the only database, which provides the functional information for all the experimentally validated ncRNA-protein interactions (ncRPI). The experimental techniques are generally time-consuming and expensive. Our understanding of function of individual ncRNAs is far outpaced by the sheer volume and diversity of the available data. Furthermore, our understanding of ncRPI in gene regulatory networks is very limited, especially when compared to the regulatory roles of protein\u2013protein and DNA\u2013protein complexes. This is because the advances in genomics and proteomics techniques have resulted in tremendous amounts of data on protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013DNA interactions (22\u201324); however, much less information is available on ncRPI.",

            "text": "In despite of the increasing amount (\u223c400) of successfully identified RNA binding proteins (RBP) in the human genome (25,26), we still lack a complete understanding of RPI complexes and their roles in post-transcriptional regulatory networks (7,27). Although the sequence-homology-based approaches, such as Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (28\u201330) and PFAM (31\u201333), helped in detecting the functional regions (binding domains) of proteins and therefore the possible functions, these approaches lack the ability to identify the interacting partners (RNAs) for a given protein, or determine whether a given pair of protein and RNA can form interaction or not. To our knowledge, currently very few computational approaches are available to predict RPIs. One of the first computational methods for predicting ncRPI was reported in 2011 by Pancaldi and B\u00e4hler (34). They trained random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers using more than 100 features extracted from protein secondary structure and localization, protein and gene physical properties and untranslated regions (UTRs). Thereafter, catRAPID (35) was developed by exploiting the physicochemical properties including secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals propensities. Next, Muppirala et al. (36) introduced a method called RPISeq, which was constructed by using the features derived from protein and RNA sequences. They also trained RF and SVM classifiers using 3-mer and 4-mer conjoint triad features for amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively (37). Wang et al. (38) proposed an approach based on Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) and Extended NB (ENB) classifiers using the same data sets and similar triad features reported in Muppirala et al.'s work. More recently, Lu et al. (39) proposed a method called \u2018lncPro\u2019 for predicting ncRNA-protein associations, using Fisher linear discriminant approach. His training features were three types of classical protein secondary structures, hydrogen-bond and Van der Waals propensities, as well as six types of RNA secondary structures (RSS).",

In addition to sequence features, we combine the high-order structures of both proteins and RNAs, for a comprehensive understanding of RPI interactions. We consider the protein structures in terms of 16 structural fragments called protein blocks (PBs) (41). The PBs provide a more accurate representation of known protein structures than classical three state protein secondary structures (\u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet and coil), and have been applied in many protein structure-based analysis (42,43). For the RNA high-order structure, we considered five classes of RSS, namely, stem, hairpin, loop, bulges and internal loop. These PB and RSS were combined with their corresponding amino acid and nucleotide sequences. Using these features, we developed a SVM-based machine learning approach, RPI-Pred, to predict protein-RNA interactions. Our training database was constructed using sequence and experimentally validated structures of proteins and RNAs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (44). We also used sequence and predicted structures to test our RPI-Pred on different data sets, such as RPI369 and RPI2241, and ncRPI data sets, such as RPI367, RPI13243 and NPInter10412 (21). We extended our analysis to construct an in silico network to study potential interactions between proteins and ncRNAs, which can help us in further understanding of ncRNA's functions. Finally, a web server for this proposed method was also developed and freely accessed at http://ctsb.is.wfubmc.edu/projects/rpi-pred.",

Step 1 includes various processes, such as construction of the training data set, removal of redundant RNA-protein pairs, feature extraction from sequences and structures in the training data set and development of the \u2018RPI-Pred\u2019 model. Step 2 includes the feature extraction in terms of primary sequence and predicted structure for given protein and/or ncRNA and ncRPI prediction using RPI-Pred. Step 3 consists of construction of interaction networks based on RPI-Pred interaction predictions. More detailed descriptions for each step are given below.",

For instance, the RPI complex with the PDB id \u20181a9n\u2019 has four protein chains (A, B, C, D) and two RNA chains (Q, R), respectively. We obtained the possible interaction pairs from PRIDB as A-Q, B-Q, C-R and D-R. Then the homologous RNA-protein pairs (i.e. similar protein chains interacting with similar RNA chains) were removed by searching the sequence similarity between protein (RNA) sequences. In this study, we used EMBOSS needle program (46) with the standard sequence identity cut-off \u226530% to remove proteins (and RNA chains) with a high sequence similarity. In the current example with \u20181a9n\u2019, the protein chains A&C, B&D and RNA chains Q&R are 100% sequence-similar, therefore, we removed the redundant protein pairs. Finally, A-Q and B-Q were identified as non-redundant RNA-protein pairs.",

This distance threshold helped to strengthen positive pairs in the training data set by including only strongly interacting RPI pairs. Different thresholds have been used to distinguish the binding RNA-protein pairs from non-binding ones (35,36,38,39,47). We used the threshold 3.40 \u00c5 (47). The threshold 3.4 \u00c5 is reasonable and sufficient to cover \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018moderate\u2019 hydrogen bonds and energy-rich van der Waals contacts (48). Therefore, we set the threshold (3.4 \u00c5) to distinguish the strongly interacting protein-RNA pairs (positive pairs) and weakly interacting protein-RNA pairs (negative pairs). In the above given example, the pair B-Q, which had at least two atoms, one from protein and another from RNA, with distance \u22643.40 \u00c5, was considered as a positive pair. The pair A-Q, which had no atom\u2013atom distance within the threshold, was considered as a negative pair. This procedure was applied to all 1336 RNA-protein complexes to identify the positive and negative pairs. Further, the peptides (protein with sequence length <25 amino acids) and small RNA (with sequence lengths <15 nucleotides) were excluded from these positive and negative data sets.",

Also inclusion of structure features can improve the RPI prediction (36). Slightly lower prediction accuracy was observed for the RPI2241 data set, which contained more ribosomal RNAs paired with proteins. Ribosomal RNA structures are more likely to contain pseudo-knot structures (40,65\u201367). However, the RNA-fold which was used in this work does not have the ability to predict such structures, and thus the proposed RPI-Pred cannot consider pseudo-knot structures. This may affect the correct prediction of ribosomal RNAs interacting with proteins. Further, Muppirala et al. (36) used 3-mer sequence features while our RPI-Pred uses 1-mer features of sequence and structure to perform RPI prediction. This leads to an increased dimensionality in feature space, which could lead to an improved prediction.

For the remaining measurements AUC, PRE, REC and FSC, the performance was 0.89, 0.79, 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. Compare with the results obtained using known structures as reported earlier (0.97, 0.94, 0.95 and 0.95 for AUC, PRE, REC and FSC, respectively). In particular, the prediction accuracy (ACC) decreased by nearly 10% compared with the performance of RPI-Pred on RPI1807 data set with known structures. We can observe similar decreases in the other performance measures. Expectedly, precision was significantly reduced when using predicted structures, while there was little or no impact on precision.

Therefore, studying ncRPI can reveal the importance of ncRNA in the post-transcriptional regulatory process. Very few computational studies (34\u201339) have been developed to predict the binding partner either for protein or ncRNA using both sequence and structural information. Here, we investigated the performance of our RPI-Pred in terms of predicting the binding partner for a given protein or ncRNA using both sequence and high-order structural information.

We compared the RPI-Pred prediction results with Wang et al.'s four classifiers (RPI369-NB (62%), RPI369-NB (77%), RPI2241-ENB (66%) and RPI2241-ENB (79%) results on the RPI367 data set. Our RPI-Pred method outperformed with a prediction accuracy of 89% (328 out of 367 pairs were correctly predicted), and none of Wang et al.'s classifiers performed at more than 80% accuracy (38). When compared prediction results from Wang et al.'s classifiers, RPI369-NB (62%), RPI369-NB (77%), RPI2241-ENB (66%) and RPI2241-ENB (79%), our RPI-Pred result showed greater improvement in prediction accuracy by 27%, 22%, 23% and 10%, respectively.
