However, the pharmacokinetic properties and concerns for resistance [5\u20137], make it unsuitable in patients with severe life-threatening infection and are unable to take oral medication. The bioavailability of oseltamivir has not been extensively studied in patients who are on mechanical ventilation and feed via a nasogastric tube. A small study investigated its pharmacokinetic effects only for three patients with severe H5N1 influenza [8]. Therefore, other therapeutic strategies, such as intravenous (IV) use of zanamivir, may be of benefit. An international, phase 3 randomized control trial, demonstrated that IV zanamivir had similar antiviral efficacy and safety profile to oral oseltamivir in patients with severe influenza infection [9]. Moreover, time to clinical response did not differ between 600 mg and 300 mg twice daily treatments.",

Besides A(H1N1)pdm09, this test targets a respiratory panel consisting of several viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus HKU1, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus NL63, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A, influenza A/H1, influenza A/H3, influenza B, parainfluenza 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus) and three bacteria (B. pertussis, C. pneumoniae, and M. pneumoniae). In summary, the test pouch contains all dry reagents required for specimen extraction, first-stage multiplex PCR, and individual second-stage real-time PCRs. Operatively, the pouch was placed in the FilmArray\u00ae instrument, and a pre-programmed run was initiated. Results were generated using amplification and melting curve data. Negative controls were certified by the manufacturer before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) approval of the test. All precautions have been used during the procedure to avoid pre-analytical contamination. The test pouch is a sealed, non-reusable item. Negative controls were run periodically to evaluate the performance of the PCR test using sterile collection media. Weekly nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for PCR qualitative analysis to detect viral clearance and were reported as positive or negative indicating presence or absence of the virus in the swab specimen, respectively. No other viruses were detected in this study and virus isolation was not attempted.",

This survival could be attributed to the effects of IV zanamivir, although we cannot underestimate the role of the multidisciplinary proactive treatment approach (combined efforts of infectious disease specialists, intensivists and microbiologists) employed in the management of the patients. Moreover, it should be noticed that none of the four cases was treated with zanamivir alone because all received oseltamivir in addition to zanamivir. Therefore, the latter drug contributed to the treatment effect. Although the two drugs were administered separately, they may also have had an additive or synergistic effect in preventing the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates resistant to one or the other drug, or treating pre-existing resistant isolates more effectively. Indeed, virological potency of antiviral combination therapy for the treatment of influenza was higher than that of oseltamivir monotherapy, although this did not translate into greater clinical efficacy [15]. Moreover, a study in a mice model showed increased survival in animals infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus when treated with oseltamivir-peramivir combination rather than oseltamivir alone [16]. Survival benefit was confirmed in immune-deficient mice infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus treated with oseltamivir and favipiravir compared to those treated with either drugs [17]. However, in the same study, oseltamivir resistance was not prevented with this combination treatment [17]. Lastly, clinical efficacy was not superior with oseltamivir-peramivir combination compared with oseltamivir alone in patients with influenza A (H7N9) infection [18]. In conclusion, it is possible that the administration of both drugs for continued antiviral coverage suppressed possible resistant viral strains and increased clinical efficacy but this hypothesis requires further investigations.",
