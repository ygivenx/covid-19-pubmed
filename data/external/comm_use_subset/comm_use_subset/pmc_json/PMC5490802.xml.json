In pigs, HEV infection alone does not cause clinical disease. HEV genotypes HEV-3 and HEV-4 are the cause of sporadic cases of hepatitis E in developed countries, and are ubiquitous in the pig population worldwide [2]. Hepatitis E is a foodborne zoonosis, for which pork or pork products from infected pigs is one of the risks identified in Europe [1,2] and consumption of processed pork products in the United Kingdom (UK) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of acquiring HEV [3]. Hence, there is a need to better understand factors influencing HEV entering the food chain.",

The economic and welfare impacts of the disease are considerable, as both the breeder and grower segments of the pig industry are affected [5]. All PRRSV infections in the UK characterized to date have been identified as being caused by genotype 1 virus, but the genetic diversity of the virus is continually increasing [6]. The phylogenetic analyses of UK PRRSV sequences have previously been based on data from samples submitted for diagnostic purposes, originating from clinical cases of PRRS, thereby possibly introducing a bias in our coverage of circulating strains. It is therefore possible that PRRSV strains circulating in apparently healthy pigs in the UK may represent a different subset from those causing disease.",

For example, previous studies have shown significant associations between PRRSV presence and Salmonella shedding [10]. Salines et al. [11] reported that experimental co-infection of HEV and PRRSV affected the dynamics of HEV infection. However, a direct immune-regulation in infected pigs could not be confirmed for genotype 1 PRRSV [12], rather suggesting a role for co-infection viruses influencing each other more directly. Moreover, less pathogenic strains of genotype 1 PRRSV seem to cause a more persistent infection than highly pathogenic ones which are better resolved by the immune response [13]. Notably, viruses closely related to the modified-live vaccine used in the UK have previously been found circulating on farms with clinical PRRS [6].",

Approximately 5.7% of pigs were HEV viremic (36/629) and around one in five pigs had evidence of an active HEV infection (129/629), with HEV RNA detected in serum or cecal contents [15]. To follow up these studies, we report here on (1) the investigation of PRRSV active infection (RNA in tonsil) using the same 2013 abattoir survey sample-set and (2) an analysis of the correlation of PRRSV and HEV infection in these pigs, which could be of significance for the control of both diseases and in informing farming practices for reducing HEV in the food chain.",

Only 610 of these plasma samples were also analyzed for the presence of antibodies to HEV, with 354 of these being sero-positive for PRRSV. Tonsil samples from all seropositive or inconclusive pigs were then tested by a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect PRRSV nucleic acid. The tonsils of four other pigs for which plasma samples\u2014and hence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results\u2014were missing were also tested by PCR, while for five seropositive animals the tonsil samples were not available, so a total of 372 tonsil samples were analyzed; only 358 of these animals also had matching HEV PCR data. RNA was extracted from the tonsil samples using the MagNA Pure LC DNA Isolation kit II (Tissue) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK), setting the sample volume to 110 \u03bcL and the elution volume to 200 \u03bcL. A real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid (ORF7) gene of PRRSV and differentiating genotypes 1 and 2 was used [17] with a Stratagene Mx3000P QPCR System (Agilent Genomics, Wokingham, UK). Sequencing of the PRRSV open reading frame 5 (ORF5) gene was subsequently performed on nucleic acids from tonsil samples testing positive in the diagnostic PRRSV PCR to characterize the viruses present [6]. The PCR amplicons were purified using the Beckman AMPure solid phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) technique (Beckman Coulter Ltd., High Wycombe, UK). Cycle sequencing was performed using forward and reverse primers and ABI BigDye chemistry (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK) at the end of which the dye terminators were removed using Beckman CleanSEQ SPRI (Beckman Coulter Ltd., High Wycombe, UK). Samples were sequenced on an ABI capillary electrophoresis DNA analyser (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK) and the raw data analysed by ABI SeqScape software (Applied Biosystems Ltd., Warrington, UK). The resulting sequences were aligned with 48 reference sequences from GenBank, and with 431 other UK PRRSV ORF5 sequences from samples submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) for PRRS diagnostic testing between 1991 and 2014, using the ClustalW algorithm [18] in MEGA6 [19]. The phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA6 using the neighbour-joining method [20], with the evolutionary distances being computed using the maximum composite likelihood method [21]. The sequences obtained were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MF043094 to MF043116.",

Antibody to vaccine and field PRRSV cannot be distinguished but vaccination of rearing pigs is less common than that of breeding pigs in the UK and is generally performed when there is an expectation of field PRRSV challenge during the rearing period. Therefore, seropositivity in finishers is considered a reasonable indicator of the presence of PRRSV infection on the respective rearing units. From the PRRSV seropositive pigs in the study, the prevalence of PRRS viral RNA in tonsils, where PRRSV may persist up to 130 days post infection [25], was 8.3%. As tonsils from most seronegative pigs were not tested by PCR, it is possible that detection of a few PRRSV-positive pigs in the early stages of infection were missed, although PRRSV RNA was not detected in any of the 28 tonsils from seronegative pigs in a pilot study (data not shown). As the pigs were not showing obvious clinical signs, this is a significant finding, highlighting that a proportion of healthy pigs from PRRSV-infected units may be infectious at slaughter, and if still shedding virus, may be able to transmit the virus on to other farms, for example through contaminated vehicles [26], underlining the need for good biosecurity during and after transport to slaughter. These findings triggered the genetic characterization of the viruses in order to further evaluate the potential risks associated with their presence.",

None of them was from an Eastern European subtype of genotype 1 PRRSV. Of the 23 successfully-sequenced viruses, three showed greater than 98.5% similarity to the modified-live vaccine used in the UK at the time. These \u2018vaccine-like\u2019 viruses may derive from vaccine virus, and have been identified in previous years, although at a lower rate [6], possibly because most samples previously sequenced were from disease outbreaks, whereas these were detected in clinically normal pigs. The other 20 viruses showed between 88.4% and 98.3% similarity to the vaccine sequence. Although the degree of genetic difference of a field PRRS virus from the vaccine strain cannot alone predict the degree of protection that would be afforded by the vaccine to infection by the field virus, nor allow for a determination of the strain\u2019s pathogenicity, these results further illustrate the diverse nature of field PRRSV in the UK. Interestingly, some of the viruses from this study are sufficiently similar to one another to be potentially linked epidemiologically, even when they originate from pigs from different geographic regions. Conversely, for two pigs from the same farm, the viruses detected in them did not show a great degree of similarity. There was no relation between four PRRSV sequences from animals co-infected with HEV (no sequence data was available for the other two), as they each grouped into different clusters in the phylogenetic analysis, one being homologous with the Porcilis PRRS vaccine strain sequence. The sequences from the abattoir samples did not cluster separately from those from clinical cases submitted for diagnostic testing, and they appear to fit within the overall diversity of PRRSV strains previously found to be circulating in the UK. The existence of infected slaughter-age pigs with the potential, if shedding, to transmit the virus to susceptible pigs is thereby confirmed.",

Indeed, pigs exposed to PRRSV were less likely to be viremic (p = 0.05). The age-range of the six co-infected pigs identified reflected that of the overall population sampled. The calculated virus load in plasma for HEV showed no association with either PRRSV serology or PCR status (data not shown). Several other studies have specifically investigated PRRSV and HEV co-infection [11,27,28], some by experimental infection. One report of an association of co-infection with disease was restricted to investigation of a single pig [27]. Martelli et al. [28] found no association between these pathogens in an investigation of diagnostic submissions. The 2013 abattoir survey had investigated the presence of a number of other pathogens in clinically healthy pigs, but no evidence was found that the PRRSV-seropositive pigs were more likely to carry Salmonella or Yersinia or have antibodies to Toxoplasma [14]. Interestingly, Salines et al. [11] reported that experimental PRRSV and HEV co-infection did affect the HEV infection dynamics in five-week old pigs with no maternal antibody for these two endemic viruses. The simultaneous co-infection resulted in delays to both the latent period (13.4 vs. 7.1 days with HEV alone) and the humoral response (43.1 vs. 26.3 days) to HEV, as well as increasing the infectious period (48.6 vs. 9.7 days), in association with an increased HEV viral load. In contrast, several other studies have failed to demonstrate any association between PRRSV infection and the dynamics of other viral infections [13,28,29]. While the present study failed to show any positive association overall between PRRSV and HEV infections, this may be an age-dependent effect, and variation in the timing of the respective infections may also affect their outcomes. Future investigations of natural PRRSV and HEV co-infections should perhaps be directed towards younger pigs, since these were under-represented in this study, and may provide different outcomes. A field study showed that the majority of pigs were infected by 15 weeks of age [30]. Experimental infections to further characterize PRRSV and HEV co-infections must consider non-simultaneous infections, as they may be more relevant to the situation in the field. Other viral co-infections such as porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and PRRSV or HEV also remain to be investigated, with at least one report of fatal disease associated with HEV and PCV-2 [31].",

The UK abattoir survey had found that one in five pigs had an active HEV infection as they entered the food chain [15]. This same finding of active HEV infections in slaughter-age pigs is found worldwide [32,33,34,35]. There was no evidence from the current study that PRRSV infection adversely affected the proportion of HEV infected pigs entering the food chain. Further studies are needed to investigate factors influencing the dynamics of HEV infection in the pig and within farms and that may then be used to inform means of reducing infection in slaughter-age pigs.",
