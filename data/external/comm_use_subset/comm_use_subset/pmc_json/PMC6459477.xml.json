Emerging viral infections can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For instance, the outbreak and subsequent spread of a new bunyavirus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) in China in 2009, was associated with more than 7,000 cases until 2016 and a case-fatality rate of up to 30% [4, 5]. Moreover, SFTS cases have recently also been reported in other Asian countries, including South Korea [6] and Japan [7]. Similarly, the first outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa in 2013 unfolded into a epidemic with more than 10,000 deaths and almost 30,000 cases [8]. At present, there are no approved antiviral drugs against SFTSV, EBOV and several other emerging viruses. The targeting of host cell factors required for spread of these viruses but dispensable for cellular survival is considered a promising approach to antiviral therapy, since the respective drugs might exert broad antiviral activity (in case several viruses depend on the same factor) and might be associated with a high barrier against resistance development.",

            "text": "The glycoproteins of enveloped viruses facilitate viral entry into host cells. For this, they bind to host cell receptors and fuse the viral membrane with a cellular membrane, which allows delivery of the viral genetic information into the host cell cytoplasm [9]. However, viral glycoproteins are synthesized as inactive precursors and depend on priming by host cell proteases to transit into an active form [10, 11]. Priming can occur at different cellular localizations, for instance the constitutive secretory pathway, the plasma membrane and the extracellular space, and can proceed during different stages of viral spread, including glycoprotein biogenesis in infected cells, particle release from infected cells and entry into new target cells [10, 11]. Similarly, different host cell proteases can be hijacked by viruses for priming. For instance, the serine protease SKI-1 and other proprotein convertases are used by Lassa virus (LASV) [12] and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13]), type II transmembrane serine proteases are used by influenza A viruses and coronaviruses [14\u201317] and the endo/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L (CatB/CatL) are used by Ebola virus (EBOV) [18], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [19, 20] and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [21]). Thus, the activity of host cell proteases is required for priming of viral glycoproteins and for viral infectivity and the responsible enzymes constitute potential targets for antiviral intervention.",

In addition, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus Gn/Gc is processed by proprotein convertases [23\u201325]. More recently, Shi and colleagues reported that Gn/Gc of Bunyamwera virus is also processed by signal peptide peptidase (SPP) [26], an intramembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves membrane associated signal peptides following their liberation from nascent proteins by signal peptidase.

For this, we used rhabdoviral pseudotypes bearing SFTSV-Gn/Gc [27] and the SPP inhibitor (Z-LL)2 ketone. As negative control, we employed a SKI-1 inhibitor, PF-429242, since SKI-1 was shown not to be involved in SFTSV Gn/Gc processing [27]. In contrast, SKI-1 processes the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor (LASV-GPC) in infected cells and processing is essential for viral infectivity [12]. Therefore, LASV-GPC bearing pseudotypes were included as control for the inhibitory activity of PF-429242 in our study. Finally, we included rhabdoviral pseudotypes bearing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) and Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) in our analyses, since processing of these glycoproteins and entry driven by these glycoproteins should be independent of SKI-1 and SPP activity.",

We found that infectivity of VSV-G bearing pseudotypes was not markedly modulated by SPP and SKI-1 inhibitors, as expected, although a slight reduction of infectivity was observed in the presence of SKI-1 inhibitor (Fig 1A). Similarly, SKI-1 and SPP inhibitors did not appreciably modulate infectivity of SFTSV-Gn/Gc pseudotypes (Fig 1A).

In contrast, preincubation of target cells with SPP and SKI-1 inhibitor strongly reduced EBOV-GP-driven entry (Fig 1B). Notably, a more profound inhibition of EBOV-GP-mediated entry was observed when target cells were preincubated with SPP and SKI-1 inhibitors as compared to incubation of particle producing cells (Fig 1). Thus, SPP and SKI-1 inhibitor might mainly exert their antiviral activity during EBOV-GP-driven entry. Collectively, these results indicate that activity of SPP and SKI-1 in infected cells and in target cells may not be required for SFTSV and VSV infectious entry. Moreover, our results agree with the finding that LASV-GPC processing by SKI-1 in infected cells is required for viral infectivity.

Preincubation of target cells with SKI-1 and SPP inhibitor reduced EBOV-GP-driven entry in a concentration-dependent fashion but had little effect on entry driven by LASV-GPC and VSV-G (Fig 2A). Moreover, exposure of target cells to SKI-1 and SPP inhibitors reduced transduction mediated by the glycoprotein of the EBOV responsible for the West African Ebola virus disease epidemic (EBOV 2014) and the glycoproteins of other ebolavirus species (Fig 2B). Inhibition of entry driven by the glycoprotein of Lloviu virus (LLOV), the only member of the Cuevavirus genus within the Filoviridae family, was also observed (Fig 2B). In contrast, entry driven by the glycoprotein of Marburg virus (MARV) was only modestly inhibited. Finally, a time-of-addition experiment revealed that SKI-1 and SPP inhibitors efficiently blocked EBOV-GP- but not LASV-GPC- or VSV-G-driven entry when added to target cells before and during exposure to pseudotypes but started to lose inhibitory activity when added at 1 h after the addition of pseudotypes (Fig 2C).

In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying inhibition, we first asked whether SKI-1 inhibitor interferes with the conversion of CatB/CatL proenzymes into their catalytically active single and double chain forms. For this, we used cells transfected to express CatB/CatL. Immunoblot analysis of these cells revealed three prominent bands in the range between 30 and 45 kDa and a faint band of approximately 25 kDa, which likely represent the proform, a processing intermediate or glycoform, the single chain form and the heavy chain part of the double chain form (S1 Fig). Incubation of the CatB/CatL transfected cells with SKI-1 inhibitor at a final concentration of 30 \u03bcM for 24 h inhibited processing of the CatB and CatL proforms into the enzymatically active forms. Thus, production of the CatB/CatL single chain forms was inhibited and, in case of CatL, also the generation of the heavy chain part of the double chain form was blocked while the signals observed for the CatB heavy chain part of the double chain form were too faint to allow interpretation (S1 Fig). In contrast, the SPP inhibitor did not reduce production of the enzymatically active forms of CatB/CatL under the same conditions, but generally reduced CatB expression when tested at the highest concentration (S1 Fig). The conversion of CatB/CatL proenzymes into their active forms occurs in the lysosome. Therefore, we asked whether the SKI-1 inhibitor altered the cellular localization of CatB/CatL. For this, Cos7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding Lamp-1, a cellular protein known to reside in the late endosome/lysosomal compartment, and either CatB, CatL or NPC1 and subsequently treated with the SKI-1 inhibitor, SPP inhibitor or DMSO as a control. Extensive colocalization of CatB, NPC1 and, to a lesser degree, CatL with Lamp-1 was observed (Fig 5), in agreement with published data. Notably, SKI-1 inhibitor treatment markedly disrupted the colocalization of CatB and Lamp-1 (Fig 5A and Fig 5B) while the SPP inhibitor had only a moderate but still statistically significant effect (Fig 5A). In contrast, none of the inhibitors interfered with colocalization of CatL with Lamp-1 (Fig 5C and Fig 5D) and, unexpectedly, the SPP inhibitor reduced NPC1 colocalization with Lamp-1 (Fig 5E and Fig 5F). Although confirmatory experiments with endogenously expressed proteins are pending, these results suggest that SKI-1 inhibitor blocks EBOV-GP-driven entry by reducing CatB localization in late endosomes/lysosomes, the site of EBOV-GP-driven membrane fusion.",

Shi and colleagues have demonstrated that processing of Gn/Gc of another Bunyavirus, Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus, depends on the activity of SPP [26]. Thus, SPP processes NSm, which is part of the Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus Gn/Gc, and processing is required for fusion of infected cells with uninfected cells [26]. For bunyaviruses like SFTSV, which do not possess an internal NSm between Gn and Gc, one may speculate that SPP processes the C-terminal portion of mature Gn proteins that remains in the membrane after separation of Gn and Gc by signal peptidase-mediated cleavage. This triggered us to investigate whether SPP is also required for production of functional SFTSV Gn + Gc, i.e. Gn + Gc that is capable of mediating host cell entry. We included a SKI-1 inhibitor in our studies, since we previously reported that this compound does not interfere with SFTV-Gn/Gc maturation and function [27], although it is well known to block LASV-GPC processing and viral infectivity [12]. Finally, we examined EBOV-GP-driven entry in our study, since entry driven by this glycoprotein should be independent of SKI-1 and SPP activity but should depend on GP processing by CatB/CatL [18]. Unexpectedly, we found that both SPP and SKI-1 inhibitor blocked EBOV-GP- but not SFTSV Gn + Gc-driven entry, raising questions regarding the underlying mechanism.",

Second, directed expression of TMPRSS2, which processes SARS-S and MERS-S at the cell surface and renders SARS-S- and MERS-S-mediated entry CatL-independent [15\u201317, 20], also abrogated the entry blockade installed by SPP and SKI-1 inhibitors (not shown). Third, entry driven by the glycoproteins of Lloviu virus and all ebolaviruses tested, which is known to depend on CatB/CatL activity although to different extends [18, 31\u201333], was also blocked by SPP and SKI-1 inhibitors. Fourth, MARV-GP-mediated entry, which is relatively CatB/CatL-independent [32, 33], was not efficiently blocked by CatB/CatL inhibitors.",

This finding is in contrast to commercial sources offering (Z-LL)2 ketone as a SPP specific inhibitor. However, (Z-LL)2 ketone was originally described as a novel cysteine protease inhibitor [34] and only subsequent experiments revealed that it inhibits SPP, which is a presenilin-type aspartyl protease [35].

Thus, SKI-1 inhibitor might interfere with EBOV-GP-driven entry by modulating cholesterol homeostasis. However, addition of cholesterol did not rescue EBOV-GP-driven from blockade by SKI-1 inhibitor (not shown), in keeping with the recent finding that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis does not interfere with GP-driven entry but blocks GP glycan maturation [37].",

Mature GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase is in turn required for the generation of N-glycans with mannose 6 phosphate (M6P) residues, which serve as a lysosomal targeting signal for CatB/CatL [39] and many other cellular proteins. This raised the question whether blockade of SKI-1 activity might result in mislocalization of CatB. Such a scenario could explain why SKI-1 inhibitor blocked CatB processing, which is known to occur in lysosomes and to be required for enzymatic activity, as well as EBOV-GP-driven entry by. Confocal microscopy indeed revealed that SKI-1 inhibitor treatment reduced colocalization of CatB with Lamp-1, a protein targeted to endosomal/lysosomal membranes independent of the M6P pathway [40, 41]. Thus, SKI-1 most likely inhibits EBOV-GP-mediated entry by reducing the amounts of CatB in late endosomes/lysosomes, the site of GP priming. This scenario is in agreement with a recent study by Flint and colleagues who reported that GNPTAB expression is required for production of enzymatically active CatB and for EBOV-GP-driven host cell entry [42].",

In the light of these findings we would have expected the SKI-1 inhibitor to interfere with the lysosomal localization of both CatB and CatL but altered lysosomal localization of CatL was not detected. However, CatL colocalization with the lysosomal marker Lamp-1 in untreated cells was already lower than that measured for CatB (compare PCC values in Fig 5), in keeping with published data [43, 44], and our assay might not have been sensitive enough to detect disruption of colocalization by SKI-1 inhibitor. It is noteworthy that a minor but statistically significant reduction of CatB/Lamp-1 colocalization was also observed upon treatment of cells with the SPP inhibitor and this inhibitor also markedly interfered with NPC1/Lamp-1 colocalization. The reasons for these effects are at present unknown. However, it should be noted that SPP-L2A, a SPP homologue which is also sensitive to the SPP inhibitor (Z-LL)2 ketone [45], is localized in the membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, it has been shown that lack of SPP-L2A activity disturbs endosomal membrane trafficking and morphology [46], which might explain the reduced colocalization of CatB and NPC1 with Lamp-1 in the presence of the SPP inhibitor. Future studies should reveal whether blockade of SPP-L2A or CatB/CatL activity by SPP inhibitor accounts for the reduced colocalization of NPC1/Lamp-1, since this might impact interpretation of results obtained upon analysis of EBOV entry in the presence of CatB/CatL inhibitors.",
