More often, it was the nurses who visited the doctors' offices for daily work communication, while the doctors rarely visited the nurse stations and their resting rooms, except for the acupuncturist, who was responsible for the entire department and was used to drinking water in nurse station A.

Sequences of each gene were completely identical, suggesting the outbreak was caused by the single viral introduction. Phylogenetic trees of fiber, hexon, and penton genes were constructed by integrating all closely related adenovirus sequences from GenBank (genetic similarity>80%, coverage>90%). The phylogenies showed the outbreak strains belonged to the [P14H11F14] genotype, with hexon genes clustered together with HAdV\u2010B11, and the fiber and penton genes clustered with HAdV\u2010B14 (Figure 2). This genotype is a recently emerged recombination between HAdV\u2010B11 and HAdV\u2010B14 viruses named HAdV55. To confirm the type of HAdV, four randomly selected HAdV strains from two cases with upper respiratory infections and two cases with pneumonia were sequenced for the whole genome (accession number KY070248, KY780931\u2010 KY780933). No variations were observed. The phylogeny of the whole genome sequence confirmed that the outbreak strains fell into the HAdV55 [P14H11F14] clade (Figure 2D).

The most closely related strains were HAdV55 strains that previously circulated in China between 2006 and 2013.",

One or some of them may have introduced the virus from the bar into unit A and then spread it to other units. Other possibilities may exist, as well. One of the first two cases had been reported a 2\u2010day leave 6 days before she was infected. She may have been infected from her community and then introduced the virus to the hospital. The party offered a good chance for viral transmission among the nurses. Transmission from hospital staff to inpatients may have occurred during this outbreak. The interval between the two peaks of the outbreak was about 6 days, approximately equal to the incubation period of the HAdV infection.19 The later peak mainly consisted of inpatients, which may represent secondary cases. Molecular analysis revealed 100% identities of the fiber, hexon, and penton genes from HAdVs isolated in this outbreak.

Current sequences data indicate the oldest strain of HAdV55 [P14H11F14] was identified in Egypt in 2001. In recent years, this virus has been reported to have caused several outbreaks, the majority of which arose in military training facilities. In China, HAdV55 was first identified in 2006 from an outbreak in a senior high school in the Shaanxi province.9 Since then, sporadic cases of HAdV55 infections have been increasingly reported, especially in northern China.14, 20 This first identification of HAdV55 outbreak in southern China suggests this recombinant adenovirus has been widely disseminated in China. The limited data suggest the outbreak strains of HAdV55 in Guangdong were more likely introduced from other regions of China rather than from recombination in local places, as nearly identical strains were identified from Beijing and Chongqing cities for these three genes. Comparative studies conducted between HAdV55 and other types (HAdV\u20107, HAdV\u20103, HAdV\u201014, HAdV\u201050, and HAdV\u2010C) show a higher tendency of more severe illness in HAdV55\u2010infected patients.20 In this outbreak, 11 of 15 infected inpatients developed pneumonia. In contrast, only one staff member was diagnosed with pneumonia, and other staff developed mild and self\u2010limited symptoms. One possible reason may be body immune competence. Recent studies have shown that the immune system plays a crucial role in the clearance of HAdV viremia and survival of the host.21, 22 Owing to underlying conditions, it is more likely for the infected inpatients to develop severe diseases.23, 24 Given the possible association of severe disease with HAdV\u201055, this virus should be considered sooner in such hospital settings to allow appropriate medical care.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report on an HAdV55\u2010associated hospital outbreak. HAdV is an ideal agent for nosocomial transmission due to its prolonged shedding and its resilient nature. It can spread rapidly through close contact with infected patients or by exposure to fomites. During this outbreak, standard infection control procedures, such as hand washing, wearing surgical masks, and hair caps, were implemented as routine policy in the hospital. However, some staff may have adopted these infection control precautions improperly due to negligence or weak control awareness. Furthermore, consistent compliance with contact and droplet precautions only occurred in working areas, but not in the nurse stations and resting rooms during the beginning of the outbreak. The fact that the infected cases remained infectious during the incubation period has generated challenges to infection control. It was not possible to assess the degree of contact between the first two cases and the other infected staff and inpatients. The acupuncturist and some infected nurses in other units had reported visiting histories to unit A before their illness. Restriction for staff to perform patient care was implemented on June 27. It is possible that this measure helped prevent further transmissions from nurses to patients, as no additional inpatients were infected after July 5, about one incubation period past its implementation. To combat nosocomial outbreaks, healthcare settings should ensure that universal precautions and healthcare guidelines are consistently followed.",

            "text": "Our study has limitations. First, several respiratory viruses could cause respiratory infections.25 Previously published data show that it is difficult to make a reliable distinction among these pathogens based on clinical signs and symptoms.26 To ensure case findings, we used a sensitive definition of possible cases in this outbreak, which may include both adenovirus and non\u2010adenovirus infections, as well as infected patients who may not have been involved in this infection cycle. Our investigation found 27 throat swab specimens with a HAdV\u2010positive status, while pathogens for the remaining cases were not fully clarified. Therefore, the attack rate may have been overestimated. More laboratory tests should be carried out to understand pathogenic characteristics. Second, based on our investigation, we implicated that the virus could be intruded from outside of the hospital by the nurse or nurses in unit A. However, without environmental samples and surveys from the bar and the aforementioned nurse's community, the transmission chain cannot be fully clarified. Other possibilities cannot be excluded. Recently, an increasing frequency of HAdV\u201055 infection was observed among patients with acute respiratory disease. However, we have little knowledge on HAdV\u201055 distributions and their molecular evolution in southern China at present. The first HAdV\u201055 identified in Guangzhou was in 2013. A more comprehensive investigation combined with sequential surveillance and monitoring of this agent would be helpful to trace the transmission origin and provide more molecular epidemiology baseline data in China.",
