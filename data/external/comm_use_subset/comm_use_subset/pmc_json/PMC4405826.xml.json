Although treated by adequate surgery, the overall survival of MM at 5 years is less than 10%. For disseminated MM, the appropriate systemic medical treatment is still controversial [2,3]. Identification of new tumor antigens expressed in melanoma and progresses in the molecular biology and immunotherapy should in the near future translate into molecular-based therapeutic strategies [4]. Followed the discovery of a lot of tumor antigens and development of novel strategies, cancer immunotherapy has significantly developed during the last decades and completes the therapeutic arsenal [5,6]. Human preclinical trials of immunotherapy based on the newly defined tumor antigens highly expressed by MMs have now been reported and cast new light on the therapeutic strategies of the disease [7,8].",

BAP31 is an integral ER-resident membrane protein and a component of several large protein complexes [9]. In addition to its role as ER chaperon, BAP31 plays an important role in apoptosis. BAP31 could act as a regulator of procaspase-8 L processing [10] and could be cleaved by caspase-8 [11,12]. The cleaved BAP31 fragment, p20, is a potent inducer of apoptosis when expressed ectopically. Prominent BAP31 protein expression is restricted to a minority of cells in normal human tissues although its RNA transcripts are ubiquitously expressed [13,14].",

            "text": "For the first time, we found that protein expression of hBAP31 were dramatically upregulated in human MM tissues when compared with human normal tissues, with a total positive rate of 86.5% (122 of 141 cases). And predominant protein expression of mBAP31 was found in mouse B16 melanoma cells but not in mouse important organs. So we hypothesized that BAP31 might be used as a promising immunotherapy target for MMs. In this study we constructed mBAP31 DNA vaccines and lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) was used to enhance the immune response against mBAP31. LAMP can target and bind the endosome/lysosome through the LAMP transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain. The luminal domain of LAMP is then integrated into the lysosome. Consequently, one strategy commonly is to insert the target DNA into LAMP as a LAMP/antigen chimera and could greatly enhance the immune response against a number of antigens [15,16]. When C57BL/6 mice were immunized with LAMP-mBAP31 chimera DNA vaccine or mBAP31 DNA vaccine, strong cellular response to mBAP31 was observed and no autoimmune disorders were observed in the vaccinated mice. Moreover, CTLs isolated from mBAP31 DNA vaccine immunized C57BL/6 mice could effectively kill mBAP31-positive target mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells in vitro. Furthermore, in a therapeutic model, vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccine had potent anti-tumor activity even in the established B16 melanoma. These are the first data supporting a vaccine targeting BAP31 that will be applicable to human MMs.",

When C57BL/6 mice were immunized with LAMP-mBAP31 chimera DNA vaccine, stronger cellular response to mBAP31, CTL cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effects in the therapeutic model were observed than mice vaccinated with p-mBAP31 DNA vaccine. Moreover, no autoimmune disorders were observed in the vaccinated mice, suggesting the safety of vaccination with mBAP31 DNA vaccine. These are the first data supporting a vaccine targeting BAP31 that will be applicable to human MMs.",
