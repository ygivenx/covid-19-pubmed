            "text": "Protein-folding homeostasis is critical for proper cell function. Accordingly, cells evolved surveillance mechanisms to monitor protein-folding status and elicit adaptive responses to adjust protein-folding capacity according to need (Balchin et al., 2016; Bukau et al., 2006; Walter and Ron, 2011). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the majority of transmembrane and soluble secretory proteins fold and mature, protein-folding homeostasis is ensured by a network of signaling pathways collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Walter and Ron, 2011). In metazoans, perturbations leading to the accumulation of mis- or unfolded proteins in the ER are recognized as \u2018ER stress\u2019 by three unique ER-resident UPR sensors, IRE1, PERK and ATF6 (Cox et al., 1993; Cox and Walter, 1996; Harding et al., 2000; Niwa et al., 1999; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Tirasophon et al., 2000; Walter and Ron, 2011; Yoshida et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2001). These sensors transmit information about the protein-folding status in the ER and drive gene expression programs that modulate both the protein-folding load and folding capacity of the ER. If ER stress remains unmitigated, the UPR induces pro-apoptotic pathways, thereby placing the network at the center life-or-death decisions that affect the progression of numerous diseases (Bi et al., 2005; Feldman et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2012; Walter and Ron, 2011; Zhang and Kaufman, 2008).",

            "text": "IRE1 drives the most conserved branch of the UPR, which exhibits remarkably similar mechanistic aspects shared between yeast and mammals (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009; Korennykh et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). In mammals, IRE1 exists in two isoforms, \u03b1 and \u03b2. IRE1\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas IRE1\u03b2 expression is restricted to gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts (Bertolotti et al., 2001; Tsuru et al., 2013). Both IRE1 orthologs are trans-membrane kinase/nucleases that oligomerize in the ER-membrane in response to ER stress (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010). Oligomerization is crucial for IRE1 activation as it allows for trans-autophosphorylation and allosteric activation of its endonuclease domain, which for IRE1\u03b1 then initiates the unconventional splicing of the XBP1 mRNA (Arag\u00f3n et al., 2009; Cox et al., 1993; Cox and Walter, 1996; Korennykh et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Sidrauski and Walter, 1997; Yoshida et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 2001). Spliced XBP1 mRNA encodes the transcription factor XBP1s, which activates the transcription of several target genes involved in restoring ER homeostasis (Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2003). While the XBP1 mRNA is the only known splicing target of IRE1, active IRE1 can also cleave ER-localized mRNAs in a process known as regulated IRE1-dependent decay of messenger RNAs (RIDD), which serves to limit the amount of client proteins entering the ER, thus helping alleviate the folding stress (Hollien et al., 2009; Hollien and Weissman, 2006).",

A putative peptide-binding groove that architecturally resembles that of the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) extends across this interface (Credle et al., 2005). yIRE1 selectively binds a misfolded mutant of carboxypeptidase Y (Gly255Arg, CPY*) in vivo, and purified yIRE1 cLD directly interacts with peptides in vitro, leading to its oligomerization. Taken together, these observations support the model that direct binding of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen to IRE1 induces its oligomerization leading to IRE1 activation (Gardner and Walter, 2011).",

Although the crystal structure of human IRE1\u03b1 (hIRE1\u03b1) cLD displays conserved structural elements in its core, there are several notable differences between the crystal structures of human and yeast IRE1 cLD known to date (Figure 1). First, the helices flanking the groove in yIRE1 cLD are too closely juxtaposed in the human structure to allow formation of the MHC-like groove present in the yeast (Zhou et al., 2006). Second, the yIRE1 cLD structure displays a second interface, IF2L, which provides contacts for higher order oligomerization, which was experimentally validated to be indispensable for yIRE1 activation in vivo (Figure 1). In the yIRE1 cLD, an \u03b1-helix\u2013turn region forms an important element in IF2L making contacts with the incomplete \u03b2-propeller in the neighboring protomer. Notably, the residues corresponding to the \u03b1-helix\u2013turn are not resolved in the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD crystal structure (aa V307-Y358). Instead, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD has two other symmetry mates in addition to the dimerization interface, which appear to be crystal lattice contacts that are predicted to be too energetically unstable to form biologically important oligomerization interfaces (Zhou et al., 2006). Indeed, the equivalent of an IF2L cannot form in the depicted hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure because of a steric hindrance from a prominent \u03b1-helix (\u2018\u03b1B helix\u2019; aa V245-I263) that is absent in yIRE1 cLD (Figure 1) (Zhou et al., 2006).",

Such model finds support in the notion that all structures adopted by a protein in a crystal lattice represent a singular snapshot of many possible conformational states. Therefore, it is entirely plausible that human and yeast IRE1 cLD use a common mechanism of activation and that the divergent structures aforementioned represent different states in a spectrum of possible conformational states that the IRE1 cLD from any species could assume. In this scenario, the crystal structure of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD represents a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation that can shift towards an \u2018open\u2019 state to allow peptide binding in the MHC-like groove that is apparent in the structure of the yeast ortholog (Video 1) (Gardner et al., 2013; Gardner and Walter, 2011). As such, this model predicts specific outcomes that can be experimentally tested. Specifically, that (i) human IRE1 \u03b1 cLD can bind to unfolded polypeptides, (ii) unfolded polypeptide binding stabilizes the open conformation of the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, and (iii) the open conformation of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD favors its oligomerization.",

The peptide arrays were composed by tiling 18-mer peptides that step through the entire protein sequence, shifting by three amino acids between adjacent spots. We incubated the peptide arrays with purified hIRE1\u03b1 cLD fused N-terminally to maltose-binding protein (MBP) and probed with an anti-MBP antibody. As shown in Figure 2A (left panel), MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD bound a select subset of peptides on the arrays. To maximize the available sequence space, we analyzed binding of MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to these peptides irrespective of their topological accessibility in the ER lumen. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD recognized peptide sequences found in both the ER-lumenal and cytosolic domains of MPZ, which we considered together in our analyses to define the chemical properties of cLD peptide recognition.

Like BiP, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD favored binding to aromatic and positively charged residues (Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993; Otero et al., 2010). BiP is a highly abundant chaperone in the ER lumen, whereas IRE1 is present at orders of magnitude lower levels (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003). Therefore, if IRE1 and BiP recognize the same regions of unfolded proteins, the peptide-binding activity of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD would depend entirely on saturation of BiP by unfolded substrate proteins\u2014a scenario difficult to reconcile with IRE1\u2019s task of dynamically sensing ER stress. To address this point, we compared the binding preferences of mammalian BiP (fused to an N-terminal 10x-histidine tag) on the same peptide arrays. We found sequences recognized by both hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and BiP (Figure 2A, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B). Importantly, however, we also found profound differences. While IRE1 tolerated both prolines and histidines, BiP strongly disfavored these amino acids (Figure 2B, Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A, p<0.05). Conversely, BiP tolerated serine and threonines, while IRE1 strongly disfavored them. Thus, IRE1 can recognize regions of unfolded proteins to which BiP would not readily bind and vice versa, thereby providing a plausible explanation of how IRE1 could recognize unfolded proteins despite of the vast excess of BiP over hIRE1\u03b1 LD in the ER.",

The measured affinities therefore do not reflect true Kd values). These affinities fall within the same order of magnitude of chaperone binding to unfolded proteins, supporting the notion that similar modes of fast transient interactions with unfolded proteins are adopted by both IRE1 and chaperones (Karag\u00f6z et al., 2014; Marcinowski et al., 2011; Street et al., 2011).",

We further truncated MPZ1-N by two residues at a time from either its N- or C-terminus. Deleting amino acids from the C-terminus gradually decreased the affinity (Figure 2E). By contrast, deletion of the first two hydrophobic residues from the N-terminus (leucine and isoleucine) abolished its binding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 2F). These analyses revealed that the minimum peptide length with a comparable binding affinity to the full-length MPZ1 peptide is a 12-mer. This 12-mer peptide matches the chemical properties we found for hIRE1\u03b1 cLD-binding peptides: it is enriched in aromatics, hydrophobic amino acids and arginines, indicating that specific binding contacts play a role in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s interaction with unfolded proteins.",

Immunoglobulins (IgGs) mature in the ER using a well-characterized folding pathway, wherein the constant region domain of the IgG heavy chain (CH1) remains disordered until it binds to its cognate partner, the constant region domain of the IgG light chain CL (Feige et al., 2009). We measured the binding affinity of CH1 to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD by thermophoresis, which reports on changes in the hydration shell of a biomolecule upon interaction with a partner in solution (Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2011). By contrast to earlier findings that showed no measurable binding of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to CH1 under different experimental conditions (Carrara et al., 2015), our experiments showed that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD interacts with CH1 with a K1/2 = 29.2 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5M (Figure 2G). To further validate this observation, we measured binding of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD to another model unfolded protein by fluorescence anisotropy, the folding mutant of staphylococcal nuclease \u0394131\u0394 (Street et al., 2011). We observed a comparable binding affinity of K1/2 = 21.4 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b5M (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). Our data thus show that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binds to full-length unfolded proteins with similar affinity as peptides, suggesting that these proteins display a distinct single binding site for hIRE1\u03b1 cLD.",

NMR spectroscopy reveals structural information at the atomic level for dynamic protein complexes and is well suited to study structural changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD upon its interaction with peptides and unfolded proteins. The hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimer is ~80 kDa and thus is well above the size limit for conventional NMR approaches. We therefore used methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (methyl-TROSY), a specific NMR method that allows to extract structural information from large proteins after selective isotopic labeling of side chain methyl groups with carbon-13 (13C) (Tugarinov et al., 2004; Tugarinov et al., 2007) in select amino acids including isoleucines. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD has 12 isoleucines per monomer, which are evenly distributed throughout the protein (Figure 3A). In hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s methyl-TROSY spectra, we resolved seven peaks corresponding to isoleucines (Figure 3B), which then served as sensors of peptide binding and accompanying conformational changes. All isoleucine peaks in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s NMR spectrum displayed broad line widths (Figure 3B), which is indicative of chemical exchange resulting from hIRE1\u03b1 cLD sampling multiple conformational states at the conditions of the NMR experiments. These data revealed that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD is dynamic in solution.",

A largely overlapping subset of isoleucine and threonine peaks shifted when hIRE1\u03b1 cLD bound to the peptides MPZ1 or 8ab1, indicating a change in a localized environment upon peptide binding (Figure 4A,B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C). Yet, a subset of isoleucine and threonine peaks displayed peptide specific changes. The chemical shifts displayed by the isoleucine peaks were not very large yet reproducible upon binding of different peptides allowing us to probe peptide induced changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD. By contrast, the threonine peaks displayed larger chemical shifts, which is expected from their higher solvent exposure rendering them more sensitive to binding events (Figure 4B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B and C). Mapping the chemical shift perturbations of the isoleucine peaks upon peptide binding on the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure (Figure 4A\u2013E, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2) revealed that the isoleucine resonances that shifted most significantly lie on the floor of the central \u03b2-sheet (marked by Ile124, Ile128, Thr159Ile) (Figure 4D and E). Among these isoleucines, only the side chain of Thr159Ile faces towards the MHC-like groove. We noted that in comparison to the isoleucines 124 and 128, Thr159Ile peak displayed a larger shift upon peptide binding (Figure 4C and E, Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D). In addition to the central \u03b2-sheet floor, the \u03b1B helix that lies at the ends of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD dimer (marked by Ile263), and the \u03b2-sandwich connecting the \u03b2-sheet floor to the \u03b1B helix (marked by Ile52) were affected, albeit to a lesser extent. By contrast, the unstructured loop extending from the MHC-like groove (marked by Ile186) was only slightly affected and the isoleucines positioned in the flexible region that are not resolved in the crystal structure (marked by Ile326 and Ile334) did not shift (Figure 4D,E).",

Taken together, these results indicate that peptide as well as unfolded protein binding populate a distinct conformational state of hRE1\u03b1 cLD, consistent with a peptide-induced closed-to-open conformational transition.

The unpaired electron in the spin label broadens (in a range of 1 to 2.5 nm) or entirely erases (distances <1 nm) NMR signals in its vicinity in a distance dependent manner (Gottstein et al., 2012). Binding of the spin label attached peptide to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD would result in a decrease in the intensity of isoleucine peaks depending on their relative distance to the peptide-binding site. Therefore, we analyzed the changes in the intensities of all isoleucine signals upon binding of MPZ1-proxyl peptide to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 5B, Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C). Binding of MPZ1-proxyl to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD erased the otherwise very strong signal of Leu186Ile and broadened that of Ile124 (Figure 5B\u2013D and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C). Importantly, Ile128 and Ile263 signals, which shifted upon MPZ1 binding as discussed above (Figure 4E), broadened to a lesser extent, suggesting that these residues lie further from the peptide-binding site (Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C and D). Their resonances therefore shifted due to peptide-induced distant conformational rearrangements. Displaying the normalized PRE effect on hIRE1\u03b1 cLD structure revealed that MPZ1-proxyl binding mapped to the center of the MHC-like groove, suggesting that peptides bind to MHC-like groove and induce distant conformational changes in hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 5D).",

Notably, binding of MPZ1-N to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD at the NMR concentrations sharpened the tetramer peak and induced formation of larger oligomeric species in these experiments (Figure 6A). The peptide concentration used in these experiments does not saturate hIRE1\u03b1 cLD molecules based on a determined K1/2 of 16.0 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5M, therefore only a small population of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD formed higher oligomers (depicted as the pink area) (Figure 6A).",

These coupled, global conformational differences observed by NMR strongly underscore the notion that oligomeric hIRE1\u03b1 cLD adopts an active conformation and displays higher affinity for unfolded protein ligands.

Denaturing SDS-PAGE analysis of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD after cross-linking revealed that cross-linking captured oligomeric hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Figure 7A, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1). We separately isolated the bands corresponding to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD monomers, dimers and higher oligomers from the gel and analyzed peptides by mass spectrometry. We identified cross-linked peptides by accurate mass measurement of both candidate peptides and their fragment ions (Chu et al., 2010; Trnka et al., 2014).

Thus peptide binding-induced conformational changes in isoleucines distant to the peptide binding site persisted in the hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L mutant. Interestingly, MPZ1-N-2X binding shifted isoleucine peaks in the same direction and to a similar extent as binding of MPZ1-N, indicating that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD IF2L binds to the same site in these peptides (Figure 7G, Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4B and C).

To this end, we introduced the hIRE1\u03b1 IF2L mutant into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for both isoforms of IRE1 (IRE1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212/IRE1\u03b2\u2212/\u2212). In addition, we attached a GFP tag to IRE1\u2019s cytoplasmic flexible linker retaining its function as published previously for HEK293 cells (Li et al., 2010).

In these cell lines, we controlled hIRE1\u03b1 expression via a doxycycline-inducible promoter. In the absence of doxycycline, cells expressed low levels of hIRE1\u03b1 due to the leakiness of the promoter. In those conditions, the expression level of the hIRE1\u03b1-GFP-IF2L mutant was similar to hIRE1\u03b1-GFP and to the level of endogenous IRE1\u03b1 from wild-type MEFs, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Figure 8A,B).",

IRE1\u2019s RNase activity is preceded by the autophosphorylation of its kinase domain, which can be monitored by a phospho-specific antibody.

Here, we provide evidence that activation of human IRE1\u03b1 occurs via direct recognition of unfolded proteins and that the mechanism of ER stress sensing is conserved from yeast to mammals. This conclusion is based on six independent lines of evidence. First, we found that hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binds peptides with a characteristic amino acid bias. Second, NMR spectroscopy suggested that peptides bind to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s MHC-like groove and induce a conformational change including the distant \u03b1B helix. In this way, occupation of the peptide-binding groove is allosterically communicated, which, we propose, culminates in the formation of a functional oligomerization interface corresponding to IF2L in yIRE1 cLD. Third, binding of minimal-length peptides induces formation of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers as assessed by AUC analyses, further supporting this notion. Fourth, cross-linking experiments captured the oligomerization interfaces, which allowed identification of a functionally crucial hydrophobic patch at IF2L. Fifth, mutation of this patch uncoupled peptide binding from oligomerization but retained the allosteric coupling within the domain. Sixth, impairing the oligomerization of hIRE1\u03b1 cLD abolished IRE1\u2019s activity in living cells, attesting to the physiological relevance of the activation mechanism proposed here.",

These conformational rearrangements then lead to RNase activation, and thus allowing information flow across the ER membrane. Interestingly, our data show that impairment of lumenal domain oligomerization diminished IRE1\u2019s both RNase and kinase activities in cells.",

Although it is clear that BiP is released from IRE1 upon ER stress (Bertolotti et al., 2000), current models proposing BiP as the primary regulator of IRE1 activity do not address how active IRE1 oligomers would form (Carrara et al., 2015; Oikawa et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2006). By contrast, our data indicate that peptide-binding is important for lumenal domain-driven IRE1 oligomerization, leading to its activation. We therefore consider it most plausible that BiP binding modulates the response via tuning IRE1\u2019s oligomerization equilibrium, similar to what was shown for the yeast counterpart (Pincus et al., 2010). In this way, BiP binding would buffer IRE1 activity at the early stages of the ER stress when the chaperones are not overwhelmed by the unfolded protein load, and during the deactivation phase, when the protein folding homeostasis is achieved. In this scenario, unfolded protein accumulation exerts synergistic effects on IRE1 activation, simultaneously freeing more IRE1 from BiP upon ER stress and inducing IRE1\u2019s oligomerization/activation through their direct binding to the sensor (Pincus et al., 2010).",

Whereas yIRE1 cLD precipitously assembles into larger oligomers at concentrations that exceed its dimerization constant (Gardner and Walter, 2011), hIRE1\u03b1 cLD forms discrete dimers, which in a concentration-dependent manner gradually assemble into tetramers. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD oligomers are in a dynamic equilibrium of different states, apparent from our size exclusion chromatography and AUC analyses and hIRE1\u03b1 cLD forms even larger oligomers when bound to peptides. These observations are consistent with the model that the \u03b1B helix, which may hinder formation of hIRE1\u03b1 oligomers as previously suggested (Zhou et al., 2006) participates in conformational changes that release its block on oligomerization. At higher hIRE1\u03b1 cLD concentrations, the conformational equilibrium of the \u03b1B helix is shifted towards the active state. Peptide binding allosterically releases this inhibition and stabilizes the active hIRE1\u03b1 oligomers. We anticipate that the effect of peptide binding-induced oligomerization would be more pronounced under physiological conditions, where hIRE1\u03b1 is tethered to ER-membrane with diffusion limited to two dimensions.",

Notably, assuming an extended peptide backbone with an average length of 3.4 \u00c5 per peptide bond, a 12-mer peptide can fit without constraints into the 39 \u00c5-long groove in the structural model presented here. This notion suggests that the groove ensures preferential binding of fully exposed, unfolded 39\u00c5-stretch of a polypeptide chain. This recognition principle is therefore similar to that of Hsp70-type chaperones, where the structural constraints in the cavity of the substrate-binding domain allow interaction with the substrates only in their extended, unfolded conformation, although Hsp70 only binds a seven amino acids stretch (R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997a; R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997b).",

Importantly, the presence of distinct hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binding peptides liberates IRE1 from an otherwise inevitable failure to compete with highly abundant BiP for binding sites in unfolded proteins. hIRE1\u03b1 cLD\u2019s affinity for peptides measured here varied between 5 and 30 \u00b5M, which is within the same order of magnitude but at the lower range of those reported for most chaperones (Karag\u00f6z et al., 2014; Marcinowski et al., 2011; Street et al., 2011). For example, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD binds the IgG\u2019s CH1 unfolded domain with ~30 \u00b5M affinity whereas BiP was shown to bind the same protein with ~7 \u00b5M (Marcinowski et al., 2011). We surmise that this difference has been selected in evolution to set the threshold for unfolded protein recognition slightly higher for the UPR sensors when compared to that of chaperones so that the UPR is not triggered until a critical concentration of unfolded proteins accumulates. Moreover, our data with the MPZ1-N-2X peptide suggested that IRE1 could display higher affinity for select polypeptides that present more than a single IRE1 binding site.",

Depending on the disease context, IRE1 makes life or death decisions in response to altered ER function manifested in these pathological conditions (Walter P. and D., 2011). Our data showing that unfolded proteins stabilize a distinct IRE1 conformation suggest novel approaches to manipulate IRE1 pharmacologically. For example, it will be promising to design or screen for small molecule modulators that lock IRE1\u2019s groove in the open or closed conformation based on the chemical signature of the IRE1 binding peptides identified here. Such compounds could act as agonists or antagonists of IRE1 activity. As such, it should be possible to develop new classes of pharmaceuticals to induce or inhibit the IRE1 branch of the UPR, driving the desired IRE1 output depending on the disease context.",

To express His10-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD, hIRE1\u03b1 cLD was cloned into pet16b(+) vector containing a FactorXa protease cleavage site. Additionally, His10-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and IRE1 LD coding sequences were cloned into pet47b(+) vector with a preScission protease cleavage site. Hamster BiP with an N-terminal His10-tag was cloned into pet16b(+) vector, which was modified to introduce a preScission protease site C-terminal to the His10-tag. For expression of the proteins, the plasmid of interest was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3* RIPL (Agilent Technologies) or Rosetta2 cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in Luria Broth at 37\u00b0C until OD600 = 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG, and cells were grown at 21\u00b0C overnight. For selective labeling, cells were grown according to published protocols (Tugarinov and Kay, 2004). Briefly, cells were grown at minimal media in D2O supplemented with deuterated glucose as the primary carbon source. For purification, cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 400 mM NaCl, 4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)(or 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, if a nickel column was used)) and were lysed in an Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3 cell disruptor at 16,000 psi. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation for 40 min at 30,000xg. MBP-IRE1 cLD constructs were purified on an MBP-amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and eluted with 10 mM amylose in Elution Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT) after washing the column with 20 column volumes of Lysis Buffer. The eluate was then diluted with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) buffer to 50 mM NaCl and applied to a MonoQ ion exchange column and eluted with a linear gradient from 50 mM to 1 M NaCl. The protein was further purified on a Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). The initial purification of His6- and His10-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and His10-BiP constructs were performed on a His-TRAP column (GE Healthcare), where the protein was eluted with gradient from 20 mM to 500 mM imidazole. The eluate was purified on a MonoQ column, before the His6-tag (pet47b+) or His10-tag (pet16b+) were removed by either PreScission protease (GE Healthcare, 1 unit of enzyme for 100 \u00b5g of protein) or FactorXa (NEB, 1 \u00b5g of FactorXa per 100 \u00b5g of protein), respectively. The tag removal was performed at 4o C overnight after the protein concentration was adjusted to 1 mg/mL. CH1 domain of IgG was purified under reducing conditions as described (Feige et al., 2009).

The arrays were incubated in 100% methanol for 10 min, then in Binding Buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20, 2 mM DTT) three times for 10 min each. For BiP experiments, ADP and MgCl2 were added to the binding buffer to final concentrations of 1 mM and 5 mM, respectively. The arrays were then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with 500 nM MBP-hIRE1\u03b1 cLD or His10-BiP and washed again three times with 10 min incubation in between the washes in Binding Buffer to remove any unbound protein. Using a semi-dry transfer apparatus, the bound protein was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and detected with anti-MBP antiserum (NEB) or anti-His6 antibody (Abcam). The contribution of each amino acid to hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and BiP binding was calculated as described previously (Gardner and Walter, 2011). The peptide arrays were quantified using Max Quant. The binding intensity in each spot was normalized to max signal intensity in the peptide array. The peptides with the top 10% binding scores were selected and the occurrence of each amino acid in these top-binding peptides was calculated. This value is normalized to their abundance in the arrays (Figure 2A). To calculate experimental error, the amino acid occurrences of top binders were calculated for independent replicates. The statistical significance (p<0.05) is determined using non-paired t-test by the Prism software (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A).",

Wild type hIRE1\u03b1 cLD and quadruple mutant hIRE1\u03b1 cLD (Leu186Ile, Ile326/334/362Val) and single mutant Leu186Ile were used in PRE experiments at 75 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M protein concentration respectively, in the presence and absence of equimolar concentrations of MPZ1-proxyl peptide. We normalized the PRE effect with the surface exposed area displayed by that isoleucine to exclude possible contributions from non-specific interactions with the spin label attached peptide (Clore and Iwahara, 2009). The normalized PRE values are calculated as follows, the solvent accessible surface area for isoleucines are calculated using the \u2018GETAREA\u2019 webserver (http://curie.utmb.edu/getarea.html, [Fraczkiewicz and Braun, 1998]) based on hIRE1\u03b1 cLD crystal structure. The maximum solvent accessible surface by these isoleucines is normalized to one and the normalized values are multiplied with the PRE effect. The PRE effect is calculated by dividing the intensity of isoleucine signals in the control experiments with the isoleucine signals in the presence of MPZ1-proxyl peptide.",
