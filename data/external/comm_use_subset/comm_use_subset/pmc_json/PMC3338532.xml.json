Although those procedures are known to stimulate coughing and to promote the generation of aerosols, their risk of transmission of infection is not known with certainty. It is worth emphasizing that the scientific evidence for the creation of aerosols associated with these procedures, the burden of potential viable microbes within the created aerosols, and the mechanism of transmission to the host have not been well studied. It is unclear whether these procedures pose a higher risk of transmission and whether HCWs caring for patients undergoing the aerosol generating procedures are at higher risk of contracting the diseases compared to HCWs caring for patients not undergoing these procedures.",

Inadequate spacing, and the ineffectiveness of personal protective equipment may also contribute to nosocomial transmission [4]. There is some evidence that training programs and the use of personal protective equipment are associated with a decreased risk of transmission of SARS [10]. For instance, with proper control measures in three key areas (including staff personal protection, categorization of patients to stratify risk of SARS transmission, and reorganization of the operating room), high risk aerosol generating procedures (surgical tracheostomy) performed on SARS patients appeared to be associated with a low risk to HCWs who were in direct contact with the patients in the operating room [11].",

These additional infection control measures include performing aerosol generating procedures in a single room with a minimal number of personnel present; using the most qualified personnel to perform the aerosol generating procedures; and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, specifically facial mask, full waterproof gown, face shield or goggles, and gloves. Many of these guidelines provide recommendations based on expert opinion and little understanding of the actual risk of transmission associated with the aerosol generating procedures.",

The appropriateness of pooling of data was determined based upon the degree of clinical and statistical heterogeneity between trials. Where statistical heterogeneity was found, sensitivity analysis on treatment effect was conducted. The majority of aerosol generating procedures were evaluated in one study, which precluded the need for pooling. Data analysis was performed using Review Manager Software using a random effects model [18]. Effect sizes were reported as odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).

Tracheal intubation may require HCWs to be in close proximity to a patient's airway for prolonged periods of time and the association of transmission of SARS-CoV in this setting would be biologically plausible. The strength of the association is supported by the observation that 7 of the 8 studies revealed that HCWs performing or being exposed to a tracheal intubation had a higher risk of SARS-CoV transmission compared to unexposed HCWs. In addition, the one study in which this observation was not consistent was considered as an outlier and, when removed from the random effects model for transmission, the degree of heterogeneity, as measured by the between-studies variance, dropped from 49.1% to 15.9%. In a random-effects model, the between-studies variance or I2, reflects how much the true population effect sizes differ from single studies of a meta-analysis [30]. The finding of relatively low heterogeneity with removal of the one outlier study provides a certain degree of confidence in the observation, given the consistency of the finding.",

Although the methodologies and results of the included studies differed, overall the evidence from the 10 included studies was of very low quality according to GRADE. In general, limitations in design and imprecision are issues in all studies that led to the very low rating. Furthermore, all of the included studies evaluated the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV and may not be generalizable to other acute respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus. As well, with the exception of tracheal intubation, there were a limited number of studies identified for each procedure, which limits the confidence for an individual observation. In addition, there is difficulty in identifying the specific part of a given procedure, which may be complex and involve several manoeuvres that impart the greatest risk of transmission. There are likely differences which exist related to the degree of infectious aerosol generation associated with various procedures and the actual risk of transmission. We also acknowledge that the findings presented may have been influenced by direct and indirect contact transmission even though this route of transmission should have been minimized with the use of personal protective equipment. We were unable to exclude non-compliance with the use masks, gloves, and gowns during the procedures which were performed, but consider it unlikely that health care workers would use no precautions.",

Four studies included less than 100 patients. The number of HCWs included in the studies, who were exposed to the aerosol generating procedures, was small, ranging from 2 to 120. The sample size of the studies could potentially bias estimates of effects and limit statistical power. Related to this, the number of events was small in a number of studies. As noted in the results, for a number of potentially aerosol generating procedures (bronchoscopy, [27] non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, [26] manipulation of BiPAP mask, [27] and insertion of nasogastric tube [27]) point estimates suggested an increased risk, but confidence intervals were wide and were not statistically significant. Not all HCWs caring for SARS patients were included in the studies, since there were some HCWs who refused to participate in the interview process as outlined in the individual studies. HCWs' recall might be imperfect, thus generating recall bias if some were more complete or more accurate than others. Since the source of transmission (i.e., primary, secondary, or tertiary cases) was sometimes unclear, it is difficult to accurately determine if HCWs were infected directly or indirectly from the index patients.",

However, the evidence included in this review, considered to be of very low quality based on GRADE, does suggest that some procedures potentially capable of generating aerosols have been associated with an increased risk of SARS transmission from SARS-CoV infected patients to HCWs. Of the procedures that were assessed, performing or being exposed to a tracheal intubation appeared to be most consistently associated with transmission of SARS Co-V. While other procedures, including tracheotomy, non-invasive ventilation, and manual ventilation before intubation were associated with an increased risk of SARS infection, given the paucity of studies and lack of robustness, these findings were considered difficult to interpret with respect to drawing firm conclusions. There were no other procedures which were found to be significantly associated with a risk of SARS transmission.",

In addition, the findings serve to highlight the lack of precision in the definition for aerosol generating procedures. Further, the results of this report should not be generalized to all acute respiratory infections because the evidence available is strictly limited to SARS. A significant research gap exists in the epidemiology of the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections from patients undergoing aerosol generating procedures to HCWs, and clinical studies should be carefully planned to address specific questions around the risks of transmission in these settings. Given the importance to policymakers with respect to guidelines and barrier precautions for the protection of HCWs who are providing care for patients who are undergoing aerosol generating procedures, a priority should be established by funding agencies, health care organizations, and governments to foster high quality research in this area.",
