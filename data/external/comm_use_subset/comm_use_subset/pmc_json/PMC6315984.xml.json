            "text": "Foamy viruses (FV) are complex retroviruses that belong to the Retroviridae family and comprise a unique genus within the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily that naturally infect many vertebrates, including feline, simian, bovine, and equine [1]. FV infection in humans is invariably associated with zoonotic transmission from other primate species [2,3]. Despite causing a highly cytopathic effect in many cell types in vitro [4], little is known about the pathogenic potential of FV in vivo. A single case-control study reported the presence of hematological abnormalities in humans infected with gorilla simian foamy viruses (SFVs) [5]. Other studies failed to report diseases associated with FV in either natural infection of nonhuman primates or in zoonotic infection of humans with SFVs [6,7,8,9,10,11]. It has been hypothesized that FVs are not able to cause disease in healthy, naturally-infected individuals due to functional immune systems that control virus infection, but these results may be limited by the small numbers of infected persons followed longitudinally [12]. Similarly, an absence of disease association with FVs may reflect an absence of systematic studies following infected individuals, animals or humans for long periods of time since other retroviruses can take decades for disease appearance and disease is not always found in all infected individuals. For example, persons with SFV infection can also be co-infected with HIV and HTLV but longitudinal studies have not been reported on disease outcomes in these persons [8,13,14]. Other viruses, including cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster and herpes simplex, only rarely cause disease in healthy individuals, but when in co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can become be activated with pathogenic consequences [15]. Similarly, rhesus macaques naturally infected with SFV and experimentally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) progress more frequently to simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) compared to SIV-monoinfected macaques [16]. SIV/SFV co-infection in that study was associated with higher SIV viral loads (VLs), lower CD4+ T-cell counts and lower survival. ",

Upon experimental inoculation, FFV is found in oral mucosa cells 2\u20133 weeks after infection [22], and is initially detected by qPCR in the blood within the first two weeks of infection [23]. In this same study, two peaks of viremia were observed, at days 20 (80\u2013170 FFU/mL blood) and 155 (332\u2013415 FFU/mL blood). Furthermore, domestic cats are naturally infected by two other retroviruses which cause severe immunodeficiency: the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), another complex retrovirus, and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a simple retrovirus characterized by the absence of accessory genes. Infection of cats with FIV or FeLV allows an evaluation of FFV co-infection in hosts with a compromised immune system and determination of FFV pathogenic potential.",

FeLV prevalence ranges between 1\u20133.6% in healthy individuals but between 7.3\u201312.2% in sick cats [26,27,28,29]. The main transmission route of FeLV is oropharyngeal exposure to mucosal secretions containing the virus [30]. Different infection outcomes have been identified in experimentally infected cats over the years. Regressive infection is defined as a transient antigenemia followed by the establishment of low to moderate proviral loads (pVLs) [31,32]. In contrast, viremic cats are considered to have a progressive infection, with high proviral and plasma RNA VLs [32]. Cats with progressive FeLV infection can develop tumors, anemia and immunosuppression and FeLV has also been associated with hematological disorders, immune-mediated diseases, and other syndromes, including neuropathy and reproductive disorders [25].",

FIV prevalence ranges between 0.9\u20134.3% in healthy cats and between 7.9\u201331.3% in sick cats [26,27]. FIV is a feline lentivirus with structure, genome and pathogenesis that parallel those of HIV. Infection occurs primarily through biting [34], but can also occur through vertical transmission [35,36]. Experimentally infected cats undergo an initial acute phase, followed by a chronic or clinically asymptomatic phase, which may persist for over eight years, and a final symptomatic phase, also called feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (FAIDS) [37]. In this phase, opportunistic diseases are observed more frequently, such as neoplasia, myelosuppression, glomerulonephritis, neurological diseases and stomatitis. The risk of developing lymphoid malignancy is estimated to be 5 to 6-fold greater in FIV-infected only cats compared with uninfected cats [38].",

But they mostly focused on FIV/FeLV co-infections. A study by Yamamoto et al. showed that a pre-existent FeLV infection enhanced the expression of FIV in the body and increased the severity of transient primary and chronic secondary stages of FIV infection [42]. Only a single study has evaluated the presence of all three retroviruses in cats [17], but was limited only to prevalence estimates and not their possible interactions or associations with disease. In another study, FeLV and FIV co-infection was examined and showed a greater risk for lymphoid cancers in dually infected cats [38]. The combination of susceptibility to multiple retroviral infections and varied possible disease outcomes makes domestic cats an attractive animal model to study the epidemiology and pathogenesis of co-infection by distinct retroviruses. We examined blood and buccal swab specimens of domestic cats in Brazil for detection and quantification of each feline virus to evaluate their potential association with disease and transmissibility in animals with single or multiple retroviral infections.",

For assay validation, 20 human blood donor PBMC DNAs and five different human cell lines (MCF-7, CEMx174, Jurkat, LNCaP and HeLa) were used as negative controls to assess assay specificity. Specificity and sensitivity were also determined using PBMC lysates from 39 US domestic cats previously found to be FFV-negative (n = 18) or positive (n = 21) by Western blot analysis. These cat specimens were available from a previous study investigating the zoonotic potential of feline retroviruses [48]. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was determined by testing of 60\u2013140 replicates (depending on the copy number) ten and fivefold serial dilutions of plasmids containing a cloned fragment of the FFV int sequence ranging from 100 to a single copy diluted in 1 \u03bcg of negative human gDNA. Once the potential LOD was determined using 10 replicates of the 10-fold dilutions, we used a larger number of five-fold plasmid dilution replicates to further refine the LOD. We tested 60 ten copy replicates, 90 five copy replicates and 140 single copy replicates. Standard curves were constructed using 100\u2013107 copies of plasmid DNA. The number of provirus copies/cell was estimated using the formula:number of copies detected/(DNA quantification in picograms/6 pgs cell)\nwhere the mass for each domestic cat cell genome was considered as six picograms DNA per cell [49]. The amount of DNA in nanograms was measured by spectrophotometry.",

This hypothesis is supported by a previous report showing a delay in the appearance of SFV in the saliva of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected through blood transfusion from an SFV-infected animal [50]. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) shares some features with FV, including a high incidence of infection, a salivary mode of transmission and replication in the oropharyngeal tissues. As it is well established for EBV, it is possible that migratory cells, such as macrophages and other leukocytes initially infected by FV, eventually traffic to the oropharyngeal tissues and spread infection to less differentiated epithelial cells [51].",

We found a 10\u00d7 higher FFV pVL (\u22122.15 log10 copies/cell) in the same tissue compartment in cats. At oral sites, the average NWP SFV pVL was \u22121.3 log10 copies/cell [52] while in OWPs the pVL ranged from \u22123.3 to \u22121 log10 SFV DNA copies/cell [54].

Unlike the previous work with primates [52], we did not find significant differences between the pVL in PBMC and in oral tissues of cats.

We hypothesize that being confined in a household or shelter environment increases the risk of co-infection since these cats may have more intimate contact during grooming or sharing feeding bowls. We also considered possible recruitment bias since clinic cats were suspected to be ill as explained in Methods. These cat behaviors are reported as the most likely routes of FeLV transmission [55], as opposed to biting, which has been more strongly associated with SFV transmission [56]. In our study the FFV prevalence was not different between captive and feral adult cats, while in SFV studies of OWPs the prevalence is higher in adult captive (~70%) [57] than in wild-born primates (~44%) [58], whereas the SFV prevalence in NWP were found very similar in captive and wild animals (14\u201330%) [10]. These differences can likely be explained by some captive cats having outdoor access and in shelters it is not uncommon for the introduction of new individuals from the street, both increasing the likelihood of exposures to potentially infected cats.",

Our results support previous studies showing that pVLs measured by qPCR can be used to identify a regressive infection outcome in which plasma viremia has been cleared [59]. Moreover, the FeLV pVL we detected is within the range reported by others for experimentally and naturally infected cats [60]. However, we show for the first time that naturally-infected cats with progressive FeLV infection can result in death after 35 months of follow-up, although the cause of death cannot be exclusively attributed to FeLV infection. Other studies showed the same outcomes only for experimentally infected cats [60,61]. In one of those studies, progressive and regressive cats were followed for 149 weeks post transfusion and the authors found that 50% (4/8) of regressive cats remained healthy while 100% (2/2) of progressive cats developed non-regenerative anemia and multicentric T-cell lymphoma [61].",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to observe the influence of another retrovirus on FV pVL in buccal swabs. A previous co-infection study conducted in the rhesus macaque model has shown that a pre-existing SFV infection can influence the biology and the outcomes of an SIV infection, including higher plasma SIV VL, a decreasing trend in the CD4+ T-cell counts and a greater number of animal deaths [16]. However, SFV pVLs were not assessed in that study. Herein, with the determination of pVLs of two feline retroviruses (FFV and FeLV), it was possible to observe that FeLV progressive or regressive infections were not able to reactivate FFV from latency in PBMC. However, a recent study showed that FFV pVL in blood was positive correlated in cats with status of FeLV progressive, presence of FeLV-B subtype and positive status for feline coronavirus (FeCoV), demonstrating a mechanism of complex interaction that need to be clarified [62]. Furthermore, co-infected cats with progressive FeLV infection are likely more prone to become FFV-transmissible and vice-versa as evidenced by the higher pVLs in these oral compartments. As the proportion of potential-transmissible FFV infections was similar between FFV monoinfections and in cats with progressive FeLV infections, but lower in regressive FeLV co-infections, we postulate that the latency mechanism in regressive FeLV could also contribute to reduction of the establishment of FFV colonization of the oral cavity. These findings may also be a consequence of an altered disease susceptibility caused by the cats\u2019 virome composition. The virome influences the phenotype of the host in a combinatorial manner by interacting with other components of the microbiome and by interacting with individual variations in host genetics. Together these interactions may influence a range of phenotypes as we observed in the distinct behavior of FeLV progressive and regressive infections as also in the FeLV regressive correlation with reduced FFV saliva transmission [63]. The microbiome composition may also allow the stimulation of specific immune cell subsets, which may carry the FFV proviral DNA, thus indirectly increasing the FFV pVL due to the increased number of cells. We also found that FFV pVL was higher in buccal tissues of FFV/FeLV co-infected cats than among FFV monoinfections. However, we identified a negative correlation between the pVLs of both viruses circulating in this tissue. A previous study has reported FeLV as a cofactor for FIV infection by enhancing the expression and spread of FIV in the host and by increasing the severity of immunodeficiency caused by FIV by an unknown mechanism [42]. Another study evaluated FIV/FeLV interactions in in vitro and in vivo experiments, but did not find evidence of direct viral interactions [63]. Since FeLV is mainly transmitted through saliva [30] and superficial differentiated epithelial cells of the oral mucosa are the major cell types in which FFV replicates [51], we hypothesize that both viruses can infect the same compartment. Just like the Tax protein of HTLV-1 can activate HIV expression in vitro via the LTR [64], FeLV may enhance FFV replication in the oral cavity by a similar mechanism, or related to regulatory protein synergism, or some other means. A simplified model of this hypothesis is presented in Figure 6. Any potential interaction mechanism between these two viruses, and their infectiousness, remains to be determined and any contributions of infectious DNA-containing viral particles compared to integrated proviral DNA sequences was not measured in our study due to the small volumes of materials obtained for analysis.",
