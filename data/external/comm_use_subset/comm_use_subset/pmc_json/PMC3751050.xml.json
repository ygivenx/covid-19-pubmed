Vpr has a variety of biological functions, including cell cycle abnormalities at the G2/M phase and apoptosis of T cells and neuronal cells (for a recent review, see ref. [2]). Notably, it was shown that Vpr was present in the blood of HIV-1-positive patients [3], and we previously reported that 20 of 52 blood samples from HIV-1-positive patients examined were positive for Vpr [4]. Blood Vpr was detected in patients with high titres of HIV-1 and, interestingly, was also detected in patients with low viral titres [4]. On the other hand, purified recombinant Vpr protein (rVpr) functions as a trans-acting factor [5,6], and rVpr activated viral replication in latently infected cells by increasing production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by monocytes [7]. Further analyses revealed that rVpr-induced IL-6 production depended on p38, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP-\u03b2) [7]. These observations suggest that blood Vpr could induce various clinical symptoms, but it remained unclear whether blood Vpr is biologically active.",

            "text": "Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1) and Alu are major endogenous retroelements, accounting for ~17 and ~10% of the human genome, respectively [8,9]. As an autonomous retroelement, L1 can retrotranspose not only itself but also other retroelements, such as Alu and SVA (short interspersed element-variable number tandem repeat-Alu, SINE-VNTR-Alu). Intriguingly, a single human cell contains more than 5 \u00d7 105 copies of L1, 80\u2013100 of which are competent for retrotransposition (L1-RTP) [10]. During early embryogenesis, L1-RTP incidentally disrupts gene structures, leading to the development of inborn errors [11,12]. Of note, approximately 100 types of inheritable diseases have been identified as sporadic cases caused by mutagenic RTP of L1 or Alu [12]. Although most studies of L1-RTP have focused on early embryogenesis [13-16], recent lines of evidence suggest that L1-RTP is also induced in somatic cells [17-20]. In tumors of epithelial-cell origins and hepatomas, de novo L1 insertions were detected in the vicinity of tumor suppressor genes, suggesting that L1-RTP is actively involved in carcinogenesis [21,22]. Because L1-RTP alters cellular properties by causing various genetic alternations, including gene deletions [23,24], DNA damage [25], apoptosis [26] and immune responses [27], deregulation of L1-RTP in somatic cells likely functions as a trigger of various diseases.",

Interestingly, rVpr reproducibly induced L1-RTP in various organs, including the kidney, when administered to mice that harbored human L1 as a transgene (hL1-Tg mice) [28,29]. Clinically, HIV-1-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), which is mainly observed among African-Americans [30], is an end-stage renal deficiency that is found without apparent correlation with the viral load [31,32]. In view of reports that Vpr is a candidate molecule responsible for HIVAN [33,34], we propose that monitoring blood levels of Vpr is important for determining its involvement in the pathogenesis of HIVAN.",

When HuH-7 human hepatoma cells were treated with rVpr, L1-RTP occurred in approximately 50 of 105 cells (Figure 1C, P < 0.02). rVpr caused no apparent cytotoxicity (Additional file 1: Figure S1). The activity of rVpr was also confirmed by a PCR-based assay using pEF06R [37,38], in which the signal intensity of the 140 bp band, which corresponds to a product of L1-RTP, was increased by treatment with rVpr (Figure 1B, lower panel for the rationale of the PCR-based assay and 1D, lane 2). A quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was also carried out using a TaqMan probe designed to detect a junction point of two exons of the EGFP gene (Figure 1B, bottom; see also Additional file 2: Figure S2 for standard qPCR curves). Data revealed that rVpr significantly increased the frequency of L1-RTP (Figure 1E, P < 0.05). Notably, rVpr-induced L1-RTP was completely blocked by 8D1 and C217, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Vpr (Figure 1D, lanes 5 and 6) [4], but not by an irrelevant mAb against a spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Figure 1D, lane 4, SARS). Vpr-induced L1-RTP was also observed in HEK293T cells, in which the activity of ~1 ng/mL rVpr was detected (Figure 1F, lanes 10\u201312; Additional file 3: Figure S3).",

Interestingly, Vpr-induced L1-RTP was detected in patients with low HIV-1 titres (Figure 2D and Additional file 4: Table S1). To confirm this, we carried out immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (IP-WB analysis), and successfully detected Vpr in one of two blood samples that were positive for L1-RTP (no. 15; Additional file 5: Figure S4, arrowhead). Estimated concentration of the blood Vpr, when compared to the signals of standard rVpr, would be approximately 5 ng/mL (Additional file 5: Figure S4).

As shown in Figure 3A, L1-RTP was detected in organs including the lymph nodes, liver, thymus and spleen upon intraperitoneal administration of ~200 ng of rVpr three times every 2 days (Additional file 6: Table S2). Interestingly, the qPCR analysis detected L1-RTP in the kidney after six intravenous administrations of 10 ng of rVpr (Figure 3B). To demonstrate that rVpr-induced L1-RTP was dependent on the reverse transcriptase activity of ORF2 [9], we first carried out in vitro experiments to examine whether rVpr-induced L1-RTP was blocked by nucleotide analogue inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (RTIs) [39,40]. As shown in Figure 3C, stavudine (d4T) and tenofovir inhibited the rVpr activity for L1-RTP induction (lanes 3 and 4), but lamivudine (3TC) and azidothymidine (AZT) did not (lanes 1 and 2). The inhibitory effects of d4T on rVpr-induced L1-RTP were potent, and the compound could effectively block the induction of L1-RTP at a concentration of 5 \u03bcM (Additional file 7: Figure S5). We next investigated the effects of 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-3\u2032-deoxy-4\u2032-ethynylthymidine (4\u2032-Ed4T), a stavudine analogue with more specific activity as an RTI and fewer side effects [41]. As shown in Figure 3D, 50 \u03bcmoles of 4\u2032-Ed4T, when administered intraperitoneally 2 h before intravenous administration of 250 ng of rVpr, efficiently attenuated L1-RTP (compare lanes 2 and 3). qPCR analysis also clearly showed the inhibitory effects of 4\u2032-Ed4T (Figure 3E).",

Interestingly, Vpr contains an LQQLL motif at amino acids 64\u201368 that functions as a sequence motif for binding to host cellular proteins, including p300/histone acetyl transferase [47]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that AhR functions as a cellular factor responsible for rVpr-induced L1-RTP. To prove this, we first assessed the effects of 3\u2032-methoxy-4\u2032-nitroflavone (MNF), an AhR inhibitor [48], and observed that 10 \u03bcM MNF completely blocked rVpr-induced L1-RTP (Additional file 9: Figure S7). Moreover, down-regulation of endogenous AhR expression by AhR siRNA was accompanied by reduced rVpr-induced L1-RTP (see Figure 5A, lane 4, and 5B for a representative result from experiments using two different AhR siRNAs; see also Additional file 10: Figure S8A and B for data obtained using another AhR siRNA). By contrast, down-regulation of ARNT1 by siRNA (Figure 5C) did not attenuate L1-RTP (Figure 5D, lane 9 and Additional file 10: Figure S8D, lane 9). AhR and ARNT1 form a heterodimer (AHR complex) and are involved in the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression in response to environmental pollutants [49]. Both AhR and ARNT1 siRNAs blocked the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan photoproduct (Additional file 11: Figure S9), indicating that each siRNA efficiently inhibited the functional properties of the AHR complex, further suggesting that rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on AhR, but not ARNT1.",

Additionally, IP-WB analysis detected an association between WT-Vpr and AhR (Figure 5F, lane 5), but less interaction of the LA mutant with AhR (Figure 5F, lane 6).

Moreover, L1-RTP is initiated by target-primed reverse transcription within the genome [9], and ORF1 functions as a nucleic acid chaperone during L1-RTP [52]. These observations suggest that ORF1 is recruited to the chromatin fraction in response to rVpr treatment. To demonstrate chromatin recruitment of ORF1, we transfected a plasmid DNA that encodes ORF1 into HuH-7 cells, and then carried out WB analysis of the chromatin fraction of the transfected cells after treatment of rVpr. The rVpr-induced chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was blocked by MAPK inhibitors examined (Figure 7A, lanes 4 and 6) and the AhR siRNA (Figure 7B, lane 4; see also Additional file 13: Figure S11 for results from an independent experiment performed using a different AhR siRNA). To further show that ORF1 and AhR form a complex, we transfected a plasmid DNA encoding a chimeric protein of ORF1 and EGFP (pORF1-EGFP) into HuH-7 cells, and then performed IP-WB analysis. IP using \u03b1-AhR followed by WB analysis using \u03b1-EGFP revealed that ORF1 and AhR were associated (Figure 7C, lane 2). The reverse experiment, in which IP using \u03b1-EGFP was followed by WB using \u03b1-AhR, confirmed formation of this complex (Figure 7C, lane 5).

By contrast, it was not recovered from extracts of cells treated with rVpr using \u03b1-ARNT1 (Figure 7D, upper panel, lane 12). Consistent results were obtained in a reverse experiment, in which WB using \u03b1-ARNT1 was performed on a sample recovered by IP using \u03b1-EGFP (Figure 7D, lower panel). In this case, the cell extract obtained after FICZ treatment yielded a positive signal (Figure 7D, lower panel, lane 10). These data suggest that the association between ORF1 and ARNT1 is induced by exogenous FICZ but not rVpr.",

We confirmed by in vitro experiments that rVpr did not increase expression of L1 mRNA or the splicing efficiency of an immature EGFP transcript derived from the reporter L1 construct (Additional file 15: Figure S13). Moreover, no apparent changes in the CpG methylation status were observed in the 5\u2032UTR of the exogenous hL1 gene in the kidneys of hL1-Tg mice that had been treated with rVpr (Additional file 8: Figure S6). Our data suggest that rVpr-induced L1-RTP is controlled at the post-transcriptional level, although it has been proposed that L1-RTP is influenced at the transcriptional level by the methylation status of the L1-5\u2032UTR [53,54].",

It has been shown that Vpr has an affinity for nucleic acids, which is attributable to the basic moiety in the C-terminal region of Vpr [55]. To exclude the possibility that the induction of AhR-dependent L1-RTP by Vpr depends on binding to nucleic acids, we investigated the interaction between Vpr and AhR after nuclease treatment. IP-WB analysis combined with treatment with benzonase, a nuclease that degrades both DNA and RNA, revealed that their interaction was not reduced (Additional file 17: Figure S15A). Additionally, ORF1 and AhR constitutively formed a complex, and their interaction was also resistant to nuclease treatment (Additional file 17: Figure S15B). Moreover, rVpr triggered chromatin recruitment of ORF1 in an AhR-dependent manner (Figure 7B). Taken together, these data suggest that Vpr functions as an AhR ligand, and activates a cellular cascade for the induction of L1-RTP.",

Interestingly, we previously examined blood Vpr by IP-WB analysis, and detected Vpr in 20 of 52 blood samples from HIV-1 patients [4]. Interestingly, the positive frequencies observed in these two sets of experiments are comparable, but greater numbers of samples are needed to conclude that blood Vpr is exclusively biologically active. Although it was reported that an antibody against Vpr is present in patients\u2019 blood [56], and implied that Vpr activity would be blocked by such autoantibodies, our current experiments proved that blood Vpr is active for the induction of L1-RTP.

Additionally, we found that Vpr also induced L1-RTP in the kidney (Figure 4A and Additional file 6: Table S2). Notably, even a single injection of 250 ng of rVpr into the tail vein induced L1-RTP in the kidneys (Figure 4A, right panels), suggesting that the kidney is a target organ of Vpr-induced L1-RTP. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Vpr induced L1-RTP in RTECs, especially in proximal RTECs (Figure 4D).

Additionally, it was shown that de-regulation of L1-RTP is positively linked to the development of autoimmune diseases [27]. Although these lines of evidence revealed that L1-RTP is induced in somatic cells and is involved in the development of human diseases, it remained unclear how L1-RTP is induced in somatic cells.

The present study is the first to show that L1-RTP-inducing activity is present in vivo, shedding light on the possible involvement of L1-RTP in human diseases. In further research, it will be important to detect L1-RTP-inducing activity under pathological conditions.",

Thus, occurrence of L1-RTP was determined by evaluating the size of the amplified product [28,29,37]. After staining of amplified DNA with SYBR Green I (LONZA, Basel, Switzerland), signal intensities of the 140 bp bands were measured using a molecular imager (FX-PRO; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized by the signal intensity of the \u03b2-actin band, used as the internal control.

After treatment of cells with rVpr (lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12) or FICZ (lanes 3, 4, 9 and 10), IP followed by WB were performed using \u03b1-ARNT1 and \u03b1-EGFP, respectively (upper panels). As a reverse experiment, IP using \u03b1-EGFP followed by WB using \u03b1-ARNT1 were performed (lower panels).
