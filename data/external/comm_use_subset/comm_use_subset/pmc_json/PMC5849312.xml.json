            "text": "Spontaneous periodic changes in the congestion state of the nasal mucosa associated with reciprocal fluctuations in nasal resistance to airflow are referred to as the nasal cycle. Cyclical shrinkage and dilation of the venous sinusoids distributed in the nasal mucosa contributes to the spontaneous alteration in nasal airflow [1\u20135]. This physiological phenomenon is present in 80% of normal human subjects and is also found in several animal species [5\u20139]. Although the function of the nasal cycle has not been clearly established, the cyclical changes in the congestion state of the nasal mucosa associated with nasal cycle may result in plasma extravasation and nasal fluid formation [3]. During the nasal cycles, one nasal cavity becomes more open, and its mucosal glands increase their secretion, while nasal mucosa in the opposite cavity becomes engorged, which diminishes mucosal gland secretion [10, 11]. Eccles proposed that the nasal cycle may have a role in respiratory defense by alternating air conditioning between the two nasal passage and by generating the nasal fluid [3]. Furthermore, nasal cycle are accompanied by change in dilation of the venous sinuses distributed in the nasal turbinate and nasal septum. The dilation state is controlled by the autonomic nervous system that regulates vasomotor activity of the nasal mucous membranes [9, 12]. It is believed that the action of the sympathetic nerve controlling reciprocal changes of nasal airflow is regulated by the vasomotor control areas of the medulla [13, 14]. The hypothalamus participates in regulation of the nasal cycle via the sympathetic nervous system distributed in the nasal mucosa [15].",

In normal subjects, a prominent circadian fluctuations in concentration of IgG, IgA, and albumin was revealed in nasal secretions [16, 17]. Circadian changes of the mucociliary transport times have also been shown [18]. Concentrations of albumin, elastase, and IL-8 in nasal lavage samples from healthy volunteers were significantly different between morning and afternoon [19]. The amount of collected nasal secretion was significantly higher at 6 a.m. than at 3 p.m. after a metacholine nasal challenge. Furthermore, numerous studies showed the diurnal manifestation and 24-h variation in the severity of allergic rhinitis [20, 21]. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis are relatively intense nocturnally, during sleep, and in the early morning [22]. A statistically higher concentration of inflammatory mediators was detected in the nasal secretions of allergic rhinitis patients after a challenge in the morning than in the afternoon. Such a circadian variation of nasal reactivity suggests that the ability to induce inflammatory activity in nasal mucosa depends on a circadian rhythm [23]. However, the regulator of these circadian rhythms at the molecular level has yet to be determined.",

The molecular analysis of the biological clock genes has revealed that a basic mechanism of the clock machinery composes the autoregulatory positive and negative feed-back loops of a set of clock genes [30, 31]. These feedback loops are composed of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1. These molecules dimerize, and activate transcription of the Period genes Per1 and Per2 [31\u201335]. Recent studies have revealed circadian variations in expression of clock genes in peripheral tissues, indicating that the analysis of clock gene expression profiles in peripheral tissues may provide useful clues for the elucidation of their individual circadian functions [24, 36, 37].",

Rhythmic expression patterns for PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 genes were observed for two consecutive days in the nasal mucosa of rat (Fig 3). Multiple peaks in PER1 mRNA levels in mucosa from the right nasal cavity appears at ZT3 and ZT12 (95% CI, cosinor, p<0.001) (Fig 3A). Then PER1 mRNA levels decreased at ZT24 before increasing again at ZT30 (95% CI, cosinor, p<0.001). In contrast, PER1 mRNA level in mucosa from the left nasal cavity was low until ZT18. Thereafter, its levels rose, showing a double peak at ZT27 and ZT36 (95% CI, cosinor, p < 0.001) (Fig 4A). PER2 mRNA levels in mucosa from the right nasal cavity peaked at ZT3 and ZT12 (95% CI, cosinor, p< 0.001) (Fig 3B), demonstrating a double peak, and then declined between ZT21 and ZT27. Double peaks also were found on the 2nd day at ZT33 and ZT39 (95% CI, cosinor, p<0.045) In mucosa from the left nasal cavity, PER2 mRNA level dynamics were opposite to those detected in right nasal cavity. CLOCK and BMAL1 mRNA levels in mucosa from the right and left nasal cavities showed peaks at ZT21 and ZT45 (95% CI, cosinor, p< 0.036), and then, their mucosal levels were reversed between both nasal mucosa, showing different expression levels between both nasal mucosa. The expression levels of PER1, PER2, and CLOCK genes were significantly different in mucosa from the right and left nasal cavities suggesting their asymmetrical expression levels in the two nasal cavities. However, although the mucosal expression levels of BMAL1 genes in the right and left nasal cavities were different during peak times, no statistical differences in BMAL1 expression were noted during the decreased circadian phase (Fig 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D). These antiphase expression patterns between PER1/PER2 and CLOCK/BMAL1 suggest that there is a functional peripheral circadian core oscillator in the nasal mucosa of rat. Furthermore, immunohistochemical experiments also showed that the expression of protein products of these genes was found in the respiratory mucosa of rat nasal cavity. In contrast to their expression patterns in the human nasal mucosa, Rat PER1 and PER2 proteins were predominantly distributed in the superficial epithelial layer and submucosal glands, whereas rat CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins were mainly localized to the vascular endothelium (Fig 4).",

Notably, PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 were asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities of normal control and allergic patients. The expression levels of these clock genes were higher in decongested mucosa than in congested mucosa in normal control and allergic rhinitis. Asymmetric expression of these four clock genes was also found in nasal mucosa derived from the left and right nasal cavities of rat, each clock gene showing a circadian rhythm. In rat nasal mucosa, PER1 and PER2 expression levels showed a robust rhythm and were accompanied by antiphase oscillations in CLOCK and BMAL1 levels. These findings provide evidence that a functional circadian clock is present in human and rat nasal mucosa, acting as distinct, circadian oscillators to set the circadian rhythm. Furthermore, the present results suggest the possibility that asymmetric expression of clock genes may be associated with the nasal cycle.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have reported that clock genes are expressed in peripheral human tissues or cells. Clock genes in those cell function as peripheral oscillators of the circadian rhythm, [41\u201346]. In this respect, the existence of a circadian clock within nasal mucosa was anticipated because numerous studies reported circadian variations in the pathophysiological functions of nasal mucosa. Although circadian variation in human biopsy samples could not be determined, expression levels of all clock genes tested in the present study were subject to robust circadian rhythms in rat nasal mucosa under light-dark cycle conditions. Based on these results, we conclude that clock genes are expressed in human and rat nasal mucosa. Moreover, a circadian rhythm in nasal mucosa is likely to function independently of the central clock distributed in the brain. Our results are consistent with previous results that showed significant circadian variation in the levels of PER1 and PER2 mRNA in mouse nasal mucosa, where PER2 was localized to the epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and nerve termini [47]. In the present study, the cellular localization of the four clock proteins was different in human and rat nasal mucosa. In human nasal mucosa, positive immunoreactivity of four clock genes was mainly detected in the superficial epithelium, submucosal glands, and vascular endothelial cells. However, in rat nasal mucosa, strong immunoreactivity of PER1 and PER2 was mainly observed in the superficial epithelium and in a small number of submucosal glands, whereas the vascular endothelium was only lightly stained. In contrast, CLOCK and BMAL1 were mainly localized to the vascular endothelium. Based on their characteristic localization pattern, we hypothesized that these clock genes may play their divergent roles in the physiological function of human and rat nasal mucosa. Because clock proteins in human nasal mucosa were identified in the superficial epithelium, submucosal gland, and vascular endothelium, it is conceivable that their expression might be involved in circadian rhythm of mucosal function such as nasal secretion and blood supply of microvasculature. In rat nasal mucosa, PER1 and PER2 might be involved in secretory function, whereas CLOCK and BMAL1 genes might regulate blood supply. Further studies are warranted to determine whether there is clock gene-mediated interplay between blood flow and secretion.",

            "text": "It has been generally accepted that cyclical changes in nasal airway resistance are caused by autonomic tone that regulates blood supply to the mucosal vessels and is under the control of a hypothalamic center [15]. Nevertheless, the control process underlying the nasal cycle is not fully understood. Interestingly, we found that there are significant differences in the expression levels of clock genes in nasal mucosa in both human nasal cavities. The expression levels of these clock genes in decongested mucosa were higher than in congested mucosa. These results show that clock genes may possibly be involved in the nasal cycle of congestion and decongestion of the nasal mucosa. Similar findings were also noted in nasal mucosa of rat. It has been demonstrated previously that vessels in nasal mucosa are divided into resistance vessels and capacitance vessels [48]. The resistance vessels are composed of small arteries, veins and arterio-venous anastomosis. Especially, arterio-venous anastomosis, controlled by the autonomic nervous system, regulates nasal mucosa blood flow by alternating smooth muscle tone. In contrast, the major capacitance vessels in nasal mucosa are composed of vascular sinusoid, and its swelling is mainly affected by nasal mucosa blood flow and filling pressure. The volume of blood flow in nasal mucosa affects nasal resistance, and the dilation of vascular sinusoid can result in nasal congestion, contributing to nasal obstruction [49\u201353]. The existence of a circadian rhythm in the function of blood vessels has long been recognized. The clock genes are ubiquitously expressed and exhibit rhythmic expression in blood vessels. Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that these 24-h timers exerts a significant influence on the vasculature, whereby disruption of circadian clock components results in vascular stiffness and altered endothelial progenitor cell function [54]. Moreover, mutations of clock genes have been reported to have detrimental effects on the vascular function in mice [55]. Mice deficient in BMAL1 and CLOCK genes showed a reduced vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and had impaired endothelial function [56]. Selective deletion of BMAL1 from smooth muscle attenuated the circadian rhythm of blood pressure [57]. In this respect, we hypothesize that clock genes involved in the control of blood flow may contribute to the regulation of the nasal cycle. More studies are required to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of clock gene functions in cyclical congestion and decongestion of nasal mucosa.",

            "text": "Significant changes in the circadian amplitude of clock gene expression has been shown to cause cellular dysfunction and chronic diseases [58, 59]. The expression levels of clock proteins such as BMAL1 and PER2 are reduced in inflamed lung tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [60]. Viral respiratory infection in the lung induced molecular clock dysfunction and increase mortality in BMAL1 knockout mice, suggesting that altered clock function impairs the immune response [61]. Circadian alterations in expression levels of CLOCK, CRY1, and PER2 mRNA were found in schizophrenia [62]. The expression levels of BMAL1 and PER1 are normally in antiphase with each other, as demonstrated, for example, in the synovial membrane samples obtained from patients with osteoarthritis, where high BMAL1 expression coexisted with low PER1 expression. This expression pattern is commonly found in all clock works in the body [26]. However, this antiphase phenomenon was not found in rheumatoid arthritis patients. These results indicate that the clock is dysfunctional in rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that inflammation may disturb circadian time-keeping [63]. In this respect, although the relationships between allergic rhinitis and clock genes functions remains unclear, we hypothesized that clock genes expression levels might be altered in allergic nasal mucosa in comparison with their levels in normal nasal mucosa. However, no significant differences in the expression levels of PER1, PER2, CLOCK, and BMAL1 in human control and allergic nasal mucosa samples were noted in the present study. In a recent study, the expression pattern of clock genes showed a clear circadian rhythm with a peak at ZT13 in both control and asthmatic mice. No significant differences in the daily rhythmic pattern of PER1 and PER2 expression were observed in control and OVA-treated mice [64], which suggests that allergic responses in the lung may not interact with clock functions.",

For example, passive cutaneous and systemic anaphylactic reactions were observed in wild-type, but not in PER2-mutant mice [65]. These reactions were also absent in mice with mechanical disruption of the central SCN clock [66]. Ear swelling, serum IgE levels, and the number of mast cells were significantly increased in Clock mutant mice, providing evidence that CLOCK mutation induces the T-helper type 2 immune response and aggravates contact hypersensitivity in skin [67]. Bone marrow-derived basophils in wild-type mice exhibited circadian variation in IgE-mediated IL-4 and histamine production, which was not observed in bone marrow-derived basophils of mice bearing a mutation in the CLOCK gene [68]. Therefore, functional analyses of resident cells including nasal epithelial cells or inflammatory cells infiltrated into nasal mucosa in clock genes mutant mice are further required.",

In human nasal mucosa, the expression of MUC5AC is higher in the decongested side than in congested side. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm associated with different expression levels in the right and left nasal cavities. Expression levels of PER1 and PER2 was the highest at ZT3 and ZT12 on the right side and at ZT27 and ZT36 on the left side. MUC5AC levels was the highest at ZT3, ZT9, and ZT21 on the right side and at ZT27 and ZT33 on the left side. However, the expression levels of aquporin5 were not different between the two nasal cavities in human and rat nasal mucosa and exhibit a lower amplitude oscillation. These findings suggests that both MUC5AC and aquaporin5 production are modified by circadian change, but aquaporin5 oscillates with a lower amplitude. It is known that muscarinic M1, M2, M3 receptors are expressed in nasal mucosa [69, 70]. Because muscarinic receptors in the mouse lung show a circadian rhythm in their expression levels, and because in nasal mucosa, muscarinic type 3 receptors participate in mucin secretion [70, 71], it is speculated that the circadian regulation of MUC5AC secretion is controlled by the muscarinic receptors. Nevertheless, further experiments are needed to assess the circadian regulation of mucin secretion.",
