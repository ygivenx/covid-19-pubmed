            "text": "The prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) is known to vary significantly based upon geography and ethnicity, with ranges from 0.5 to 6 in 1,000 newborns [1]. The mothers of an NTD-affected child are 10-fold more likely to give birth to a second child with an NTD, suggesting the involvement of both environmental and genetic factors in their etiology. There are multiple types of isolated NTDs including spina bifida and anencephaly [2]. Current prenatal screening efforts are based on two complementary methods, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and ultrasound screening. It has been determined that in a fetus with an NTD, exposed membranes allow AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and then into maternal serum, at a level of roughly in proportion to the size of the exposed area. However, the level of MSAFP is not a specific indicator of an NTD, since it is also increased in ventral wall defects (omphalocele or gastroschisis), abnormal glomerular diseases such as nephrotic syndrome, defective placental membranes (fetal hydrops), and fetal blood contamination due to a traumatic amniocentesis, as well as other pregnancy-related problems [1]. Although a matter of some controversy, when the spina bifida lesion is covered with healthy skin, MSAFP and amniotic fluid AFP (AFAFP) concentrations are generally found to be normal. Therefore, due to the low specificity of MSAFP or AFAFP levels, its use as a screening tool, has limited diagnostic value. Norem and coworkers found that among the 102 NTDs cases who had received MSAFP testing, 25 cases (25%) had negative maternal serum screening results, including 15 (38%) of the 40 spina bifida cases tested, 6 (67%) of the 9 encephalocele cases tested, and 4 (8%) of the 53 anencephaly cases [3]. At present, there does not appear to be a more specific marker of NTDs that has been identified in maternal serum [1]. Kooper et al. found that 27 out of 6,188 pregnancies (0.4%) without any increased NTD risk had AFAFP levels >2.5 MoM (multiples of the median), two of which were associated with NTDs; two out of 258 pregnancies (0.8%) with an increased NTD risk had elevated AFAFP levels and were associated with affected pregnancies; and 44 of 55 pregnancies (80%) with clinically diagnosed fetal NTDs had an increased AFAFP levels [2].",

When the fetus has an NTD, acetylcholinesterase is present as a rapidly-migrating eletrophoretic band, in addition to butyrylcholinesterase. However, amniocentesis is an invasive procedure, and it has not been used routinely in the clinical practice.",

SELDI-TOF-MS detects proteins selectively adsorbed onto the surface of a protein chip array after non-specifically bound proteins are washed off by stringent buffers, and has been shown to be sensitive, rapid and reliable. This technique has been successfully applied in the discovery of serum biomarkers for many cancers [5]\u2013[18], nervous system diseases [19]\u2013[22] and renal diseases [23]\u2013[32].

All of the normal control mothers, which had no pregnancy-related problems, such as diabetes or hypertension, had or were carrying fetuses lacking any congenital defects. All of the normal control mothers had normal biochemistry detection of serum and urine. Control amniotic fluid samples were collected from pregnant women with a normal fetal karyotype. Karyotypes of all fetuses were evaluated following amniocentesis. Prenatal diagnoses of NTD-affected and normal fetuses were confirmed using ultrasonography.

MSAFP screening and ultrasonography are both used for prenatally detecting NTD-affected fetuses. Although The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended that all pregnant women should be offered MSAFP screening in the second trimester of pregnancy, the detection rate for NTDs using elevated MSAFP level as a screening tool was only 75% to 80% [3]. Causes for elevated MSAFP levels other than NTDs include underestimated gestational age, congenital skin defects, pilonidal cysts, abdominal wall defects, gastrointestinal defects, obstruction, liver necrosis, cloacal exstrophy, cystic hygroma, sacrococcygeal teratoma, renal anomalies, urinary obstruction, polycystic kidney, absent kidney, congenital nephrosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, low birth weight, oligohydramnios, multiple gestation and maternal underweight [38]. Szajkowski et al. suggested that MSAFP screening had a low sensitivity for fetal hydrocephalus and was rarely elevated in isolated cases [39]. Screening for NTD is now a routine prenatal test, mainly due to its association with second-trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome determined by combination of low AFP value and high hCG value. AFAFP can also be used as an indicator for NTDs, but its specificity is not satisfactory [1], and sensitivity is 80% [2]. Therefore, the suggestion of performing routine AFAFP test in early second-trimester genetic amniocentesis by Widlund et al. [40] to rule out the possibility of an open fetal NTD, does not seem to be justified given its limited clinical diagnostic value. Electrophoresis of amniotic fluid cholinesterases can also be used to biochemical diagnose of NTDs, which has good sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value [4]. However, as an invasive technique, amniocentesis might cause abortion, infection, injury to mother and fetus, which must all be weighed against the value of performing the test.",

There were a greater number of different proteins in the serum samples than the amniotic fluid samples, when the amniotic fluid is more directly measuring fetal proteins than maternal serum. However, when we analyzed the data, we found that only four protein/peptide biomarkers, 4188, 6451, 11744 and 23425 Da, were detected in all serum, urine and amniotic fluid samples. One possible explanation is that these four protein/peptide biomarkers might be related to the abnormal protein expression of NTDs. Since identification of these biomarkers is essential for understanding their biological roles in NTDs, we are currently making efforts to characterize these protein/peptide biomarkers. The ultimate clinical application of protein profiling is for the early detection of NTDs from the maternal body fluid, such as serum or urine. Detection of larger number of peaks in serum samples than those of urine and amniotic fluid samples suggested that the identification of candidate biomarkers from maternal serum samples may be productive.",

            "text": "It was noted that not all differentially expressed protein peaks were used in the CART analysis. Wadsworth et al. suggested that CART analysis should examine all possible protein peak combinations in input spectral data to generate the best classification tree, in which any statistically insignificant protein peak included was also important for the classification algorithm after stratification [43]. Although peak of 7788 Da shown in Figure 5 had no statistical difference between the two groups of serum, it was crucial for the classification tree to delineate subsets of groups that had been stratified by the significant peak of 4105 Da. The use of peak of 8244 Da in the urine sample CART shown in Figure 6 was similar with that of peak of 7788 Da in the serum sample CART. According to literature, another research group has used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE)/mass spectrometry (MS) to characterize differentially expressed proteins in amniotic-fluid samples (AFSs) of embryonic day (E) 17.5 rat fetuses with spina bifida aperta induced by retinoic acid (RA) [44]. They identified five proteins differentially expressed in AFSs of spina bifida aperta, including three upregulated proteins (transferrin, alpha-1 antiproteinase and signal recognition particle receptor, B subunit [SRPRB] 55 kDa), two downregulated proteins. Specifically, they found 11 alpha-1 fetoprotein (AFP) fragments that were downregulated and 35 AFP fragments that were upregulated in AFSs from embryos with spina bifida aperta. The comparative proteomic study of AFSs from rat fetuses with spina bifida aperta may provide new insights in neural tube defects and contribute to the prenatal screening.",

            "text": "This study suggests that NTDs-specific proteomic signatures are likely to present in serum, urine, and amniotic fluid of mothers carrying a NTDs fetus. It is reported that at present although AFP screening detects 88% of affected fetuses with a false positive rate of 3% in the second trimester, ultrasound has 100% specificity and 98% sensitivity for NTD at 18\u201320 week [45], [46]. Currently, it is still controversial whether or not it is sufficient to rely only on ultrasound to detect NTD. Recent literature has even suggested only ultrasound be used. New techniques in ultrasound have high specificity and sensitivity [47]. In the paper, there is a recommendation to abolish MSAP and rely only on ultrasound (which approaches 100% specificity and sensitivity). However, on the other hand, some recent studies also demonstrated the limitation of ultrasound approach alone to detect NTD. For example, one study showed that ultrasound biparietal diameter alone would detect 50% of cases for a 5% false-positive rate or 63% for 10%; adding AFP increases detection by 2%; and a combined test with Ultrasound biparietal diameter, AFP, and free b-hCG detects 58% for 5% or 70% for 10% [48]. Another study indicated that there were 20 perinatal deaths from NTD using ultrasound approach alone that could potentially have been prevented through the use of pre-conceptual folate [49]. Therefore, in New Zealand, new guidelines were implemented in 2010 that required all eligible pregnant women to be offered a nuchal translucency scan combined with a blood test to improve NTD detection. In our study, we could only take samples from those pregnant women who have already been diagnosed with NTD-affected pregnancies by prenatal ultrasound. If ultrasound is not sufficient enough for NTD in some cases, we think, SELDI-TOF-MS can at least serve as an additional method for NTDs pregnancy detection because of its relatively high sensitivity and specificity. Our pilot study demonstrated the application of SELDI protein profiling in the detection of mothers with NTD-affected fetuses. We have preliminarily established a relatively specific procedure to detect NTD-affected pregnancies using a combination of ProteinChip technology and Classification and Regression Tree Analysis.",
