Successful dissemination of many of these pathogens requires complex life cycles that involve survival and replication in environmental or vector niches. To propagate within their hosts, these pathogens establish a variety of unique intracellular niches that are essential for their pathogenesis [1]. Although there is considerable understanding of how intracellular pathogens manipulate host cell biology to promote their pathogenesis, less is known about the precise mechanisms by which these pathogens sense their host cell. Such an understanding may lead to targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study we used Listeria monocytogenes as a model system for understanding virulence gene regulation of a facultative intracellular bacterium that transitions from extracellular to intracellular growth.",

L. monocytogenes is also a model system for studying bacterial adaptation to the host [3]. The bacterial virulence program is coordinated with a life cycle that begins upon entry into a mammalian cell either by phagocytosis or bacteria-mediated internalization. To commence intracellular growth, L. monocytogenes must first escape from the hostile phagosomal environment by the expression and secretion of a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO) that mediates destruction of the phagosome [4]. Upon entry into the cytosol, L. monocytogenes grows rapidly and expresses an essential determinant of pathogenesis, ActA, an abundant surface protein that mediates host actin polymerization [5,6]. Appropriate regulation of LLO and ActA is critical for L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and transcriptionally coordinated by the master virulence regulator PrfA [7].",

            "text": "PrfA is a cAMP receptor protein (Crp) family transcriptional regulator that is absolutely essential for L. monocytogenes virulence gene expression and pathogenesis [8]. PrfA-mediated gene expression is regulated by PrfA abundance, affinity for target promoters, and activation via cofactor binding [9]. PrfA levels are controlled by three promoters. The most proximal promoter contains a site of negative regulation, while the most distal is a PrfA-dependent read-through transcript that is essential for appropriately high levels of intracellular gene expression [10\u201312]. PrfA binds a palindromic DNA sequence (PrfA-box) and deviations from a consensus sequence result in lower affinity DNA-PrfA interactions [13]. The affinity of PrfA for DNA determines the degree of transcriptional activation prior to PrfA allosteric activation [14]. For example, the gene encoding LLO (hly) has a high affinity PrfA-box and consequently is expressed even during growth in broth when PrfA is not activated. In contrast, the actA promoter contains a lower affinity PrfA box and is not expressed during growth in broth [15,16]. Upon entry into the host cell cytosol, PrfA is over-expressed and is activated by a two-step process: first, binding of PrfA to DNA requires reduction of the four PrfA cysteine residues while full transcriptional activation of PrfA requires allosteric binding to glutathione [17]. The requirement for glutathione can be bypassed by mutations that lock PrfA in its active conformation (PrfA*) [18]. Strains with PrfA* mutations constitutively express PrfA-activated genes and consequently have growth defects extracellularly, demonstrating the importance of regulating virulence gene expression [19,20]. However, even PrfA* strains grown in broth fail to synthesize the amount of ActA observed intracellularly, which is likely attributable to translational control localized to the 5\u2019 untranslated region (5\u2019 UTR) [21]. Despite these findings of exquisite gene regulation, little is known about trans-acting factors that affect expression of PrfA or PrfA-activated genes.",

This screen led to the identification of L. monocytogenes glutathione synthase (GshF) and glutathione, a tripeptide antioxidant, as the allosteric activator of PrfA. In this study we sought to further understand the host cues that are recognized by intracellular pathogens during infection. We returned to the forward genetic selection and exhaustively screened for additional mutants that failed to express sufficient ActA intracellularly. This selection identified genes required at each stage of the intracellular lifecycle, including: vacuolar escape, PrfA activation, and cell-to-cell spread. These data suggest a model of compartmentalized gene expression, furthering our understanding of the L. monocytogenes virulence program.",

This \u2018suicide\u2019 strain harbored loxP sites in the chromosome flanking the origin of replication (ori) and several essential genes. Codon-optimized cre recombinase was expressed from the actA promoter (Fig 1A). The suicide strain grew like wild type in rich media but was unrecoverable after infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). A himar1 transposon library was then constructed in the suicide strain background and used to infect BMMs. When bacteria were isolated at five hours post-infection (p.i.) nearly all mutants harbored transposon insertions in cre, the actA promoter driving cre expression (actA1p), loxP sites, and gshF, encoding glutathione synthase. To identify additional genes required during infection, colonies were isolated at three and four hours p.i, generating a library of 1,090 transposon mutants from an initial inoculum of >1 million bacteria. Colony PCR excluded strains with transposon insertions in cre and gshF, resulting in a collection of ~700 strains (Fig 1A).",

Saturation of the screen was further demonstrated after identification of 11 insertions in the actA promoter driving cre and 31 insertions in the loxP sites (which are each only 34 nucleotides). The remaining transposon mutations were transduced into a wild type background and analyzed in a plaque assay, a highly sensitive measure of cell-to-cell spread, which is completely dependent on actA expression [22]. Using a threshold of 85%, 12 mutants were identified that formed plaques significantly smaller than wild type in L2 murine fibroblasts (Fig 2A and Table 1). With one exception, the transposon insertions were in open reading frames and likely resulted in loss-of-function mutations. The transposon in the promoter of lmo2191 (spxA1), a gene predicted to be essential in L. monocytogenes [23], resulted in a 10-fold decrease in spxA1 expression when the bacteria were grown in broth, essentially resulting in a knock-down strain (S1 Fig). Attempts to make an in-frame deletion of spxA1 using conventional methods were unsuccessful, consistent with a previous report [23].",

It was surprising that four mutants exhibited impaired plaque formation yet were fully virulent; it is possible that these four mutants are impaired in other aspects of pathogenesis not reflected by changes in CFU during these infection conditions. To determine if the plaque defects in these mutants were due to cell-specific defects evident only in the L2 murine fibroblasts used for plaque assays, cell-to-cell spread defects were also analyzed in TIB-73 cells, a murine hepatocyte cell line (Table 1). We observed consistent phenotypes between the plaque defects in TIB-73 cells and L2 cells with the exception of citC::Tn, P-spxA1::Tn, and ohrA::Tn. However, these mutants were significantly attenuated during infection and thus it was unclear why they did not display a plaque defect in TIB-73 cells.",

            "text": "In this study we focused on the following genes that were required for actA expression and pathogenesis (Fig 1B). yjbH (lmo0964) encodes a putative thioredoxin similar to YjbH in Bacillus subtilis (57% amino acid similarity) [28]. A transposon in L. monocytogenes yjbH was previously identified in a screen for mutants defective in LLO production in vitro and was found to be attenuated in a competitive infection model [29]. spxA1 (lmo2191) encodes an ArsC family transcriptional regulator similar to the disulfide stress regulator Spx conserved in Firmicutes (83% amino acid identity to B. subtilis Spx) [30]. The difference in nomenclature is due to the presence of a paralogous gene in L. monocytogenes (lmo2426 or spxA2) that is 59% identical to B. subtilis Spx while B. subtilis encodes only a single spx. In B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus YjbH post-translationally regulates Spx [28,31], although it is not known if this function is conserved in L. monocytogenes. lmo2199 encodes a hypothetical protein with a peroxiredoxin domain and is part of the organic hydroperoxide resistance (Ohr) protein subfamily. It is co-transcribed with lmo2200, encoding a MarR family transcriptional regulator which was not required for virulence, suggesting that Lmo2200 may act as a transcriptional repressor [26]. In B. subtilis homologs of Lmo2199 and Lmo2200 are named OhrA (63% amino acid similarity) and OhrR (68%), respectively, and we have adopted this nomenclature for consistency [32]. arpJ (lmo2250) encodes a predicted amino acid ABC transporter permease that was originally identified in a screen for genes with increased intracellular expression [25]. However, the data presented here did not show an increase in arpJ expression during infection of BMMs. This may be explained by the different growth media and cell types used in the two studies. It is also possible that arpJ is autoregulated, as the previous study analyzed arpJ expression in an arpJ transposon mutant. pplA (lmo2637) encodes a lipoprotein whose secretion is increased in a PrfA* mutant [33]. The signal sequence of this lipoprotein is processed into a secreted peptide, which is required for vacuolar escape from non-phagocytic cells [24]. Finally, gshF (lmo2770) encodes the only glutathione synthase in L. monocytogenes [34]. Glutathione has been demonstrated to be an allosteric activator of PrfA and therefore gshF mutants are severely attenuated in vivo due to insufficient virulence gene expression [17].",

Accordingly, we screened for mutations that increased the virulence of a \u0394gshF mutant. Mice were serially infected with a high-inoculum of \u0394gshF, livers were harvested at 72 hours p.i., homogenized, and diluted to inoculate naive mice. After four successive infections bacteria isolated from infected livers were analyzed by plaque assay. This approach previously identified a mutation in prfA that constitutively activates the protein (G145S), known as PrfA*, completely bypassing the requirement for glutathione during infection [17]. The \u0394gshF PrfA* suppressor forms 100% plaque; therefore, for these experiments we selected bacteria that formed intermediate-sized plaques, which were then subjected to genome sequencing. Two suppressor mutants were isolated and found to encode a G>A mutation 58 nucleotides 5\u2019 of the prfA start codon (Fig 3A). This mutation lies within a previously identified site of negative regulation of prfA, the so-called \u201cP2 promoter\u201d (prfA2p, Fig 3A) and deletion of the -35 region of this promoter (\u0394P2 mutant) results in a 10-20-fold up-regulation of the prfA1p-dependent prfA transcript [11]. We hypothesized that the prfA -58 G>A mutation also inactivated the P2 promoter and resulted in greater PrfA abundance. Indeed, the \u0394P2 gshF::Tn double mutant and the \u0394gshF prfA -58 G>A suppressor mutants all formed plaques approximately 60% the size of wild type (Fig 3B). These results did not directly implicate any of the other genes identified in our genetic selection, however these findings did highlight the impact of both PrfA abundance and activation during infection.",

Strains expressing \u0394P2 or PrfA* decouple PrfA abundance and activation whereby \u0394P2 increases PrfA abundance but still relies on glutathione for PrfA activation; PrfA* increases both the amount and activity of PrfA, independent of glutathione. We next sought to determine if the other mutants identified in the screen affected PrfA abundance or activation by transducing each into L. monocytogenes \u0394P2 and PrfA* backgrounds and measuring the plaque size in each background (Fig 3C). Based on these analyses, mutants fell into three categories. The first category (yjbH::Tn, P-spxA1::Tn, ohrA::Tn, and arpJ::Tn) was unaffected by alterations in PrfA expression or activity, indicating that these genes were required down-stream of PrfA. In the second category was gshF::Tn, which was partially rescued by \u0394P2 and completely rescued by PrfA*, consistent with the demonstrated role for glutathione as the allosteric activator of PrfA. The third category describes pplA::Tn, which formed 100% plaques in both the \u0394P2 and PrfA* backgrounds. These data suggested that the pplA mutant was capable of activating PrfA (because it was rescued by \u0394P2) but was deficient in expression of PrfA-dependent genes required early during infection before cytosolic access and glutathione-mediated activation of PrfA.",

            "text": "A principle difference between early and late PrfA-dependent genes is that expression of early genes are less dependent on PrfA activation by glutathione [35]. The two early genes are hly (encoding LLO) and plcA, which share a high-affinity PrfA-box and are transcribed by unactivated PrfA [35,36]. The \u0394P2 mutation results in increased transcription of early genes but does not affect late gene expression, whereas PrfA* increases transcription of both early and late genes. We hypothesized that strains rescued by \u0394P2 are specifically deficient in early gene expression. Accordingly, we analyzed early gene expression (LLO production) in broth for each mutant. Several of the mutants were found to secrete less LLO than wild type (Fig 4A). To determine if the defect in LLO production led to impaired phagosomal escape and thus a plaque defect, these mutations were transduced into a \u0394hly mutant over-expressing hly from a constitutive HyPer promoter (pH-hly strain) [37,38]. In this background, efficiency of vacuolar escape should be equivalent in all strains, and indeed, equal LLO secretion was confirmed in broth. Constitutive expression of hly rescued the plaque defects of three mutants: P-spxA1::Tn, ohrA::Tn, and pplA::Tn (Fig 4B). Interestingly, there was discordance between LLO production in broth and the defect in plaque formation one might predict from an LLO deficiency. For this reason, measuring LLO production in broth may be revealing aspects of bacterial physiology unrelated to LLO production in vivo.",

Constitutive expression of hly would likely overcome either defect. We attempted to segregate these two possibilities by analyzing sensitivity to vacuolar conditions, including reactive oxygen species which L. monocytogenes must adapt to in order to survive [39,40]. The response of each mutant to peroxide, disulfide stress, and organic hydroperoxide was analyzed by measuring their sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), diamide, and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), respectively. Knock-down of spxA1 and disruption of ohrA or gshF significantly increased the sensitivity of L. monocytogenes to both peroxide and disulfide stress (Fig 4C). In accordance with its annotation and the published role of ohrA in B. subtilis [32], the ohrA::Tn mutant was significantly more susceptible to CHP (Fig 4C). As these results suggested a role for redox control of virulence genes, we tested the hypothesis that host reactive oxygen or nitrogen species may be sensed by the bacteria during infection to activate actA. However, growth of the suicide mutant was not rescued in BMMs lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2\n-/-) or NADPH oxidase (NOX2\n-/-) (S3 Fig). Therefore, L. monocytogenes may activate virulence genes in response to multiple redundant host cues or depend on yet unidentified host pathways.",

In fact, P-spxA1::Tn and ohrA::Tn were also the only mutants that exhibited growth defects in rich media (Fig 4E).

Together, these data suggested that yjbH was required for actA expression post-transcriptionally. Indeed, transcript levels of actA were identical in BMMs infected with wild type or the \u0394yjbH mutant (Fig 5B). It is intriguing that arpJ::Tn was epistatic to gshF, yet not rescued by constitutive activation of PrfA, indicating that arpJ may contribute to glutathione-dependent transcriptional activation of actA through an unknown mechanism.",

A strain was constructed in which ActA was expressed independent of PrfA by expressing the entire actA transcript (including the 5\u2019 UTR) under the control of the constitutive HyPer promoter in a strain deleted for actA (pH-actA Strain, Fig 5D). ActA protein abundance was then analyzed by immunoblot. In this background, ActA abundance was equivalent among all strains when the bacteria were grown in broth (Fig 5E). However, during infection of BMMs, disruption of yjbH resulted in significant impairment in ActA abundance (Fig 5F), indicating a failure to translationally activate actA. Given that disrupting yjbH rescued the death of the suicide strain in which cre was expressed under actA1p and the 5' UTR, these data indicate a genetic interaction between yjbH and the 5\u2019 UTR of actA. To further support this genetic interaction we engineered a fluorescent strain of L. monocytogenes in which rfp was expressed under the actA1p promoter and 5' UTR (actA1p-rfp, Fig 5G). During infection of BMMs the \u0394yjbH actA1p-rfp strain exhibited significantly less fluorescence than wild type actA1p-rfp (Fig 5H). Unfortunately, we were unable to interrogate the effect of a yjbH mutation on ActA abundance in the absence of its 5\u2019 UTR due to an inability to detect ActA when the 5\u2019 UTR was deleted, consistent with this region being critical for ActA expression [21].",

This strain was called actA1p and was only mildly impaired in plaque formation and virulence (Fig 5I and 5J). However, actA1p yjbH::Tn was unable to form a plaque (Fig 5I). The importance of actA translational activation was further underscored by a 3-log defect for actA1p yjbH::Tn in the livers of infected mice (Fig 5J). These data revealed a critical role for yjbH in actA activation that was less apparent in the wild type background due to redundant PrfA-dependent promoters.",

Mutants identified in the genetic selection fell into three broad categories: (1) those that failed to reach the cytosolic compartment; (2) mutants that entered the cytosol, but failed to activate the master virulence transcriptional regulator PrfA; and (3) mutants that entered the cytosol and activated transcription of actA, but failed to synthesize it (Fig 6). This approach highlighted how expression of virulence factors is spatially and temporally compartmentalized via regulation of transcription and translation during infection. One of the most striking findings of this study was that the majority of genes identified in the selection encode proteins predicted to control bacterial redox regulation, suggesting that redox changes represent one of the biological cues sensed by L. monocytogenes to regulate its virulence program. Redox stress during infection can arise from endogenous by-products of bacterial metabolism and exogenously derived factors generated by the host. However, it remains to be discovered whether the redox stress that may trigger virulence gene expression is produced by the host, the bacteria, or both.",

In B. subtilis OhrA is a peroxiredoxin required during organic hydroperoxide stress [32]. In S. aureus and B. subtilis YjbH interacts with Spx to regulate the abundance and activity of Spx [28,31]. Specifically, YjbH-bound Spx is recognized by the ClpXP protease and is degraded so that Spx concentrations are low under steady-state conditions [42,43]. During disulfide stress the YjbH:Spx interaction is disrupted by intramolecular disulfide bonds in both proteins that result in reduced proteolysis of Spx. B. subtilis Spx represses transcription of 176 genes and activates transcription of 106 genes [44], the majority of which are required to adapt to redox stress, including genes for production of the low-molecular weight (LMW) thiol utilized by B. subtilis, bacillithiol [45]. L. monocytogenes spxA1 cannot be deleted and its regulon has not yet been characterized [23]. Similarly, in Streptococcus pneumoniae simultaneous deletion of both spxA1 and spxA2 paralogues is lethal [46], supporting the notion that the Spx regulon(s) may contain essential genes in some Firmicutes.",

Glutathione is a tripeptide LMW thiol antioxidant present at millimolar concentrations that contributes to maintaining a reducing environment in both bacterial and host cells [47]. Not surprisingly, L. monocytogenes \u0394gshF mutants are more sensitive to redox stressors such as hydrogen peroxide and diamide and are 200-fold less virulent in mice, indicating that bacterially-derived glutathione is essential for pathogenesis [17]. However, \u0394gshF mutants are fully virulent in L. monocytogenes harboring prfA* mutations that lock PrfA in its constitutively active conformation. Therefore, the primary role of GshF-derived glutathione during infection is to activate virulence gene expression via PrfA activation, although we cannot rule out a contribution of imported host-derived glutathione [17]. Indeed, host-derived glutathione activates virulence gene expression in Burkholderia pseudomallei [48]. In the case of L. monocytogenes, gshF is transcriptionally up-regulated 10-fold during intracellular growth, suggesting the existence of an unidentified cue, likely redox-related, that stimulates glutathione production.",

Redox stress during infection could arise from host-derived antimicrobial factors. For example, the host generates antibacterial factors that assault invading pathogens with redox stresses, including: reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive electrophilic species (RES) such as methylglyoxal, and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide and peroxynitrite [40,49,50]. Interestingly, these redox stresses from the host are spatially compartmentalized. RNS and ROS are produced in the phagosome and once in the host cytosol, L. monocytogenes is confronted with RES and mitochondrial-derived ROS [40,51]. It is possible that the bacterial response to the redox stressors is also compartmentalized, requiring specific factors in the vacuole (such as spxA1 and ohrA) and host cytosol (such as yjbH).",

            "text": "Alternatively, the source of redox stress may come from bacterial metabolism via ROS generated from incomplete reduction of oxygen during aerobic respiration [53]. Carbon source and phosphate abundance also affect the production of ROS and methylglyoxal [54,55]. PrfA activity has been demonstrated to be sensitive to available carbon sources [2]. Growth on plant-derived beta-glucoside sugars in the environment, such as cellobiose, represses PrfA activation, whereas growth on host-derived sugars such as glucose-1-phosphate stimulates PrfA-dependent gene expression [9,56,57]. Therefore, entry of L. monocytogenes into the host cytosol results in a remodeling of carbon metabolism that may be linked to virulence gene regulation. Glycerol is the principle carbon source used by L. monocytogenes intracellularly and growth on glycerol is a well-described stimulant of methylglyoxal production [58\u201361]. In B. subtilis, methylglyoxal stress stimulates the Spx regulon and production of bacillithiol, a low molecular weight thiol used by B. subtilis to detoxify methylglyoxal [62]. Thus, the 10-fold increase in gshF transcript levels in L. monocytogenes may correspond to increased methylglyoxal production during infection, which would further link metabolism of an alternative carbon source to virulence. Coupling of metabolism to virulence gene regulation may allow the system to remain OFF in the environment while remaining poised to turn ON upon entering a host. Considering our finding of multiple redox factors that are required for proper virulence gene expression, we speculate that changes in carbon metabolism could alter the endogenous levels of ROS and RES produced, thus affecting PrfA activation and leading to the \u201csugar-mediated repression\u201d observed previously [9].",

The data reported here further emphasize the sensitivity of actA translation to the environment in which L. monocytogenes is growing. In broth, the PrfA* strain elaborated 2.4% the amount of ActA protein as compared to constitutively expressed actA (Fig 5E), and increased 200-fold during infection (Fig 5F), despite the fact that transcript levels of actA are equivalent in both growth conditions [17]. These data emphasize the importance of the translational control of this virulence factor. Importantly, yjbH was required for the increased abundance of ActA protein during infection. In wild type L. monocytogenes, multiple PrfA-dependent promoters may compensate for loss of translational activation; however, when actA was isolated under its most proximal promoter, disruption of yjbH resulted in an attenuation of over 3-logs in the livers of infected animals (Fig 5J). It seems unlikely that the thioredoxin YjbH activates translation of actA via direct binding to the 5\u2019 UTR. However, YjbH may indirectly activate translation via interaction with another factor(s) or modulation of a small-molecule signal produced by the host.",

The complexity of actA activation is likely the result of selective pressure to respond appropriately to host-derived cues. This study investigated the virulence defects associated with failure to up-regulate virulence genes; however, over-production or inappropriate regulation of virulence factors extracellularly also results in a competitive disadvantage for L. monocytogenes [19,20].

Antibiotics (purchased from Sigma) were used at the following concentrations: carbenicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL), streptomycin (200 \u03bcg/mL), chloramphenicol (7.5 \u03bcg/mL for L. monocytogenes and 10 \u03bcg/mL for E. coli), erythromycin (1 \u03bcg/mL), and tetracycline (2 \u03bcg/mL). All E. coli strains are listed in Table 2 and all L. monocytogenes strains are listed in Table 3. Bacterial broth growth curves were performed as previously described [69]. The suicide strain was a gift from Peter Lauer and Bill Hanson (Aduro Biotech); details of its construction are reported elsewhere [17]. Briefly, loxP sites were inserted on either side of the origin of replication by allelic exchange into a \u0394actA\u0394inlB strain of L monocytogenes.
