These Tc cattle were engineered by homozygous knockout of both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain genes, bIGHM and bIGHML1 (bIGHM\u2212/\u2212, bIGHML1\u2212/\u2212; DKO) and by reconstituting B cell function with a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH), kappa-chain (hIGK), and lambda-chain (hIGL) germline loci. However, as the bovine endogenous immunoglobulin light-chain loci, the lambda (bIGL) locus and the kappa (bIGK) locus, are intact in these Tc cattle, the light-chains are expressed both from hIGK and hIGL loci on the HAC and from the endogenous bIGL and bIGK loci, resulting in a mixture of hIgGs composing fully hIgGs (both the heavy-chains and light-chains are of human origin: hIgG/hIg\u03ba and hIgG/hIg\u03bb) and chimeric hIgGs (only the heavy-chains are of human origin but the light-chains are of bovine origin: hIgG/bIg\u03ba and hIgG/bIg\u03bb). Specifically, when the hIgG isotype was analyzed in the sera of Tc bovine, hIgG/bIg\u03bb accounted for about 70% and hIgG/bIg\u03ba accounted for about 10% of the total hIgGs, respectively, while fully hIgG only accounted for about 20% of the total hIgGs (Sano A et al., 2013). We reasoned that the human immunoglobulin light-chain genes carried on the HAC are controlled by human regulatory sequences and may be at a disadvantage in competing with the endogenous bovine immunoglobulin light-chain genes for expression in the bovine B cell environment. As bIg\u03bb is the predominantly expressed light-chain isotype in bovine B cells, we further reasoned that inactivation of bovine lambda light-chain genes, in addition to the KO of the two bIGHM and bIGHML1 loci, would dramatically improve fully hIgG production in the resulting Tc cattle.",

            "text": "We previously developed a sequential gene targeting strategy and succeeded in producing cloned cattle carrying homozygous knockout of both the immunoglobulin mu and the prion proteins [3]. One of the core components of this sequential gene targeting strategy is to use embryonic cloning by CT to rejuvenate the genetically modified cells following each round of gene targeting [3], [4]. This sequential gene targeting strategy overcomes the limitation set by the cellular senesce program in cultured somatic cells and, in theory, allows one to sequentially modify the genome of somatic cells as many rounds as one wishes. However, as every round of gene targeting requires a round of embryonic cloning by CT to rejuvenate the cells, our recent results showed that cumulative epigenetic errors can be introduced into the (re)cloned cells at each round of embryonic cloning, which in turn severely compromises the developmental competence of the cloned embryos reconstituted from such sequentially (re)cloned cells (our unpublished data). As the goal of this project was to produce TKO Tc cattle where the two bIGH loci, IGHM and IGHML, and the bIGL locus, IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, were to be homozygously inactivated, it would take four rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to KO the IGHM and IGHML loci and another four more rounds to KO the bIGL locus (see below for details), entailing eight rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning in total. Even though we succeeded in cloning transgenic cattle after seven rounds of embryonic cloning, the cloning efficiency was extremely low [5]. Therefore, we designed a new sequential gene targeting strategy by incorporating animal breeding as an integral component. Specifically, after two to three rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning, live animals were produced by CT and raised to sexual maturity for breeding. It is believed, and has been proven by us (our unpublished data), that germline transmission of the cloned genome erases the epigenetic errors acquired from cloning. Therefore, primary cell lines carrying the introduced genetic modifications can be established from the fetuses produced from breeding (we call the cell lines established from fetuses produced by fertilization G0 cell lines) and more rounds of genetic modifications can proceed (i.e. G1, G2\u2026). Figure 1A depicts the gene targeting scheme that we undertook to sequentially KO the bIGHM, IGHML1 and IGL loci for producing TKO cell lines. Of note, contrary to what has been reported by others that the IGHML1 locus was mapped on bovine chromosome 11 (bChr11) (Hosseini, A et al. 2004), our sequence analysis of the bovine IGHM and IGHML1 loci demonstrated that both of these loci are located on bChr21 (our unpublished data). Such chromosomal localization dictates that the IGHM and IGHML1 loci segregate together during meiosis, allowing us to implement the animal breeding-assisted sequential gene targeting strategy and calculate the probability of the desired genotypes of fetuses produced by breeding (hence the cell lines established from the fetuses) of these two genomic loci as depicted in Figure 1B.",

By screening a BAC genomic library with probes specific to the bovine immunoglobulin lambda constant region sequences (GenBank AF396698); we isolated a positive BAC clone and subjected it to shotgun sequencing. Sequence analysis (Figure S3) led to the identification of the entire bovine IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster composed of the five IGLJ-IGLC genes (IGLJ1-IGLC1 through IGLJ5-IGLC5) (Figure 1C). Among them, IGLJ2-IGLC2, IGLJ3-IGLC3 and IGLJ4-IGLC4 appeared to be functional genes as judged by their uninterrupted reading frames coding for functional proteins (Figure 1C). On the other hand, both the IGLJ1-IGLC1 and IGLJ5-IGLC5 genes contain immature stop codon mutations, indicating that they are pseudo genes. We also identified a potential enhancer element, 3\u2032E\u03bb, about 13 kb downstream of the IGLJ5-IGLC5 gene that shares \u223c60% DNA sequence homology with the human 3\u2032E\u03bb (HSS-3) enhancer sequence.

            "text": "Compared to the report by Chen, L et al. where four IGLJ-IGLC genes were identified in the bovine [6], we identified five IGLJ-IGLC genes based on our sequence data. We found that there is a duplication of the originally identified IGLJ2-IGLC2 by Chen et al. and that the duplicated genes are identical in their exon sequences but are subtly different in their intron and 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) sequences. As such, we concluded that this is a distinct IGLJ-IGLC gene from IGLJ2-IGLC2 and defined it as IGLJ3-IGLC3. Our sequence analysis also indicates that this gene is located about 4 kb downstream of IGLJ2-IGLC2 (Figure 1C). The discrepancy on the numbers of IGLJ gene unites in the bIGL locus between what was found by Chen et al. and by us is likely attributed to the fact that the coding sequences of IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3 exons are identical and were not detected as distinct gene units by Chen L et al. However, our detailed sequence analysis showed that these two gene units are different in the sequences of introns and 3\u2032 UTRs (Figure S1 Panels A and B). Our interpretation of the structure of the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster was further supported by Southern blot data we produced from analyzing the genomic DNA isolated from fibroblast cells derived both from Holstein and Jersey breed cattle (Figure 2). Due to the relatively short shotgun sequences (1.5\u20133.0 kb by Chen et al.), genes with high sequence homologies, such as between IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3, may not be readily identified as distinct genes if the sequence assembled from shotgun sequencing is the only resource used for characterizing a genomic locus. Therefore, our Southern blot data provided unequivocal support for our conclusion that there are five IGLJ-IGLC genes (IGLJ1-IGLC1 through IGLJ5-IGLC5) in the bovine genome.",

For distinguishing the bIGL alleles in these two cell lines where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified (Figure 4) and for designing and constructing allele-specific KI vectors, we designated the bIGL alleles in J481 as A and D, and those in H412 as B and C, respectively (Figure 4A; only A and D alleles in J481 are depicted). To delete the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster in the J481 cell line, we first transfected J481 cells with the allele A-specific KI vector, pC\u03bb1(A)CAGzeoPuroloxPDT, to integrate the loxP sequence at a position 5\u2032 of the bIGLJ-IGLC1 gene. After selection of transfected cells with zeocin, the zeocin-resistant cell colonies were screened for the desired gene targeting event with genomic PCR. As depicted in (Figure 4A), we designed a pair of PCR primers, CL1puro-F2/CL1puro-R2, that specifically amplified the DNA sequence generated by the correct integration of the loxP sequence through homologous recombination at a position 5\u2032 of the bIGLJ1-IGLC1 gene. Following sequencing of the PCR products, 18% (25/140) of the zeocin-resistant colonies were confirmed to be correctly targeted. We also used another pair of PCR primers, R-R1 x R-F2, flanking the SNPs that distinguished the A and D alleles and specifically amplified the untargeted allele to investigate which of the two alleles were targeted. By sequencing the PCR products generated from this pair of primers, we identified a cell colony, #27, that was positive for the nucleotide G (specific to allele D) but negative for nucleotide T (specific to allele A) in the SNPs region, indicating that allele A was correctly targeted while allele D was intact (Figure 4A). We then subjected colony #27 to embryonic cloning to generate 40d fetuses from which five fibroblast cell lines were established.

We performed the experiments with the intention to reduce one round of transfection and one round of embryonic cloning in deleting the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster; otherwise, one round of transfection with the second loxP KI vector followed by one round of embryonic cloning would be needed before transfecting the cells with Cre-expression plasmid. After co-transfecting K655-1 cells with the pC\u03bb5(A)CAGloxPneoDT KI vector designed to be specific to allele A and the Cre-expression plasmid, 21 puromycin-resistant colonies were obtained. We subjected these colonies to genomic PCR screening by using two pairs of PCR primers, CL5CAG-F2/CL5CAG-R2 and CAGpuro-F3/CAGpuro-R3, with the former to identify the correct targeting event 3\u2032 of the bIGLC5 gene and the latter to detect the desired cluster deletion event induced by loxP/Cre-mediated chromosome recombination (Figure 4B). All of the 21 colonies were confirmed to carry the desired bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion by PCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products. We then conducted embryonic cloning by using the cells from some of these positive colonies as chromatin donors and established multiple 40d cell lines (G2). As expected, genotyping analysis showed that all of these cell lines carried the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion as well as the inactivated alleles in the IGHM and IGHML1 loci introduced earlier, confirming the establishment of cell lines with the IGHM\n\u2212/\u2212\nIGHML1\n\u2212/+\nIGL\n\u2212/+ genotype.

In comparison to kHAC that we reported previously where only the hIGH locus and hIGK locus were incorporated [5], all of the human immunoglobulin germline loci, the hIGH locus from human chromosome 14 (hChr14), the hIGK locus from hChr2, and the surrogate light-chain (hSLC) and hIGL loci from hChr22 were incorporated (Sano et al., 2013). In addition, in the newly engineered cKSL-HAC\u0394, the hIgM constant domain which is believed to be involved in the interaction between IgM and transmembrane \u03b1 (Ig\u03b1) and \u03b2 immunoglobulins (Ig\u03b2) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex was replaced by the bovine IgM constant domain, an effort for improving the interactions between hIgM and bovine Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. In addition to the improved levels of hIgG production, this new version of HAC also dramatically improved B cell development in the DKO Tc cattle (Sano et al., 2013). Therefore, we transferred the cKSL-HAC\u0394 from a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) master cell bank that we established (Sano et al., 2013) into the above established TKO bovine fibroblast cells by Micro-cell Mediated Chromosome Transfer (MMCT) and established cKSL-HAC\u0394/TKO fibroblast cell lines (see Materials and Methods section for details) for TKO Tc cattle production.

We demonstrated that DKO Tc cattle produce physiological level of hIgGs. Furthermore, through immunization studies these Tc cattle were shown to be responsive to antigen challenge generating high titers and functional antigen-specific hIgGs. However, as the bovine endogenous immunoglobulin light-chain genes are intact in these Tc cattle and the bovine genes may be epigenetically favored for expression in bovine B cells (e.g. regulated by bovine trans-elements) over the human immunoglobulin light-chain genes carried by the HAC, the majority of hIgGs produced from these cattle were chimeric, with the IgG heavy-chain of human origin and light-chain of bovine origin (Sano A et al., 2013).",

It has been well established that, between the two bovine Ig light-chain loci, bIGL and bIGK, the bIGL locus is the predominant bovine Ig light-chain over the bIGK locus, resulting in an Ig\u03bb/Ig\u03ba ratio of 91/9 in wild type cattle [13]. Therefore, as the next step towards fully hIgG production in Tc cattle, we chose to genetically inactivate the bovine bIGL locus. However, as there are about 25 lambda variable (IGLV) genes spanning about 400 kb in the bovine genome [7], neither an individual KO nor a whole IGLV cluster deletion seemed to be a feasible approach. This is particularly true considering the fact that there are no precedent studies showing that the Cre/loxP strategy is effective in deleting large chromosomal fragments in somatic cells. Consequently, we decided to inactivate the bIGL locus by deleting the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, as the size has been previously estimated to be approximately 18.6 kb (Chen L et al. 2008; our more detailed sequence analysis indicates it is about 27 kb; see results section of this manuscript). We reasoned that the relative smaller size of this locus compared to the IGLV locus could be more amenable to Cre/loxP-mediated deletion. Therefore, we conducted detailed characterization of the bovine IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, which allowed us to design and construct the gene targeting vectors to completely delete this locus. We demonstrated that the Cre/loxP system was very effective in inducing chromosome deletions in a site-specific manner in primary somatic cells. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first demonstration of this application of the Cre/loxP system in cultured primary somatic cells in any mammalian species.",

Previously, we developed a sequential gene targeting strategy and achieved inactivation of up to six genomic loci in bovine somatic cells. However, if this sequential gene targeting strategy were followed in the instance of knocking out the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, it would take ten rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to homozygously inactivate the two IGH loci and delete the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster\u2014four rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning would be needed to inactivate the four alleles of the IGH genes and six more rounds would be needed to homozygously delete the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster (deleting one allele requires two rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to integrate the two loxP sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, respectively, and the induction of IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion by transfecting cells with Cre expression vector requires another round of gene targeting and embryonic cloning; the same applies for the second allele also). To reduce the rounds of embryonic cloning and avoid the cumulative epigenetic errors that are introduced at each round of embryonic cloning, which can severely compromise the development potential of embryos reconstituted from the genetically modified cells by CT (our unpublished data), we decided to hemizygously delete the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster in both a male and a female bovine cell line in which the IGHM and IGHML loci had been modified to produce male and female animals and breed them to produce homozygous offspring. To reduce the rounds of embryonic cloning even further, after integrating the first loxP sequence at 5\u2032 of the IGLJ1 gene, we co-transfected the second loxP KI vector with the Cre expression vector to achieve integration of the second loxP sequence and the subsequent deletion of the IGLJ-IGLC cluster between the two integrated loxP sequences with one round of cell transfection. We demonstrated that this strategy was very successful and allowed us to achieve the goal of producing Tc calves with both of the IGHM and IGHML loci and the IGL locus homozygous inactivated (IGHM\n\u2212/\u2212\nIGHML1\n\u2212/\u2212\nIGL\n\u2212/\u2212).",

In addition, as an effort to improve fully human antibody production by Tc bovine, we have recently achieved the bovinization of some sequences on the HAC that are important for Ig function and/or expression, resulting in an average of over 80% of the serum IgGs produced from the TKO/Tc cattle to be fully human IgGs (manuscript in preparation).",

From this plasmid, a 9.8 kb BamHI fragment was further cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK(-). To this resulting plasmid, we then inserted a STOPhyg cassette into the Bgl II site and DT-A cassette into Not I site to generate the pBC\u03bc7AYJKOhyg gene targeting vector.",
