Cameroon's Ministry of Health (MOH) was rapidly notified and within 24 hours activated their public health emergency operations center for rapid investigation and response for potential infection in humans.2 Public health officials closely monitored individuals with poultry exposure and ultimately, no humans with influenza A (H5N1) virus infection were diagnosed.",

The MOH's Division for the Fight against Disease, Epidemics and Pandemics (Direction de la Lutte Contre la Maladie, les Epid\u00e9mies et les Pand\u00e9mies [DLMEP]) coordinates a national surveillance platform for integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR), where cases of priority diseases are counted weekly and registered at the national level.3 Each health facility is expected to routinely report aggregate IDSR data and immediately notify DLMEP if a suspected outbreak occurs. The other surveillance system was an indicator\u2010based sentinel surveillance for influenza, coordinated by the Centre Pasteur du Cameroun (CPC), Cameroon's national influenza center, where 16 hospitals (five of which were in Yaound\u00e9) utilize the World Health Organization (WHO) standard case definitions for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and/or influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) to detect possible influenza cases.4, 5, 6\n",

The existing IDSR and influenza surveillance systems in theory contributed to routine counting of SARI, ILI, and atypical respiratory cases; however, neither system reliably notified the MOH of suspected outbreaks in a timely way, despite specific instructions to do so within IDSR. During the H5N1 outbreak, it was unclear whether Yaound\u00e9 health facilities would recognize potential human infections with avian influenza, and if they did, whether the MOH would be alerted rapidly to initiate control measures. To improve timely detection and immediate notification of suspected outbreaks, the MOH, with support from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), implemented an event\u2010based surveillance (EBS) program focused on detection of unusual respiratory events in Yaound\u00e9.",

Prior to EBS, large Yaound\u00e9 health facilities seldom communicated unusual cases to the public health authorities, with poor adherence to IDSR reporting requirements. Cameroon's MOH implemented EBS in Yaound\u00e9 to enable rapid detection and notification of emerging respiratory events, and to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first report that focuses on EBS implementation with healthcare facilities providing the primary source of data. Improving capacity for detection of public health events is an important component of the International Health Regulations, a 2005 global agreement to improve health security.",

First, EBS does not require clinicians to follow a specific case definition, but rather encourages medical professionals to draw upon their clinical training and experience to recognize that something is unusual or unexpected. The signals in EBS are designed for clinicians to recognize patterns and unusual trends, in contrast to traditional surveillance case definitions, which are based on disease\u2010specific identification (Table 1). Second, by utilizing a short list of signals and not requiring any documentation at the health facility, it was easy for clinical staff to engage with the EBS system. The health facility was simply required to call the public health authorities when they detected one or more of the signals. Lastly, health facility EBS systems do not require laboratory confirmation as a condition of reporting. While this pilot integrated a mechanism for laboratory testing during the verification process, outside of the capital, Cameroon does not have reliable laboratory capacity, and surveillance systems that rely on laboratory confirmation could potentially delay reporting from healthcare facilities. By incorporating laboratory testing, however, as a component of verification, clinicians in this pilot gained a non\u2010financial incentive to participate in EBS, that is, access to laboratory testing for their patients that might not have otherwise been available.",

DLMEP did not consider any of the events to warrant additional public health action. Despite this, however, an important outcome of the pilot was that EBS helped promote behavior change among clinicians and health facility staff toward detection and reporting of potential outbreaks. An example of this was at health facility E, where a suspected hospital\u2010acquired infection was recognized and reported as a potential public health threat within 24 hours of detection. The EBS system enabled the clinician to recognize that a potential hospital\u2010acquired infection could be a risk to public health and that notification was warranted and provided a mechanism to report to public health officials. While the doctor was ultimately diagnosed with rhinovirus, and the situation was deemed low risk, the clinician's heightened public health awareness helped to strengthen communication and reporting practices.",

This finding is consistent with EBS systems where triage and verification take place at healthcare facilities, such as in Ethiopia where 64% of EBS reports from health centers were verified and found to be true events.13 In Ratnayake et al, where community EBS was implemented for detection of Ebola virus disease, approximately 2% of signal alerts corresponded to a patient who met the case definition of suspected, probable or confirmed case.11 In our study, a large proportion of the reported signals were determined to be events, however, because clinicians and health facility staff are trained in health and medicine, their judgment of what constitutes a signal and when to report may represent an early type of filtering, reducing background noise.",

Additionally, after the pilot launch, signals were routinely detected and reported by the health facilities for the first 5 weeks. There was a drop in reporting after the initial weeks, which improved again following a DLMEP refresher training. A pattern of waning clinician engagement was observed, likely because of competing clinical demands and responsibilities. This illustrated that the relationship between health facilities and the public health system can be delicate, but that supportive supervision and feedback from the MOH can help to improve motivation. A reliance on supportive supervision for improved performance is noted in other surveillance systems.23, 24 Fostering hospital engagement and relationships contributes to continued reporting and program sustainability.",
