B. anthracis can infect its host through respiratory, cutaneous or gastrointestinal routes. Inhalation anthrax is the most lethal form of the disease associated with high fatality rate and occurs when endospores enter the lungs during respiration. Ames is a virulent strain of B. anthracis which contains three main virulence factors encoded on two plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2. The pXO1 plasmid encodes anthrax edema and lethal toxins (ET and LT, respectively), which are composed of three proteins, the edema factor (EF), the protective antigen (PA), and the lethal factor (LF). The pXO2 plasmid encodes genes that are responsible for the synthesis of a layer of poly-\u03b3-d-glutamic acid (PGA) capsule outside of the bacterial cell wall [1]. The capsule is relatively non-immunogenic and allows B. anthracis to escape immune-surveillance of the host [2]. Furthermore, this capsule may protect B. anthracis from phagocytosis. Under appropriate conditions, B. anthracis spores germinate into vegetative bacilli, disrupt phagocytes and penetrate into the circulatory system where high levels of the toxin are secreted. The Sterne strain of B. anthracis is an attenuated strain that does not carry the pXO2 plasmid (pXO1+, pXO2\u2212) and thus is not encapsulated, making it more susceptible to phagocytosis.",

            "text": "Host innate immune system expresses Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize components of B. anthracis. For example, anthrolysin O (ALO), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) secreted by B. anthracis, is a potent agonist of TLR4. Exposing bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) to ALO results in robust up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression [3]. Following engagement of ligands to TLR4, adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF are recruited to the receptor, resulting in the activation of transcription factors NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), respectively [4]. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is also employed upon TLR activation to orchestrate the expression of pro-inflammatory and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [5]\u2013[7]. However, B. anthracis has evolved ways to impair these host responses and thereby allowing growth of bacteria and establishment of infection. For instance, LF is a zinc-dependent bacterial protease that cleaves the amino terminus of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1 and MEK2) and this cleavage inactivates MEK1 and inhibits the MAPK signal transduction pathway [8]\u2013[11]. Also, EF is a highly active bacterial adenylyl cyclase that elevates intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP and de-regulates cellular gene transcriptions.",

Because of its virulence, the Ames strain is used as a benchmark for testing the effectiveness of any new vaccines that are under development [12]. Immunization using the live, attenuated Sterne strain is able to stimulate a protective immune response and is effective as a vaccine against domesticated animals for many decades worldwide. It has also been used to vaccinate humans in Eastern European countries [13], [14]. Although the mechanism of how B. anthracis toxins impairs host immune systems has been well characterized, cellular responses to Ames versus Sterne spore infections has not been fully investigated in primary cells. The objective of this study is to profile host transcriptional responses after exposing rhesus macaque AMs to either the virulent Ames or attenuated vaccine Sterne strains of B. anthracis. We present evidence that primary AMs exhibit differential transcriptional gene expression profiles following infection with Ames or Sterne spores. A total of 913 rhesus macaque genes, which are matched to 528 human orthologs, were identified to be differentially expressed using microarray analysis. These 528 genes are hierarchically clustered into 4 subsets based on their expression patterns over the time course study. Microarray gene expression was further validated by quantifying mRNA or protein expression levels of several cytokines and chemokines. For example, AMs infected with Sterne spores preferentially induced the production of TNF-\u03b1, CCL5 and CCL3. Furthermore, expression patterns of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are important mediators of inflammation upon pathogen infection, were also investigated. AMs infected with Ames spores exhibit delayed expression of COX2 gene which in turn correlates with a delay in production of PGE2 expression.",

All microarray data were processed with both gcRMA algorithm and MAS5 algorithm. MAS5 algorithm marked each probe set as Present (\u201cP\u201d), Marginal (\u201cM\u201d), or Absent (\u201cA\u201d) within a hybridization. If a probe set was marked as \u201cA\u201d in more than three out of five host replicates, it was considered as absent in the given biological condition. If a probe set was absent across all time points, it was removed from further analysis. A paired t-test was applied between the two treatment groups of each time point, respectively, where expression data from the same host were paired. Those probe sets with P-value \u22640.05 and fold change more than cutoffs were considered as differentially expressed genes and were retained. The fold change cutoff thresholds for each time point were determined by the average two standard deviations calculated from linear regression of two treatment data at each corresponding time point, which is always more than two fold (i.e., absolute difference between their average log2 gcRMA expression levels is at least 1.0). Only probe sets that could be mapped to rhesus macaque Entrez Gene IDs according to the latest Affymetrix annotation file (release 33) were retained. When multiple probe sets mapped into the same gene, the probe set with the largest statistically significant fold change value in any conditions was retained as the representative probe set of the gene. According to the latest NCBI Homologene database, probe sets were also mapped to human orthologs via their rhesus macaque gene IDs.

All three strains of B. anthracis were phagocytosed by AMs following infection. However, in comparison with the Ames strain, engulfment of Sterne spores and subsequent outgrowth into vegetative bacilli was observed as early as 2 h post-infection and distinct long chains of vegetative bacteria were visible by 6 h post-infection. This data suggests that AMs have the ability to phagocytose both Ames and Sterne spores and those bacteria that survive are able to germinate and replicate within the cytoplasm. The observed differences in the vegetative growth kinetics between Sterne and Ames B. anthracis may be attributed to the presence of the anti-phagocytic capsule in the Ames B. anthracis.",

The bacterial viability continued to decline with a slower rate for up to 6 h post\u2013infection for Ames, while the Sterne strain returned to the initial levels at 6 h post-infection. These results suggest that the AMs are functionally active as they are able to kill phagocytosed bacteria. The Sterne strain replicated more robustly by 6 h post-infection, and thus further supporting the vegetative growth observed by confocal microscopy (Figure 1B).

Infection of AMs with Ames and Sterne spores (both LT producing B. anthracis) showed complete MEK1 cleavage at 6 h post infection (Figure 2A, top panel), a pattern similar to that observed with externally added LT [11]. Cleavage of MEK1 did not affect the integrity of p44/p42 and p38 but instead impaired its ability to phosphorylate p44/p42 and p38 and as confirmed by densitometry scans of the western blots (Figure 2A, bottom panel). As a negative control, AMs incubated with latex beads (LB) showed normal MEK1 expression. To determine if MEK1 cleavage would result in cell death, AMs were infected with Sterne spores and cell viability was quantified by the uptake of membrane impermeable Sytox green dye [19]. A greater than 90% cell survival rate was observed in Sterne infected AMs while less than 10% viability was observed in J774A.1 macrophages, an LT-susceptible cell line (Figure 2B). These results, together with our previously published studies with externally added B. anthracis LT [11], demonstrate that both externally added LT as well as LT produced following B. anthracis infection causes the AMs to become susceptible to MEK1 cleavage and resistant to the killing effects by Sterne B. anthracis.",

Cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CCL5, CCL3, IL-8 and IL-18 were induced following infection (Figure 3).

Both TLRs and NOD like receptors (NLRs) have been reported to detect B. anthracis components. For example, B. anthracis cell wall components and PA are sensed by TLR2/6 hetero-dimers and anthrolysin O is a potent agonist of TLR4 [3], [20]. NOD2, an intracellular sensor of bacterial LF, also plays a key role in the B. anthracis-induced IL-1\u03b2 production [21]. Two distinct signaling cascades are required for the production of mature IL-1\u03b2. The first signal event is responsible for the production of IL-1\u03b2 precursor which is predominantly mediated by the activation of NF-\u03baB. Secondly, in response to B. anthracis infection, IL-1\u03b2 precursor is cleaved by an inflammasome that is composed of NOD2, NALP-1 and caspase-1 [21]. Our data suggests that NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is activated after infection with both Ames and Sterne spores. This is measured by the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8, which are NF-\u03baB dependent genes. The fact that IL-1\u03b2 secretion was up-regulated in AMs infected for 18 h with Ames but not with Sterne spores suggests that inflammasome is preferentially activated in response to infections with Ames spores.",

Several genes (CCL20, NR4A2 and NR4A3) that were observed to be up-regulated in this study had previously been reported in a microarray study conducted in human AMs infected with the Sterne spores and served as quality controls [22].

Genes that show differential expression levels were hierarchically clustered into 4 major subsets based on the 1) kinetics of the gene expression pattern, and 2) their similarities or differences in the expression pattern in Ames vs. Sterne infected AMs (Figure 4 & Table S1).

Our microarray analyses showed that these two chemokines were differentially expressed after Ames and Sterne infections (Figures 4 and S1, Table S1). Consistent with the microarray analyses was the observed rapid induction of CCL3 protein at 4 h post infection but at lower levels in Ames compared to Sterne infection (Figure 3). In addition, similar differential expression patterns for CCL5 were observed between Sterne and Ames infection both at the gene and protein levels after 4 h or 18 h post-infection respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that AMs infected with Ames or Sterne display differential cytokine and chemokine gene and protein expression patterns. Furthermore, a time-dependent expression of certain chemokines and cytokines may govern the outcome of the immune response upon B. anthracis infection.",

            "text": "AMs initiate bactericidal activities once they phagocytose B. anthracis spores. Activated macrophages migrate to the draining lymph nodes to present antigens and assist in the activation of the adaptive immune response [19]. Homing of macrophages to draining lymph nodes is mediated by the proinflammatory chemokine receptor, CCR7, which can be up-regulated by PGE2\n[19], [24]. PGE2 is derived from prostaglandin H2 which in turn is generated from arachadonic acid by the enzymatic action of COX-2 [25]\u2013[27]. Furthermore, activated macrophages also release CCL5 and CCL20 that recruit immature DC and T cells, respectively, to the inflammatory site [28]\u2013[30]. Our gene expression data showed increased levels of CCL5, CCR7 and COX-2 in Sterne-infected AMs than Ames-infected AMs (Figure S1). We, therefore, decided to further examine the expression pattern of COX-2 and PGE2 in AMs infected with Ames or Sterne spores. The COX-2 mRNA expression measured by real-time PCR confirmed the microarray analysis data (Figure 6A and Figure S1). After infecting AMs with Sterne spores, COX-2 mRNA was rapidly induced by 90 minutes. It continued to rise by \u223c32 fold and peaked at 4 h post infection. However, COX-2 expression was attenuated by 18 h post infection. On the contrary, COX-2 mRNA expression was much reduced at 90 minutes following Ames spore infection, but continued to rise till 4 h and its expression was sustained up to 18 h post-infection. A statistically significant difference (p<0.05) was observed in COX-2 expression between Sterne and Ames at 18 hrs post-infection.",

In fact, an increase in PGE2 production was observed in Sterne infected AMs over the 18 h time course (Figure 6B). Despite the fact that COX-2 mRNA expression in Sterne infected AMs is attenuated by 18 h, the amount of PGE2 detected is sustained. A statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in PGE2 production was observed between Sterne and Ames at 4 h post-infection. Furthermore, the time-dependent kinetics of PGE2 production in Ames infected AMs correlates to that of the COX-2 mRNA expression (Figure 6A).

            "text": "\nB. anthracis LF cleaves MEK1 and impairs the induction of p38 dependent anti-apoptotic genes. As a result, BMDMs from C57BL/6 undergo programmed cell death after exposure to LF [32]. Our microarray data identified 24 anti-apoptotic genes that are preferentially up-regulated in Sterne infected AMs (Table S2). Of these 24 anti-apoptotic genes, 11 and 13 of these genes were expressed at early (up to 120 mins post-infection) and late (from 120 to 360 mins post-infection) stages, respectively. The expressions of these anti-apoptotic genes may contribute to the survival of AMs after Sterne infections. In these studies, we measured the MEK1 cleavage at either very early (30 mins) or late (360 mins) time point post-infection. Although we have not measured the MEK1 cleavage pattern at the intermediate time points, we speculate that up to 120 mins the amount of LF being produced is not sufficient to degrade MEK1. As a result, the MAPK signaling cascade is intact; p38 dependent transcription factors and NF-\u03baB are able to up-regulate the anti-apoptotic genes that are expressed at early and late time points [33]. At 6 h post Ames or Sterne infection MEK1 degradation was observed. As a result, p38 can no longer be phosphorylated (Figure 2A). Promoter analysis reveals multiple putative p38 dependent transcription factor binding sites in these 13 anti-apoptotic genes that are expressed at later stage (Figure S2) [34]. It is unclear how 13 anti-apoptotic genes are regulated in the absence of p38 activity at later stage of infection. The requirement of p38 dependent transcription factors in mediating the expression of these genes, therefore, needs to be empirically determined. Strikingly, instead of up-regulating anti-apoptotic genes, 14 pro-apoptotic genes are induced in Ames infected AMs (Figure 4). The distinct differences in apoptosis regulation further delineate the differences in pathogenicity between Ames and Sterne strains.",

            "text": "In summary, this study presents evidence that infection of AMs with either Sterne or Ames spores results in time-dependent quantitative differences in gene expression and protein production of certain cytokines, chemokines and host factors. In particular, TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 protein secretions were up-regulated in Sterne or Ames infected AMs, respectively. Preferential expression of either TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 suggests different signal transduction pathways downstream of TLR and NOD2 are activated. The ability of B. anthracis to activate multiple innate immune receptors may govern the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, differential expression of apoptotic versus anti-apoptotic genes may contribute to the survival of AMs in response to B. anthracis infections. We observed that AMs infected with Ames spores up-regulated apoptotic genes whereas AMs infected with Sterne spores up-regulated anti-apoptotic genes (Figure 7). These studies also suggest that the observed differences in host response are probably not due to the delay in the uptake of the Ames spores as different gene sets are modulated following Ames or Sterne infection. Lastly, the observed time-dependent kinetic differences in the production of COX-2 and PGE2 may lead to a more robust immune response in AMs infected with Sterne spores and a slower onset of immune response in Ames-infected AM. Together, these studies provide insight into the differential host cellular mechanisms employed by the virulent Ames or vaccine Sterne strain of B. anthracis.",
