Although no cases of the closely-related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been reported since 2005 [1], the incidence of MERS-CoV infections and the number of affected countries both continue to increase. Epidemiological trends indicate that prevention of potential epidemic spread of MERS-CoV is likely to be a long and tough battle [2]. Unfortunately, no clinically-approved antiviral monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), small molecule drugs or vaccines against MERS-CoV are available.",

The classification of MERS-CoV as a biosafety level three (BSL-3) agent is an additional hurdle to progress in this area. Since the emergence of MERS-CoV, several animal species have been evaluated as potential models, including wild-type mice, mice deficient in innate immunity [3], Syrian hamsters [4], ferrets [5] and non-human primates (NHPs) [4,6]. Two NHPs (rhesus macaques and marmosets) were found to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, but other species including mice are naturally non-permissive to infection. Although human DPP4 (hDPP4) has been identified as the receptor for MERS-CoV [7] that mediates infection, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4) is not functional in this respect [8]. Mice adenovirally transduced with hDPP4 could be transiently infected by MERS-CoV but did not develop fatal MERS disease [9].Moreover, hDPP4-transgenic (Tg) mice expressing hDPP4 under the control of either the cytokeratin 18 promoter [10] or a ubiquitous promoter [11] were susceptible to MERS-CoV infection and developed fatal disease, but also developed unrelated lethal encephalitis. Two knock-in (KI) mice in which mDPP4 was replaced with hDPP4 using CRISPR/Cas9 [8,12] could be infected by high-titer MERS-CoV isolates but were more susceptible to mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strains. Since mDPP4 is central to normal glucose homeostasis [13] and plays an important role in immunity [14], altering its sequence may disrupt these functions.",

            "text": "A KI mouse was generated by inserting the full-length hDPP4 gene [7] into the Rosa26 locus, which has been shown to be a safe harbor for developing genetically stable KI mouse lines [33]. Expression of hDDP4cDNA was driven by the splice acceptor, which allowed ubiquitous expression of hDPP4 under control of the Rosa26 promoter. The tdTomato gene was inserted downstream of hDPP4 with an internal ribosome entry site allowing co-expression of tdTomato and hDPP4. A poly(A) sequence and a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) were added to enhance mRNA stability and translation efficiency (Figure 1A). The targeting vector along with subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and Cas9 mRNA were injected into zygotes of C57BL/6 mice. Successful insertion in nine of 41 offspring was positively confirmed by Southern blotting and the results for five mice are presented in Figure 1B. One male founder and one female founder died before weaning and two founders were too emaciated to mate. Five founders were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice, and two matings produced F1-positive offspring. Tail tips of F1-positive mice were subjected to PCR genotyping (Figure 1C) and Southern blotting to confirm correct insertion of hDPP4. Homozygous mice were termed B6-Gt (Rosa) 26 Sortm1 (SA-hDPP4-tdTomato), abbreviated to R26-hDPP4. Significant hDPP4 expression could be detected by RT-PCR in all R26-hDPP4 mouse tissues tested (Figure 1D), but no expression was detected in wild-type mice. Western blotting of lung and brain tissues confirmed hDPP4 expression (Figure 1E). Unlike Tg mice, which showed the highest-level expression of hDPP4 in heart and brain [11], R26-hDPP4 mice had the highest hDPP4 expression in lung. Profiting from the insertion of tdTomato downstream of hDPP4, the global expression patterns of hDPP4 were examined visually (Figure 1F) via bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Since the liver, intestine and lung have bigger volumes, they have brighter images than other organs.",

Although weight loss and viral loads provide important measures of mouse susceptibility, these parameters do not directly reflect pathologic changes. Therefore, the lungs, brains, livers, and kidneys collected from infected mice were subjected to histopathological analysis and IHC (Figure 2C\u2013O). By quantitative analysis of pathological scores, the symptoms of R26-hDPP4 mice were significantly different compared with wild-type mice (Figure 2C). Associated with these pathological changes, significant viral loads were detected in lung (Figure 2E). In the cerebellum, cerebral ganglia and cerebrum of R26-hDPP4 mice, perivascular gliosis was observed (Figure 2F; Supplementary Figure S1C) with accompanying virus detected in this organ (Figure 2G). No obvious lesions were observed in liver and kidney (Figure 2H) and no virus was detected in these organs (Figure 2I), despite the fact that a MERS-CoV-infected patient with acute nephritis has been reported [35]. By contrast, in the corresponding organs of wild-type mice, no or minimal pathological changes were observed and no virus could be detected (Figure 2J\u2013O).

To this end, a humanized mAb, H111-1, was generated by phage display methods and administered intravenously (I.V.) ata single dose (either 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) 6 h after infection with hCoV-EMC (1.5 \u00d7 105 PFUs). Administration of H111-1 significantly decreased viral titers in lungs (from 3 log PFUs to 0.9 log PFUs and1.2 log PFUS for the 5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively; Figure 3A), and reduced weight loss in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1). Viral titers in the higher mAb dose group were below the limit of detection. The average inhibition rates of authentic virus were 70% for 5 mg/kg mAb and 60% for 1 mg/kg mAb, respectively. Notably, mAbH111-1 completely ablated viral loads in the lungs in two of four mice in both low- and high- dose mAb groups (Figure 3A). IHC results confirmed lower viral loads in the lungs of mAb-treated mice (Figure 3(C\u278c,C\u278d)), while a reduction of viral load in cerebellum was less clear (Figure 3(C\u2786,C\u2787)). In addition, treatment with mAb H111-1 alleviated symptoms in both lung and brain (Figure 3(C\u278a,C\u278b,C\u278e,C\u278f)), with degeneration and necrosis of bronchial epithelial cells improving significantly in treated animals (Figure 3B, p < 0.05). These results indicated that humanized mAb H111 is a promising antiviral agent for preventing MERS-CoV infection. Importantly, these results also implied that the R26-hDPP4 mouse could be an effective model for evaluating antiviral agents against MERS-CoV in vivo.",

At first, we attributed this failure to low pseudovirus titer and therefore we optimized the parameters of pseudovirus production (Supplementary Figure S2A\u2013D). Finally, pseudovirus with titers up to 1.27 \u00d7 107.5 TCID50/mL (Supplementary Figure S2E) was obtained. The pseudovirus was then titrated in 4-week-old R26-hDPP4 mice, and the 50% animal infectious dose (AID50) was determined to be 10 TCID50/mL viatheintrathoracic (I.T.) route.",

Mice were anaesthetized and observed with a BLI system at various days p.i. Bioluminescence of the transgene-encoded Fluc reporter was first observed at day 2 p.i. in the abdomen, close to the injection site (Figure 4A). The bioluminescence then spread to the thoracic cavity by day 6 p.i. Bioluminescence reached peak intensity and then gradually weakened up to day 20 p.i. (Figure 4B). To identify the sites of infection, mice were dissected and their organs were observed on the day of peak infection. Figure 4C showed that thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, lung and muscle, among other organs and tissues, were infected by pseudovirus. Higher pseudoviruscopy numbers were detected in these organs (Figure 4D), illustrating that R26-hDPP4 mice could be efficiently infected by pseudovirus. Since MERS-CoV infection mainly causes clinical ARDS [37,38], the primary site of infection should be the respiratory tract. Therefore, to maximize infection in the respiratory tract, we infected mice via the I.T. route. Live-animal imaging showed that infection was mainly localized to the chest, with maximal infection occurring on days 10 and 11 p.i. Using the I.T. route, the major infected organs were the thymus, heart and lung (Figure 3C). A uniform infection profile was observed in all mice, indicating that I.T. challenge had some advantages over I.P. challenge. I.N. and I.V. challenge were also attempted but did not result in productive infection. To test the influence of the animals\u2019 age on susceptibility to infection, 4- to 9-week-old mice were inoculated with pseudovirus. Both younger and older mice could be infected, but younger mice were more susceptible (Figure 4E,F). As reported previously [30], fluorescence intensity and virus copy number in tissues were strongly correlated, suggesting that fluorescence intensity could be used as an indicator of pseudovirus infection. Pseudovirus infection caused no histopathological changes, indicating that this tool was safe in mice (Figure 4G). Notably, through BLI visualization and confirmation by IHC, we found that pseudovirus tended to infect bronchi (Figure 4H), a tropism shared with authentic virus (Figure 2E).",

BLI of all mice was performed on day 6 p.i. and inhibition rates were calculated. As shown in Figure 4E, when mice were challenged with 1.5 \u00d7 105 PFUs of authentic virus, the inhibition rate of H111-1 (1 mg/kg) was 60%. From the inhibition rate curve for pseudovirus infection, we deduced that the pseudovirus dose corresponding to 60% inhibition was 3.25 \u00d7 107 TCID50. That is, 1 TCID50 of pseudovirus was equivalent to 0.0046 PFU of authentic virus. We assumed that this quantitative parameter would be useful for screening antiviral agents and evaluating vaccines against MERS-CoV. Since the R26-hDPP4 mouse provided a suitable model for infection by both pseudotyped and authentic MERS-CoV, the pseudovirus model is a convenient tool to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of anti-MERS-CoV agents or vaccines in most biological laboratories that lack BSL-3 facilities.",

We tested the in vitro inhibitory effect of HR2P-M2 in the Huh7 cell line, and its IC50 was determined to be 4504.5 ng/mL. In order to determine the in vivo protective effect of HR2P-M2, 5-week-old R26-DPP4 mice were administered 1000 \u03bcg of peptide per mouse I.T., and 30 min later challenged with 3.8 \u00d7 106.5 TCID50 of pseudovirus using the same route. As shown in Figure 7, pseudovirus infection was clearly prevented by HR2P-M2: in one representative mouse, the pseudovirus signal decreased to levels similar to uninfected mice, representing full protection (Figure 7A,B). No or very weak pseudovirus signals were detected in lung, thymus and heart after dissection (Figure 7B), indicating that the R26-hDPP4 mouse model, like previous animal models, can be used for evaluation of antiviral peptides.",

            "text": "Respiratory disease (such as ARDS) and acute renal failure are the main symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, although patients with fatal disease in the CNS have been reported [40]. Therefore, an animal model of MERS-CoV disease that recapitulates the pathological characteristics in both respiratory tract and CNS, supports high-level virus replication in vivo, and exhibits lung pathology associated with ARDS is required. Moreover, the animal model must be economical, genetically stable, and show reproducible results [8]. Mouse-adapted viral strains have been widely used to establish infection models. Wherever possible, clinical isolates should be used in challenge experiments (http://www.gryphonscientific.com/gain-of-function/) [12]. Targeting transgenes to specific sites of the mouse genome has many advantages over the random insertion typically used in transgenic methods. Two hDPP4-KI mice created by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing were recently reported [8,12]. In these mice, mDPP4 gene was either replaced by hDPP4 or mutated and its function was disrupted. Since mDPP4 is endowed with different biological activities [44] in immunity and glycometabolism compared with hDPP4, we established KI mice by inserting full-length human DPP4 into the Rosa26 locus via CRISR/Cas9 to spare the function of mDPP4. Notably, the R26-hDPP4 mouse displayed an unusual expression profile, in which transgenic hDPP4 was stably and highly expressed in lung and also expressed to a lesser extent in brain and other organs (Figure 1D\u2013F). We reasoned that this expression pattern might support robust infection and lesions in lung and brain, both using pseudotyped and authentic MERS-CoV. We further reasoned that insertion ofhDPP4 into the safe harbor of the Rosa26 locus and conserving mDPP4 function would be an appropriate strategy for establishing a genetically stable animal model. The insertion of hDPP4 mean, and whether it has implications for the expression of mDPP4 and its biological activities, is not clear.",

Infected R26-hDPP4 mice experienced significant loss of body weight, up to 33.6%, which was comparable to that observed in mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain [21]. Higher viral titers than in previous reports [8] were detected in lungs and were accompanied by diffuse pathogenesis including widened alveolar septa, vascular dilatation and hyperemia, perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells, necrosis of bronchial epithelial cells, edema and hyaline membrane formation (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1). The pathophysiological findings were closely associated with clinical manifestations [45]. All infected R26-hDPP4mice had uniform disease symptoms with a significant difference observed between KI and wild-type mice, as revealed by quantitative pathological scores (Figure 2).",

In rhesus macaques, transient lower respiratory tract infection was accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration [4]. By contrast, severe interstitial pneumonia within filtration and alveolar edema were observed in infected marmosets [6]. Research using small animal models, such as a mouse transduced with an Ad5 vector expressing hDPP4 [9], a Tg mouse model [11], and KI mice created with CRISPR/Cas9 technology [8,12],provide uncontested evidence that the respiratory system is the main site of MERS-CoV infection, in agreement with most clinical manifestations [37]. In this study, we also showed that the lungs, especially the bronchi, were the primary sites of infection both for pseudotyped and authentic virus (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5; Table S1).",

[11] reported high viral loads in the brain, but no necrosis or inflammatory reactions were observed. In KI mice infected with a mouse-adapted viral strain, no viral replication was detected in brain, even at challenge doses of 5 \u00d7 106 PFUs. This animal model was heralded as having the advantage of mimicking the clinical manifestations of ARDS in the absence of CNS complications. However, even though respiratory infection and ARDS are common clinical symptoms of MERS-CoV infection, patients with severe neurological syndrome, including confusion, coma and ataxia as well as focal motor deficit, have been reported [40]. Here, when R26-hDDP4 mice were infected with the clinical strain hCoV-EMC at a dose of 1.5 \u00d7 105 PFUs, viral loads were detected using IHC assays (Figure 2) in the cerebellum, cerebral ganglia and cerebrum. In association with these viral loads, perivascular gliosis, an indicator of inflammatory reactions, was observed in these organs in all 12 R26-hDPP4mice irrespective of mAb administration or mAb ablation of inflammation (Figure 3). These phenomena were not observed in any wild-type mice challenged in the same manner. Since virus was mainly detected on the membranes of motor neurons, we reasoned that the dyskinesia observed in patients would also be manifested in mice. Additional studies to assess the possible nerve infection are being conducted, and viral loads in nervous system are considered to be titrated.",

Pseudovirus cell models are popularly applied since they are relatively easy to develop; however, pseudovirus animal models are not as widely available, even though they have more extensive potential applications. Pseudovirus animal models may be difficult to achieve due to lack of susceptibility and the absence of suitably infectious pseudoviruses. Previously, an inhibition assay based on the pseudovirus cell model was established and used to detect neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV [2]. However, these pseudoviruses failed to infect the R26-hDPP4 mouse, which was shown to be particularly susceptible to authentic virus. We presumed that this effect might be caused by low pseudovirus titer. Therefore, the codons of the S protein, backbone plasmid [22], and production conditions were optimized systematically, resulting in an increase in titer of about 1000-fold (Supplementary Figure S2) and finally resulting in the successful infection of R26-hDPP4 mice.",

We tried to infect R26-hDPP4-KI mice with pseudovirus by the I.N. route but this was unsuccessful. This failure might have resulted from the use of less than 50 \u03bcL of pseudovirus inoculum for nasal dripping; this dosage may not have been sufficient for a single round of infection. We found that different infection routes might result in different biodistribution. Pseudovirus was detected by BLI in the thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, muscle and intestine of mice infected via the I.P. route. However, for challenge via the I.T. route, pseudovirus was only observed in the thymus, heart and lung. Thus, the route of infection also had some effect on pseudovirus distribution. For example, viral loads might fail to be detected in the lungs of mice with minor I.P. infections. However, the I.T. route resulted in uniform infection patterns in the lungs, and especially in the bronchi (Figure 4 and Figure 5). The pseudovirus distribution pattern (Figure 4) was similar to that of Tg mice infected with authentic virus [11]. Mice as old as 9 weeks could be infected, but younger mice (i.e., those 4 to 5 weeks old) had better susceptibility. The pseudovirus infection caused no pathological lesions in multiple organs, indicating that this model was safe (Figure 4).",

As expected, m336 and H111-1 both showed outstanding inhibitory activity in the pseudovirus cell model (IC50 = 4.5 ng/mL) and pseudovirus mouse model. Moreover, mAb H111-1 was also effective in protecting R26-hDPP4 mice from authentic virus infection. The protective effects of a well-characterized peptide inhibitor, HR2P-M2 [26], were assessed in the pseudovirus model with results similar to those described above. Overall, this pseudovirus mouse model showed outcomes that were consistent with those of the authentic virus mouse model, and the R26-hDPP4-KI mouse is, therefore, a unique animal model for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines in biological laboratories lacking BSL-3 facilities.",

To allay these doubts, a combination analysis was deemed necessary in this study. As shown in Figure 5, the relevance of the pseudotyped and authentic virus models was demonstrated. We showed that the manifestations of infection in the lung, the main target of MERS-CoV infection, were very similar between the authentic and pseudovirus models and that in both cases infection was localized to the epithelial cells of the bronchi. A dose conversion between pseudotyped virus and authentic virus was calculated, indicating that this pseudovirus mouse model is reliable and can be used to evaluate the effects of antiviral agents. However, pseudovirus represents a single-cycle infection and without replication in vivo, it does not cause pathological changes. Authentic MERS-CoV infection model is a better choice when studying disease pathogenesis.",
