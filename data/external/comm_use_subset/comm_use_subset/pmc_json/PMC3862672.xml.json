            "text": "Infection with Helicobactor pylori (H. pylori) may result in chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer [1]\u2013[4]. Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) is one of the major toxins produced by H. pylori that may trigger molecular changes in gastric epithelial cells. [3]\u2013[10]. Secreted by the bacteria as a \u223c88-kDa single polypeptide [11], VacA contains amino-terminal 33.4-kDa (p33) and carboxy-terminal 54.8-kDa (p55) domains [11]\u2013[13]. It is believed that p33 is responsible for the assembly of VacA into stable hexamers that form an ion channel, which is required for VacA-induced toxicity, while p55 is responsible for VacA binding to cells [10], [12], [14], [15]. Following acid activation, a p33-dependent, anion-selective channel is formed, leading to VacA internalization and association with endosomal membranes [13]. It has been proposed that internalized VacA incorporated into channels accelerates the turnover of endosomal V-ATPases by augmenting the permeability of the endosomal membrane to anions, leading to the accumulation of osmotically active species such as NH4\n+\n[13], [16]. This event is believed to induce an osmotic imbalance involving late endosomes that provokes vacuolation. In this regard, VacA-induced vacuolation is inhibited by the V-ATPase activity inhibitor, Bafliomycin A1 [17]. In contrast, weak bases including NH4Cl that can be produced by the high urease activity of H. pylori significantly potentiates VacA-mediated vacuole formation in cultured cells [5], [18], [19].",

            "text": "VacA is also known to cause apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. It is now accepted that VacA targets mitochondria to mediate cell death [6], [10], [12], [20], [21]. The unresolved question has been whether VacA induces cytochrome c release by directly or indirectly targeting mitochondria. Domanska et al. showed that VacA forms ion channels on mitochondria in a p33-dependent manner [12], whereas Yamasaki and others suggested that VacA causes cytochrome c release indirectly by activating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bax [20]. The mechanism by which VacA induces Bax activation is not fully understood. Notably, both VacA-induced vacuolation and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly enhanced by NH4Cl, while ammonia per se did not induce significant cell injury [5], [20], [22]. According to these studies, NH4Cl is likely not necessary for VacA to initiate apoptosis but it significantly increases VacA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity [5]. Enhancement of both vacuolation and mitochondrial dysfunction by NH4Cl is inhibited by ion channel blockers, suggesting that membrane channel formation is required for both activities [17]. On the other hand, a study employing AZ-521 cells and MKN 28 cells demonstrated that apoptosis by neither VacA alone nor VacA in combination with NH4Cl was attenuated by Bafilomycin A1 [5], [20]. Thus at least in selected cell lines, NH4Cl may potentiate VacA-mediated apoptosis via an unknown mechanism that is independent of vacuolation.",

            "text": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a role in critical cellular functions by controlling protein folding and trafficking [23], [24]. Failure of the ER's capacity to resolve stress results in induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which interacts with other stress signaling pathways including those involved in inflammation and cell death [24], [25]. The ER stress transducers in mammalian cells are PKR-like ER-localized eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)-\u03b1 kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1(IRE-1), and Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [23], [26], [27]. In unstressed cells, these proteins are retained in an inactive conformation via their association with the ER-resident chaperone protein, glucose-regulated protein 78/immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (GRP78) [23], [26]. When unfolded proteins increase in the ER, GRP78 is released from PERK, ATG-6 and IRE-1, thereby activating the three ER stress sensors [23], [24]. ER stress, especially activation of PERK, leads to induction of nuclear C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) via phosphorylation of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor (eIF2)-\u03b1 [28], [29]. CHOP has been implicated as a key mediator of ER stress-induced cell death in diverse pathological conditions including gastric epithelial cell damage [30]\u2013[34], and is known to activate proteins that mediate mitochondrial dysfunction [25], [32], [34], [35]. Of note, CHOP has been reported to activate pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins including Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) [35]. These BH3-only proteins usually monitor cellular wellbeing but they participate in promoting Bax activation to initiate mitochondrial cell death when activated by cytotoxic signals [36]. However, contribution of ER stress and its downstream effectors during VacA-induced cell injury remains to be defined. To gain further mechanistic insight into VacA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death stimulated by ammonia, we investigated the effects of VacA and ammonia on the PERK- and CHOP-signaling pathway and its potential role in the activation of Bax, PARP cleavage, and cell death.",

In brief, after growth of H. pylori in Brucella broth containing 0.1% \u03b2-cyclodextrin at 37\u00b0C for 3\u20134 days with vigorous shaking in a controlled microaerobic atmosphere of 10% O2 and 10% CO2, VacA was precipitated from the culture supernatant with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate.

After washing the column with RX buffer, VacA was subsequently eluted with 50 mM glycine-HCl buffer (pH 1.0), which was promptly neutralized with 1 M Tris\u2013HCl (pH 10). After gel filtration on Superose 6HR 10/30 equilibrated with TBS buffer (60 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 M NaCl), purified VacA was concentrated and stored at \u221220\u00b0C (200 \u00b5g/ml). VacA concentration was measured using a bead enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. To activate VacA, 0.2 v/v 300 mM HCl was added to VacA preparations, which were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then neutralized with the same volume of 300 mM NaOH. The cells were treated with 120 nM of VacA [20]. In selected experiments, cells were treated with VacA in the presence of 5 mM NH4Cl, which was similar to the concentrations observed in human H. pylori-associated gastritis [38].",

Exclusion criteria were as follows: age <18 or >80 years, pregnancy, body mass index >30 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, malignancies, renal impairment, systemic infection, liver diseases, drug addiction, alcohol abuse, use of medications effective against H. pylori during the preceding 3 months, and chronic corticosteroid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. During endoscopic examination of Japanese patients, 2 biopsy specimens were obtained from the gastric antrum along the lesser curvature. One of the samples was subjected to RNA isolation. The other specimen was fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for histopathological examination. H. pylori status was assessed by the rapid urease test (Helicocheck, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokushima, Japan) and histology with Giemsa staining. Patients were considered positive for H. pylori infection when at least one of these examinations yielded positive results. Patients were defined as H. pylori-negative if all test results were negative.",

As previously reported, VacA alone triggered vacuolation in AZ-521 cells (Figure 1A) [18], which was increased in the presence of 5 mM NH4Cl (Figure 1A). VacA induced a mild increase in the number of apoptotic cells as confirmed by DAPI staining, whereas cell death was significantly enhanced when cells were incubated with VacA plus NH4Cl (Figure 1B). Next, we assessed whether VacA increases expression of CHOP, which has a pivotal role in ER-induced apoptosis. We incubated the cells with NH4Cl alone, VacA alone, or VacA plus NH4Cl and examined the CHOP protein by immunoblot analysis. CHOP protein was not present in untreated cells or NH4Cl-treated cells, whereas intoxication with VacA alone triggered weak expression of CHOP protein (Figure 2A). Of note, CHOP protein expression was augmented in cells treated with VacA plus NH4Cl (Figure 2A). Expression of CHOP mRNA was also increased by 13 fold in cells treated with VacA plus NH4Cl compared to untreated cells (Figure 2B), implying that CHOP was transcriptionally activated by apoptotic stimuli following ER stress. In fact, eIF2-\u03b1, which can cause transcriptional induction of CHOP downstream of ER-stress sensor PERK, was phosphorylated by incubation of cells with VacA plus NH4Cl (Figure 2C). These results suggested that induction of CHOP resulted from PERK activation via phosphorylation of eIF2-\u03b1. Expression of ER resident chaperone protein GRP78 mRNA was also significantly elevated in VacA-treated cells (Figure 3). Splicing of XBP-1 mRNA occurs downstream of the IRE-1 arm of ER stress; XBP-1 mRNA existed in both spliced and un-spliced form in untreated cells and this splicing pattern was not altered by VacA treatment (Figure S1). Up-regulation of ATF-6 mRNA was also not observed following VacA treatment (data not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that VacA in the presence of NH4Cl is capable of inducing ER stress, especially involving the downstream targets of PERK.",

AZ-521 cells were transfected with siRNA targeted to CHOP and inhibition of transcriptional expression was assessed by real-time PCR (Figure 4A). In response to treatment with both VacA alone and VacA plus NH4Cl, cells with knockdown of CHOP showed significant suppression of apoptosis (Figure 4B) and PARP cleavage (Figure 4C and D), indicating that CHOP participates in VacA-induced apoptosis. In subsequent studies, we tested whether induction of CHOP and its downstream apoptotic signaling was mediated by PERK. Indeed, PERK knockdown attenuated VacA-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2-\u03b1 (Figure 5A and B) and CHOP mRNA expression (Figure 5C). More importantly, PERK knockdown decreased apoptosis (Figure 5D) and production of cleaved PARP caused by VacA treatment (Figure 5E and F). These results were further confirmed by employing an additional siRNA targeting PERK (Figure S2A, B, C, D). Next, we tested whether activation of ER stress occurs upstream or downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. If ER stress occurs upstream of mitochondrial damage, knockdown of PERK should inhibit VacA-induced Bax activation. In fact, PERK siRNA attenuated Bax activation induced by VacA plus NH4Cl treatment (Figure 5G). These data suggest that upon VacA treatment, especially in the presence of NH4Cl, ER stress leads to PERK-mediated CHOP induction followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to apoptotic cell death.",

VacA, one of the most important virulence factors of H. pylori, induces vacuolation and apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. Mitochondria serve as a target of VacA during apoptosis. The mechanism(s) underlying VacA effects on the mitochondria are unclear. It has been proposed that mitochondrial membrane potential is lost because of Bax induction, although the pathway leading to Bax activation has not been defined [13], [20], [41]. Others have suggested that loss of the membrane potential results from translocation of VacA to the mitochondria [12], [42]. The current study indicates that VacA induces ER stress in AZ-521 cells, consistent with previous reports demonstrating that other bacterial virulence factors including Shigella toxins and lipopolysaccharide provoke ER stress [43], [44]. Of note, some viruses and bacterial virulence factors trigger CHOP activation [44]\u2013[46], implying that CHOP may participate in the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases. The significance of CHOP in facilitating ER stress-induced cell death has been well documented, for instance, macrophages from CHOP knockout mice are more resistant to apoptosis induced by thapsigargin, an activator of ER stress [31]; further, indomethacin-induced apoptosis is attenuated in cultured guinea-pig gastric mucosal cells expressing a dominant-negative form of CHOP [30]. Fibroblasts from Bax\n\u2212/\u2212\nBak\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis, indicating a pivotal role for these pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins in ER stress-mediated cell death [47].

            "text": "Studies have demonstrated that NH4Cl enhances VacA-induced Bax activation and cell death [8], [18]\u2013[20]. In agreement, this study demonstrated that addition of 5 mM NH4Cl to incubation medium, a concentration often found in gastric juice of H. pylori-infected patients, significantly augmented VacA-mediated CHOP induction and apoptosis. Furthermore, CHOP was transcriptionally activated by PERK via phosphorylation of eIF2-\u03b1, which was also augmented by NH4Cl. Although it is currently unclear how NH4Cl increases VacA-induced ER stress, it is believed that VacA enters cells independent of ammonia [19], therefore, the effect of NH4Cl on apoptosis probably does not result from increased VacA entry into cells. We also note that the effect of NH4Cl on enhancing VacA-mediated ER stress and apoptosis may not be directly linked to enhanced vacuolation since CHOP induction upon incubation with VacA plus NH4Cl was not inhibited by Bafilomycin A1 (data not shown). These data support the prior conclusions that cytochrome c release and vacuolation are independent cellular outcomes of VacA treatment while both of these actions can be potentiated by the presence of NH4Cl in the culture medium [17], [20]. Our data showed that some ER stress markers including ATF-6 up-regulation and enhanced XBP-1 splicing were not altered by VacA treatment, suggesting that VacA in combination with NH4Cl does not broadly activate ER stress signals but rather specifically enhances PERK-CHOP signaling pathways. Interestingly, we did not observe increased expression of CHOP in human H. pylori-infected samples. The following possible scenarios are considered: persistent sub-lethal ER stress in human chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori might allow the cells to adapt for survival by retaining a minimal level of CHOP in vivo. In this respect, we observed up-regulation of cytoprotective GRP78 in VacA-treated cells as well as in human gastric mucosa infected by H. pylori. This ER-chaperone protein plays a critical role in a UPR-protective response and its up-regulation is commonly used as a sentinel marker of ER stress in various pathologic conditions [48]. Therefore, gastric cells may try to adapt to a toxic environment and UPR by increasing the content of chaperone proteins including GRP78. If ER homeostasis is not restored, apoptotic signals can be executed by activation of the PERK-CHOP pathway. Additional studies are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

            "text": "ER stress-mediated signaling pathways are coupled to activation of several death signaling molecules, which promote mitochondrial dysfunction [25]. Functionally, CHOP is known to up-regulate the BH3-only proteins Bim and PUMA and induce Bax activation [34], [35]. The role of BH3-only proteins in VacA-mediated apoptosis has not been explored, but VacA was reported to reduce expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that antagonize the activation of BH3-only proteins [49], and Wei et al. have shown that BH3-only proteins are up-regulated in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells [50]. In the current study, we found elevation of Bim and PUMA mRNA in human H. pylori-positive gastric mucosa, as well as transcriptional up-regulation of Bim in AZ-521 cells treated with VacA plus NH4Cl. Since knockdown of PERK decreased VacA-mediated Bim mRNA expression, activation of Bim likely occurred downstream of ER stress. Although further investigations are required to identify precisely how VacA-induced ER stress leads to activation of BH3-only proteins and Bax, it was recently reported that CHOP potentially cooperates with FOXO3a in neuronal cells to regulate ER stress-induced Bim expression [35]. Thus, it would be intriguing to investigate if FOXO3a also modulates VacA mediated-apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells.",
