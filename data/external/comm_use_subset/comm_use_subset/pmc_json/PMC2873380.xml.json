Such specimens are usually collected in hospital by certified nurses, pediatricians or other medical doctors, but parents may find it troublesome having to go to a hospital every time a specimen needs to be taken from a child with respiratory infection as such diseases occur several times a year. Collecting respiratory secretions at home could overcome this, but traditional collection techniques (mainly nasopharyngeal aspiration and nasopharyngeal washing) are too complex, invasive and time-consuming to be used by untrained people [10-12].",

The pediatrician and a parent (who was first asked to read a very simply written and illustrated description of the procedure) each inserted a swab gently up to its collar and rotated it three times before placing it in viral transport medium to be delivered to the laboratory within three hours. The parents were then asked to describe their child's satisfaction with the two procedures using a a five-point scale (from 5 for \"very satisfied\" to 1 for \"very unsatisfied\"); an independent observer (PM) confirmed that the child's satisfaction was as reported by the parents. There was no refusal to participate, all of the children had two swabs taken (one by the pediatrician and one by a parent), and a satisfaction scale was completed for each.",

Secondly, the samples can be obtained immediately after the onset of the first signs and symptoms, thus favouring the identification of the infectious agent and aiding treatment decision making after a pediatrician's visit.
