This uncertainty is reduced greatly once the basic reproductive number and the serial interval of infection are known. The basic reproductive number quantifies the transmissibility of a pathogen and is defined as the average number of secondary infections generated by one typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population. The serial interval in each infector-infectee pair is the time between disease onset in the infector and the onset in the infectee.",

We assumed that neither Tg nor R0 were known for an emerging pathogen and attempted to estimate them jointly for Scenario 1 (Fig 2c and 2d showed 8 arbitrary epidemics and prediction intervals of 100 epidemics) and Scenario 2 (Fig 3c and 3d showed 8 arbitrary epidemics and prediction intervals of 100 epidemics). Compared to the univariate cases, for both scenarios, reliable information was obtained on both R0 and Tg. However, prediction intervals were wider. Once the peak had been reached, the convergence of estimates of Tg in bivariate case were achieved, but in relative terms, the accuracy was considerably lower.",

Previous similar work [1, 2, 4] has incorporated either the initial stochastic phase or one or more of the deterministic phases, but not all phases together.",

In this model, the serial intervals are assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. When it has large variance and thus less distinguishable between generations of infection comparing to a shape Gamma distribution, the joint estimations have poorer performance, although they remain reasonably accurate in infinite population [3]. In finite population, the estimations of Tg^ showed no bias (Table 1) if it had sufficiently large seed size.",

Also, most pathogens generate some mild or entirely asymptomatic cases that would evade even the most intense surveillance efforts.
