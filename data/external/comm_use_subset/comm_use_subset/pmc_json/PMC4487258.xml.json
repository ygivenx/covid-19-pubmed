M. pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP in older children and young adults, while the incidence of infection in the very young and the elderly is on the rise [1\u20135]. For adults alone the annual economic burden of CAP is > $17 billion [6]. Macrolide resistance is a growing concern, particularly in children [5], and extra-pulmonary sequelae occur in up to 25% of infections. Finally, evidence continues to indicate a contributing role for M. pneumoniae infection in the onset, exacerbation, and recurrence of asthma [5].",

            "text": "An area of growing interest is the role of M. pneumoniae strain type in pathogenesis and disease epidemiology. Genetic diversity is relatively limited among M. pneumoniae strains, which can be categorized into two major groups (type 1 or type 2) based on variation within sequence of the P1 (MPN141) gene, although variant strains of the two are increasingly more common [7]. The P1 protein is an important virulence factor and immunogen in M. pneumoniae infection [8\u201310]. P1 must complex with several other proteins in order to localize to the tip of the terminal organelle, where it mediates receptor binding for attachment to the respiratory epithelium, an essential step in successful colonization of the airways [9, 11]. Variation in the P1 gene sequence is used to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 strains of M. pneumoniae, but little is known about phenotypic differences arising from this genetic variation. Perhaps notable in this regard is the periodicity of type-switching that occurs between the two major genotypes in regular patterns of four to seven years [12].",

            "text": "\nM. pneumoniae infection is transmitted through aerosolized respiratory secretions and spreads slowly but efficiently through close living quarters, with incubation periods up to three weeks [13, 14]. Symptoms tend to be non-descript, often with complex and variable clinical presentations, which makes definitive diagnosis challenging [2, 6, 15]. As a result, diagnosis is often presumptive and relies heavily on the combination of physical findings and the elimination of other possible causes [4, 5, 14]. The success rate for laboratory culture is poor, even for experienced labs, while serologic testing, historically considered the foundation for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, has limited sensitivity and specificity, a high tendency for false-negatives, requires paired sera resulting in retrospective diagnosis, and must often be paired with another diagnostic method [2, 4, 5, 10, 14]. Of the currently existing alternatives, the most efficient means for detection is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). At present, the only FDA-approved tests for the clinical detection of M. pneumoniae are the Illumigene automated detection system (Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Cincinatti, Ohio) and the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah). The Illumigene platform uses loop-mediated isothermal amplification and is capable of detecting M. pneumoniae in both throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel employs nested, multiplex qPCR with endpoint melt curve analysis on nasopharyngeal swabs to test for 21 different viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, and is capable of detecting M. pneumoniae as low as 30 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml [16]. The current standard for M. pneumoniae genotyping is PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, but can also be done by nested PCR and sequencing, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis, or by qPCR and high resolution melt curve analysis [15, 17\u201319]. These methods for detection and genotyping exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for all known strain variants, can allow for detection in the early stages of infection, and can be performed in hospitals and reference laboratories [2, 4, 5]. However, the requirement for separate tests for detection and genotyping, as well as the cost, complexity, and expertise required, limits the practicality for widespread, point-of-care use [2, 4\u20136, 14]. These limitations create a critical barrier to the accurate and timely diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection and epidemiological tracking, and a rapid, simple, diagnostic platform capable of simultaneous detection and genotyping would greatly improve the control of M. pneumoniae disease.",

Raman spectroscopy in particular has several advantages for application to biological samples, including narrow bandwidths, good spatial resolution, and the ability to analyze aqueous samples due to the absence of interference by water molecules [20, 21, 24]. Furthermore, Raman spectra provide detailed structural information on the chemical composition of a sample and can serve as a characteristic molecular fingerprint for pathogen identification [23, 24]. Despite these advantages, standard Raman spectra are inherently limited by weak signals for detection. As a result, the application of traditional Raman spectroscopy for biosensing applications was impractical and inefficient [13, 21, 24] until the discovery that sample adsorption onto nanoscopically roughened metallic surfaces results in significant enhancements in Raman signal and spectral intensity [23\u201325]. This enhancement, by factors up to 1014-fold, is attributed to the increased electromagnetic field for molecules in close proximity to the metallic surface [20, 21]. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) retains the advantages of standard Raman spectroscopy, in addition to markedly improved sensitivity, allowing for considerable success at whole organism molecular fingerprinting [20, 24, 26, 27].",

Initial evaluation of this biosensing platform\u2019s capabilities indicates the potential for application as a next-generation diagnostic tool for the clinical detection of M. pneumoniae, but a more comprehensive analysis is needed prior to proceeding with clinical validation. In the present study we further explored the specificity of NA-SERS for M. pneumoniae detection with a panel of 30 M. pneumoniae isolates collected from representative global outbreaks and spanning clinically relevant genotypes. Furthermore, since NA-SERS has inherent biochemical specificity, we analyzed a panel of 12 other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasmas to demonstrate that this biosensing platform could distinguish M. pneumoniae from its clinically relevant closest phylogenetic relatives. Finally, we evaluated the ability of the NA-SERS platform to correctly type the 30 M. pneumoniae clinical isolates relative to known reference strains of M. pneumoniae.",

P1 genotype groups were determined by the Pneumonia Response and Surveillance Laboratory at the CDC in Atlanta, GA using DNA sequence analysis, qPCR in combination with high resolution melt curve analysis, and RFLP sequencing analysis. All mycoplasma isolates and controls were cultured in SP4 medium [2, 30] in tissue culture flasks with a 1\u03bcl/ml inoculation and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Strains grown at UGA were harvested at log phase when the phenol red indicator turned an orange color upon reaching a pH of ~6.5. Strains grown at the CDC were harvested 14 days from the date of inoculation to ensure adequate growth for all isolates. At time of harvest, the spent growth medium was decanted for each flask and 0.1\u00d7 volume of sterile PBS (pH 7.2) was added to wash the adherent mycoplasmas. The PBS wash was then decanted and the PBS wash repeated 3\u00d7 before the cells were scraped into 1 ml sterile PBS. Cells were then syringe-passaged 10\u00d7 with a 25 gauge needle and aliquots made for determination of protein content, plating on PPLO agar [32] for CFU determination (for select isolates and controls), DNA extraction for genome equivalent determination, and SERS analysis.",

These included: Acholeplasma laidlawii (ATCC 23206), Mycoplasma amphoriforme (A39 M6123; provided by M. Balish, Miami University of Ohio), Mycoplasma fermentans (ATCC 19989), Mycoplasma genitalium (ATCC 49897), Mycoplasma hominis (ATCC Mh132), Mycoplasma orale (ATCC 23714), Mycoplasma penetrans (UAB reference strain collection, year 1995), Mycoplasma pirum (ATCC 25960), Mycoplasma salivarium (ATCC 23064), Mycoplasma spermatophilum (ATCC 49695), Ureaplasma parvum (Up1; ATCC 27813), and Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu11; ATCC 33695). Mycoplasma buccale, Mycoplasma lipophilum, and Mycoplasma faucium were originally intended to be included in the panel, but attempts at culturing these organisms were unsuccessful. For each culture, 500 \u03bcl to 1 ml of stock culture was inoculated into approximately 30 ml of SP4, Hayflick\u2019s, or 10B depending on the individual species\u2019 growth requirements, and incubated until the pH indicator changed color, indicative of microbial growth and utilization of the metabolic substrate in the media, i.e., glucose, arginine, or urea. At the time of harvest the cells and spent media were poured into 50 ml polycarbonate tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 RPM for 15 min, except for Ureaplasma species, which were centrifuged for 1 hr. The supernatants were decanted and the pellets suspended in 30 ml sterile PBS. The cells were washed by centrifugation at 8,000 RPM for 15 min as above, or 10,000 RPM for 1 hr for Ureaplasma species. The supernatants were then decanted and the pellets suspended in 1 ml sterile PBS, transferred to a 1.5 ml vial, and centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 20 min. The supernatants were again decanted and the pellets suspended in 1 ml sterile PBS and syringe-passaged using a 26-gauge needle to disperse clumps. Aliquots were made for spotting onto a blood agar plate to test for contamination, and plating for CFU and color-changing unit (CCU) determination. Two 400 \u03bcl aliquots for each were centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 20 min, the supernatant was removed, and the pellets were frozen for shipment to UGA, where they were stored at -80\u00b0C.",

CFU values were determined for both reference strains and six randomly chosen additional isolates to assess cell viability at time of fixation and ranged from 1x105 to 1x107 CFU/ml. Due to the propensity for mycoplasma cells to clump, a confounding factor in using CFU values as a metric for sample content is the potential discrepancy between CFU value and actual cell number, which can differ by as much as 103-fold [39]. Therefore, protein content and genome equivalents were determined in order to better define the content of the samples at the concentration analyzed by SERS. These values fell within comparable ranges and were consistent with published values for bacterial cells [40]. Protein concentration per cell was higher for M. pneumoniae isolates harvested during stationary phase relative to those harvested during log phase (growth phase based on the color of the pH indicator in the SP4 medium), but no notable differences in genome equivalents or SERS spectra were observed between M. pneumoniae samples relative to growth phase at time of harvest (data not shown).

PLS-DA is a full-spectrum, multivariate, supervised statistical method whereby prior knowledge of classes is used to yield more robust discrimination by minimizing variation within classes while emphasizing latent variables arising from spectral differences between classes [41, 42]. A PLS-DA model was generated to discriminate between three classes: the nanorod substrate background (Fig 2A); the growth medium control (Fig 2B); and all M. pneumoniae strains (Fig 2C). The inclusion of substrate background and growth medium controls allowed us to ensure that any differences in growth medium and nanorod background signal within the substrate did not affect the ability of the model to discriminate between the presence or absence of M. pneumoniae. Two nanorod substrates were used for these experiments, with each containing duplicate wells of the bare nanorod substrate, independently prepared M129, FH, and growth medium controls, and 15 additional clinical isolates of M. pneumoniae. A total of n = 390 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra collected from both substrates were included in the model, consisting of 20 nanorod substrate background spectra, 20 growth medium control spectra, 25 M129 spectra, 25 FH spectra, and 10 spectra per additional clinical isolate. The cross-validated statistics for the model show that NA-SERS correctly classified all 32 clinical isolates as M. pneumoniae regardless of global origin, year isolated, genotype, or macrolide susceptibility phenotype, and distinguished them from the substrate background and the growth medium control with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and specificity.",

An initial PLS-DA model was generated to discriminate between two classes, the nanorod substrate background and all other biological samples, which it did with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and specificity (data not shown). The purpose of this model was to ensure that the nanorod substrate background signal was significantly different than all other samples in order to exclude the background spectra from our future models. Once we determined that the nanorod substrate background class could be excluded, a second PLS-DA model was generated using the same spectra to distinguish among three classes; the growth medium control, M. pneumoniae, and the other Mollicutes species. This model had a total of n = 140 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra, consisting of n = 10 growth medium control spectra, n = 10 M. pneumoniae spectra, and 10 spectra each per other Mollicutes species. This model distinguished the three classes with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and specificity (data not shown). Upon the successful development of a PLS-DA model to distinguish between the growth medium control, M. pneumoniae, and all other Mollicutes species, a final PLS-DA model was generated using pre-processed NA-SERS spectra from all three nanorod substrates analyzed during these experiments. This model contained a total of n = 495 spectra, consisting of 25 growth medium control spectra, 25 M129 spectra, 25 FH spectra, 10 spectra each per other M. pneumoniae clinical isolates (30 isolates total), and 10 spectra each per other Mollicutes species (12 species total).

Our panel of clinical isolates contained three distinct and clinically relevant genotypes of M. pneumoniae: 13 type 1 strains, 11 type 2 strains, and six type 2 variant (2V) strains. M. pneumoniae strains M129 (type 1) and FH (type 2) were used as reference strain controls, as they have been previously applied in this manner for evaluation of M. pneumoniae genotyping assays [19].",

However, this model was built to discriminate between 3 classes, type 1 reference strain control, type 2 reference strain control, or type 2V clinical isolate spectra. A third class was necessary for classification of this genotype, as existing methods are capable of identifying variant strains as unique from type 1 and 2 isolate strains [18], and as such for clinical purposes NA-SERS typing should be able to do the same. PLS-DA correctly classified the type 1 reference strain control as distinct from the type 2 control and the type 2V clinical isolates with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and 98.8% cross-validated specificity (Fig 5A). Furthermore, PLS-DA distinguished the type 2 reference strain control from the type 1 control and 2V clinical isolates with a cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 90.6%, respectively (Fig 5B). Lastly, PLS-DA correctly classified all six type 2V strains as distinct from the type 1 and 2 reference strain controls with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and specificity (Fig 5C). The drop in sensitivity and specificity observed for the type 2 reference strain control is likely due to the fact that these are variant strains of the type 2 parent strain, and variant strains tend to be more similar to their respective parent strains genetically than either are to the opposite strain type [18, 37].",

Thirty PLS-DA models were built using the 25 type 1 M129 spectra and 25 type 2 FH spectra as reference strain control classes, and 10 clinical isolate spectra treated as an unknown class. For type 1 and 2 clinical isolates, two categories were used for cross-validation of the model, while for type 2V isolate strains, three categories were incorporated to cross-validate the model, as described above. For all clinical isolate types the model was cross-validated by using a Venetian blinds algorithm with seven data splits. These PLS-DA models were incorporated to simulate a potential strategy for future application of NA-SERS for M. pneumoniae genotyping wherein known strain type controls are used to predict the genotype of an unknown clinical sample. Full cross-validated statistics for all 30 PLS-DA models are given in Table 3 for all type 1 and 2 clinical isolates, and Table 4 for all type 2V clinical isolates. Overall, PLS-DA performance was consistent with the models shown in Figs 4 and 5. The only notable difference in performance was a decrease in cross-validated specificity in the individual modeling for type 1 clinical isolates K20, NM2, and FL1, but this likely arises due to the decreased sample size (n = 60) used to build the individual PLS-DA models.",

The majority of the spectral fingerprint was identical for all three strain types, which is to be expected since they are all the same species and classify as such in the PLS-DA models shown in Figs 2 and 3. However, several visible differences in band pattern were present in the spectra for each genotype of M. pneumoniae, which could account for the ability of NA-SERS to distinguish between the three genotypes with statistically significant sensitivity and specificity. The averaged type 1 spectrum had two unique peaks, one at 1636 cm-1 that does not appear in the averaged type 2 or 2V spectra, and one at 959 cm-1 which appeared as more distinct and shifted slightly right in the type 1 spectrum when compared to the type 2 spectrum, and did not appear in the type 2V spectrum. The averaged type 2 strain spectrum was very similar to the type 1 strain spectrum aside from the differences mentioned above and the presence of a doublet at 767 and 778 cm-1, which appeared as more distinct than that present in the type 2V spectrum and as a broad singlet in the type 1 spectrum. The averaged type 2V spectrum appeared to be the most distinct of the three, with a doublet at 875 and 890 cm-1 that appeared as a single peak at 890 in type 1 and 2 spectra, and a small peak at 521 that was also absent in type 1 and 2 spectra. While these spectral differences were extremely subtle, chemometric analysis is highly capable of discerning differences such as these with substantial discriminatory classification power [43].",

Briefly, homologous recombination within the p1 gene of repetitive element sequences located both in and outside the p1 gene contributes to sequence variation between strain types [7]. Nucleotide and amino acid sequencing of 60 M. pneumoniae isolates indicates that trinucleotide short sequence repeats (SSR\u2019s) coding for serine can be found in all strain types anywhere from 5\u201314 times, but appear to be most prevalent in type 1 strains [7]. Serine repeats may form a hinge structure and lead to downstream conformational differences in the P1 protein between the different strain types, which could potentially affect its interaction with the host as a surface antigen [45, 46]. In addition, 14 of the 60 isolates in the Zhao et al. study had point mutations in several variant strains corresponding to amino acid changes in P1 to glutamine, proline, asparagine, and isoleucine residues [7].",

However, PLS-DA classification performance diminishes as the number of classes in question increases, due to the underlying algorithms applied by the modeling, and as such, attempts to classify all 13 species within a single PLS-DA model failed to yield statistically significant accuracy. In order to overcome this limitation and address the question in a clinically relevant classification system, individual pair-wise PLS-DA modeling was employed. For this analysis, we chose to focus on the nine other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasma species most closely related phylogentically to M. pneumoniae. Individual PLS-DA models were built for each of the nine mycoplasma species to distinguish among three categories: the growth medium control (1), M. pneumoniae (2), or the mycoplasma species in question. Each model contained a total of n = 30 spectra, with 10 spectra representing each category. Furthermore, for each category eight of the 10 spectra were of known sample class, whereas two out of the 10 spectra were treated as unknowns and classified based on their resemblance to category 1, 2, or 3 spectra. Cross-validation of the prediction capability for each model was done using a Venetian blinds algorithm with five data splits. Models were designed this way to simulate the prediction of a potential unknown clinical sample as mycoplasma-negative, M. pneumoniae-positive, or positive for one of the other human commensal or pathogenic mycoplasma species. The cross-validated sensitivities and specificities for all nine models are given in Table 5. Overall, the cross-validated sensitivity and specificity was 90% or greater for all nine models, which is very promising for further application of NA-SERS for species-level discrimination and prediction.",

Serologic testing was historically the gold standard for diagnosis but suffers from severe limitations that make it both unreliable and impractical for rapid detection. Advances in qPCR technologies have overcome many issues with sensitivity and reliability, but the cost of reagents and requirement for technical expertise are still high, and independent tests must be done for detection and genotyping, limiting diagnosis by qPCR to hospital or advanced laboratory facilities and making it impractical for point-of-care use.",

Here, NA-SERS showed statistically significant specificity for M. pneumoniae detection regardless of clinical isolate origin, year of isolation, macrolide susceptibility phenotype, or strain type, and was also able to distinguish all M. pneumoniae clinical isolates and control strains from 12 other human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species. Furthermore, NA-SERS discriminated between the two major strain types of M. pneumoniae with a high degree of statistically significant accuracy and correctly identified variant strains as different from the two major genotypes. Most importantly, NA-SERS was capable of detecting and strain-typing M. pneumoniae within a single test and thus has the potential to facilitate tracking epidemiological trends, such as type-switching and outbreak periodicity [12]. Studies with clinical samples are ongoing, and the effect of the presence of a clinically relevant sample background, for example from a patient\u2019s throat swab, on the ability of this platform to identify strain types or distinguish M. pneumoniae from other human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species remains to be determined. Furthermore, assessment of alternative methods of chemometric analysis to account for the increased number of classes and modeling complexity for species-level discrimination by NA-SERS is necessary. In addition, future clinical application of this technology will require collection of a larger spectral library of isolates and background controls. However, from a point-of-care clinical standpoint, the ability to detect M. pneumoniae rapidly is critical to informing appropriate treatment regimens consistent with the responsible use of antimicrobials. This feature is underscored by the availability of handheld Raman instruments having the potential for point-of-care use [52\u201354]. In combination with the minimal sample preparation requirements and expedient detection, NA-SERS shows great promise as a platform for future application to point-of-care M. pneumoniae diagnostics.",
