            "text": "Influenza remains a global threat, particularly in the elderly who are at high risk for severe infection complications such as lung disease and influenza mortality (Mertz et al., 2013). However, the mechanisms involved in how severe influenza infection develops are not fully understood (Brandes et al., 2013). We and others have shown that homozygosity for a SNP (rs12252), the C variant of the interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 (IFITM3) gene, is greatly increased in frequency in patients with severe acute influenza, in particular in Chinese population where the frequency of this SNP is much higher than in Europeans (Everitt et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2017). The mechanisms underlying this are still not clear, however it is known that IFITM3 can restrict several virus infections in addition to influenza virus inclunding Dengue virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Hantaan virus (Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015). IFITM3 rs12252-C was also shown to be associated with severe avian influenza H7N9 and Hantaan virus infections in Chinese populations (Wang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Xu-Yang et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017); however this association was not observed in two studies on European cohorts (Mills et al., 2014; L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2016) or in a recent American study (Randolph et al., 2017). Previously this SNP was suggested to generate a truncated protein with a 21 amino acid deletion in the N terminus, but this has now been shown to be highly unlikely leaving the question of how rs12252-C alters IFITM3 still open (Everitt et al., 2012; Makvandi-Nejad et al., 2018).",

In contrast, we observed no significant differences in pdm09H1N1 specific antibody levels in our elderly cohort despite comparable distribution of IFITM3 genotypes. However, higher levels antibodies to pdm09H1N1 were observed in young CC carriers when compared to the elderly, but not in TT carriers, suggesting the loss of the potential compensatory effect in elderlies. It is worth noting that, the level of antibody to pdmH1N1 in individuals carrying heterologous genotype was significant lower than CC and higher than TT (but did not reach the significance) genotype in young adults at basal level, and there were no differences observed in elderly adults with all three genotypes. This may put older people with the CC genotype in a vulnerable position for severe flu infection, a question that merits further investigation. In addition, although the data (Figures 1A\u2013G) suggests that antibody levels in the CT young adult carriers is always between the CC and TT levels, with a closer association to TT levels, the limited number of donors in this study prevents us from drawing firm conclusions.",

A mechanistic study is needed in order to understand this potential strain specific association with IFITM3 genotype. We speculate the potential differences between different influenza strains in association with IFITM3 genotype could depend on sequencing variation of haemagglutinin that might affect its interaction to IFITM3. Additionally, the amount of infecting virus encountered at the initiation of the infection may play a role here.",

The differences between the two genotypes appeared again after 1 year of vaccination although the difference was less pronounced compared with pre-vaccination. Potentially the higher risk of influenza exposure created by having the CC genotype has resulted in more frequent exposure to influenza antigens in these individuals creating a more active phenotype in their pre-existing immune memory cells. This could be worrying for elderly CC carriers as immune responses to influenza virus could be more exhausted in these individuals due to more frequent exposure, therefore it would be even harder to generate effective immune responses to the influenza vaccine.
