            "text": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which excessive fat accumulates in the liver of a patient who does not have a history of alcohol abuse [1]. NAFLD is classified into two categories: simple steatosis, in which only steatosis is observed, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which, in addition to steatosis, lobular inflammation and liver cell injury are observed. Although the underlying mechanisms of disease progression remain poorly understood, the \u201ctwo-hit\u201d hypothesis described the pathophysiology of NASH [2]. Steatosis (a primary insult) can sensitize the liver to secondary serious insults including reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, gut-derived endotoxins, pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), resulting in NASH development [3]. NASH may develop into liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma [4]. The available treatment options for NASH include weight loss, dietary, and lifestyle modifications, use of insulin sensitizing, and lipid lowering drugs [5]. Furthermore, combinations of these approaches have also been tried for management of NASH [5]. Since NASH is a multifactorial disease, single target based therapy has limited implications.",

The edible buds and flowers could be made into liquor and tea in the folk diet [6]. At the same time, it could be used as medicine, cosmetics, ornamental groundcover, and so on [6]. The constituents of this plant have been previously investigated and shown to contain iridoid glucosides and polyphenolic compounds [7]. The main polyphenolic components in L. japonica are chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, flavoyadorinin-B, methyl chlorogenate, and protocatechuic acid, make great contribution to its special activities [7]. In current Chinese Pharmacopoeia [8], chlorogenic acid has been officially used as the indicator compound to characterize the quality of this herb. The modern pharmacological studies showed that L.\njaponica had wide pharmacological actions, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiendotoxin, antipyretic, and other activities [6]. Since 1995, Lonicera japonica has been listed in the Pharmacopoeia of the People\u2019s Republic of China [9], and made in some preparations to treat chronic enteritis, pneumonia, acute tonsillitis, nephritis, acute mastitis, leptospirosis in clinic. L. japonica also has been employed extensively to prevent and treat some serious viral diseases of human and veterinary, such as SARS coronavirus, H1N1 (Swine) flu virus [10]. In Chinese Pharmacopoeia, only the flowers and flower buds have been officially used as the active parts to treat diseases [8].",

It has also been reported that an herbal formula consisting of L.\njaponica attenuates carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in rats [12]; hepatoprotective potential of this plant could be considered. However, the possibility that L.\njaponica could prove beneficial in ameliorating NASH has not been previously explored. The use of a diet deficient in essential amino acids such as methionine and choline is a well-accepted model for inducing NASH, which recapitulates many of the features of this disease in humans, including a histologic picture that mimics that seen in human fibrotic disorders associated with hepatic lipid accumulation, and the presence of inflammation and oxidative stress [13]. To support the application of L.\njaponica in the treatment of NASH-like disorders, the study investigated the hepatotherapeutic effect of L.\njaponica in an animal model of methionine- and choline-deficient diet (MCDD)-induced hepatic injury and to elucidate the underlying mechanism involved.",

The flowering aerial parts of L.\njaponica were air-dried, pulverized to a coarse powder in a mechanical grinder, and passed through a 40-mesh sieve to get powdered samples. Powdered samples (5 kg) were extracted at room temperature thrice with 10 L of 95% ethanol for 48 h on an orbital shaker to make the ethanol extracts. The L. japonica ethanol extract (LJEE) was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to completely eliminate alcohol and lyophilized, yielding approximately 582 g of dry residue (w/w yield: 11.3%). LJEE was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until use and was suspended in distilled water. The content of chlorogenic acid in the samples was then analyzed using the Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The calibration equation of peak area against the concentration of chlorogenic acid was y = 6832.3\u00d7 + 117.2 (R2 = 0.9998).

The MCDD is a well-established and widely-used nutritional model of steatohepatitis that causes hepatic steatosis and inflammation that mimics NAFLD in humans [13]. In this study, mice consistently developed steatosis, ballooning injury, and inflammatory cell infiltration following the MCDD intake, which is in line with previous reports on this nutritional model of NASH [20]. The histopathological findings in liver of MCDD fed-mice were considerably ameliorated by LJEE treatment. We also found that the ALT and AST activities were markedly reduced in MCDD fed-mice treated with LJEE. AST and ALT are considered to be sensitive indicators of hepatocellular damage and within limits can provide a quantitative evaluation of the degree of damage to the liver [21]. These results indicate that LJEE attenuated the liver injury in an MCDD-induced NASH animal model.",

We found that LJEE produced pharmaceutical effects on hepatic cholesterol and TG levels. Several studies have suggested that hepatic lipogenesis is increased in hepatic steatosis, which may result from either increased TG synthesis, or decreased fatty acid oxidation, both leading to increased TG content in the liver [22]. DGAT2 is a microsomal enzyme that joins acyl-CoA to 1,2-diacylglycerol and thus constitutes the final step in TG biosynthesis [23]. Although MCDD promotes intrahepatic lipid accumulation through impairment of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion [24,25], the mRNA encoding genes related to lipogenesis, such as DGAT2, were suppressed in mice fed a MCDD [26,27], which is in agreement with our findings. Our results showed that DGAT2 expression in MCDD-fed mice was also decreased in the LJEE-treated group. These results demonstrated that LJEE induced down-regulation of lipogenesis-related genes to inhibit accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets via a decrease of TG synthesis in MCDD-fed mice. The microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP) is responsible for VLDL assembly and export from the liver, which probably contributes to the derangement of triglyceride metabolism [28]. However, reduced MTTP expression has been found in various mouse models of NASH [29,30]. Further direct studies are needed to assess whether LJEE alterations would suffice to correct for the defect. In addition, PPAR\u03b1 mRNA level was significantly increased in LJEE-treated MCDD-fed mice. PPAR\u03b1 plays a central role in the uptake and \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, especially in the liver, and has been reported to protect against MCDD or high-fat-induced NASH in rodents [31,32]. The beneficial effects of LJEE in the treatment of liver steatosis may be partly due to enhanced fatty acids oxidation in the liver.",

TNF\u03b1 is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in the progression from steatosis to NASH, and causes secretion of various other cytokines and chemokines [36]. Among these secreted cytokines, the most important one is TGF-\u03b2, which plays a pivotal role in hepatic fibrogenesis through hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation [37]. HSC activation by TNF\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 results in the expression and deposition of \u03b1-SMA and collagen [38]. TNF\u03b1 also modulates several matrix metalloproteinases that are involved in liver injury, repair, and remodeling, with MMP1 and MMP9 the most relevant MMPs with regards to liver disease [39]. The present study demonstrates that LJEE lowers mRNA levels of hepatic TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 that are otherwise higher following MCDD feeding. The increased expression of \u03b1-SMA and various extracellular matrix-related factors such as collagen I, MMP2, and MMP9 in the livers of MCDD fed mice were also diminished by LJEE treatment. Results from the present research suggest the attenuation of the second hit by LJEE improved liver inflammation and fibrosis induced by the MCDD.",

Increased JNK phosphorylation has been reported in NASH model mice, whereas p38 pathway remained unaffected by MCDD [42]. Our data, in full agreement with the published reports [43], demonstrated that MCDD has led to higher phosphorylation of JNK; treatment with LJEE decreased JNK phosphorylation in the NASH model mice. Although inhibition of p38 activation did show a clear association with the benefit effect of LJEE to attenuate hyperglycemia-affected renal dysfunction [15], our data showed that activation of p38 was affected by neither MCDD nor the LJEE administration. In addition, it has been reported that ERK MAPK pathway is not involved in MCDD-induced NASH, however its activation is reported to decrease DGAT2 expression; ERK activation is probably required for the treatment of the disease [42,44]. In this study, we demonstrated that LJEE increased in the extent of ERK phosphorylation, which may lead to increased regeneration of the liver and reduced fat accumulation and inflammation by decreasing the expression of DGAT2, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in NASH. These results suggested that the inhibitory effect of LJEE on the development and progression of NASH is apparently governed by the augmentation of ERK activity and attenuation of JNK activation.",
