However, effective vaccines remain a challenge as tested vaccines have not been able to confer sterile immunity against infection [19]. Current research on T. gondii vaccines only focuses on antigens expressed in the tachyzoite stage, which only induce partial protective immunity [20, 28, 38, 44]. The development of a variety of epitope combinations from different stages of the life cycle, including tachyzoites, bradyzoites (in tissue cysts), and sporozoites (in oocysts), are likely to induce full protection [2, 3, 4, 43]. With the development of bioinformatics, epitope vaccines are considered a novel immunization approach to prevent T. gondii infection. In addition, an appropriate delivery system of vaccines could increase the transfection efficiency of immune cells.",

Ideal attenuated vaccines could be engineered to have a limited capacity for replication and to deliver an effective antigen, while avoiding unwanted inflammatory responses [35, 39, 41]. Recombinant adenoviruses are some of the most intensively investigated vaccine carriers in many pathogenic infections, such as Ebola virus, HIV, and the malaria parasite [1, 11, 16, 32].

Interestingly, we found that IgG antibody in the intravenous vaccination group increased very sharply at first but slowly later on, even after the boost immunization. It should be considered that antigens that are transmitted to the bloodstream directly can induce strong immune responses in the early stage, but can also cause immune tolerance, explaining why antibody levels increase slowly in the following time [25].",

It should be noted that Ad-UMAS induced a slightly biased Th1-associated antibody response. It is known that production of IgG subtype is driven by cytokines secreted during cellular immune responses. Therefore, the presence of IgG1 and IgG2a indirectly suggests that the vaccination protocol also promoted activation of a cell-mediated response [12, 31]. These data suggest that Ad-UMAS immunization by the mucosal vaccination route was capable of eliciting similar systemic humoral antibody responses compared with those elicited by the intramuscular pathway in vaccinated mice.",

Therefore, vaccines capable of inducing strong local mucosal immunity represented by secretory IgA would be helpful in preventing T. gondii infection [9]. Our data indicated that T. gondii-specific IgA antibody responses in vaccinated mouse sera were elicited by i.n. and i.o vaccination of Ad-UMAS, which were significantly higher than those induced by other vaccination routes, confirming the ability of Ad-UMAS to induce strong mucosal immunity via the mucosal route.",

CD8+ T-cells can control the spreading and development of T. gondii infection in synergy with CD4+ T-cells [12]. In our study, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets from immunized mice were assayed by flow cytometry. There was a marked increase in the percentage of CD8+ T-cells in mice immunized with the Ad-UMAS vaccine via mucosal routes. Cytokines play a critical role in the activities of Th cells. As we know, Th1 cells are responsible for limiting tissue extension of the parasite through the production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 [15]. Our results show that in contrast with the blank control, high levels of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 were induced in mice immunization with Ad-UMAS especially treated intraorally and intranasally. However, there is no difference in IL-10 production between vaccinated and control groups. Additionally, splenocyte proliferation activity was significantly enhanced in mice immunized via oral and nasal routes. These results clearly suggest that mucosal vaccination with Ad-UMAS can significantly augment Th1-mediated cellular immune responses in which CD8+ T lymphocytes are considered as major effectors responsible for controlling parasite infection and secreting IFN-\u03b3 during the cellular response against toxoplasmosis.",

With the RH strain, it is easy to induce acute infection in mice through intraperitoneal injection with tachyzoites. The PRU strain is more likely to induce chronic infection in mice following intragastric administration with cysts [36]. In order to simulate acute and chronic infection in the host, mice were infected with the RH strain and PRU strain by different challenge routes. When challenged with lethal doses of T. gondii (1 \u00d7 103), all five groups immunized with Ad-UMAS had a prolonged survival time as compared with control mice. In particular, mice immunized intranasally and intraorally showed higher survival rates than with the other immunization routes. Since protection via vaccination was not 100% because the strain of the parasite has high mortality and the dose of RH parasites for immunized mice was larger, the optimal challenge dose should be determined in the future. Furthermore, the higher mucosal immune responses that were induced by intraoral and intranasal vaccination of Ad-UMAS may explain the significant reduction in the cyst burden in the mice immunized with Ad-UMAS intraorally and intranasally, which exhibited reductions of 75.3% and 78.6% of brain cysts, respectively.",

These studies found that different inbred strains of mice have markedly different susceptibility to T. gondii infection. These susceptibility differences may be due to differences in the virulence of the parasite itself or differences in the genetic make-up of the mice in terms of their immune response. In our study, only one inbred strain of mice was used for the experiment. It is therefore necessary to assess the different immunizations in different strains of mice in future research.",
