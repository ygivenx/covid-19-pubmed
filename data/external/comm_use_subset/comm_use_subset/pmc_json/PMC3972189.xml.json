Interestingly, most of the cases (up to 95%) do not have identifiable cause (essential hypertension). It is important to note, that there are effective treatments for hypertension, making it a relatively easily manageable disease, but there is no cure for it, which is probably related to the issue, that the very cause of the disease is not known. As a result, patients are treated and their blood pressure is kept at an acceptable level (target blood pressure is reached by medication), but their background pathology causing the hypertension may be unaffected.",

Nonetheless, these hypertensive patients already had a barely decreased ejection fraction compared to the healthy population and also featured slightly elevated NT-proBNP levels, suggesting that this population is at imminent heart failure. At this stage of the disease serum ACE2 activity was already elevated although it did not correlate with NT-proBNP levels. It appears therefore, that serum ACE2 activity is another biomarker of imminent heart failure in hypertension. Importantly, sACE2 may also be related to the cause of the disease. It can regulate (decrease) local angiotensin II levels, affecting vascular diameter (vascular smooth muscle located angiotensin receptors) and sympathetic tone (neuronal angiotensin receptors). It may also contribute to the synthesis of angiotensin peptides which may activate the Mas receptor, believed to be beneficial in hypertension. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings suggesting that serum ACE is a rate-limiting step in RAAS: endogenous inhibitors [31], such as serum albumin [32] effectively (>90%) inhibit circulating ACE activity in human.",

Previous animal data have shown that transgenic sACE2 overexpression in the vessels of SHRSP rats normalizes (reduces) high blood pressure [11]. Modulation of sACE2 activity in the nervous system (overexpression) also attenuated hypertension [12] indicating a possibly protective role of sACE2 in hypertension. Genetic inactivation of sACE2 was again found to be a negative regulator of the RAS in blood pressure control [11]\n[13]\n[14]. Moreover, genetic association studies have shown a strong association of sACE2 polymorphisms to hypertension in different human populations [5]\n[16]\n[17], although without reference to the actual effect of these polymorphisms on the circulating ACE2 activity. In this respect our study identified sACE2 activity as a biomarker in imminent human heart failure.",

In spite of increased soluble ACE concentrations soluble ACE activity did not change in the diseased populations (Figure 6A) suggesting effective therapeutical inhibition of ACE, besides to the recently shown stabilizing effect of serum albumin on ACE activity [30]. Regression analyses of ACE concentration with EF, ESD and EDD before and after CRT groups did not show any correlation in spite to the promising correlation between soluble ACE concentration and cardiovascular disease (Figure 6C\u20136H). Moreover, although ACE expression was lower in patients with heart failure before CRT, this general relationship disappeared after CRT, when an improvement was observed in the clinical parameters. These data suggested that ACE expression is not related ultimately to the clinical status and severity of heart failure.",

Many candidates were proposed, including peptides, enzymes, receptors of inflammatory system, changes in the extracellular matrix of myocytes, oxidative stress and neurohormones [27], [32]. Clinical biomarker testing related to HF is aimed to identify possible underlying causes, to confirm the presence or absence of HF and to estimate the severity and the risk of disease progression, according to the consensus document of The National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry of the US [33]_ENREF_30. An ideal biomarker does not only indicate the pathology but also takes elemental part of that. Our data suggest that sACE2 is involved in disease pathomechanism, it correlates well with disease severity and even with regression of the disease so it is a candidate for HF biomarker.",

We found that soluble ACE concentration decreases, while soluble ACE2 concentration increases in systolic HF suggesting an opposite change in the tissue located forms of these enzymes. These changes promote AngII formation in the tissues, contributing to AngII related pathologies. Therapeutical interventions leading to improvement of cardiac function reverse the changes in soluble enzyme concentrations (Figure 7). It is not clear yet, whether these changes are consequences of HF, or important contributors to the progression and reversion of the disease. Nonetheless, this latter is supported by the clinical effectiveness of ACE inhibitor drugs in the management of HF. Inhibition of the redistribution of ACE enzymes therefore represents a new therapeutic strategy to counterbalance tissue RAS activation.",

AngII is further metabolized to angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang-(1\u20137)) by sACE2. AngII binds to and activate the type 1 AngII receptors (AT1R), while Ang-(1\u20137) binds to and activate the Mas receptor. Levels of tissue located and soluble forms of these enzymes determine local levels of angiotensin peptides. We hypothesize that a significant redistribution of tissue and soluble ACE and ACE2 occurs in human heart failure which changes are reversible upon improvement of the cardiac function. In particular, sACE2 limits AngII levels under healthy conditions, resulting in a low level of ATR1 stimulation and high Mas receptor stimulation, a condition which is beneficial in cardiovascular physiology. However, ACE2 is probably re-distributed in imminent or definitive heart failure. As a result, its activity increases in the circulating blood, but decreases in the tissues. This result in higher local Ang II levels, higher AT1R stimulation and lower Mas receptor activation. These latter features being characteristic to heart failure.",
