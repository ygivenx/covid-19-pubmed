The viral genome encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2]. The S glycoprotein is a major envelope protein and interacts with the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for entry into the host cell [3]. This protein consists of the S1 and S2 subunits. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit mediates receptor binding, whereas the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion. DPP4 is expressed on a variety of human cells, including fibroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, and hepatocytes [4], as well as in the lung parenchyma and interstitium [5,6]. MERS-CoV is detected in respiratory secretions and the lower respiratory tract of the infected patients [7,8]. In the most severe cases of MERS-CoV infection, aggravating respiratory failure ultimately results in mechanical ventilation [9]. These observations suggest that the MERS-CoV virus primarily infects the human respiratory tract and replicates within the human airway epithelium [10,11].",

Furthermore, therapeutic effects of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies were evaluated in several animal models, including Ad5/hDPP4-trasduced mice, humanized DPP4 mice, and hDPP4-transgenic mice as well as hDPP4-knock-in mice, rabbits, and rhesus monkeys [17,21,24,25,26,27,28,29,30].",

In cynomolgus monkeys, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contained dose-proportional concentrations of systemically administrated antibody, and these concentrations were approximately 500-fold less than those in plasma [31]. Therefore, delivery of therapeutic antibody to lung tissues via inhalation has garnered considerable interest. Following delivery via the airway, cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody, accumulated in normal and cancerous tissues in the lung at a concentration that was twice that achieved after i.v. delivery [33]. In addition, recent studies showed that Fc fusion proteins and nanobodies are also efficiently delivered via the pulmonary route [34,35,36,37]. Therefore, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody may also accumulate at higher concentrations following delivery via a pulmonary route, suggesting higher efficacy. In order for this pulmonary delivery to be successful, the antibody must be sufficiently stable to resist denaturation during the process of nebulization.",

We defined CDRs according to the International Immunogenetics Information System (IMGT) and targeted Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, Met, Trp, and Tyr which were defined as hydrophobic amino acids in previous reports [41,42]. For the C-8 clone, the F29, Y32, I51, I52, F53, and F54 hydrophobic residues in HCDR1 and HCDR2 were selected for randomization (Figure 1A). These six residues were designed to encode the wild-type amino acid, Asp, Glu, or redundant amino acids depending on the degenerate codon in the first scFv phage-display library (Table S2). We preferred negatively charged amino acids to positively charged amino acids as lowering the isoelectric point of an antibody may reduce the non-specific in vivo clearance [43]. The randomized scFv phage-display library had a complexity of 2.6 \u00d7 109 colony-forming units, which exceeded the theoretical complexity of 1.3 \u00d7 105 on the nucleotide level. After two rounds of biopanning on recombinant MERS-CoV S RBD protein, we randomly rescued phage clones and performed phage ELISA. Eleven scFv clones showed reactivity to recombinant MERS-CoV S RBD protein similar to or higher than that of the original C-8 clone. The C-8-2 clone harbored F29E and Y32E replacements, while the other ten clones had only one residue replaced with either Asp, Glu, or redundant amino acids, depending on the degenerate codon. To test the stability of the C-8-2 clone during nebulization, a scFv-hFc fusion protein was prepared and subjected to ELISA following nebulization. The reactivity of C-8-2 scFv-hFc to recombinant S glycoprotein was much less affected by nebulization than that of C-8 scFv-hFc; however, the reactivity of the C-8-2 clone was somewhat reduced compared with that of the C-8 clone (Figure S3A).",

To deliver drug via the airways, an aerosol that contains the drugs is generated by a nebulizer [46]; however, the physical stress of nebulization often causes protein instability by affecting the integrity of the molecular structure, frequently resulting in fragmentation and aggregation [47]. Aggregation of therapeutic proteins is a major concern, as it contributes to immunogenicity, which frequently causes adverse events, such as decreased drug efficacy, infusion reactions, cytokine release syndrome, or anaphylaxis [48]. A vibrating mesh nebulizer, which was designed for protein delivery, generates limited variation on the temperature, concentration, and surface tension, and its effect on the stability of the protein is the least among nebulizers [49]. This type of nebulizer also produces uniform sized particles and flow rates, which are also beneficial in maintaining the stability of biological products [37].",

            "text": "To reduce the immunogenicity of therapeutic protein, maintaining the stability of the native protein conformation as well as minimal (or no) formation of high-molecular weight species are crucial [50]. Therefore, engineering of a protein to render it more stable for pulmonary delivery is important. In a recent study, a trivalent nanobody against RSV F protein (ALX-O171) was successfully delivered directly into the lungs by nebulization and neutralized RSV in newborn lambs [46]. In this case, the framework 2 region of the nanobody contained more hydrophilic residues that are not observed in human VH domains and thereby increasing the stability of the nanobody [37]. In this study, we focused on CDRs, as the sequences of the CDR loops are closely related to the folding stability of antibodies [51,52]. CDR loops frequently possess hydrophobic residues to facilitate high binding affinity; however, solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues also impact antibody stability and aggregation [53,54,55]. To increase solubility and counterbalance the impact of the hydrophobic residues required for antibody binding, solubilizing residues can be introduced either at the edges of the CDR loops or within the CDR [56,57]. Furthermore, negatively charged substitution mutations within CDRs can be used to prevent aggregation [58]. In our study, we employed both strategies and reduced the number of hydrophobic residues and increased the number of charged residues in the CDRs, resulting in successful enhancement of the stability of a MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody. The final optimized antibody, C-8-2-4B-10D, showed very limited protein aggregation after nebulization and its biological potency was well maintained after such delivery. Further, we expect that formulation with surfactants such as polysorbate may prevent aggregation of this antibody during nebulization. ",
