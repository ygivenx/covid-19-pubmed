Protein complexity and our naivety of sequence/structure/function interplay [2] hinder robust de novo design, although several designs have been successfully realized [3\u20135]. Thus, na\u00efve identification of protein sequences with novel functions, or even mutants with improved function, benefits from combinatorial analysis of many proteins. The efficacy of this approach is directly dependent on combinatorial library quality and the phenotype selection process. The essence of discovery and evolutionary efficiency is to intelligently search sequence space by identifying the effective extent and amino acid distribution of diversity (if any) at each site. Protein discovery and evolution must balance [6] variance sufficient for generation of novel function (dominated by intermolecular interactions) versus conservation sufficient to maintain a high probability of foldable stability (intramolecular interactions) [7]. This challenge is heightened in small domains [8] that have limited area for a binder interface and require mutation of a larger fraction of the molecule [9].",

Yet most synthetic scaffold libraries\u2013including affibodies [15], affitins [16,17], knottins [18,19], anticalins [20], Fynomers [21], Sso7d [22], and OBodies [23]\u2013are binary with a fully conserved framework and uniformly diversified paratope (Fig 1B). Note that different scaffolds use different uniform distributions including NNK codons [24] or complementarity biases [25,26] but generally lack sitewise variation. DARPin domain libraries have six sites with a uniform broad distribution and one site with N/H/Y diversity [27]. A hydrophilic DARPin library includes two additional sitewise diversities [28]. The most sitewise design in non-antibody scaffolds has been introduced in the type III fibronectin domain. Diversification of one, two, or three loops, [29,30] or the sheet surface, [31,32] of this 10 kDa beta sandwich has enabled evolution of binding to a host of molecular targets [30]. Antibody-inspired amino acid bias in putative hot spots has proven effective within fibronectin libraries [31,33\u201335]. Diversification of two loops is evolutionarily superior to one-loop mutation [36], and although diversification of the third loop (DE loop: G52-T56) is not requisite for high-affinity binding, [30,36\u201339] it can aid stability [37]. Current library designs randomize G52 with G/S/Y, S53-S55 with Y/S, and 12\u201322 sites in two other loops with a consistent distribution (30% Y, 15% S, 10% G, 5% each F and W, and 2.5% others except C). Sitewise design was extended beyond the DE loop using accessibility, stability, and homology data yielding nine different diversifications at 11 sites in addition to 12 sites with consistent complementarity-biased diversity [35]. Also, in an alternative paratope approach to engineering fibronectin domains, five sites were identified for three different varieties of constrained diversities (4\u20138 amino acids) in addition to 12\u201319 sites with the complementarity biased diversity [31]. While a variety of sitewise diversities have been implemented in the fibronectin domain, the evolved repertoires resulting from these libraries have not been broadly and deeply analyzed.",

The Fn3HP mutant was previously evolved for hydrophilicity to improve processing and in vivo biodistribution [50]. We posit that a broad repertoire evolved from combinatorial libraries for de novo discovery will exhibit sitewise complementarity-biased amino acid diversity in the binding hot spot [48,51,52], conserved wild-type sequence in the distal framework, and a gradient of diversification at intermediate sites including bias for conservation or interactive neutrality in proximal regions. This gradient is not purely spatial as protein structure and protein-protein interfaces are complex (Fig 1C). Moreover, for novel ligand discovery, the exact paratope is not known ahead of time, which blurs designed localization of a hot spot [51].",

Deep sequencing of evolved protein populations has proven effective for analysis of functionality landscapes for maturation of single protein clones [53], protein families [54,55], and antibody [56] repertoires. Here we apply deep sequencing to several high-throughput discovery and evolutionary campaigns to identify repertoires of evolved hydrophilic fibronectin domains. The results demonstrate a range of diversities and sitewise amino acid preferences consistent with a benefit of a gradient of sitewise constraint. A constrained library based on the observed evolutionary repertoire provides stable, high affinity binders directly without maturation, and the sequence analysis provides a metric to evaluate the balance of inter- and intra-molecular considerations in library design, which are quantitatively assessed.",

The pair of magnetic sorts was followed by a flow cytometry selection for full-length clones using the 9E10 antibody against the C-terminal c-MYC epitope tag. Genes were mutated via error-prone PCR with loop shuffling [37], then electroporated into yeast (EBY100) as previously described.

A high-affinity population included all clones exhibiting binding to 50 nM monovalent target assayed via flow cytometry. Herein, clones meeting these criteria are referred to as mid- and high- affinity binders, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed as previously described [60].",

In total, six pools of DNA were isolated and uniquely analyzed in association with generations one and two. Following plasmid DNA extraction, two rounds of PCR were completed to assemble the Fn3HP gene fragment with Illumina primers, index tags, multiplexing bar codes, and TruSeq universal adapter (S4 Table).

Analysis work flow for each of the six subgroups (e.g. na\u00efve, mid-affinity, high-affinity populations originating from first and second generation libraries) consisted of first identifying full-length fibronectin DNA sequences, isolating each of the three diversified loop regions, and, lastly, calculating the amino acid frequency at each site. Additional calculations were necessary for the mid-affinity and high-affinity populations to both remove statistically rare events and avoid overcounting dominant clones. The removal of background (i.e. the rarest 2% of sequences, as determined by the rarity of nonspecific binders) was a precaution taken when analyzing the mid-affinity populations to account for the rare non-binding clones inherently collected via magnetic bead sorting [59]. To address the potential detriment of overcounting within all binding populations, the sequences for each loop region were clustered based on 80% or greater sequence homology. For each cluster of similar sequences, the summation of the amino acids at each site were weighted by a power of one-half, then aggregated across all clusters. The resulting weighted sitewise amino acid values were used for frequency calculations. Statistical analysis was performed using two sample Student\u2019s t-test. Statistical significance was assessed while adjusting for familywise error rate using Bonferroni method, denoted at level \u03b1 = 0.005.",

After performing FoldX repair, random mutants were generated for each of the eleven structures by randomizing the BC, DE, and FG loop regions in accordance with the second generation diversity design scheme. At this point, baseline stabilities were individually calculated for each mutant. To analyze the stability impact upon residue substitution for each position in the diversified regions, all 19 natural residue substitutions were individually introduced to the random mutants. The change in stability (\u0394\u0394Gfolding) upon mutation was then calculated for each PDB structure\u2019s collection of mutants. This process was iterated (n > 50) until the \u0394\u0394Gfolding associated with each position and residue converged to within 0.2 kcal/mol for at least five consecutive mutants. At each site, the stability impact upon substitution to each amino acid was calculated, creating stability matrices for each starting PDB. The sequences corresponding to the wild-type structures were aligned to account for loop length diversity. Average \u0394\u0394Gfolding values were calculated for all 20 amino acids at each diversified site (S3A Table).",

The site-specific exposure score is calculated as the product of the solvent accessible surface area [35] and an estimated likelihood of residing at the target binding interface. The latter was quantified on a sitewise basis, averaged across eleven Fn3 crystal structures, using a geometric algorithm. Using Python, the fibronectin orientation that presents maximal diversified surface is identified as follows. BC, DE, and FG loop residues are mutated to alanine to remove wild-type residue size bias. The area of accessible (i.e., visible in a two-dimensional projection as a planar approximation of the interface) diversified surface is calculated for each rotational orientation of fibronectin. The orientation that maximizes accessible view of the paratope, as well as any orientations within 5% of this projected area, is identified starting with a coarse-grained search and optimizing with a fine-grained search. For each site, the maximum area of accessible side chain surface within this set of optimized orientations is calculated. This calculation is repeated for all sites. Sitewise values are averaged across all Fn3 PDB models.",

At site 29, the more hydrophobic A was enriched (42% to 56%) whereas the more hydrophilic S and T were depleted (22% to 12% and 34% to 26%, respectively) but still frequent. Thus, second generation design maintained a distribution of AST. Y31 was enriched from 12% to 17% in binders. Glycine, which occurs with 31% frequency at this site within natural sequences of homologous proteins, increased in prevalence from 40% to 56%. Substantial decreases in S (18% to 9%), N (8% to 3%), and C (7% to 2%) were observed. The second generation library contained GY diversity. Wild-type G52 was enriched (35% to 57%) whereas S was depleted (23% to 11%). Wild-type conservation appears strongly beneficial at site 52. At sites 53\u201355, Y and N were enriched or maintained whereas S was depleted, but still present at reasonable levels. Thus, the second generation library implemented YNST diversity at these sites. T56 exhibited similar results without S depletion leading to TYSN design. At FG loop site 76, enrichment was observed for both wild-type T (34% to 41%) and S (26% to 32%) whereas N (10% to 3%) and Y (8% to 3%) were depleted in binders. Thus, the next design included T and S as well as the other small mid-hydrophilic G and A. At site 79, wild-type G was enriched (22% to 31%) as was S (19% to 27%). D (19% to 20%) was maintained but C (13% to 5%), Y (11% to 5%), and N (15% to 9%) decreased. Thus, GSDN diversity was used in the second library. Wild-type S85 maintained (62% to 65%), which prompts future conservation. At site 86, N was mildly decreased (48% to 40%) while S increased from 23% to 28% and Y decreased from 10% to 5%. The second generation design was intended to be NS but was erroneously synthesized as conserved N.",

The FoldX algorithm [68,81] was used to predict each site\u2019s tolerance to mutation. The change in stability (\u2206\u2206Gfolding) upon mutation across >500 theoretical library variants (see Materials and Methods) was predicted for each of the twenty amino acids at each site. The mutational tolerance was assessed in terms of the number of minimally destabilizing (\u2206\u2206Gfolding < 0.75 kcal/mol) amino acid substitutions allowed at each site. Observed amino acid diversity (Shannon entropy) in evolved binders correlated with computational mutational tolerance at exposed sites (Fig 7B).

The first two elements\u2013frequency in natural homologs and computational stability\u2013provide sitewise amino acid distributions; complementarity bias provides a single site-independent amino acid distribution; and the fourth element\u2013residue exposure\u2013provides a sitewise weight. We examined the ability of these four elements to combine to generate sitewise amino acid distributions that matched the experimentally observed frequencies. The relative weights of the first three elements were allowed to vary for each site based purely on the fourth element: solvent and target accessibility of that site (Eq 1). Sitewise frequencies in natural homologs were calculated from 58,058 homologs from the Pfam database [82]. Sitewise computational stabilities were calculated using FoldX as described above. Complementarity bias was calculated as the amino acid distribution observed in expressed human and mouse antibody CDR-H3 sequences [83]. Solvent accessibility is the relative solvent accessible surface area [84] of each side chain averaged over 11 fibronectin structures. Target accessibility was scored based on the orientation of the amino acid side chain relative to the rest of the diversified paratope (detailed in Materials and Methods).",

Weights were calculated for both an exposure-dependent and exposure-independent term, which were summed. The weights provide a relative comparison of the predictive value of each parameter. To evaluate the predictive value overall, the parameters were compared to an unbiased control input matrix (uniformly 5% of each amino acid). Weighted inclusion of all elements yields a library design that matches the experimentally evolved distribution 22 standard deviations superior to designs based on unbiased input matrices (S3 Fig). For well-exposed sites, amino acid diversity is effectively mimicked by 62% complementarity bias, 30% stability computation, and 8% natural frequency (Fig 9). At sites with less exposure, natural amino acid frequency should be more heavily weighted at the expense of stability and, less so, complementarity. Design based on a single element is inferior to randomness for stability, marginally effective (2 standard deviations above random) for natural frequency, and strongly effective (16 standard deviations above random) for complementarity. In short, the evolved repertoire correlates strongly with complementarity and moderately with computed stability and frequency in natural homologs, varying dependent upon sidechain exposure.",

Moreover, the location of the hot spot can differ across different epitopes being targeted by a scaffold. These peripheral sites can (a) directly contact target, (b,c) impact neighboring residue orientation to improve interfacial enthalpy or reduce entropic penalty upon binding, and/or (d) stabilize the protein. Yet these potential benefits can be offset by the inverse impacts: make unfavorable interfacial contact, worsen neighboring residue orientation, and/or destabilize the protein. If sufficient \u2018hot spot\u2019 interfacial area is not yet present for high-affinity binding, then additional sites must be diversified to enable favorable interaction. At some point, this expanded paratope provides sufficient interface for strong, specific affinity. Similar tradeoffs can be considered for peripheral sites. Given the typical detriment of random mutation, [88\u201390] the average peripheral mutation will hinder all four elements thereby suggesting against diversity. Though as a corollary, on average, mutations in the \u2018hot spot\u2019 will negatively impact the last two elements by worsening the entropic penalty upon binding and destabilizing the protein because of imperfect interactions with the conserved peripherals. Thus, peripherals need to be chosen to make neutral to good contact with: (a) intermolecular target; (b,c) intramolecular neighbors involved in binding; and (d) all intramolecular neighbors. For a-c, since beneficial interactions will be unlikely, amino acids\u2013such as serine [25,72,91]\u2013that yield relatively neutral interactions may be wise. For d, beneficial interactions are likely for the wild-type residue and conserved neighbors based on their coevolution so conservation should be the aim. Since the precise locations of the hot spots and these transitions will vary for each new ligand-target interface (Fig 1C), we hypothesized the evolved repertoires will exhibit a gradient of diversity from extensive diversity in the potential paratope hot spot to full conservation in the framework. Importantly, this gradient includes moderate diversity, with structural bias, within the paratope interfacing with target yet peripheral to the hot spot. Moreover, more mild diversity is included adjacent to the interfacial residues to yield optimal intramolecular contacts with the newly identified paratope. The range of Shannon entropies (Fig 7) and amino acid frequency distributions (Figs 2 and 5) across many binding sequences against several targets support the benefit of a gradient of diversities within combinatorial libraries. The particular amino acid distributions support the hypothesized benefits of wild-type conservation, serine bias, and complementarity bias, at appropriate sites.",

Trimer phosphoramidite codons can be used in oligonucleotide synthesis, [14] which enables precise control over each distribution but elevates synthesis complexity and cost. Independent oligonucleotides can be synthesized for each loop sequence, which further elevates control by enabling pairwise (and higher order) site design albeit at an elevated synthesis scope. Simpler, less expensive single-nucleotide mixed degenerate oligonucleotide synthesis can approximate many amino acid distributions, especially with the inclusion of unbalanced nucleotide frequencies as used in this study. The amino acid distribution within antibody CDR-H3 can be closely approximated by unbalanced single-nucleotide methods [35], but it must compromise on the genetic code connectivity of glycine, tyrosine, and cysteine. Achieving the desired high frequencies of tyrosine (20%) and glycine (16%) yields much more cysteine than desired (10%). In these libraries, we opted to maintain high tyrosine (17%) while limiting cysteine (5%) at the expense of low glycine (4%). Wild-type glycine bias at sites G52 and G79, as well as G77 in the second generation library, enabled this successful compromise as glycine at fully diversified sites was only marginally enriched in binders relative to the original library (2.7% to 4.0% in the first generation; 3.8% to 4.7% in the second generation). Thus, selective sitewise bias is able to effectively provide the evolutionary benefit of the presence of glycine within the DE and FG loops.",

The cross-validation test set consisted of a single sequence cluster that had been excluded from the training set analysis. Each sequence within the test set was assigned a probability for being observed within the original library (Pnaive) and the training set (Pevolved). Log-odds score, log(Pevolved/Pna\u00efve), histograms are shown for test set sequences (A) and further evaluated on a sitewise basis (B).",
