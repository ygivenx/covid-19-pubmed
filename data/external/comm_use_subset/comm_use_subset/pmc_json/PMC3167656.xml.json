Many different mathematical and statistical techniques have therefore been proposed1, 2 to analyse incoming disease incidence reports and detect a signal that is distinct from the unavoidable noise as early as possible after the onset of any event. However, the possibilities are far from exhausted and we have not yet developed a demonstrably reliable early detection method. The availability of better methods will invariably lead to enhanced biosecurity and help government, policy makers, and safety professionals in general to provide more effective strategies to ensure public health and safety.",

            "text": "For some diseases of greatest concern, the problem of outbreak detection is mathematically easy: a single case can constitute an outbreak (for example, smallpox), and for diseases for which this is the case, our efforts are geared towards early biological detection and identification of the single case, rather than mathematically or statistically identifying an impending epidemic. However, for the vast majority of diseases, including those responsible for frequent and/or periodic epidemics and severe mortality (for example, influenza, which claims B36 000 lives a year in the United States under normal, non-epidemic conditions3, our concern in biosurveillance and outbreak detection is rather focused on finding ways to detect unusual patterns of disease incidence soon after they begin to break from what is expected, typical, or endemic. This brings us to our first challenge in modern biosurveillance: the definition of \u2018an outbreak\u2019. A large part of the effort for a number of diseases is already spent in making the decision of what constitutes an unusual pattern.4 Most modern disease surveillance systems rely on static thresholds for outbreak detection. Outbreaks are declared once a sufficient number of new cases are reported over a certain period of time, within the confines of a certain location. The determination of these thresholds (that is, how many cases, over how long a period of time, within how much space) relies on historical incidence data to set an expected baseline for \u2018normal\u2019 conditions. This approach is instantly problematic when the disease of concern has never been observed within the population at risk, which means that no baseline can be established; however, it also poses other challenges. No two outbreaks are ever identical, even once corrections are made for population size, demography, and preexisting protective immunity. Similarly, endemic (or non-outbreak) disease occurrence can fluctuate for a variety of reasons (for example, known seasonal patterns). This means that there are large challenges involved in both determining what is normal and determining what is unusual. Methods from the fields of operations research and traditional statistics have helped somewhat, although the usual goal in operations research is to detect an event exceeding the \u20183 sigma\u2019 threshold of detection, based on the likelihood and frequency of the occurrence.5\u20137 In biosurveillance, however, the likelihood and frequency of an event of interest are not actually determinants of concern. Even if local outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome or Ebola haemorrhagic fever became frequent, and even expected, it would still be a logical requirement of any biosurveillance system to detect these events as soon as possible.",

This implies a requirement for much greater richness in historical data. If not all possible paths for the spread of infection have occurred within the period for which historical records are used for comparison, these methods may be unable to classify an outbreak simply because the trajectory of increased incidence is unfamiliar. Naturally, the number of different possible trajectories is much larger than the number of different current threshold scenarios, requiring a much longer and richer historical data set before a meaningful baseline can be set than would be required to detect outbreaks were all trajectories naturally identical. Hybrid systems, separately using both current threshold violations and adaptive trajectory responses, have solved some of these problems. (For example, when shifts in health-care utilization during epidemics and major public events are expected, an integrated network model of epidemiological data streams might have the potential to improve localized outbreak detection.9",

Even if we assume that, for each disease, we have a very good definition of what constitutes normal, endemic levels and what should constitute an outbreak worthy of our attention, various incredibly complex challenges remain. This brings us to our second challenge: heterogeneity in the sources of data. Diversity in incoming data provides a multifaceted source of information, and also challenges any system by providing variation in the timing and scale of reported incoming values. For example, daily, weekly, and monthly counts of cases may be reported as signals of the same disease, covering the same population. As we develop truly multifaceted sources of input into detection systems, involving data from such varied sources as medication sales, hospital admissions, doctors visits, web queries, and school or office absenteeism, integrating signals requires compensation for the existence of single cases contributing to multiple signals, not always simultaneously. Furthermore, not all of these signals will have equal significance to outbreak detection, nor is it reasonable to expect that actual incidence of infection will be the only factor affecting their dynamics.",

Different diseases will require different lead times in order to allow officials to mount effective and appropriate public health response measures. However, common to all possible outbreaks is the desire for reliable outbreak detection as early as can be managed. Naturally, making the system reliable is one of the key constraints against providing the earliest possible warning of a coming problem. A system that routinely issues false alarms is potentially even more harmful than a system that fails to notice an outbreak until it is already past its epidemic peak. Finding an appropriate balance between sensitivity and specificity is the last great challenge to the creation of effective measures in outbreak detection.",

In analyses of time series data, representing both noise and a signal, or a composition of a baseline endemic level with embedded epidemic curve, the use of moving averages, adaptive thresholds, cumulative sums, etc. aims to separate a noise from a signal by removing underlying trends of a presumably \u2018known form\u2019. For example, in fitting a harmonic regression to a time series of disease counts with well-pronounced seasonal oscillations,21, 22 it is assumed that a trajectory can be approximated by a periodic cosine function. Thus, the removal of underlying trends can be advantageous in removing expectations based on preexisting knowledge, and can also be misleading if the \u2018known form\u2019 is chosen incorrectly. In reality, the rationale for the removal of expectation might be questionable: just because we expect a specific pattern does not mean our algorithms should not detect it as an aberration or an outbreak. We may be compromising our algorithms\u2019 sensitivity arbitrarily, when instead we should be using human decision making to complement the system, and know when to adjust for or throw away an \u2018expected pattern\u2019.

The more rapid the detection goals, the shorter the temporal scale of data collection and reporting required to support those goals. This implies that weekly or daily data itself may soon be insufficient for desired detection and response, requiring instead hourly reporting. In replacing the surveillance standard of weekly reporting with a shorter response time, a wide range of factors have to be taken into account. Dealing with daily reporting requires an understanding of the effects that the day of the week, scheduled social activities, and holidays might have on the expected temporal pattern. For example, depending on the type of hospital admissionFemergency, in-patient, or outpatient careFthe effect of the day of the week on baseline disease patterns can be different.

However, the detection of events that are rare or have never been observed poses a challenge for model specification. Most existing models rely on a gradual change in numbers of observed events and are not adapted for data exhibiting a sudden spike in case numbers at an unexpected point in time.27 The nature of emerging health threats requires more sophisticated methods that are sensitive to rapid change and capable of taking into account specific features of an anticipated outbreak (for example, see Martinez-Beneito et al.28).",

Where did symptoms first manifest? Where was health care provided? How were these important spatial identifiers collected, stored, shared, and interpreted? Answers to these questions have become increasingly important. In many surveillance systems, the location of a patient's residence is often used as a proxy for exposure and transmission, which is often a wrong assumption. In instances in which detailed geo-referenced information is available, traditional analytical tools have a limited capacity to use such information effectively, as many of them were developed before complex interlinked geographical information could be routinely collected. New methods have to take into consideration non-euclidean topologies of an outbreak signature. Such topologies are very likely to be observed in spatio-temporal patterns of disease when transmission is amplified by transit, for example, in air travel connecting hubs at non-geographically adjacent places. Complex spatial patterns of geo-referenced exposure\u2013transmission\u2013detection pathways have to be better understood to guide the design of adaptive surveillance systems.

In that case, we may benefit by enhancing the sensitivity of our surveillance in areas in which we know these pathways exist (for example, it may make sense to monitor regions with particular native animals for certain zoonotic infections more closely); and (b) potential result: It may be that we would benefit by focusing on particular populations (for example, the immunocompromised or elderly) for which there is heightened concern based on a lack of herd immunity, the potential for extreme adverse outcomes, or other potentially compromising characteristics. This perspective has been already incorporated into public health planning, but has not yet been incorporated directly into surveillance methods. However, more intriguingly, we can push this idea even further by sliding the sensitivity of our outbreak detection algorithms to reflect areas in which we believe that curtailing an outbreak may be most effective if we identify it sufficiently rapidly. This may even come at the expense of sensitivity in areas in which we understand that we will never have enough advanced warning to effectively alter the course of an epidemic, and could lead to vastly different but more practical and efficient systems. Rather than curtailing the transmission of disease in certain areas, we may aim instead to improve the capability of providing sufficient medical care for all those affected (for example, surge capacity). The possibilities are vast and unexplored. We believe that this more complex goal for outbreak detection algorithms may lead to very different surveillance systems from those already in use.",

However, we believe that the most effective systems will integrate the input of computational tools with that of human decision makers. Autonomous components of a surveillance system could constantly analyse and organize vast quantities of otherwise overwhelming data, and present the results to a human analyst in ways that may highlight possible anomalies, allowing the analyst to decide which of these directions may be most valuable to pursue. Novel methods for such tools are currently under development within the newly rising field of visual analytics (http://nvac.pnl.gov/, http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/vaccine/research/vaat.php),16,30 and we eagerly anticipate further developments in these areas.

As with many fields of data mining, we believe that there may be vast, untapped potential in the idea of using historical data, not to set thresholds (whether static or dynamic), the violation of which would constitute an outbreak, but instead as training data, that is, data used for sensitivity calibration by a detection algorithm. By introducing concepts of machine learning, it may be that we can allow software to decide where the most useful signals of incipient outbreaks lie in the available data. This can be carried out by providing only the data and points in time during which human analysts concluded \u2018manually\u2019 that outbreak conditions were present. Using these methods may lead to surprising and counterintuitive definitions of an outbreak (perhaps having nothing to do with any signal of understood biological relevance). Yet, for practical purposes, it would be unlikely to matter, so long as the detection algorithm arrived at by the autonomous system provided consistent, sensitive, specific warnings of coming outbreaks.",

As the heterogeneity of data sources increases, it may be that a similarly automated dynamic weighting method for assessing the relative contribution to overall signal strength from each data source could lead to a far more sophisticated and sensitive system for outbreak detection. Again, along the same lines, the underlying topology of data sources could be autonomously explored, allowing clustering algorithms to be applied over different configurations of both time and space. These methods could reveal previously concealed travel patterns, or mechanisms of contaminationFor even perhaps cultural similarities that enable enhanced transmission of an infectious agent. Each of these potentially critical facets, contributing to the spread of infection, would need to be understood and defined manually under the current detection systems; however, by allowing dynamic methods of ongoing machine learning to operate, we may be able to enhance our ability to detect outbreaks while potentially furthering our understanding of the contributing factors driving the disease dynamics. A fully autonomous system, allowed to learn by continual, dynamic exploration of the complete space of incoming surveillance data, could be a prototype for a very powerful self-organizing surveillance system.
