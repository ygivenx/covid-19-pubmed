The gaps identified in current literature include a lack of information on what SADC does specifically to advance regional health governance and Southern regional health diplomacy. We argue that SADC can play a more significant role in health diplomacy and governance in the Global South, through engagement with regional social and health policies. The article shows this possibility by first describing the global principles of health diplomacy and niche diplomacy. It further describes what role SADC plays in health governance in the region and finally shows how SADC can play a stronger role in facilitating and coordinating health governance and diplomacy through social policy, based on the potential capacity it has as a regional organisation.",

Regional organisations and regional social policy feature substantially in social policy literature which considers the role of regional organisations as global players and training hubs (Riggirozzi, 2012; Van Langenhove, 2012). Regional organisations contribute significantly to regional social policy and programmes; for example, Latin American regional organisations have contributed significantly to transnational cooperation with regard to health surveillance and labour migration (Deacon et al., 2010; UNU-CRIS, 2008). Regional social policy literature has focused on cross-border redistributive programmes (including employment projects, food programmes and social protection funds), policy harmonisation and provision of services (Deacon et al., 2007: 4; Te Velde, 2006).",

PEPFAR is arguably the largest intervention ever undertaken by a single country to address a disease. PEPFAR positioned the US government as a major supporter of activities to counter AIDS in the Global South.

Brazil also formally recognised the right to health in the Brazilian constitution and made health a central foreign policy theme. When antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment became available in 1996, the Brazilian government pushed for access to ARV drugs for all HIV-positive people in the country. Brazil worked closely with other countries in the Global South, including the Treatment Action Campaign, to grant licences for local generic production of ARV drugs, despite being in breach of the Agreement on Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Brazil also participated in the FCTC, providing leadership and support for the initiative (Alcazar, 2008; Fourie, 2013).",

The \u2018sectoral responsibility approach\u2019 resulted in decentralisation of the structure and the creation of the secretariat in Gaborone, Botswana (Ostergaard, 1990; Schoeman, 2002). The SADCC was viewed as a \u2018service organisation\u2019 rather than a regional leadership body. This structure made sense politically, however, as each state was enabled to contribute equally to development across the region. SADC (1992) grew out of the SADCC in 1992 and was restructured again in 2001. The SADC Secretariat was established in 2001 to centralise the governance processes of each member state, whereas previously each member state had been responsible for a sector, as noted above. The restructuring process created complications in trying to assign responsibility for sectors to specific programmes housed at the Secretariat (SADC, 2014; Schoeman, 2002).",

Millennium Development Goal 8 (MDG8) to develop a global partnership for development in the SADC region identifies this decline. ODA has decreased despite the high debt burden in the SADC region. Aid dependence in the region was at the same level in 1999 as it was in 1980. Figure 1 shows the levels of ODA, public expenditure on health and total bilateral flows from donors in Southern Africa (African Development Bank, 2014) The graph indicates a slight increase in public expenditure, with fairly significant decreases in ODA.

External finance and foreign aid have encouraged transformation within SADC (with support in particular from the EU, Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland) (Gray, 2013; Tjonneland, 2006). External funding in the SADC region in 2013 amounted to US$67,600,000 for a total of 58 projects (Gray, 2013). The Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) is said to emulate EU policies of integration and development and is determined by the material dependence of SADC on the EU (Lenz, 2012). As such, donors and governments work together to develop SADC-specific policies and protocols, identified in the next section, which are the foundation for regional health governance in Southern Africa. Perhaps this support is still what SADC requires as a regional organisation.

White and Banda provide an exemplary explanation on the role of central civil society organizations (CSOs) in health governance, suggesting that CSOs have a better picture of human and technical needs and capabilities. Partnering with communities has the potential to increase returns on health and agriculture. CSOs can also play a role in disease surveillance. The example provided refers to the monitoring of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak since the Chinese government was not willing to disclose the magnitude of the outbreak, leaving the WHO reliant on non-governmental organisation (NGO) and CSO reporting on epidemiological information (White and Banda, 2006). The UN High Level Panel on Civil Society also advocates for increased cooperation between government and civil society.

This is also suggested by the Institute for Security Studies, who recommend the need for allocated funding in developing countries (Institute for Security Studies, 2014). This pertains specifically to the SADC region and the SADC Secretariat should heed these recommendations. In order to do this, the SADC Secretariat should consider integrating with a regional economic and trade regime and generating further support for states to maintain health systems. This takes into account the tripartite free trade discussions which occurred between SADC, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community (EAC) in 2012 and the final communiqu\u00e9 between the first COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite Summit in 2008 (SADC, 2012c). Health-promoting trade must facilitate equitable outcomes of private and public health services. This will become imminently more possible when SADC strengthens its negotiating power and capacity in trade frameworks, challenge global trade regimes which exclude Southern interests, build non-economic and trade regimes within the region that drive internal growth, and strengthen global integration terms for the Southern African region.",
