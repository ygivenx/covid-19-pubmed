Since the discovery of MERS-CoV in 2012, MERS-CoV infections have been detected in 23 countries with local transmission occurring in over half of the affected countries [1]. Although the mortality rate is high (about 40%), subclinical infections may be more prevalent than severe disease, which occurs mainly in elderly individuals and those with pre-existing conditions. Serologic, genetic, epidemiological, and animal infection studies indicate that dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) serve as a reservoir for human infection [2\u20134]. Seropositive assay results have been obtained from DC samples collected throughout the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa, including regions where no human cases have been detected [5], however, assay results may be impacted by the presence of cross reactive coronavirus antibodies [1]. Experimental infection of DCs resulted in a self-limiting upper respiratory infection with viral shedding occurring primarily through nasal secretions [2].",

To characterize the genetic variants present in nasal swabs from camels experimentally infected with a low passage human MERS-CoV isolate, we amplified a majority of the MERS genome using multiplexed RT-PCR assays and sequenced the products at high depths of coverage. The data generated from this analysis indicate that high frequency intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) occur throughout the genome and suggest that variant genotypes are present at high enough frequency to be readily transmitted and potentially to impact viral phenotype.",

Nasal swabs were collected on days 1, 3 and 5 post-infection from three camels experimentally infected at Colorado State University with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012, as described in Adney et al., 2014 [2]. The viral stock used for the infections was provided with the permission of the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and had been propagated in Vero E6 cells. Vero passage 7 of HCoV-EMC/2012 (\u201cSeed\u201d) was used for the camel infections and served as the pre-in vivo passage tissue culture control. No additional cell culture passages were performed as a control for the subsequent passage of the virus from Vero cells into camels. MERS-CoV was obtained from BEI Resources (EMC/2012, NR-44260) for generation of viral cDNA for testing of PCR primers prior to the arrival of nasal samples and seed stock. Note, the number assigned to each camel in this study differ from those assigned to the same camels in Adney et al. [2] (work performed at Colorado State University (CSU)). Camel 1 from this study corresponds to CSU Camel 2, Camel 2 corresponds to CSU Camel 3, and Camel 3 corresponds to CSU Camel 1.",

Variants showing up in 2 or more samples and for which there was at least 100 overlapping read pairs (ORP) were detected in each sample, and were detected at 473 positions in the genome; further analysis was prioritized for these sites. All primers were screened against the reads to trim primer sequences at the ends of reads using fastq-mcf [16] and default parameters. Genomic regions overlapping primer regions were examined separately to consider the potential for un-trimmed primer errors to remain in reads mapped to the reference genome.

Discrepancies in overlap product sizes were noted in some primer sets covering the last 4000 nts of the genome. These products were sequenced via Sanger sequencing and this confirmed that the primers bound to and amplified the correct area of the genome, however in some cases the amplified sequence terminated unexpectedly resulting in a truncated sequence output.

Thus some of the detected mutations could originate from viral genomes that are unable to replicate and persist in isolation. To reduce the emphasis of mutations associated with limited functional relevance, the analysis focused on iSNVs found in high abundance and/or present in two or more samples, and because multiple time points (days 1, 3, and 5) were analyzed for each camel, our analyses favored genomes that persisted during the infection. The expectation is that even when a viral genome is unable to replicate independent of the surrounding population, its presence at sufficient abundance could imply a functional role in the evolution of viral quasispecies. For example, it has previously been shown that defective genomes may function as \u201cdefective interfering particles\u201d and may impact viral infection dynamics such as viral persistence [17\u201319]. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that mutations that are observed at ultra-low abundance and occur rarely could represent viruses with limited functional impact.",

This indicates that MERS-CoV, similar to other coronaviruses, is prone to extreme genetic diversity in intrahost viral populations that may change rapidly in response to a change in host environment [9,11,37\u201340]. Until patterns of variation are defined for quasispecies present in non-laboratory passaged MERS-CoV samples, design of reagents for detecting MERS-CoV infections will be vulnerable to the effects of intrahost genetic diversity on reagent sensitivity. For example, at nt 2966, there is an iSNV present at 4% for Seed but greater than 20% in samples from all 3 camels indicating that this iSNV may be selected for in camels. Interestingly, an NCBI Blast search of the 60 nt region including this iSNV site revealed no indication of variability at this site for any of the 99 MERS virus sequences that were present on GenBank. This mutation, although present in a high proportion of the intrahost populations, would not be included in Genbank consensus sequences that are used to identify conserved regions for primer design and thus has the potential to interfere with viral detection assays that include this nt position. Indeed, only 5 mutations were detected in the consensus sequences, although 473 intrahost single nucleotide variants were identified. Many of these variants were present at high frequencies and could potentially influence viral phenotype and adversely affect the sensitivity of detection assays that target these regions for primer or probe binding.",
