Clinical case reports of CAdV-1 (Headley et al., 2013; Balboni et al., 2017) and CAdV-2 (Hamelin et al., 1986; Spibey and Cavanagh, 1989; Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007) support the hypothesis that CAdV continues to circulate in domestic dogs.",

Two booster immunizations containing purified CAdV-2 and equal volume of incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) were performed at 2-week intervals. Three days after the final booster, spleens were removed and splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. Hybridoma cell lines secreting antibodies against CAdV-2 were screened and subcloned at least three times by limiting-dilution (Greene et al., 1980). Hybridoma culture supernatants were screened for antibodies using indirect ELISA. Antibodies that bound to the CAdV-2 virus but failed to bind MDCK cells were considered CAdV-2-positive. The stable cells were injected into the abdominal cavities of BALB/c mice, which had been pretreated with liquid paraffin. Approximately 1 week later, the mAbs were harvested and purified from the seroperitoneum using an antibody purification kit (HiTrap Protein G HP, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, United States) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

The BLAST result showed that the CAdV-2 hexon protein had > 96% nucleotide identity and 100% coverage of the CAdV-1 hexon protein sequence, suggesting that the mAbs that recognized CAdV-2 may also recognize CAdV-1. Indeed, specificity testing showed that both could be detected by the ICS. The fact that the ICS is unable to distinguish between CAdV-2 and CAdV-1 might be an important limitation of this assay. Therefore, this ICS can serve as a quick field test that is used to direct which confirmatory PCR should be used to determine the type and help plan treatment. Moreover, there is a commercial ICS (Genbody, Korea) for rapid detection of CAdV-2 antigens on the market, so we can combine commercial ICS for CAdV-2 with our ICS for CAdV to determine the type. Of course, ICS testing must be also combined with a review of clinical symptoms of diseased animals in order to properly diagnose and treat in a clinical setting.",

            "text": "Virus isolation and real-time PCR assays are reliable methods for diagnosis of CAdV infections; however, these methods are mostly restricted to well-equipped laboratories. The ICS method has been widely applied to detect various infectious agents (Li et al., 2011; Nakayama et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019), including canine viruses such as rabies and CPV (Tao and Li, 2014; Sharma et al., 2018). However, there are no publications regarding ICS detection of CAdV, although there is commercial ICS that detect CAdV-2 on the market. Therefore, we developed an ICS using colloidal gold coupled with two CAdV-2-specific mAbs, and it was highly specific for detection of CAdV-2 and CAdV-1. This novel ICS will be useful for rapid diagnosis of CAdV without the need for expensive equipment.",

            "text": "Among the main factors affecting the ICS specificity and sensitivity, the most important factor is mAb affinity (i.e., the mAb used on the test-line and the colloidal gold conjugate must have high affinity for the CAdV epitopes). In this study, we chose two mAbs which targeted different epitopes as capture and detector antibodies in order to guarantee the sensitivity and specificity of the ICS and prevent other possible antigens from conjugating to the antibody. The limit of detection of the test strip was 2.0 \u00d7 102 TCID50/ml, which is more sensitive than the ICS developed using a single polyclonal antibody (pAb) and single mAb (limit of detection = 6.6 \u00d7 105 TCID50/ml) (Sharma et al., 2018) or another using two mAbs (limit of detection = 2.9 \u00d7 103 TCID50/ml) (Li et al., 2011). Its sensitivity was also higher than that of the commercial CAdV-2 test strip from Korean GenBody (limit of detection = 3.0 \u00d7 102 TCID50/ml). In addition, the sample diluent is also an important part in the colloidal gold test strip system, as there is a risk of non-specific release without using the sample diluent. In our sensitivity testing, CAdV-2 diluted in serum took a longer time for the bands to appear, and the bands were lighter than in samples diluted in sample dilution buffer. Therefore, the samples must be properly diluted in the sample diluent during clinical testing.",
