Another 100+ exported cases have been confirmed in other countries worldwide [3]. During 10:30am to 10:30pm, January 29th, 2020 (UTC + 8), we initiated an online survey on people\u2019s knowledge on NCIP by snowball sampling via Wechat invitation. 3083 invitees of 18\u201359 years old (2/3 females and 4/5 with bachelor\u2019s degree or higher) from all provinces in mainland China were enrolled, three quarters of which were from the six most developed provinces in China (Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu).",

Adults living in urban areas had a better awareness of the knowledge on NCIP than those in rural areas (72.7% vs.66.1%, p < 0.001). Such knowledge includes route of transmission (respiratory: 98.1% vs. 97.6%; contact: 95.4% vs. 91.5%), length of quarantine (97.2% vs. 95.1%), preventable vaccine (95.0% vs. 92.0%), drugs for treatment (84.7% vs. 77.9%), and time for mask replacement (89.0% vs. 86.6%). This finding indicates that Health education should be strengthened among adults living in rural areas where access to medical services is limited.",

However, 36.3% (34.6%\u201338.0%) of subjects who would wear mask cannot wear it correctly, with common mistakes of nose exposure to the air and long-time mask wear without replacement. Males (OR: 0.544, 95% CI: 0.440\u20130.673), younger adults (1.844, 1.466\u20132.320), and subjects with higher education (2.200, 1.780\u20132.718) were associated with better behaviours. Our study indicates that general public in China has high concerns on the NCIP in its rapid development phrase of the outbreak. Among all subjects, 85.9% (84.7\u201387.1%) believed that the plague could be controlled within 3 months due to the stringent measures advocated by government. As the NCIP outbreak continues, further understanding of the infection will help to adjust strategies for public\u2019 health education.",
