First identified in Europe and North America in the late 1980s [2], this syndrome is currently prevalent in most swine-producing countries [3]. Its causative agent, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, member of the Arterivirus genus [3]. Sequence comparison between viral isolates demonstrated that PRRSV exists in at least two distinct genotypes, the European genotype (EU type or type I) commonly referred to as PRRSV-1, and the North American genotype (NA type or type II) known as PRRSV-2 [4]. PRRSV has a very narrow cell tropism, and may induce persistent asymptomatic infections [5, 6].",

            "text": "The common occurrence of PRRSV infection with bacterial infections combined with the lack of efficient vaccines begs the question of the value of antibiotics for the treatment of PRRS. Traditionally, antibiotic efficacy is evaluated solely based on their antimicrobial properties. However, some macrolides have been found to modulate ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL-8 and IL-6, and to alter the production of lipid mediators that regulate inflammation [22\u201327]. These antibiotics accumulate within leukocytes at concentrations that may reach 500 times the systemic levels, which in turn allows them to be transported directly to the site of infection and confers them superior pharmacodynamics [25]. There is little evidence supporting a direct anti-viral property for macrolides, but their effects on leukocytes support the hypothesis that such macrolides may be beneficial in the context of viral infections such as PRRSV [24, 25]. In an attempt to uncover new mechanisms whereby macrolides may protect against the detrimental effects of PRRSV, the present study investigated the effects of tulathromycin in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages. Tulathromycin is a triamilide in which its 15 lactone-ring is comprised of 3 polar amine groups. It is used for the treatment and prevention of swine respiratory diseases associated with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae a gram-negative bacteria often found in PRRSV-infected pigs [14]. A. pleuropneumoniae exerts cytotoxic effects in macrophage and neutrophils and increases the production of pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL-8 \u2013also known as Interleukin-8- and leukotriene B4, which ultimately leads to severe pulmonary tissue damage and death [28\u201332]. Recent studies have demonstrated that in addition to its antimicrobial effects, tulathromycin inhibits CXCL-8 and LTB4 production in stimulated neutrophils and macrophages [26, 30, 33]. In addition, tulathromycin promotes the apoptotic death of neutrophils and their phagocytic clearance by macrophages -a phenomenon known as efferocytosis- both crucial processes in the resolution of inflammation [26, 30, 33\u201335]. We hypothesized that tulathromycin may generate immunomodulatory benefits in PRRSV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages. The findings indicate that tulathromycin, in the absence of a direct anti-viral effect, is able to restore the phagocytic function and to attenuate the pro-inflammatory phenotype of PRRSV-infected monocyte-derived porcine macrophages.",

AY545985.1) was used in all experiments as previously described [37]. Viral titration was performed via plaque assay. Briefly, MARC-145 cells were seeded in 12 well plates (Costar; Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) and grown until confluency. Once at confluency, cells were infected with PRRSV, for 1 hour in serum-free DMEM to allow attachment of viral particles. Following attachment, MARC-145 were overlaid with a solution of 2X MEM diluted 1:1 with 1.5% agarose. Infection was carried for 96h and plaques were revealed with neutral red (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA). Dr. R. M. Yates from University of Calgary generously provided both MARC-145 cell line and PRRSV-2 isolate NVSL 98\u20137895.",

Briefly, blood was pooled and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1200 x g, 4\u00b0C in a Heraeus Megafuge 16R (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The plasma was removed, and the buffy coat layer was collected into and diluted 1:1 in filter-sterilized 0.9% NaCl. Sterile polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate gradient solution (Histopaque; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) was added into each tube before centrifugation for 40 minutes at 1200 x g, 4\u00b0C. PBMCs located at the opaque interphase were then collected, washed with sterile-filtered 2X Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 x g, 4\u00b0C. Contaminating erythrocytes were removed by three hypotonic lysis cycles with sterile ice-cold double-distilled water for 30 seconds followed by the addition of 2X HBSS to restore tonicity. PBMCs were then resuspended in serum-free Iscove\u2019s modified Dubelcco\u2019s medium (IMDM; Thermo Ficher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer and viability was assessed by 0.1% trypan blue exclusion (Flow Laboratories). PBMCs purity was determined by Diff-Quick staining on cytospin slides (CytoSpin4 cytocentrifuge, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were then plated in tissue-culture treated 6, 12, 24 and 96 well plates (Costar; Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) or in LabTek chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a concentration of 1.0 x106 cells/mL for two hours to allow attachment. Following adhesion, non-adherent mononuclear cells were washed with warm HBSS (37\u00b0C). Subsequent adherent monocytes were incubated for 7 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in IMDM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated(HI)-pig serum (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin and 15% L929 supernatant to allow for differentiation into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). L929-conditionned medium is commonly used to potentiate monocytes to differentiate into homogenous populations of mature macrophages [37, 38]. Culture media was changed every 3 days. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the number of cells expressing CD163 (a known cluster of differentiation of monocytes and macrophages). More than 95% of the isolated cells expressed CD163 (S1 Fig). On day 7, as described previously [26], macrophage differentiation was monitored by microscopic morphological changes using Diff-Quick, and esterase staining, a well known feature allowing to distinguish between monocytes and mature macrophages [39]. At day 7, more than 95% of the cell preparations were differentiated macrophages (data not shown).",

            "text": "Seven days-old differentiated macrophages were incubated with tulathromycin (Draxxin; Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA) diluted in IMDM + 10% HI-pig serum at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL or 1 mg/mL or with vehicle control (IMDM + 10% pig serum), as established recently [26, 33]. At these concentrations and time points, the drug exhibits immunomodulating properties in bovine macrophages without inducing apoptosis [26]. Antibiotics like tulathromycin accumulate within leukocytes at concentrations that may reach >500 times the systemic levels, which in turn allows them to be transported directly to the site of infection, and hence confers them with superior pharmacodynamics [25, 40]. This phenomen is critical to the mode of action of tulathromycin. The drug concentrations used in these present experiments are consistent with this knowledge, and with previous studies that showed that tulathromycin has immunomodulating effects in bovine and porcine neutrophils and macrophages [26, 30, 33]. These recent studies have reproduced the same immunomodulating effects seen in vitro at these drug concentrations than when using live infected cattle and pigs given tulathromycin at the recommended therapeutic dosage [26, 30, 33]. Hence the concentrations used here reflect the physiological conditions in which the drug accumulates at high concentrations within these leukocytes. Indeed, comparison of intracellular drug concentrations in treated versus untreated animals have been published previously [40]. Using LC/ MS MS, in animals given the recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight, studies have measured the rapid and prolonged distribution of the drug into lung homogenates, pulmonary epithelial ling fluid (PELF), as well as in PELF cells. Macrophages are the major constituents of PELF cells in such preparations. Drug levels measured in PELF cells reached concentrations 565 times greater than those in plasma [40]. It is believed that this great affinity for cellular uptake may be related, in part, to the tri-basic chemical structure of the drug and the trapping of ionized drug within acidic phagolysosomes.",

Images were taken at 2, 12 and 24 hours post infection (p. i) with a Retiga 2000x (Q imaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). Importantly, experiments measuring cytokines and ROS followed those in which we measured apoptosis. This allowed to adjust concentrations of tulathromycin and virus to levels at which apoptosis was not detected in the cells, and hence cell death would not be a factor in the cellular cytokine and ROS responses.",

At these concentrations, neither the virus nor the drugs significantly induced MDM apoptosis at the experimental time points (data not shown).

PRRSV infection induced a sharp fibroblast-like morphological alteration and pseudopod projections in MDMs (Fig 3A). In uninfected cells (control and TUL), less than 20% of cells exhibited this change in morphology, while nearly 60% of the cells exhibited this phenotype upon PRRSV infection (Fig 3B). Tulathromycin pre-treatment significantly inhibited this morphological change in MDMs (Fig 3B).

PRRSV infection significantly reduced the number of cells with high phagocytic indeces, an effect that was abolished by tulathromycin (Figs 10C and 11C).

Since L929-conditioned medium increases viral titers, we hypothesized that it might be due to an increase in cell permissivity resulting from an increase in PRRSV receptor expression. To test this hypothesis, we cultivated monocytes in medium containing pig serum alone or in L929-conditionned medium for 7 days and then treated them with tulathromycin. MDMs differentiated in medium devoid of L929-supernatant expressed both receptors. Approximatively 28% of cells expressed CD163 and 89% of cells expressed CD169. Tulathromycin treatment did not significantly change the percentage of CD163 and CD169 positive cells (respectively 29% and 83% of positive cells) (Fig 14A; upper panels; Fig 14B). MDMs incubation in L929-supernatant supplemented medium was sufficient to significantly increase the number of CD163 positive cells (more than 90% of MDMs were CD163 positive versus less than 30% in pig serum supplemented medium alone). In addition, following L929-supernantant exposure we were not able to detect any CD169 positive cells (Fig 14A; lower panels; Fig 14B). Tulathromcyin treatment following L929-incubation did not have any significant effect on viral receptor expression in these experiments (Fig 14A; lower panels; Fig 14B).",

Treatment options to control PRRS outbreaks are limited and the efficacy of vaccines is thwarted by the antigenic variability of PRRSV [51]. Disease severity is closely related to the ability of the virus to dysregulate macrophages functions and induce inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that targeting either of these components may represent a critical element of novel therapeutic approaches. Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of macrolides have been well established [23\u201325\u201324]. Whether these effects may be beneficial in the context of viral diseases such as PRRS remains obscure. The present study assessed the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of tulathromycin (TUL) in PRRSV\u2013infected porcine macrophages. The findings indicate that TUL inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus, in the absence of any direct anti-viral effects.",

            "text": "The two most common cellular models are PAMs and MARC-145 cells [12, 52]. Both have significant limitations. The isolation of PAMs requires bronchoalveolar lavages, and the function of these cells depends on the age and environment of the animal [53]. Moreover, shortly after the initiation of a respiratory infection, alveolar macrophages are replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages, which therefore represent a key cell population in host- PRRSV interactions. Monkey MARC-145 epithelial cells do not originate from pigs. Therefore, the present experiments developed and used a simple porcine monocyte-derived macrophage model system to characterize the impact of tulathromycin on PRRSV infection. Previous in vitro studies have shown that the virus could infect blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) [54]. Consistent with previous findings, monocytes were less susceptible to PRRSV than differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages [54]. The addition of L929 supernatant during macrophage differentiation significantly increased their susceptibility to the virus compared to macrophages cultivated in medium supplemented with pig serum alone. It has been well established that L929 supernatant is a source of M-CSF and is used to induce macrophage differentiation [38]. Immunostaining of PRRSV receptors showed that the addition of L929 strongly upregulated CD163 (29% positive cells to 89% positive cells) but abolished CD169 expression. These results indicate that L929 supernatant modulate the expression of PRRSV receptors, and that CD163 alone is sufficient for PRRSV infection. This is consistent with recent observations showing that CD163, but not CD169, enabled non-permissive cells to become susceptible, and that increased CD163 correlates with increased susceptibility to PRRSV [49, 54, 55]. L929 supernatant is known to contain M-CSF, but very little is known about other cytokines and chemokines present in this supernatant [38]. Considering that CD163 and CD169 expression can be induced by IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 respectively, and that IL-10 treatment increases PRRSV infectivity while IFN-\u03b3 decreases it [54, 56, 57], the role of these cytokine in the modulation of macrophage susceptibility to infection requires further investigation. The present findings demonstrate that MDMs can readily be infected by PRRSV, and hence represent a useful cellular model to study PRRSV pathogenesis, as suggested recently [37].",

There is correlation between macrophage morphology and function, hence providing an easy way to monitor changes in macrophage polarization [41]. In this study we found that PRRSV infection dramatically altered monocyte-derived macrophage morphology, inducing an elongated phenotype with numerous cytoplasmic pseudopods. Recent findings indicate that these pseudopods promote intercellular junctions allowing PRRSV to evade host immunity through direct intercellular spread [59]. Tulathromycin pre-treatment was sufficient to prevent the PRRSV-induced pseudopod formation and morphological alterations in macrophages. Whether TUL may prevent intercellular junctions and thus hinder PRRSV immune evasion requires more research.",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis that change in macrophage morphology was associated with altered function, we measured the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (CXCL-8 and IL-10 respectively) as well as the production of mitochondrial ROS. CXCL-8 is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant secreted by macrophages and other cell types, and is a critical mediator of neutrophil infiltration in inflamed tissues [26]. The present findings demonstrate that PRRSV is a potent inducer of CXCL-8 in monocyte-derived macrophages. Virally induced CXCL-8 secretion was inhibited by TUL. Studies in live animals are warranted to assess whether these observations suggest that TUL might attenuate PRRSV-induced inflammation through CXCL-8 inhibition. Mitochondrial ROS production is a hallmark of cell stress and inflammation, and contributes to PRRSV-induced tissue damage [42, 43]. Other reports showed that mitochondrial ROS production was implicated in PRRSV-induced apoptotic death of MARC-145 cells [43]. Here we demonstrate that PRRSV indeed induces ROS production in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages, and that this production is inhibited when the cells are pre-treated with the antibiotic. Tulathromycin was also able to restore ROS levels to control in LPS-stimulated cells but not in LPS and PRRSV exposed to both LPS and PRRSV. Interestingly, in these conditions MDMs showed a decrease in ROS production compared to cells exposed only to LPS. This suggest that PRRSV may inhibit intracellular ROS production of MDMs during bacterial infections.Another set of studies sought to determine whether TUL inhibition of the viral-induced pro-inflammatory CXCL-8 coincided with an increase in anti-inflammatory signaling. We found that the virus alone was able to inhibit IL-10 secretion, and that TUL blocked this effect. These data are in contrast with others from the scientific literature. Indeed, it is generally accepted that PRRSV induce IL-10 production to increase its infectivity [54]. In fact, IL-10 activated cells are more permissive to PRRSV than unstimulated M1-polarized macrophages [54]. More research is necessary to explain the mechanisms whereby PRRSV regulates the production of IL-10. Tulathromycin alone did not induce IL-10 secretion suggesting that CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS inhibition by TUL was not dependent on IL-10 production. Taken together the present findings strongly support the hypothesis that tulathromycin may attenuate PRRSV-induced inflammation by inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory CXCL-8, and by preventing the suppression of anti-inflammatory IL-10.",

Necrosis is known to exacerbate local inflammation, to induce the release of cytotoxic molecules, and to lead to extensive tissue damage, while cell apoptosis contributes to the resolution of inflammation [62, 63]. More research in live PRRSV-infected animals will help determine whether TUL is able to promote the resolution of PRRSV-induced pulmonary inflammation at least in part via such a mechanism, as well by shifting local cytokine release from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory mediators.",

            "text": "It is well established that PRRSV infected pigs are often infected by secondary pathogens [13, 58]. At present, the mechanisms resulting in the increase of secondary infections during PRRSV infections remain incompletely understood. Studies have shown that PRRSV is directly able to impair macrophage phagocytosis, which in turn may represent a key element of the development of secondary infection [12, 64, 65]. Macrophage phagocytosis is triggered when phagocytic receptors including opsonic receptors (FcR) or pattern recognition receptors such as the mannose receptor, are activated [45, 66]. Using non-opsonized zymosan particles or IgG-coated latex beads, the present findings demonstrate that PRRSV significantly inhibits both phagocytic pathways. These results are consistent with previous reports showing decreased phagocytosis of latex beads, or live bacteria (Streptococcus suis) upon PRRSV infection [67, 68]. Recent findings suggest that PRRSV-1 inhibits phagocytosis through its interaction with sialoadhesin (also referred to as CD169). However, in our model system, L929 cultivated MDMs were negative for CD169 suggesting either that mechanisms for inhibition of phagocytosis are strain and/or genotype dependent, or that PRRSV may inhibit phagocytosis through multiple pathways [16]. Another report recently demonstrated that the same NSVL-98-7895 strain as used here may impair phagosomal maturation and NADPH oxidase-mediated respiratory burst, both implicated in the antimicrobial properties of macrophages [37]. TUL blocked the PRRSV-induced inhibition of non-opsonized and IgG-mediated macrophage phagocytosis. These observations pave the way towards studies in vivo to assess whether this antibiotic might help control secondary infections during PRRSV infections through this mechanisms in addition to its direct anti-microbial properties. The mechanisms whereby TUL protects against PRRSV-induced inhibition of phagocytosis require further elucidation.",

In the experiments described herein, TUL did not exhibit any direct anti-viral properties, nor did it significantly alter the expression of the two receptors used by the virus for entry, CD169 and CD163. Together, the data indicate that in porcine MDMs, TUL is able to block PRRSV-induced pseudopod formation, necrosis, pro-inflammatory CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS production, and inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. In addition TUL also synergized with PRRSV to induce pro-resolution cell apoptosis and the production of anti-inflammaotry IL-10. The results also show that the protective modulation of macrophage structure, function, and behavior by TUL occurs in the absence of a direct anti-viral effect. The present observations pave the way towards further studies with a PRRSV-1 strain to determine whether the effects we observed in this study are conserved with the other PRRSV genotype. Studies in vivo will help determine whether and how these effects may translate into clinical benefits.",
