Because of under-reporting, the actual number of people infected is substantially larger, particularly considering that many countries have ceased testing for A(H1N1) [1]. As human-to-human transmission became widespread in at least one region of the world, WHO rapidly declared the outbreak an imminent pandemic [2] and with widespread human infection, WHO declared a phase 6 pandemic on 11 June 2009, where it remains at the time of submission [3]. The virus appears to have a higher reproduction number and somewhat higher case fatality ratio than recent seasonal influenza viruses [4], [5], and has certainly caused great concern in the population, fueled by both extensive media coverage and an initially high level of uncertainty about mortality rates and transmissibility of the virus.",

How people assess risk of infection and how such risk assessment drives behavioral change is of great interest as individual social distancing can greatly affect the spread of an epidemic [7], [8], [9]. While the effect of behavioral change in response to perceived health threats on the spread of infectious diseases has been investigated theoretically for some time, particularly in the context of sexually transmitted diseases [8], recent work has started addressing the problem in a broader context that is also applicable to the spread of influenza [6], [7]. This work has a strong, though as yet under-explored relationship to work on risk perception and health threats [10], [11], [12].",

Instead, they are usually gathered with a substantial delay in the case of influenza A(H1N1) [13], after the epidemic has run its course, as in the case of SARS [9], or before sustained human to human transmission is established, as in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) [14]. However, the feasibility of halting or mitigating the spread of an infectious disease is highest during the very early phases of an outbreak, and thus data on behavioral response during this time would provide valuable information for public health policy and research. Here, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n = 6,249) about risk perception of the outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 29 \u2013 May 5, 2009) of the emergence of novel swine-origin Influenza A(H1N1).",

Using a binomial GLM with canonical logit-link, we modeled the protection index as a function of covariates. Our primary interest was the possible mediating effect of affective variables on action taken to protect against swine flu infection. To evaluate the hypothesis that respondents' affective state (subjective anxiety, fatalism about infection) predicts protective measures, we include in the model demographic (age, gender), epidemiological (household size, number of contacts, survey day), and media (source of information on the outbreak) conditioning variables. For the media variables, we constructed dummies with a value of 1 corresponding to answers of \u201cvery often\u201d or \u201coften\u201d and a value of 0 for all other responses to the question of \u201cHow often do you use the following sources to get information about swine flu?\u201d With such a large number of conditioning variables, in addition to the affective variables of greatest interest, there is a distinct danger of over-fitting the GLM. To address this problem, we used likelihood-based model selection [17] to search the model space set up by our conditioning variables [18].",

There are two potential explanations for this finding: (1) individuals with small social support networks (and consequently, few contacts outside the home) are more anxious, making it more likely that they will take greater protective actions or (2) people concerned about infection and taking relatively many protective actions also reduce the number of contacts they have and therefore had a small number of contacts in the past 24 hours. The first explanation is consistent with work in social epidemiology on the role of social networks in mediating infection risk [24], [25] Because of the nature of the sample, we are unable to evaluate the direction of causality that leads to this result.

Unlike pharmaceutical interventions, non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing may be effective in halting or at least mitigating an epidemic independent of the specific biology of a pathogen, and thus provide a reliable set of strategies to combat infectious diseases that warrant further attention [30]. Our results that people do not rely on social networking tools to the extent that they rely on other media may have implications for CDC strategies for spreading public health information via social media [19].
