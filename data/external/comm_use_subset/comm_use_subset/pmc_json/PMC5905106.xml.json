Extracellular S100A12 has cytokine-like effects and functions as a phagocyte-specific danger-associated molecule (alarmin), with a central role in immune responses [9]. S100A12 plays a role in host defense against microorganisms and parasites [10] by sequestering essential trace elements such as Cu2+ [3], and the protein also has chemotactic properties especially for monocytes and mast cells [6, 11, 12]. S100A12 has also been suggested to counteract tissue damage by competing with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for Zn2+-binding [13]. The S100A12 protein is a ligand for the pattern recognition receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) and activates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway [6, 14], a mechanism linked to the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in humans [6, 15, 16].",

Recent studies suggest that fecal S100A12 concentrations may also be clinically useful as a biomarker of inflammation in dogs [18, 19]. In dogs with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation (IBD), fecal canine S100A12 concentrations were increased and correlated with the severity of clinical disease, endoscopic changes observed in the intestine and the severity of histologic lesions in the colon [18]. Higher fecal S100A12 concentrations were also shown to be associated with a negative outcome in dogs with IBD [19]. The role of S100A12 as a biomarker of inflammation is currently an area of intensive research in both human and veterinary medicine, and targeting the RAGE-S100A12 axis may also open new therapeutic avenues.",

Based on the literature available [10, 17, 20], we hypothesized that infections with enteric parasites - but not enteropathogenic viruses - are associated with increased fecal canine S100A12 concentrations, and that these etiologies need to be ruled out when using fecal S100A12 as a biomarker in dogs with IBD. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the presence and numbers of selected endoparasites and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs on fecal canine S100A12 concentrations in a large cohort of puppies. Because biomarkers can be affected by patient physiological factors such as age, sex, or size [23], the effect of these parameters was also evaluated.",

In contrast, the presence of the parasite genera Cystoisospora spp. - independent of their number or subspecies - as well as an infection with the viral pathogens CCV or CPV2 were shown to be associated with alterations in fecal S100A12 concentrations on univariate analysis but not in a multivariate model. Thus, infections with enteropathogens evaluated in this study are not primarily associated with alterations in fecal S100A12 concentrations, whereas the concentration of fecal S100A12 is affected by the fecal score which reflects the overall health of the digestive tract. This is important for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in patients with suspected chronic gastrointestinal inflammation [27]. These findings are consistent with the results of a previous investigation in asymptomatic children showing fecal S100A12 concentrations to only have a tendency to be increased with concurrent Giardia duodenalis and helminth infections [20]. Also, the concentrations of fecal S100A12 measured in the study by Garz\u00f3n et al. [20] were comparable to those concentrations detected in our study. Our results further agree with a previous study in adult people revealing no differences in fecal S100A12 concentrations in patients with viral gastroenteritis caused by Norwalk-like virus or rotavirus [17].",

This was still an unexpected finding given that S100A12 has been shown to have filariostatic or filaricidal properties (anti-parasite mechanism) through its binding to parasite paramyosin [10, 28] and the fact that S100A12 can be expressed in eosinophils in humans [29]. However, though endoparasites are more likely to be associated with eosinophilic or mixed inflammation [30], whether S100A12 expression in eosinophils is also induced or up-regulated in the context of inflammation in dogs has not been investigated. Also, experimental infection in cattle with Echinococcus granulosus was associated with a strong S100A12 response [31]. However, infection with E. granulosus results in a more granulomatous type of inflammation although other cells were also shown to express S100A12 at the site of infection-associated inflammation. These findings further suggest that limiting the availability of transition metal ions (i.e. Ca2+, Zn2+ and Mn2+) is not the mechanism of action to combat parasite or viral infections as opposed to infections with bacterial pathogens [32] or at least that S100A12 may not play a significant role in it. Though not demonstrated for S100A12, antimicrobial activity against E. coli has been shown for canine calprotectin [33].",

However, diarrhea in puppies is often multifactorial [24] and other factors that can influence the fecal score (e.g. stress, diet change, or other environmental factors) may also affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs. The effect of dietary factors (e.g. diet type, feeding practices, dietary supplements, amount of milk ingested by suckling) on fecal S100A12 concentrations could not be evaluated in this study due to the large variety of these factors and the fact that the quantity of milk ingested cannot be determined. However, the association between fecal score and fecal S100A12 concentrations could also reflect an infection with another enteropathogen or enteropathogens for which puppies in this study were not evaluated. Small breed size was another significant factor for having an increased fecal S100A12 concentration in this study. Contrary to this, large breed size has been previously shown to be a determinant of lower fecal consistency [25], and this variable had been taken into account when interpreting fecal scores (normal/abnormal) in this study. Thus, one possible explanation for small breed dogs having a higher frequency of abnormal stools in this study could be an undetected infectious cause or environmental factors. However, lack of an ability of the 13-point scoring system [25] to sufficiently differentiate fecal qualities may also explain this finding, though this scoring system has been validated for use in puppies and appears to be superior to the 5-point system [34] that is often used to differentiate fecal qualities. The relationship between fecal S100A12 concentrations, fecal score, and breed size as well as its clinical implication, and whether the current results also translate to those in adult dogs, warrants further research.",

Hence, age was also evaluated as a potential influencing factor as an age-related effect has been demonstrated for fecal calprotectin concentrations (another S100/calgranulin protein complex) in dogs [24]. In contrast to fecal calprotectin, age did not have an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs, similar to previous findings in older puppies and adult dogs [26]. The reason for this difference between fecal calprotectin and fecal S100A12 is unknown. Possible explanations could be that S100A12 leakage into the still maturing gastrointestinal tract is negligible and that S100A12 production may be more specific to cells of the inflammatory response compared to calprotectin. However, these hypotheses need to be further investigated.",

Using this reference interval in puppies appears to be reasonable given that 6% of the dogs in the present study had a fecal S100A12 concentration above the upper limit of the reference interval. This fraction is similar to the fraction of the reference population (5%) that would be expected to have a fecal S100A12 concentration above the upper limit of the reference interval established by using the central 95th percentile [35]. Also, the upper limit of the reference interval of 745 ng/g in dogs is almost identical to that recently reported for children (750 ng/g) [36], suggesting that fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs are comparable to those in people. As opposed to rodents [21], the S100A12 protein is encoded in the canine genome [22]. Thus, diseases in dogs appear to be an ideal model - and one that is superior to rodent models - for studying S100A12 biology and the RAGE-S100A12 axis in humans. Hence, future studies into the function and diagnostic utility of the S100A12 protein, as well as the S100A12-RAGE axis in chronic inflammatory conditions and their proposed use as novel selective therapeutic targets, should benefit from the present and also future studies in dogs.",
