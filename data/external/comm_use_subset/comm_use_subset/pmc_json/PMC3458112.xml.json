            "text": "RNA silencing collectively refers to diverse gene expression regulatory pathways that control a large number of cellular processes, such as developmental patterning, responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and maintenance of genome stability. It is conserved in animals, plants, most fungi and some protists [1]\u2013[3]. RNA silencing pathways involve small RNAs of 20\u201330 nucleotides, which are mainly derived from digestion of RNA duplexes by the action of RNase III\u2013like nucleases called Dicer or Dicer-like (DCL) proteins [4]\u2013[6]. These small RNAs are then associated with effector complexes, containing a protein belonging to the Argonaute (AGO) family, to guide sequence specific mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, or epigenetic modifications [7]. Interestingly, it has been well-established that RNA silencing plays a key antiviral role in plants, fungi and invertebrate animals, where infecting viruses induce the production of viral-derived small interfering (si)RNAs from their genomes, replication-intermediate double-stranded (ds)RNAs, fold-back structures within viral mRNAs, or dsRNA molecules produced by the action of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) on a single stranded viral RNA template [8]\u2013[11]. Although the role of RNA silencing as an antiviral mechanism in vertebrate animals is controversial, the fact that bona fide viral-derived small RNAs from different mammal-infecting viruses have recently been identified suggests that RNA silencing could also be an antiviral strategy in these organisms [12]\u2013[14].",

Two members of the family, namely Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), are etiological agents of diseases imposing a heavy economical burden on the poultry and aquaculture industries, respectively. IBDV causes a highly acute immunosuppressive disease affecting juvenile domestic chickens [48]. IPNV is responsible for an acute systemic disease affecting different species of freshwater and marine fishes, mollusks, and crustaceans [49]. Birnaviruses contain a polyploid bipartite dsRNA genome that is packaged into a single virus particle [50]. Structural units are derived from a polyprotein precursor that is translationally self-cleaved to release three polypeptides, pVP2 (the capsid protein precursor), VP4 (the protease) and VP3 [51]. VP3 is a multitasking protein that has several activities throughout the viral life cycle. In addition to being a self-interacting protein [52], VP3 interacts with pVP2 during particle morphogenesis [53], with VP1 acting as a transcriptional activator [54], and with the dsRNA to make ribonucleoprotein complexes [55], a unique feature among dsRNA viruses. The atomic structure of VP3 was partially solved by X-ray crystallography to 2.3 \u00c5 [56].",

For this, we decided to use an heterologous transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana\n[15], as it provides readout of RNA silencing without the confounding induction of other immune and interferon-responsive pathways [61], [62]. Different plasmids expressing untagged and N-terminal TAP (NTAP)-tagged versions of IBDV VP3 were constructed and transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Equivalent constructs expressing Influenza A virus NS1 and the well-characterized CVYV P1b silencing suppressor [63], [64] were used as positive controls. A GFP-expressing plasmid (p35S:GFP) was used as the inducer, target and reporter of RNA silencing. For simplicity, we will refer to Agrobacterium strains by the name of the plasmid they carry. Leaf patches infiltrated with p35S:GFP plus either pMDC32 or pNTAPi empty vectors displayed the highest intensity of GFP fluorescence at 2\u20133 days post-agroinfiltration (dpa) (not shown). GFP fluorescence in these leaves dropped to hardly detectable levels by 6 dpa (Fig. 1A and not shown) and, consistently with this fact, Northern blot analysis showed very low accumulation of GFP mRNA in them (Fig. 1A and data not shown). In contrast, leaves infiltrated with p35S:GFP plus pMDC32-NS1, p35S-NTAP-NS1 or p35S-NTAP-P1b, expressing untagged or TAP-tagged NS1, or TAP-tagged P1b, respectively, showed bright fluorescence at 6 dpa given the protection of GFP mRNAs from degradation by post-transcriptional gene silencing (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Interestingly, those leaf patches infiltrated with p35S:GFP plus either pMDC32-VP3 or p35S-NTAP-NS1 expressing untagged or TAP-tagged VP3, respectively, displayed GFP fluorescence as bright as positive controls at 6 dpa. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of IBDV VP3 inhibited GFP mRNA degradation very efficiently (Fig. 1A and data not shown).",

In the sense RNA-triggered silencing assay, NTAP-P1b had, as previously reported [63], very little effect on GFP siRNA accumulation (Fig. 1A). In contrast, both NTAP-NS1 and NTAP-VP3 proteins appeared to abolish the generation of GFP siRNAs (Fig. 1A). Similarly, in the dsRNA-triggered silencing assay, NTAP-P1b had no effect on the generation of siRNAs from the 5\u2032 terminal two thirds of the GFP gene (siRNA GF), which derive mainly from the dsRNA trigger (p35S:GF-IR). However, the accumulation of siRNAs from the 3\u2032 terminal region of the GFP sequence, which are not encoded by p35S:GF-IR and, thus, are secondarily generated in the amplification phase of the RNA silencing process (siRNA P), is strongly inhibited by NTAP-P1b (Fig. 1B and [64]). Interestingly, expression of either NTAP-VP3 or NTAP-NS1 produced a strong reduction in the generation not only of P-derived siRNAs, but also of those siRNAs deriving from the GF dsRNA region (Fig. 1B), indicating that these proteins use a mechanism different from that of CVYV P1b to suppress the RNA silencing.",

Purified VP3 samples were incubated with different dsRNA molecules, and complexes were then resolved by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B).

Positively charged amino acids of the IBDV VP3 protein, predicted from crystal structure [56] to be from the region involved in dsRNA binding, were replaced by negatively charged Asp residues (Patch 1 and Patch 2, Fig. 2A). In addition, a deletion of the highly hydrophilic C-terminal region of IBDV VP3 (position 222\u2013258), which was previously proposed as potentially relevant in both nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions [56], was engineered (\u0394C, Fig. 2A). Mutant proteins were produced and purified from insect cells, and tested for their dsRNA binding capacity against the IBDV genomic RNAs, as well as a 32P-labelled 21-nt siRNA duplex, by EMSA (Fig. 2C).",

In contrast, both VP3 Patch 1 (Fig. 2C) and VP3 Patch 1+2 (data not shown) appear to be completely unable to reduce the mobility of long dsRNA and ds-siRNA, suggesting that VP3 Patch 1 plays a central role in binding to any species of dsRNA.

HCPro is expressed as part of a genomic-length polyprotein, from which it is exscinded by the serine proteinase activity of the upstream protein P1 and its own cisteine proteinase activity [68]. To allow the excision of VP3, which lacks auto-proteolytic activity, from the viral polyprotein, both ends of the VP3 coding sequence cloned in the PPV chimera were slightly modified to generate cleavage sites recognized by P1 and NIa, the third PPV proteinase. Thus, the VP3 produced by PPV-VP3 is expected to have two extra aa (SD) at its N-end and a QVVVHQ tail at its C-end.",

Interestingly, several viral families whose members have dsRNA genomes exist in the nature, which might demand additional protective measures to ensure efficient infection. The VP3 protein produced by members of the family Birnaviridae, is known to be involved in forming filamentous ribonucleoproteins that shield genomic dsRNAs [55].

In the first assay, RNA silencing is triggered by the sense transcript of the GFP reporter gene, which is converted into dsRNA by a host RdRp, while in the second, RNA silencing is induced by an inverted-repeated construct that directly forms a GFP-specific dsRNA. IBDV VP3 protected GFP mRNA from RNA silencing-mediated degradation in both systems (Fig. 1).

To establish the mechanism of action by which VP3 suppresses RNA silencing, we found that, in addition to its capacity to interact with long-dsRNAs [66], [67], IBDV VP3 can effectively bind ds-small RNA molecules of different sizes (Fig. 2B). This includes dsRNAs with a length of 21-nt, which is the typical siRNA size class produced from RNA viruses during the infection cycle. Moreover, whereas the plant VSR P1b, which suppresses silencing by specific interaction with 21-nt small RNAs [64], mainly affected the accumulation of secondary siRNAs, both primary and secondary GFP-derived siRNAs were barely detected in leaves expressing either IBDV VP3 or Influenza virus NS1 (Fig. 1B). These data support the idea that VP3 and NS1 could use a dual mode of action, which would be different to that used by P1b, based on perturbing Dicer-mediated cleavage of long dsRNAs to produce siRNAs whilst also blocking the incorporation of these siRNAs into RNA-induced silencing complexes. A similar mechanism of action has been suggested for the VSR B2 from the insect nodavirus Flock house virus\n[71], [79]. By using a mutagenic approach, we have identified a region of basic residues, called here as Patch 1, involved in the dsRNA binding activity of IBDV VP3 and shown that these residues are also relevant for RNA silencing suppression (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3). Whereas these results support the contribution of dsRNA binding to the RNA silencing suppression activity of VP3, they do not provide clues on the relative importance of long dsRNA protection and siRNA sequestration since all mutations had similar effects on the VP3 binding to the different tested RNA molecules (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3). Interestingly, whereas mutations in another region of basic residues, here called as Patch 2, produced a partial reduction in the capacity of IBDV VP3 to interact with both long and short dsRNAs, they did not affect the ability of this protein to suppress the degradation of GFP mRNA by silencing (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3). This result indicates that a diminished dsRNA binding is enough to counteract the silencing machinery, as previously observed for the VSR P1b [64], and supports the idea that the VP3 Patch 2 could also be involved in RNA interaction.",

Here, we found that IBDV VP3 is able to replace HCPro, the well-characterized VSR, in a PPV infection (Fig. 5). This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the RNA silencing suppression activity of IBDV VP3 to counteract host defences in a viral infection context. However, it is important to note that although the antisilencing activities of IBDV VP3 and PPV HCPro expressed from the PPV polyprotein are similar in an agroinfiltration assay (Fig. S2), the infection efficiency of PPV-VP3 chimera is somewhat lower than that of wild type PPV. N. benthamiana plants infected with this chimerical virus did eventually recover from the infection (Fig. 5D). These findings are in agreement with recent results obtained with PPV chimeras expressing different heterologous VSRs [82], supporting the idea that the capacity of a given VSR to replace HCPro in a potyviral infection does not rely only in the strength of suppressors, but also in the particular molecular mechanism that they use to suppress the RNA silencing.",

Although a broad range of insect viruses are known targets of antiviral RNA silencing, VSRs have been identified only in positive sense strand RNA viruses [84], [85]. Interestingly, it has also been reported that RNA silencing is an efficient antiviral immune response against the birnavirus DXV [86], but the mechanism used by the virus to counteract this antiviral defence remained uncharacterized. Here, we provide the first evidence that the VP3 protein from DXV has RNA silencing suppression activity (Fig. 4), which suggests that it plays this counter defensive role during insect infections. The best-studied VSR of an insect virus, the B2 protein of alphanodaviruses [23], [71], [79], has a functional counterpart in fish betanodaviruses [87], [88]. Similarly, our data show that VP3 from IPNV, a fish infecting birnavirus, also has the ability to suppress the RNA silencing. It is worth to mention that even thought the primary amino acid sequence among these three VP3s is barely conserved, particularly remarkable in the case DXV VP3 [56], all of them interact with dsRNA without size specificity and counteract the RNA silencing (Fig. 4). Altogether, these results strongly supports the idea that silencing suppression is a conserved activity among different VP3 proteins and that RNA silencing could play a defensive role in viral infections of fishes and birds. In agreement with this postulate, an VSR from an avian herpersvirus has also been recently characterized [41].",

            "text": "Conclusive evidence demonstrating that an antiviral silencing mechanism operates in vertebrates is still lacking. Although early tests failed to find viral-derived siRNAs, the hallmark of antiviral silencing, in different infected organisms (reviewed by [89]), the availability of deep sequencing technologies has recently allowed not only the identification of siRNAs derived from a wide set of mammal-infecting RNA viruses, but also revealed their association with silencing effector complexes [13], [14]. These data, together with the observation that many mammal-infecting RNA viruses encode VSRs [42], suggest that RNA silencing of vertebrates is, to some extent, engaged in fighting against RNA viruses. It is important to note that the relationship between RNA silencing and viruses could be multifaceted in these organisms; hence, in addition to the possible cis-acting effect of viral-derived siRNAs, some of these molecules are able to target host genes involved in antiviral defense [90], [91]. Moreover, several host miRNA have been shown to contribute to virus resistance [34], [92]\u2013[96], whereas others are essential for the replication of the virus [97]. In this intricate scenario, the contribution of VSRs is expected to be tightly regulated. In general, VSRs from mammal-infecting viruses also participate in the counter defense against other antiviral responses of the host, such as the interferon system, which add a further level of intricacy to the activity of these proteins [29], [31]. Cross-talk between RNA silencing and IFN-dependent defense pathways have been reported [13], [62], [94] and consequently the dsRNA-binding abilities of these VSRs could contribute to interference with both IFN- and RNA silencing-mediated antiviral defences in tandem [29]. Therefore, the dsRNA binding activity of IBDV VP3 could prevent genomic dsRNAs to induce RNA silencing, as well as modulate other dsRNA-induced antiviral defences. In agreement with this hypothesis, recent results indicate that IBDV VP3 inhibits PKR-dependent apoptosis induced by the expression of the viral protein VP2 (Busnadiego et al., submitted).",

The construction of the rBV expressing a 6 \u00d7 His-tagged version of VP3 Patch1 mutant (rBV hisVP3Patch1) was performed as follows. A 789 bp DNA fragment coding for a mutant version of VP3 with four aa substitutions (K99D, R102D, K105D and K106D, VP3MutPatch1) flanked by BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, was generated by gene synthesis (Genscript) and inserted into the EcoRV site located in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the pUC57 plasmid. This plasmid was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and the fragment containing the mutated VP3 ORF was purified and inserted into the MCS of the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBacHtb (Invitrogen), previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid (pFBhisVP3Patch1) was then used to generate the corresponding rBV making use of the Bac-to-Bac system, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen). The generation of the rBV expressing a 6 \u00d7 His-tagged version of VP3 Patch2 mutant (rBV hisVP3Patch2) that carries four point mutations (R159D, R168D, H198D and R200D) was done using the approach described above. The construction of the rBV expressing a 6 \u00d7 His-tagged version of VP3 Patch1+2 mutant (rBV hisVP3Patch1+2) was performed by replacing the BamHI/XbaI fragment from the hisVP3Patch2 ORF by that of its hisVP3Patch1 counterpart. The construction of rBVs expressing the VP3 from DXV and IPNV was performed as follows. DNA fragments coding for the DXV VP3 and the IPNV VP flanked by BamHI and EcoRI were generated by gene synthesis (Genscript) and inserted into the EcoRV site of pUC57. Cloning of these ORFs into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBacHtb to generate pFBhisVP3dxv and pFBhisVP3ipnv, and the generation of the corresponding rBVs, were carried out as described above.",
