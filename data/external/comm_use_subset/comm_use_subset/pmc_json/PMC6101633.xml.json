In 2004, the genome sequence of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans was released as Assembly 19 (1). With the challenge of working with a heterozygous diploid organism, new computational methods had to be developed and resulted in the release in 2013 of Assembly 22, an assembly of a completely phased diploid genome sequence for the standard C. albicans reference strain SC5314 (2). This opened new perspectives to understand the genetic basis and functional mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis and evolution in this organism.",

Nowadays, the growing availability of whole-genome datasets has encouraged a shift towards the development of functional genomics and systems biology approaches, enabling analysis of high-throughput whole-genome assays to better understand biological networks. In this context, major efforts have been made to generate large-scale deletion (6\u201310) or overexpression (11\u201313) mutant collections. Genome-wide ORF libraries or ORFeomes represent useful resources for the implementation of approaches used to elucidate gene function (14). Besides, the development of collections of overexpression mutants (12), ORFeomes facilitate approaches aimed at evaluating protein subcellular localization and identifying protein\u2013protein interactions (yeast two-hybrid) both at steady state and in response to environmental stimuli (15).",

Here, we describe the generation and validation of the latest C. albicans ORFeome collection, which consists of 5099 ORFs in pDONR207, allowing the transfer of the cloned genes into a variety of C. albicans Gateway\u2122-compatible expression vectors. To this end, we also provide a panel of 15 expression vectors that differ in the combination of promoter/selection marker they are carrying, and give different options regarding the tagging of the cloned gene product. These 15 expression vectors have been validated using the filament-specific transcription factor gene UME6. In addition, we also provide a secondary collection of 34 expression vectors with additional options regarding the choice of the promoter and the tagging of the cloned gene product. Finally, among the numerous applications of ORFeome collections, we present a powerful association of the C. albicans ORFeome and a C. albicans-adapted two-hybrid system (33) that will allow systematic protein\u2013protein interaction screening in C. albicans.",

The 3\u2032-ends were also sequenced with the 207VER-R oligonucleotide to ensure that the oligonucleotides did not carry deletions. All inserts validated by Sanger sequencing were systematically subjected to full-length sequence analysis using Illumina technology. Plasmid DNAs were fragmented using a Bioruptor sonicator. Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the KAPA LTP Library Preparation Kit protocol (KAPA Biosystems, catalogue number KK8232). The libraries were not made in duplicates and therefore pools (1\u20135) were sequenced only once. If nonsense or frameshift mutations were observed in a cloned ORF, another colony was checked or the ORF reamplified and cloned again. If these attempts were unsuccessful, cloning of the ORF was abandoned. Clones containing contiguous deletions or insertions of multiples of 3 bp were accepted. Missense mutations and those located within introns were accepted. It should be noted that further analysis of each mutation-containing ORF is required to determine whether or not mutations affect the function of the ORF. The fastq files have been deposited into NCBI-SRA and are available under the BioProject PRJNA472959. In Supplementary Table S1, the sequencing pool (pools 1\u20135) is given for each cloned ORF.

CIp-GTW was obtained after deleting PTET from CIp-PTET-GTW with Acc65I and HpaI.

While destination vectors for ORF expression in hosts such as E. coli or S. cerevisiae are available (49,50), only a few destination vectors for ORF expression in C. albicans have been reported (12). Therefore, we set out to establish a collection of Gateway\u2122-adapted destination vectors for constitutive or conditional expression of untagged or tagged ORFs in C. albicans. Our primary collection of 15 C. albicans destination vectors derived from CIp10S (12) provides a choice of two promoters, either the constitutive promoter PTDH3 or the inducible promoter PTET, and the option for N- or C-terminal fusion to various epitope tags (3xHA or TAP) (Table 2 and Figure 3). Integration of the destination vectors and their derivatives at the RPS1 locus in the C. albicans genome is promoted by StuI or I-SceI linearization. These CIp10-derived vectors carry either the auxotrophic marker URA3 or the NAT1 marker that confers resistance to nourseothricin and can be used with clinical isolates. However, PTET-bearing plasmids cannot carry the NAT1 marker since the transactivator needed for tetracycline-mediated induction of PTET is borne on the NAT1-carrying pNIMX plasmid (12). All vectors harbor a so-called spacer sequence (SP) originating from the E. coli kanamycin resistance gene, for barcode insertion and subsequent Illumina-based barcode sequencing. A second set of 34 plasmids was also generated with the constitutive promoters PACT1 or the inducible promoter PPCK1, and the option for N- or C-terminal fusion to GFP (Table 2). All 49 destination vectors were designated with a standardized nomenclature, pCA-DESTijkl, whereby i stands for the transformation marker (1, URA3; 2, NAT1); j stands for the promoter (1, PTET; 2, PPCK1; 3, PTDH3; 4, PACT1); k stands for N-terminal tagging (0, no tag; 1, 3xHA; 2, GFP; 3, TAP); and l stands for C-terminal tagging (0, no tag; 1, 3xHA; 2, GFP; 3, TAP) (Table 2 and Figure 3). All destination vectors are available from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org).",

UME6 encodes a transcription factor whose overexpression has been shown to force filamentation in C. albicans (51,52). The validation criteria for the destination vectors were (i) success of the LR reaction, (ii) integration in the C. albicans genome at the RPS1 locus, (iii) filamentation phenotype and/or (iv) detection of the 3xHA- or TAP-tagged Ume6 protein by western blot. The LR reaction was successfully used to transfer UME6 from the pDONR207::UME6 plasmid to all 15 destination vectors. The resulting expression plasmids were successfully integrated at the C. albicans RPS1 locus. The five strains containing PTET were induced overnight at 30\u00b0C by adding 3 \u03bcg/ml anhydrotetracycline (ATc3) to the culture medium, while the 10 strains containing PTDH3were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in YPD. As previously described (12,51,52), overexpression of Ume6 led to hyperfilamentation. This phenotype was observed for all strains, regardless of the tag used (Figure 4A and B). Nevertheless, the C-terminal TAP-tag appeared to hinder Ume6 function. Indeed, protein tags can potentially alter protein localization and/or protein function. One strength of our system is that it provides a choice of tagging, that could minimize the effect of the tag on a specific protein function. 3xHA- or TAP-tagged Ume6 was detected in the relevant strains and under the appropriate growth conditions (Figure 5A and B). We noticed extra bands migrating faster than the 3HA-tagged Ume6 protein, which are likely to result from protein degradation. The 3HA-tagged Ume6 protein was extracted by resuspending the cells in 2\u00d7 Laemmli sample buffer and boiling at 100\u00b0C for 10 min. This rapid protocol might be responsible for the observed protein degradation.",

The Candida 2H (C2H) system was developed for targeted one to one protein\u2013protein interaction detection (33). Hence, there was a need to engineer the system for high throughput screening based on rapid and convenient recombination cloning systems for the generation of prey/bait arrays of proteins, and to use a mating approach to circumvent the low efficiency of transformation of this fungus. The former was obtained by adapting the prey and bait recipient vectors for Gateway\u2122-mediated transfer of the ORFeome library, yielding pC2HB-GC and pC2HP-GC, respectively. The latter involved the combined processes of white-opaque switching and the preparation of mating-compatible 2H strains. The pleiomorphic fungus C. albicans is characterized by a parasexual cycle, with the possible mating of diploids, and generation of tetraploids, the absence of meiosis and the reversion to the diploid state by chromosome loss (reviewed in (53)). An essential pre-requisite to mating in C. albicans is the phenotypic switch from white to opaque, a stable but reversible switch regulated by environmental stimuli such as low temperatures, carbon dioxide and nutrients. The epigenetic switch is tightly linked to mating since the a1/\u03b12 complex, encoded at the mating type like (MTL) loci, acts as a repressor of opaque switching (54). In that context, the two-hybrid strain SC2H3 originating from the diploid a/\u03b1 SN152 strain (55) was deleted for the MTLa or MTL\u03b1 locus to construct SC2H3\u03b1 and SC2H3a strains. The efficient switch to opaque in the hemizygote strains was achieved by the doxycycline-controlled expression of WOR1, a major regulator of the white to opaque switch (43,56).",

Mating of the resulting transformants was achieved through selection for leucine and arginine prototrophy. Upon interaction of the two proteins, the reconstituted transcriptional module promoted the expression of the HIS1 marker, allowing only the mating-derived strains to grow on histidine-free medium, whereas the original diploid strains could not (Figure 6B). It is possible that some strains reverted to the diploid state, but we did not perform FACS analysis to assess this as it is not relevant for the protein\u2013protein interaction analysis. All transformants were able to grow in the absence of arginine and leucine, indicating the presence of the prey and bait vectors respectively.

            "text": "In eukaryotes, ORFeomes are usually cloned from full-length cDNA libraries to account for the presence of introns and therefore splicing variants. However, only 6% of C. albicans genes have introns (58), rendering the generation of the C. albicans ORFeome more straightforward than for pluricellular eukaryotes. Indeed, ORFs were simply amplified from the genomic DNA of the reference strain SC5314 and therefore, 360 ORFs in the C. albicans ORFeomeV2 harbor introns, a matter that should be taken into consideration when expressing ORFs in a prokaryotic host and, possibly, eukaryotic hosts other than C. albicans. A second aspect to be taken into consideration when using the ORFeome in hosts other than C. albicans is the unusual codon usage in this species (59). Indeed, in C. albicans, CUG is decoded as a serine instead of a leucine the majority of the time. Hence, improper translation in hosts with a standard genetic code may distort protein structure and function.",

Previous studies have reported mutation rates in primers of 3\u201310% (27,30). Similar rates were observed in this work. Unlike other Gateway\u2122 recombinational cloning projects (16,30), we did not see major differences in cloning efficiency for ORFs up to 4 kb. A decrease in success rate was observed only for ORFs >4 kb. This size bias could be attributed to an increased difficulty to amplify the ORF by PCR, a reduced efficiency of the Gateway\u2122 BP Clonase\u2122 reactions with long PCR products, and the error rate of the PCR polymerase, which increases with longer products. In addition, we also corrected the sequences of 110 ORFs with sequence ambiguities (N-tracts and IUPAC code nucleotides) according to the Candida Genome Database and identified 116 ORFs that display a recombinant haplotype. Recombinant haplotypes could be explained by template switching during PCR cycles or by incorrectly phased SNPs in reference sequences. This could be addressed by performing long-read sequencing of the C. albicans SC5314 genome.",

Because functional differences have been reported between the two alleles of a heterozygous gene (60\u201362), it would be relevant to also clone and validate the second allele in these instances. In addition, oligonucleotides have been designed based on annotation of the haploid set of Assembly 19 of the C. albicans genome. As a consequence, genes of the MTL\u03b1 locus have not been included in the ORFeome. Despite our efforts, the collection is still missing 1081 clones.

            "text": "ORFeomes are essential to bridge the gap between genome annotation and systems biology and allow large-scale gene and protein characterization. The development of a collection of C. albicans constitutive or conditional overexpression strains is one of the applications of the C. albicans ORFeome that we have successfully explored (12,32,57). In this respect, the C. albicans ORFeome project is currently completing its second and third phases, which consist of transferring the 5099 cloned ORFs into barcoded destination vectors and generating a collection of C. albicans barcoded overexpression mutants, each mutant carrying one of the 5099 cloned ORFs under the control of the inducible PTET promoter. CandidaOrfDB already provides information on the available overexpression plasmids and strains. In this study, we have paved the way for a second application of the C. albicans ORFeome through the development of tools for a 2H matrix approach of protein\u2013protein interaction detection via mating in C. albicans. Our data show that mating of diploid C. albicans expressing a bait fused to the LexA DNA binding domain and a prey fused to the VP16 activation domain, respectively, allows protein\u2013protein interactions to be tested. In S. cerevisiae, large-scale 2H screens can be performed in a matrix design whereby haploid strains expressing baits and preys are mated and protein-protein interactions are scored in the resulting diploids. Our toolkit now enables the implementation of such a matrix design for large-scale 2H screens in C. albicans. To this aim, a collection of 1500 prey clones has already been generated. As mentioned above, C. albicans codon usage is unusual, which limits the development of applications of the C. albicans ORFeome in species that use standard decoding such as S. cerevisiae. Our development of tools for large-scale 2H screens in C. albicans circumvents this limitation, opening the path for the characterization of the C. albicans interactome. Defining the C. albicans interactome will undoubtedly impact our understanding of C. albicans pathogenesis in humans.",
