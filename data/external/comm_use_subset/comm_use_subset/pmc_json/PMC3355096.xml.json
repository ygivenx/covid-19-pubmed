In vitro, however, response to RNA viruses is heterogeneous, since Sindbis virus (SINV), do not elicit detectable IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in infected of murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [13]. The specific points of blockage of type-I IFN production during infection are still not well delineated, but SINV and other alphaviruses could antagonize IFN production by shut-off of host macromolecular synthesis in infected cells [14], [15], [16]. Recently, human fibroblasts infection by CHIKV was shown to trigger abundant IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA transcription, while preventing mRNA translation and secretion of these antiviral cytokines [13], [15]. Contrasting with these reports, other groups using different CHIKV strains have observed abundant type-I IFNs release in the culture supernatants of CHIKV-infected human monocytes [17], human lung cells (MRC-5), human foreskin fibroblasts and MEFs [10]. Type-I IFN stimulation of non-hematopoietic cells has also been shown to be essential to clear infection upon CHIKV inoculation in mouse, but CHIKV was found to be a poor inducer of IFN secretion by human plasmacyto\u00efd dendritic cells [10]. Thus, great disparities regarding alphavirus-triggered IFN responses exist between viral strains and the nature of host cells or animal models.",

These different genes participate in the cellular defense against the viral infection. PKR is a serine\u2013threonine kinase that binds dsRNA in its N-terminal regulatory region and induces phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2\u03b1) on serine 51 [19], [20], leading to protein synthesis shut-off and apoptosis. PKR has been also been shown to participate in several important signaling cascades, including the p38 and JNK pathways [21], as well as type-I IFN production [22], [23]. Inhibition of translation, IFN responses and triggering of apoptosis combine to make PKR a powerful antiviral molecule, and many viruses have evolved strategies to antagonize it [24], [25]. Interestingly, several positive RNA-strand viruses (eg. Togaviridae or Picornaviridae) have been shown to activate PKR, resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and host translation arrest [26], while viral mRNA could initiate translation in an eIF2-independent manner by means of a dedicated RNA structure, that stalls the scanning 40S ribosome on the initiation codon [25].",

            "text": "Despite the existence of these viral PKR-evading strategies, the importance of PKR for type-I IFN production has been strongly debated over the years and even considered dispensable since the discovery of the innate immunity function of the DExD/H box RNA helicases [27], [28]. However, several PKR-deficient cell types have reduced type-I IFN production in response to poly I:C [23], [29], [30], while PKR was demonstrated to be required for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production in response to a subset of RNA viruses including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, West Nile (WNV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), but not influenza, Newcastle disease, nor Sendai virus [31], [32], [33], [34]. These studies raise therefore the possibility that some but not all viruses induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in a PKR-dependent and cell specific manner. Infection of PKR or RNAse L deficient mice demonstrated that these enzymes were not absolutely necessary for type I IFN-mediated protection from alphaviruses such as SFV or WNV, but still contributed to levels of serum IFN and clearance of infectious virus from the central nervous system [25], [35]. Similarly, deficient mice for both PKR and RNAse L showed no increase in morbidity following SINV infection, although, like during WNV infection, increased viral loads in draining lymph nodes were observed [35], [36]. These observations support a non-redundant and cell specific role for these enzymes in the amplification of type-I IFN responses to viral infection more than in their initiation [31], [32], [35]. Nevertheless, the exacerbated phenotypes observed upon alphavirus infection of mice deficient for type-I IFN receptor (IFNAR), underlines the limits of the individual contributions of PKR and RNAse L to the anti-viral resistance of adult animals [10], [35], [36].",

To date, four kinases have been identified to mediate eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation: PKR, PERK (protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase) [38], GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2) [39], [40] and HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor) [41], [42]. ER stress\u2013mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is carried out by PERK, which is activated by an excess of unfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lumen [38]. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, attenuating protein synthesis and triggering the translation of specific molecules such as the transcription factor ATF4, which is necessary to mount part of a particular ISR, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) [43], [44]. Interestingly DNA viruses, such as HSV, that use the ER as a part of its replication cycle, have been reported to interfere with the ER stress response through different mechanisms, such as the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by the viral phosphatase 1 activator, ICP34.5 [45], [46].",

During the course of this response, ATF4 and its downstream target, the phosphatase-1 (PP1) cofactor, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34, also known as MyD116 and Ppp1r15a) [48], are strongly up-regulated. Importantly, although the translation of most mRNAs is strongly inhibited by poly I:C, that of IFN-\u00df and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considerably increased under these conditions. We further demonstrate that PKR-dependent expression of GADD34 is critically required for the normal translation of IFN-\u00df and IL-6 mRNAs. We prove the relevance of these observations for antiviral responses using CHIKV as a model: we show that GADD34-deficient MEFs are unable to produce IFN-\u00df during infection and become permissive to CHIKV. We further show that CHIKV induces 100% lethality in 12-day-old GADD34-deficient mice, whereas WT controls do not succumb to infection. Our observations demonstrate that induction of GADD34 is part of the anti-viral response and imply the existence of distinct and segregated groups of mRNA, which require GADD34 for their efficient translation upon dsRNA-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation.",

In MEFs, a strong eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation was observed after 4 h of poly I:C treatment, followed by a steady dephosphorylation at later times (Fig. 1A). Protein synthesis arrest was confirmed in individual cells by concomitant imaging of poly I:C delivery, mRNA translation and P-eIF2\u03b1 (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B), and with a wide range of dsRNA concentrations (Fig. S1C). Poly I:C-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent translation arrest were not observed in PKR-deficient MEFs (Fig. 1C and 1D), while eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induced by the UPR-inducing drug thapsigargin (th) (an inhibitor of SERCA ATPases) or arsenite (as) was unchanged in PKR\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 1C).

To prove that IFN-\u03b2 production truly occurred during this poly I:C-induced translation arrest, cells exposed for 7 h to poly I:C were washed and old culture supernatants replaced with fresh media for 1 h (with or without CHX), prior translation monitoring (Fig. 1F, right) and IFN-\u00df dosage (Fig. 1G, right). We observed that close to 30% of the total IFN-\u00df produced over 8 h of poly I:C stimulation is achieved during this 1 h period, despite a close to undetectable protein synthesis in the dsRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1F). The neo synthetic nature of this IFN was further demonstrated by the absence of the cytokine in CHX-treated cell supernatants. IFN-\u03b2 production in response to poly I:C is therefore likely to be specifically regulated and occurs to a large extent independently of the globally repressed translational context. As previously observed in MEFs, IFN-\u00df production in response to poly I:C was independent of PKR (Fig. 1E) [31]. This suggests that although its production occurs during cap-mediated translation inhibition, it does not directly depend on a specialized open reading frame organization, as described for the translation of the mRNAs coding for the UPR transcription factor ATF4 or the SV 26S mRNA upon eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [26], [49]. This hypothesis is also supported by the ability of MEFs expressing the non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1 Ser51 to Ala mutant (eIF2\u03b1 A/A), to produce normal levels of IFN-\u00df in response to poly I:C (Fig. 1E), while global translation was not inhibited by poly I:C in these cells (Fig. S2).",

However, in absence of ATF4, MEFs were unable to efficiently induce GADD34 mRNA transcription in response to any of the stimuli tested (Fig. S3). GADD34 mRNA expression was induced only 2 fold in ATF4\u2212/\u2212 MEFs exposed to poly I:C, suggesting that its transcription is mostly dependent on ATF4 in this context. We further investigated P-eIF2\u03b1 requirement for GADD34 expression and found that eIF2\u03b1 A/A expressing MEFs were incapable of up-regulating GADD34 in response to poly I:C (Fig. 2C).

Poly I:C, however, nearly completely inhibited translation despite active eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation. This was particularly obvious when poly I:C was co-administrated together with thapsigargin. Indeed, poly I:C dominated the response by preventing the translation recovery normally observed after few hours of drug treatment (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, in absence of functional GADD34, although eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation induction by poly I:C was augmented dramatically, no further decrease in protein synthesis was observed upon treatment of GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells with the dsRNA mimic (Fig. 3A and 3C). The functionality of GADD34 in translation restoration was, however, fully demonstrated, when the same cells were treated with thapsigargin, and protein synthesis was completely inhibited by this treatment [52] (Fig. 3C). Thus, cytosolic dsRNA delivery induces a type of protein synthesis inhibition, which requires eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation for its initiation, but conversely cannot be reverted by GADD34 induction and subsequent GADD34-dependent eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation.",

Cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor was chosen as a model protein, since its secretion ensures a relative short intracellular residency time so that its intracellular levels directly reflect its synthesis rate [55]. This is confirmed by the N-glycosylated- and total Cystatin C accumulation in cells treated with brefeldin A (Fig. 4A, left panel). Cystatin C levels were found to follow a similar trend to that observed with total translation, being strongly reduced upon poly I:C exposure and not profoundly influenced by GADD34 inactivation (Fig. 4A, right panel). Thapsigargin treatment induced a brief drop in cystatin C levels, prior to some levels of GADD34-dependent recovery. 6 hours of tunicamycin treatment affected more cystatin C accumulation than anticipated (Fig. 4A, right panel), probably due to interference with the N-glycosylation and associated folding of this di-sulfide bridge containing protein [55], thereby promoting its degradation by endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) [56].",

As expected from its IFN-inducible transcription, levels of PKR were increased in poly I:C-treated MEFs (Fig. 4B), despite the strong global translation inhibition observed in these cells (Fig. 3). GADD34 inactivation appeared to influence the accumulation of PKR, since the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor levels were not up-regulated and even decreased in poly I:C-treated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 4B). Control treatment with tunicamycin and thapsigargin did not alter significantly PKR levels (Fig. 4B), suggesting that ER stress did not influence the kinase expression. The absence of PKR up-regulation in the poly I:C-treated GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs led us to investigate the capacity of these cells to produce anti-viral and inflammatory cytokines, which normally drive PKR expression through an autocrine loop. We ruled out any interference from the UPR in triggering IFN-\u00df production in our experimental system, since, as anticipated from PKR expression, tunicamycin and thapsigargin treatments were not sufficient to promote cytokine production in MEFs (Fig. S6) [43], [44].",

Even though IFN-\u03b1/\u00df mRNA induction is normal in PKR-deficient cells, a high proportion of mRNA transcripts lack their poly(A) tail [31]. As GADD34 induction by poly I:C was completely PKR-dependent, we wondered whether the phenotypes observed in PKR\u2212/\u2212cells and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs could be related. Oligo-dT purified mRNA extracted from cells exposed to poly I:C were therefore analyzed by qPCR. PolyA+ mRNAs coding for IFN-\u00df and IL-6 were equivalently purified and amplified from WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. S9). This confirms that albeit the phenotypes of PKR\u2212/\u2212 and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells might be linked, mRNA instability is not the primary cause of the cytokine production defect observed in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C. Taken together these observations suggest the existence of a specific mRNAs pool, encompassing cardinal immune effectors such as IFN-\u00df, IL-6, and PKR, which are specifically translated in response to dsRNA sensing and increased levels of P-eIF2\u03b1. This mRNAs pool requires GADD34 for their translation during the global protein synthesis shut-down triggered by dsRNA detection.",

Importantly, mice with one copy of the IFN-\u03b1/\u00df receptor (IFNAR) gene develop a mild disease, strengthening the implication of type-I IFN signaling in the control of CHIKV replication [59].

Productive infection was estimated by GFP expression (Fig. 5A, left panel), while culture supernatants were monitored for the presence of IFN-\u03b2 (5A, right panel). PKR was found to be necessary to control CHIKV infection in vitro, since at least 60% of PKR\u2013inactivated cells were infected after 24 of viral exposure, compared to only 15% in the control fibroblasts population. WT MEFs produced efficiently IFN-\u03b2, while the hypersensitivity to infection of the PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs was correlated to a reduced type-I IFN production capacity after infection. Thus, during CHIKV infection, PKR is required for normal IFN production by MEFs. We also monitored protein synthesis in infected WT and PKR\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts using puromycin labeling followed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Fig. 5B). CHIKV-GFP positive PKR\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were found to incorporate efficiently puromycin, while in their infected WT counterpart protein synthesis was efficiently inhibited. Thus CHIKV, in this experimental model, induces a PKR-dependent protein synthesis inhibition and is therefore particularly relevant to further confirm our observations on the role of GADD34 in controlling type-I IFN production during response to viral RNAs.",

The GADD34-inactivated cells were clearly more sensitive to CHIKV, displaying a 50% infection rate after 24 h of infection (MOI 50) and a log more of virus titer in culture supernatants (Fig. 6A, right). Correlated with their susceptibility to CHIKV infection, IFN-\u03b2 production was nearly undetectable in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs (Fig. 6B). Such observation confirms the incapacity of GADD34-deficient cells to produce cytokines in response to cytosolic dsRNA, a deficiency likely to facilitate viral replication. This interpretation is further supported by the abrogation of viral replication in both WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs briefly treated with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 6C). Thus, GADD34 inactivation does not favor viral replication per se, but is critical for type-I IFN production. Interestingly infection levels were found to be higher in PKR\u2212/\u2212 than in GADD34 \u0394C/\u0394C MEFs, although this difference could be attributed to clonal MEFs variation, it more likely suggests that PKR-dependent translation arrest could be key in preventing early viral replication in this system. In addition, the relatively lower permissivity of GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs to infection at high MOI could indicate the existence of GADD34-dependent defense mechanisms, which could be independent from IFN production and eIF2-\u03b1 dephosphorylation. To strengthen and generalize these observations, we treated a different strain of WT MEFs with guanabenz and examined the consequences for CHIKV infection. Biochemically, GADD34 expression was induced upon CHIKV infection, and guanabenz treatment resulted in a clear increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, demonstrating the importance of GADD34 in limiting this process during infection (Fig. 6D, right). As observed with GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C cells, pharmacological and RNAi inhibition of GADD34 was found to increase significantly the sensitivity of MEFs to infection, while reducing their IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 6D and S10). Thus, induction of GADD34 and its phosphatase activity during CHIKV infection, in vitro, participates to normal type-I IFN production and control of viral dissemination.",

Thus, GADD34 deficiency does not annihilate all the sources of type-I IFN in the infected adult animals, a situation exemplified by the capacity of GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C bone-marrow derived dendritic cells to produce reduced, but measurable IFN-\u03b2 in response to poly I:C [60].

GADD34 function was therefore evaluated in this more sensitive context by injecting intradermally CHIKV to FVB (WT) and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C neonatal mice. As previously observed for C57/BL6 mice [59], when CHIKV was inoculated to FVB neonates, a rate of 50% of mortality was observed 3 days after the infection of 9-day-old mice, while 12-day-old pups were found essentially resistant to the virus lethal effect (Fig. 7A). Strongly contrasting with these results, all CHIKV infected GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C neonates died within 3\u20135 days post inoculation whatever their age (Fig. 7A). When infection was monitored 5 days post-inoculation of 12-day-old mice at, GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C pups displayed considerably more elevated CHIKV titers (10\u2013100 folds) in most organs tested, including liver, muscle, spleen and joints, the later being primarily targeted by the virus (Fig. 7B, left). As expected, and in full agreement with the in vitro data, infected GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C tissues showed a considerably reduced IFN-\u00df production (40\u201350%) compared to control tissues (Figure 7B, right), while serum levels were reduced by 20% (not shown). Although Infectious virus was poorly detected in the heart of WT animals, elevated titers of virus were observed in the heart of GADD34-deficient pups, matching the limited production of IFN in this organ. We further investigated the possible pathological consequences of cardiac tissue infection by carrying-out comparative histopathology. Hearts of infected GADD34-deficient animals displayed severe cardiomyocytes necrosis with inflammatory infiltrates by monocytes/macrophages and very important calcium deposition (Fig. 8), all being indicative signs of grave necrotic myocarditis. As a consequence, the left ventricles were strongly dilated, being probably the cause of acute cardiac failures and of the important death rate observed in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C infected pups. Histology of infected FVB mice hearts was, however, normal with only few inflammatory cells (mainly lymphocytes) observed in the close vicinity of capillaries.",

We demonstrate here that the activation of PKR by cytosolic dsRNA results in a stress response, leading to ATF4 and GADD34 induction. GADD34 expression has been observed during the infection of cells by different types of viruses [62] or intracellular bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes\n[63]. Our observations demonstrate that GADD34 expression is a direct consequence of PKR activation and dsRNA sensing. Interestingly, although GADD34 induction by poly I:C promotes eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, this is not sufficient to prevent global protein synthesis arrest. The uncoupling of efficient eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation from global translation recovery in response to cytosolic poly I:C implies therefore the existence of additional mechanisms inhibiting global translation. The 2-5A/RNAse L pathway does not seem to be sufficiently active in our experimental setting to explain this prolonged protein synthesis inhibition. The cleavage or the inactivation of other translation factors could work in concert with eIF2\u03b1 to block or affect the efficiency of other individual steps of mRNA translation [64]. For instance, the phosphorylation of translation elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) is also controlled by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Thus, Thr56 phosphorylation of eEF-2, which is known to inhibit its translational function by reducing its affinity for ribosomes, could contribute directly to the protein synthesis inhibition induced by PKR activation [65]. Independently of general protein synthesis inhibition, eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation is necessary for the production of specific proteins upon dsRNA-induced translation inhibition. As demonstrated for ATF4, translation of a given mRNA during stress could rely on the structure and organization of its coding sequence, as well as the presence of multiple alternative initiation codons [49]. Surprisingly, functional GADD34 expression was found necessary for the translation of IL-6, IFN-\u03b2, and PKR. This observation points to the existence of a distinct group of mRNAs efficiently translated upon dsRNA detection and dependent on GADD34 activity.",

The strong eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation mediated by PKR in response to poly I:C or viral infection and leading to the initiation of translation inhibition, could be circumvented through GADD34 activity solely at the ER level, thereby allowing local cytokine production in absence of other functional protein synthesis. This selectivity for translation of several specific mRNAs among other ER-secreted molecules suggests further that GADD34 dependent mRNAs might display specific features allowing their efficient identification by GADD34 and associated molecules, as well as allowing their translation in presence of minimal levels of active guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B.",

Our observations, however, suggest that PKR function should be re-evaluated by integrating the impact of viral detection on cellular translation. In eIF2A/A and PKR\u2212/\u2212 cells, cytokine transcription is induced normally following poly I:C detection by DExD/H box RNA helicases, while as expected in these cells, no eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent host translation inhibition are observed. This lack of translation arrest in the absence of potent eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation allows for normal cytokine production during dsRNA detection, with no requirement for an operational GADD34 feedback loop. The importance of PKR and GADD34 for IFN-\u03b2 and other cytokines production could therefore be directly linked to the efficiency of the cellular translation inhibition induced by RNA viruses, as exemplified here with CHIKV, which in MEFs strongly activates PKR and subsequent protein synthesis inhibition.",

CHIKV cardiac tropism is not normally observed in WT mouse and inability of heart tissues to produce sufficient type-I IFN in GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C could allow abnormally high viral replication, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. Interestingly many cases of myopericarditis induced by CHIKV and leading to dilated cardiomyopathies in infected patients have been reported since the 1970s after the different western Indian Ocean islands and Indian subcontinent disease outbreaks [68], [69]. These particular symptoms and complications might therefore be the consequences of great variation in the tissue-specific type-I IFN levels induced in CHIKV-infected patients, who might display particular polymorphisms in their innate viral sensing pathways increasing their peculiar susceptibility to viral dissemination in the heart.",

Similarly, several laboratories have reported that TLR stimulation activates the XBP-1 branch of the UPR and that XBP-1 production was needed to promote a sustained production of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6 [71], [72]. Here, we identify GADD34 as a novel functional link between ISR and PAMPs detection in MEFs, required for the production of cytokines including type-I IFN. It will now be important to explore the therapeutic potential of targeting GADD34 to reduce cytokines overproduction during inflammatory conditions.",

C) Amount of IFN-\u03b2 (left panel) and IL-6 (right panel) in cell culture supernatants of WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs after 6 h of poly I:C stimulation. Mock are samples treated with lipofectamine alone. Data are mean \u00b1 standard deviation of five (IFN-\u03b2) and three (IL-6) independent experiments. D) Transcription of IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, PKR and Cystatin C was analyzed by qPCR in samples of WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs treated with poly I:C (pI:C). Mock represent samples treated with lipofectamine alone. E) WT and GADD34\u0394C/\u0394C MEFs were transfected overnight with an expression plasmid carrying the murine GADD34 (G34) cDNA and then treated with poly I:C for 6 h. IFN-\u03b2 production was quantified by ELISA, left panel, in cell culture supernatants and plotted as a ratio of IFN-\u03b2 to total cell proteins to compensate for different cell mortality levels induced by the transfection. In the right panel immunoblots for GADD34 and P-eIF2\u03b1 in the same experimental conditions are shown. One representative analysis of 3 independent experiments is shown.",

GFP-CHIKV positive (green) were visualized by confocal microscopy after staining with specific antibodies for puromycin (cyan) and phospho-eIF2\u03b1 (red). Cell Nuclei are stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue). Infection by CHIKV inhibits protein synthesis (visualized by puromycin incorporation) in WT, but not in PKR-deficient cells (arrows). In WT MEFs, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation levels correlate with translation inhibition, although variability is observed among different infected cells, presumably due to GADD34 activity and time of infection. Non-infected WT and PKR\u2212/\u2212 cells serve as a reference for normal translation activity and are indicated by an arrowhead. Scale bar 10 \u00b5m.",
