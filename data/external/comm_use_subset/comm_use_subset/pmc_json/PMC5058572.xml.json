Early attempts at computerized analysis of medical images were made in the 1960s, such as diagnosis of primary bone tumor [1] and detection of abnormalities in mammograms [2]. In the 1980s a new concept emerged, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) which assumed that the computer output could be utilized to assist physicians, but not to replace them. Currently, CAD systems are employed in the early detection of pathologies, that is, to obtain a \u201csecond opinion\u201d and help them make the final decision [3\u20136]. A CAD system can also be very useful to provide some basic information when the human expert monitoring is not possible.",

Related to thoracic medical imaging, attention is directed particularly to the lungs [8, 23, 24], the lung fields, the heart and the clavicles [25], certain lung structures as hilar region [26], and the liver and neighboring abdominal organs [10, 11]; the latter two methods do not use simple radiographs, but other 3D image modalities such as CT and MRI.

Another interesting work is [30] that used computed tomographies (CT) for the problem of lung texture recognition. They used a LBP operator extended to 3D, performing a comparison of LBP histograms. These authors also presented a texture classification-based system for emphysema quantification in CT images comprising three classes: normal tissue, centrilobular emphysema, and paraseptal emphysema [31].

Let us consider a single channel image, I, with an arbitrary photometric resolution. The LBP computation for a pixel I(x, y) takes into account the 8 pixels surrounding point (x, y), using the following equation:(1)LBPx,y=\u2211n=072ntIx,y\u2212Ineighn,x,y,with  tv=0,v\u226501,v<0,where neigh iterates the neighbors of pixel (x, y), that is, {(x \u2212 1, y \u2212 1), (x, y \u2212 1), (x + 1, y \u2212 1), (x \u2212 1, y), (x + 1, y), (x \u2212 1, y + 1), (x, y + 1), (x + 1, y + 1)}, and t(v) is a function that thresholds its parameter v.

The 24 LBP histograms of all the images are computed (both training set and I). Then, each histogram of I is compared with n corresponding histograms in T using (3). After that, the difference between the minimum distance to the normal radiographs of T and the minimum distance to the pathological radiographs of T is computed. That is, the system calculates for each region R in image I:(4)vR=mino\u2208normal\u2061 dHRI,HRTo\u2212minp\u2208pathologic\u2061 dHRI,HRTp,where normal is the set of normal radiographies in T and pathologic is the set of pathologic ones. The values v(R) can be interpreted as votes to either normality or pathology; a high negative value should be obtained for regions similar to the normal samples and a high positive value for the nonnormal samples. Therefore, the set of 24 values, {v(1), v(2),\u2026, v(24)}, provides information that has to be combined in a final classification. Three different approaches are proposed for this purpose:(1)\nGDAV: Greater Difference in Absolute Value. This technique consists of obtaining the maximum value of |v(R)| for all R in {1,2,\u2026, 24}. If the corresponding v(R) is a negative number, then image I is classified as normal; otherwise, it is classified as pathologic. This method considers that the region which has a greater difference is the one that contains most information for the problem.(2)\nDV: Discrete Voting. In this case, all regions contribute to the final classification. The sign of each v(R) is considered as a vote to normality (negative sign) or to pathology (positive sign). The class with the most votes provides the final classification for I.(3)\nCV: Continuous Voting. A potential drawback of DV method is that relevant information can be lost when discretizing the values of v(R). To avoid this problem, CV takes the sum v(1) + v(2)+\u22ef+v(24). If the sum is positive, image I is considered as pathologic and otherwise normal. In fact, the optimum decision threshold is not necessarily 0, but it can be slightly biased. This threshold determines the compromise between false positive and false negative errors.\n",

In order to be introduced in the context of a hospital, a better accuracy would be required. One disadvantage of the proposed approach is that it requires a large number of images, in order to have enough samples of all appearances for different sex, age, kinds of pathologies, and so forth. Therefore, a large set of chest radiographs would be needed to improve the results. Moreover, as discussed above, these images should be marked more precisely with the areas of pathology. Another limitation of the method is that it relies only on texture information. Some types of diseases, for example, affecting only the intensity of the images, would not be detected. To overcome this issue, the combination of other image descriptors could be applied, such as scale-invariant features or deep learning methods. In any case, we have to recall that these kinds of systems are designed to help radiologists, not to replace them.",
