Since the 2013\u20132016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in western Africa, the United States National Academy of Medicine1 and several other groups2\u20134 have pointed to gaps, and the need for greater investment, in preparation against epidemics and pandemics, of Ebola virus disease and other infectious diseases. Attempts to justify greater investment have mostly been based on estimates of the industrial and macroeconomic losses attributable to influenza pandemics.5\u201311 We have recently extended the loss assessment to include a valuation of the lives lost as a result of the increases in mortality resulting from influenza-pandemic risk.12 The inclusion of such a valuation increased the estimated loss attributable to modelled pandemic risk several fold. Below, we discuss our method and summarize our findings. Box 1 presents the definition of several of the terms we are using in this paper.",

Almost all of the previous studies examined economic losses in terms of income and ignored the value of, and the loss associated with, mortality risk. The World Bank, for example, generated estimates of global income losses under different influenza pandemic scenarios.10,11 It found that a pandemic of the same severity as the 1918 influenza pandemic might reduce global gross domestic product by about 5% and that the disruptive effects of avoiding infection would account for about 60% of that reduction. Another study of the consequences of a range of pandemic severities included an extremely severe scenario that would lead to income losses of over 12% of gross national income worldwide, including losses of over 50% of the gross national incomes of lower-income countries.5 We found other integrative estimates of the magnitude of pandemic risk in two partially proprietary sources.17,18",

A closer examination of the data from India indicate that the true global rate was probably far higher than 1.1%, the pandemic led to 14 million deaths in India36\u201338 and it seems implausible that India accounted for 73% of all of the pandemic-related deaths at a time when it had 18% of the world population. However, to be conservative, we estimated an expected annual excess mortality rate of 0.93 SMUs. In the corresponding model for moderate pandemics, we used a global expected excess mortality rate of 0.05 SMUs, as seen in historical moderate pandemics.39",
