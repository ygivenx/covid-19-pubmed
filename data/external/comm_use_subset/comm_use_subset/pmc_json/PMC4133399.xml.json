The cell populations that are mainly targeted by the virus include mononuclear phagocytes (e.g. macrophages and monocytes) and T cells [1]. Several mechanisms of immune evasion and suppression have been described for the pathology of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [2], [3]. Regarding mononuclear phagocytes, studies implicated the importance of early genes, expressed by HIV-1 in advanced phases of infection, for immune manipulation [4], [5]. However, as these cells are hallmarks of innate immunity, there is also a requirement for immune manipulation at stages of viral entry and latency. Little is known about the ability of HIV-1 to modulate innate immune responses of these cells during its entry and latent stages, particularly against members of the Toll-Like receptor (TLR) family.",

TLRs are conserved membrane receptors that recognize a wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria, flagellin, in addition to intracellular molecules such as single-stranded DNA and RNA [8], [9]. To induce ligand recognition and subsequent signaling, the hetero-dimerization of TLR2 with TLR6 or TLR1 is required. This is coordinated through ligand binding to the extracellular regions of the proteins and conformational changes throughout the proteins [10], [11], [12]. The significance of the TLR2 and TLR6 TMDs in the regulation and activation of formation of the receptor complex and in downstream signaling has been recently described [13], revealing that activation of TLR2 increases resistance of macrophages to HIV-1 infection [14]. Interestingly, dendritic cells (DCs) infected with HIV-1 were reported to be less responsive via TLR upon expression of ENV on the membrane [15]. These emerging studies link the manipulation of TLR2 responses and HIV-1 pathogenesis through as yet unknown mechanisms.",

In addition to its fusogenic activity, the ENV protein binds proteins localized to membrane microdomains on macrophages and DCs. In addition, TLRs expressed on the cell membrane are recruited to cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains upon their ligand recognition, initiating signal transduction [16], [17]. ENV is also targeted to cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains through a well-defined localization signal located adjacent to its TMD. The TMD of ENV and its adjacent regions are extremely conserved among all clades currently reported of HIV-1, and are similar to the TMD of HIV-2 gp41 [18]. Interestingly, recent studies showed that TLR2 recognition of several viral related glycoproteins (gp) induces activation of an antiviral response [19]. Taken together, we hypothesized that the ENV plays a role in impairment of TLR-induced responses, contributing both to its evasion from recognition during the fusion process and to expropriate native TLR responses at latent stages, thus assisting in viral replication upon its initiation.",

            "text": "We synthesized a peptide derived from the N\u2032 terminus of the ENV TMD region (gp41 TMD) previously reported to be involved in cellular responses to viral infection [20]. Since this region harbors the well-defined GxxxG motif known to drive the assembly of TMDs [21], we also synthesized a peptide lacking this motif (gp41 mutant) (Table S1 in Text S1). We then utilized the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 to study the functionality of TLR2. We activated TLR2 by purified LTA that was recently shown to be regulated, at least in part, through interactions between the TMDs of TLR2 and TLR6 [13]. We measured the level of phosphorylated ERK1,2 upon treatment with LTA, as these are key regulators of the TLR signaling pathway. Figure 1A and B show that 20 minutes after addition of LTA to RAW cells that were pre-incubated with the gp41 TMD peptide, there was a significant decrease in ERK1,2 phosphorylation compared to non-treated cells, indicating less receptor activation. As a negative control, pre-incubation with the gp41 mutant peptide did not change the levels of phosphorylated ERK1,2. Noteworthy, since the cells in culture that respond through the TLRs also respond to endogenous signals, the basal level of phosphorylated ERK1,2 was also decreased by the gp41 TMD peptide but not by the mutant peptide (Figure 1A). We next measured the expression levels of NF\u03baB downstream genes; Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), a hallmark cytokine of TLR activation, and Monocyte Chemotactic Protein 1 (MCP-1), a major chemokine mainly secreted by macrophages [22], in order to ensure that the inhibitive effect on ERK1,2 phosphorylation is a result of inhibition of TLR2 signaling. Treatment of the cells with gp41 TMD peptide resulted in a 45% decrease in MCP1 mRNA expression levels compared to non-treated cells (Figure 1C). The treatment also resulted in a 72% decrease in the mRNA expression levels of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 1D). When cells were treated with the mutant peptide, only a 34% decrease in mRNA levels was detected for TNF\u03b1 (Figure 1C), and no significant change was detected for the expression levels of MCP-1 (Figure 1D). Altogether, it is clear that the association between the TMDs of gp41 and TLR2 functionally impacts receptor activity.",

The results show that the ENVTMD peptide attenuates the secretion of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 2A), IL-6 (Figure 2B) and MCP-1 (Figure 2C). However, and in line with the mRNA expression levels and phosphorylation inhibition, the gp41 mutant peptide did not decrease cytokine secretion. In order to validate that the effect observed is not limited to murine cells we evaluated the effect of the peptides on human THP-1 cells. We followed the secretion of TNF\u03b1 under the same conditions as for the mice cell line. The data show that the WT peptide had similar effect on human cells as in mice cells and that the mutant peptide did not affect the secretion levels of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 2D). These results suggest that incubation of gp41 TMD peptides with cells leads to inhibition of TLR2/6 signaling. Together, these results suggest a potential potent immunosuppressive effect of gp41 HIV-1 ENV protein via inhibition of TLR2 mediated signaling.",

We expressed two forms of the ENV protein, the full length gp160 and the transmembrane protein gp41. LTA responsiveness was compared to mock transfected cells (see materials and methods). LTA treatment resulted in elevated TNF\u03b1 secretion in mock cells, whereas gp160 expressing cells showed a reduction in TNF\u03b1 secretion. Furthermore, gp41 expressing cells showed even more reduction of TNF\u03b1 secretion almost to the basal level of the non-treated cells (Figure 3). The better efficiency of gp41 in inhibiting TNF\u03b1 secretion compared to gp160 can be in part due to the smaller size of its ectodomain compared to that of gp160. This should result in less hindrance upon its interaction with TLR2. We confirmed similar expression levels of HIV-1 gp160 and gp41, as they showed similar extracellular expression levels (see example in supplementary Figure S5 in Text S1). These data reveal that the fully processed ENV protein, once expressed on the cellular membrane, results in inhibition of TLR2 activation.",

Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p) with 100 \u00b5g of LTA and 700 mg/kg D-galactosamine (GLN), and were either treated intravenous (i.v.) with gp41 TMD peptide (5 mg/kg), mutated peptide (5 mg/kg) or PBS. Upon injection of LTA/GLN, 7/9 PBS-treated mice and 6/9 of the gp41 mutant treated mice died while only 2/9 of the gp41 TMD treated mice died (Figure 5A). Histological analysis of the liver indicated that LTA/GLN treatment resulted in massive parenchyma damage associated with hemorrhage in both PBS and gp41 mutant treated mice (Figure 5B). However in the gp41 TMD treated samples, the tissue resembled that of control mice (Figure 5B) with no observable tissue damage or hemorrhage. This was also evident from the external feature of the tissues themselves, showing that mice not treated with the ENV TMD peptides had enlarged and inflamed livers and spleens (Figure S3 in Text S1). We analyzed serum levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 as these cytokines are secreted by resident macrophages and blood monocytes in the LTA/GLN model [13]. In accordance with the survival rates, our results indicate that the blood serum levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 were significantly lower for the gp41 TMD peptide-treated group compared to the untreated group (Figure 6A and B, respectively). We therefore examined spleen, in order to test activation of the immune system. The effect of an uncontrolled inflammatory response may lead to secretion of high levels of steroids, leading to massive cell death in the lymphocyte zones [25]. LTA/GLN injection resulted in a large number of apoptotic cell foci in the white pulp and congestion throughout the tissue in comparison to control mice spleens (Figure 6C middle and top panels, respectively). Comparably, gp41 TMD treatment decreased apoptosis to levels similar to the na\u00efve samples (Figure 6C lower panel). Cell death was also detected in the red pulp of untreated mice and was absent from gp41 TMD treated mice. This result indicates that gp41 TMD decreased monocyte activation, resulting in less apoptosis in the spleen.",

Liver staining showed that the administration of LTA/GLN resulted in increase in Mac2 positive cells, in addition to the appearance of round-shaped Mac2 positive cells that could be either activated residential macrophages (kupffer cells) that phagocysed dead hepatocytes, or infiltrated activated monocytes (Figure 7A, white arrows). The mutant gp41 peptide treated mice resembled the PBS+LTA/GLN treated mice and showed a similar increase in Mac2 positive cells and the appearance of the round shaped Mac2 positive cells, while WT gp41 TMD peptide treated mice resembled control non-LTA administrated mice, showing low intensity staining of Mac2 positive cells, and significantly decreased number of the round-shaped cells (Figure 7A). Similarly, spleen staining with anti-Mac2 of PBS+LTA/GLN treated mice and of a mutant gp41 TMD peptide +LTA/GLN showed very high elevation of Mac2 positive cells. However, mice treated with WT gp41 TMD+LTA/GLN showed minor amount of Mac2 positive cells that resembled the non-treated control mice (Figure 7B).

            "text": "Recent studies show that peptides derived from TMDs of several membrane proteins interfere with their assembly and function [23], [27], [28]. We utilized this strategy to assess the ability of ENV to affect TLR2 activation, and to identify the important amino acids within the TMD that contribute to this interaction. It has been shown that the TMD of TLR2 regulates its function in response to natural and synthetic ligands. The ENV TMD possesses a GxxxG motif, which is well defined as a membrane dimerization motif. Interestingly, the TLR2 TMD also possesses such a sequence (Figure S3, boxed in Text S1). The precise conformational changes of the TLR2 TMD that induce its dimerization with its partners leading to signal transduction are not known. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the GxxxG motif of the TLR2 and TLR6 TMDs move in a piston mechanism (for an explanation on the piston motion, see Ref. [24]). This motion could explain how these motifs are important for the TLR function although they are not located parallel to each other within the membrane. Mutating the GxxxG motif significantly decreased the ability of the ENV TMD to inhibit macrophage responses to TLR2 ligands. This is expected because the peptides' mode of action is by inhibiting dimerization of TLR2 and TLR6 through interactions within the membrane milieu. Interestingly, the interaction of TMD sequences is not driven solely by the GxxxG motif, since the GpA TMD did not show any association with the TLR2 TMD. The specific nature of the interaction is demonstrated by the co-immunoprecipitation of TLR2 with the ENV TMD, while no interaction was detected with the mutated TMD. Overall, the data suggest that the ENV TMD interferes with the dimerization of TLR2/6 TMDs partially through their GxxxG motif. This subsequently leads to impaired complex signaling and to inhibition of cytokine secretion. The general effect of this inhibition is demonstrated by inhibition of the initial steps of signal transduction (ERK phosphorylation), as well as, by inhibition of an array of end point targets of TLR signaling (TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1) each transcribed in a different complex of NF\u03baB. Note that it has been shown that the GxxxG is important, but not sufficient, for helix-helix interactions within the membrane [21].",

            "text": "As CD4 and TLRs may reside in similar membrane environments [29], [30], and membrane-bound TLRs recognize viral glycoproteins, it is reasonable to assume that this leads to initiation of a response towards HIV-1 during fusion. Furthermore, activation of TLR signaling prior to HIV infection causes dendritic cells to be less permissive to infection [31]. Therefore, inhibiting the initial response towards the invading pathogen is a powerful tool to allow virus entry into the cell. An additional possible need for this inhibitory activity is at latent stages of viral infection. HIV-1 ENV and TLR2 both possess a membrane localization signal motif adjacent to their TMD (Figure S3 in Text S1). This signal motif determines the precise environment within the membrane in which the proteins reside. Although for T cells, ENV is expressed at low levels during latency, ENV expression levels on mononuclear phagocytes are high [32]. Several studies indicated the impairment of TLR signaling after viral infection and incorporation [5] which may assist in the establishment of infection by opportunistic bacteria and fungi, in addition to the loss of CD4+ T cells [33]. Together with our findings about the modulatory effect of ENV on TLR responses, this impairment may occur as a result of the interactions of the TMDs of ENV and TLRs, leading to the prevention of TLR activation upon ligand recognition. Noteworthy, several studies have linked the activation of TLR cascades to viral replication and burst. These studies focus on cells with established infection. This means that the virus successfully transmitted its genome into the cells and initiated the expression of its early genes [34]. In view of the small number of proteins expressed by the HIV genome, this immunosuppressive activity might exist with its fusogenic activity to help the virus to escape immune recognition and response towards it, prior to the activity of the viral early genes.",

            "text": "In summary, we demonstrate that the ENV TMD inhibits the activation of TLR2 signaling by interacting with its TMD. This property could be of great importance during fusion and serves as an additional mean of regulation of the activity of TLR at stages of Env expression. Our findings further demonstrate the complex strategies used by HIV-1 to manipulate the immune system. Interestingly, the ENV TMD is also involved in the late steps of the membrane fusion reaction. Such dual activity further demonstrates how viruses although expressing a limited number of proteins have evolved to alter so many cellular processes. Considering the strong ability of other gp41-derived segments to inhibit T-cell activation by various mechanisms, our study may indicate that these effects are also applicable to mononuclear phagocytes and additional targets should be further investigated. Apart from HIV pathogenesis, specific gp41 derived peptides may provide potential tools for treating uncontrolled immune responses, manifested here by sepsis.",

Briefly, Two plasmids are used in the assay containing either the wild-type LexA sequence (pBLM, encoding for resistance to Tetracycline) or a mutated form of LexA (pALM, encoding for resistance to Ampicillin). The desired TM sequences are inserted between these two protein sequences using standard cloning techniques. The resulting plasmids were both transformed into an SU202 E. coli strain, which then expressed the LexA-TM-MalE fusion proteins (after induction with 1 mM IPTG). Hetero-association of TM domains leads to the formation of LexAWT/LexAmut heterodimers that bind to a hybrid LexA promoter/operator in the reporter strain SU202 (that recognizes the mutant LexA domain), and repress the expression of \u03b2-gal. Furthermore, as the hybrid promoter is designed to bind only the wt and mutant heterodimers, it will not recognize wild-type LexA homodimers. Thus, TM homo-oligomer formation does not interfere with the measurement of hetero-association. The TMDs of GlycophorinA (GpA) and its G83I mutant, used as positive and negative controls, respectively, are ITLIIFGVMAGVIGTILLI and ITLIIFGVMAIVIGTILLI.
