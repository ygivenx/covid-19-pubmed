As benchtop vortexers do not provide a standardised approach for sample homogenisation, a tissue homogeniser was used. The mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were subjected to homogenisation at different speeds (3000 and 5000 rpm) and with or without beads of different sizes (\u00d80.1 and \u00d82.8 mm) and compared to a non-homogenised control (Fig. 2). Homogenisation with \u00d82.8 mm beads led to a destruction of viral particles irrespective of homogenisation speed. The reduction was largest for coronavirus (99.5% and 99.6% and Ct differences of 8.5 and 8.9 for 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively) and mimivirus (96.0% and 97.7% and Ct differences of 6.0 and 6.3 for 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively). In addition, \u00d82.8 mm beads led to a 316% and 350% increase in the detection of 16S rRNA at 5000 and 3000 rpm, respectively (Ct difference 2.3 and 2.4, respectively). For the bacteria, \u00d82.8 mm beads also showed increases ranging from 612% (3.2Ct decrease) for the Bacteroides to 6184% for the E.coli (6.1Ct decrease). Homogenisation at 5000 rpm (without beads or with \u00d80.1 mm beads) showed a larger reduction in viral particles than homogenisation at 3000 rpm. Reduction of viral particles was lowest using 3000 rpm homogenisation without beads (the maximum percentage of reduction was 59.6% for the pepino mosaic virus, 1.07Ct), and did not increase the amount of bacterial DNA/rRNA. All conditions resulted in well-homogenised suspensions suitable for subsequent filtration experiments (data not shown).",

Since this step differs greatly among studies242526, we decided to test a mild and medium centrifugal force (100 g and 17000 g, respectively) as well as short (3 min) and medium (30 min) centrifugation times on our mock-communities (Fig. 3). Higher g-forces or longer centrifugation times were not tested as this would result in even higher viral losses. Centrifugation at 100 g for 3 min showed limited differences compared to the control for viruses, bacteria and rRNA. Only for Lactobacillus a reduction of more than 1 Ct was observed (68.6%; 1.8Ct increase). Centrifugation for 30 min at 100 g, resulted in an increased reduction of mimivirus (94.6%; 4.5Ct). For the bacteria, the highest reductions were observed for the Lactobacillus (99.0%; 7Ct) and Bifidobacterium (96.0%; 5Ct), whereas E.coli and Bacteroides showed less pronounced reductions (80.6% or 2.4 Ct and 48% or 0.95 Ct, respectively). Centrifugation at 17000 g for both 3 and 30 min resulted in more than 99.99% reductions for Bifidobacterium, E.coli and Bacteroides. The reduction in Lactobacillus was slightly lower (99.7%\u201399.8%), whereas the reduction in the rRNA was 98.5\u201399.4%. For 3 minutes at 17000 g the losses for viruses were negligible, except for polyomavirus (43.3% loss, 1.2Ct), herpesvirus (65.3% loss, 1.3Ct), and especially mimivirus (96.9% loss, 5.4Ct). These findings were much more pronounced when centrifugation was performed at 17000 g for 30 minutes. Surprisingly, more than 90% reduction was observed for polyomavirus, coronavirus and herpesvirus, and 99.9% for mimivirus. Although the samples where thoroughly homogenised, it cannot be excluded that this observation is due to viral aggregates still present in the sample.",

Therefore, the mock-virome and bacterial mock-community were filtered with a 0.8-\u03bcm centrifugal filter (PES), a 0.8-\u03bcm polycarbonate filter (PC), a 0.45-\u03bcm centrifugal filter (PVDF) or a 0.22-\u03bcm centrifugal filter (PVDF) and compared with an unfiltered control (Fig. 4). Filtration with the two 0.8-\u03bcm and 0.45-\u03bcm filters showed limited effects on most of the viruses in the mock-virome, except for mimivirus, the largest virus in the mock-virome, for which a 81.7% (3.8Ct increase), a 95.9% (6.8Ct) and a 99.0% (9.9Ct) reduction was observed for the 0.8-\u03bcm PES, the 0.8-\u03bcm PC and 0.45-\u03bcm filters, respectively. The least mimivirus was recovered using the 0.22-\u03bcm filter (99.90% reduction, 13.95Ct), and also 82.0% (4.1Ct) reduction was observed for herpesvirus using the 0.22-\u03bcm filter. The use of the 0.8-\u03bcm PC filter resulted in a reduction of 99.1% (7.5Ct) and 99.2% (7.9Ct) for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, respectively, whereas E.coli (80.7%, 2.5Ct) and Bacteroides (50.1%, 1.04Ct) showed modest reductions. A much more efficient removal of bacteria was obtained with the 0.8-\u03bcm PES, 0.45-\u03bcm and 0.22-\u03bcm filters, removing 99.5% to 99.90% of all bacteria present in the bacterial mock-community.

            "text": "Chloroform disrupts lipid membranes and is often used to remove bacteria. However, some viruses are enveloped, and their capsid can become unstable after envelope removal. To determine the effects of chloroform, the mock-virome as well as the bacterial mock-community were incubated in the presence of 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% chloroform and compared with a non-chloroform exposed control sample. Incubation in 1% chloroform resulted in a reduction less than 1 Ct for all the enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, except for mimivirus showing a moderate loss of 53.2% (1.3Ct increase) (Fig. 5A). When incubating with higher percentages of chloroform (5\u201320%), no or very limited losses for circovirus, parvovirus, pepino mosaic virus and LIMEstone virus were observed. The highest reductions were observed for the enveloped coronavirus (range of reduction: 81.4\u201389.9%; 2.6\u20132.8Ct) and mimivirus (61.4\u201377%; 1.6\u20132.5Ct), and as well as for the non-enveloped rotavirus (range of reduction: 74\u201377%; 2.3\u20132.5Ct). In contrast, for the enveloped herpesvirus only 18.8\u201331.2% (0.38\u20130.69Ct) reduction was observed. Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to 1% chloroform, resulting in a decrease of 97.6\u201399.4% (6.1\u20137.9Ct) for Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, respectively, whereas Gram-negative bacteria were less affected with reductions below 90% (Fig. 5B). However, high concentrations of chloroform (10\u201320%) resulted in a substantial reduction of all bacterial species (99.6\u201399.999%; 8.8\u201317.6Ct). Finally, rRNA was reduced by 83.5\u201394.9% (2.9\u20134.8Ct), and only a limited effect was observed when the percentage of chloroform was changed (Fig. 5B).",

Furthermore, the low amount of genetic material from a sample often requires an amplification step. Amplification was performed using an adapted version of the Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit 2 (WTA2) to amplify both DNA and RNA. To determine bias introduced by amplification, the number of cycles was varied with 5-step intervals between 7 and 22 and compared with a non-amplified control. At 7 amplification cycles an increase of at least 374% (3.7-fold) was observed for all viruses in the mock-virome. A strong increase in the concentration of all viruses was observed at 12 (range 26\u2013808 fold increase) and 17 cycles (range 170\u20136466 fold increase), whereas at 22 cycles, 3 out of 9 viruses in the mock-virome showed lower yields than at 17 cycles. The same procedure was followed for the bacterial mock-community and bacterial amplification after 7 cycles for Lactobacillus, E.coli and Bacteroides ranged between 1061\u20132033%, and increased 5611% for rRNA (Fig. 6). An increase between 7844% and 19088% was observed for 12 amplification cycles, whereas rRNA increased to 14920%.

A combined artificial community of viruses and bacteria was subjected to the selected conditions and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2500\u2122. In the control sample sequencing data, 47.6%, 43.2% and 1.6% of the reads were attributed to bacteria, viruses and rRNA, respectively (Fig. 7A and Table S4). The unmapped reads obtained were attributed to residual host and bacterial DNA derived from the preparation of viral stocks, such as Dickeya solani and Chlamydiales. The use of the 0.8-\u03bcm PC filter resulted only in minor reduction in the percentage of reads mapping to bacteria (47.3%). The remaining filtering and/or centrifugation conditions resulted in a dramatic reduction in the percentage reads that mapped to bacteria (ranging from 0.39% to 0.71%), while the number of viral reads increased to 88.8\u201396.7%. The 0.8-\u03bcm PES filter plus centrifugation condition yielded the highest percentage of viral reads, of which most were attributed to pepino mosaic virus (33.9%), LIMEstone virus (32.9%) and rotavirus (20.6%) (Fig. 7B). When comparing the distribution of the viral reads of the control, the four protocols without centrifugation showed an expansion of the LIMEstone virus reads, mainly at the expense of rotavirus and pepino mosaic virus reads. Also, the combination of centrifugation with filtration showed a minimal increase of LIMEstone virus and pepino mosaic virus reads, but at the expense of parvovirus, polyomavirus and circovirus reads. The percentage of herpesvirus reads in the control was low (0.11%) and slightly increased with centrifugation plus 0.8-\u03bcm PES filter (0.18%). For the remaining conditions, herpesvirus reads ranged from 0.04% to 0.24%. The mimivirus viral reads in the control (0.91%) could only be increased when filtering with 0.8-\u03bcm PC filter (2.2%), but were strongly reduced when using the other protocols (0.011%\u20130.034%). Although nearly all bacteria were removed, the distribution of remaining bacterial sequence reads was dominated by Bacteroides in the control and 0.8-\u03bcm PC filter (41.3% and 43.5% of total reads, respectively), whereas in the remaining conditions E.coli was the most abundant (0.14\u20130.40%) (Fig. 7C and Table S4). The rRNA obtained reads were low for the control (1.59%) and reduced to 0.2%\u20130.004% for the treated conditions. Overall, a good correlation was observed between the number of viral copies as determined by qPCR and the percentage of mapped reads (R2 = 0.91). For most viruses a high correlation between 0.88 and 0.97 was observed, only for circovirus and herpesvirus the correlation was slightly lower (R2 = 0.75 and 0.63, respectively) (Fig. 7D). For parvovirus no correlation was observed (R2 = 0.16). No correlation for bacteria was calculated as the qPCR measurements for the bacteria after treatment were often below the detection limits of the used assays.",

Two replicates were processed in parallel and evaluated before and after the procedure (Fig. S1 and Table S5). Before the procedure, standard deviations ranged from 3% for the LIMEstone virus to 19% for the polyomavirus. After treatment, standard deviations ranged from 3% for the coronavirus to 24% of the circovirus. As a result of a low viral copy number after centrifugation and filtration, a slightly higher standard deviation was observed for mimivirus (38%). Overall, the standard deviation was comparably low before and after the procedure (Fig. S1 and Table S5).",

No or limited homogenisation might be needed for cell culture supernatants, water or blood/serum samples. Faeces, respiratory or soil samples may benefit from a proper homogenisation, whereas tissue samples cannot proceed without a thorough homogenisation for virus release, often using beads of varying sizes. In this study we evaluated the effect of several homogenisation conditions on our artificial communities. Homogenisation with 2.8 mm beads resulted in severe loss of coronavirus and mimivirus, and particularly in a strong increase of bacteria and bacterial rRNA. Since the nucleic acids extraction kit used in this study was not optimised to extract bacterial DNA, extraction efficiency might be enhanced when homogenising with 2.8 mm beads by severely impairing bacterial cell walls. For any virome study this seems to be highly undesirable and should therefore be avoided. If unavoidable, viral losses have to be considered when interpreting the obtained results. The same effect was not observed when 0.1 mm beads were used, suggesting that a bigger mechanical force is necessary to increase extraction efficiency. Overall, the smallest effects on viral losses were observed using the lowest homogenisation speed without beads. In our experience, a proper homogenisation without beads is sufficient to destroy faecal aggregates and obtain a workable suspension.",

Interestingly, centrifugation at 17000 g also resulted in a decrease around 99% in rRNA despite the fact that ribosomes have a size (20\u201330 nm) similar to those of many other viruses in our mock-virome (Table 1). However, the higher density of ribosomes (more than 1.6 g/cm2\n30) in comparison to viral particles may have led to their more efficient precipitation (Table 1).

Our results showed that the majority (>99.5%) of bacteria in our mock-community were efficiently removed using filtration. Only the 0.8-\u03bcm PC filter had a relatively low filter efficiency (from 50% to 99.2%). Unfortunately, filters efficiently removing bacteria also removed more than 99% of mimivirus (Fig. 4A). Not unexpectedly, more than 90% of the herpesviruses were lost with the 0.22-\u03bcm filter, alongside unexpected losses of several smaller viruses. Free floating ribosomes (20\u201330 nm) were not efficiently removed by filtration regardless of the pore size. Our findings suggest that besides the pore size, also the filter material highly influences filter efficiency. This was prominently observed between 0.8-\u03bcm PC and PES filters. Polycarbonate filters have pores precisely cylindrical and narrowly distributed across a thin polycarbonate sheet, whereas the centrifugal PES filter is a 3D polymer network, resulting in much higher filtering efficiency for bacteria and mimivirus (Fig. 4). A limitation of our study is that no representatives of very small bacteria were included, however a great majority of small bacteria are obligate intracellular (e.g. Chlamydiales, Mycoplasmatales) and therefore removed together with their host during centrifugation and filtration.",

Although 17 amplification cycles are recommended by the manufacturer for transcriptome amplification, our findings indicate that all viruses could be amplified, independently of the number of cycles. However, the amplification efficiency differed between viruses, which could not be unambiguously explained by genome type (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA, dsRNA), length or composition (linear, circular, segmented). In previous reports it was shown that multiple displacement amplification preferentially amplified (single-stranded) circular genomes, which was not observed in this study using WTA23233.

The aberrant behaviour of the parvovirus remains unexplained, but is unlikely to be an experimental error as good correlations between qPCR assays and NGS reads were obtained for the remaining viruses. Overall, this suggests that no additional strong bias are introduced after amplification.

CsCl ultracentrifugation poses difficulties with respect to reproducibility and automation, as discussed by Kleiner and colleagues21, and therefore was not investigated in this study. In addition, some viral families and genera are known to be unstable in CsCl, such as the Guttaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Nanovirus31. Furthermore a more recent study reported a strong loss of specific phages (\u03d5VPE25 and T7) tested when using a CsCl method21. For samples with high volume and low viral load (e.g. ocean waters, urine), an additional concentration step may be required. Approaches using FeCl3 or PEG precipitation have been shown very useful363738. The quantitative effect of these procedures on each member of the viral community has not been studied. However, the use of a pre-filtration step with 0.2-\u03bcm, as often used for these methods, will lead to the removal of larger viruses (Fig. 4), which could be overcome by using a 0.8-\u03bcm filter instead.",

These viruses were selected as representatives of a very wide range of physical virus characteristics, such as a distinct virus architecture (spherical, rod-shaped, head-tail structure), different virion sizes (ranging from 17 nm to 700 nm), presence or absence of an envelope, different genome lengths (ranging from 1.8 kb to 1180 kb) different genome types (dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, ssRNA) and different genome compositions (linear, circular, segmented). The largest amount of the above diversity has been observed for eukaryotic viruses, explaining why only a single bacteriophage was included in our mock virome. Moreover, no (-)ssRNA virus was included as there is no reason to expect a different behaviour than any other ssRNA virus in any step of our procedure. We believe that the morphological and physicochemical properties of all know bacteriophages are covered by the nine viruses selected. Porcine circovirus 2, feline panleukopenia virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus and bovine herpesvirus were kindly provided by Sebastiaan Theuns and Hans Nauwynck (University of Ghent).
