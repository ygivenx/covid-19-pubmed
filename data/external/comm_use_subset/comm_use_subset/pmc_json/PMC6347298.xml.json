Viral fusion is initiated upon interactions between virus surface glycoproteins and cellular receptor(s) and/or upon the reduction in pH that follows endocytosis (reviewed in [1\u20133]). The extensive conformational changes that ensue in the viral glycoproteins promote fusion between viral and cellular membranes [4\u20136]. There is strong evidence that viral fusion\u2014and membrane fusion in general\u2014proceeds through a hemifusion intermediate defined as a merger of two contacting membrane leaflets without additional merger of distal leaflets that results in the formation of a fusion pore [6\u20138]. Accordingly, hemifusion is manifested as lipid mixing between viral and host membranes without viral content release, while full membrane fusion entails mixing of distinct aqueous contents delimited by the two membranes [4\u20136]. It has been demonstrated that sub-optimal conditions for membrane fusion including low density of viral glycoproteins, reduced temperature, and\u2014where applicable\u2014insufficiently acidic pH, favor dead-end hemifusion that does not progress to full fusion [9\u201312]. Thus, the progression to full viral fusion that culminates in the release of nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm is largely dependent on local conditions.",

            "text": "The viral envelope glycoproteins responsible for mediating membrane fusion are targets for neutralizing antibodies and virus entry inhibitors. In addition, new innate restriction factors inhibiting virus fusion have been discovered in recent years [13\u201315]. Among these factors is the family of small interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) that exhibits broad-range of antiviral activity [15\u201317]. This family includes IFITM1, which localizes predominantly at the plasma membrane, as well as IFITM2 and IFITM3, which contain an endocytic signal in their cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and thus localize to late endosomal and lysosomal membranes [18\u201321]. IFITMs effectively block entry of many unrelated enveloped viruses, including orthomyxoviruses (influenza A virus, IAV), paramyxoviruses (Respiratory Syncytial Virus, RSV), flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile), filoviruses (Marburg, Ebola), and coronaviruses (SARS) [15\u201317, 20, 22\u201325]. IFITM3 alone is responsible for the bulk of antiviral effects of interferon in cell culture [15]. Importantly, mice lacking the ifitm3 gene more readily succumb to IAV and RSV infection than control mice [26, 27]. There are, however, viruses that are resistant to IFITM-mediated restriction. Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV), Old and New World arenaviruses (Lassa Virus and Junin Virus, respectively), as well as several enveloped DNA viruses, are not affected by IFITMs [15, 28, 29].",

            "text": "The mechanism by which IFITMs inhibit fusion of most viruses, while sparing others, is not understood. We and others have shown that IFITM expression does not elevate the overall endosomal pH [15\u201319, 22, 30, 31] and, thus, should not block acid-triggered refolding of viral fusion proteins that initiate membrane fusion. Clues regarding the antiviral mechanisms of IFITMs come from their subcellular distribution which tend to correlate with IFITM\u2019s potency against different viruses. IFITM2 and -3 better restrict viruses entering from late endosomes, while IFITM1 tends to be more effective against viruses that are thought to fuse with the plasma membrane or with early endosomes (reviewed in [17]). Indeed, expression of an IFITM3 mutant that redistributes the late endosome/lysosome-resident protein to the cell surface abolishes antiviral activity against IAV [32]. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. The fact that IFITM1 outperforms IFITM3 in restricting EBOV fusion [25] highlights the importance of cellular trafficking, as opposed to the steady state distribution, for antiviral activity. Also, a relatively weak IAV restriction exhibited by an IFITM1 chimera containing the N-terminal domain of IFITM3 that localizes to late endosomes suggests a role for other factors in addition to appropriate subcellular localization [21].",

            "text": "The most popular view of the mechanism of IFITM\u2019s antiviral activity is that these proteins create \u201ctough membranes\u201d that are not conducive to fusion [17, 18, 22]. Two principal models for membrane stiffening by IFITMs have been proposed\u2013a direct effect on the membrane in the immediate proximity of these proteins [19, 25, 33\u201335] that could involve changing the membrane fluidity and/or curvature [22, 33, 35], and an indirect effect through altering the lipid composition of endosomes [18]. Several lines of evidence support the proximity-based antiviral activity of IFITMs. First, as discussed above, there is a general correlation between the subcellular localization of IFITMs and their potency against viruses entering from distinct cellular compartments (reviewed in [17]). Second, IFITM3-mediated restriction, but not restriction by the plasma membrane-resident IFITM1, can be bypassed by forcing virus fusion with the plasma membrane [25, 30]. Third, IFITM incorporation into the viral membrane effectively inhibits fusion/infectivity [34, 36\u201338]. On the other hand, IFITM3 has been reported to bind to and inhibit the function of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA) [18], the master regulator of endosome-ER lipid transport. While this model has been disputed by several groups [30, 35], a recent study provided evidence for the antiviral effect of cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/lysosomes and confirmed accumulation of cholesterol in these compartments upon IFITM3 expression [39]. It thus remains unclear whether IFITMs must be present at the sites of virus fusion to block virus entry or affect fusion indirectly, by dysregulating lipid transport or metabolism.",

However, the inability to directly visualize IFITM3 in the context of virus entry into live cells precluded us from assessing whether this factor blocks fusion through a proximity-based mechanism. Here, we overcame this limitation by constructing a functional fluorescent IFITM3 protein and imaging virus co-trafficking and fusion with endosomal compartments in cells expressing this protein. Comparison of entry and fusion of IFITM3-sensitive (IAV) and\u2013resistant (LASV) viruses by 3-color live cell imaging revealed that IAV enters into and remains trapped within endosomes enriched in fluorescent IFITM3, where viruses underwent hemifusion but failed to complete the fusion reaction. In contrast, LASV particles entered and fused with endosomes devoid of IFITM3, implying that LASV escapes restriction by utilizing an endocytic pathway distinct from that employed by IAV. Collectively, our results provide strong support to a proximity model by which presence of IFITM3 at the preferred sites of virus entry restricts viral fusion.",

Linear N- or C-terminal fusions of EGFP (or similar fluorophores) with IFITMs render IFITMs nonfunctional. However, we found that the coding sequence of EGFP inserted into the N-terminal region of IFITM3, predicted to reside in the cytoplasm [40\u201342], generates a functional protein (Fig 1). First, to verify correct subcellular distribution of the fluorescent construct, we co-expressed IFITM3-iEGFP (iEGFP stands for \u201cinternal\u201d EGFP) with an N-terminally myc-tagged IFITM3 in HeLa cells and confirmed their colocalization by fixing and immunostaining the cells (Fig 1B). Extensive colocalization between IFITM3-iEGFP and myc-IFITM3 suggests that subcellular localization of IFITM3 is not perturbed by incorporation of an EGFP tag. To test the functionality of the fluorescent construct, control A549 cells transduced with an empty vector (Vector) and cells transduced with IFITM3-iEGFP were infected with varied doses of influenza A/WSN/33 virus and the resulting infection measured by immunostaining cells for HA antigen. A549 cells were selected because they express very low endogenous levels of IFITM3 [15, 30, 31]. Cells expressing the EGFP-labeled IFITM3 were consistently much more resistant to influenza infection than control cells (Fig 1C). Microscopic analysis revealed that cells expressing intermediate to high levels of IFITM3-iEGFP did not stain for HA antigen (Fig 1D), demonstrating that IFITM3-iEGFP protects cells from IAV infection, similar to unlabeled IFITM3 [15, 30].",

A549 cells transduced with an empty vector, unlabeled IFITM3, IFITM3-imNG, or IFITM3-imTFP1 were inoculated with IAVpp, and the extent of viral fusion was measured after 2 h at 37\u00b0C based on the resulting cytosolic BlaM activity [43, 44]. Compared to the Vector control, IFITM3 severely restricts IAVpp fusion, as shown previously [30]. IFITM3-imNG and IFITM3-imTFP1 proteins were expressed in A549 cells at levels comparable to that of untagged IFITM3, as determined by Western blot analysis of respective cell lysates (Fig 1F), and also potently inhibited IAVpp fusion (Fig 1E). Comparable expression of the two fluorescent constructs is further supported by live cell fluorescence microscopy analysis (S1 Fig). Taken together, our results demonstrate both the appropriate subcellular localization and antiviral activity of fluorescently labeled IFITM3 constructs.",

We have previously shown that IFITM3 expression does not inhibit lipid mixing (hemifusion) between IAV and host endosomal membranes, but rather interferes with the formation of fusion pores [30]. The ability to visualize the distribution of functional fluorescent IFITM3 in living cells enables spatiotemporal analysis of viral fusion restriction. To test lipid mixing activity in the context of endosomes containing fluorescent IFITM3, we co-labeled infectious IAV (A/PR/8/34 H1N1) with a self-quenching concentration of the lipophilic dye SP-DiI18 and with the amine-reactive far-red Alexa Fluor647 dye (AF647) that labels surface glycoproteins of the virus [30]. As shown in the schematic diagram, single-virus hemifusion with an endosome can be detected by the appearance of bright SP-DiI18 spots resulting from dilution of this dye within an endosomal membrane (Fig 2A). Double-labeled IAV were incubated with cells at 4\u00b0C for 20 min, followed by the addition of pre-warmed Live Cell Imaging Buffer (LCIB), and imaging continued at 37\u00b0C. Representative snapshots from the time-lapse movie illustrate the single IAV SP-DiI18 (colored green) dequenching event around 25 min post-infection of Vector cells, indicating redistribution of the dye into an endosomal membrane (Fig 2B, S1 Movie). Fluorescent traces obtained by single IAV tracking show an increase in SP-DiI18 intensity over time, whereas the reference AF647 signal (red) remains relatively constant (Fig 2C). From these traces, the time required for complete dequenching (\u0394t) and the extent of dequenching (ratio of the initial and final mean intensities If/Ii) can be determined (Fig 2C).",

As expected, fluorescent IFITM3 primarily localized to endosomes that exhibited retrograde and anterograde movement in living cells. The dynamics of IFITM3-imTFP1 intracellular transport is illustrated by S2 Movie. Snapshots of a single IAV show the hemifusion event that occurs within an IFITM3-imNG endosome (IFITM3), with the onset of SP-DiI18 dequenching detected at around 32 min (Fig 2E, S3 Movie). The overall kinetics of onset of lipid mixing was not affected by IFITM3 expression (S2A Fig). Fluorescence traces with levels of fluorescence intensity from IFITM3 (blue), SP-Dil18 (green), and AF647 (red) are shown with the time to SP-DiI dequenching (\u0394t) and dequenching ratio of the final and initial mean intensities (Fig 2F).

The fold of SP-DiI18 dequenching was measured by calculating mean ratios of single IAV SP-DiI18 signals after and before dequenching (If/Ii) in A549 Vector cells and in A549-IFITM3-imNG cells occurring within IFITM3+ punctae (as in Fig 2F). The extent of SP-DiI18 dequenching was independent of virus colocalization with IFITM3-imNG endosomes at the time of lipid mixing (Fig 2G). Since the extent of dequenching of lipophilic dyes is proportional to their fold-dilution (e.g., [47, 48]), this result indicates that the average size of recipient endosomes is the same in control and IFITM3-expressing cells. However, the SP-DiI18 dequenching time (\u0394t) was significantly longer in IFITM3+ endosomes compared to Vector cells (Fig 2H), consistent with a hemifusion connection that is more restrictive for lipid diffusion in IFITM3+ endosomes compared to control cells. The slower redistribution of SP-DiI18 to endosomes enriched in IFITM3-imTFP1 is consistent with our previous conclusion that these events represent IAV hemifusion but not full fusion [30]. Indeed, lipid diffusion through both leaflets of a fusion pore is expected to be faster than diffusion through contacting leaflets of a hemifusion intermediate [49]. In another example, IAV SP-DiI18 dequenching can also occur with a bi-phasic increase in intensity, suggesting either transient fusion pore closure or representing the transition from a restrictive hemifusion structure that attenuates lipid diffusion to a fusion pore (S2 Fig).",

Virus fusion is detected based upon the release of mCherry into the cytoplasm through a fusion pore, while the YFP-Vpr marker remains in the viral core (Fig 3A). Labeled IAVpp were bound to A549 Vector cells in the cold by spinoculation (see Methods). Virus fusion was synchronously initiated by adding pre-warmed LCIB and visualized by two-color live cell microscopy for 2 hours with mCherry and YFP signals acquired every 6 seconds. Single IAVpp entered and fused with A549 cells, in agreement with our published data [30]. Time series images show the initial trafficking of a representative mCherry/YFP-Vpr labeled virus until fusion occurs, as evidenced by the loss of mCherry fluorescence, while the YFP-Vpr signal remains relatively constant (Fig 3B and 3C, S4 Movie).",

To test this hypothesis, we synchronized IAVpp entry into A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells, as described above, and monitored mCherry/YFP-Vpr-labeled viral particles using three-color live cell imaging. Time series images show the IAVpp entering the IFITM3+ compartment and co-trafficking without undergoing fusion (Fig 3D). The fluorescence traces obtained by single virus tracking confirm entry (indicated by the red arrow) into an IFITM3+ endosome. At a later time, the virus-carrying endosome encounters and merges with another IFITM3+ compartment, as indicated by the second red arrow around 36 min (Fig 3E, S5 Movie). This pseudovirus did not fuse (release mCherry) for as long as the time-lapse imaging was performed. Co-trafficking of IAVpp with an IFITM3+ compartment can be visualized by examining 3D trajectories of the virus and relevant endosomes, which shows IAVpp co-trafficking with the first and then the second endosomal compartments containing IFITM3-imTFP1 (Fig 3F). Importantly, analysis of 6309 particles did not reveal a single viral fusion event occurring after extensive IAVpp co-trafficking with an IFITM3+ compartment.",

The viral particle appears to transiently colocalize with an IFITM3+ endosome when visualized in 2D, but particle tracking performed in 3D shows that the viral particle and the IFITM3+ endosome traffic in different Z-planes. These observations suggest that a transient and chance encounter of a virus carrying endosome with an IFITM3+ endosome is not sufficient to restrict fusion. In contrast, fusion is blocked after sustained and prolonged IAVpp co-trafficking with an IFITM3+ endosome, which strongly implies that the virus is being carried by an IFITM3-enriched compartment.",

Our results thus demonstrate, for the first time, that the presence of IFITM3 in the endosomes carrying the virus is key to restriction of IAV fusion. The unimpeded lipid mixing between IAV and IFITM3+ endosomes, together with the lack of viral content release, strongly imply that IFITM3 traps the IAV fusion at a hemifusion stage by blocking the formation of a small fusion pore (in agreement with our previous study [30]).",

The overall acidity of IFITM3+ endosomes was assessed by loading A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells with the acidic compartment marker, LysoTracker Red (S4 Fig). Imaging of fixed cells shows strong cytoplasmic colocalization between IFITM3+ endosomes and LysoTracker Red positive compartments, with only a small fraction of peripheral IFITM3+ endosomes lacking a detectable LysoTracker Red signal (S4A Fig, Inset). Analysis of multiple fields of view confirms that most IFITM3+ endosomes, with the exception of a small number of peripheral endosomes, accumulate the lysosomal marker (S4B Fig). This finding is consistent with progressive acidification of early IFITM3-containing endosomes through a maturation process and thus supports the notion that virus-carrying late IFITM3+ endosomes are acidic.",

A549-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells were infected with IAVpp labeled with mCherry-2xCL-YFP-Vpr, as above, in the presence of 1 \u03bcM AmphoB. As seen with a bulk fusion assay (Fig 4A), single IAVpp fuses with IFITM3+ endosomes in the presence of AmphoB. Representative single virus images show the entry and subsequent co-trafficking of an IAV particle with an IFITM3+ compartment and fusion within the compartment, as indicated by the sudden loss of mCherry (Fig 4B and 4C, S8 Movie). Of the 23 total fusion events that occur in IFITM3-imTFP1 cells treated with AmphoB, 7 particles co-traffic and fuse with IFITM3+ compartments (Fig 4G). In contrast to IFITM3-imTFP1 expressing cells in the presence of AmphoB, IAVpp exclusively fused at sites devoid of the mutant IFITM3 in 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 cells (Fig 4D and 4E, S9 Movie). None of the IAVpp fusion events of the total 4442 particles annotated in 2M-IFITM3 cells co-traffic with IFITM3+ compartments. Fig 4D and 4E illustrates this phenomenon, whereby an IAVpp particle fuses within a 2M-IFITM3-imTFP1 cell but does not co-traffic with appreciable local 2M-imTFP1 maxima. These results suggest that loss of antiviral activity of the F75/78A IFITM3 mutant may be due to its altered subcellular distribution that prevents co-trafficking with IAV. This is in contrast to AmphoB, which renders wild-type IFITM3-imTFP1 inactive without affecting its trafficking pathways. Of note, both conditions that rescued the IAVpp fusion delayed the fusion kinetics relative to untreated cells expressing IFITM3-imTFP1 (S5 Fig), indicating a global effect on the rate of virus endocytosis and entry into permissive compartments. Together, the above results support the notion that IFITM3 inhibits IAV fusion through a proximity-based mechanism\u2013by co-trafficking with the virus and accumulating in compartments that are otherwise permissive for IAV fusion.",

LASVpp imaging in A549 cells confirmed the ability to track single particles and detect their fusion (release of mCherry) in late endosomal compartments (Fig 5B, S10 Movie). Interestingly, LASVpp fusion exhibited a unique feature rarely seen for other viruses, including IAV. The YFP-Vpr fluorescence, which is markedly decreased at mildly acidic pH [51, 52], was consistently quenched at some point prior to viral fusion, demonstrating acidification of intraviral pH [53, 54] (schematized in Fig 5A). Single frame images show that YFP-Vpr signal quenched for ~10 min before viral fusion, which is observed as the loss of mCherry signal (red) and concomitant reappearance of the YFP-Vpr signal (Fig 5B and 5C, arrow). The dequenching of YFP fluorescence can be attributed to the re-neutralization of the virus\u2019 interior through a fusion pore connecting it to the cytoplasm [52, 54, 55]. Based on the differences in IAVpp and LASVpp fusion, we classified single virus fusion events into \u201cType I\u201d, in which mCherry signal is lost without acidification of the virus interior (YFP quenching), as observed in IAV fusion, and \u201cType II\u201d events, in which acidification of the virus interior occurs prior to fusion (mCherry release), as observed in LASV fusion. In A549 cells, only 9% of LASVpp fusion events are Type I, while most particles\u201491%\u2014undergo Type II fusion (Fig 5D). Of note, YFP-Vpr quenching occurs for most particles not undergoing fusion at later times after infection due to a non-specific acidification of the viral interior in late acidic compartments. These events representing a non-productive entry of LASVpp were excluded from analysis.",

The average lag time between YFP-Vpr quenching and fusion for LASVpp in A549 cells is 14.1 minutes (Fig 5F, inset). To test if the observed lag was due to the requirement for further virus trafficking to fusion-permissive compartments, we asked if it depended on how long a virus trafficked prior to YFP-quenching (Fig 5G). The lag between quenching and fusion does not appear to be correlated with the waiting time for quenching (R2 = 0.0263), suggesting that LASVpp fusion following the YFP quenching is a stochastic event that does not depend on the virus trafficking history. Although acidification of the virus interior does not directly report the time of acidification of endosomal lumen, the above results demonstrate that LASV GPc retains fusion-competence under acidic conditions for a considerable time before it fuses with permissive late endosomes, perhaps after binding to LAMP1 [57, 58].",

This unique event is atypical of the majority of tracked particles due to several reasons: (1) there is an apparent colocalization with IFITM3+ beginning at time 0; and (2) LASVpp rarely fuse as early as 14 min post-infection. Most importantly, the fusion event in Fig 6E and 6F appears to represent transient fusion pore opening, as indicated by the sudden re-quenching of YFP, or re-acidification of the virus interior following pore closure (Fig 6E\u20136G). We report this instance to illustrate that, while LASVpp typically avoids IFITM3+ endosomes, miniscule levels of fusion may occur within IFITM3+ compartments. Overall, LASVpp exhibit a strong tendency to bypass IFITM3+ endosomes and this important feature likely represents the mechanism by which this virus escapes restriction.",

To test this notion, we followed the bulk virus uptake and transport in live A549 cells expressing IFITM3-imNG. Cells were incubated in the cold for 1.5 hr with IAVpp or LASVpp labeled with an internal fluorescent marker, Gag-mCherry, to allow virus binding. Cells were then incubated for indicated times (0, 15, 30, and 60 min) at 37\u00b0C, fixed and imaged at high spatial resolution. Representative images of IAVpp and LASVpp co-localization with IFITM3 containing vesicles at different time points are shown in Fig 7A. Quantification of virus colocalization with IFITM3-imNG over time shows that IAVpp increasingly co-localizes with IFITM3-imNG compartments, while LASVpp does not show a significant increase in colocalization up to 1 hr post-infection (Fig 7B). These data support the hypothesis that restriction-sensitive viruses (as is the case for IAV) co-traffic with IFITM3, while resistant viruses (like LASV) are transported through distinct endosomal compartments devoid of this restriction factor.",

Compared to the control IAVpp, fusion of IAVpp containing IFITM3 was potently inhibited (p<0.001, Fig 8B). Interestingly, AmphoB rescued IAVpp/IFITM3 fusion (Fig 8B), suggesting a direct effect of this antibiotic on IFITM3 or the viral membrane that is independent of cellular processes, including endocytic transport. The diminished ability of IAVpp produced in the presence of IFITM3 to fuse with target cells was not caused by IFITM3-containing extracellular vesicles present in the viral preparations, as have been suggested in [59]. Viral fusion was not significantly diminished when A549 cells were infected with a mixture of control IAVpp and extracellular medium from cells transfected only with an IFITM3-expressing plasmid (S7A Fig). Although IFITM3-containig extracellular vesicles were effectively concentrated by our virus concentration protocol using LentiX (S7B Fig), these vesicles did not modulate the fusion activity of IAVpp under our experimental conditions involving a brief exposure of target cells to the virus and vesicles. Taken together, these results suggest that the presence of IFITM3 is necessary and sufficient to restrict IAV fusion, irrespective of whether or not IFITM3 is expressed in the target or viral membrane.",

In this model, cell fusion is triggered by exposure to low pH, which bypasses the need for endocytic trafficking that may sort LASVpp away from IFITM3+ compartments. Cos7 cells transiently expressing LASV GPc were brought in contact with 293T cells stably expressing IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 [22] or, in control experiments, with parental 293T cells. Cos7 and 293T cells were pre-loaded with different cytosolic fluorescent dyes to monitor fusion initiated by an acidic buffer, as previously described [22]. In stark contrast to LASVpp fusion with IFITM3-expressing cells (Fig 6), GPc-mediated cell-cell fusion was markedly inhibited by all three IFTIMs expressed in target cells (Fig 8C). This result supports the notion that LASV GPc is not inherently resistant to IFITM restriction and that the reason LASV is insensitive to IFITM3 expression is through its usage of trafficking pathways that are distinct from those used by IFITM3.",

Imaging experiments demonstrate that IAV restriction involves virus co-trafficking with IFITM3-containing endosomes that can culminate in lipid mixing (hemifusion) but does not progress to complete fusion (viral content release). This important finding, along with our previous work [17, 30, 35], strongly supports a proximity model for virus restriction, as opposed to alternative models that involve, for example, dysregulation of cholesterol transport from late endosomes [18, 39]. Also importantly, we documented the \u201cavoidance\u201d mechanism of LASVpp escape from IFITM3 restriction through virus trafficking and fusion with endosomes lacking this restriction factor. Consistently, LASV GPc-mediated cell-cell fusion is sensitive to IFITM proteins expressed on the surface of target cells. These results highlight the importance of regulation of IFITM trafficking for antiviral activity and offer important clues regarding the determinants of virus resistance to restriction. Of note, the presence of IFITM3 at the sites of IAV fusion does not rule out the possibility that the antiviral effect is due to recruitment of downstream effector proteins, such as ZMPSTE24 [60]. IFITMs have the propensity to hetero-oligomerize [21] and interact with a number of other proteins [61], so it is possible that IFITM-driven protein complexes alter the membrane properties and disfavor viral fusion (see below).",

Due to the relatively high and variable background fluorescence in cells expressing fluorescent IFITM3, it is difficult to quantitatively assess whether there is a threshold density of this protein below which viruses are not restricted. In other words, it is unclear whether inhibition of IAV fusion by IFITM3 occurs through an all-or-none mechanism or there is an inhibition \u201cgradient\u201d whereby the probability of fusion is inversely proportional to the IFITM3 signal. Future studies using improved fluorescence labeling techniques and controlled IFITM3 expression levels will help distinguish between these modes of action. The existence of distinct domains within the highly dynamic endosomal membranes (e.g., [62\u201366]) adds an additional layer of complexity when interpreting the IFITM3 restriction results. It is possible that the extremely rare single LASVpp fusion events that appear to colocalize with IFITM3 occur with IFITM3-free domains within the limiting membrane of an endosome.",

Analyses of lipid dye dequenching, irrespective of colocalization with IFITM3, did not reveal significant differences in the rate or extent of lipid mixing. This finding is in disagreement with the reduced IAV lipid dequenching in IFITM3-expressing cells reported in [39]. The reason for discrepant results is likely related to the use of a bulk lipid dequenching assay in [39], as compared to the real-time single IAV tracking in our experiments. Importantly, in the present study, we were able to show the markedly slower rate of lipid redistribution to IFITM3-containing endosomes by focusing on events occurring in these compartments compared to lipid mixing in control cells. It should be noted that, in spite of exogenous incorporation of DiI into the viral membrane in the commonly used labeling protocol (e.g., [30, 67]), the dye readily redistributes to both membrane leaflets, as we have demonstrated previously [68]. Thus, a slower lipid mixing between IAV and IFITM3-positive endosomes is consistent with a more restricted dye diffusion through the merged contacting leaflets of hemifused membranes, as compared to diffusion through both leaflets of a fusion pore.",

            "text": "The exact mechanism by which IFITM3 inhibits the transition from hemifusion to fusion is not clear. A large body of work demonstrates a critical role of lipid composition, and specifically of mechanical properties of lipid membranes, in protein-mediated membrane fusion (reviewed in [69]). Bending energies of highly curved lipid intermediates that form and resolve during merger of lipid bilayers are key determinants of the fusion process (reviewed in [69\u201371]). In addition, hemifusion and the formation of a fusion pore within a hemifusion diaphragm are associated with changes in areas of contacting and distal monolayers, respectively. Thus, viral fusion pore opening could be blocked by: (1) increased membrane bending modulus; (2) increased negative curvature of the cytoplasmic leaflet that disfavors the formation of a net positive curvature fusion pore [69, 72]; (3) expansion of the hemifusion diaphragm to a size beyond that permissible for fusion pore formation [73]; or (4) reduced \u201cfluidity\u201d (lateral diffusion) of the cytoplasmic leaflet, which can be caused by IFITM homo/hetero-oligomerization [21]. The latter effect is expected to disfavor the fusion pore opening due to inability to quickly remove excess lipid from the hemifusion site. IFITMs have been reported to alter membrane fluidity [21, 35], and to increase the lipid order and confer positive spontaneous curvature [22, 33]. It is thus possible that individual effects of IFITMs on lipid membranes or their combination are responsible for the fusion block. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that mutations in distinct regions of IFITM3 regulate its inhibitory vs enhancing activity against infection by different coronaviruses [74]. The ability to switch between inhibition and promotion of coronavirus fusion by introducing point mutations in IFITM3 further supports the proximity-based mechanism of virus restriction.",

According to this model, viruses are redirected into multivesicular endosomes where unrestricted fusion with intraluminal vesicles, as opposed to fusion with the limiting membrane of an endosome, does not allow viral capsid release into the cytoplasm. The single virus content (mCherry) release assay would not detect IAVpp fusion with intraluminal vesicles, as the content marker will remain contained within the same endosome. The similar extent of lipid dye dequenching upon single IAV fusion with control and IFITM3-positive endosomes (Fig 2) appears compatible with virus hemifusion to the limiting membrane, but the slower dequenching rate in IFITM3 compartments could be due to multiple rounds of hemifusion with intraluminal vesicles.

In fact, IFITMs appear to more potently inhibit HIV-1 infection when incorporated into virions, as compared to their expression in target cells [38]. It is tempting to assume that the same mechanism of the IFITMs\u2019 antiviral activity is functional in both cellular and viral membranes, but this notion has not been explicitly tested. The ability of IFITM3 to inhibit IAV fusion irrespective of whether it is expressed in the target or viral membrane (Fig 8B) supports the universal mechanism of IFITM3-mediated restriction that involves altering the properties of lipid membranes, as opposed to interacting with viral or cellular proteins. Our finding that AmphoB rescues the fusion-competence of IAVpp containing IFITM3, similar to its antagonistic effect on the cell-expressed IFITM3 [35], is also consistent with the common mechanism of virus restriction. Moreover, the static nature of the viral membrane, which is in stark contrast to the highly dynamic cell membranes, supports a direct effect of AmphoB on the viral membrane, perhaps through alterations of membrane fluidity [22, 35]. Thus, virions containing IFITMs in their membranes could provide a tractable model for mechanistic studies of these proteins.",

We thus speculate that all members of the IFITM family accumulate at the sites of fusion of sensitive viruses and block the formation of a fusion pore.

Stable cell lines expressing fluorescently-tagged IFITM3 used for imaging analysis were obtained by transducing with VSV-G pseudotyped viruses encoding wild-type or the 2M mutant (F75/78A) IFITM3 [21] or with the Vector pQCXIN (Clontech) and selecting with 1 mg/ml G418. Following selection, cells were maintained in 0.5 mg/ml G418. Stable cell lines expressing unlabeled and fluorescently-tagged IFITM3 used for bulk fusion assays were obtained by transducing with VSV-G pseudotyped viruses encoding wild-type IFITM3 with the Vector pQXCIP (Clontech) and selecting with 1.5 \u03bcg/ml puromycin.",

An EGFP cassette flanked by two linkers was created by PCR (forward primer TCAAGGAGGAGCACGAGGTGGCTGTGCTGGGGGCGCCCCACAACCCTGCTCCCGGCGGAGGAAGCGGCGGAGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGC; reverse primer GACGACATGGTCGGGCACGGAGGTCTCGCTGCGGATGTGGATCACGGTGGATCCGCCTCCGCTTCCGCCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCC) and inserted using Gibson assembly into KasI/BsaBI-cut IFITM3 cDNA. The resulting protein has amino acids 41 (P) and 42 (T) of wild-type IFITM3 removed. The cloning of IFITM3-imNeonGreen (IFITM3-imNG), and IFITM3-imTFP1 (IFITM3-imTFP1) into pQCXIN (Clontech) and pQXCIP (Clontech) retroviral expression vectors were done in two steps. In the first step, the EGFP in IFITM3-iEGFP/pLVX Tet on construct was replaced either with mNeonGreen or mTFP1 by overlapping PCR. The IFITM3-iEGFP/pLVX Tet on construct contain an EcoRI restriction site in the 5\u2019 of the IFITM3-iEGFP cDNA and a BsrgGI in the 3\u2019 of GFP cDNA that facilitated the replacement of GFP.

With three-color imaging to track double-labeled viral particles that co-traffic with fluorescently-labeled IFITM3 compartments, single Z-planes in which the viral particle trafficked were used so that background subtraction could be performed using the ICY spot tracking algorithm. The local background was determined by dilating the identified objects corresponding to viral particles by two pixels. The difference between the integrated intensities of the particle and the dilated surrounding gave the intensity surrounding the particle, from which an average per pixel local background was calculated.
