            "text": "Outbreaks of emerging viruses occur with worrying regularity, and while some are quickly controlled locally, others become public health events of global concern. Among the pathogens involved, viruses that can be transmitted directly and cause severe disease with high mortality such as filovirus and henipavirus are considered World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens. Until the recent West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic, which resulted in 28,616 confirmed cases and 11,310 deaths,1,2 EBOV outbreaks were generally small and rapidly contained.3,4 The same holds true for Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses, which so far have mainly caused local clusters of infection,5,6 or small outbreaks as the one currently ongoing in India.7 However, the first NiV outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u20131999 resulted in 276 documented infections with a case fatality rate of approximately 40%,8,9 illustrating the challenges associated with predicting and preparing for such events. Since licensed therapies or vaccines are often not immediately available, patient isolation, supportive care, and contact tracing are the main approaches used to control these outbreaks.10,11 There is thus a renewed interest in therapeutic approaches such as convalescent sera or hyperimmune sera of animal origin, which can be rapidly available.",

            "text": "Passive antibody treatment with whole blood or plasma from convalescent patients has been used as experimental therapy during filovirus outbreaks since 1967,12,13 with variable results. Whole blood from convalescent donors was given as a post-exposure treatment during the 1995 Kikwit outbreak with seven of eight patients surviving the infection.14 However, post-exposure treatment of nonhuman primates with whole blood from convalescent donors did not replicate the successes seen in human patients.15 More recently, 84 patients treated with convalescent plasma failed to show significant improvement in survival during the 2014 West African outbreak,16 but definitive interpretation of these data is difficult because the antibody titers and virus-neutralizing activity of the convalescent plasma was not reported. Post-exposure prophylaxis studies in EBOV-infected nonhuman primates using high-titer purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from convalescent macaques is fully protective against subsequent challenge,17 indicating that functional antibody titers may be the determining factor. Neutralizing antibodies are also important mediators of protection against NiV.18 Post-exposure passive transfer of sera from hamsters immunized with either vaccinia or vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) expressing the NiV-G protein provides protection from lethal virus challenge in a hamster model,19,20 as do murine monoclonal antibodies that bind either NiV-F or NiV-G,21 and a human monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity against the related Hendra virus G protein in ferrets.22",

Serum was collected 2 weeks after each immunization and kinetics of total and neutralizing antibody responses were followed. First antibodies against EBOV-GP were detected after 2 weeks, with approximately 10-fold higher titers in the Sigma and TiterMax adjuvant groups. The titers in all groups gradually increased over the course of the immunizations, but while the final titers induced by non-adjuvanted EBOV VLPs were similar to those in the Alhydrogel-adjuvanted and TiterMax-adjuvanted groups, Sigma adjuvant resulted in 10-fold higher final titers (Fig. 1c). Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with the recombinant VSV that expresses the GP of the closely related EBOV Zaire strain Kikwit (VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP).34 First neutralizing antibodies were detected after the second immunization, but a robust increase was only observed in the adjuvanted groups, with a 5-fold increase in the TiterMax-adjuvanted and Alhydrogel-adjuvanted groups and a 20-fold increase in the Sigma adjuvant group (Fig. 1d), leading us to choose Sigma adjuvant for all further experiments.",

To determine the importance of this aspect for the induction of functional antibodies, we compared adjuvanted EBOV VLPs with vector vaccines based on the replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA) that expresses either the GP protein of the Zaire EBOV Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou strain alone or in combination with VP40 (unpublished data), and the replication-competent VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP.34 Due to the around 80% amino acid sequence identity and strong structural and functional conservation among Zaire EBOV-GP proteins, the induced immune responses are cross-reactive within the species.35,36 As before, mice were immunized three times in 2-week intervals. Total antibody titers against EBOV-GP increased rapidly after initial immunization in all groups, but in contrast to the adjuvanted EBOV VLPs and the VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP, there was no further increase after the third immunization with the MVA-based viral vectors (Fig. 2a). Neutralizing antibodies were detected in MVA/EBOV-GP-immunized groups after the first and MVA/EBOV-VP40/GP-immunized groups after the second immunization and slightly increased to yield final titers around 10 (Fig. 2b). The first neutralizing antibodies in VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP animals were also detected after the first immunization with final titers reaching 40 (Fig. 2b). Even though the neutralizing antibodies were again only detected after the first boost in the group immunized with adjuvanted EBOV VLPs, titers ultimately reached levels around 100 (Fig. 2b), illustrating that de novo protein expression is not required for efficient induction of functional antibodies.",

The neutralizing antibody titers assessed in VNT with EBOV were for MVA/EBOV-GP rabbit sera more than 10-fold and for VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP and VLP rabbit sera more than 75-fold higher than the average geometric mean neutralizing endpoint titers of 16 (24) or 11 (23.5) in vaccines at day 28 or 180 (Table 2), indicating that titers of the rabbit hyperimmune sera are within the therapeutic range.38 While more systematic bridging studies would be required to directly correlate our in-house with the official diagnostic assays, the similar relative proportions of the titers induced by the different immunization platforms indicates their suitability for initial analyses.",

First, serum proteins were precipitated in a two-step precipitation using 0.864 and 1.728 M ammonium sulfate followed by IgG affinity chromatography using Protein A. Next, IgG was modified by a pepsin digestion to remove the Fc portion to generate F(ab\u2032)2 preparations (Fig. 4a). To accurately compare antibody titers over the course of the purification process, titers are expressed relative to the same volume for all samples. The purification and concentration is illustrated on a Coomassie-stained non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel loaded with the same protein concentration of initial serum, purification intermediates after precipitation, and the IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 preparations (Fig. 4b). After ammonium sulfate precipitation, more than 90%, and even after subsequent IgG affinity purification more than 80% of neutralization activity were recovered (Fig. 4c). Pepsin digest led to around 50% loss of neutralization activity in F(ab\u2032)2 preparations compared to unmodified serum, indicating that the multi-step purification process results in high yield purified IgG preparations with only little loss of functional antibody titers, and F(ab\u2032)2 fragmentation with at least 50% recovery of functional activity.",

Here we explored the potential of generating animal-origin hyperimmune sera in a 2-month time frame using EBOV and NiV as model antigens. We found that adjuvanted VLPs were more effective than MVA-based or VSV-based expression vectors in inducing high-titer functional antibodies after repeated immunizations, reaching levels above the putative protective threshold for the respective pathogen. An optimized purification protocol combining ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by protein A affinity purification yielded concentrated polyclonal IgG with maintained functional activity and in vivo stability, indicating that this approach may be feasible in emergency situations.",

By comparing the replication-competent recombinant VSV and the replication-incompetent MVA vaccine platforms with adjuvanted VLPs, we show that even though de novo antigen expression was associated with an earlier development of total anti-EBOV antibodies, functional titers increased over the course of the immunizations for all candidates, with adjuvanted VLPs resulting in induction of similar final titers as VSV\u0394G/EBOV-GP.
