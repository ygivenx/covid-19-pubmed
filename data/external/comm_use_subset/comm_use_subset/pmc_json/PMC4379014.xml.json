Viral pathogens are the most significant contributors [2].ARI is caused by many viruses, including the following: influenza viruses (IAV, IBV and ICV), respiratory syncytial virus(RSV),rhinovirus(HRV), human parainfluenza viruses(HPIV)1\u20134, human metapneumovirus(HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63,229E,OC43, and HKU1, human enterovirus (HEV) and adenovirus(HADV)[3].The similar clinical presentations of patients infected by various respiratory viruses make etiological diagnoses difficult when physicians simply make decisions based only on physical symptoms. The etiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) has been well characterized in some parts of the world, especially in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere [4\u20137].However, much less is known about the etiology of ILI in China, especially in Southeast China, which is located in a temperate region.",

Shanghai Dongfang Hospital and Shanghai Zhoupu Hospital have been national influenza surveillance sentinel units since 2007. As in other regions of China, ILI data from hospitals can provide valuable information that could be used for monitoring the onset of an epidemic, especially the circulation of influenza virus. However, the epidemiology in Pudong of viral etiology for ILI is poorly understood. With support from the Chinese Key SciTech Program for Infection Control(under The Twelfth Five-year Framework), a laboratory-based influenza-like illness surveillance system was established in 2011 in Pudong New Area. We adapted multiplex RT-PCR assays for the detection of influenza virus and a number of other respiratory viruses that have recently been introduced, and these assays are also more sensitive than culture [8\u201310]. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and etiological characteristics of influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatients in this area from January 2011 through December 2013.",

There is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections, and it is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection.

There are multiple explanations for these differences. The differences could be due to true differences in the overall burden, to differences among study populations, or to detection methods that differed from among studies. It is difficult to compare the results, as the reported data were obtained with different detection methods or PCR primers [21, 25]. Future comparative studies to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these detection methods should clarify this issue. Second, the infection rates may vary with geographical location and with the particular period chosen for testing [25, 26]. Third, the patient population and its environment may influence the results. In our study, up to 1332 specimens were negative in RT-PCR although all of them matched well with the inclusion criteria for ILI. Negative findings could have resulted from the low load of viral material in samples, or to infection with bacteria or other viruses such as enterovirus.",

As in many previous studies [4, 6, 7, 20, 27\u201330], influenza A and B virus were the most commonly detected viral pathogens in outpatients with ILI in our region. An epidemic of influenza virus usually occurs in the winter. However, an epidemic peak of IAV infection was observed in the summer of 2012. More patients with influenza-like illness were observed during this period. This result was consistent with the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) (2012 2013) China flu Weekly Report[31]. In addition, HRV, RSV, HADV, HCoV, HPIV and HMPV were identified from outpatient specimens and contributed collectively to 38.4% of all ILI laboratory-confirmed cases in our study. The detection rate of influenza virus was significantly higher among adult patients, whereas other viruses, such as HADV, HCoV, and HMPV, were prevalent among children less than 15 years of age. These findings are consistent with reports from other studies [5, 32\u201334].",

The positive rate (3.1%) was lower than that found by previous studies, which detected HRV in 10% to >40% of respiratory infections[29, 35]. HRV may circulate year-round in our region, a result found by previous studies [20, 25, 28]. RSV-positive samples occurred at a low level in our study. This finding contrasts with other studies [27, 36], where the predominant virus detected in children less than 5 years of age was RSV. The reason for this difference is that we did not include hospitalized children, as RSV has been shown to be a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital[5, 37, 38]. Previous studies on RSV infections have primarily been conducted in hospitalized elderly adults with medical conditions such as cardiopulmonary diseases[39] that may predispose them to viral infections that are relatively uncommon in the general population.",

However, the subsequent clinical conditions of ILI illness patients were not obtained, and thus the association between co-infections and severe signs cannot be analyzed.
