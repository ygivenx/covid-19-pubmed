Such viruses include influenza A virus (IAV), Ebola virus, rabies virus, SARS virus, MERS virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus and Lassa virus. Many other human pathogenic viruses are RNA viruses, including poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), rubella virus, chikungunya virus, Norwalk virus, mumps virus and measles virus. RNA viruses also include important pathogens of livestock, such as bluetongue virus, foot and mouth disease virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Schmallenberg virus. Further, the majority of plant viruses are RNA viruses. The combined impact of RNA viruses\u2014economically and in terms of human suffering\u2014is immense.",

Many of the most important RNA viruses were amongst the first genomes to be sequenced, some 30 years ago. Surprisingly, however, \u2018hidden\u2019 protein-coding genes are still being discovered even in the most well-studied and economically important RNA viruses including the potyviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, arteriviruses and IAV (1\u20136). Such genes tend to be very short, often overlap other genes (in an alternative reading frame) and are often expressed via non-canonical translational mechanisms. These features make such genes difficult to identify using conventional bioinformatic or experimental approaches. Current knowledge of non-coding functional elements in RNA virus genomes (e.g. essential replicational, translational and packaging signals) is also far from complete. While such elements have been reasonably well mapped in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of genomes of the most important RNA viruses, RNA virus genomes frequently contain additional non-coding functional elements embedded within the protein-coding regions.",

This potential has been realized most thoroughly for the human genome. In contrast, far less work has been done on applying comparative genomic techniques to virus genomes (18). This is surprising because many viruses\u2014particularly RNA viruses\u2014are uniquely amenable to comparative genomic analysis. RNA viruses have very small genomes (2\u201332 kb), and many are of medical or economic importance, both factors which have led to the accumulation of large numbers of sequenced isolates for many species. Furthermore, RNA viruses evolve extremely rapidly so that, even within a single species, different strains often diverge by 10\u201330% at the nucleotide level. By studying the patterns of substitutions in large numbers of sequences from a single virus species, or groups of related virus species, it is often possible to predict novel functional elements and gain considerable insight into their function. Where resources are limited, comparative computational analyses can be used to efficiently target experimental analysis. In contrast with many high-throughput experimental approaches, comparative genomics allows the direct detection of purifying selection which, to a very large extent, is synonymous with functional importance (19).",

A statistically significant reduction in variability at synonymous sites is indicative of an overlapping functional element such as an overlapping gene or functional RNA structure. Previously, we developed a novel algorithm, herein named synplot2, for this analysis (23,24). Unlike most earlier work, synplot2 simultaneously takes into account phylogeny, calculates statistical significance and does not require a training set. Previously, we have tested this technique by experimentally verifying a number of new features discovered using synplot2. These include the +1 frameshift PA-X gene in IAV (6), the -2 frameshift nsp2TF gene in arteriviruses (5), the -1 frameshift NS1\u2019 gene in Japanese encephalitis virus and related flaviviruses (3,23), the -1 frameshift 2B* gene in Encephalomyocarditis virus (25), an extended stem-loop structure that stimulates programmed stop codon readthrough in alphaviruses (24), the 5a gene in arteriviruses (4), the non-AUG initiated Px gene in sobemoviruses (26), an unexpected subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) for capsid protein expression in Solenopsis invicta virus 3 (27) and an essential RNA element in HEV (28).",

We identify a number of potential new overlapping genes and hundreds of other regions with statistically significantly reduced variability at synonymous sites.

Neutral evolution was modelled using a Kimura nucleotide substitution matrix with \u03ba = 3 (29). These stipulations account for the differing probabilities of transitions (purine to purine or pyrimidine to pyrimidine) and transversions (purine to pyrimidine or vice versa), and the fact that synonymous substitutions involving just a single nucleotide change (e.g. CUU to CUG leucine) should be more probable than synonymous substitutions involving additional changes (e.g. CUU to UUG leucine).

First a phylogenetic tree for the alignment was constructed using standard methods. Then the (unrooted) tree was used to select a list of sequence pairs tracing round the outside of an arbitrary two-dimensional representation of the tree (N pairs for N sequences), and synplot2 statistics were calculated and summed just for this set of sequence pairs. Conceptually, such a set of pairwise comparisons covers every branch of the phylogenetic tree exactly twice, so undue weight is not given to some branches over others as would occur for all-against-all pairwise comparisons. It should be noted that the set of sequence pairs used is not unique as there are many possible two-dimensional representations of a large unrooted tree. After summing at each codon position over the phylogenetic tree and dividing by two (to account for covering each branch twice), the statistics were averaged over a sliding window. An approximate P-value (probability that any reduction in synonymous-site variability in the window would be as great as observed if the null model were true) was also calculated, under the assumption of a normal distribution as an approximation to the sum of many independent multinomial distributions.",

Comparative genomic analysis can aid identification of the correct frameshift site as frameshift sites are generally highly conserved between related species. Based on this and the literature, we annotated sites of known or predicted influenza-PAX-like +1 frameshifting in IAV, fijiviruses, Chronic bee paralysis virus and related viruses and amalgamaviruses according to (33). Programmed +1 frameshifting in closterovirids was assumed to involve P-site slippage on the GUU_U of a GUU_stop_C sequence that is highly conserved at the ORF1 stop codon in most closterovirids (31,34). In ampeloviruses (family Closteroviridae) that lack this motif, +1 P-site slippage was assumed to occur on the UUU_C of a slightly upstream UUU_CGA sequence (PAX-like) that is conserved in many other ampelovirus sequences. Finally in Citrus tristeza closterovirus, where ORF1 is extended some 25 codons relative to other closteroviruses, +1 frameshifting was assumed to occur on the GUU_C of a GUU_CGG sequence that aligns to the GUU_stop in other closteroviruses (35). In Leishmania RNA virus 1, +1 frameshifting is assumed but the site remains unknown. However, our comparative analysis using several recently available sequences suggested it may involve +1 P-site slippage on a conserved CCC_GAA sequence. Sites of -2 frameshifting in arteriviruses and Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1, and -1/+2 slippage in potyvirids, were annotated according to (1), (5) and (36).",

Initial multiple sequence alignments (see below) were analyzed with the gene-finding program MLOGD (1,30) to identify unannotated coding ORFs, particularly in regions previously assumed to be non-coding (e.g. non-AUG initiated upstream ORFs). MLOGD was originally developed to predict novel overlapping genes, but, in most cases, we find it to be less sensitive for this purpose than synplot2. However, MLOGD can also be used to annotate non-overlapping or partially overlapping genes. In this usage, MLOGD is conceptually similar to the Ka/Ks statistic (ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions). A small number of additional potential coding ORFs were identified based simply on the presence of a long ORF (statistical significance assessed via sequence shuffling methods similar to those described in (5)) with a plausible translation mechanism. These additional potential coding ORFs were then added to the coding sequence annotations to increase the regions accessible for synplot2 analysis (which is only applicable to the protein-coding regions of a virus genome). Note that, while important for completing the annotation of less-well studied and poorly annotated virus species, predicted coding ORFs (except ones that had been previously experimentally confirmed) were not used to evaluate synplot2 performance.",

We chose 75% amino acid identity as the default cut-off so as to be able to detect features specific to single species or clades of closely related species, and also so that automated genome-wide alignments could be produced that mostly maintained the reading frame within coding regions. Maintenance of reading frame within coding regions is important for codon-based evolutionary analyses such as synplot2 and MLOGD. We used the alignment program code2aln version 1.2 (38), which uses both nucleotide and codon scoring metrics, to aid the generation of codon-respecting alignments. Nonetheless, insertion/deletion mutations and/or sequencing errors do occasionally lead to local shifts in reading-frame between different isolates. Thus, in each sequence, we masked regions that aligned locally out of frame with the RefSeq so that they could be excluded from the synplot2 and MLOGD analyses. Potential insertion/deletion sequencing errors in RefSeqs (e.g. where the RefSeq has a region that is locally out of frame with respect to all other sequenced isolates) were also flagged in this way. Using code2aln, sequences were aligned one by one with the RefSeq, and positions in each pairwise alignment that contained a gap character in the RefSeq were excluded. In this way, we built up a multiple sequence alignment mapped to the RefSeq genomic coordinates (if there were >200 full-length sequences, we chose 200 sequences at random; after subsequently removing duplicate sequences this typically resulted in alignments of slightly fewer than 200 sequences). The rationale for mapping sequences onto RefSeq coordinates is so that the coding sequence annotation can be defined by the RefSeq (amongst other things, making the analysis less susceptible to insertion/deletion sequencing errors in the non-reference sequences). The non-reference sequences may be thought of as informing a comparative-genomic annotation of the RefSeq.",

Where coding sequences overlap, the reading frame corresponding to the longest of multiple overlapping ORFs was used to define synonymous codons for the synplot2 analysis. Since analysis of a genome with a sliding window involves multiple tests, a basic threshold of 0.05 / (length of coding region / window size) was annotated on plots for individual virus genomes. This is an approximate Bonferroni-like correction so that, for a given virus genome, there is an \u223c5% probability that one or more regions evolving neutrally at synonymous sites would by chance register a signal beyond this threshold. To correct for multiple testing across the \u223c1300 individual alignments analyzed (including separate segment alignments for viruses with multipartite genomes), more stringent criteria were required. Around half of the alignments have sufficiently low sequence divergence that it is not possible for them to register significant (post Bonferroni correction) P-values, even in regions of 100% synonymous-site conservation, and such alignments should not contribute to a correction for multiple testing. We used a P-value threshold of 10\u22126 (25-codon window size) for selecting the conserved regions reported in Supplementary Dataset S1. We chose this threshold because, summed over the alignments, there are \u223c46 000 non-overlapping 25-codon windows coming from alignments with sufficient sequence divergence that 100% synonymous-site conservation in a 25-codon window would register a P-value of 10\u22126 or lower, giving rise to an expected probability of 46 000 \u00d7 10\u22126, i.e. \u223c5% of obtaining a single false positive over the analysis of all alignments.

The negative-sense templates of PRRSV sgRNAs are synthesized using a discontinuous transcription mechanism that results in an anti-leader sequence, templated by the very 5\u2019 end of the genomic RNA, being appended to the 3\u2019 end of each negative-sense sgRNA template, which is subsequently copied to a 5\u2019 leader sequence on each sgRNA (50). The polymerase skipping occurs at transcription-regulatory sequences (TRSs) positioned upstream of ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (\u2018+'s in Figure 3). Although the TRSs themselves comprise just a few nucleotides (UAACC or closely related sequences in PRRSV), synplot2 revealed regions of reduced synonymous-site variability at or just upstream of most TRS sites. The analysis of TuMV clearly revealed the overlapping pipo ORF (1) but also revealed extensive regions of reduced variability at synonymous sites at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the polyprotein-coding sequence (some of the latter may correspond to functional elements previously identified in related potyviruses) (51,52). Finally the analysis of IAV revealed, as observed previously using different methods (22), reduced synonymous-site variability in regions towards the termini of most segments which is thought to correspond to packaging signals, in a central region of the M1 ORF in segment 7, and in the dual-coding regions where the NS1 and NEP ORFs overlap, and where the PA and X ORFs overlap. In accordance with previous comments (53) we observed relatively weak purifying selection on the overlapping PB1-F2 ORF (54) in pan-IAV alignments.",

Since the randomly selected 2-sequence alignment was quite divergent (75% nucleotide identity), we also manually selected a low-divergence 2-sequence alignment (92% nucleotide identity). This provided a range of alignment divergences ranging from 0.08 to 6.85 nucleotide substitutions per site over the phylogenetic tree. For each alignment, we calculated the mean P-value across the alignment that would be achieved for various levels of reduced synonymous-site variability (i.e. obs/exp), and for a range of sliding window sizes (Figure 7). The P-value for a sliding window of size 9 codons and obs/exp = 0.7 represents the ability of synplot2 to detect an overlapping feature that leads to a 30% decrease in synonymous-site variability in a 9-codon window. As can be seen from Figures 1\u20136 and Tables 1 and 2, both overlapping genes and overlapping non-coding elements are frequently associated with >50% reductions in synonymous-site variability. For typical one-off analyses (e.g. P-value threshold of 0.05 with multiple testing corrections based on a single HEV-sized genome), an alignment divergence of \u223c0.25 may be sufficient to identify features of size \u226545 codons, such as many overlapping genes (Figure 7, panel 5). For non-coding elements, smaller window sizes (e.g. 7\u201325 codons) are generally more appropriate. For a 15-codon sliding window, an alignment divergence of \u223c0.85 may be sufficient to identify overlapping features (Figure 7, panel 3). Window sizes of 5 codons are only useful for the most highly sequenced species such as HEV, but are becoming accessible for more species as sequence databases continue to grow. Functional elements even smaller than 5 codons may be detected within 5-codon windows given sufficient reduction in synonymous-site variability, but window sizes smaller than 5 codons are best avoided due to fluctuations in sensitivity as a result of different levels of codon degeneracy (e.g. conserved columns of AUG Met or UGG Trp codons provide no synonymous site variation signal).",

Alignments containing recombinants typically contain regions where variability (both synonymous and non-synonymous) is reduced relative to the genome average. Potentially this can be problematic for the synplot2 analysis, where the divergence parameters and phylogenetic tree are assumed to be constant for the whole region analyzed. In the work presented here, we have not checked for nor removed recombinants as we have only rarely found recombination to be a significant issue for synplot2 analyses. Recombination tends to result in distinctive plateaux in the synplot2 P-value plots (an example is purposefully included in Figure 1) allowing problematic cases to be identified and reanalysed with recombinants excluded. Alternatively, standard recombination software can be used to pre-screen alignments for recombinants (57). A complementary strategy is to generate alignments for the coding regions of individual proteins (or separate regions of polyproteins) as fixed recombinations occur much more frequently between than within protein-coding domains. We have found synplot2 to be quite effective on alignments as short as 100 codons in length.",

Conserved regions at or near the 5\u2019 and/or 3\u2019 ends of the genomic coding regions were observed in many taxa, including potyviruses (Supplementary Figures S8.1 and S8.4), nepoviruses (Supplementary Figure S9.3), fabaviruses (Supplementary Figure S9.4), betaflexiviruses (Supplementary Figures S6.2, S6.6, S6.8, S7.1, S7.3, S7.4), cucumoviruses (Supplementary Figure S9.2), closteroviruses (Supplementary Figure S7.5), totivirids (Supplementary Figures S10.2, S10.3, S10.4) and birnaviruses (Supplementary Figures S10.5 and S10.6). Other conserved regions were observed within ORF6 of PRRSV (Figure 3) and in the 3\u2019 ORF (RdRp ORF) of the totivirids Leishmania RNA virus 1 (Supplementary Figure S10.4) and Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 (Supplementary Figure S10.3). Three conserved regions of note occurred in segment 10 of Bluetongue virus (\u2018?\u2019 in Supplementary Figure S12.1), segment S4 of Mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (\u2018?\u2019 in Supplementary Figure S13.1) and RNA2 of betanodaviruses (\u2018?\u2019 in Supplementary Figure S5.6). Each of these conserved regions coincides with a nearly conserved absence of stop codons in an alternative reading frame (+2 frame relative to the main coding ORF for the orthoreovirus and +1 frame for the other two), and may therefore indicate a novel overlapping coding ORF. In all three cases there is a suitable conserved AUG codon for AUG-initiated translation of the overlapping ORF. However the strong context of the AUG initiation codon of the main ORF, besides additional AUG codons in some sequences upstream of the AUG codon of the overlapping ORF, would be expected to inhibit leaky scanning, thus making the translational mechanism for these three potential novel ORFs uncertain. Further, the conservation signal in Bluetongue virus might also be compatible with a -1 frameshift to access a shorter overlapping ORF in the -1/+2 reading frame. Alternatively these conserved regions may represent novel non-coding elements.",

The apparent paucity of RNA structural elements may be due to a characteristic of negative-sense RNA virus replication, namely that the genomic and antigenomic RNAs are always found bound to multiple copies of the nucleocapsid protein (81), thus reducing their capacity to engage in RNA:RNA interactions. Indeed, although terminal sequences base-pair in bunyavirids (82,83), and stem-loop structures may play roles in transcription termination and translation (84,85), extensive RNA structure has been found to be generally lacking in negative-sense RNA viruses (86).",

Adjacent codon positions satisfying these conditions were merged into regions, and adjacent regions were merged if the gap between them was \u2264 24 codons (the rationale for this is that each selected codon position actually represents the midpoint of a 25-codon window).

ORF1 encodes the nonstructural protein domains which are translated from the genomic RNA. Both ORF3 (which encodes an accessory protein) and ORF2 (which encodes the capsid protein) are translated from a sgRNA; ORF3 is in the +1 reading frame with respect to ORF2. (a) Analysis of synonymous-site variability in an alignment of 192 HEV sequences (see the caption to Figure 1 for details) using a 5-codon sliding window to obtain a high-resolution map of overlapping functional elements. Here the two stem loops in the middle of the capsid-coding ORF are clearly resolved as separate features. Small breaks in the P-value and obs/exp lines at the starts of ORF3 and ORF2 indicate, respectively, the intergenic region between ORFs 1 and 3, and the junction between overlapping ORFs 2 and 3 where a partial codon (i.e. 2 nt) has been omitted from the calculations. (b) Analysis of the same alignment with a 25-codon sliding window. Larger sliding window sizes are more useful for identifying extended overlapping features such as overlapping genes. Here, the overlapping ORF3 is clearly revealed. (c) Provided the sequences are sufficiently divergent, even an alignment of two sequences (here, GenBank accession numbers NC_001434.1 and AB161718.1; 75-codon sliding window) can reveal extended features such as the overlapping ORF3. (d) The 192-sequence alignment was arbitrarily split into three 64-sequence alignments, and each alignment was analyzed separately (red, blue, green lines). All three alignments produce similar results. Note that a plot similar to (a), but based on a different sequence alignment, has been published previously (28).",

Synplot2 was applied to alignments of different numbers of HEV sequences randomly selected from the 192-sequence alignment used in Figure 6 (see text). For each alignment, the average P-value (filled circles) for the alignment was calculated for a given sliding window size (indicated at bottom right of each panel) and hypothetical level of reduced synonymous-site variability (obs/exp), a calculation which depends only on the null model. The \u2018divergence\u2019 of each alignment (measured by the mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site over the phylogenetic tree) is indicated at the bottom, and the number of sequences in each alignment is indicated at the top. The latter may be illustrative but is not a good indicator of alignment diversity, e.g. two 2-sequence alignments were used, one with an alignment divergence of 0.08 nucleotide substitutions per site and the other with an alignment divergence of 0.25 nucleotide substitutions per site. In each panel, the dashed line indicates a P-value of 0.05 corrected for multiple testing within the HEV genome (i.e. 0.05 / (HEV coding region size / window size); see Figure 1 caption). Larger features, lower obs/exp and higher alignment divergence correlate with increased synplot2 sensitivity.",

Functional RNA structural elements often fall in the range 7\u201325 codons; however window sizes below \u223c9\u201313 codons can produce noisy results and are best avoided except for the most highly sequenced species; a window size of 15 codons works well for many cases. Functional primary sequence elements (for example paramyxovirid transcriptional slippage sites, PAX-like +1 frameshift sites, protein binding sites and nidoviralid TRSs) are often <5 codons and might escape detection, though they are often associated with other features (overlapping genes in the first two cases, potential regulatory sequences in the last) that may be detected.",
