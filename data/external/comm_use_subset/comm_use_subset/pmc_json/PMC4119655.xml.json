            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is widely accepted as being one of the most economically important diseases affecting swine industry [1]. In 2006 there was an unparalleled large-scale outbreak of the so-called high fever disease in most provinces of China that affected more than 2,000,000 pigs, leading to concerns within the global swine industry and in relation to public health [2\u20134]. In March 2007 the disease was identified in the Hai Duong province of Vietnam and it spread countrywide affecting more than 65,000 pigs [5, 6]. The outbreaks caused extensive concern worldwide [7]. Studies demonstrated that highly virulent porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) was the major causative pathogen of the so-called high fever disease [2]. Genetic analysis indicated that the HP-PRRSVs isolated from China and Vietnam shared a discontinuous deletion of 30 aa in nonstructural protein 2 (NSP2), as compared with the North American type PRRSV strains (NA PRRSV) [2, 5, 8]. Since 2006, the HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV strains coexist in China. Now PRRS epidemic situation is very complicated in China, of which the predominant form is the HP-PRRSV. Rapid differential detection of the two strains of PRRSV is very important for effective PRRS control. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an assay for simultaneous detection and strain identification of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV.",

Both standard curves had a slope of \u22123.256 to \u22123.400 and an efficiency of 2.028 to 1.968, which indicate a high PCR efficiency of the experiment (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). Two TaqMan probes specific to HP-PRRSV and PRRSV strains combined in duplex real-time PCR system can specifically detect the two PRRSV strains. When the two TaqMan probes of Pb-H (FAM) and Pb-N (HEX) were combined in a duplex real-time PCR system, only the FAM fluorescent signal could be observed in the template of GD HP-PRRSV strain, and only the HEX fluorescent signal could be observed in the template of CH-1a PRRSV strain (Figure 4). However, when Pb-N (HEX) and Pb-all (FAM) were combined in a duplex real-time PCR system, only HEX fluorescent signal could be observed when the template was CH-1a PRRSV strain, and FAM fluorescent signal could be observed when the templates were GD and CH-1a strains (Figure 4).",

But the TaqMan probe method had the highest detection rate, whereas the conventional RT-PCR was the lowest. The SYBR Green I real-time PCR assay is timesaving, easy to handle, and highly sensitive. Yang et al. detected the PRRSV and CSFV RNA by SYBR Green I-based quantitative PCR and found that both sensitivity and specificity were equal or superior to conventional RT-PCR [14]. Although Tian et al. developed a rapid SYBR one step real-time RT-PCR for detection of PRRSV [15], it could not be used for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV (PRRSV). Kleiboeker et al. developed dual labeled probes quantitative PCR, which could simultaneously detect NA- and EU-PRRSV [16]. However, this assay could not simultaneously detect and differentiate between both HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV (PRRSV) strains in China. The TaqMan probe method provided more accurate results than SYBR Green I with melting curve analysis. SYBR Green I real-time PCR assay was simpler, rapider, and lower in cost than TaqMan probe method. In addition to the high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, the real-time PCR assay based on both SYBR Green I and TaqMan probe established by us could recognize coinfection of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. Because the two types of PRRSV isolates coexist in Chinese swine herds, recombination could occur. Therefore, the results provided alternative diagnostic assays in diverse PRRSV epidemiological circumstances.",
