They can cause severe diseases in livestock animals and lead thereby to high economic losses. In humans, coronavirus infections manifest usually as mild respiratory tract disease (common cold) that may cause more severe symptoms in elderly or immune-compromised individuals [2,3]. In 2002\u20132003, the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a formerly unknown coronavirus (SARS-CoV), exemplified the potential of coronaviruses to seriously affect human health [4\u20137]. The frequent detection of SARS-like coronaviruses in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sp.) and the broad range of mammalian hosts that are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection may facilitate a potential reintroduction into the human population [8]. Therefore, the development of efficacious coronavirus vaccines is of high medical and veterinary importance.",

            "text": "Effective vaccines controlling virus spread and disease are available for a number of infections, such as smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B [9,10]. Some of these vaccines consist of virus subunits or inactivated virus preparations that mainly induce the production of pathogen-specific antibodies. In contrast, live attenuated vaccines consist of replication-competent viruses that induce broad cellular and humoral immune responses without causing disease [10]. The most prominent live attenuated vaccines are vaccinia virus [11], poliovirus [12], and yellow fever virus (YF-17D) [13]. Despite their documented efficacy, it is still not fully understood why and how successful vaccines work [10,14]. However, recent concepts in immunology provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses and suggest that the quality, quantity, and longevity of adaptive immune responses is determined very early after infection or vaccination [14]. Of major importance are professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which play a major role in (i) sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns, (ii) inducing innate immune responses, and (iii) shaping the upcoming adaptive immune response. Efficient live attenuated vaccines should therefore not only lack significant pathogenicity, but should also deliver antigens to pAPCs and activate the innate immune system.",

An attractive strategy is to target virally encoded pathogenicity factors, such as interferon (IFN) antagonists [15], to attenuate virulence while retaining immunogenicity. This concept has been proposed for the generation of live attenuated influenza virus vaccines encoding altered NS1 proteins [16,17].",

For a number of reasons, the non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) is of particular interest in this context. First, coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses, and the replicase-encoded nsps are expressed from the viral genomic RNA immediately after virus entry by translation of two large polyproteins. nsp1 is encoded at the 5\u2032 end of the replicase gene and is therefore the first mature viral protein expressed in the host cell cytoplasm [21]. Second, a recent in vitro study suggests that SARS-CoV nsp1 may be associated with host cell mRNA degradation and may counteract innate immune responses [18]. Finally, nsp1 is encoded by all mammalian coronaviruses known to date (coronavirus groups 1, 2a, and 2b) [22], and recent structural data on SARS-CoV (group 2b) nsp1 suggest functional similarities to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; group 2a) nsp1 [23].",

Using transient gene expression studies, we found that MHV-A59, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E nsp1 significantly reduced luciferase reporter gene expression under the control of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), and SV40 promoters (Figure 1). This is consistent with a recent report suggesting that SARS-CoV nsp1 induces general host cell mRNA degradation [18]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the nsp1-mediated reduction in reporter protein expression appeared more robust for ISRE and SV40 than for IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven expression. Our data also support the hypothesis that MHV encodes a SARS-CoV nsp1 homolog that displays the same function [23]. Although comparative sequence analyses suggest that nsp1 of group 2a/2b coronaviruses (e.g., MHV and SARS-CoV, respectively) and the nsp1 of group 1 coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E) may belong to different protein families [22,23], we also observed reduced reporter gene expression in HCoV-229E nsp1-transfected cells (Figure 1). Whether functional similarities may exist between nsp1 molecules encoded by coronaviruses of different phylogenetic lineages remains to be established in future studies. Importantly, our data also revealed that reporter gene expression from all tested promoters was not affected when C-terminally truncated MHV nsp1 molecules were tested (Figure 1).",

As reported for a set of similar MHV mutants by Brockway et al.

To assess the stability of the recombinant MHV-nsp1\u039499, we analyzed the nsp1-coding region by RT-PCR sequencing after seven passages in tissue culture and no nucleotide changes were detected (unpublished data).",

            "text": "MHV-A59 is a hepatotropic and neurotropic virus that can cause acute hepatitis and encephalitis. Following intraperitoneal infection, virus replication is first detectable in spleen and liver, followed by virus spread to other organs, including the central nervous system. Hepatitis is the first clinical sign of disease, accompanied by elevated liver enzyme values in serum. Associated with the appearance of cytotoxic T cell responses approximately at day 5 post infection (p.i.), virus titers usually decline and are no longer detectable after day 7 p.i. Infections with a high dose (\u2265 5 \u00d7 106 pfu, intraperitoneal) may, however, occasionally result in fatality. To evaluate the importance of nsp1 for virus replication and viral pathogenicity in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with different doses of wild-type MHV or MHV-nsp1\u039499. Both viruses replicated in the spleen, whereby MHV-nsp1\u039499 titers were consistently lower than wild-type virus titers (Figure 3A). Furthermore, MHV-nsp1\u039499 was rapidly cleared and not detectable after day 2 p.i. (Figure 3A). Wild-type, but not mutant virus, was detectable in the liver at low and intermediate dose (50 pfu and 5,000 pfu, respectively) (Figure 3B). When high virus doses (5 \u00d7 106 pfu) were applied, MHV-nsp1\u039499 eventually reached the liver at day 2 p.i., but was not detectable at later time points (Figure 3B). MHV-nsp1\u039499 was not detectable in other non-hematopoietic organs, such as lung and central nervous system (unpublished data). Mice infected with wild-type virus showed acute liver disease with elevated liver enzyme values in serum. Furthermore, after high dose infection with wild-type virus (5 \u00d7 106 pfu), a significant weight loss that peaked at approximately 10%\u201315% at day 4 was observed (Figure 3E). In contrast, mice infected with the nsp1 mutant virus remained healthy after low, intermediate, or high dose infections. Even at the highest dose applied (5 \u00d7 106 pfu), MHV-nsp1\u039499\u2013infected mice did not lose weight (Figure 3E), and no elevated liver enzyme values were detected in the serum (Figure 3C). This observation correlated well with the absence of hepatocyte necrosis and parenchymal inflammation following MHV-nsp1\u039499 infection (Figure 3D). To further assess the attenuation of the MHV nsp1 mutant, mice were infected intracranially with 200 pfu and 20,000 pfu of MHV-nsp1\u039499 or MHV-A59. All mice infected with 200 pfu survived for at least 30 d (unpublished data). Mice infected with 20,000 pfu of MHV-A59 succumbed to the infection, whereas mice infected with 20,000 pfu of MHV-nsp1\u039499 survived and showed no signs of clinical disease (Figure 3F). Collectively, these data demonstrate that MHV-nsp1\u039499 is strongly attenuated in vivo, but has retained the ability to replicate in secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen.",

To test whether nsp1 has an influence on the induction of IFN-\u03b1, we infected both cDCs and pDCs with MHV-nsp1\u039499 or wild-type MHV. Both viruses elicited rapid and high IFN-\u03b1 production in Flt3-L\u2013differentiated bone marrow\u2013derived pDCs (Figure 4A) and FACS-sorted primary pDCs (Figure 4B). Furthermore, both wild-type and mutant MHV elicited only a late and weak IFN-\u03b1 production in cDCs (Figure 4A and 4B). These results suggest that nsp1 does not affect the induction of type I IFN. To assess a potential impact of nsp1 on type I IFN signaling and antiviral effector mechanisms in target cells that efficiently support MHV replication, cDCs and macrophages were pretreated with different dosages of IFN-\u03b1 and infected with MHV-nsp1\u039499 or wild-type MHV. In cDCs, IFN-\u03b1 treatment had a comparable effect on the replication of both MHV-nsp1\u039499 and the wild-type control virus (Figure 4C). However, replication of MHV-nsp1\u039499 was, in a dose-dependent manner, more vulnerable to IFN-\u03b1 treatment in macrophages (Figure 4D), suggesting that nsp1 might counteract IFN signaling and/or the antiviral activities of IFN-induced effector proteins.",

            "text": "Indeed, in vivo experiments in type I IFN receptor-deficient (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice [28] strongly support this interpretation. Infection of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice with wild-type MHV led to high titers in all tested organs (Figure 5A\u20135D), indicating that signals transmitted via the IFNAR are crucial for preventing uncontrolled spread of the virus [27]. Surprisingly, the severe attenuation of MHV-nsp1\u039499 in wild-type 129Sv mice was not present in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5A\u20135D). Replication of MHV-nsp1\u039499 in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice was largely restored and virus titers reached about 104\u2013105 pfu/g tissue in several organs after only 36 h (figures 5A\u20135D). These data strongly suggest that nsp1 has a pivotal role in counteracting type I IFN host responses and provide an explanation for the rapid clearance of MHV-nsp1\u039499 in wild-type mice. Interestingly, liver damage, measured as alanine 2-oxoglutarate-aminotransferase (ALT) levels in serum, was not yet detectable in MHV-nsp1\u039499\u2013infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice at 36 h p.i.

To assess the potential of MHV-nsp1\u039499 as an attenuated live vaccine, we replaced accessory gene 4 of MHV-nsp1\u039499 and wild-type MHV-A59 by a gene encoding a fusion protein of the immunodominant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (KAVYNFATC) of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GP33-GFP) [29]. The resulting recombinant viruses, MHV-nsp1\u039499-GP33-GFP and MHV-GP33-GFP, were used to infect C57BL/6 mice with different doses (50 and 5,000 pfu, intraperitoneal), and CD8+ T cell responses were assessed using flow cytometry\u2013based detection of intracellular IFN-\u03b3 following antigen-specific short-term in vitro restimulation.

In accordance with the recent report by Kamitani et al. [18], we observed reduced reporter gene expression in transient nsp1 expression studies. The suggestion that SARS-CoV nsp1 may play a role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis by promoting host cell mRNA degradation [18] has now received support through the analysis of a coronavirus nsp1 mutant in a murine model. The MHV nsp1 mutant phenotype led us to conclude that nsp1 mainly affects IFN signaling pathways or other downstream events. The influence on IFN-\u03b1 induction appears to be limited. These conclusions are based on several observations. First, the analysis of IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs and cDCs revealed no significant differences between wild-type and nsp1 mutant virus infections. Second, treatment of macrophages with IFN-\u03b1 revealed a more efficient reduction of MHV-nsp1\u039499 replication compared with that of wild-type MHV. Finally, and most strikingly, IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice were highly permissive for the mutant virus, and organ titers almost reached those of wild-type MHV-infected IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the nsp1 mutant virus replication was still slightly delayed in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, further studies are required to define molecular target(s) and the precise function(s) of coronavirus nsp1. Likewise, further studies are required to assess the impact of other coronaviral gene products on coronavirus pathogenicity. Recent reports indicate that coronaviruses most likely express a number of proteins, such as MHV and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid proteins, and SARS-CoV ORF3b and ORF6 proteins, that may interact with innate immune responses [19,20]. Also, the coronavirus replicase gene may harbor additional functions that play a role in virus\u2013host interactions. It has been shown that the MHV and SARS-CoV nsp2 proteins [30], and the highly conserved ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-monophosphatase activity [31] encoded in nsp3, are both dispensable for virus replication in tissue culture, and that a single point mutation in the MHV nsp14 confers a strong attenuation of MHV in mice [32]. Clearly, the murine model, with MHV as a natural mouse pathogen, will be highly advantageous in the examination of this issue, because it allows the use of well-characterized inbred and transgenic mice in combination with well-established immunological techniques required to assess the full range of coronavirus\u2013host interactions.",

It may well be that other coronaviral nsp1 molecules exert similar functions as the MHV nsp1. The coronavirus nsp1 has been suggested as a group-specific marker to differentiate group 1 coronaviruses from group 2a/2b coronaviruses [22]. Our transient nsp1 expression data indeed support the notion that SARS-CoV and MHV may encode evolutionarily conserved nsp1 homologs [22,23]. Nevertheless, further in vivo studies are required to determine whether the group 2b SARS-CoV nsp1 is indeed a functional equivalent to the structurally highly conserved group 2a nsp1 molecules encoded by MHV, bovine coronavirus, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyocarditis virus, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Likewise, it will be important to clarify in vivo, whether, despite the apparent lack of any sequence homology [22,23], the nsp1 of group 1 coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E) may represent a functional correlate to the nsp1 of group 2a/2b coronaviruses. Recent progress in the establishment of suitable mouse models for SARS-CoV [33\u201335] and HCoV-229E [36] will enable researchers to address these questions in future studies.",

One important aspect of protection against viral infections is the induction of specific cytotoxic T cells by pAPCs in secondary lymphoid organs [14]. A number of coronaviruses, such as MHV, HCoV-229E, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and SARS-CoV, have been shown to infect pAPCs and to replicate in the secondary lymphoid organs [27,37\u201342]. Because of their pronounced tropism for pAPCs and the induction of strong CTL responses, we propose that coronaviruses represent promising vectors for the expression of heterologous antigens. The identification of nsp1 as a major pathogenicity factor will significantly increase the safety of coronavirus-based vectors [43]. For example, the deletion of accessory genes (i.e., not replicase or structural genes) has been described for some coronaviruses to confer attenuation in the natural host [44\u201346], and the deletion of the structural envelope protein E has resulted in the development of replication-competent, but propagation-deficient, coronavirus vectors [47,48]. Now, with an accompanying deletion in the nsp1-coding sequence, such vectors would be considered \u201crecombination proof\u201d, because the deletions are located at opposite genomic regions (i.e., within the replicase gene at the 5\u2032 end and within the structural gene region at the 3\u2032 end of the coronavirus genome), which make the reconstruction of virulent viruses by recombination unlikely. We therefore suggest that accessory gene, E gene, and partial nsp1 gene deletions will result in particular safe vectors with the potential to express multiple heterologous antigens [40,49].",

Briefly, the gene to be mutated was replaced by the Escherichia coli guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT) gene through vaccinia virus\u2013mediated homologous recombination, and GPT-positive clones were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on CV-1 cells in the presence of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and mycophenolic acid (GPT-positive selection) [50]. In a second round, the GPT gene was replaced by the mutated gene, and GPT-negative clones, containing the mutated gene, were selected by three rounds of plaque purification on D980R cells in the presence of 6-thioguanine (GPT-negative seletion) [50]. To construct the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the MHV-nsp1\u039499 cDNA, the 5\u2032 end of the MHV-A59 cDNA in vMHV-inf-1 was replaced by GPT using the plasmid pRec4. This plasmid is based on pGPT-1 [50], and the GPT gene is flanked to its left by 500 bp of vaccinia DNA and to its right by an internal ribosomal entry sequence (IRES) followed by MHV-A59 nts 952-1315. The GPT-negative selection was carried out using the plasmid pRec15. This plasmid contains 250 bp of vaccinia DNA followed by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter, one G nucleotide, and MHV nts 1\u2013828 linked to MHV nts 928-1315. To replace the MHV-A59 accessory gene 4 in vMHV-inf-1 and vMHV-nsp1\u039499 by a gene encoding a fusion protein of EGFP and the LCMV-derived CTL epitope KAVYNFATC (GP33-GFP) [29], the plasmid pRec8 was used for recombination with vaccinia viruses vMHV-inf-1 and vMHV-nsp1\u039499 . This plasmid contains the GPT gene flanked to its left by MHV nts 27500\u201327967 and to its right by MHV nts 28265\u201328700. GPT-negative selection was carried out using the plasmid pRec9. This plasmid contains MHV bp 27500\u201327967, the GP33-GFP gene, and MHV nts 28265\u201328700. Further cloning details, plasmid maps, and sequences are available from the authors upon request.
