Such situations represent a form of parasite-mediated apparent competition [6] which can threaten the persistence of spill-over host species [1]. In principle, such disease threats could be mitigated by management (e.g. vaccination) directed at reservoir hosts. This approach may be attractive, especially where \u2013 as is often the case [7] \u2013 reservoir hosts are domestic animals which can be managed more readily than elusive threatened wildlife. However, reservoir hosts can be hard to recognise [5] and, in some cases, there may be no external reservoir [8].",

Wild dogs occur at low population densities, living in highly cohesive territorial social groups (packs) [19], [20], [21], [22]. Simple epidemiological models predict that the high contact rates which occur within social groups will elevate the prevalence of directly transmitted infections [23], a prediction which is broadly supported by empirical data [24]. Hence, exposure might be especially high in large wild dog packs once a pathogen is introduced. However, encounters between packs are rare due to low population density and territorial behaviour, so there may be few opportunities for pathogen transmission between packs [25]. These behavioural effects on contact patterns suggest that intraspecific pathogen transmission is likely to be frequency-dependent rather than density-dependent [26].",

Wild dog pack territories can be clearly identified as falling on one or the other land use type [20], [33], but population characteristics and ranging patterns are similar in the two land uses [20], [33]. Local people keep domestic dogs in both land use types, for security at bomas (livestock corrals where most people and domestic dogs reside) and to accompany grazing herds.

Second, we used the date of sampling (measured in days since 1 Jan 2001) as a proxy to estimate contact probability, since wild dog population size, density, and home range overlap all increased over time [20], [33]. Third, we estimated wild dogs' risk of contact with other packs in the 12 months prior to sampling, using aerial telemetry data. Full details of the estimation method are given in ref [25] but, in brief, we used nine years of aerial radio-telemetry data to estimate the average frequency of contact between neighbouring wild dog packs per active period, and then multiplied this frequency by the number of packs with home ranges overlapping or adjoining that of the sampled wild dog in the 12 months before sampling. This risk of contacting other packs was only estimated for wild dogs with known movement patterns over the previous 12 months, that is, animals which throughout this period either were radio-collared themselves, or were known to have been members of a pack with at least one radio-collared member..",

Contrary to expectation, exposure to parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora were associated with small pack size (rather than large pack size as would be expected if high intra-pack contact increased exposure). Although such negative associations between social group size and pathogen exposure are unusual [24], they have been observed in other host-pathogen systems [51]. One potential explanation for these negative associations is that parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora might increase wild dog (especially pup) mortality [13], [14], [15], [16] and hence themselves suppress pack size. Since pack size is unrelated to home range size in this population [20], variation in home range size is unlikely to explain these negative associations. Rising wild dog density over time was likewise not linked to increasing pathogen exposure. Contrary to expectation, exposure to coronavirus declined significantly over time, and similar patterns (albeit non-significant) were observed for all of the viral pathogens (Figure 2). We speculate that these patterns might reflect gradual fading-out of infections following recolonisation of the study area from community lands [33] where average rates of domestic dog contact, and hence pathogen exposure, may have been higher. The behavioural measure of inter-pack contact was not significantly associated with exposure to any of the pathogens.",

Empirical data on both contact rates [25] and pathogen exposure [36] suggest that, in this study area, domestic dogs do act as a reservoir for rabies virus: infection appears to persist in the domestic dog population, but not in the wild dog population [36], probably because domestic dogs occur at high densities with high intraspecific contact rates, whereas wild dogs live at low population densities with few opportunities for transmission between packs [25]. In contrast, the other pathogens found to be associated with domestic dog contact \u2013 parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora \u2013 might in principle be maintained in low-density host populations, like those of wild dogs, without the involvement of another primary host species [52]. This is partly because their transmission does not require direct contact between hosts, being able to survive in, respectively, the environment, a tick vector, and ungulate prey [52] and, in the case of Neospora, also being vertically transmitted [32]. It is possible that domestic dog populations function as reservoirs for these pathogens but, alternatively, domestic dog contact may simply elevate the prevalence of these infections among wild dogs, without being necessary for infection to persist. The latter appears especially likely for Neospora, which occurs at higher prevalence in wild dogs than in domestic dogs (Table 1), with high prevalence perhaps being maintained by vertical transmission. We note that exposure to all of the pathogens considered here has been recorded among wild dogs inhabiting large protected areas remote from domestic dogs [9], [14], [17], [49], [53]; hence the absence of domestic dogs does not guarantee total protection from any of these pathogens.",

However, exposure to these pathogens \u2013 and by extension contact with domestic dogs \u2013 is not necessarily harmful in all cases. Indeed, the fact that we detected evidence of exposure to these pathogens in apparently healthy wild dogs, in a growing population, shows that exposure is not invariably fatal, and did not cause population decline at the level of domestic dog contact observed here. Exposure to these pathogens may maintain some level of immunity in the population, helping to prevent large outbreaks from occurring or mitigating their lethality, and may also help to maintain selection pressure for disease resistance. The balance between these positive and negative effects is likely to vary between pathogens, suggesting that a single management strategy (e.g., domestic dog removal) might not be appropriate for all pathogens. However, substantial increases in contact between wild dogs and domestic dogs \u2013 as might occur through land use change [25] \u2013 would be expected to increase pathogen exposure for wild dogs and could undermine population viability.",

Among the pathogens we studied, rabies virus has the clearest record of causing mortality in wild dogs [9], [10], [54], [55], [56] and is thus the most likely to require management intervention. The findings presented here, combined with those from other studies [25], [36], [57] suggest that, in principal, wild dogs might (where necessary) be protected from rabies by vaccinating either domestic dogs or wild dogs themselves. Both of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses: domestic dog vaccination can fail to protect wildlife if conducted over too small an area [2], but has the added advantage of protecting human health [58], whereas wild dog vaccination directly targets the host of conservation concern but has proven controversial in the past [59]. Deciding which form of management is most appropriate therefore requires a careful analysis of costs and benefits. Canine distemper virus is less likely than rabies virus to require management, since it has less of a history of causing wild dog mortality (but see [11], [12]). However, should this virus seriously threaten a wild dog population, vaccination of domestic dogs might have no conservation benefit since there is growing evidence to suggest that this pathogen is not always maintained in domestic dog populations [36], [49], [50]. Protecting wild dogs from canine distemper would therefore need to target wild dogs themselves. For the other pathogens studied here, both disease dynamics and impacts on wild dog populations and are less certain; hence, deciding on the most appropriate form of management (if any) remains problematic.",

Identifying such links required detailed data on the behaviour of both host species, highlighting one practical challenge of recognising reservoirs of pathogens affecting wildlife [5], even when one of the hosts is a domestic species.
