            "text": "The binding of an infectious virus particle through attachment factors and receptors on the host cell surface is the essential first step for the viral entry and subsequent replication therein (1, 2). Generally, attachment factors facilitate the concentration of the incoming virus particles on the cell surface but do not actively promote entry and mediate signals, whereas receptors bind the viruses, promote entry, and activate cellular signaling pathways (3). Viral attachment factors and receptors on host cells comprise a large variety of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids with physiological functions unrelated to pathogen interaction (3). For many viruses, these receptors are glycans linked to either a protein (glycoprotein or proteoglycan) or a glycolipid (4\u20136). Glycan-dependent viruses use glycoepitopes as receptors, binding to negatively charged sialic acids (SAs), sulfated oligosaccharide motifs of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, or neutral glycoepitopes such as those found on histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) (6). SAs at the termini or inner portions of glycan chains serve as receptors for at least 10 different virus families, whereas representatives from at least eight different virus families use GAG chains as receptors (4\u20137). In contrast, only a few human and animal viruses within a few families, including Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and Reoviridae, use HBGAs as receptors (2, 6, 8). The selection of different glycoepitopes as attachment factors may contribute to virus tropism, pathogenesis, and host specificity (5, 6, 8, 9).",

The initial observation that the Lagovirus RHDV uses the H type 2 HBGA as an attachment factor (20) inspired studies to identify similar factors for the other members of the Caliciviridae family (21). These studies showed that different HBGAs are used as attachment factors for human NoVs (HuNoVs) (21, 22), bovine NoV (23), canine NoVs (24), and primate enteric caliciviruses within the Recovirus genus (25). In contrast, FCV (26), murine NoV (MNV) (27), and porcine SaV (PSaV) (28) utilize terminal SAs as attachment factors. Recently, it was observed that some HuNoVs and monkey recoviruses also utilize SAs as attachment factors (29, 30). Finally, proteinaceous cellular surface structures were identified as receptors for a few caliciviruses, such as CD300lf and CD300ld for MNV (31, 32) and junctional adhesion molecule-1 (JAM-1) for FCV and Hom-1 calicivirus (33\u201335).",

            "text": "HBGAs are complex carbohydrates linked to glycoproteins or glycolipids found in red blood cells and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts in a wide variety of species (2, 8). They can also be secreted as free oligosaccharides into bodily fluids, such as saliva, intestinal content, milk, and blood (2, 8). The ABH and Lewis HBGAs are synthesized by the stepwise addition of monosaccharide units to five different types of precursor: type 1 (Gal\u03b2-3GlcNAc\u03b21-R), type 2 (Gal\u03b2-4GlcNAc\u03b21-R), type 3 (Gal\u03b2-3GalNAc\u03b11-R), type 4 (Gal\u03b2-3GalNAc\u03b21-R), and type 5 (Gal\u03b2-4Glc\u03b21-Cer) (36). Each step is catalyzed by specific glycosyltransferases, such as \u03b1-1,2 fucosyltransferase (FUT2), \u03b1-1,3 or \u03b1-1,4 fucosyltransferase (FUT3), and two glycosyltransferases (A and B enzymes) (2, 8). For example, the \u03b1-1,2 fucosyltransferase adds a fucose residue at the \u03b1-1,2 linkage position of galactose, generating H antigen motifs (2, 8). The addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) or galactose at the \u03b1-1,3 position of H type chains via A enzyme or B enzyme results in either A or B antigen (2, 8, 24). The FUT3 gene, as well as the FUT4, FUT5, FUT6, FUT7, and FUT9 genes, generate the Lewis antigens by adding a fucose residue at either the \u03b1-1,3 or \u03b1-1,4 linkage position of the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in the type 1 and/or type 2 precursors (2, 8, 24).",

            "text": "The genus Nebovirus contains one established type species, Newbury-1 virus, that contains Nebraska-like and Newbury-1-like clades (37, 38). Recently, two more species in the genus Nebovirus have been identified (39, 40). The reported fecal prevalence of the bovine nebovirus (BNeV) in calf diarrhea is 5% in Tunisia (41), 4.8% in Brazil (42), 7% in France (40), 9.1% in Korea (38), 13.1% in Italy (43), and 21.6% in the United States (44). Moreover, the BNeV prototype strains Newbury-1 and Nebraska experimentally induce diarrhea and small intestinal pathology, such as the desquamation of villous epithelial cells and villous atrophy in gnotobiotic calves (45\u201347). Despite its significant economic impact on the livestock industry and status as a pathogen with zoonotic potential, the BNeV life cycle remains largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation systems. Based on the information that either SAs or HBGAs are used as attachment factors for many caliciviruses, we hypothesized that BNeV also recognizes either SAs or HBGAs as attachment factors for entry and infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the interaction between BNeV virus-like particles (VLPs) and either SAs or HBGAs using a comprehensive series of BNeV-ligand biochemical assays in synthetic HBGAs, bovine and human saliva samples, cell cultures, and bovine intestinal tissue sections.",

HBGA-dependent VLPs from the HuNoV strain VA387 showed a binding pattern similar to that of BNeV, indicative of binding to neutral sugars (51, 52). However, 1 or 10 mM NaIO4 pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on the binding of the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strain Nancy, which is known to use decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a cellular receptor (7, 53).",

As expected, binding of BNeV VLPs increased to 124% with the 1 mM NaIO4 treatment and decreased to 55% with the 10 mM NaIO4 treatment compared with the mock-treated, VLP-inoculated control (Fig. 2B).

Pretreatment of MDBK cells with NA increased the binding of AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs to cells (Fig. 3A), and the binding of RI-labeled BNeV VLPs to cells increased to 123% of the levels observed in the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3B). A similar degree of enhanced binding was observed in the cells treated with HBGA-dependent HuNoV P particles (Fig. 3A). However, SA-dependent FCV showed a marked reduction in cell binding, whereas with DAF-dependent CVB3 the NA pretreatment had no influence on the degree of binding to cells (Fig. 3). These results support the notion that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors and that it uses neutral carbohydrate motifs such as HBGAs instead.",

The results showed that treatment with \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase, which removes the \u03b1-1,2-linked fucose from galactose, significantly decreased the binding of BNeV VLPs to the H type disaccharide, H1 and H2 types, and Ley carrying an \u03b11,2-linked fucose epitope (Fig. 4B), suggesting that BNeV VLPs recognize the \u03b11,2-linked fucose as an epitope. In contrast, pretreatment with \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase resulted in a significant reduction in the binding of BNeV VLPs to SLea, Lex, SLex, and Ley, which all harbor the \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitope (Fig. 4B), confirming binding specificity for this epitope. An almost complete reduction in the binding of BNeV VLPs to Ley, containing both \u03b11,2- and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes, was observed by combined pretreatment of synthetic Ley with both enzymes, \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase and \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase, supporting the above-described results that BNeV VLPs recognize both \u03b11,2-linked fucose and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose. Pretreatment of the Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA with \u03b1-galactosidase, which cleaves the \u03b1Gal epitope in Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA, had no inhibitory effect on the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA (Fig. 4B).

An analogous result was obtained for binding to a range of human saliva samples, regardless of the contents of individual HBGAs (Fig. 6B).

Four bovine saliva samples were selected, two of which represented the H+/A+/B\u2212 type (samples 2 and 4) and two of which represented the H+/A\u2212/B\u2212 type (samples 6 and 10). As each bovine saliva sample expressed different levels of A type, H type 2, Ley type, and Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2, pretreatment with individual enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV to each saliva sample only mildly (Fig. 8A). However, pretreatment of saliva samples with a mixture of \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase and \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase resulted in greater inhibition (Fig. 8A). In addition, pretreatment of the bovine saliva samples with \u03b1-galactosidase and \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase did not inhibit the binding of BNeV VLPs to any of the selected bovine saliva samples (Fig. 8A), supporting the interpretation that the \u03b1Gal and GalNAc epitopes are not recognized by the BNeV VLPs. To assess the function of \u03b1-galactosidase, the inhibitory effect of \u03b1-galactosidase on the binding of the GST-VP8* protein of \u03b1Gal-dependent bovine rotavirus P[5] strain WC3 to each of the bovine saliva samples was examined.

            "text": "To further define the BNeV-binding HBGA epitopes, the expression levels of the different HBGAs were examined in several cell lines using antibodies specific for each HBGA. The bovine kidney epithelial MDBK, porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK, canine kidney epithelial MDCK, and feline kidney CRFK cells solely expressed Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA. Human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells expressed H types 1 and 2, Lea, Lex, Leb, and Ley HBGAs, while human embryonic kidney epithelial 293T cells did not express any of the HBGAs examined. Among these cell lines, MDBK cells were selected to check whether \u03b1Gal is recognized as an attachment factor for BNeV binding because of sole expression of the \u03b1Gal epitope carrying Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA on the cell surface, whereas Caco-2 cells were selected to check whether \u03b11,2-fucose and \u03b11,3/4-fucose epitopes are used as BNeV attachment factors because of expression of multiple HBGAs containing \u03b11,2-fucose and \u03b11,3/4-fucose epitopes on the cell surface HBGAs. The binding of AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs to each cell line was then examined both before and after removal of all of the corresponding HBGAs expressed in each cell line by pretreatment with \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase, \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase, \u03b1-galactosidase, or \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, either individually or in combination. As expected, removal of \u03b1Gal from Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA by pretreatment with \u03b1-galactosidase had no inhibitory effect on BNeV binding to the MDBK cells, supporting the conclusion that Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA is not used for BNeV attachment (Fig. 9A). To confirm the efficacy of \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase, \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase, and \u03b1-galactosidase, MDBK and Caco-2 cells were pretreated with each enzyme and then the samples were checked for efficient removal of fucose by using Ulex Europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1), which detects fucose residues (59), or an antibody specific to \u03b1Gal. The pretreatment of cells with \u03b1-galactosidase markedly removed \u03b1Gal residue from MDBK cells, whereas a mixture of \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase and \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase significantly removed fucose residues from Caco-2 cells (data not shown). Interestingly, pretreatment of MDBK cells with each fucosidase significantly decreased BNeV VLP binding (Fig. 9A). These effects became more apparent when the cells were pretreated with the mixture (Fig. 9A), even though the cells did not appear to express fucosylated HBGAs. This suggests that \u03b11,2- and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose residues not detected by these reagents nonetheless support the binding of BNeV VLPs to MDBK cells. Pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with either \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase or \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase also reduced the binding of BNeV VLPs (Fig. 9B). The reduction was much enhanced by pretreatment of the Caco-2 cells with the \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase and \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase mixture (Fig. 9B), indicating that BNeV VLP binding involved the \u03b11,2-linked fucose and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes of HBGAs.",

Whether the above-described binding between BNeV VLPs and HBGAs was similar to that found in parental CHO or transfectant CHO cells, parent and transfectant CHO cells expressing H type 2, A type, B type, or Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGAs were examined. After the expression of each target HBGA in parental CHO and transfectant CHO cells, as confirmed (Fig. 10A), binding of BNeV VLPs to parental and transfectant CHO cells was analyzed. Compared with that of parental CHO cells (H\u2212/A\u2212/B\u2212), to which AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs failed to attach, binding of BNeV VLPs was very prominent in CHO cells expressing H type 2 HBGA (H+/A\u2212/B\u2212) (Fig. 10B). It was also detected, albeit less extensively, with A (H+/A+/B\u2212) and B (H+/A\u2212/B+) types (Fig. 10B). As expected, CHO cells expressing Gal\u03b13Gal\u03b24GlcNAc\u03b2 HBGA had no BNeV VLP binding (Fig. 10B). Taken together, these findings support the overall conclusion that BNeV VLPs have a wide HBGA binding spectrum through specific reorganization of \u03b11,2- and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose residues in the HBGAs.",

As found for the inhibitory effects of HBGA epitope-specific enzymes against BNeV binding to synthetic HBGAs (Fig. 4B), bovine and human saliva samples (Fig. 8), or cultured cells (Fig. 9), pretreatment of O or A blood type duodenal sections with \u03b1-galactosidase or \u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase produced no inhibitory BNeV binding effects (Fig. 11). However, pretreatment of these duodenal sections with \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase significantly reduced BNeV VLP binding. Pretreatment of duodenal sections with \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase partially inhibited the binding of BNeV VLPs to the duodenal epithelium, while pretreatment of the duodenal sections with a combination of \u03b11,2-l-fucosidase and \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase almost completely abolished the binding of BNeV VLPs to the duodenal epithelium (Fig. 11). Taken together, these results indicate that BNeV VLPs can attach to bovine as well as human glycan compounds on the surface of epithelial cells containing \u03b11,2-linked fucose and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes, as found in most HBGA epitopes.",

Many caliciviruses attach to cell surface carbohydrate moieties, such as HBGAs or SAs (2, 28). Here, we demonstrate that VLPs of the BNeV bind to a wide spectrum of HBGAs present as synthetic neoglycoconjugates, secreted in bovine and human saliva, or expressed by cultured cells and bovine duodenal epithelium. Among HBGA-dependent caliciviruses, some HuNoVs, particularly some GII.4 strains and the recently emerged GII.17 strains, are well known to have a wide binding spectrum of HBGAs in all ABO, Lewis, and secretor/nonsecretor types (2, 58, 61, 62). Generally, it is considered that the multiple binding patterns of HuNoVs to HBGAs could be subdivided into two major binding groups: the A/B or Lewis binding groups (2, 51, 52). The A/B binding group members, including VA387, Norwalk, and MOH strains, are considered to accommodate one or two epitopes of A/B and H HBGAs, i.e., galactose and/or \u03b11,2-linked fucose. In contrast, the Lewis binding group members, such as the Boxer, VA207, and OIF strains, utilize \u03b11,2-linked fucose and/or \u03b11,3-linked fucose epitopes of H and Lewis HBGAs. In the present study, enzymatic removal of \u03b11,2- and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucoses from the various HBGA backbones reduced BNeV binding to the corresponding synthetic HBGAs and saliva samples. These data indicate that similar to the human Lewis binding group, BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs via binding to their \u03b11,2- and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitopes (2, 51, 52, 58, 61). As expected, removal of the \u03b1Gal or GalNAc epitopes had no inhibitory effect on BNeV VLP binding, indicating that BNeV does not use the \u03b1Gal and GalNAc epitopes as attachment factors. Indeed, it is well known that bovine genogroup III NoV uses the \u03b1Gal epitope, which is absent from human and pig gut epithelium, suggesting that neither humans nor pigs could be infected by bovine NoVs (23). However, this remains to be explored.",

In addition, there is a slight reduction in BNeV binding to the bovine duodenal sections with the \u03b11,3/4-l-fucosidase pretreatment because the \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitope is present only in Ley HBGA.

Both SLea and SLex are expressed at high concentrations in cancer cells such as human colon cancer but only minimally in nontransformed cells, defining their utility as diagnostic cancer markers in human medicine (63).

Interestingly, recent studies have shown that in addition to HBGAs, SAs also can be used as an attachment factor(s) for HuNoVs and Tulane virus, the prototype of the Recovirus genus; \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked SAs, particularly \u03b12,3-linked SA containing GM3, possibly act as attachment factors for HuNoV VA387 (GII.4) and VA115 (GI.3) strains, whereas \u03b12,6-linked terminal SAs are likely utilized by Tulane virus (29, 30). In contrast to the reduced binding observed for the Tulane virus (29), in this study, removal of terminal SAs from cell surface carbohydrates by NA and 1 mM NaIO4 had no inhibitory effect on the binding of BNeV VLPs to the cells. Rather, pretreatment with NA and 1 mM NaIO4 increased BNeV VLP binding. This may be due to increased access to fucosylated epitopes following removal of the charged SA motifs. However, pretreatment with 10 mM NaIO4 markedly decreased the BNeV binding to the cells, possibly due to complete removal of HBGAs on the cell surface (23). The lack of inhibition following NA treatment does not rule out the possibility that the internal SAs of gangliosides like GM1a are recognized (64). However, the lack of sensitivity with the 1 mM NaIO4 treatment strongly suggests that this is not the case.",

Therefore, it was anticipated that \u03b11,2- and \u03b11,3/4-linked fucose epitope-dependent BNeV VLPs would not bind the cell surface of MDBK cells. Unexpectedly, however, BNeV VLPs attached to MDBK cells and pretreatment of MDBK cells with these fucosidases inhibited BNeV binding to MDBK cells. The mechanism by which BNeV VLPs bind to MDBK cells remains unclear. Nevertheless, these data suggest that MDBK cells express fucosylated HBGAs, which could not be detected by the antibodies used in this study but could be degraded by fucosidases.

Some NoVs detected in humans and animals have a close genetic relationship and share target receptors, which has raised questions regarding the possibility of the zoonotic transmission of these viruses (24, 68). For example, porcine NoV strains detected worldwide have close genetic relatedness to HuNoVs (69\u201376). Moreover, HuNoV strain GII.4-HS66 induces diarrhea and intestinal pathology in piglets and calves, respectively (77, 78). Recent studies have shown that primate enteric caliciviruses within the Recovirus genus share their HBGA attachment factors with HuNoVs (25, 79). Furthermore, the zoonotic potential of these viruses has been clearly demonstrated by the high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (80, 81). In the present study, BNeV utilized HBGAs that are commonly used by HuNoVs and other enteric caliciviruses. This suggests that BNeVs have the potential to infect humans and/or other species. In particular, VLPs from BNeV displayed wide-spectrum binding in human saliva and human and animal cell lines, further supporting the above-described hypothesis. It should be noted that bovines express type 2-based HBGAs in their digestive tract but humans have type 1-based structures in their digestive tract. Accordingly, HuNoVs appear to favor the recognition of type 1-based HBGAs (82, 83). BNeVs might be less adapted to human infection, as neither the virus nor its specific antibody have been isolated from and detected in humans.",

Although robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation systems for BNeVs have not been established, more definitive evidence for the interspecies transmission of BNeVs can be obtained by the inoculation of the BNeV isolates into different species, such as human volunteers or piglets. Indirect evidence for interspecies transmission of BNeVs can be provided by the detection of antibodies against BNeVs in serum samples collected from humans and other animals, particularly those living in the above-described environments (80, 84, 85).

Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), Crandell-Reese feline kidney (CRFK), human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells, purchased from the ATCC, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (7, 85). The parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that do not express HBGAs (H\u2212/A\u2212/B\u2212) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 10 \u03bcg/ml each of adenosine, 2-deoxy-adenosine, and thymidine (60). In addition, single-transfectant CHO cells expressing the H antigen (H+/A\u2212/B\u2212) or the \u03b1Gal antigen and double-transfectant CHO cells expressing either the A antigen (H+/A+/B\u2212) or the B antigen (H+/A\u2212/B+) were cultured under the conditions described for the parental CHO cells, with addition of 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin and 0.25 mg/ml of G418 (neomycin) to maintain the plasmids expressing the glycosylation enzymes (60). Sf9 cells, purchased from Gibco (Fort Worth, TX), were cultured at 27\u00b0C in SF-900 II SFM medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, lipid medium supplement, and 0.1% pluronic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The FCV F9 strain (ATCC) and CVB3 Nancy strain were propagated in CRFK cells and HeLa cells, respectively (26, 87). Cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient ultracentrifugation was used to purify each mass-cultured strain as described elsewhere (7).",

Briefly, the complete 2.3-kb capsid region (encoding the VP1-major capsid and VP2-minor capsid regions) of Bo/BNeV/MA415/04/KR was amplified from the above-described fecal sample by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with forward (5\u2032-AAACATGAGTGACAACAAAAGCATCCCAGA-3\u2032, nucleotide position 5055 to 5084 of VP1 region) and reverse (5\u2032-TCAAACACTCGTGGTCGAGAACACTGAC-3\u2032, nucleotide position 7360 to 7387 of VP2 region) primers designed from the full-length sequence of Newbury agent 1 strain in the GenBank database (accession number NC_007916). The amplicon was ligated into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, CA) and then transformed to DH5\u03b1 competent cells (Enzynomics, Daejeon, South Korea). Plasmids were purified using GeneAll Hybrid-Q Plasmid Rapidpre (GeneAll, Seoul, South Korea), and the sequence (GenBank accession numbers EF528565 and MG009451) was verified using an ABI system 3700 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Using purified plasmid, the full-length cDNA copy of capsid gene was amplified by PCR with a forward primer (5\u2032-CACAGGATCCATGAGTGACAACAAAAGCAT-3\u2032) containing a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and reverse primer (5\u2032-AATCTCGAGTCAAACACTCGTGGTCG-3\u2032) containing an XhoI restriction site (underlined). After digestion with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes, the amplified fragments were subcloned into pFastBac1 baculovirus donor plasmid (ThermoFisher Scientific, Seoul, South Korea). The pFastBac1 donor plasmid was transformed into DH10Bac Escherichia coli, and its resultant recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin II reagent (by following the manufacturer's instructions; Invitrogen). BNeV VLPs were expressed in baculovirus recombinant-transformed Sf9 insect cells at 27\u00b0C and harvested at 5 to 7 days postinfection. The cloned recombinant baculovirus generated from pFastBac1 plasmid containing VP1 and VP2 regions of MA415 strain was designated rMA415 and propagated in Sf9 cells to make master virus stocks. BNeV VLPs were purified using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation as described elsewhere (7). The protein concentrations of the VLPs were determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of recombinant capsid protein was validated by electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses as described elsewhere (48, 49, 88).",

Briefly, the confluent cells grown on eight-chamber slides were left untreated or were treated with chemicals or enzymes and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. For detection of the BNeV capsid proteins in the Sf9 cells, mock- or rMA415-infected Sf9 cells grown on microscope cover slides were harvested at 48 and 72 h postinfection and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then permeabilized by the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS containing 0.1% newborn calf serum (PBS-NCS). MAbs specific for each HBGA and a polyclonal antibody against BNeV capsid protein were added to each chamber or cover slide, and the slides were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The cells were then washed three times with PBS-NCS, and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were added. After washing, the cells were treated with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution for the staining of nuclei, mounted using SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen), and then examined under an EZ-C1 confocal microscope using EZ-C1 software (Nikon, Japan). Another set of eight-chamber slides treated as described above was added with AF594-labeled BNeV VLPs and was used to observe binding as described above. For detecting the BNeV capsid protein in the infected Sf9 cells, mock- or rMA415-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the cells were mounted with 60% glycerol in PBS (pH 8.0) and then examined under a fluorescence microscope.",
