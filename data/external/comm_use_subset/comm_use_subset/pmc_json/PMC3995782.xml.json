CHIKV belongs to the genus Alphavirus of the family Togaviridae and is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome [3]. The 12kb RNA genome is capped at the 5\u2032 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end and consists of two open reading frames coding for four non-structural proteins (nsP1\u20134), three major structural proteins (Capsid, E1, and E2) and two small cleavage products (E3 and 6K) [3], [4]. The E1 and E2 glycoproteins form heterodimers that associate as trimeric spikes on the virion surface while E3 and 6K were demonstrated to act as helper proteins in the budding and maturation process of the virion envelope [5]\u2013[7].",

More recently, new episodes of CHIKF have been reported in the Americas, further broadening the geographical spread of the disease [14]. The Aedes species of mosquito has been the major arthropod vector associated with CHIKV transmission to humans [15]. CHIKV infection usually leads to the development of CHIKF and is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia, and severe arthralgia. Similar to other arthralgia-causing arbovirus infections, a fraction of patients developed chronic symptoms lasting from several weeks to months [1], [2], [15].",

High levels of CHIKV-specific IgG antibody responses were detected at 16 dpi (Figure 1A) confirming previous observations [17]. Even though the IgG levels decreased over time, they were still detectable at 180 dpi (Figure 1A). To determine if the anti-CHIKV antibodies were neutralizing, in vitro infection of HEK 293T cells with different CHIKV isolates (IMT and SGP11) was carried out in the presence of sera from CHIKV-infected macaques (Figure 1B and 1C) [29]. Serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques contained antibodies that displayed neutralizing activity when assessed in sero-neutralization assays [16], [17] with the highest neutralizing efficiency for samples taken at 16 dpi (Figure 1C). Interestingly, a stronger neutralizing activity against IMT was observed when compared to SGP11 for samples at 16 dpi, at a dilution of 1\u2236800 (Figure 1C). This is not unexpected as these macaques were experimentally infected with the LR2006 OPY-1 isolate that is more closely related to the IMT isolate. The presence of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of CHIKV-infected macaques was sustained till 180 dpi, although less efficiently than sera at 16 dpi (Figure 1C).",

The serum contained antibodies against E2 glycoprotein and Capsid protein (Figure 2B and S1). Anti-E2 and anti-Capsid antibodies persisted till 180 dpi. In addition, CHIKV virions were purified from supernatant of cells infected with CHIKV isolates from Reunion Island (IMT) [25], or from Singapore (SGP11) [27]. Protein extracts were prepared under reducing or non-reducing conditions as described [29], [30], and were then assessed by immunoblot assays using serum samples from CHIKV-infected macaques (Figure 2C). This first screen revealed that these serum samples contained antibodies recognizing multiple proteins from two isolates of CHIKV. A stronger reactivity against proteins prepared under non-reducing conditions compared to proteins prepared under reducing conditions indicated that the serum samples contained antibodies recognizing both linear and disulfide bonds dependent conformational epitopes (Figure 2C) [35]. Similar reactivity was observed between two closely related CHIKV isolates (IMT and SGP11) that have more than 99% amino acid sequence similarity [36], suggesting that the two isolates present epitopes that are common or similar in part and are recognized by a fraction of the antibodies from macaques infected with the third closely related isolate of CHIKV.",

Anti-CHIKV antibody profiles were followed longitudinally through different post-infection phases (Figure 4). All the macaques presented with fever, rash and lymphopenia, and exhibited signs of inflammation as indicated by cytokine patterns and biochemistry assays, from 1 to 6\u20138 dpi [22]. The 9 dpi time point in the acute phase was the earliest time point when specific anti-CHIKV antibodies were detected (Figure 4). At 9 dpi, 90% of the total signal came from IgM that was no longer detectable at 16 dpi, in the early convalescent phase. Furthermore, at 16 dpi, the first detectable levels of IgG were also observed. Importantly, the later time-points of 100 and 180 dpi in the recovery phase allowed the plateau and persistence of the IgG specific response to be assessed, while levels of IgM were no longer detectable (data not shown). Next, to define the location of the linear B-cell epitopes, the complete set of single peptides from each of the antibody-binding peptide pools identified in Figure 3, was screened with serum samples. The positions of the epitope sequences within the non-structural and structural proteins are illustrated in the schematic diagrams (Figure 4A). The two recognized regions for the Capsid protein are located at the N- and C-terminus of the protein while the epitopes for the E2 glycoprotein are distributed along the entire protein. On the other hand, antibodies from the macaque serum samples failed to recognize any regions in the 6K protein and E1 glycoprotein. Comparison of the reactivity between the two time-points showed that antibodies recognized the linear epitopes in Capsid, and in the immunodominant E2 region in a concerted manner (Figure 4B).",

Results showed two structural proteins (Capsid protein and E2 glycoprotein) and three nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP3 and nsP4 proteins) contained linear epitopes that were recognized by macaque anti-CHIKV antibodies. Experimental infection of macaques induced antibodies not only against the structural proteins, but also against several non-structural proteins.

Specifically, high levels of antibodies from CHIKV-infected patients were targeted against a linear B-cell epitope called E2EP3 during the acute phase of CHIKV infection [17]. Here, E2EP3 is one of the major B-cell linear epitopes recognized by antibodies from the sera of all CHIKV-infected macaques during the early phase of disease (amino acids 2800\u20132818, Table 1). This verifies that the presence of anti-E2EP3 antibodies is a common marker for early CHIKV infection in both humans and macaques [17].

Moreover, the functional role of the ASR in regulating E1/E2 glycoprotein conformational changes suggests that the ASR could be a target for neutralizing antibodies [39]. Our previous results showed that natural CHIKV infection induced antibodies against only one ASR epitope (amino acids 3025\u20133058, Table 1). These antibodies were detected during the recovery phase (2 to 3 months post illness onset) [29]. However, anti-CHIKV antibodies against two ASR epitopes (amino acids 2961\u20132978, and 3025\u20133066, Table 1) were detected in the sera of experimentally infected macaques. Furthermore, these two ASR epitopes were immunodominant from the early convalescent to recovery phase, contrary to the immunodominance of the E2EP3 epitope observed in natural human CHIKV infection [17], [29]. The observation that one of the ASR epitopes (amino acids 3025\u20133058) is important in both natural human infection and experimental macaque infection, suggests that this epitope could be useful for vaccine development.",

This could be due to the spatial positions of the B-cell epitopes on the native form of the E1/E2 glycoprotein complex. Differential induction of neutralizing antibodies against exposed or hidden B-cell epitopes could contribute to antibody-mediated clearance during the entire course of disease [40]. This is important in CHIKV vaccinology since it underscores the importance of eliciting a broad antibody response targeting exposed and hidden B-cell epitopes that would be sufficient to cover most of the important antigens for virus neutralization.",

Here, we further demonstrated this phenomenon in the non-human primate model. Infection of macaques with the LR2006-OPY1 isolate, which encodes K252 in the E2 glycoprotein, strongly induced anti-CHIKV antibodies against a particular linear B-cell epitope (amino acids 3025\u20133066) at 16 dpi. In line with this, we observed significantly stronger neutralizing activity against the IMT isolate (encoding K252 in E2) compared to the SGP11 isolate (encoding Q252 in E2) (Figure 1C). These data complement a separate study that showed stronger neutralizing antibody response in animals infected with the ECSA strain (DHS-4263) compared to animals infected with the West African strain (37997) [24]. Paradoxically, the difference in neutralizing capacity observed here was lost in macaque sera taken at 180 dpi. Incidentally, sera taken at this time point also had relatively low levels of anti-CHIKV antibodies against the same B-cell epitope (amino acids 3025\u20133066). These observations highlight the importance of incorporating various components in antigen preparation for CHIKV vaccine development. Epitope sequences covering all the relevant isolates from various geographical regions will be favored in order to offer complete coverage against CHIKV infections globally.",

Recent studies have also demonstrated that CHIKV-infected patients reacted sero-positively to the E2 glycoprotein [17], [29], [41]. These observations were further supported by other studies with B-cell epitopes identified along the E2 glycoprotein by mouse and human monoclonal antibodies [21], [42]\u2013[44]. Contrastingly, linear epitopes along the E1 glycoprotein were detected only by antibodies from CHIKV-infected mice. Comparatively, antibodies obtained from experimentally-infected mouse models in other alphaviruses have also identified epitopes from both the E1 and E2 glycoproteins [18], [40], [45]\u2013[48].
