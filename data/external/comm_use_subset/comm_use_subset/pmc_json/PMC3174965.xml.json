Other symptoms reported during the pandemic included gastrointestinal complaints [12]\u2013[19], leukopenia [14], [20], [21], elevated aminotransferase levels [14], thrombocytopenia and other laboratory abnormalities [14], [20]\u2013[24].

Furthermore, these tests could not distinguish between different influenza A subtypes [31]. Seasonal influenza A (H1N1) was resistant to oseltamivir, whereas pH1N1 was not, making this a critical distinction [32]. While state public health labs had a CDC-based PCR assay for distinguishing influenza subtypes, an FDA-cleared product for clinical laboratories was delayed [33]. Therefore, many institutions, including our own, implemented a molecular-based test to diagnose influenza A [34].

Although more patients with pH1N1 presented with fever and sore throat compared to those with other viruses in our population, the difference was not enough to make a firm clinical diagnosis of influenza. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in cough alone between patients infected with pH1N1 and other respiratory viruses. However, fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms increased the likelihood of pH1N1 almost 10-fold in the pediatric population and may be useful as a preliminary guide to prompt clinicians to treat influenza infection. Chest radiographs may be useful in diagnosing superimposed bacterial infection. While airspace disease was observed more often in patients with non-influenza viruses, there were no chest radiographic findings that distinguish influenza infection. Over half of patients with pH1N1 had non-specific findings on chest radiograph as previously reported [24].",

A second limitation was the time period for which patients presenting with ILI were evaluated (6 weeks at the peak of the pandemic) whereas a typical respiratory season would be for several months and include a greater variety of viruses, especially in the pediatric population. In fact, our data (not shown) does indicate that after the pandemic wave at our institution, a typical peak for RSV, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses followed the presence of pH1N1, much like the rest of the country. A third limitation was that pH1N1 confirmatory testing was not performed for all non-subtypeable influenza A viruses. However, recent literature suggests that 100% of non-subtypeable influenza A H1 identified by the xTAG RVP was pH1N1 [39] and that misinterpretation is uncommon [40]. In addition, our initial investigation of a large number of strains early in the pandemic with the CDC PCR assay confirmed these findings. Many prior studies only assessed the clinical characteristics of patients with influenza or compared to individuals who's respiratory tests were negative for influenza, but they did not further delineate those without influenza or positive for another virus [14], [16], [18], [20], [21], [25], [26]. We set out to compare pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) to other respiratory viruses in patients with ILI. To our knowledge, these results provide the first comparison of clinical characteristics between pH1N1 and other common respiratory viruses.",

Respiratory infection with pH1N1 infection more often resulted in death compared to other respiratory viruses and should be treated aggressively with supportive measures and antiviral medications. Despite the use of RVP testing, many influenza-infected patients received antibacterial agents and many patients without influenza received antivirals. Use of a highly accurate RVP in conjunction with a robust antimicrobial stewardship program will be necessary to assure prudent antibacterial and antiviral agent use in the future.",

Our hospital system consists of Rhode Island Hospital, a tertiary care center licensed for 719 beds, including Hasbro Children's Hospital, as well as The Miriam, Newport and Bradley Hospitals licensed for 247, 129 and 60 beds, respectively. All respiratory specimens were processed in the microbiology facility at Rhode Island Hospital. Our 18-virus panel detected influenza A/B (H1, H3, and non-subtypeable A consistent with pH1N1), respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza 1,2,3,4 and coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E). The panel determined influenza A as seasonal human influenza A (H1N1), seasonal human influenza A (H3N2) or a non-subtypeable influenza A virus consistent with pH1N1. The Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the initial 30 specimens detected by the xTAG RVP as non-subtypeable influenza A H1 as pH1N1, utilizing primers and probes distributed by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Thus, subsequent non-subtypeable influenza A H1 detected by the RVP were reported as pH1N1.",

Subsequently, a series of multiple logistic regressions were constructed based on integrating the results from previous literature and our logistic regression results. Individual interactions between variables were checked and those with p>0.15 were retained, arriving at a final model. Special effort was placed on using symptoms and other clinical information.
