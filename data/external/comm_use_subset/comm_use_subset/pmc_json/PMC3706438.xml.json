High expression of IFITM3 has been detected in periphery leukocytes, HeLa cell lines, and other cells and tissues [13]\u2013[20]. IFITM3 participates in interferon-triggered processes, such as homotypic cell adhesion, anti-proliferative activities in tumor pathogenesis, and the innate immune response to virus infections [13]\u2013[19]. Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is produced and released in response to the presence of pathogens [21], it is secreted as a major cytokine to activate macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection [22]. Mutant mice lacking Ifng have weakened defense against M. tuberculosis\n[23], and genetic variations in IFNG and its receptor, IFNGR, have been implicated in susceptibility to human TB [24], [25]. IFITM3 has been proven to be an important component of IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway, as down-regulation of IFITM3 via siRNA could largely reduce the anti-virus activities conducted by IFN-\u03b3 [18]. Thus, IFITM3 is a potential candidate gene for TB susceptibility.",

In this regard, it is worth mentioning that Stein et al. previously found in a genome wide scan that one of the TB-linked loci was located in this chromosome region [26]. The core promoter region of human IFITM3 is enriched with regulatory elements (such as ISRE elements, the SP1-binding motif, and other regulatory sequences), and these are thought to be critical for its transcription [27]\u2013[30]. In this current study, we investigated the relationship between IFITM3 and susceptibility to TB via polymorphism analysis of its core promoter region around transcription start site. To determine whether or not these IFITM3 polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to TB, its alleles and genotypes were analyzed in case-control study in Han Chinese pediatric population.",

Previously, lysosome related genes, such as SLC11A1 (encoding solute carrier family 11 member 1, a lysosome membrane protein) [36] and IRGM (encoding immunity-related GTPase family M, mediating fusion of M. tuberculosis-contained endosome with lysosome) [37], were proven to be associated with TB susceptibility. Lysosomal pathway plays an important role in TB pathogenesis [36], [37], it may directly determine the successful elimination of M. tuberculosis by macrophages or the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages.
