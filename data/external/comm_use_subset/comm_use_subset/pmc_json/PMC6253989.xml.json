Unmodified Morpholinos have been used routinely to block translation, modify splicing, inhibit miRNA activity and inhibit viral replication as well as more exotic RNA-blocking applications [5]. The Morpholino antisense structural type has been a revolutionary tool in developmental biology [6]. Success in embryos came by microinjecting Morpholino oligos into eggs or single or few celled zygotes, so that during cell division the Morpholinos were apportioned into daughter cells. This neatly avoided the problem of delivering the antisense separately into each cell of a many-celled organism [7]. In addition to their use to determine gene functions and interactions in embryos, Morpholino antisense oligos have been used for research into a broad range of diseases as well as several clinical trials (AVI BioPharma, Inc.). In most cases, carrying work from research to therapeutic applications of unmodified Morpholino oligos has been limited by difficulties with in vivo delivery [8]. However, delivery of relatively high doses of unmodified Morpholinos into dystrophic muscle in animal models of DMD has induced expression of functional Dystrophin in skeletal muscle [9,10] and unmodified Morpholinos are currently in clinical trial for treatment of DMD (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00844597).",

The base and the morpholine nitrogen are protected and the subunit is activated with a dimethylamino phosphoro-dichloridate. The activated subunits are added to a synthesis resin with washing, deprotection and activation steps for each activated base added. Oligos are cleaved from the resin and deprotected with ammonium hydroxide, then purified and quantitated, often followed by lyophilization and sterilization [11]. Substitutions such as peptides or the dendrimer scaffold for guanidinium may be added to the 3\u2019 morpholine nitrogen while the oligo is still attached to the synthesis resin.

            "text": "Unmodified Morpholino oligos are endocytosed but have little to no activity against their RNA targets. Uptake by endocytosis does not mean the antisense oligos are reaching the cytoplasm or nucleus of the cell. Fluorescently-labeled Morpholinos can be detected as dim punctuate fluorescence within endosomes, but in most cells too little antisense escapes from the endosomes to the cytosol/nuclear compartment to be biologically active [2]. Morpholinos are not degraded in endosomes [12] but remain trapped. Many biological problems are best studied in adults and so a method that allows entry of antisense into most or all cells in an adult organism is very desirable. Ideally this systemic delivery could be accomplished by routine means such as intravenous or intraperitoneal injections. A technology that allows enough of the endocytosed oligos to escape from endosomes to have biological activity would enable in vivo delivery of oligos administered by systemic injection. Such technologies have now been developed: PPMOs and Vivo-Morpholinos. A PPMO may have an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide linked to either the 3\u2019 end or the 5\u2019 end of the Morpholino oligo [13]. The arginines have guanidinium moieties as part of their side chains, and the presence of these guanidiniums have been shown to increase cellular uptake of conjugated materials [14]. Studies of the mechanism of PPMO entry have shown that the cell-penetrating peptides offer two advantages over unmodified Morpholinos: enhanced uptake into endosomes and, critically, enhanced ensodomal escape [15]. A Vivo-Morpholino has an octaguanidinium dendrimer constructed on the 3\u2019 end of a Morpholino oligo [16] (Figure 1).",

These molecules are called peptide-linked phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomers, or PPMO for short. Research to develop more safe and effective peptide sequences for PPMOs has been the focus of Hong Moulton\u2019s group at AVI BioPharma Inc. [18,19], where preclinical work on PPMOs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is currently ongoing. Studies on PPMOs have shown that uptake of the oligos is an energy-dependant and temperature-dependant process that can be prevented using endocytosis inhibitors; these characteristics indicate that uptake of the PPMOs is by endocytosis [20]. A fraction of endocytosed PPMOs escape from the endosome, entering the cytosol and nuclear compartment where they can block mRNA translation and modify pre-mRNA splicing [21]. Intravenous injection [22], intraperitoneal injection or intranasal administration [23] of PPMOs to mice have inhibited viral replication. Injections of PPMOs into transgenic mice carrying engineered splice-reporter genes have triggered expression of green fluorescent protein throughout the tissues [24].",

The initiation complex moves along the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA until a start codon is reached. At the start codon, the large subunit of the ribosome docks to small ribosomal subunit and then the process begins of linking together amino acids to form the new protein. Morpholinos that block the journey of the ribosomal initiation complex from the 5\u2019-cap to the start codon, halting translation of the mRNA before the linking of amino acids can start. These Morpholinos can bind to RNA targets anywhere in the 5\u2019-UTR through the start of the coding region, so long as the oligo binds onto the start codon or upstream (to the 5\u2019 direction) of the start codon [34].",

This processing typically includes adding a 5\u2019 cap, splicing out introns and ligating together exons, and adding a 3\u2019 poly-A tail. Splice modification involves binding Morpholinos to targets on a pre-mRNA (an unspliced mRNA) to redirect the spliceosome to a new pattern of splicing and produce a mature mRNA sequence that differs from the sequence produced in the absence of the Morpholino. Usually Morpholinos are bound to mostly-intronic targets at the boundaries between exons and introns. These targets prevent the binding of molecules that direct the spliceosome to splice sites. Typical results of splice modification include removal of a targeted exon or inclusion of the first or last intron in the mature mRNA [35].",

Because of this, immunochemical techniques used to detect knockdowns by translation blocking Morpholinos often do not work when used for detecting activity of splice-modifying Morpholinos. The activity of splice-modifying oligos is typically assayed by RT-PCR from primers that bind on either side of the altered sequence. If the altered splice leaves downstream sequence in-frame, the RT-PCR product will appear at a different location on an electrophoretic gel. Activation of a cryptic splice site can result in an RT-PCR fragment of unexpected size [37]. If the altered splice shifts the downstream reading frame, appearance of a premature termination codon often results in nonsense-mediated decay of the modified RNA, so the wild-spliced RT-PCR product band might dim on the electrophoretic gel without the corresponding splice-modified RT-PCR product appearing as a new band in a different position.",

We will discuss miRNAs of animals; there are some differences in plants. The target RNA must have sites at least partially complementary to the miRNA. Usually (but not always [38]) the target sites for miRNAs are in the 3\u2019-UTR of mRNAs. miRNA is formed when a short stem-loop (hairpin) with the appropriate geometry forms in a newly-transcribed RNA. In the nucleus, the hairpin is recognized and cleaved by the Drosha nuclease, which cleaves both strands of the stem and leaves a few single-stranded overhanging bases. The resulting stem-loop is exported to the cytosol where it is recognized and cleaved by the Dicer nuclease, which removes the loop and also leaves a few single-stranded overhanging bases. The resulting short double-stranded RNA is loaded onto a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where a protein in the Argonaute family binds to one strand, called the guide strand, and cleaves the other strand. The cleaved strand dissociates and diffuses away, leaving an active miRNA-RISC complex [39].",

Morpholinos can bind to the immature RNA hairpin, preventing Drosha from releasing the stem-loop from the rest of the transcript. Morpholinos can bind to the stem-loop, preventing Dicer from cleaving the loop from the stem [41]. A typical strategy is to design a 25-base Morpholino to bind the entire guide strand sequence (around 21 bases) and slightly into the loop sequence, allowing both inhibition of mature miRNA activity on RISC and inhibition of miRNA maturation by blocking Dicer. Another option is protecting a mRNA target. By binding to its complementary miRNA, a Morpholino blocks RISC from accessing the mRNA, thus relieving translation of the mRNA from inhibition by the miRNA and protecting the mRNA from cleavage by miRNA-directed Argonaute activity [42]. An advantage of target protection is that only the expression of the target gene is altered, while inhibiting maturation and activity of a miRNA can alter the expression of many mRNAs.",

However, the delivery efficiency is highly variable within tissues and inefficient in some tissues including the heart and diaphragm muscles [9]. Vivo-Morpholinos improved delivery from blood into the cytosol and nuclei of dystrophic mice more than 50 fold compared with unmodified Morpholinos, which only entered muscle at all due to the leakiness characteristic of DMD muscle [28]. In addition, the antisense effects of Vivo-Morpholinos were achieved evenly and efficiently in body-wide tissues including heart, diaphragm and smooth muscle [28]. In healthy adult animals, iv treatment with unmodified Morpholino oligomers does not cause antisense activity in cells [27]. Recent studies have shown that Vivo-Morpholinos achieve delivery in a wide variety of tissues in normal adult mice while no detectable delivery of unmodified Morpholino was achieved at the same dosage [27].

Vivo-Morpholinos were tested in adult mice with intact cell membranes bearing a transgene with a mutation preventing the production of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). This error could be corrected by redirecting splicing with a Vivo-Morpholino oligo, resulting in the expression of EGFP. Recent studies demonstrated that Vivo-Morpholinos efficiently corrected the error in various tissues of the EGFP transgenic mice and showed no detectable toxicity [27]. In the mdx mouse model of DMD, Vivo-Morpholinos have shown potent antisense effects in body-wide muscles including the hard-to-deliver heart and diaphragm muscles [27, 28]. Vivo-Morpholinos have been tested by local injection in a DMD disease dog model in which they exhibit similar potency as when locally injected into mdx mice (Toshifumi Yokota, personal communication).",

            "text": "The antisense efficacy of Vivo-Morpholinos was demonstrated in several Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) disease animal models [27,28]. Recent data suggest that the efficacies of Vivo-Morpholinos and PPMOs are similar after local injections in dystrophic dogs (Toshifumi Yokota, personal communication). A Vivo-Morpholino targeting a splice site on the dystrophin mRNA restored Dystrophin protein production in mdx mice [27]. The efficiency of antisense effect was dosage dependent. Vivo-Morpholinos exhibit significantly higher impact on both splice-modified mRNA and protein levels at a dose of 25 mg/kg than at 12.5 mg/kg [27]. A single intravenous injection of 6 mg/kg Vivo-Morpholino spliced out the defect of the dystrophin gene in more than 50% of the skeletal muscle fibers of mdx mice [28]. Repeated injection of 6 mg/kg Vivo-Morpholinos into mdx mice biweekly over 10 weeks restored Dystrophin protein to near normal level in all skeletal muscles tested including biceps, diaphragm, intercostals, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and abdominal muscles. Significantly, these injections of Vivo-Morpholinos achieved cardiac delivery and enabled Dystrophin protein production in the heart [28]. Assays of blood markers for liver toxicity (AST,ALT) showed no change of liver function [27] and no significant impact on the body weight or the histology of the liver and kidney [28]. Importantly for potential therapeutic applications, multiple injections of Vivo-Morpholinos did not stimulate an adaptive immune response in mice as determined by ELISA against Vivo-Morpholinos using mouse serum [28]. The potent antisense effect in animals and lack of obvious toxicity at the effective dosage make Vivo-Morpholinos good research reagents for modifying gene expression. The therapeutic index and long term toxicity must be assessed because periodic administration of Vivo-Morpholinos is often required to maintain the antisense effect.",
