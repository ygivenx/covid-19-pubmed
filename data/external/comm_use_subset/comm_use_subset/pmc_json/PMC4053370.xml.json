The main risk factor of COPD is exposure to tobacco smoke which triggers a cascade of inflammatory pathways leading to disease induction in susceptible people. Major hallmarks of the disease pathology are the development of emphysema and chronic bronchitis that lead to a progressive and irreversible airflow limitation resulting in a continuous decline of lung function [1]. COPD severity has been associated with acute periods of disease worsening [2], [3], so-called exacerbations, a key factor in COPD morbidity and mortality [4], [5]. By causing acute respiratory distress, they impact on the quality of patient\u2019s health [6] and are responsible for most hospital stays related to the disease [4].",

            "text": "COPD exacerbations have been linked to excessive inflammatory responses, including enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells [15] and upregulation of a variety of proinflammatory mediators [16], [17]. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms and the most effective therapeutic strategies are still poorly understood and first-line therapy still predominantly relies on corticosteroids and bronchodilators [18], which are limited in their efficacy [17], [19]. Thus, the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to exacerbations is key for the identification of urgently required therapeutic targets. One of the proinflammatory cytokines that has been associated with COPD is IL-1\u03b2, a major player in initiation and persistence of inflammation. In animal models mimicking features of COPD, IL-1 has been shown to be key to the induction of emphysema and inflammation [20]\u2013[27]. Furthermore, its expression is significantly enhanced in COPD patients during acute episodes of exacerbations [17], [20], [28], [29]. Unraveling the role of IL-1\u03b2 in viral exacerbations might therefore not only result in an overall better understanding of mechanisms of exacerbations, but also indicate whether it qualifies as a valid therapeutic target. A promising candidate for therapeutic inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 signaling is one of its inhibitors, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra (Kineret, Amgen), which has been used effectively in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.",

We found that IL-1\u03b2 was a key driver of pulmonary inflammation, primarily concerning recruitment of neutrophils and lung dysfunction. IL-1\u03b2 driven neutrophilia was mediated by IL-17A in the initial phase of viral infection, but became independent of IL-17A during the peak phase of viral replication. Treatment with the IL-1Ra, anakinra, proved efficient in reducing neutrophilic inflammation at the peak of viral replication while blocking of IL-17A abrogated neutrophilia in the early phase of viral infection. Taken together our data indicate that blockade of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17A could be valid therapeutic approaches for treatment of virus-induced COPD exacerbations.",

LPS is a bacterial endotoxin present in tobacco smoke [35], [36], the predominant risk factor of COPD. It has been shown to cause inflammation, and particularly when co-administered with elastase, chronic emphysema-like changes develop in mouse lungs [34]. As such, we exposed mice once a week for 4 consecutive weeks to a mixture of 7 \u00b5g LPS and 1.2 U porcine pancreatic elastase via the intranasal route, as depicted in Figure 1A. By this we induced strong emphysema (Figure 1B,C) and sustained pulmonary inflammation (Figure 1B,D) in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. The development of emphysema was scored by increases in the mean linear intercept and the destructive index (Figure 1C) from lung histology. In addition, we observed a strong airway inflammation, mainly driven by neutrophils and lymphocytes (Figure 1D). Both, emphysema and inflammation, remained above baseline levels for at least 2 months (data not shown). Thus, the response induced by repeated challenges with LPS/elastase resembled the pathology of COPD. As the disease severity was more pronounced in the BALB/c strain (Figure 1B\u2013D), all experiments performed in wild type mice were conducted in BALB/c mice.",

Pulmonary resistance can be influenced by a variety of factors, of which the severity of inflammation is likely to play one of the key roles during exacerbations. In line with this we detected a strong inflammatory response upon infection with influenza virus associated with an augmented absolute number of cells infiltrating into the airways and the lung (Figure 2D). The cells were primarily neutrophils (Figure 2E, Figure S3A) and inflammatory monocytes (Figure 2F, Figure S4A). The peak of neutrophilic inflammation was reached at day 5 post infection and neutrophil numbers declined afterwards (Figure 2E, Figure S3A), directly correlating with the kinetics of viral replication (Figure 2B). In line with this we observed increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 peaking at day 3 or 5 post infection, respectively, and subsiding at day 7 after the infection (Figure 2G).",

C57BL/6 wild type mice exhibited a smaller change in pulmonary resistance in response to viral infection (Figure 3C) in comparison to BALB/c mice (Figure 2C), with a slight increase at day 1 post infection (Figure 3C). Nevertheless, pulmonary resistance in mice lacking IL-1\u03b2 was significantly reduced already after LPS/elastase exposure alone (Figure 3C), thus supporting the described role for IL-1\u03b2 in the development of chronic lung disease [20]\u2013[27]. Furthermore, pulmonary resistance in IL-1\u03b2-deficient mice was also completely unaffected by the viral challenge (Figure 3C). We did not detect any impact of IL-1\u03b2 on inflammatory monocytes (Figure S4B); however, we found a decreased frequency and number of neutrophils in non-infected IL-1\u03b2 deficient mice upon exposure to LPS/elastase (Figure 3D, Figure S3C). Similarly, the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways and lung following viral infection was also significantly abrogated in the absence of IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3D, Figure S3C). We observed significantly lower frequencies and absolute numbers of neutrophils including during the peak of neutrophil infiltration and viral replication at day 5 post infection (Figure 3D, Figure S3C).

            "text": "Considering its strong impact particularly upon neutrophils, we sought to address the mechanisms through which IL-1\u03b2 mediated this neutrophilic inflammation. Expression of the main neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were induced upon influenza infection, but were unaffected by IL-1\u03b2 (Figure S5). In addition we did not detect any influence of IL-1\u03b2 or the viral infection on the expression of G-CSF (Figure S5). Given there is substantial redundancy in neutrophil chemoattractants we thus next looked upstream at the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1, which can all stimulate neutrophilic inflammation by inducing chemotactic, growth or survival factors [16], [39], [40]. As expression of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 were induced in our mouse model upon influenza infection (Figure 2G), we hypothesized that IL-1\u03b2 drove the observed inflammation by altering their production. The peak expression of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 upon influenza infection was reached faster in C57BL/6 wild type mice at day 1 post infection (Figure 2G) as compared to day 3 in BALB/c mice (Figure 3E), and thus coincided with the earlier response in pulmonary resistance observed in the C57BL/6 strain (Figure 3C). IL-6 protein levels followed similar kinetics in both mouse strains (Figure S6A,B), while TNF\u03b1 protein production was below the sensitivity limit of our assay. However, lack of IL-1\u03b2 did not impair the expression and production of IL-6 (Figure 3E, Figure S6B) and in fact increased the expression of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 3E). We therefore focused on IL-17A, a proinflammatory cytokine that has been shown to be elevated in COPD patients [41], [42] and whose induction partially depends on IL-1\u03b2 [43]\u2013[45]. We found significantly reduced expression levels of IL-17A in lung homogenate in the absence of IL-1\u03b2, in both non-infected as well as influenza-infected LPS/elastase exposed mice (Figure 3F). IL-17A production was significantly reduced in the predominant cellular sources of IL-17A, such as the CD4+ T cells and the \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in IL-1\u03b2 deficient mice (Figure 3G). Further sources of IL-17A such as CD3+ CD4\u2212 CD8\u2212 \u03b3\u03b4TCR\u2212 cells that might comprise NKT cells, and CD3\u2212 cells also showed reduced levels of IL-17A in the absence of IL-1\u03b2 (Figure S7A). However, even in the wild type animals these cells represented a very minor population of cells relative to the IL-17A-producing T cells (Figure S7A). Taken together our data showed that in addition to contributing to lung dysfunction, IL-1\u03b2 played a key role in driving neutrophilic inflammation during influenza-induced exacerbations, an effect that was tightly linked to IL-17A expression.",

Neutralization assays were performed in BALB/c mice, which exhibited a similar induction of IL-17A as C57BL/6 mice (Figure S7B). Mice received either an IL-17A neutralizing antibody or an isotype control antibody one day before and two days after the viral infection (Figure 4A). IL-17A neutralization did not impact on the control of viral replication, as viral burden was comparable to the isotype control treated animals (Figure 4B). We found that influenza-induced neutrophil recruitment to the airways and lung was indeed entirely attenuated 24 h after the infection in absence of IL-17A (Figure 4C, Figure S3D). However, neutrophils infiltrated into the lung and airways during the later stages of infection (day 3 and 5 respectively) to finally reach the same frequencies as in mice treated with the isotype control (Figure 4C, Figure S3D); thus indicating that IL-17A was only required for the initial but not for the later recruitment of neutrophils. Hence, IL-1\u03b2 driven neutrophilia during influenza infection of LPS/elastase exposed mice was mediated by IL-17A in the early phase of infection, but became independent of IL-17A.",

Accordingly, recombinant IL-1Ra (Anakinra) or PBS was administered twice daily, starting two days prior to the viral infection (Figure 5A). Mice receiving Anakinra displayed an impaired early control of viral infection leading to a higher viral burden at day 3 post infection, although viral titers rapidly declined afterwards to levels similar to non-treated mice at day 7 post infection (Figure 5B), and virus was completely cleared at day 9 post infection (data not shown). Treatment with Anakinra was efficient in reducing neutrophil frequencies and numbers in the airways at day 5 post infection, the peak of neutrophilic infiltration and viral replication (Figure 5C, Figure S3E). We did not observe an effect of Anakinra on the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes (Figure S4C). Similarly, we did not detect significant changes in lung function upon the treatment with Anakinra (data not shown).",

As there is a clear need to understand the mechanisms driving exacerbations and responsiveness to therapy, we examined viral-induced exacerbations in mice. In our model (Figure 2A), mice developed a strong inflammatory response characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate into the airways and lung (Figure 2E), enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 (Figure 2G), and impairment in lung function (Figure 2C). Decline in lung function and neutrophil accumulation are characteristic of exacerbations in humans [48]\u2013[50], and elevated levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 have similarly been measured in the sputum of patients undergoing an exacerbation [17], [51].

Building upon these studies we found that during influenza-induced exacerbations, pulmonary accumulation of neutrophils was also driven by IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3D, Figure S3C). Our data is in line with results from a study of Botelho et al. [20] who investigated IL-1 in a mouse model of acute cigarette smoke exposure. They found that interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) deficiency led to a reduction of neutrophils following infection with influenza and that this effect was independent of IL-1\u03b1. One could therefore speculate that IL-1\u03b2 may play a critical role in neutrophil recruitment in their model as well.",

In line with this, we found that IL-17A mediated early inflammation in our model of influenza-induced exacerbations of chronic lung disease (Figure 4C). Our data showed that IL-1\u03b2 driven neutrophil recruitment during the first 24 h of infection was mediated by lL-17A, while it became independent of IL-17A at later time points during the exacerbation. We found that in the absence of IL-1\u03b2 the expression of IL-17A was completely abrogated upon LPS/elastase exposure as well as during exacerbations (Figure 3F), thus demonstrating that IL-1\u03b2 is required for the induction of IL-17A. IL-17A expression was induced by LPS/elastase exposure alone, and levels were maintained throughout the viral-induced exacerbation (Figure 3F,G); however, while IL-1\u03b2 levels increased during the later phase of infection (Figure 3A), IL-17A expression surprisingly remained unaltered and even decreased at the peak of viral replication (Figure 3F). Nevertheless, we could block the recruitment of neutrophils at early time points following the influenza infection by neutralizing IL-17A (Figure 4C). During the peak of viral replication, and thus a more severe state of inflammation, IL-17A neutralization could not prevent neutrophil influx. This might be due to an induction of cytokines during the progression of the infection, which could overcome the effect of IL-17A. Therefore, treatment with anti-IL-17A seems to be favorable in the early phases of exacerbations while blocking IL-1\u03b2 might be more advantageous during the ongoing infection. Whether these findings translate into a clinical setting remains to be investigated.",

Current treatment relies mainly on corticosteroids and bronchodilators that have been shown to reduce the frequency of exacerbations [55]\u2013[57], but have no positive effect on an ongoing episode of exacerbation. Indeed, no reduction in the inflammatory response including neutrophil influx in mice and cytokine expression in humans could be achieved by treatment with steroids during COPD exacerbations [17], [19]. In contrast, corticosteroids have been shown to actually support neutrophil survival [58], [59]. Moreover, treatment with corticosteroids, efficient in reducing IL-1\u03b2 levels in stable COPD, did not affect the amount of IL-1\u03b2 protein in exhaled breath condensate during exacerbations [17]. As blocking of either IL-17A (Figure 4C) or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3D, Figure S3C) efficiently reduced neutrophilic inflammation during viral exacerbation, these two molecules could be considered potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Given the redundancies in these two inflammatory pathways, a combination therapy of anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-1\u03b2 may prove more beneficial in improving lung function.",

            "text": "Within the context of targeting IL-17A or IL-1\u03b2 in the clinic, one has to keep in mind that altering proinflammatory immune responses harbors the risk of interfering with the control of acute infection and of susceptibility to opportunistic infections. To shorten the duration of intervention and thereby reducing the risk of prolonged or secondary infections, we treated mice directly before and during the viral infection with anti-IL-17A (Figure 4A) or IL-1Ra (Figure 5A). This was sufficient to abrogate neutrophil recruitment at the indicated time points. Furthermore, neutralizing IL-17A did not promote elevated viral replication (Figure 4B). Treatment with IL-1Ra, and thereby blocking both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, led to increased viral titers in the initial phase of infection (Figure 5B), whereas the absence of IL-1\u03b2 alone did not affect viral replication (Figure 3B). It is therefore likely that in our model the initial control of the virus might be mediated rather by IL-1\u03b1 than by IL-1\u03b2. This is in line with data from Botelho et al. [20], who found similarly elevated viral titers upon neutralization of IL1-\u03b1 as in the complete absence of IL-1R. Our data thus suggest that targeting specifically IL-1\u03b2, and not its receptor, would be favorable in a therapeutic application. However, as treatment with Anakinra did not interfere with final viral clearance it still could be considered as a therapeutic approach with the additional advantage of already being used in the clinic for other indications.",
