            "text": "A pandemic occurs when a new viral strain appears, against which the human population has no immunity, resulting in epidemics worldwide with high mortality and morbidity. It is estimated that the influenza pandemic that started with the 1918 Spanish flu killed ~20 to 50 million people worldwide [1], followed by epidemics of Asian flu in 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968 and Russian flu in 1977, each with random severe attacks on human populations [2]. A recent strain of influenza, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, and its variants have been in circulation since the first major outbreak in 1997 among birds in South East Asia leading to 141 human deaths [3]. High mutation rate and wide variety of birds and mammals including human hosts are probable reasons of pandemic-causing ability of the virus. Previous studies on the pathogenicity of influenza virus have reported the role of different kinds of genetic events like antigenic shift, antigenic drift, recombination and reassortment as major reasons for the emergence of virulent strains [4-10]. The very recent outbreak of swine influenza (H1N1) in Mexico in April/May 2009 has already prompted the WHO raise an alarm at the situation by raising the level of influenza pandemic alert to phase 6 [11]; the H1N1 swine flu is believed to be a product of reassortment between genes in the avian, human and swine influenza strains which has exhibited capability for human to human transmission and resulted in at least 8768 human deaths worldwide at last count [11].",

            "text": "According to the latest WHO report (from 2003 to 27th November 2009), 262 out of 444 H5N1 flu infected human patients have died [12]. Although there is no confirmed evidence of human to human transmission, WHO still considers the H5N1 to be a potential pandemic threat [12]. The only known and effective inhibitors developed to date to control the spread of this virus are targeted against either the M protein (amantadine, rimantadine) or NA (oseltamivir (marketed as Tamiflu), zanamivir (marketed as Relenza)). Amantadine and rimantadine resistance has developed in almost all circulating influenza strains [13] and therefore only oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently being stockpiled as precaution against any pandemic [12]. However, though these drugs are effective against the NA active site, recent strains from localized areas [Northern Hemisphere (2007-08 season), Southern Hemisphere (2008 season) and finally 100% resistant in United States (2009 pandemic strains)] have developed resistance against oseltamivir [14]. Oseltamivir treatment showed resistance in up to 2% patients in clinical trials and 18% of treated children including frequent resistance acquisition in case of children only [15,16]. A few Tamiflu resistant cases were also reported in laboratory experiments [14,17], where the mutation of H274Y is believed to be partly responsible [18]. Additionally, in case of zanamivir, markedly reduced effectiveness (2.3% of collected sample) was observed in influenza-A (H1N1) viruses isolated between 2006 to early 2008 from Australia & Southeast Asia containing previously undescribed Q136K NA mutation [19]. Thus, the high rate of mutation in the viral sequences has always posed a risk of rapid development of resistance against current inhibitors and vaccines. Detection of any strongly conserved region within the overall mutational scenario remains therefore an important point of focus for designing effective remedies covering broad spectrum antiviral activity.",

            "text": "In a previous analysis [20] using graphical representation methods, we had reported a specific stretch in the 3' C-terminal end of the RNA sequence that seemed to be well conserved. Graphical representation techniques were developed by Hamori and Ruskin [21], Gates [22], Nandy [23] and Leong and Morgenthaler [24], among others [25] and have been applied to a wide variety of problems highlighting their usefulness. Liao et al [26] have shown that such techniques can be used to analyse the SARS corona virus, and, separately [27], to generate phylogenetic trees without any need for multiple alignments, Larionov et. al. [28] have shown that plots of human and mouse chromosomal sequences in a graphical representation were able to reveal long range palindromes. Randic, Humberto Gonzales-Diaz and several other authors have extended these techniques to protein sequence analysis and obtained many useful results. Parameters like numerical indices, topological indices are the recent outcome of these techniques applied to proteins, viral surfaces, RNA secondary structures and small molecules [29-34] have extended the scope to consider more general biological applications. In particular, Gonz\u00e1lez-D\u00edaz et al. extended these representations to the study of protein sequences [35] and Mass Spectra outcomes of proteins and/or protein serum profiles in parasites [36], Toxicoproteomics and diagnosis of Cancer patients [37,38]. Also, these descriptors can be used in QSAR studies of biological entity in molecular level. These QSAR connect structural information with the biological function of a molecular entity under study and may be used to predict unknown entries. Structure here refers not only to drug structure but also to DNA sequence, RNA sequence or secondary structure, and protein sequences or 3D structure [38]. Analyses based on graphical representation techniques have thus become acceptable for many purposes [39].",

Basically there are two approaches for numerical characterization, both of which use the graphical representation to map a DNA sequence into a set of numbers. One approach using geometrical mapping proposed by Raychaudhury and Nandy [41] have been found to be useful for several calculations based on the 2D graphical representation [25], and extended recently to an abstract 20D modelling for protein sequences [40], where individual sequences are indexed by numerical descriptors. The other approach is to use matrix methods by forming ratios of graph theoretic and Euclidean distances between nodes of the graphical plots, first formulated for DNA sequences in Randic et al [42]. Since invariants associated with matrix formulation are well-known, individual sequences can be indexed by one or more such invariants of various orders; it is expected that these would be sufficiently characteristic of the underlying sequences to enable unique characterization. This technique has been the most widely used method of choice for the researchers in this field who have defined different types of matrices to construct various invariants to describe the DNA sequences. However, the difficulties associated with computing various parameters for very large matrices that are natural for large sequences have restricted the numerical characterizations to leading eigenvalues and the like [25].",

The body segment also holds the active site where sialidase activity takes place, while the C-terminal end of a membrane protein is also very important since it's generally responsible for holding information of protein transport [43], folding stabilization [44], cell to cell migration specificity [45] and others. One related example is the C-terminal of ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel: The 100 amino acids situated at C-terminal of RyR, referred to as the C-terminal tail, is a highly conserved sequence throughout RyR isoforms and which has been implicated in channel function where deletion of final 15 residues results in an inactive channel [46]. Additionally Goto et al. [47] have shown the importance of carboxy-terminal lysine (position 453) of NA in plasminogen mediated hemagglutinin cleavage. Li et al has shown from the DNA sequences that truncation of 66 nucleotides at the 3'-terminal (or C-terminal 22 amino acids) of the NA leads to loss of antigenicity against influenza virus in BALB/c mice [48], indicating a crucial role of that region as a potent antigen. Additionally, we have modelled the RNA secondary structure of this region and determined that a double loop hairpin formation exists in a majority of the sequences. All these evidences support the importance of C-terminal region as a functional and antigenically important portion for the NA proteins.",

For easy computation and comparison we have calculated weighted averages and resultant vectors that are unique to the respective sequences as in the case of the nucleotide sequence representations [40]. Here this technique is used to compute the protein descriptors to determine similarity/dissimilarity between different protein sequences including short protein stretches. To avoid error of false similarity when analysing short sequences, we have added a stretch of 20 aa peptides at the beginning of each sequence for filling up all the initial coordinates with the value 1 before starting the calculation of protein descriptors, a technique that is useful for comparative studies.",

This was then extended to 12-residue, 16-residue and 24-residue blocks, based on which the 16-residue block was found to yield optimum results. (b) A second consideration was that while a short aa segment may show a high probability of being solvent exposed, a comparatively large segment will have considerable portions embedded in the protein. (c) A large segment will have considerable variability in the amino acid composition. Indeed, based on these considerations, the GSWM identified the 16 aa segment as the optimum and this can be seen in the figures (Figure 3) and the accompanying animated sequence [Additional file 1] where it will be observed that all but one of the six 16-aa blocks show only portions as surface exposed.",

Next, we did a sliding window analysis along the NA body region to determine whether any other segment had comparable characteristics. Finally, we did a solvent accessibility analysis of the protein. From correlation of the results obtained from solvent accessibility analysis and sliding window method we could determine that the terminal segment was the best surface exposed conserved 16 amino acids long stretch which may be involved in significant biological functions; this is especially significant in view of the observation that truncation of the last 22 aa leads to loss of biological function of NA [48].

Numerical characterization of the 514 NA RNA database have already summarized the database to 25 strains generating 25 unique numbers each representing unique structure of the 50 base RNA segment. Using these strains in RNA secondary structure prediction through mfold have yielded a double hairpin structure (Figure 1) in 21 cases with acceptable \u0394G values showing strong stability characteristics. This kind of double hairpin structures are found to contribute in some biological functions like V(D)J recombination [60], RNA editing [61] and viral RNA encapsidation [62].

Assuming that solvent accessibility may be indicative of accessibility of the site to potentially interacting portion of molecules, we next determined the solvent accessibility at each position of the sequence using SABLE secondary structure prediction server.

A reasonably good correlation, 0.49 at 0.01 significance level, can be seen between the variability of the N1 strain protein sequences and solvent accessibility within the body region, though sequences included in stalk and transmembrane region do not show such a good correlation. We notice that regions of high solvent accessibility have high variability of the residues. This indicates that regions of the protein that are not accessible to the outside are more restricted in their mutations, whereas segments that are more easily accessible to outside influences can accommodate a greater degree of change implying that the interior of the protein is more stable, perhaps for structural reasons. This analysis shows that whatever individual hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties each residue may have, the co-operative effect of a stretch of peptides is quite important.",

In this segment, as can be seen from Figure 2, while the protein sequence variability is seen to decline, the solvent accessibility factor is seen to increase. Thus as we come closer to the last 16 residues, we find that this stretch is considerably solvent accessible, while at the same time being highly conserved. To understand this apparent divergence, we studied the crystallographic evidence of the structure of this region. Figure 3 and Additional file 1 show that this 16-residue C-terminal region of the protein sequence resides on the surface of the quaternary structure and appears to participate in the binding of one subunit of the quaternary structure to the next. It is therefore not surprising that this segment of the protein is quite well conserved for its structural stability, and it is at the same time accessible to the outside. According to recent structural biology research, a stretch of conserved surface residues or regions of a solvent accessible protein can be of significant biological importance in terms of enabling protein-protein binding [63], allosteric regulation [64], oligomerization [65], signal peptides activity [43] etc. Thus any molecule that targets this conserved surface stretch can interfere with the protein's normal biological activity leading to the protein's malfunction. Recent pharmaceutical research frequently uses allosteric modulator [66] for designing drug molecules without side effects and toxic effects. In contrast, as can be seen from Additional file 1, the other five regions that would appear from Figure 2 to be highly conserved have a majority of the sequence in the interior of the protein and thus not as accessible to the environment. Here we propose that the conserved 16 aa region at the C-terminal end as determined by our analyses can be targeted to explore it's biological importance and consequent development of inhibitory molecules targeting this section for efficient control of viral infection.",

This can be attributed to its possible role as a stitching agent for the stability of its tetrameric structure; while the gene sequence undergoes several mutations, these are mostly synonymous permitting very little variance in the amino acid composition implying that the asynonymous mutations must be eliminated due to functional requirements. Also, protein-protein interactions in such regions are known to lead to functional instability through realignment of the docking region. Comparisons with the solvent accessibility profile and 3D structure have shown that a major part of this stretch of the protein sequence is surface situated. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that this segment is important for the stability of the NA protein and any destabilization initiated through it could lead to neutralization of the NA's effectiveness as an agent for the proliferation of the influenza virions in vivo.",
