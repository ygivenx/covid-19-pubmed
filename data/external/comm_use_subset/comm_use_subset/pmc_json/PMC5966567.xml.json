            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most important cause of viral encephalitis in Southeast Asia, with 30,000\u201350,000 cases reported annually (Hegde and Gore, 2017). JEV is transmitted in a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes and vertebrate-amplifying hosts, mainly swine and wading birds (Mansfield et al., 2017). As a member of the Flavivirus genus, the JEV virion is enveloped and has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. The initial steps of JEV infection include virus attachment to cell-surface receptors and entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Translation of the viral genome produces a polyprotein that is processed to structural core (C), precursor of membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins and the nonstructural proteins NS1~NS5. Flaviviral genome replication occurs by the viral replicase complex via RNA-dependent RNA polymerization. The positive-sense genomic RNA is transcribed to a replication-intermediate negative-sense RNA, which is then used as a template to synthesize genomic RNA for subsequent translation and assembly of virion progeny (Tiroumourougane et al., 2002; Fields et al., 2007).",

            "text": "How a virus triggers DNA damage signaling is not fully understood, but previous reports have suggested that the cellular DNA repair machinery can recognize viral genetic materials, such as replicating nucleic acids and viral proteins, upon infection (Weitzman et al., 2004). Some viruses have been shown to interact with and/or affect components of the ATM DNA damage pathway (Lilley et al., 2007; Bagga and Bouchard, 2014). DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV) activate the ATM checkpoint pathway during DNA replication and inhibit DNA damage responses by mislocalizing checkpoint proteins from the nucleus to cytoplasm (Gaspar and Shenk, 2006). Herpes simplex virus (HSV) induces an ATM-damage response that is essential for viral replication (Lilley et al., 2005; Shirata et al., 2005). Inhibition of CHK2 kinase activity by the CHK2 inhibitor II significantly reduces the CPE and genome replication of HSV-1 in corneal epithelium (Alekseev et al., 2015). Hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus belonging to Flaviviridae, induces G2/M phase arrest (Wu et al., 2008) and activates the dsDNA damage response pathway by causing DSBs and enhancing the mutation of cellular genes (Machida et al., 2004). Knockdown of ATM or CHK2 suppresses RNA replication of HCV (Ariumi et al., 2008), and HCV NS3-NS4A interacts with ATM, whereas HCV NS5B interacts with both ATM and CHK2 (Lai et al., 2008). JEV is able to manipulate the cell cycle, which reduces the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (Das and Basu, 2008) and allows for persistent infection (Kim et al., 2015). JEV is also able to manipulate the cell cycle, which reduces the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (Das and Basu, 2008) and allows for persistent infection (Kim et al., 2015).",

The VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus set that carries these shRNAs knocked down 1260 genes encoding kinase/phosphatases, which accounts for ~90% of all kinase/phosphatase in accordance of the NCBI database. After selection with puromycin for lentivirus-transduced cells, cells were infected JEV at an MOI of 10 (Figure 1A). Surviving cell colonies were cultured to extract genomic DNA. DNAs encoding shRNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced to determine their targets by BLAST alignment with the NCBI database to further confirm the identities of these genes as kinase/phosphatase encoding genes. Seven host candidate genes (Figure 1B), were identified in cells survived from JEV challenge.",

U87 cells showed reduced expression of CHK2 by transduction with lentivirus expressing an shRNA targeting CHK2 (Figure 2A). Upon JEV infection, knockdown of CHK2 resulted in reduced CPE (Figure 2B), enhanced cell survival (Figure 2C) and reduced JEV progeny production (Figure 2D) as compared with control knockdown shLacZ cells. To ascertain the importance of CHK2 in JEV infection, we further checked the involvement of CHK2 in another human cell line, A549 cells.

U87 cells were infected with JEV (MOI 0.1 and 5) in the absence or presence of non-cytotoxic CHK2 inhibitor II (25 and 50 \u03bcM). Immunoblotting analysis with anti-CHK2 (Thr68) antibody showed that CHK2 inhibitor II effectively reduced the JEV induced phosphorylation of CHK2 protein (Figure 5A). CHK2 inhibitor II also reduced virus production. With low MOI, 25 \u03bcM CHK2 inhibitor II readily decreased JEV production by ~100-fold (Figure 5B). With high MOI, 25 \u03bcM CHK2 inhibitor II slightly suppressed JEV production, whereas 50 \u03bcM conferred 94% reduction in virus production. With the treatment of 50 \u03bcM CHK2 inhibitor II, virus progeny was inhibited in both high MOI (Figure 5C) and low MOI (Figure 5D) at various time points. The antiviral effect of the CHK2 inhibitor II was further verified in A549 cells and BE(2)C cells. CHK 2 inhibitor II reduced both the viral protein expression and CHK2 phosphorylation level (Figure 6A) Viral progeny production (Figure 6B) was suppressed by CHK2 inhibitor II at different time points (Figures 6C, D). Similar to U87, the CHK2 phosphorylation of BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells was induced by JEV and reduced by CHK2 inhibitor II (Figure 7A). The virus progeny in both high MOI (Figure 7B) and low MOI (Figure 7C) was inhibited by 50 \u03bcM CHK2 inhibitor II in various time points.

HSV-1 and SV40 recruit members of the ATM DNA damage pathway to specific sites in the nucleus during replication (Taylor and Knipe, 2004; Wilkinson and Weller, 2004; Zhao et al., 2008). Furthermore, the NS5B of HCV was found to interact with both ATM and CHK2, and the replication of subgenomic replicon RNA of HCV was suppressed in cells with CHK2 knockdown (Ariumi et al., 2008). In this study, we also found that downregulation of CHK2 and inhibition of CHK activity enhanced cell resistance to JEV infection. Likewise, progeny virus production and expression of viral proteins were reduced in cells with knockdown of functional CHK2. Because viral replication induces cellular stresses and triggers an ATR response, viruses may hijack CHK2 to elongate the cell cycle arrest, thus creating a time window for viral replication. Consequently, downregulation of CHK2 becomes a suitable way to inhibit virus propagation.",

In analogy to some RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (He et al., 2010), mouse hepatitis virus (Chen and Makino, 2004), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Yuan et al., 2007), JEV infection is able to regulate cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase, probably resulting from CHK2 activation (Lavin and Kozlov, 2007). Upon activation, CHK2 phosphorylates Cdc25a and Cdc25c (phosphatases), which results in G1/S or G2/M arrest via degradation or cytoplasmic sequestration, respectively (Antoni et al., 2007). Each phase of the cell cycle should represent a unique metabolic status. Indeed, the transcription activity of Pol II is much higher in the G1 phase than in the S or G2/M phase (Yonaha et al., 1995). As well, in non-dividing hepatocytes, the G0/G1 state has higher translation efficiency, which facilitates expression of the HCV genome (Fehr et al., 2012). Likewise, to proliferate the viral genome, JEV may arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase to increase Pol II transcription activity and translation efficiency. Moreover, oncogenic viruses often possess mechanisms to induce G1/S cell cycle arrest via p53 inactivation, thus rescuing the infected cells from apoptosis (Yew and Berk, 1992; Scheffner et al., 1993; H\u00e4rtl et al., 2008). JEV inducing G1 arrest may be advantageous to gain sufficient time and resources for viral replication and to avoid early apoptosis of infected cells.",
