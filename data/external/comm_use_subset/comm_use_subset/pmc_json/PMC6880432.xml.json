            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious disease that causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, electrolyte imbalance, and dehydration in piglets [1]. The morbidity and mortality rates are highly correlated with the age and the immune status of susceptible piglets [2]. The causative agent of PED is a single stranded, enveloped RNA virus named porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the genera Alphacoronavirus, the family Coronaviridae, and the order Nidovirales [3]. The PEDV has an approximately 28-kilobase pair genome, including seven open reading frames, and encodes both non-structural and structural proteins [4]. The four major structural proteins are envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) [1, 2]. The N protein produced during the early infection stages is the most abundant protein throughout the entire viral propagation process [5, 6]. The M protein is anchored on the envelope of the virion, which is formed by a small amount of E protein [7], whereas the S protein protrudes in homologous trimer and shapes crown-like projections on the viral surface [8]. Among these structural proteins, the S protein, a superficial glycoprotein, is responsible for establishing infection and inducing neutralizing antibodies [9, 10]. The S protein can be divided into the S1 region (amino acid [aa] 1\u2013789) and S2 region (aa 790\u20131383) [11]. Generally, the S1 region, which can be further subdivided into five structural domains (S10, S1A, S1B, S1C, and S1D), dominates the viral-host recognition and receptor binding, whereas the S2 region triggers viral fusion and internalization [9, 12]. Additionally, three neutralizing epitopes on the spike protein of PEDV have been reported: including CO-26 K equivalent epitope (COE epitope; aa 499\u2013638) [13], S1D epitope (aa 636\u2013789) [14], and 2C10 epitope (aa 1368\u20131374) [15]. Recently, the S10, S1A, and S1B domains, as well as the C-terminus of S2, were demonstrated to participate in virus neutralization [8, 16, 17]. The functions and the importance of the S protein of PEDV make it a key target for vaccine development and immune status evaluation.",

Recently, genotype 2 (G2) PEDV, which has a high virulence, was found to affect Asia and America, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industries, especially in China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, US, Canada, and Mexico [1, 3]. The mortality rate in seronegative neonatal piglets after high virulent PED infections reached 90\u201395% [19\u201321]. Currently, the disease is still circulating in several countries, therefore, evaluating the PEDV-specific immune response of piglets and sows is essential. This evaluation will allow us to determine the efficacy of immunization and to predict the trend of immune status in the field to create strategies for the prevention and control of PED.",

Commercially available ELISA kits for PEDV are mainly based on the N protein of PEDV, because N protein is the dominant protein. It is massively produced during the infection procedure and is able to provoke strong immune responses [24]. However, previous studies have revealed that whole virus, N protein, or M protein-based ELISA may detect cross-reactive antibodies against other swine coronaviruses [25]. On the other hand, several PEDV S-based ELISAs have been developed [26\u201328] and confirmed no cross-reactivity with other porcine coronaviruses [26, 28]. These results suggest that S-based ELISA may be more suitable for detecting PEDV-specific antibodies.",

The precise folding and appropriate modifications of the target antigens are key for both vaccine and serological assay development. To date, only one G2b S1 (aa 1\u2013781)-based ELISA has been developed from a mammalian protein expression system [26]. We earlier applied human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell derived PEDV-Pintung 52 (PT) trimeric full-length S protein-based ELISA for the detection of antibodies against homologous strains [31, 32]. However, the differences in performance between the trimeric full-length S-based PEDV ELISA, that contains all epitopes spanning the complete viral S protein, and the truncated S-based PEDV ELISA, that contains partial epitopes of the S protein, in the detection of antibodies against heterologous and historic PEDV strains is unknown.",

In this study, a HEK-293 mammalian expression system was used to express the coating antigens, S proteins, for the development of PEDV ELISAs. The S protein of PEDV is a key target for virus neutralization and vaccine development [1, 4] and contains several neutralizing epitopes [8, 13, 15\u201317], which may be an important indicator for evaluating immunity against PEDV [1]. The S protein of coronavirus has been demonstrated to display a complex structure and contains at least 21\u201335 predicted N-glycosylation sites. The mammalian protein expression system allows for proper formation of complex multidimensional structures and post-translational modifications, thereby generating antigens that can attain a high sensitivity in ELISAs [12, 34, 35]. The S protein of PEDV is a trimeric protein [36] and, similar to other coronaviruses, the trimeric form of the S protein may contain more conformational epitopes than a monomeric protein [37]. Therefore, the full length of the trimeric spike protein containing all S1 and S2 epitopes is considered an important target for the development of ELISAs [8, 13\u201316]. However, the large molecular size of the full-length S protein presents a challenge for large scale protein expression and production [32]. With these difficulties, many studies have preferred to use S1 instead of full-length S to conduct both vaccine and serological assay development [28, 31, 38]. The high sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA developed using the S1 protein of PEDV produced by Freestyle 293-F cells [26] suggests that truncated S proteins might also be good candidates for developing PEDV S-based ELISA. However, the performance of the S1-based ELISA has never been compared with the full-length PEDV S-based ELISA. Based on the comparison of the protein yields of different truncated S protein-expressing stable HEK-293 cells, the S1\u2013501-based ELISA was successfully developed. Interestingly, the full-length S-based ELISA was not superior in terms of its ability to detect PEDV-specific antibodies compared with the truncated S1\u2013501-based ELISAs. In the present study, the S1\u2013501 protein was prepared from the supernatant of a stable cell line to reduce the expenses for transfection and expression. Furthermore, the S1\u2013501 expressing stable cell line was selected based on its superior protein expression quantity (40 \u03bcg/mL culture supernatant) to others. For ELISA application, approximately 20 \u03bcg of S protein was used for preparing a 96-well plate ELISA. These suggest that each mL of culture supernatant could be used to prepare two ELISA plates. The excellent performance of the truncated S1\u2013501-based ELISA with the highest protein expression level indicates this would be a good antigen and for PEDV ELISA. Our findings are similar to those of previous reports in which S protein was found to be an ideal antigen for developing ELISA, with a higher sensitivity and better specificity than N protein-based ELISAs [27, 39]. Both full-length S-based and S1\u2013501-based ELISAs have much better sensitivities than the commercial N-based ELISA kit. The S-based ELISAs used in this study can be used in both SPF pigs, conventional pigs, and sows, whereas commercial N-based ELISAs only perform well in SPF pigs, which have a relatively low background and stronger immune response. The S-based ELISAs can be used to detect the immune response and the immune status of the population and is an indispensable tool in evaluating the efficacy of PEDV vaccines [39].",

Since there is no clinically confirmed serum against G1b PEDV available in our lab, the full-length of the G1b PEDV S protein derived from a historic Taiwan strain was generated and used as an antigen to immunize pigs for the generation of hyperimmune serum against S protein from G1b PEDV strains. The S protein, in particular S1, has been demonstrated to have a relatively high heterogeneity between genotypes and clusters (the identity of amino acid ranges from 91 to 99.6%) compared with other proteins [43]. The amino acid sequence of full-length S and S1\u2013501 of the G2b PEDV-PT strain share approximately 94% and 86\u201388% identity with G1b PEDV S proteins, respectively.

To standardize the coloration procedure, each plate included the same positive serum diluted 5120-fold as the positive control and the color development was stopped once the positive control colorized. The color development was evaluated using an inverted light/fluorescence microscope. To avoid any possible non-specific signals of the immunostaining, a signal was only considered positive when appearing on syncytial Vero cells, which show the CPE. If the signals appeared on the morphologically normal Vero cells but not on the CPE cells, the result was considered negative.",
