The precise role of inflammatory cells in the pathogenesis of ILD remains poorly understood [2\u20134], although evidence indicates that T lymphocytes play an important role in the initiation and development of pulmonary fibrosis [5, 6]. However, few studies evaluate the prognostic significance of T lymphocyte subsets in patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) [7]. Therefore, we hypothesized that patients with NSIP who respond successfully to corticosteroid therapy harbor different T lymphocyte subpopulations compared with patients who do not respond.",

NSIP was diagnosed according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society consensus classification [8, 9]. Patients were not treated with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before undergoing a lung biopsy. Connective tissue disease (CTD) was diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology as follows: autoantibodies against the nucleus (ANA titer >1:320), rheumatoid factor, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s-syndrome-related antigens SSA or SSB, Scl-70, Sm, anti-Jo-1, ribonucleoprotein, or cyclic citrullinated peptide [10\u201313].

No differences among the three groups were noted in arterial blood gas and HRCT findings. Abnormalities of pulmonary function were similar among the three groups and were characterized by restrictive defects with impairment of diffusion (Table 3). During follow-up, three patients (15 %) with cellular NSIP died (two from lung infections, one from liver failure), and six (21 %) and four (80 %) patients with mixed or fibrotic NSIP, respectively, died from progression of lung disease.",

In patients with interstitial pneumonia caused by graft-versus-host disease, interstitial pneumonitis develops primarily from the dissemination of perivascular CD4+ T lymphocytes infiltrates [45]. Immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide suppress inflammation caused by perivascular T lymphocytes by reducing the T lymphocyte population and ameliorating T lymphocyte function [46]. These findings, taken together with those of the present study, suggest that perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of NSIP. If CD4+ T cells are involved in ILD, treating patients with anti-T cell-specific immunosuppressants such as FK506 and anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibodies may be justified. For example, patients with ILD, particularly those with CTD-ILD, respond to these agents, [47, 48].",
