            "text": "The question of how ducks can survive challenge by all low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and most highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infections, yet chickens can only survive LPAI, remains an important question due to the economic losses experienced by the poultry industry, the human health implications and the continuing threat of pandemic disease posed by avian viruses. Most avian influenza strains are able to infect and replicate in ducks, and are usually asymptomatic and seldom cause disease. Of the 16 haemagglutinin subtypes of influenza viruses infecting migratory waterfowl, the H5 and H7 subtypes are unique. After transmission to gallinaceous poultry the H5 and H7 viruses can evolve into highly pathogenic strains. In ducks and other aquatic birds the low pathogenic H5 and H7 influenza viruses replicate predominantly in the intestinal tract without any outward clinical signs of infection. After transmission to gallinaceous poultry and acquisition of multiple basic amino acids in the connecting peptide of the haemagglutinin, the viruses become highly pathogenic and replicate systemically in the chicken [1]. HPAI has proven to be deadly to chickens within a very short time frame post-infection, although LPAI only produces mild or no signs of clinical disease [2]. Ducks on the other hand are able to mount a robust inflammatory response against most HPAI [3], although they have shown increased susceptibility to some emerging strains of H5N1, with death resulting in some cases [4\u20136]. The difference in pathogenesis seen between ducks and chickens could also be due to the fact that a rapid induction of apoptosis in HPAI-infected ducks may be beneficial to the host, whereas delayed apoptosis in chickens may be an advantage for the virus [7].",

Worryingly, the recently emerged H7N9 subtype also poses a risk of being the vector by which a human influenza epidemic occurs. The first human infections by this virus were reported early in 2013, and by June 2013, the mortality rate was over 30 % - a level still being seen as cases continue to be reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified H7N9 as \"\u2026an unusually dangerous virus for humans\u201d [8]. Although not posing an imminent threat, H10N8 has also recently been identified as having the potential to spread from birds to humans if the necessary viral mutations occur [9].",

It is known that birds have a much more compact set of immune-related genes than mammals [13, 14]. With the increasing availability of avian genome sequences, it is also becoming apparent that key genes are reportedly missing in some birds, which will affect their host responses to viral infections. These include Toll-like receptors 8 and 9 (TLR8 and TLR9) that, in humans, recognize ssRNA and CpG, respectively [15, 16]. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and TNF\u03b1 are all genes which have not yet been identified in birds [17]. When we compare the genomes of chickens and ducks we can also see differences in their immune gene complement. Crucially, chickens (but not ducks) appear to be lacking the intracellular receptor for viral ssRNA, RIG-I (also called DDX58) [18] and the gene for an important RIG-I binding protein, RNF135 [17]. These differences may also partly explain the differences seen between chickens and ducks in their responses towards avian influenza infections [17].",

These genes are part of a larger family called the Dispanins which have a common double transmembrane domain configuration [21]. In humans, IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 have been identified. The gene cluster IFITM1, 2 and 3 are known to have anti-viral function (the \u201cimmune-related\u201d or IR-IFITM gene cluster; [22]), IFITM5 may be involved in bone mineralization and the role of IFITM10 is less clear [23]. Although exactly how they function has not been fully elucidated, IFITM proteins have been found to be enriched in late endosomes and lysosomes and are thought to act before viral membrane fusion occurs [24]. Human IFITM3 has been shown to block viral entry into the host cell [25], with a requirement of the CD225 domain for inhibition of the influenza virus [26]. Until now, most of these genes remained unannotated in the chicken and duck genomes and their role in avian influenza infections was unknown.",

In this study we examine and compare the expression of innate immune related genes in chickens and ducks after infection with both LPAI (H5N2) and HPAI (H5N1); these being avian species showing high (usually leading to death) and low susceptibility (mostly asymptomatic), respectively. We looked at the host immune response and viral replication in the ileum and lung 1 and 3 days post infection (dpi). HPAI viruses replicate primarily in the respiratory tract prior to systemic spread with generalized replication and death, while low pathogenic viruses replicate primarily in the intestinal tract and to a limited extent in the respiratory tract with no apparent disease signs [27]. Dramatic differences in host responses to avian influenza infection were found in chickens and ducks. In ducks IFITM1, 2 and 3 are strongly up regulated in response to HPAI virus, where little response is seen in chickens. Clustering of gene expression profiles suggests IFITM1 and 2 have an anti-viral response and IFITM3 may act before viral membrane fusion occurs and thus blocks viral entry. We also show through molecular phylogenetic analyses that avian IFITM1 and 3 genes have been subject to both episodic and pervasive positive selection at specific codons. Specifically, avian IFITM1 shows evidence of positive selection in the duck lineage at a site known to restrict avian influenza virus (AIV) infection. Overexpression of this gene in vitro has been shown to increase the resistance of avian cells to AIV infection [28], probably by a block in membrane fusion, crucial to the entry and further replication of this virus. Taken together these results support a model where the IFITM123 family and RIG-I play a crucial role in the tolerance of ducks to high and low pathogenic strains of avian influenza viruses when compared to the chicken and other Galliformes.",

These three groups of IFITM sequences were used to create a multiple sequence alignment (Additional file 4: Figure S2) and in the construction of a phylogenetic gene tree (Additional file 5: Figure S3). As expected, the IFITM5 and 10 genes cluster into distinct clades in birds, other non-avian reptiles, mammals and amphibians but the picture for the IR-IFITM gene family was more complex. In birds, the three IR-IFITM genes cluster into three distinct groups of IFITM1, 2 and 3 sequences. In mammals, however the genes tend to cluster together within their own species or clades, indicating more recent clade-specific gene expansions, as shown before by Zhang et al. [22] making it impossible to define 1:1 orthologs between avian and mammalian IFITM1, 2 and 3-like genes. In an attempt to resolve this issue and define the gene duplication events that gave rise to this family, we prepared a multiple sequence alignment of the IR-IFITM protein family. To increase the power of our analysis we collected IFITM1, 2 and 3-like peptide sequences from a wide range of vertebrates including birds, non-avian reptiles, mammals and amphibians. After multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MUSCLE, we removed partial, duplicated or highly divergent (likely to be sequencing errors or incorrect spliced products) peptide sequences, after which 148 peptide sequences remained in the final multiple sequence alignment (Additional file 6: Figure S4). MrBayes, a Bayesian package for inference [29, 30], was used to infer phylogenetic trees from the MSA of IFITM1/2/3-like peptide sequences (Fig. 1). There appeared to be a single clade of IFITM1-like genes in the amphibians (Xenopus species), which suggested an independent origin from birds and mammals. The Xenopus sequences were therefore used to root the gene tree. The tree showed strong support for independent IFITM gene duplications in mammals and reptiles. In mammals, as Zhang et al. [22] have shown previously, there were a number of clade-specific expansions of this gene family. However in birds, there were only two gene duplications that gave rise to the avian IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. The IFITM2 and 3 genes appear to have arisen from an avian-specific gene duplication, with only a single IFITM2/3-like gene in non-avian reptiles. The IFITM1 gene appears to have arisen from an earlier gene duplication in all reptiles. This Bayesian analysis was supported by similar analyses based on Maximum Likelihood, Neighbour-Joining and Parsimony methods, as implemented in the MEGA6 package (Additional file 7: Figure S5) using the JTT + G_I model predicted as the most likely substitution model (Additional file 8: Table S3). These results also show that the structure and function of the avian IFITM123 protein family is most likely to share elements of all the human IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins of the IR-IFITM gene cluster.",

MEME is a method implemented within the DATAMONKEY package [32] that can identify both episodic and persistent positive selection because it allows the distribution of the dN/dS ratio to vary from site to site and from branch to branch at a site. In birds, only two genes - IFITM1 and 3 show sites with strong evidence of positive selection. For IFITM1, most sites (6 codons) were found in the second transmembrane domain (TM2). In addition, one site was found in each of the N- (codon 30) and C- (codon 135) termini of the IFITM1 peptide. Only two sites (codons 106 and 112) were predicted to show persistent positive selection in all avian branches. Most sites showed evidence of episodic positive selection in one (codon 30 ANAPL at a site known to restrict influenza viruses [26], codon 100 PHALE and codon 117 CALAN) or a few species (codons 102, 118 and 135). These results were supported by FUBAR [33], which detected persistent sites of positive selection at codons 106, 112, 118 and 135, also detected by MEME (Additional file 9: Table S4). No significant sites were found using CODEML for IFITM1 (Additional file 10: Table S5), suggesting most were episodic sites. The other gene, IFITM3, was predicted to have fewer positively selected sites (only 3 codons), in one (codon 98 APTFO and codon 136 CUCCA) or more species (codon 119). Again, the transmembrane TM2 domain contained most sites (2/3 of cases). CODEML predicted two additional sites of persistent positive selection in both IFITM3 and 10 (2 in the N-terminus) (Additional file 10: Table S5). These results suggest that the TM2 domain is likely to be important in recognition of pathogen-associated lipids. Of great interest was positive selection at codon 30 (Thr - > Pro) in ducks, at a site known to restrict influenza viruses [26].",

This not only allowed us to determine the profile of IFITM gene expression, but also defined the host innate immune response after influenza infection in each species and allowed a comparison between species to be made. Since LPAI viruses from ducks are the ultimate source of HPAI viruses in chickens we used a LPAI H5N2 and a HPAI H5N1 strain to examine the host response to each class of influenza virus. This study involved the use of two different tissues known to be targets of viral infection (lung and ileum) in three different conditions (uninfected control or infected with either LPAI H5N2 or HPAI H5N1) at two different time points (1 dpi and 3 dpi), which would allow us to study the host response in each species. Differential expression of genes was thus determined for 12 different experimental scenarios in each of duck and chicken, as outlined in Table 2, with the main interest being on the differences that would be seen between duck and chicken. The numbers of genes regarded as significantly differentially expressed, FDR <0.05 and which have a fold-change >1.5 are listed.

Ducks were infected with 106EID50 of HPAI H5N1; the virus replicated to high titres in the lungs and ileum and 6/10 ducks died between 4 and 6 dpi. Viral doses were chosen to reflect earlier studies [2, 18].",

From the numbers of DE genes (Table 2), it can be seen that the chicken mounts a large response to H5N1 in the ileum by 1 dpi . However, this is short-lived and is gone by 3 dpi. This response against H5N1 is not reflected in the lung. The highly pathogenic H5N1 appears to prove too much for the chicken - the response seen early in the ileum is not sustained, and the birds succumb to the disease. A strong response is seen in the lung by 3 dpi, after H5N2 infection. The ileum is not particularly affected by H5N2 infection and the robust response seen in the lung is obviously able to counter the effects of the virus, stop further spread, and the chicken is able to survive the LPAI infection.",

Lipid rafts play an important role in the life cycle of the virus, including infection, assembly and budding. Lipid rafts are also important in the transport and assembly of viral components as well as in budding and virus release [34, 35]. The significance of the T- and B-cell response in the chicken can be seen during the host response to H5N2 infection in the lung at 3 dpi. Some of the most up-regulated genes include T-cell markers, CD8B, CD4, CD3E and CD28, along with CD79B which codes for part of the B-cell receptor complex and CXCR5 which is involved in B-cell migration. Fig. 2b shows the canonical pathways significantly affected during the chicken host response to H5N2.

Clustering the data allowed us to highlight a particular group of genes which were more strongly expressed in the non-viral samples. Functional analysis of these genes showed them to be very immune-specific. Many of the genes were immunoglobulin genes and genes found on the surface of immune cells (particularly T-cells). This would indicate that these particular birds were able to prevent virus from actually entering the lung tissue by means of increasing expression of genes such as PTPRC, CD44, CD3E, CD8B, CTLA4, TNFRSF13C, CD79B, IL2RG, CD4, ITGA4, CD5 and CD28.",

This reflects how ducks are unperturbed by LPAI infection and suggests they may be able to somehow block the virus before it enters the cell. Upon infection with H5N1, the duck mounts a robust innate response, with large numbers of genes significantly differentially expressed in both lung and ileum. The response in the ileum increases from 1 to 3 dpi whereas in the lung, a large response is already underway 1 dpi and is maintained through 3 dpi.

We have previously shown TLR1LA to be activated during the host response to Marek\u2019s Disease Virus [39]. Levels of TLR4 are increased by heat shock proteins and various cellular factors produced during infection, while the ligand for TLR7 is ssRNA, of which the H5N1 genome is comprised. IRF, IL8, IL10 and IL17A signalling are all also up-regulated, indicating a robust cytokine response (Fig. 3a and b). Some of the most highly up-regulated genes seen during the duck host response to H5N1 include RSAD2 (viperin) which encodes an interferon-inducible antiviral protein involved in TLR7-dependent production of IFNB, MX1 which is known to have antiviral activity against avian influenza and DDX58 (RIG-I) which encodes a pattern recognition receptor for viruses.

Samples from 3 infected birds were compared to 3 uninfected controls and normalized against eukaryotic 18 s rRNA expression. Large differences in IFITM expression were confirmed, with virtually no response in the chicken and significant up-regulation in the duck (Table 4 and Fig. 5). The very large IFITM2 response seen in the duck (553-fold up-regulation) is most probably an over-exaggerated estimate due to the wide variability seen in uninfected ducks (Additional file 19: Figure S11). If the outlier bird is removed, then up-regulation is approximately 16-fold, which is similar to the relative ratios of expression seen with the RNAseq data.",

In this way we could identify genes that are co-regulated with the IFITM genes and thus infer correlated gene functions (\u201cguilt by association\u201d). Avian IFITM1 and 2 were seen to cluster with genes highly enriched with roles in anti-viral responses (Additional file 20: Table S9) while IFITM3 was very different and clustered with genes involved with organelle membranes and apoptotic processes (Additional file 21: Table S10). Avian IFITM3 is also co-expressed with genes involved in phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of IFITM3 is thought to be important in determining its sub-cellular location and anti-viral function [40]. The results of this study confirm the involvement of avian IFITM1, 2 and 3 in the host response to avian influenza LPAI and HPAI viruses.",

Multiple amino acid sequence alignments of the proteins encoded by these avian IFITM1 and 3 genes reveals a number of conserved motifs, shown to be functional in the homologous regions of the human IR-IFITM proteins (Fig. 7). All these proteins share the highly conserved TM1-CIL-TM2 structure, core to the IFITM protein family. The TM1-CIL or CD225 domain is the most conserved region.

The chicken immune system is able to counter LPAI H5N2, but unable to respond effectively to the HPAI H5N1. B- and T-cells are induced in response to H5N2, but an initial early immune response in the ileum against H5N1 is ultimately insufficient to clear the virus and the animal succumbs to infection. The response seen in the ileum primarily involves lipid metabolism genes. The duck, on the other hand, is barely required to produce a response against H5N2 since LPAI is not seen as pathogenic and is able to initiate a robust host response to H5N1 infection. A strong cytokine response along with induction of the TLR and RIG-I pathways ensure that the duck is able to survive or delay infection with the more pathogenic H5N1 virus. RIG-I is involved in the initial cytosolic detection of virus in the host cell and TLRs are responsible for the induction of signalling cascades leading to the production of type-I interferons. When the chicken response to H5N2 was compared to the H5N1 response in the duck, two unique host-specific responses were seen.",

IFITM1, 2 and 3-like proteins are already known to have anti-viral function in mammals [23], with IFITM3 specifically shown to restrict the effects of influenza in a mouse knockout model [20]. The sequence data presented in this study was therefore used to determine their activity in birds. A recent report by Smith et al. [28] demonstrates that over-expression of chicken IFITM1 (annotated as chIFITM3 in that study) restricts influenza in vitro. We show that in vivo chickens mount a nearly non-existent IFITM response, with an ineffectual early induction of IFITM3 in the ileum against H5N1 infection, which is not maintained. Conversely, the duck is able to mount and sustain an effective induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in both the lung and ileum during H5N1 progression. Chickens are seen to show an early up-regulation of lipid metabolism genes in the ileum against HPAI. This is most likely a reflection of the viral/host membrane fusion and subsequent viral replication which is occurring. This lipid response is not seen in the duck. IFITM1, 2 and 3 have been shown to block viral membrane hemifusion (when the outer membranes of the two lipid bilayers have fused but the inner membranes are still intact). The IFITM proteins alter the lipid composition of the membrane and decrease membrane fluidity, thus restricting viral fusion [44]. So, the differential response of lipid-associated genes seen between chicken and duck is most probably due, in part, to the hugely different IFITM response seen between these two species.",

            "text": "Along with the presence/absence of various immune genes and the differing affinities of the influenza virus for host sialic acid receptors, the different IFITM responses we have seen in chickens and ducks are very probably, one of the reasons contributing to the duck\u2019s ability to mitigate HPAI where it proves lethal to the chicken. The evolutionary selective forces also acting upon the IFITM genes will, in turn, promote mutation of the influenza viruses themselves as part of the on-going \u2018arms race\u2019 of which viruses and hosts find themselves a part. The apparent absence of RIG-I in Galliform birds [17] along with the poor IFITM expression we have seen during infection in chickens may also be contributory factors as to why certain H5 and H7 viral subtypes are able to become highly pathogenic in these birds. Why only H5 and H7 strains (thus far) are evolving in their pathogenic potential remains to be determined. The emergence of the H7N9 influenza subtype and its recent infection of humans, along with the developing susceptibility of ducks to some highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses [4] highlight the ever-increasing need to identify and understand the resistance mechanisms deployed by hosts against these viruses.",

Genewise [46] was used to predict coding regions in genomic DNAs using avian or mammalian IFITM peptide sequences. In some cases 5\u2019-RACE was used to determine the full coding sequence from total RNA isolated from spleen tissues. 5'-RACE was performed on 10 \u03bcg of duck spleen total RNA using the First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, the RNA was treated with Calf Intestinal Phosphatase to remove 5'-phosphates from degraded mRNA, rRNA, tRNA and DNA. The cap structure on intact mRNA was removed with Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase allowing a proprietary 5'-RACE adapter to be ligated to the de-capped mRNA. Random-primed reverse transcription followed by nested PCR, with supplied forward primers and gene specific reverse primers (Additional file 22: Table S11), was performed to amplify the 5' ends of the IFITM genes. PCR conditions: 1st round: 1 \u03bcl of the RT reaction was amplified with 10pmol of each outer primer in 20 \u03bcl using FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche) in the supplied reaction buffer containing 200 \u03bcm each dNTP and 1x GC-RICH solution (Roche). Amplification conditions were 5 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 60 \u00b0C, 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by 5 min at 72 \u00b0C. 2nd round: 2 \u03bcl of the first round PCR was amplified with 25pmol of each inner primer in 50 \u03bcl using FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche) in the supplied reaction buffer containing 200 \u03bcm each dNTP and 1x GC-RICH solution (Roche). Amplification conditions were 5 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 \u00b0C, 30 s at 60 \u00b0C, 1 min at 72 \u00b0C, followed by 5 min at 72 \u00b0C.

Four independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were used with the temperature of 0.2. Two repetitions were run for 1,000,000 generations with tree and parameter sampling occurring every 1,000 generations. The first 25 % of trees were discarded as burn-in, leaving 750 trees per run. Posterior probabilities for internal node were calculated from the posterior density of trees. To confirm the general conclusions from MrBayes analysis we also used Maximum parsimony (MP), Neighbour-Joining (NJ) and Maximum likelihood (ML) to reconstruct trees with bootstrap values of 500 repetitions within the MEGA6 package [58]. Phylogenetic trees were displayed using FigTree [59].",

MEME can find evidence of both episodic and pervasive positive selection at individual codons, even when the majority of branches are subject to purifying selection. FUBAR on the other hand was designed to detect pervasive positive selection at individual codons. Therefore the additional sites detected by MEME and not by FUBAR are likely to have been subject to episodes of positive selection. For these analyses the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was determined through the automatic model selection tool available on the server. To investigate whether gene conversion occurred in avian IFITM genes all sequences were screened for recombination using GARD implemented within the DATAMONKEY server. No evidence of recombination was found in these avian sequences. We also compared the results from DATAMONKEY with two alternative models implemented in CODEML (PAML 4.4) [61]: M8, which allows for codons to evolve under positive selection (dN/dS > 1) and M8A, which does not (dN/dS \u2264 1). These two nested models were compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) with two degrees of freedom. The analysis was run several times with the F3x4 model of codon frequencies. Codons under positive selection for model M8 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach and considering a posterior probability of > 95 %. For each analysis the species tree used was based on a new phylogenetic tree of birds based on evidence from the multiple sequence alignment of 48 avian genomes [62] as part of the \u201cBird Phylogenomic Project\u201d, hosted by the Beijing Genomics Institute [55].",

Genes differentially expressed during the host response (False discovery rate (FDR) <0.05) were analysed against a reference background consisting of all genes expressed in the experiment. Annotation of the chicken genes was based upon the human orthologs. Use of the IPA program (Ingenuity\u00ae Systems) [66] revealed which canonical pathways and physiological functions are affected by AIV infection in the host (Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction; FDR < 0.05). Genes were clustered by similar expression pattern and analysed for enriched GO-terms and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) using Expander (v5.1) [67]. Normalised expression data from control samples were compared with infected samples to examine the host response to AIV infection. Enrichment of particular GO terms or TFBS within clusters was done by using the TANGO and PRIMA algorithms, respectively, within the Expander package. Analysis of genes clustering with the IFITM genes was carried out by first grouping the genes using \u201cclustergram\u201d within the MATLAB Statistics toolbox (2009) [68] and then examining their function using DAVID v6.7 [69, 70].",
