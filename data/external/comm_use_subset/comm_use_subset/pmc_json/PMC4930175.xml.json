Sequestration of miR-122 with miravirsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting miR-122, resulted in a prolonged and dose-dependent decrease in HCV RNA titers in a clinical study [9]. In addition to its proviral function for HCV, miR-122 regulates hepatic function and cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolisms [10, 11]. Interference of miR-122 function using an antisense oligonucleotide decreased cholesterol levels in plasma [11]. In addition, it was found that miR-122 downregulates its target genes that may be involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis, thus acting as a tumor suppressor [12\u201315].",

In addition, the interface between viruses and miRNAs can alter predefined cellular regulatory networks of miRNAs by re-programming miRNA types and abundance. miRNA expression is controlled at various stages of transcription and processing, and its level and function can be further regulated by mature sequence modifications. miRNA 3\u2032 modification is known to regulate its stability or turnover [19], and recent high-throughput sequencing studies revealed extensive 3\u2032-terminal modifications on miRNAs in animal cells [20].

In addition, a decreased miR-122 level was detected in sera from patients with HCV [21, 22]. However, little is known regarding how the cellular abundance of miR-122 is regulated by HCV. We report in this study that the HCV core protein inhibits GLD-2\u2019s terminal mononucleotidyl transferase activity, resulting in the downregulation of miR-122 isomers bearing non-templated 3\u2032-end single-nucleotide additions and thereby the dysregulation of miR-122 function. Our results demonstrate a novel role of the HCV core protein in regulating viral replication and translation through GLD-2-mediated miR-122 stability control.",

Therefore, we performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries from human liver biopsy specimens from healthy individuals (N-1 and N-2) and patients with HCV (HCV-1 to HCV-3) (S2 Table shows details on the small RNA types and their read counts). Among diverse miRNA [578 (for HCV-2) to 775 (for HCV-3) species identified by aligning the reads to 1,080 prototype miRNAs in the miRNA database] expressed in human liver tissues, miR-122 was the most abundantly expressed miRNA. We detected various miR-122 species in the range of 16 to 25 nucleotide (nt) in length (S3 Table). Because miR-122 isomers of 21, 22, and 23 nt in length are three prominent species, which were detectable by northern blot analysis of total RNA from Huh7 cells and primary hepatocytes (S2A and S2C Fig), and other individual isomers comprised <2% of the total read counts of all forms of miR-122 species (with a read frequency of >50 reads per million) in biopsies, we focused on these three isomers for further sequence analysis.",

In contrast, the proportion of the 23-nt isomer dramatically decreased, whereas the ratio for the 22-nt miR-22 prototype species only slightly decreased. The 23-nt isomer, including five different species, had either a templated nucleotide [i.e., the 3\u2032-end U residue derived from precursor miR122 (pre-miR-122); Fig 3B, top shows the partial primary miR-122 (pri-miR-122) secondary structure and sequence] or a non-templated nucleotide (i.e., isomers bearing a dinucleotide of 3\u2032-GA, 3\u2032-GG, and 3\u2032-GC in the 23-nt isomer in which the penultimate G is derived from a template or a 3\u2032-AU dinucleotide; underlined sequences represent non-templated additions) at their 3\u2032 ends.

In fact, isomer profile analysis for the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the liver biopsies revealed that all miRNAs bear a single 3\u2032 terminal non-templated or templated nucleotide (any of four ribonucleotide residues) with adenylate and uridylate being two major terminal nucleotides (S3 Fig).",

Similar results were also observed both in Huh7 cells transiently expressing core protein and in HCV-infected Huh7 cells (Fig 3D), in which only 3\u2032-end mono-adenylated or uridylated species were detected probably due to ~100-fold lower miR-122 levels in Huh7 cells (Fig 1A and S4 Table).",

We silenced each of a series of known terminal nucleotidyl transferases using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and found that miR-122 abundance is specifically regulated by GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase [29] [also known as terminal uridylyl transferase 2 (TUTase-2)] (Fig 4A). Silencing of GLD-2 expression with increasing doses of siRNA (Fig 4B), which was not associated with a substantial cell viability decrease (Fig 4C), decreased the cellular abundance of three major miR-122 isomers (21-, 22-, and 23-nt isomers) (Fig 4D), resulting in an overall 49% decrease in their miRNA levels and consequent decreases in HCV subgenomic RNA and viral protein (NS3 and NS5B) levels (Fig 4B and 4D). As observed in GLD-2 knock-downed cells, the 23-nt miR-122 isomers as well as the two other major isomers (21-nt and 22-nt species) concurrently decreased both in Huh7 cells transiently expressing the core protein and in HCV-infected cells (S2A and S2B Fig), suggesting that the miR-122 level reduction does not occur in a step-by-step manner in the order of decreasing length of isomers. Furthermore, when the core protein was expressed in GLD-2 knock-downed cells, miR-122 levels decreased further (Fig 4E, see the cells treated with 1 or 5 nM siGLD-2). However, when GLD-2 expression was substantially silenced with higher concentrations of siRNA, this inhibitory effect of core protein was diminished, suggesting that miR-122 level regulation by core protein is a GLD-2-dependent event.",

We addressed these questions using highly purified recombinant GLD-2 and core proteins (Fig 5A).

This result was unexpected because GLD-2 was originally identified as a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that acts on certain mRNAs [29, 30] but was consistent with previous studies illustrating GLD-2-mediated miR-122 3\u2032 adenylation [19, 31]. Importantly, we found that GLD-2 was capable of adding any of the four ribonucleotides to the miR-122 3\u2032 end with almost similar efficiency (Fig 5C). Similarly, GLD-2 added any of four ribonucleotides to the 3\u2032 end of eight other miRNAs (S5A Fig) randomly selected from the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in human liver, with different efficiencies (S5B Fig). Surprisingly, miR-122-5-p was most efficiently modified by GLD-2. Further analysis of GLD-2 template specificity using ribonucleotide homopolymers (20-nt) revealed that (A)20 is the best template of GLD-2 for 3\u2032-end adenylation, uridylation, guanylation, and cytidylation (S5C Fig). These findings suggest that GLD-2 has a certain degree of selectivity on small RNAs for 3\u2032 end modification. Using the miR-122-5p that was most efficiently adenylated by GLD-2, we revealed that the HCV core protein inhibits GLD-2\u2019s 3\u2032-end monoadenylation activity, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) capsid protein had little effect on GLD-2 activity (Fig 5D).",

In contrast, other truncation mutants [GFP-C(1\u201375), GFP-C(1\u2013121), and GFP-C(1\u2013173)], which translocated to the nucleus, failed to decrease miR-122 levels (Fig 6C and 6D), indicating that GLD-2 inhibition-mediated miR-122 expression regulation by the core protein is a cytoplasmic process. These results also indicate that the RNA-binding activity of the core protein is not involved in this regulation because GFP-C(76\u2013191) and GFP-C(99\u2013191), lacking the known RNA-binding domain (amino acids 1\u201375) [34], did also reduce miR-122 levels.

This mutant showed a weaker affinity to GLD-2 as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig 6F). More importantly, this deletion mutant was barely colocalized with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm, whereas GFP-C(1\u2013191) and core protein expressed in Huh7 cells by transfection of HCV RNA colocalzied with GLD-2 in the perinuclear regions and lipid droplet-like structures (Fig 6G). HCV RNA (JFH-1 in vitro transcripts)-transfected Huh7 cells showed enhanced colocalization of the core protein with GLD-2 compared with the cells expressing the GFP-fused core protein alone, suggesting that core protein-GLD-2 interaction in cells might be affected by viral protein expression and/or viral genome replication.",

Similarly, these miR-122 isomers were more effective in enhancing HCV IRES-mediated translation compared with the shorter forms of miR-122, the 21- and 22-nt isomers (Fig 7B). We found that the single nucleotide-extended miR-122 isomers displayed improved stability compared with the 22-nt isomer when their cellular stability was assessed by northern blot analysis for the residual amounts of miR-122-5p following the incubation of individual duplex miRNAs in HeLa cell extracts (Fig 7C). These results demonstrate that miR-122 isomers modified by GLD-2-mediated 3\u2032 non-templated addition display increased miRNA activity and stability, implying that GLD-2 inhibition by the HCV core protein promotes miR-122 destabilization to dysregulate its functions in the liver and in the HCV life cycle.",

Similarly, in a cellular context, helper protein might also govern GLD-2 specificity toward miR-122. Notably, the miRNA species, for which the adenylated isomer levels were decreased by HCV infection, were not perfectly matched to the GLD-2 depletion-sensitive (in terms of stability) miRNAs in human fibroblasts [19]. Thus, the type of miRNAs post-transcriptionally modified by GLD-2 might be determined by cell-type specific cofactors used by GLD-2 to recognize a specific set of miRNAs. Nevertheless, GLD-2 appears to a higher affinity for miR-122-5p preferentially for mono-ribonucleotide addition to its 3\u2032-end compared with either other liver resident miRNAs we tested (S5B Fig).

            "text": "Given that miR-122 is a specific template of GLD-2, one important question is whether the non-templated addition of all four different nucleotides to miR-122 is catalyzed by GLD-2 alone. An early study claimed that C. elegans GLD-2 from reticulocyte lysates programmed with a plasmid encoding GLD-2 exhibited a strict ATP dependency on a C35A10 substrate [29]. GLD-2 monoadenlyation activity on miR-122 was also previously demonstrated with an immunoprecipitated mouse GLD-2 [19, 31] and a recombinant GDL-2 fused to the C-terminal end of GST [19]. Interestingly, the GST-fused GLD-2 used in the latter study displayed a weak preference for ATP over UTP on miR-122. Our terminal nucleotidyl transferase assays conducted using His-tagged recombinant GLD-2 revealed that any of the four ribonucleotides can be added to the 3\u2032-end of miR-122 without preference for ATP (Fig 5C), raising the possibility that the non-templated additions of all four different nucleotides to the miR-122 3\u2032 end might be catalyzed by GLD-2. Supporting this hypothesis, we detected the 23-nt miR-122 isomers modified by the non-templated addition of a single A, G, or C residue in five different liver biopsies analyzed. The ability of GLD-2 to use UTP and ATP as a substrate was also observed in the 24-nt isomers in which the U-tailed 23-nt isomer (it can be derived by the non-templated addition or aberrant processing of pre-miR-122) was further extended by the addition of a single uridylate or adenylate residue. Owing to the high abundance of miR-122 in the liver, the analysis of our small RNA sequencing datasets enabled us to identify previously uncovered 24-nt miR-122 species that carry a dinucleotide (AA and AU; all represent non-templated nucleotides that always start with A) or a 25-nt species bearing a triple nucleotide sequence (UUU; underlined sequences represent non-templated nucleotides). In these miR-122 species, the non-templated addition of uridylate residues was repeatedly observed. These results further suggest that GLD-2 may have an intrinsic capability of using diverse nucleotides as substrates. If consistent with the in vitro findings for GLD-2, the inhibition of GLD-2 by the HCV core protein would lower the proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing any single non-templated nucleotides at their 3\u2032 ends. Indeed, the read frequency of all of the abovementioned miR-122 species was substantially decreased in liver biopsies from patients with HCV (S3 Table). A study illustrated that the Zcchc11-dependent uridylation of miR-26a and 26b attenuates miRNA-target repression [37]. However, uridylation of miR-122 enhanced its stability and miRNA activity, highlighting the importance of the fine regulation of miRNA 3\u2032-end modification for executing the optimal functions of individual miRNAs. Finally, it should be stated that there was a substantial decrease in the proportion of the single U-tailed abundantly present 23-nt miR-122 isomer (aberrantly processed or terminally modified one), suggesting that pre-miR-122 processing in its single-stranded loop region might also be influenced by HCV infection (30%\u201333% of 22-nt canonical miR-122 in normal liver versus 14%\u201318% in patient liver biopsies). This interesting issue is currently under further investigation.",

            "text": "In addition to its role as a structural protein, the HCV core protein is also known to be involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [38]. The tumor suppressor activity of miR-122 is well characterized in cells and miR-122 knockout mice [12\u201315]. Thus, our results imply that the HCV core protein may contribute to liver cancer development by decreasing miR-122 levels. Decreased miR-122 expression resulting from core protein expression during the course of chronic HCV infection may in part explain the oncogenic phenotype previously observed in cell culture and transgenic mice expressing the core protein [38]. Furthermore, the core protein-expressing transgenic mice and miR-122 knockout mice both are characterized by hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, followed by the development of hepatocellular carcinoma with age, further supporting the role of the core protein in liver diseases through its ability to promote miR-122 destabilization by inhibiting GLD-2. Studies have suggested that let-7i-5p and miR-29a-3p act as tumor suppressors because of their ability to repress oncogenes [39, 40]. It remains to be investigated whether the functions of these anti-cancer miRNAs are regulated by alteration in their 3\u2032-end modification as observed in liver biopsies from patients with HCV (S4 Fig). If this is confirmed, GLD-2 inhibition by the core protein can be one of the mechanisms accelerating tumor development by chronic HCV infection through a previously uncovered pathway. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that GLD-2 is downregulated in several cancers, as revealed by a gene expression meta-analysis [41], implying that the loss of GLD-2 could be involved in carcinogenesis.",

So, what might be the consequence of GLD-2 inhibition by the core protein? We can speculate that cytoplasmic poly (A) addition to some host mRNAs 3\u2032-UTR can be inhibited by the HCV core protein. Inhibition of host translation by virus infection is mediated by the inactivation of translation initiation factor 2 through its phosphorylation by PKR, a type I interferon inducible gene [43]. Because many viruses, including HCV, suppress or abrogate the type I interferon signaling pathway and PKR activation by diverse mechanisms [44], whereas subgroups of host mRNAs are yet subjected to down-regulation, it is tempting to speculate that GLD-2 inhibition by the HCV core protein affects host mRNA translation. It remains to be characterized what host mRNAs are subjected to this regulation to understand the impact of the chronic inhibition of GLD-2 in liver pathophysiology.",

The beneficial effect of miR-122 in HCV replication and translation can be repressed by the accumulation of the core protein, which determines the degree to which the host supports viral replication and thus plays a role in establishing persistent infection. Suppressing miR-122 levels in addition to sequestering of miR-122 by the HCV genome as reported recently [45] might be viral strategies to control viral titers. These miR-122 suppressing effect would also contribute in promoting liver diseases and cancer development.",

The pEGFP-C(1\u2013191), pEGFP-C(1\u201375), pEGFP-C(1\u2013121), pEGFP-C(1\u2013173), pEGFP-C(76\u2013191), pEGFP-C(99\u2013191) [48], and pEGFP-C(151\u2013191), in which the numbers in parentheses indicate the amino acid positions in the core protein, were used for the expression of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-fused HCV core protein and its deletion derivatives. psiCHECK-2_CULT1(WT) and psiCHECK-2_CULT1(MT) were kindly provided by Liang-Hu Qu (Sun Yat-Sen University, China). These dual luciferase reporters contain the 3\u2032-UTR fragment of cut-like homeobox 1 (i.e., CULT1), a transcriptional repressor of genes specifying terminal differentiation in hepatocytes, carrying either the miR-122 target sequence or its mismatched target sequence (Fig 2A) [23]. The pTrcHisB-GLD-2 plasmid was constructed by inserting GLD-2 cDNA amplified by RT-PCR using forward (5\u2032-CCGGCTAGCATGTTCCAAACTCAATTTTGGG-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-CGAAGCTTTTATCTTTTCAGGACAGCAGCTC-3\u2032) primers into the pTrcHisB vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) via the NheI and HindIII sites.

SARS-CoV capsid protein and the HCV core protein, which were expressed in Escherichia coli as N-terminal His-tagged full-length forms, were prepared as previously described [46, 51]. miRNAs were obtained from ST Pharm (Seoul, Korea).
