This virus has the capacity to infect almost all mammals. Although RABV is usually maintained in distinct host species-associated transmission cycles, typically within the Carnivora and Chiroptera\n5\u20137, host shift events are still of public health concern due to increasing risks of human exposures7. Recent host shifts between carnivores include the re-emergence of RABV in wild Taiwan ferret-badgers8, as well as the outbreaks of domestic dog-associated RABV in Ethiopian wolves9 and of striped skunk-associated RABV in gray foxes in California10. It has also been reported that multiple host shifts between bat and mesocarnivores have occurred with the big brown bat-associated RABV in Arizona11. In South America, the vampire bat, a reservoir of RABV, is resposible for the high number of rabies cases among terrestrial mammals in the rural cycle12. Therefore, RABV is a useful model for studying the mechanisms of bat virus host shifts13.",

The first occurred thousands of years ago and has resulted in worldwide rabies epidemics in terrestrial mammals through the present6. The second permanent host shift appears to have occurred in North America, producing a lineage including two variants, raccoon rabies virus (RRV) and south-central skunk variant (SCSKV). SCSKV mainly circulates in striped skunks and sporadically in other terrestrial animals, such as wolf. The RRV variant was first found in raccoons in Northern America and has seriously threatened the health of raccoons6, 14. Before the 1970s, rabid raccoons were limited to the southeastern United States15. Following the detection of RRV in West Virginia in the 1970s, however, the distribution of rabid raccoons has spread at an alarming rate, becoming an epizootic that affects many thousands of square kilometers in North America15, 16. Until 1998, raccoons have had the highest incidence of rabies of all species in the United States17. Elucidating the genetic mechanism underlying the second historical permanent host shift may aid in controlling future pandemics of bat RABV and other viruses in terrestrial animals.",

Of these, G is inserted into the envelope and is responsible for viral attachment to the host cell surface, receptor binding, and membrane fusion19. In addition, G also influences viral pathogenicity and neurotropism20, inducing the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies21. Thus, the G protein clearly plays a key role in determining RABV infection and adaptation to the host. In this study, we dissected the phylogenetic history of the G genes of SCSKV and RRV and found that they are recombinants stemming from the same recombination events. The key genetic component responsible for receptor binding in RRV and SCSKV derives from a carnivore RABV, while the remaining half of the gene derives from a bat RABV. Therefore, the homologous recombination (HR) event appears to have allowed the bat RABV to rapidly adapt to a carnivore host, initiating an epidemic among the carnivores of North America.",

We initially compared all of the variable sites in the A09-255, CA, and LAH60 G genes and discovered two crossover sites. Between the two crossover sites, A09-255 shared higher similarity with the carnivore virus, while outside of this region, A09-255 exhibited higher sequence identity with the bat RABV (Fig. 1A). Comparison of a complete RRV genome with the bat and carnivore RABVs also demonstrated a similar G gene pattern (see Additional File 4). Bootscan analysis of the G gene with an outgroup (Lagos bat viruses 8619NGA and 0406SEN) indicated that this discordant sequence likely derives from HR. Two crossover sites were also identified in the bootscan analysis (Fig. 1B). Between the two crossover sites, A09-255 was found to be homologous to carnivore RABVs, while it was more similar to bat RABVs outside of this region. Taken together, these results suggest that the G gene of SCSKV likely underwent a recombination event, resulting in the two breakpoints. Using the three representative isolates, the recombination event was further examined through seven recombination analysis methods implemented in the RDP software package, which properly allows for statistical analysis of the probability of recombination (Fig. 1C).\n",

For example, influenza A viruses are notorious for causing frequent pandemics because chicken, pig, and human viral strains can exchange their genomic segments through genetic reassortment, a type of recombination seen in viruses with segmented genomes37, 38. In retroviruses, HR between viruses from different primate hosts is associated with the emergence of the human immunodeficiency virus39. Recombination has also led to changes in host tropism in positive-strand RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses (CoVs). The CoV that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) may have arisen from a recombination event between a bat CoV and another virus before infecting human and carnivore hosts40. A Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV recombinant lineage has been dominant since December 2014 and subsequently led to human outbreaks in 201541. Despite such examples in other viruses, HR is commonly thought to be rare or absent among negative-strand RNA viruses (NSRVs)40, 42. Therefore, recombination has not typically been considered as a genetic mechanism behind NSRV host shifts40.",

Spillover infections of RABV can occur in the American bat and terrestrial mammals43, providing the opportunity for recombination between bat and carnivore RABVs. The most likely hosts for the recombination event derive from natural RABV vectors, where viruses can persist and undergo vertical transmission, thereby increasing the probability of recombination. To date, these mosaic viruses mainly circulate in striped skunk and raccoon, although they can sporadically be isolated from other species, suggesting that other animals may only represent dead-end hosts. The American bat, striped skunk, and raccoon are the natural reservoir hosts of RABV44. Therefore, we propose that the recombination event may have occurred in one of these three species. Moreover, these three RABV natural vectors live within the same environmental niche, increasing the opportunity for co-infection and recombination. Since recombinant offspring have not yet been found circulating in bat, the recombination may have occurred instead in a terrestrial animal infected by the carnivore RABV parent when the bat virus (the major parental strain) infection occurred. Considering that SCSKV is more closely related to the MRCA of the recombinant variant than the raccoon sub-lineage (Fig. 2), an American striped skunk is the most likely candidate host for the co-infection and recombination (Fig. 5C). Future studies should attempt to determine which particular cell types are the most likely host cells for the recombination event in striped skunk.",

Both receptor recognition and membrane fusion are mediated by the G protein, which is trimeric and forms spikes that protrude from the viral surface47. In the mosaic G protein, almost all functional sites directly related to host tropism and infectivity are located in the region derived from the carnivore RABV (positions 181 to 431 of the G protein). For example, neuroinvasiveness and receptor binding is known to be associated with lysine (Lys)48, 49 and arginine (Arg)20, 50 residues present at positions 330 and 333, respectively. In addition, a recent study suggested that positions 242, 255, and 268 affect the efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission of the viral infection51. Interestingly, we found that Arg333 of the carnivore RABV replaced Lys333 of the putative major parental strain, LAH60 (see Additional File 5).

In addition, the mosaic protein structure can also be estimated by studying the G protein of a bullet-shaped virus family member, vesicular stomatitis virus47 (Fig. 5B). Among the four functional domains of the mosaic G protein ectodomain (I, lateral domain; II, trimerization domain; III, pH domain; and IV, fusion domain), the parental bat RABV only provided domain IV (residues 53\u2013172, Fig. 5A), which mainly constitutes the stem of the hairpin conformation of the trimeric G protein (Fig. 5B). In contrast, almost all of domains I, II, and III are derived from the parental carnivore RABV (Fig. 5A), forming 84% of the G protein head (Fig. 5B). These domains are involved in receptor recognition and binding, response to pH changes, and G-protein trimerization47. It has been reported that mutations in the pH domain affect the structural transition of the G protein52 and therefore may alter the ability of RABV to escape antibody neutralization53 and to infect cells54.

The y-axis gives the percent identity between A09-0255 and two representatives of the parental lineages. (B) A bootscan plot of A09-0255 with a sliding window of 350 bp and a width of 20 bp using the complete G gene. The y-axis represents the percentage of permuted trees. Two Lagos bat viruses, 8619NGA and 0406SEN, were used as an outgroup. Analyses were performed using Simplot software. Vertical lines represent crossover sites. (C) Statistical analysis of the recombination event in the A09-0255 G gene using RDP 3.0. P-values of seven statistical methods implemented in RDP 3.0 to identify recombination are listed. (D) Analysis of informative sites for identification of potential recombination breakpoints. Three sites with maximum \u03c72 values are indicated by three vertical lines. The \u03c72 value and P-value of Fisher\u2019s exact test are shown near the vertical lines. The Lagos virus isolate 8619NGA is used as the outgroup.",
