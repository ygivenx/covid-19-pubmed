However, frequent diseases always result in huge economic loss to the grass carp cultivation industry. Of these diseases, grass carp hemorrhage disease caused by grass carp reovirus (GCRV) has been being noticed with special concern by fish breeding scientists with the hope of disease-resistant breeding. GCRV, belonging to the family Reoviridae, genus Aquareovirus [3], is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus reported mainly in China and could trigger apoptosis in C. idellus kidney (CIK) cells [4]. However, the mechanism of apoptosis induced by GCRV, which is critical for the defense of GCRV and virus-resistant breeding, remains unknown. The rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus), a Chinese native species belonging to the family Cyprinidae, could be infected by GCRV, resulting in an up to 100% mortality rate [5]. Moreover, due to its propagational biological characteristics, rare minnow has the potential to be used as a model fish in aquatic toxicity testing, chemical safety assessment, and virus-resistant breeding [6].",

Bid, BH3-interacting domain death agonist, is a pro-apoptotic BH3-only member of Bcl-2 family, serving as a key link in the amplification of various apoptosis signals other than the death receptor pathway [7, 8]. In the mitochondrial pathway, caspase-8 activated by death receptors pathway cleaves Bid and the truncated Bid (tBid) then translocates to the mitochondria. The BH3 domain of tBid can interact with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, including Bax and Bak, to mediate the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), leading the release of cytochrome c (cyt c) into cytosol with subsequent activation of apoptosis [7\u201313].",

            "text": "Interestingly, numerous studies in animal models demonstrated that Bid could be viewed as potential therapeutic target for some certain diseases. Suppression of hepatocyte Bid using an antisense approach could not only effectively attenuate the hepatocytes apoptosis induced by Glychochenodeoxycholate (GCDC), but also ameliorate liver injury in a mice model of extrahepatic cholestasis [14]. In hepatocellular-specific Bid deficient mice, their liver showed strong resistance to hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatotoxicity in comparison with controls, suggesting inhibition of Bid was critical for the resistance to the lethal effects of Fas activation in vivo [15]. In contrast to controls, an upregulation of Bid could be detected in septic shock patients, indicating pro-apoptotic gene Bid has great potential as a biomarker to monitor sepsis [16]. Bid-/- mice showed no lung injury after Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation [17]. Survival of Bid-deficient mice was significantly increased when compared with wild type mice after reovirus infection [7, 18]. However, there is limited knowledge of Bid in teleost fish, and the specific role of Bid during the virus-induced apoptosis in teleost fish is still unclear.",

In the present study, Bid genes from grass carp (CiBid) and rare minnow (GrBid) were cloned and analyzed. The expression pattern of CiBid among different tissues and the response to GCRV were studied in vivo. Furthermore, we examined the function of Bid using genetically deficient (Bid-/-) rare minnow. Our results suggested that the replication of GCRV and virus-triggered apoptosis were both suppressed in Bid-/- rare minnow in comparison with wild-type rare minnow. Our study provides new insight into understanding the GCRV induced apoptosis and suggests that Bid may be a target gene for virus-resistant breeding in grass carp.",

DNA isolated from the spleens were then subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Apoptosis is characterized by the activation of endogenous endonuclease, resulting in the digestion of chromatin and the formation of a ladder of fragments that were multiples of approximately 200 base pairs in length. As shown in Figure 1A, no or little detectable apoptotic DNA fragmentation was visualized by the DNA laddering assay in the mock-infected sample or early stage (1 and 3 dpi) of infected samples. However, obvious apoptotic DNA fragmentation was observed at the late stage of GCRV infection (5, 7, and 9 dpi). Moreover, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was also performed for kidney samples that collected at the same time points as above. In Figure 1B, fish kidney showed more apoptotic cells stained with by TUNEL asssy at 5, 7, and 9 dpi, identifying severe apoptosis happened at the late time points. Overall, these results strongly suggested that GCRV induced apoptosis in infected fish",

To be specific, expression level of CiCaspase-9 and CiCaspase-3 in intestine was decreased at first upon GCRV stimulation and then began to up-regulate significantly around 4 or 5 days post stimulation (Figure 4G and 4H). Nevertheless, CiCaspase-9 and CiCaspase-3 showed a different pattern in liver. Expression level of CiCaspase-9 and CiCaspase-3 almost up-regulated continuously in liver and reached the peak at 4 or 5 day post infection (Figure 4I and 4J). Anyway, the up-regulation CiCaspase-9 and CiCaspase-3 further suggested that GCRV-induced apoptosis occurred.",

As previously reported, mutations caused by Cas9 were largely predictable as the induced mutant loci were produced at a fixed target sequence [20]. The target sequence of GrBid (5\u2019-GGAGAAGCAGGGAACACTGA GG-3\u2019) was located at 27bp downstream of the translation start site (ATG) of Bid gene in rare minnow. Thus, mutation in the target sequence would result in the loss of function. The one-cell stage rare minnow embryos were injected with Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. PCR and sequencing results of the injected embryos showed that mutations were yielded in the GrBid target site (Figure 5A). The -10bp mutation was chosen for further study and the homozygous Bid-deficient rare minnow was obtained in finally. Moreover, RT-qPCR was carried out to confirm that CRISPR/Cas9 could induce loss-of-function mutation for Bid in rare minnow. Seven tissues (gill, spleen, intestine, heart, liver, brain, and muscle) were collected from Bid-deficient and wild-type fish. RNA was extracted and then reverse-transcribed to obtain cDNA for RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure 5B, no or very little expression level of Bid gene (CT value \u2265 33) was detected in Bid-deficient fish whereas expression level of Bid in wild-type fish was normal (CT value range from 23~26). These results further confirmed the generation of Bid-deficient rare minnow.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the overall expression level of Bid was down-regulated at the early phase of infection (1, 2, and 3 dpi) whereas up-regulated at the late phase (4, 5, and 6 dpi). At the early stage of virus infection, host cell apoptosis was inhibited by virus in order to facilitate the replication and spread of virus [30]. Thus, as a pro-apoptotic protein, mRNA expression level of Bid was down-regulated. However, the host could respond to virus infection and cell apoptosis occurred at the late stage as a self-protection mechanism to limit the spread of progeny virus [31]. Therefore, it is not surprising that the mRNA expression level of Bid was up-regulated at the late stage of infection. Similar expression pattern was also observed in other pro-apoptotic genes in grass carp [19, 32]. Moreover, the dynamic changes of GCRV copy number in infected grass carp was detected in our previously study [33]. Results showed that the relative copy number of GCRV (type II GCRV) was extremely low in 1 and 3 days post-infection, followed by a dramatic increase in 5 days post stimulation and a slight reduction in 7 days post infection. Obviously, the copy number of GCRV was consistent with the expression level of CiBid in some degree. Overall, the dynamics of GCRV copy number was associated with the expression level of CiBid. After GCRV infection, the expression of CiBid altered significantly in all examined tissues but the response was different among these tissues. The strong response was observed in liver, spleen, and kidney tissue. Previous study suggested that tissue tropism of GCRV was existed. The liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, and muscle of fish were more susceptible to GCRV and had a higher number of viral RNA copies [34]. Thus, the strong response in liver, spleen, and kidney tissue may be caused by higher virus titers in these tissues. Not only Bid, but also CiCaspase-9 and CiCaspase-3, were up-regulated upon GCRV infection. Previous studies have shown that both HIV-1 protease and HCV could activate procaspase-8, which was associated with subsequent events including cleavage of Bid, mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, and activation of the downstream effectors caspase-9 and caspase-3 [23, 35\u201337]. Hence, the up-regulation of CiBid, CiCaspase-9, and CiCaspase-3 implied that CiBid contributed to GCRV-induced apoptosis.",

Moreover, similar with grass carp, rare minnow is much more vulnerable to GCRV. Therefore, we selected rare minnow as a fish model for virus-resistant breeding program of grass carp. We successfully obtained Bid-/- rare minnow by use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, indicating this technique is feasible and valid in editing genes of rare minnow. In our study, following infection with GCRV, the median survival time of Bid-/- rare minnow was significantly delayed and the duration of death was extended. Bid-/- mice showed a certain degree of resistance to reovirus, but the resistance was in correlation with the virus dose and how it infected [7]. Therefore, we suspected that the survival rate of Bid-deficient rare minnow may be associated with the dose of GCRV we used. However, this hypothesis needs further confirmation. RT-qPCR showed that the copy number of virus in all examined tissues (gill, intestine, spleen, kidney, spleen, and brain) of Bid-/- rare minnow was lower at the early stage post infection (2 and 3 dpi) compared with the wild-type fish, but equivalent or even higher at the late phase of infection (5 dpi). In Bid-/- mouse model, the reovirus titers in intestine, liver, and heart were also lower than those in wild-type mice at the early stage of peroral inoculation, but equivalent at the late phase after infection [7]. When the mouse was infected via intracranial inoculation, there were no obvious differences in virus titers between wild-type and Bid-/- mouse [7]. Therefore, similar to mouse, Bid-/- rare minnow could reduce the efficiency of GCRV replication, but the reduction could be affected by virus dose.",

Moreover, as described before, the copy number of GCRV in Bid-/- rare minnow was lower at the early stage post infection (2 and 3 dpi) when compared with the wild-type fish. However, it is not clear whether the decreased replication efficiency of GCRV was a cause, or a result, of the reduced apoptosis. Because some virus could use apoptosis as a mechanism of virus spread; meanwhile, other viruses\u2019 successful replication relied on the ability of certain viral products (such as E1B-19K, IE1, and SPI-2) to block or delay apoptosis [38\u201340].

Following GCRV stimulation in vivo, CiBid and apoptosis related genes Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 were up-regulated significantly. Additionally, we use Bid-/- rare minnow as a model to investigate the possible role of Bid in regulating GCRV-triggered apoptosis. We found that Bid-deficient rare minnow delayed the GCRV replication and attenuated GCRV-induced apoptosis. Our study would provide new insight into understanding the GCRV induced apoptosis and may provide a target gene for virus-resistant breeding in grass carp.",

The homozygous F2 mutant progeny were selected for further study. To confirm the loss of Bid expression induced by CRISPR/Cas9 system, seven tissues (gill, spleen, intestine, heart, liver, brain, and muscle) were collected from five Bid-deficient rare minnows and wild-type rare minnows. RNA was extracted and then reverse-transcribed to obtain cDNA for RT-qPCR.",
