For this reason, we conducted a scoping review rather than a systematic review. The aim of the scoping review was to rapidly map the key concepts underpinning the research area using the main sources and types of evidence available (11). A scoping review can be used to address topics that are too broad for a systematic review, or have not been previously reviewed comprehensively (11). Although we did not use meta-analysis (an approach commonly used for systematic reviews), systematic review methods were used where possible to minimize bias in the identification and inclusion of the studies (12). The \u2018PPRR\u2019 continuum offered a preliminary framework which was used as a guide to identify the progress and challenges of disaster health management.",

First, in response to the 2003 SARS crisis, the government acted to improve the prevention and management of infectious diseases. These initiatives included the establishment of a national infectious disease surveillance system and independent infectious disease hospitals; improved isolation facilities in Emergency Departments (ED); the upgrading of the isolation wards; improved training and monitoring of hospital staff in infection-control procedures; and improved compliance with the use of personal protection equipment (13\u201315).",

Disaster-resilient infrastructure is a primary guarantee for health care organizations to maintain their functions during disasters; they achieve this outcome through their ability to resist and absorb disaster impacts on physical facilities. Resilient infrastructure includes not only physical strength but also back-up for the systems. However, no standard has been endorsed or enforced to ensure that healthcare facilities can resist natural disasters. In addition, back-up systems (e.g. electricity, water, and communication) were not fully considered when many hospitals were being built. For example the health facilities in the earthquake-prone areas of western and rural China rarely comply with the standards of construction, nor are their back-up systems required to resist natural disasters (23). The 2008 Sichuan earthquake caused the collapse of 67.5% of healthcare buildings in the worst affected areas (24). As a consequence, a large proportion of the county hospitals were destroyed or lost their critical systems. It is also noted that a number of the township hospitals and village clinics required temporary facilities to support their ongoing roles (25). Thus, in China, the low standard of disaster-resilient infrastructure is the first challenge to efficient disaster response (6).",

Moreover, the health facilities in many regions have a low level of essential preparedness in relation to disaster vulnerability analysis, disaster stockpiles, coordination with other institutions, emergency training in disaster first-aid, rescue, and the use of specialized supplies (13, 14, 27, 28). Western and rural area hospitals are even less prepared, having lower proportions of these essential preparedness aspects (24, 25, 29).",

However, there are still inadequate portable medical devices in China. As happened during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, an enormous amount of hospital equipment was unavailable in the hardest hit areas, with the larger equipment not being appropriate for onsite triage and treatment. Further, during this event, most of the rescue teams were not prepared; they did not have portable radiography machines or ultrasonography facilities (23). Such inadequacy may impede the ability of the rescue teams to provide first-line medical treatment during future natural disasters (31).",

The establishment of the triage criteria, based on the severity of the disaster and the availability of the health resources, is central to improving healthcare capacity during disasters (24, 33). A simple triage and rapid treatment (START) method was established after the Wenchuan earthquake to facilitate site triage and injury classification (33).

Instead, most hospitals have adopted disaster triage procedures from the general procedures used in ED (31, 33).",

However, Chinese disaster surge capacity still lags behind other countries such as the United States (28). As revealed by previous research, most secondary and tertiary hospitals in Beijing acknowledge they have insufficient surge (extra) beds to meet the demands during disasters, such as an infectious disease epidemic. The surge beds accounted for only 8.5% of all the fixed beds after the SARS crisis in 2004 (13). In 2012, only 65.9% of the tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province were able to surge patient-care beds, with the total surge capacity being 12.52%, within 24 hours (28). Two reasons were identified for this low surge capacity. First, there was a lack of a hospital surging plan that used flexible surging strategies during disasters (35, 36, 38\u201340). For instance, in 2012, only 53.7% of the tertiary hospitals in the Shandong Province had surging plans; only 36.6% of the hospitals adopted a variety of flexible procedures for surging their beds (e.g. through the early discharge of patients, the cancellation of elective admissions, or the transfer of patients). Second, the health system was already under increased pressure from the growing daily demand (9, 29, 41). This human resource shortage compounded the limited surge capacity of the hospitals during disasters. As noted earlier, during the 2008 earthquake, the local healthcare workers were overwhelmed by the large number and the severity of casualties (19).",

The first phase, the acute phase, occurs when general psychological counselling is used to reduce the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder. The second phase, the chronic phase, occurs when psychological interventions are focused on issues associated with depression (23). However, to date, few programs exist for the evaluation and identification of psychological problems (especially during the chronic phase) of the population in the disaster areas. As a result, the targeted interventions remain inadequate for the treatment of large numbers of victims with psychological problems (e.g. post-injury stress disease), or for victims with the potential for psychological problems that arise during disasters (43).",

Hence, the roles of hospital EDs and emergency service centers overlap in some large cities such as Beijing and Shenyang (18). Moreover, there is no official guideline, protocol, or legal standard for patient management and transfer between these two sectors. During disasters, the independence of these two sectors can lead to inefficiencies and the waste of valuable resources (18, 29).

This situation may effectively discourage hospitals from becoming involved in disaster preparedness (45). Without legal guarantees, few insurance companies will accept insurance for health staff working in the disaster areas (46). In addition, there is the need to have similar hospital command and control systems across hospitals in all responding sites, to ensure the maximum efficiency of mutual aid. However, to date, there is no such overarching command and control guideline to assist the different areas of China. This lack of legal clarification may impede the formulation of an integrated response system for disaster command, control and cooperation (47). Also, the responsibility and authority of the different levels of government, the army facilities, and the non-governmental organizations are not clearly defined within the law. For non-profit organizations this vagueness may cause chaos during disasters (23). For example, the 2013 Lushan earthquake highlighted the difficulties that can arise in the absence of a legal system to recruit and coordinate the volunteers. In that instance, the individual volunteers and unauthorized organizations entering the disaster area created road congestion and inadvertently, unnecessary casualties (19). Further, without the legal enforcement to release details to the public about the use of donations, embezzlement of some of the donations for the Wenchuan earthquake occurred. This event caused a credibility crisis for the public in regard to the donations given to the government-organized NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) (19).",

The funding gaps and the disparities in the distribution of funds present major challenges for healthcare organizations providing medical care during a disaster response (47). The first disparity occurs between the funding of urban and rural areas. For example, healthcare resources, modern healthcare facilities, and physicians are concentrated mainly in the urban areas while the rural areas are less well resourced (4, 29). There is also a tension between the allocation of resources for the immediate day-to-day needs and for disaster preparedness. In addition, investments that are put toward the improvement of emergency preparedness may compromise other more urgent programs such as primary healthcare in rural and western areas (4). In addition, most funding was used for the reimbursement of actual expenses after a disaster. The 2008 government finance report indicates that most government funding was used for the Wenchuan earthquake rescue (the central government invested 38.4 billion RMB, about US$6.28 billion), while the earthquake relief and preparedness funding amounted to 2.4 billion RMB (about US$0.4 billion). Finally, since the health system reforms were introduced in the 1980s, healthcare organizations have turned their attention to revenue-generating services (9). As a result, hospitals and professionals can be paid significantly more for their clinical services than their disaster-related work (9). Thus, without sufficient financial allocations the motivation of hospitals to improve their disaster preparedness is likely to remain low.",

When the disaster occurs the decisions about who and what to send to the disaster zone might be determined by dogma, rather than by scientific analysis (25). For instance, during natural disasters, a large number of search and rescue teams are dispatched to the disaster zones and part of the purpose of their role is moral inspiration (25). However, if there is an oversupply of search and rescue teams, the influx of too many teams may become a burden on the limited supplies for the victims, such as food, shelter, sanitation, and healthcare services (25). Occasionally, outside aid agencies have been known to rush manpower, equipment, and supplies to a disaster area regardless of the local requirements, and without coordination with the other local organizations\u2019 plans and resources; this situation may lead to the waste of resources and result in low efficiency (19, 25). For instance, during a disaster, supplies are delivered from the outside (such as clothes and foods); these donations can be useless as they are inappropriate for the current situation. Moreover, receiving these donations may cause a waste of valuable warehouse space and manpower. Also, because the source is unknown, the donated items may need to be sterilized properly, which uses even more resources (25).",

To enhance local disaster preparedness, multiple strategies need to be adopted. First, the local prioritized hazards need to be evaluated, while strict structural standards need to be enforced; these aspects are essential for reducing casualties from disasters (21, 48). For example, in the hardest hit area of the 2013 Lushan earthquake, 96.32% of the public buildings built after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake were still functional and able to be used. As a result, the new structural standards reduced the impact of the disaster on human health and wellbeing (19). Second, operational disaster plans for healthcare facilities need to be devised, in advance. In addition, they need to take into consideration the communities\u2019 resources, hazards and other unique factors (14, 49). Third, healthcare organizations need to have the capacity to be self-sufficient for the first 48 to 72 hours; this disaster coping capacity is essential as it may take this long for supplies to be delivered from the outside (32). Fourth, non-governmental mutual assistance, as well as a social insurance mechanism, needs to be strengthened to decrease the gap between the governmental funding and the actual costs of the disaster relevant work (49, 50). Finally, funds need to be allocated to local primary healthcare centers and hospitals to assist their roles in providing adequate capability as the first disaster responders (7).",

Nevertheless, some international surge strategies would appear to have the potential to be adapted into the Chinese disaster-planning environment. These surge strategies would include: providing staff with onsite accommodation, and the training of non-clinical staff to support the fully trained staff (51, 52), cancelling elective surgery in order to focus on critical care (51), triaging the resources, and providing patients with adjusted standards of healthcare during the period of the disaster (53, 54). Other strategies would include converting non-clinical areas for surging clinical space (prepared in advance, with available power, water, oxygen, equipment and telecommunication) (51, 55, 56); early discharge of stable inpatients or referring them to ancillary healthcare services (e.g. nursing homes and primary healthcare centers) (51, 55, 56); and obtaining cooperative agreements with other facilities and off-site hospitals (38, 51). Such considerations have the potential to assist the country to surge its capacity during times of disaster.",

Thus, appropriate education or training curricula need to be developed and implemented to address these issues in the long term (49). Such courses need to be available for hospital professionals as part of their ongoing professional development. Systematic and ongoing training of staff in disaster skills and equipment usage should be conducted in high-risk communities. For example, staff should be trained in how to triage a large number of patients and with limited resources. The training programs used in other countries could be implemented but with appropriate modification to fit the Chinese environment, as necessary. The American Medical Association has developed two courses that have this potential, but which are largely directed to the initial triage and management in the field and in the ED, namely the Basic Disaster Life Support course, and the Advanced Disaster Life Support course (20).",
