Sequencing results indicate that the YOKV genome is 10,857 nucleotides (nt) in total [8]. Like other flaviviruses, YOKV has only one open reading frame (ORF), which encodes 3425 amino acids. The genome encodes three structural proteins, the capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). There are 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding regions at the ends of the genome. Molecular genetic analysis indicated that YOKV is a new member of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [8]. Furthermore, YOKV is genetically related to other flaviviruses, including Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus. YOKV is closely related to yellow fever virus, which both clustered in the same clade [8]. Additionally, YOKV was neutralized by antisera to individuals inoculated with yellow fever virus vaccine. The above results suggested that this new member of flavivirus is genetically related to yellow fever virus. A serological survey of YOKV in the Philippines and Malaysia showed that the YOKV antibody was detected in the serum of bats (Rousettus leschenaultii), suggesting that the distribution of YOKV was not limited to Yokosuka Island, Japan [9] (Fig. 1).",

This virus was identified as a YOKV in the genus Flavivirus based on phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 3). However, some clear differences between XYBX1332 and the original strain of YOKV (Oita-36) were identified as following.1) As mentioned above, the genome length of Oita-36 (including the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs) is 10,857 nt, while that of XYBX1332 is 10,785 nt. 2) The coding region of Oita-36 is 10,275 nt, which encodes 3425 amino acids; The coding region of XYBX1332 is 10,266 nt, which encodes 3422 amino acids (Table 4). 3) The two viruses of ORF region exhibited 72 and 82% nucleotide and amino acid homology, respectively.4) The lengths of the 5\u2032-UTR for XYBX1332 and Oita-36 are 124 and 150 nt, respectively, while those of the 3\u2032-UTR are 395 and 432 nt, respectively. The homology of the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR sequences between the two strains was determined to be 81.5 and 78.3%, respectively (Table 5).5) It is only 74% of the nucleotide homology in the 3\u2019end of NS5 gene between XYBX1332 virus and Oita-36 virus (Table 4), which is much lower than cut-off (84%) of that between species of Flavivirus[17]. These results suggested that, although XYBX1332 is a YOKV based on phylogenetic analysis, it may be a new virus in Flavivirus. Furthermore, the cross-neutralization test between XYBX1332 virus and Oita-36 virus would be conducted by the antigenicity between the viruses to confirm whether the XYBX1332 virus is a new species in Flavivirus.",

After years of monitoring, a large number of recombinant coronaviruses were discovered in bats, further suggesting that bats may be the host animal for SARS [23].
