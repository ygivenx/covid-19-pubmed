In developing countries, vaccination is sometimes not a viable option, due to a lack of infrastructure (cold chain and transportation), hampering the availability of vaccines; a lack of technically trained personnel; the cost of the vaccine; and the need for readministration. Other solutions must be found in order to control this disease (1). In these countries, virulent NDV can cause mortality at rates as high as 80% among village flocks (2). Ameliorating the negative impacts of NDV would reduce hunger, strengthen food security, alleviate poverty, and, since chickens are traditionally a woman's responsibility, promote gender equality in developing countries (3).",

The strains of NDV are divided into three major categories ranging from low to high virulence: lentogenic, mesogenic, and velogenic (8). The intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) is used to differentiate and classify NDV according to its virulence (8), which is largely determined by the F protein cleavage site (9). Although the strains differ in their virulence, all belong to the same serotype, thus enabling the use of lentogenic viruses as vaccines for protection against the more virulent strains. Although infections by lentogenic strains are rare, clinical signs associated with infections by lentogenic strains are nonspecific and include ruffled feathers, anorexia, decreased egg production, and respiratory infection in birds with a compromised immune system (5, 6, 10).",

Previous studies have compared gene expression levels in response to infection with multiple NDV strains and in host tissues measured from quantitative PCR (qPCR) and microarray data and reported different cytokine expression levels dependent on the strain causing the infection (11\u201315). Gene expression analyses performed on tracheal epithelial cells following NDV infection in vitro showed a strong innate immune response (16). The trachea is one of the first tissues that NDV encounters when it is transmitted by the aerosol route and a critical site of the host-pathogen interaction. All strains of NDV are able to replicate in the epithelial cells of the trachea (17), and challenges with either lentogenic or velogenic strains resulted in comparable viral titers in the trachea (18).",

In the current study, two diverse, inbred chicken lines, the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines, were utilized to identify genetic mechanisms of resistance to NDV. Several studies have compared the immune responses of these two lines. Chickens of the Fayoumi line were found to be relatively resistant to Salmonella, Eimeria, Marek's disease, and avian influenza virus (AIV) compared to those of the Leghorn line (26\u201329). Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from these two lines showed increased phagocytic ability, nitric oxide production, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II surface expression (30). Here the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines were used as a discovery platform to identify mechanisms of resistance to NDV. We hypothesized that the Fayoumis are more resistant to NDV, as shown by a lower viral load and a higher antibody titer. The term \u201cresistance,\u201d as used in the current study, is defined as the ability of the host to interfere with the pathogen life cycle (31). The term resistance in this context is not absolute; therefore, the host may still become infected and succumb to infections caused by virulent NDV strains. Comparison of the two lines' responses to NDV may designate genes/pathways associated with the resistance of the Fayoumi line. The information generated by this study will be beneficial for vaccine development and other control strategies.",

The gene for protein kinase C beta (PRKC\u03b2) was the only gene that was uniquely identified to be DE only in the Fayoumis at all three time points.

At 6 dpi there were only 119 DEG for the Fayoumis to populate the pathways, making it more difficult to obtain significance for activation or inhibition of a pathway. Several key pathways were significantly activated at all time points in both lines: iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-\u03baB signaling, the role of the nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells.

This study predicted the enrichment of immune cells in the trachea in challenged birds of both lines at all times. One pathway that was instrumental in leukocyte migration was leukocyte extravasation signaling. On the basis of the expression of genes within this pathway, IPA predicted the activation of actin cytoskeleton contraction and cell mobility. A previous study examining gene expression levels in the lung after challenge with AIV in the same experimental lines showed an upregulation of actin filament-based movement in the Fayoumis (29). Actin cytoskeleton activation is crucial for cell migration, as leukocytes use actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction for movement. Notably, paramyxoviruses like NDV also require actin to replicate efficiently (32, 33). If the migrating cells become infected with the virus, a conundrum may be created for the host. In one study, there was a downregulation of actin-related genes after challenge with NDV in vitro (34). Due to challenge with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the proteins involved in cytoskeleton organization differed in expression in the trachea depending on IBV virulence (35). The host must find a way to balance the costs and benefits of cytoskeleton upregulation with defense against viral infection. The regulation of cytoskeleton- and actin-related genes may be time dependent and may be a critical target for future study.",

The use of two unique inbred lines that differ in their relative resistance offered a valuable tool for comparison. Fayoumis had significantly less detectable virus at 2 dpi (measured by RNA-seq) and 6 dpi (measured by qPCR), which may result in faster viral clearing and which, overall, supports their relatively resistant phenotype compared to the phenotype of the Leghorns. A decreased viral load corresponds to less viral shedding and, therefore, fewer viral particles in the environment and a lower transmission potential (36). In a separate study with the same two genetic lines, although all birds succumbed to infection with velogenic NDV, the mean survival time was longer for the Fayoumis than the Leghorns at all four doses tested and was significantly longer at the two higher doses (P. Miller and C. Afonso, SEPRL, Athens, GA, personal communication, 2016).",

The current study identified several genes whose expression levels were impacted significantly by both line and challenge (Table 2), and some of these overlapped those from a previous study.

This study has demonstrated the Fayoumis' classification as being relatively resistant to NDV compared to the Leghorns, as determined by viral load and viral sequence counts and suggested by antibody titers and DEG numbers. This study identified possible mechanisms for the Fayoumis' resistance, including the downregulation of collagen and the increased activation of eIF2 signaling, which can be used to improve vaccine development and highlight genes for which beneficial genetic variance can be used to inform breeding decisions. Cytokine expression levels are time, tissue, and strain dependent (11\u201313). It is critical that future breeding decisions be made from data from studies with multiple tissues, host genetic backgrounds, NDV strains, and time points. The current study is a first step in understanding and identifying possible mechanisms of resistance to NDV. Future studies to examine the gene expression of Fayoumis and Leghorns challenged with velogenic NDV are necessary to better determine the applicability of the results presented here.",

For consistency, the adapter sequence and the individual multiplexing index were removed from all samples using the FASTX Clipper program. In addition, FASTX removed any sequence less than 30 bp in length and filtered each read such that 80% of all base pairs within a read had a Phred quality score of 30 or higher.
