Pneumonia accounts for 15% of all deaths of children <5 years of age and is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. In HIV-uninfected children, pneumococcal infection is responsible for around 11% of all deaths in this age group [1]. Nearly, 1 in 500 children under the age of 5 years is hospitalised each year with CAP [2]. However, only 54% of children with symptoms of pneumonia are taken outside the home for care [3]. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1]. There are signs of progress in the 75 countries included in \u2018Countdown to 2015\u2019 [3]. In this group, the number of deaths from pneumonia in children under 5 has declined from 21% in 2000 to 16% in 2015 [3]. Nonetheless, CAP remains an issue of profound economic and social importance to children and communities worldwide.",

            "text": "\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is widely considered to be the leading cause of CAP, though proportions vary by region. It is responsible for about one-third of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children aged <2 years. S. pneumoniae is commonly found in asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage. The asymptomatic carriage state is responsible for much of the transmission within populations, such as day-care centres [4]. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a major pathogen, though proportions vary regionally and with vaccine coverage [5]. Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae is considered an atypical bacterial pneumonia because of its different course, radiological findings and treatment. Active population-based surveillance for CAP was undertaken in hospitals in three American cities [6]. The annual incidence of hospitalisation for pneumonia was 15.7 cases per 10,000 children (95% CI 14.9\u201316.5). The annual incidence of M. pneumoniae was 1.4/10,000 (95% CI 1.2\u20131.6) and of S. pneumoniae was 0.5/10,000 (95% CI 0.4\u20130.6) [6]. Less commonly, severe infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, especially following influenza. Fungal infection by Pneumocystis jiroveci (PJP) is particularly important in young children with AIDS. Furthermore, children with milder atypical pathogens may recover without antibiotic intervention. Causative pathogens also vary with age. Overall, viruses alone are a cause in younger children, in up to 50%. When a bacterial cause is found in older children, it is most commonly S. pneumoniae, followed by M. pneumoniae [7].",

Since both fast-breathing and chest-indrawing pneumonias were now best treated with amoxicillin, classifications were also revised. The new classification was revised to include only two categories of pneumonia: \u2018pneumonia\u2019 with fast breathing and/or chest indrawing, which requires home therapy with oral amoxicillin, and \u2018severe pneumonia\u2019, pneumonia with any general danger sign, which requires referral and injectable antibiotic therapy.",

Several low-quality studies found a reduction in fever duration but the clinical impact of this effect was unclear.

PCR/electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry and whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis was used to identify serotypes, resistance features, genotypes, and pilus types. PCV13 targeted all major 19A and 7F genotypes, and decreased antimicrobial resistance, primarily owing to removal of the 19A/ST320 complex. The strain complex contributing most to the remaining \u03b2-lactam resistance during 2011\u20132013 was 35B/ST558. Significant emergence of non-vaccine clonal complexes was not evident. Because of the removal of vaccine serotype strains, positivity for one or both pilus types (PI-1 and PI-2) decreased in the post-PCV13 years 2011\u20132013 relative to 2008\u20132009 (decreases of 32\u201355% for PI-1, and > 95% for PI-2 and combined PI-1 + PI-2). Beta-lactam susceptibility phenotypes correlated consistently with transpeptidase region sequence combinations of the three major penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) determined through WGS analysis. Other major resistance features were predictable by DNA signatures from WGS analysis. Multilocus sequence data combined with PBP combinations identified progeny, serotype donors and recipient strains in serotype switch events. PCV13 decreased the frequency of all PCV13 serotype clones and concurrently decreased the frequency of strain subsets with resistance and/or adherence features conducive to successful carriage [38].",

Recent systematic reviews support the 2014 recommendations and no new trial evidence counters this view. This review has not focussed on recent aetiology studies, or other data on advances in molecular diagnostics (e.g. pneumococcal DNA load) predicting viral or bacterial respiratory infection. A number of CAP amoxicillin trials are underway comparing varying dose and duration regimens, although there has been limited harmonisation as yet of study design. Not all of these trials may be relevant to the LMIC setting. Few trials as yet are including AMR outcomes, making assessment of optimal treatment recommendations at a population level from an AMR perspective currently not possible. There is a major need for further trials to determine the overall optimal duration of treatment of hospitalised children with severe and very severe pneumonia. The optimal choice of antibiotic for oral step-down regimens is also unclear, specifically amoxicillin compared to agents that treat staphylococcal infection (such as amoxicillin clavulanate).",
