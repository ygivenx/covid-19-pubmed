We purified USP14 and USP14(C114A) and their glutathione S-transferase (GST)-conjugated counterparts [GST-USP14 and GST-USP14(C114A), respectively] using previously described methods7, with some modifications. Cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, and when the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) was 0.6\u20130.8, we added IPTG to each culture (final concentration of 1 mM), and allowed cultures to incubate overnight at 25 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor cocktails and lysed by sonication. Following centrifugation, lysates were filtered and supernatants incubated with GST sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, GST-USP14 was eluted using 10 mM reduced glutathione (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0). The GST tag was removed by incubating protein fractions with thrombin in a cleavage buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol] for 3 h at room temperature (RT). After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated with benzamidine sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) to remove any residual thrombin. Purified GST (data not shown), GST-USP14, GST-USP14(C114A), USP14, and USP14(C114A) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) to determine the size and purity of proteins (Fig. 1A).",

Briefly, the aptamer library template DNA (5\u2032-GGG TTC ACT GCA GAC TTG ACG AAG CTT -40 N-A ATG GAT CCA CAT CAT CTA CGA ATT C-3\u2032) was generated by PCR using a forward primer (5\u2032-GAT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GTT CAC TGC AGA CTT GAC GAA-3\u2032) containing the T7 promoter sequence (underlined) and a reverse primer (5\u2032-TTA CCT AGG TGT AGA TGC TTA AG-3\u2032) (Fig. 1B). The RNA aptamer library was prepared using T7 RNA polymerase in in vitro transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 5 mM DTT, and 2 mM NTPs) at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Products were treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, subjected to 12% denaturing urea PAGE using, and purified from gels. A 6-\u03bcg aliquot of each generated RNA pool was incubated with 100 \u03bcL of GST sepharose 4B resin in binding buffer [30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)] for 30 min at RT with occasional shaking. The RNA-bead complexes were transferred to porous centrifuge columns (Pierce), and RNA pools that were unbound to sepharose resin were collected by centrifugation. The same procedure was performed using 2 \u03bcg of GST proteins to remove RNAs that were nonspecifically bound to GST or glutathione resin. During each round of selection, GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 6 \u03bcg of pre-cleared RNA pools in 100 \u03bcL of binding buffer for 30 min at RT, and then with 100 \u03bcL of GST sepharose 4B resin for an additional 30 min at RT. The quantity of GST-tagged proteins was gradually decreased (2 \u03bcg, rounds 2\u20138; 1 \u03bcg, round 9; 0.5 \u03bcg, rounds 10\u201311; 0.25 \u03bcg, rounds 12\u201313; and 0.125 \u03bcg, rounds 14\u201315) to achieve more stringent conditions. The RNA-GST-USP14 complexes were then washed three times with PBS, and eluted with 20 mM glutathione in binding buffer. Eluted RNAs were purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, reverse-transcribed with AccuPower RT PreMix (Bioneer), and amplified by PCR. The amplified cDNA was purified using the AccuPrep Gel purification kit (Bioneer) and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase for the next round of selection (Fig. 1C).",

We used recombinant USP14 proteins and vme-proteasomes for hydrolysis of Ub-rho110, a highly sensitive fluorogenic substrate of DUBs. In the absence of vme-proteasomes, USP14 exhibited little deubiquitinating activity. In contrast, USP14 was activated in the presence of vme-proteasomes, exhibiting higher Ub-rho110 hydrolysis activity than for vme-proteasomes alone (Fig. 2D). The addition of USP14-1, USP14-2, or USP14-3 to the reaction resulted in a decrease in USP14 deubiquitinating activity (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. 1). Inhibition of deubiquitinating activity by USP14 aptamers was specific to USP14, with the USP14-3 aptamer failing to inhibit the DUB activity of UCHL3, USP47, USP5, and UCHL5/UCH37 (Fig. 2E). USP14-3 inhibited USP14 deubiquitinating activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. 2). The catalytically inactive mutant of USP14, USP14(C114A), exhibited little deubiquitinating activity and was unaffected by the USP14 aptamers (Fig. 2D,F), indicating that the USP14 aptamers specifically inhibit USP14 DUB activity.",

Proteasomes that were not treated with Ub-vme showed significant deubiquitinating activity, possibly from USP14 and UCH37, another proteasomal DUB that interacts with RPN133 (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. 4). The enzymatic redundancy between these two enzymes on the proteasome is unclear, but is considered insignificant because UCH37 exhibits much weaker Ub hydrolysis activity than USP147. Addition of the USP14 aptamers strongly inhibited proteasome-mediated Ub-rho110 hydrolysis (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. 4). USP14-3 showed the strongest inhibitory activity for all tested proteasome concentrations. The strong inhibition exhibited by USP14-3 could be a result of its ability to simultaneously bind to UCH37 (data not shown). This would indicate that UCH37 plays a more significant role in deubiquitinating polyubiquitinated substrates than previously thought3. Further study is required to determine whether chain-trimming by UCH37 can suppress proteasome activity as effectively as USP14. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that USP14 RNA aptamers block the activity of USP14 and proteasomal DUBs.",

We previously reported that inhibition of USP14\u2019s Ub-chain trimming effects might enhance the proteolytic activities of proteasomes in vitro and in vivo7. To explore the possibility that inhibitory USP14 aptamers might enhance proteasome activity, we used suc-LLVY-AMC, a fluorogenic reporter substrate of 26S proteasomes. The fluorescent intensity as a result of suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis gradually increased over time (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 5). Proteasomal activity was higher when the USP14 RNA aptamers were present than when control aptamers were used, indicating that inhibiting USP14 with an RNA aptamer results in facilitated proteasomal degradation. Potentially USP14 aptamers inhibit USP14 by preventing its docking on the proteasome. However, direct pulldown assays indicated that the scenario is negative (Fig. 3B), indicating that the inhibitory effect by the RNA aptamer is mainly on USP14\u2019s DUB activity.",

The resulting Ub-Sic1 was gradually degraded when purified proteasomes were added. Addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 mutant protein in the reaction delayed Ub-Sic1 degradation (Fig. 3C). Mixing purified proteasomes with catalytically inactive recombinant USP14(C114A) facilitated the degradation of Ub-Sic1. In the control reaction, approximately 70% of Ub-Sic1 proteins were degraded by proteasomes after 10 min. However, in the presence of USP14 aptamers, Ub-Sic1 was almost completely degraded under the same conditions, showing similar kinetics for proteasomal degradation as USP14(C114A) was added in the reaction.

Tau proteins are thought to be degraded by the UPS, especially during the early phases of tauopathy or AD progression30. In the human AD brain, proteasome activity is impaired28, and might be related to the age-dependent decrease of proteasome activity. However, it could also be the consequence of an accumulation of tau protein. To verify that proteasome activation by USP14 aptamers facilitates tau degradation, we prepared Ub-tau. The ability of proteasomes to degrade Ub-tau was enhanced in the presence of the USP14 aptamers (Fig. 3D,E). These results strongly suggest that inhibition of USP14 by RNA aptamers might antagonize Ub chain-trimming on proteasomes, consequently facilitating the degradation of many UPS substrates.",

The effect of the USP14 aptamers on the proteasomal degradation of tau was examined using a HEK293-derived cell line expressing the longest isoform of human tau (htau40) upon induction with doxycycline25. These cells expressed htau40 in a dose-dependent manner and produced SDS-resistant tau aggregates after about 2 days in culture31. When USP14-3 aptamers were transfected into cells, the levels of induced tau proteins were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). The turnover of tau protein was facilitated by USP14-3 aptamers, as shown in our CHX chase analysis (Fig. 4C,D). Under those conditions, tau mRNA levels were comparable (Fig. 4E), indicating that accelerated tau degradation occurs post-translationally. The USP14 aptamers reduced cytotoxicity, which was induced by oxidative stress, in the presence of induced tau (Fig. 4F). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the protective effects of USP14 aptamers. These results indicate that USP14 aptamer-induced proteasome activation might protect cells under various stressful conditions, including neurodegeneration. Future work is necessary to determine whether the RNA aptamers we identified can delay the formation of tau aggregates in the mouse brain.",

In vitro assays using Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau with USP14 aptamers (Fig. 3C,D) indicated that elevated proteasomal activity might be due to catalytically inhibiting Ub chain-trimming of the proteasome substrate. The effects of USP14 aptamers on in vitro Ub degradation were more prominent when proteasomes were saturated with recombinant USP14 than when they were not. The different responses of Ub-Sic1 and Ub-tau to USP14 aptamers suggests that chain-trimming may not be a universal mechanism for regulating the rate of protein turnover. The weak response of tau proteins to USP14 inhibition suggests that their Ub chains have a higher binding affinity to the 26S proteasome compared with those of Sic123. The USP14 aptamers enhance proteasomal degradation; however, it remains to be determined what features of Ub substrates, or whether the geometric morphology of polyUb chains affects degradation.",

This enhanced proteasome-mediated removal of oxidized proteins, and protected cells against cardiac proteinopathy and myocardial ischemia3637. In the current study, we observed that inhibiting USP14 with specific aptamers did not appear to alter proteasome levels, but alleviated tau- and paraquat-induced cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that enhanced proteasome activity can have a beneficial effect on cell viability under conditions of general proteotoxic stress.

(1) Purified RNAs were incubated with GST-USP14. (2) USP14-RNA complexes were captured by glutathione agarose beads. (3) Unbound RNA molecules were removed by centrifugation. (4) USP14-RNA complexes were dissociated with elution buffer containing excess imidazole. (5) RNAs bound to USP14 were prepared by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Recovered RNAs were reverse transcribed, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro transcribed. (6) Following 15 rounds of selection, the resultant cDNA was amplified and cloned into pcDNA 3.1. (D) Human proteasomes (PTSM) were purified from \u03b24-tagged HEK293 cell lines. Some of the proteasomes were treated with 1 \u03bcM ubiquitin-vinylmethylester (Ub-vme) to yield vme-PTSMs. PTSMs (1 \u03bcg) and vme-PTSMs (1 \u03bcg) were separated on 12% gradient gels and stained with CBB.
