            "text": "Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope by budding from the host cell. In this process, viral envelope proteins gather at a special membranous structure and cooperate with other viral components to induce budding [1]. For example, some viruses including human immunodeficiency virus bud from the plasma membrane and release the virion from host cells by pinching-off. Others are budding at intracellular membranes [2], [3]. In this way, virions are wrapped within intracellular membrane-bound compartments, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, and the newly budded viruses exit the cell by using the cellular secretory pathway [2]. However, the detailed mechanisms of viral assembly and budding, especially the host factors that are involved in these processes, are yet to be revealed for many viruses. In this study, we report that interaction between coronavirus membrane protein (M) and actin with functional implication in facilitating virion assembly and budding.",

The avian coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the third group of coronaviruses genus. Like many other coronavriuses, IBV virion is built from four structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein with which the genomic RNA is packed, the spike (S) protein that forms the prominent coronavirus spikes, the M protein which is the most abundant component of coronavirus, and the envelope (E) protein which is a minor but yet critical component in virion assembly [4]. Some group II coronaviruses also encode an additional structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE).",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are known to assemble and bud at membranes of the intermediate compartment (IC), locating between the ER and Golgi complex [5]. The M protein is a type III membrane protein and a key player in coronavirus assembly. It spans the membrane bilayer three times, leaving a short amino-terminal domain on the virion exterior surface (or exposed luminally in intracellular membranes) and a large carboxy-terminal tail in the virion interior (or in the plasma) [6]. Lateral interactions between M proteins are thought to mediate the formation of the virion envelope [7]. When expressed alone, M protein accumulates in the Golgi complex in the form of homomultimeric complexes [8], [9]. However, in combination with the E protein, M is retained in the budding compartment and incorporated into virus-like particles (VLPs) with similarity in size and shape to authentic virions, demonstrating that the M and E proteins are the minimal requirements for envelope formation for most coronaviruses, [10]. The M protein appears to interact with S and HE proteins, and the S-M-HE protein complexes can be detected in cells infected with the bovine coronavirus [6]. The M protein was also shown to interact with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nucleocapsid consisting of the genomic-size mRNA 1 and N protein in a pre-Golgi compartment, probably at the ER membrane. It may interact directly with the genomic RNA through the packaging signal, initiating the M-nucleocapsid interaction [11]. There is also a detectably direct interaction between M and N proteins in the nucleocapsid, which may further stabilize the M-genomic RNA interaction [11].",

It polymerizes in a helical fashion to form actin filaments (or microfilaments) that form the cytoskeleton, a three-dimensional network inside a eukaryotic cell. Actin filaments provide mechanical support for the cell, determine the cell shape, enable cell movements (through lamellipodia, filopodia, or pseudopodia), and participate in certain cell junctions, in cytoplasmic streaming and in cell contraction during cytokinesis [13].",

The interaction was subsequently confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 in the M protein abolished the interaction. Introduction of the A159-K160 mutation into an infectious IBV clone system showed no infectious virus could be recovered, although viral RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription were detected. Furthermore, treatment of the infected cells with cell-permeable agent cytochalasin D at early, but not late, stages of the replication cycle showed no release of the virion to the cultured media, suggesting that disruption of actin filaments might block virion assembly and budding.",

However, as no suitable antibodies against actin were readily available at the time, the identity of this protein was not established. This issue was revisited in this study. Confluent monolayers of Vero cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 2 PFU/cell. The supernatants were collected at 18 hours post-infection and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes to remove cell debris. The virus particles were spun down by ultracentrifugation through a 2 ml sucrose cushion (20%), and purified using a 10\u201350% sucrose gradient. Following ultracentrifugation, 11 fractions were collected from top to bottom, and the presence of viral proteins was checked by Western blot with anti-N antibodies, showing that the IBV N protein was detected in fractions 7\u201311 with majority of the protein located in fractions 8\u201310 (Fig. 1, top panel). Analysis of the same fractions by Western blot with anti-actin antibodies showed that actin appeared in the same fractions as N protein, with the majority of the protein detected in fractions 8\u201310 (Fig. 1, middle panel). Fractionation of total lysates from cells without IBV infection under the same conditions showed that actin was mainly detected in fractions 3\u20134 (Fig. 1, bottom panel). These results demonstrate that actin could indeed be co-purified with the virus particles. However, it is currently uncertain if actin could be incorporated into the virions.",

The forward primer (5\u2032-ACTTAAGATAGATATTA A-3\u2032) used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from nucleotides 26\u201346 in the genomic RNA and the downstream primer (5\u2032-CTCTGGATCCAATAACCTAC-3\u2032) covers the IBV sequence from nucleotides 24784 to 24803. If transcription of subgenomic mRNAs occurs, a 415 bp PCR product corresponding to the 5\u2032-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA4 would be detected. As shown in Fig. 5a, a dominant 415 bp was observed in cells electroporated with wild type full-length transcripts at two time points (lower panel, lanes 2 and 5). In cells transfected with M\u03945 and Mm1 transcripts, a much weaker band was detected in cells transfected with the two mutant transcripts at 24 hours post-transfection (Fig. 5a, lower panel, lanes 3\u20134). Similarly to the results described above, the amounts of the subgenomic RNA 4 fragment detected from cells transfected with M\u03945 and Mm1 transcripts were increased approximately 3 to 5 fold, respectively, at 72 hours post-transfection based on real time PCR assay (Fig. 5a, lower panel, lanes 3\u20134 and 6\u20137). As a negative control, no detection of the amplified fragments was obtained from a mixture of RNA templates containing the in vitro transcribed RNA and total RNA extracted from mock infected cells (Fig. 5a, lower panel, lane 1).",

H1299 cells are a continuous cell line derived from human lung carcinoma. This cell line can be efficiently infected by the Vero cell-adapted IBV [17] and is much more resistant to the vaccinia virus-induced morphological changes. At 16 hours post-transfection, the cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 0.5 PFU/cell, and were harvested at 24 hours post-infection. The expression of M protein and the infectivity of IBV on these cells were analyzed by Western blot with anti-M and anti-N polyclonal antibodies, respectively (Fig. 5b). In cells transfected with both wild type and M\u03945 constructs with or without IBV infection, detection of similar amounts of M protein was observed (Fig. 5b, top two panels, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that both constructs were expressed at similar efficiencies. However, much more N protein was detected in the infected cells transfected with wild type M construct than that in cells transfected with the M\u03945 mutant (Fig. 5b, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2). As a loading control, similar amounts of actin were detected in cells transfected with both constructs (Fig. 5b, bottom panel). These results confirm that expression of the A159-K160 deletion M protein significantly reduces the infectivity of IBV, suggesting that expression of this mutant protein could inhibit the production of infectious virus in a dominant-negative manner.",

Confluent monolayers of Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 3 PFU/cell. At 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 hours post-infection, either 12.5 \u00b5g/ml of cytochalasin D or equal volume of DMSO was added to the cells. The supernatants and cell pellets were separately harvested at 24 hours post-infection and the presence of IBV N protein was checked by Western blot with anti-N antibodies. Typical N protein profiles, including the full-length and posttranslationally modified forms of the protein, were detected in the total cell lysates (Fig. 6, top panel). In cells treated with cytochalasin D, slightly less amounts of the N protein were detected when cytochalasin D was added to the cells at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hours post-infection, respectively (Fig. 6, top panel, lanes 1\u20134). No obvious difference in the expression of N protein was seen when cytochalasin D was added at 16 hours post-infection (Fig. 6, top panel, lane 5). Western blot analysis of actin was included as a loading control (Fig 6, middle panel). Analysis of the N protein in the clarified supernatants showed the detection of a single N protein species that represents the N protein incorporated into the virion particles in cells treated with DMSO alone (Fig. 6, bottom panel, lanes 6\u201310). In supernatants collected from cells treated with cytochalasin D, much reduced amounts of the N protein were detected in cells treated with the reagent at 12 and 16 hours post-infection, respectively (Fig. 6, bottom panel, lanes 4 and 5). No N protein was detected in supernatants harvested from cells treated with cytochalasin D at 0, 4 and 8 hour post-infection, respectively (Fig. 6, bottom panel, lanes 1\u20133).",

However, with the help of E protein, VLPs may be formed at the IC membranes. As coronaviruses do not contain a matrix protein that underlines the membrane, the M protein may serve as a matrix-like protein. It is proposed that the formation of coronavirus envelope is dominated by lateral interaction between M molecules that form a two-dimensional lattice in intracellular membranes [20]. The M-M interaction is essential but not sufficient for coronavirus envelope assembly. Free energy is needed to generate and stabilize membrane curvature, suggesting that interaction of M protein with host proteins would be a must [21]. To support this speculation, the results present in this study demonstrate that interaction of the IBV M protein with \u03b2-actin is essential for virion assembly and budding. The interacting region in the M protein was pinpointed by deletion and mutation studies. As M\u03943 is able to interact with actin, but M\u03941 and M\u03942 could not, it was reasoned that the domain responsible for this interaction may be located in the region covering amino acids 159\u2013160. This region was chosen for further deletion and mutational analysis, confirming that it is indeed involved in the interaction with actin. However, the two amino acids are not conserved in other coronavirus M proteins. At present, we do not know whether interaction between coronavirus M protein and actin is a general phenomenon for all coronaviruses, or is just IBV-specific.",

Actin has been identified in many enveloped viruses, such as Rous sarcoma virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, Sendai virus and measles virus. In the case of measles virus, actin was originally thought as a cellular contaminant, but was later demonstrated to be an internal component of the virus [23]\u2013[25]. Actin was found in the purified paramyxovirus particles and actin filaments were seen in association with the budding virions by electron microscopy [24]\u2013[26]. Polymerized actin was also found in HIV preparations [27], [28]. The functional implication for the incorporation of actin into these virus particles remains unclear. One possibility is that actin polymerization serves as an additional force for membrane bending during budding [1], [29]. As an illustrative example, actin was shown to control the movement of measles virus envelope proteins on the surface of infected cells [30].",

            "text": "Interaction of actin with viral components was also reported in several other viral systems. One example is the interaction of the nuclocapsids of murine mammary tumor virus with actin, which was required for extruding the virus particles from virus-infected cells [31]. The M protein of Newcastle disease virus could interact with actin in vitro [1], [32]. The SARS-CoV N protein could aggregate elongation factor 1\u03b1 through direct interaction, leading to the inhibition of protein translation and cytokinesis by blocking F-actin bundling [33]. It was also reported that the SARS-CoV N protein could induce apoptosis and actin reorganization in mammalian cells under stress conditions [34]. The results shown in this study demonstrate that actin could be co-purified with IBV virions and that the IBV M protein is associated with actin, suggesting that actin is likely to be incorporated into IBV virions through its interaction with the M protein. However, more conclusive data, such as immunogold labeling of highly purified virions, are currently lacking. It is interesting that IBV replication cycle was disturbed in cells treated with cytochalasin D. Cytochalsin D could prevent actin from polymerization, leading to malfunction of actin. When actin was disrupted, much less IBV virions were released from the cells into the culture medium, demonstrating that actin plays a very important role in the IBV replication cycle. Two possible mechanisms were considered. First, actin may be involved in the formation of the M lattice that may promote and stabilize its curving, resulting in the enhancement of some late processes, such as virion budding and release. Second, the MHV M protein was shown to be recycled from the Golgi complex back to early compartments, such as the ER and IC, which are functionally important in coronavirus infected cells [21]. Therefore, interaction of actin with M protein may help the retrograde transport of M protein from Golgi apparatus to some early compartments and provide more M protein for virion assembly and budding.",

Firstly, the monomers of M could interact with each other particularly via the transmembrane domains [21]. Besides, the M-N interaction region was narrowed to the 16 residues adjacent to the carboxy terminus of TGEV M protein [40]. However, the specific amino acids on M protein responsible for M-S and M-E interactions are still enigmatic. In the present study, deletion or mutation of amino acids A159 and K160, which are essential for the interaction of M protein with actin, is detrimental to the recovery of IBV from an infectious IBV clone due to a defect in late stages of the IBV replication cycle. Although, the deletion or mutation of amino acids A159 and K160 could also interact with another structural protein E, we cannot exclude the possibility that this region is essential for maintaining the integrity of the M protein and involved in the interactions with other viral components. Nevertheless, it lends support to the conclusion that interaction of the IBV M protein with actin is essential for the completion of the IBV infection cycle.",

Similar amount of viral proteins were detected in the total cell lysates but were not detected in supernatants when cytochalasin D was added early in the viral replication cycle suggests that actin filaments are essential for some early events, such as virion assembly and budding, during the assembly and maturation processes of IBV. As IBV proteins can be efficiently detected in the supernatants when cytochalasin D was added at 12 and 16 hours post-infection, respectively, it suggests that actin filaments are unlikely involved in the release of the IBV particles. Instead, our data support that actin filaments may be involved in the virion assembly and budding process of the coronavirus replication cycles. As coronavirus M protein could bind to the viral genomic RNA through packaging signal [41] and RNA replication in the cytoplasm would rely on the support of actin [42], the interaction of M protein with actin may serve as a platform to promote the binding of M protein to viral RNA as well as viral RNA replication. Alternatively, coronavirus M protein could bind to the N protein-RNA complex to stabilize the nucleocapsid [11] and extra energy would be needed in this process [21]. The interaction of M protein with actin may serve as a power station to provide energy for completion of the viral replication cycle.",
