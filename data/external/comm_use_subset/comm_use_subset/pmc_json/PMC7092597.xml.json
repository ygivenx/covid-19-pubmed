            "text": "Acute respiratory diseases comprise over 75% of overall infectious disease occurrences in developed countries, of which 80% are caused by viruses [1]. Above all, the influenza virus (IV) is recognized as a serious public health concern with 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually in the United States alone [2]. To date, conventional commercialized antiviral agents for IV have been developed to control IV pandemics by blocking two different targets: matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel and neuraminidase (NA) [3]. Transportation of H+ ions across the transmembrane is blocked by the M2 ion channel inhibitor, which results in incomplete viral uncoating and prevents viral replication. The NA inhibitor interrupts the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues on new IV, thus preventing the release of viruses from the infected host cell. Promotion of IV infection is interrupted with these inhibitors. However, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that over 99% of IV strains H3N2 and H1N1 present resistance to M2 ion channel inhibitors, including amantadine and rimantadine [4]. Furthermore, recent influenza strains, including those responsible for the pandemic outbreaks in 2009, showed enormously high resistance to the commercialized NA inhibitor, Tamiflu (oseltamivir) [5, 6]. Mutation of viral surface proteins has triggered incremental IV resistance to conventional drug treatments by transforming the drug binding site in its protein, hence increasing viral infectivity and mortality [7\u20139].",

TEM analysis was first conducted for a simple confirmation of the interaction between the virus and the nanoparticles. IAV suspension was incubated with 2 \u00d7 10\u22121 mg/mL of nanoparticles for 10 min, and then the mixtures were prepared for TEM analysis. However, interaction was difficult to observe in the TEM images with larger NPs such as PoGNP and sGNP. On the other hand, AgNP agglomerated on the viral surface as expected, since the small size of AgNP facilitated migration (Fig. 2). Another technique was considered to prove the affinity between HA and the larger sGNPs. As the isolation of IAV requires ultracentrifugation over 20,000g [31] or gradient centrifugation [32], we centrifuged the samples at 6000g for 10 min to monitor whether H3N2 precipitated with the nanoparticles. We assumed that the nanoparticle-treated H3N2 virus would precipitate with the nanoparticles in contrast to the H3N2 virus sample alone. Definitively, the real-time cycle quantification (Cq) value of PoGNP-treated H3N2 virus in redispersed precipitate solution was much lower than that in the supernatant, indicating that H3N2 virus could interact with PoGNP (Fig. 3). In addition, PoGNP attracted more H3N2 virus than sGNP at lower concentration according to the real-time Cq values of precipitated samples, which indicated that PoGNP had much higher affinity for HA compared with sGNP. The difference in attraction resulted from their surface structure; the foam-shaped porous outer surface of PoGNP created more surface area for interaction with HA than the sGNP surface.",

The antiviral effect of the nanoparticles was determined by WST-1 cytotoxicity assay by observing the optical density of treated cells at 450 nm. Compared with the other nanoparticles, PoGNP showed much higher antiviral activity on H1N1 virus, whereas AgNP showed only minor antiviral activity over 0.1 mg/mL AgNP. 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP successfully inactivated H1N1 virus after exposure for 60 min. In contrast, sGNP had no antiviral effect regardless of its concentration or exposure time (Fig. 4). Comparing PoGNP with sGNP, the difference in nanoparticle antiviral activity is the result of differences in their specific surface areas despite similar diameters; each nanoframe of PoGNP behaved as a single reactant for disulfide bonds that could interact with HA. AgNP was able to agglomerate on viral HA and had extensive specific surface area for interaction compared with sGNP due to its small size; however, PoGNP showed higher inactivation of the virus at 0.2 mg/mL. PoGNP\u2019s superior virus inactivation ability compared with AgNP and sGNP is due to both its stability under saline conditions and its high affinity for HA. The antiviral effectiveness of AgNP is restricted because AgNP aggregated in the culture media at higher concentration and it should only be treated at concentrations lower than 0.1 mg/mL due to toxicity concerns. As observed by lower attraction of sGNP to viral HA in the binding efficiency test with centrifugation, sGNP exhibited lower antiviral activity, as expected. Indeed, the inactivation of H1N1 virus by sGNP was much lower than that of PoGNP, although sGNP also exhibited affinity for HA at higher concentration. This result endorsed the fact that inactivation of H1N1 virus was caused by the cleavage of disulfide bonds ensuing from the influence of metallic nanoparticles because the relatively flat surface of sGNP made contact with the disulfide bridge difficult in contrast to PoGNP\u2019s rough surface.",

For the 10 min-treated sample, only 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP showed over 50% cell viability. Under 0.1 mg/mL PoGNP concentration, the treated virus was only slightly inactivated compared to the non-treated virus. After the 60 min treatment, the antiviral effect of treatment with 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP on H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2 increased to 74%, 76%, and 56%, respectively. 54% of MDCK cells survived H1N1 infection when treated with 0.1 mg/mL PoGNP for 60 min. H3N2 and H9N2 were minorly affected under 0.1 mg/mL PoGNP and still exhibited higher cell viability than the control group. PoGNP displayed antiviral activity on various virus strains, which is important for on-the-spot preprocessing of IAV for further analysis.

MDCK cells were infected with PoGNP-treated H3N2 virus for 24 h and the cells were lysed with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit, followed by calculation of logEID50/mL values by standard EID curve (Additional file 1: Figure S4).

Also, the amount of intracellular viral RNA was clearly influenced by the exposure time. The gene content level of viral RNA in the host cells was higher for viruses treated for 10 min compared with 60 min. Intracellular viral RNA quantification data corresponded well with the MDCK cell viability test results, revealing that the antiviral activity of PoGNP was affected by time and concentration, especially 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP was effective after exposure for 10 min. Furthermore, the result also confirmed that PoGNP blocked viral infection by inhibiting viral entry.",

As the higher sulfhydryl group concentration in the virus means the more reduction of disulfide bond has occurred, Ellman\u2019s assay was considered as a valid method for proving relationship between viral disulfide bond reduction and its attenuated infectivity. As described in Fig. 7, absorbance at 412 nm (A412) of influenza virus that was exposed to 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP showed higher A412 than sGNP and AgNP counterpart at the same concentration, indicating that PoGNP have higher affinity to the disulfide bonds in HA. Despite the size of PoGNP slightly larger than sGNP, PoGNP\u2019s higher relative surface area made a big difference in disulfide bond reduction while AgNP still displayed reductive reaction on the bonds in HA. TCEP was chosen as a positive control group of disulfide bond reducing agent since TCEP structure do not have any disulfide bond after reduced the S\u2013S bond in HA, and thus it has little effect on DTNB reduction after reacting with disulfide bonds in HA.",

On the other hand, 0.01 M TCEP-treated samples displayed lower cell viability compared to other TCEP-treated samples because of the cytotoxicity of TCEP itself [34]. The result suggested that the cleavage of disulfide bond before membrane fusion reduce viral infectivity toward MDCK cells.

Precipitation of PoGNP-treated IAVs showed lower real-time Cq values, indicating that more viruses precipitated with nanoparticles than were free in the supernatant. Furthermore, PoGNP showed more effective inhibition of viral infection compared with the non-porous sGNP and AgNP because of its extensive surface area. We suggested that the viral inhibition mechanism was due to blocking of viral attachment associated with membrane fusion, which ensued from the cleavage of disulfide bonds in HA. The results indicate that the disulfide bonds in HA could be an effective antiviral target, presenting possible development of antiviral vaccines for various IV strains. Likewise, we suggest that PoGNP could be applied to other enveloped viruses that have considerable spike proteins on the surface, such as human immunodeficiency virus or coronavirus, by cleaving disulfide bonds in their spike proteins. In addition, PoGNP has numerous electromagnetic hot spots compared to non-porous gold and silver nanoparticles, and the application of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) should be considered for future analysis.
