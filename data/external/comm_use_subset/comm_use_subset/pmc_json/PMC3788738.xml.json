            "text": "\nBurkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium found in water and wet soils of endemic areas bordering the equator, particularly Southeast Asia and Northern Australia [1-10]. The organism infects most mammals and causes the disease melioidosis in humans [1-10]. Clinical manifestations vary greatly and may present as flu-like symptoms, benign pneumonitis, acute/chronic pneumonia, or fulminating septicemia. Infection generally occurs via inhalation of aerosols or through skin abrasions, and the risk of contracting the disease is proportional to the concentration of B. pseudomallei in soil and water. In endemic areas, heavy rainfalls result in a shift from percutaneous inoculation to inhalation as the primary mode of infection, which also leads to a more severe illness. Melioidosis commonly affects the lungs and is characterized by the spread and seeding of bacteria to the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. The incubation period is not clearly defined, but may range from 2 days to many years. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, thalassemia, and chronic lung disease. Most infected patients become bacteremic and the mortality rates remain high (19-51%) despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy. Burkholderia pseudomallei is refractory to most antibiotics and resistance mechanisms include efflux pumps and \u03b2-lactamases [1-10]. The recommended treatment for melioidosis entails the use of ceftazidime and meropenem (intensive phase) and TMP-SMX and co-amoxiclav (eradication phase) for several months [11]. Response to treatment is slow and eradication of B. pseudomallei is difficult to achieve, resulting in recrudescence [1-10]. Though considered exotic to the US and most European countries, B. pseudomallei is a leading cause of sepsis and bacteremic pneumonia in endemic areas, and melioidosis is recognized as an emerging infectious disease in many tropical regions of the world [12-14].",

Burkholderia mallei causes the highly contagious zoonotic disease glanders, which primarily affects horses, mules, and donkeys. In humans, infection generally occurs by contact with infected animals via the cutaneous or respiratory route. Disease progression and pathology in humans and horses are similar, though the clinical presentation of any 2 cases in the same species, even if related by direct transmission, may vary. The clinical manifestations include febrile pneumonia with necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, or pustular skin lesions and development of multiple abscesses (AKA farcy). Most patients become bacteremic and B. mallei disseminates to the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes where it rapidly causes necrosis. The course of disease may range from acute and rapidly fatal to very slow and protracted with alternating remissions and exacerbations. Even with antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate for human glanders is 50%. Like B. pseudomallei, B. mallei is resistant to most antibiotics [8,9,15-24].",

            "text": "There is concern that B. mallei and B. pseudomallei may be used as agents of biological warfare, especially since B. mallei has already been utilized in this manner [19,25-30]. Burkholderia pseudomallei was studied by the US and Russia as a potential bioweapon, but was never used in this capacity [25,31,32]. However, the ease of acquiring B. pseudomallei from the environment coupled with its resistance to antibiotics, severity of illness upon aerosol inoculation, difficulties in diagnosis, and persistence in the host make this possibility a serious concern. If the organism was cultured, concentrated, and delivered as an aerosol, significant casualties would ensue. For these reasons, the US Federal Select Agent Program classifies B. pseudomallei and B. mallei as Tier 1 agents, and the development of countermeasures is a priority. Protection against the pulmonary form of glanders and melioidosis is of particular interest as the lung is the most likely portal of entry for the organisms during a biologic attack.",

            "text": "The most commonly used surrogate to study B. mallei and B. pseudomallei is the mouse, and intranasal inoculation has generally been utilized to model the aerosol route of infection [8,33-40]. The method is quick, cost-effective, and relies on the mouse breathing in the agent, hence mimicking the natural route of aerosol infection for human disease. The availability of transgenic strains and the wealth of murine immunological tools provide a powerful platform to study and understand pathogenesis by the organisms and develop anti-infective approaches. However, unlike humans, mice are obligate nasal breathers and possess a greater surface area in their upper respiratory tract in addition to enhanced olfactory senses [41,42]. Consequently, intranasal inoculation results in a significant proportion of the inoculum remaining in the nasal passages (and not reaching the lungs) [43,44], and leads to high rates of infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system (via olfactory tissues), which are not common in humans [37,45,46]. Moreover, intranasal inoculation entails inhalation of a liquid suspension, not small-aerosolized particles. Whole-body and nose-only aerosol exposure models have been utilized to study B. mallei and B. pseudomallei [47-52]. Though these platforms deliver small aerosol particles, they too depend on the normal the mouse breathing in the agent through the nasal passageways and favor the aforementioned alternative portals of entry into the body. Furthermore, whole-body and nose-only exposure models require specialized equipment and dedicated BSL3 laboratory space, which can be cost-prohibitive and not practical at most research facilities.",

The device generates aerosols from the tip of a bent needle attached to a high-pressure stainless steel syringe that contains the agent.

            "text": "Next, we determined the median lethal dose of B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344 according to the method of Reed and Muench [55]. Cohorts of mice were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the organisms using the MicroSprayer\u00ae and monitored for clinical signs of illness and morbidity for a period of up to 30 days. Based on the data shown in Figure 2, the calculated LD50 for the agents are 5,100 \u00b1 820 (B. pseudomallei 1026b) and 818 \u00b1 173 CFU (B. mallei ATCC23344). The value for strain ATCC23344 is consistent with published reports utilizing alternative aerosol delivery methods. Using the intranasal route of inoculation, the LD50 has been reported to be 820 CFU [39]. The use of whole body aerosol exposure chamber produced values of 1X103-1.8X103 organisms [47,50,64]. The LD50 of B. pseudomallei 1026b in our model is higher than that reported for the intranasal route of inoculation and whole body exposure chamber, which were calculated to be 1 X 103 and 10 CFU, respectively [39,50]. Factors such as the age and weight of mice, and how bacteria were cultured prior to infection (i.e. broth versus plate-grown), may account for this difference. The intranasal route of inoculation and the use of the whole body exposure chamber entail mice breathing in the agent through the nasal passages and can cause infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system (in addition to pulmonary disease), which could have contributed to the lower LD50 in these models. Intratracheal inoculation with the MicroSprayer\u00ae circumvents the mouse nasal passageways and may have reduced the potentially confounding complications due to infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system, resulting in a higher LD50 value for B. pseudomallei 1026b.",

No inflammatory infiltrates were observed in these animals. In contrast, BALF from mice infected with B. mallei ATCC23344 or B. pseudomallei 1026b were inflamed, consisting primarily of degenerate neutrophils (neutrophils that have lost ability to control water homeostasis and have swollen, eosinophilic nuclei) and activated macrophages with few, if any, respiratory epithelial cells. Degenerate neutrophils form in the presence of bacterial endotoxins like LPS, which are known to perforate their nuclear and cellular membranes. For this reason, the presence of degenerate neutrophils in cytologic preparations, even in the absence of bacteria, suggests bacterial infection [65,66]. Neutrophils ingest bacteria by receptor-mediated phagocytosis, a process which internalizes bacteria within a vacuole (e.g. phagosome) with the ultimate goal of fusing that vacuole with a lysosome, where bacteria are digested [67,68]. While the presence of extracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils suggests infection, the presence of intracellular bacteria, specifically bacteria contained within intracytoplasmic vacuoles, is indicative of bacterial infection [65,66]. Several neutrophils and macrophages were found to contain phagocytosed bacteria, confirming active infection. The BALF from infected mice also contained cellular debris and free nuclei, which along with the presence of degenerate neutrophils, indicate on-going cell necrosis, presumably due to bacterial endotoxins like LPS. Some lavage samples appeared hemorrhagic, as they possessed low to moderate numbers of erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) and/or macrophages with intracellular RBCs and hemosiderin pigment (hemoglobin breakdown product from RBCs). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mice infected with 104 organisms possessed the greatest bacterial burden and marked pyogranulomatous inflammation (Figure 6B), while animals inoculated with 102 CFU displayed moderate bacterial numbers and degree of inflammation (data not shown). The BALF from mice infected with 103 organisms demonstrated intermediate inflammation and bacterial burden (Figure 6C and 6D). Overall, no cytologic differences were observed between BALF from mice infected with B. mallei ATCC23344 and B. pseudomallei 1026b in terms of the type or magnitude of inflammation (when comparing equivalent inoculating doses). Additionally, the presence of hemorrhage and intracellular bacilli in BALF suggests that both organisms may disseminate by both lymphatic and hematogenous routes via infected macrophages or as extracellular bacilli, which is consistent with the results depicted in Figure 4 at the 72-hr time point.",

The key difference between their method and our delivery platform is the MicroSprayer\u00ae, which produces small aerosol particles. Revelli et al used 22s-gauge needles attached to gastight syringes and infused bacterial liquid suspensions into the trachea [90]. Both intratracheal inoculation approaches provide a route of aerosol infection that circumvents the mouse nasal passageways, reduces the potentially confounding complications due to infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system, and thus represent valuable surrogates to study pulmonary disease caused by B. pseudomallei and B. mallei.",

Results are expressed as the mean (\u00b1 standard error) total CFU/per tissue. Bp= B. pseudomallei 1026b, Bm=B. mallei ATCC23344. Black bars= lung homogenates, grey bars=BALF.",

Panel A shows a representative field of a sample collected from a mouse inoculated with sterile PBS (control). These control samples are low in cellularity and consist of occasional macrophages (arrow) and ciliated, columnar respiratory epithelial cells (inset). Panel B shows a representative field of a sample from a mouse infected with 104\nB. mallei bacteria. Large numbers of degenerate neutrophils (block arrows) and foamy macrophages (arrows) are seen admixed with cellular debris and occasional red blood cells. Medium-sized bacilli are seen phagocytosed by neutrophils (asterisk). Extracellular bacteria are also present (arrowheads). Panel C is a representative field of a sample from mouse infected with 103\nB. mallei cells, and Panel D is a representative field of a sample from mouse infected with 103\nB. pseudomallei CFU. In both panels, moderate numbers of degenerate neutrophils and foamy macrophages are present, along with intracellular bacilli, illustrating the similar type and magnitude of inflammation elicited by the two species at the same dose. The inset in Panel C demonstrates that neutrophils contain bacilli adhered to their surface and within the lumens of intracytoplasmic vacuoles.",
