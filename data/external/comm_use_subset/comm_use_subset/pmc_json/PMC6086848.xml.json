            "text": "Our approach also has limitations. First, the timeline was long, starting with initial conception in 2009 and culminating in clearance by the WHO's internal review process in 2013. Second, recommended approaches followed published guidelines where available (eg, Surviving Sepsis 26), but guidelines were often not available or were based on data from high\u2010income health systems. More recently, guidelines adapted for low resource settings have been published,27, 28, 29 but with few exceptions,30 the adaptation has derived from expert opinion rather than context\u2010specific randomized trials. Third, although experts represented ten countries, African and South East Asian countries were under\u2010represented, which may reflect the prominence of international academic global experts. Planned revisions will increase the representation of clinical experts in LMICs. Fourth, we did not assess the psychometric properties of the knowledge test, and short\u2010term knowledge retention may not predict longer\u2010term retention or improved patient care. Therefore, more robust evaluation is required, including with skills\u2010based assessments. Because we did not record participant names on each test, paired t tests were not possible, and the effect of the course on short\u2010term knowledge may be underestimated. Alternatively, where there was a substantial difference in number of participants between pre\u2010test and post\u2010test administrations (Vietnam, Central Asia), the improvement in scores may be an overestimate if participants with mastery were more likely to have taken the second test. Fifth, the success of this course requires acceptance by local champions and adaptation to local settings, resource constraints, and baseline knowledge and experience of participants . Finally, it is imperative to work closely with Ministries of Health to select appropriate participants.",

            "text": "This Critical Care Training Short Course faces multiple challenges to sustainability. The technical content must be kept up to date with evolving clinical research and guidelines. The course methodology and structure may need further revision in response to participant feedback, such as inclusion of hands\u2010on training with mechanical ventilators. Achieving global impact will require scaling up to reach more clinicians; recruitment, coordination and retention of expert clinician facilitators; development of a train\u2010the\u2010trainers model to sustain instruction by local clinicians; translation of materials into local languages; and development of alternate online or smartphone dissemination methods. Our experiences in Central Asia, Indonesia and Vietnam suggest that these barriers can be overcome, as these countries are planning national course implementations (Janet Diaz, Selamet Hidayat, Vu Quoc Dat; personal communications). Finally, evaluation of the course's impact on longer\u2010term knowledge retention, processes of care and patient\u2010centred outcomes is necessary. The WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness programme provides an example of both the benefits31, 32 and challenges33 of implementing teaching materials to improve clinical outcomes for seriously ill children.",

Our experience suggests that 3 days is the minimum time to deliver the content and conduct case\u2010based discussions to consolidate learning points without overwhelming participants with information. In countries where simultaneous translation is used, 3 days may not be enough.",

We have shown the feasibility of creating and delivering an evidence\u2010based and interactive Critical Care Training Short Course for non\u2010specialty and specialty clinicians in resource\u2010limited settings, using a collaborative approach between the WHO, a global network of experts in critical care and infectious disease, instructional designers, national Ministries of Health and local clinicians.
