The ARI CDA flagged an outpatient visit if the provider assigned it an ARI-related International Disease Classification, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9) diagnostic code OR issued a prescription for a cough remedy OR documented at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition in his/her clinical note, as retrieved by computerized text analysis [10].

In a preliminary effort to improve the performance of the classifier, the reference imaging reports were presented for machine-learning as four alternative training sets where: a) the text of the reports was fed either whole or scrubbed from the characters preceding the string \u201cImpression\u201d when the latter was found; b) targeted reports were either all of the non-negative reports (n = 450) or only those that described abnormalities typical for a pneumonia (n = 316). Text classification models with the highest F-measure were retained for each training set. The four retained models were then separately combined with other EMR-derived data and performance of the resulting CDAs at identifying patients that fitted our case definition compared (see next paragraph). The text classification models trained with reports that contained typical pneumonia descriptions and whose text was restricted to the \u201cImpression\u201d field led to the best performing pneumonia CDAs, and were those used for this report.",

Absent a standard, we sought clinically acceptable case definitions that could be reliably abstracted from clinical records. As is both customary and recommended by treatment guidelines [16]\u2013[19], our case definitions required supportive chest imaging. To this common imaging requirement, the Possible-Pneumonia definition added clinical symptoms whereas Pneumonia-in-Plan relied solely on the provider's final diagnostic assessment. Despite these differences, more than 95% of patients with Pneumonia-in-Plan also satisfied the more permissive Possible Pneumonia definition in both our development and validation reference populations, indicating that the two definitions addressed related clinical conditions. Given that independent EMR abstractors could identify respiratory symptoms [10], pneumonia diagnostic impressions and supportive chest imaging with a high degree of agreement, our data suggest that the Possible Pneumonia and the Pneumonia-in-Plan case definitions can serve as useful tools to reproducibly retrieve pneumonia-related information from an EMR.",

Discharge codes, however, are of limited value in epidemic surveillance because they are untimely and do not distinguish between community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia [22]. In this study, we evaluated diagnostic codes assigned by providers at the conclusion of outpatient visits, as is practiced at the Veterans Administration health system. We found these codes to represent a key component of pneumonia detection, even if they proved less accurate at finding pneumonia patients who were sent home rather than hospitalized [27]. While the utility of diagnostic codes vary when they are assigned by third parties or have reimbursement repercussions, our results nevertheless provide an impetus for diagnostic codes to be made available as soon as possible following outpatient services, so that they can be used for surveillance, decision support and quality control.",

            "text": "The chest imaging report has long been recognized as a fruitful context in which to mine for evidence of pneumonia. Over the last 20 years, various combinations of approaches, including natural language processing [28]\u2013[31], expert rules [32], [33], Bayesian [32], [34] or neural networks [35] and machine-learning [33], have held their own compared to physicians for their ability to find pneumonia-related concepts in report narratives. Imaging report analyses have been compared to discharge diagnostic codes [36], [37], but have seldom been evaluated for their added value against a broader reference standard for clinical pneumonia [38]\u2013[40]. To our knowledge, only one previous publication used imaging report analyses to detect outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia [40]. Besides bolstering the evidence for the utility of these text analyses, our data illustrate the importance of targeting them properly: in the course of this study, classifying 26,581 imaging reports did more to improve detection performance than extracting ARI symptoms from almost 14 million clinical notes. Although an assessment of the significance of the performance gained through imaging report text analysis must await purpose-specific evaluations, our data nevertheless support the notion that a generalized machine learning approach can perform well across information retrieval tasks [13], [14]. Also significant, in our view, is the ease with which we could develop the classifier. Clinical users focused on the document-level classification needed to create the reference training set. Once the latter was fed to the ARC software, model development required little further user interaction, and there was no need for custom programming. Such an efficient workflow makes it possible to quickly rebuild the classifier elsewhere, should it proves less robust than our validation exercise suggests.",

First, we did not evaluate CDA components that have been associated with pneumonia in the past such as abnormalities in vital signs [41], white blood cell count [42] or oxygenation [41], and microbiological results. While these data elements could be missing in some patients [43], they could provide an opportunity to further improve detection performance. Second, our work was performed in a health system whose population and health care practices may not be generalizable. Even if diffusion of our approaches was initially restricted to VA institutions, at least some automated pneumonia surveillance could nevertheless be deployed across all 50 states. Third, sampling was not random but instead based on a screening algorithm. While this algorithm has been validated using a random, population-based sample, our study sample remains subject to verification bias [44] such as the systematic exclusion of pneumonia patients for whom chest imaging was not obtained [45]. Fourth, the retrospective nature of the record review coupled with shortcomings of clinical acumen and chest imaging [46] imply that we may have missed pneumonia patients whose symptoms, signs or imaging abnormalities were absent [46], [47], missed, atypical, inadequately documented or miscoded [23]. Despite these potential failings, our results do reflect information committed to a real-world EMR, and thus represent a realistic environment in which to compare the relative performance of alternative detection approaches.",
