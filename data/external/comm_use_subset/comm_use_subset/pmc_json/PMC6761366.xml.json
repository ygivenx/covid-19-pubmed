To summarize, 48 observations of randomly selected HCP were performed at a university-based medical center with the hospital PPE guidelines based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations used as the expectation for proper gown use. Only 42% of HCP appropriately tied their gowns in the back, and subsequently removed the gowns by breaking the tie. Forty-eight percent potentially self-contaminated while doffing, and 42% did not follow the hospital-specified technique for gown disposal. The observations indicated that a large number of participants were at risk of contamination and suggested that there was a need to identify gown redesign opportunities. We determined that critical gaps in the standard gown included errors in closing the gown, potential for HCP exposure while providing care due to movement of the light gown material, difficulties with easily removing, and touching the external contaminated surfaces while doffing.",

A schema to code video recordings was developed with the following categories: donning gown (if and how gown was closed), PPE-related issues (exposure while squatting, tie or gown touches floor), doffing gown (pulling gown from waist, balling up gown). Coding classified behaviors as adherent or nonadherent per hospital policy. Standardized instructional materials were used to train 3 coders to identify nonadherence in the recordings. Once performance of the coders met criterion of 95% between-coder agreement in a set of training videos, they coded the study data.",

Participants were also asked to rate gowns on attributes of ease of use during donning, clinical care, doffing, convenience, design, comfort, and risk of contamination on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (standard gown best), to 4 (both gowns equal), to 7 (redesigned gown best).

A closure mechanism using an asymmetrical closure approach was favored, with the gown secured by pulling a single strap from the back to front. An adhesive strip covered by red tape was placed at the end of the strap. Pulling the tape off the adhesive strip allowed for strap securement to the front of the gown. Another design change addressed the uniform color of the gown that prevented HCP from distinguishing between the clean inner and potentially contaminated outer surfaces. Initial designs ranged from a different-colored inside gown material, to applying tape to mark the clean surface. Pilot testing revealed that a combination of these approaches was most promising. As the lightweight and static-inducing gown material had a tendency to make contact with objects as well as expose the HCP lower body during movement, we determined the bottom edge of the gown needed to be heavier. To create this additional weight, the tape marking the inner surface was also attached along the bottom of the gown. Finally, we enhanced the perforated areas of the gown material to break more easily during the doffing process. Figure 1 shows the redesigned gown.",

This work suggests that the best predictor for changes in organizational performance is actual technology use, not technology investment [15]. Thus, it is plausible to assume that increased usability will affect use, with usability becoming a predictor for behavior and ultimately adherence. This relationship has been established by work demonstrating that perceived usability predicts use and behavior [16].

Also, the comparison of the 2 gown designs favored the traditional gown design since participants have been using this gown over many years on a daily basis, while never having used the redesigned gown. Another potential limitation relates to the fact that this study limited the evaluation of the redesigned gown to nurses and nurses\u2019 aides. However, challenges and attitudes related to precaution practices and PPE use differ between different types of providers. Future work on the redesigned gown should include other healthcare workers while they perform representative tasks to assess the benefits of the gown. In addition, the utility of contact precautions my also vary upon type of provider, which requires additional, provider-specific and precaution-specific task analyses.",
