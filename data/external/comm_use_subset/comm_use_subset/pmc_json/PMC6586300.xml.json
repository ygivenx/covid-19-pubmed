A febrile child in sub-Saharan Africa may have a mild self-resolving viral infection or may be suffering from bacterial sepsis or malaria\u2014major causes of disability and death [1, 2]. Historically, febrile illness in much of Africa has been treated empirically as malaria due to the limited availability of diagnostics and the risk of untreated malaria progressing to life-threatening illness. This strategy changed in 2010 following revised guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), which recommended limiting malaria therapy to those with a confirmed diagnosis [3]. However, standard recommendations for management of febrile children who do not have malaria are lacking. Increased knowledge about the prevalence of non-malarial pathogens associated with fever is needed to inform management strategies for febrile children [2], especially in low resource settings.",

The unbiased approach to detection of sequence-based diagnostics have led to the successful detection of pathogens in some rare or complex cases where traditional methods have failed [6\u201310]. Sequence-based diagnostics are complementary to serological assays and may contribute to a better understanding of pathogen landscapes in LMIC. Towards this aim, we conducted an exploratory retrospective mNGS analysis on samples available from a cohort of children hospitalized in rural Uganda with febrile illnesses to characterize potential pathogens associated with fever. The results, which include the detection of 3 novel viral species, suggest that mNGS will likely be a valuable tool in the arsenal of assays to understand the microbial landscape in human infections.",

Chest imaging was not available to further assess these diagnoses. 72 NP samples (80%) contained at least 1 viral species (Fig 1B), with no microbes meeting our required cut-offs in 18 samples (20%). HRV-A and HRV-C were the most prevalent, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cytomegalovirus (HHV-5), influenza B, and coronavirus OC43. Other respiratory viruses identified included influenza A (H1N1), HRV-B, Human mastadenovirus B (type 7), three human parainfluenza virus types (type 1, 3 and 4), metapneumovirus, coronavirus NL63, avian coronavirus, coxsackievirus A2, coxsackievirus B2, polyomaviruses (KI), HHV-6 and HHV-7. Other viruses identified that are not typically considered respiratory pathogens included hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, parvovirus B19, mamastrovirus 1, Bwamba orthobunyavirus, betapapillomavirus 1, and rotavirus. Additionally, TTV was found in 49 (54.4%) NP swab samples, including one sample with both gemykrogvirus and TTV. For 26 (28.8%) patients, mNGS identified respiratory viral co-infections, most commonly with HRV-C (n = 11) and HRV-A (n = 5) (S1B Table). The same microbial species was identified in the NP swab and serum samples in six patients (on independent sequencing runs), one each with HRV-A, HRV-C, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, rotavirus A, and parvovirus B19.",

Some discrepancies were seen compared to blood smear readings, with false positive smears probably due to errors in slide reading, a common problem in under resourced clinics [41], and false negative smears due to the expected greater sensitivity of mNGS for identification of P. falciparum. In children with only sub-microscopic parasitemia, it is uncertain whether fevers can be ascribed to malaria, and in fact many children had both P. falciparum and additional microbes identified.

Overall, we detected at least three HRV-A and eight HRV-C types co-circulating in Tororo District. Of note, during the same collection period, a lethal HRV-C outbreak was reported in chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, in western Uganda [54]; that HRV-C was modestly related to an isolate observed in our study (74% nucleotide identity; 81% amino acid identity) (Fig 3) [54].

First, our samples were not collected randomly, but rather were a retrospective convenience sample due to logistical constraints; as such, the results are not necessarily representative of pathogens infecting Ugandan children. In particular, the lack of identification of bacteremia in study subjects may have been due to a relative paucity of severe illness, compared to that in other studies. Second, the samples were collected only over a period of three months (October\u2014December). Hence, we are unable to comment on seasonal trends in identified pathogens. Third, clinical evaluation of children followed the standards of a rural African hospital, so diagnostic evaluation was limited to physical examination and malaria blood smears. This study was not designed to compare mNGS to other clinical or laboratory assays. It is clear that more will be learned by linking rigorous clinical evaluation with mNGS results, and thereby more comprehensively assessing associations between clinical syndromes and specific pathogens. Fourth, healthy controls from the same population were not recruited in this study, hence we were unable to include them in the background model to filter out commensal microbial species specific to the Ugandan microbiome. Fifth, we were unable to use orthogonal techniques such as PCR to confirm the microbial species identified by mNGS due to lack of sample availability.",

Future metagenomic studies should include rigorous clinical and microbiological phenotyping, along with samples collected from healthy individuals. This would facilitate design of an appropriate background model to identify potential pathogens, with confirmation using orthogonal techniques. Despite these limitations, our study provides an important snapshot of causes of fever in African children that could not be identified by available diagnostics, and suggests mNGS will be an important tool for future investigations.

IDseq is a scalable and cloud based implementation of a previously published pipeline (see Fig 1 in [11]). In brief, initial host read filtering is performed using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm [17], followed by removal of duplicate/low quality and low complexity sequences [14], [16]. Next, reads are aligned once again to the host genome of interest using bowtie2 [12] to remove any remaining host reads. The non-human reads are then aligned to the NCBI nucleotide and protein database, using GSNAPL and RAPSearch, respectively [13], [15]. Additionally, reads that were identified as HHV-5 were assessed individually using BLAST, to verify specificity to this virus. All IDseq scripts and user instructions are available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag and the graphical user interface web application for sample upload is available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-web. To distinguish potential pathogens from ubiquitous environmental agents including laboratory reagent contaminants and skin commensal flora, a Z-score was calculated for both nucleic acid and protein alignments, for each genus relative to a background of non-templated (\u201cwater only\u201d) controls in addition to a previously published set of uninfected clinical mNGS samples [11]. CSF samples acquired through lumbar puncture from uninfected controls are included in this background model as there is extensive representation of the skin microbiome given the need to puncture the skin.

IDseq uses the CD-HIT-DUP tool to compress duplicate reads, hence final assignment of the rpM in a given sample represents coverage across the genome, rather than a single portion. Consistent with previous studies, low levels of \u201cindex bleed through\u201d or \u201cbarcode hopping\u201d (assignment of sequencing reads to the wrong barcode/index) was observed within the non-templated water control samples [63]. To account for barcode mis-assignment, when a microbe was found in more than one sample, it was reported only when present at levels at least four times the level of mis-assigned reads observed in the control samples. Given the extremely high levels of rotavirus found in stool samples, these samples were run in duplicate, and only microbes identified in both replicates and present at levels at least four times the number of reads mis-assigned in the control samples were reported. If the reads identified for a given microbe were not species-specific, we reported the corresponding genus. For NP and stool samples, because the nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria [45\u201348], and because of a lack of healthy Ugandan NP and stool samples to serve as controls, only non-bacterial species were reported though we did analyze NP microbiome diversity (see below).",

Assembled contigs were queried against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide (nt) database using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) to identify the closest related microbes. GenBank annotation files from genome sequence records corresponding to the highest scoring alignments were used to identify potential features within the de novo assembled genomes. Geneious v10.3.2 was used to annotate newly assembled genomes. Reference genomes for multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses were downloaded from NCBI. Multiple sequence (nucleotide) alignments were generated using the default settings in MUSCLEv3.8.1551 [65], and ModelTest-NGv0.1.5 was used to identify the best-fitting evolutionary model. Using the best-fitting model of for evolution, we reconstructed a maximum-likelihood phylogeny using RAxML-ng v0.6.0 using default settings [66]. Annotation of protein domains in the novel orthobunyavirus was performed using the InterPro webserver [67] as well as direct alignment against previously known orthobunyaviruses. The TOPCONS webserver [68] was used for the identification of transmembrane regions and signal peptides, and the NetNglyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) for the identification of glycosylation sites.",
