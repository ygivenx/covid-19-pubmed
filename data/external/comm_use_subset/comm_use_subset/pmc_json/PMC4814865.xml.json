Phylogenetic analysis based on 453 nucleotides of VP1 showed that EV\u2010D68 prevalent in Mexico during 2014 (Figure 2) formed a robust cluster with sequences of strains isolated during 2012\u20132014 in New York, California, Colorado, and Missouri, USA, and also with sequences from Italy. The EV\u2010D68 formed 3 different clades as previously reported; however, the most recently isolates including the acute\u2010flaccid\u2010myelitis\u2010associated enterovirus D68 belonged to this recent cluster (clade B1). Mexican sequences also belonged to this new clade B1 (Figure 2). Evolutionary divergence analyses showed a lowest divergence (0\u00b7005\u20130009) between 2014 Mexican isolates and California, New York, and Missouri sequences, with the exception of MEX3088/14 isolate which showed lowest divergence with Italian isolates (0\u00b7011).",

Previous results13 showed that the infection with this enterovirus serotype has remained almost undetectable at least in the last 3 years, differently from the Netherlands where EV\u2010D68 seems to circulate every year in a seasonal pattern.14 Importantly, we observed an unexpectedly high number of detections of EV/RV during the same time frame (2012\u20132013) as well as high number of EV\u2010D68\u2010positive cases. These data are lower, compared with 36% of EV\u2010D68 cases tested by CDC in 49 states from August 2014 to January 2015.15 This is the first time that we detect an increase in respiratory diseases related to EV\u2010D68, somewhat expected due to the closeness to the United States and the continuous flow of individuals between the two countries. Molecular analysis of EV\u2010D68 from Mexico City tended to group with US sequences, supporting this hypothesis.",
