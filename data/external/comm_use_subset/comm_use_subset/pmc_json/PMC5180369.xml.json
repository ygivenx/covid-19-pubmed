In particular, retrospective serological studies have shown that camels have been infected by MERS-CoV or MERS-CoV-like viruses well before 2012.2 Camel MERS-CoV infections are not associated with overt disease signs in animals, but are believed to be a source for human cases.",

Intriguingly, while its S1/S2 site is identical to the one found in EMC/2012 spike, the S2\u2032 cleavage site was found to contain two substitutions: S886A and S888I. To contextualize this finding with more recent sequencing data and to identify other possible variants, we performed comprehensive sequence alignments of MERS-CoV spike S2\u2032 sequences available on GenBank (Supplementary Figure S1). We identify HKU205 S2\u2032 as the only reported variant sequence in an otherwise invariant site for the 386 sequences analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein sequence reveals that HKU205 is divergent and forms a basal sister relationship with clade A and B MERS-CoV sequences (Figure 1A). The sequence for HKU205 S2\u2032 was analyzed and compared with those of representative coronaviruses from all four genera (Figure 1B). While S2\u2032 cleavage motifs show a high degree of variability amongst coronaviruses, the sequence immediately downstream of it, recognized as being the coronavirus fusion peptide,9, 17, 18, 19 is extremely well conserved. However, HKU205 is the only known coronavirus that contains an isoleucine instead of a serine at the residue position immediately following the cleavage site, corresponding to the P1\u2032 position of the furin cleavage motif.",

Despite still containing two paired basic arginine residues, which are typically found in furin cleavage sites, the HKU205 S2\u2032 sequence is not predicted to be cleaved by furin according to PiTou 2.0 cleavability scoring algorithm (Table 1).15, 20 Furthermore, the MEROPS protease database indicates that of the 208 known furin-cleaved substrates, none contain an isoleucine at the position immediately after the scissile bond (P1\u2032).16 To validate these predictions, we performed fluorogenic peptide cleavage assays and demonstrate that while furin was able to proteolytically process EMC/2012 S2\u2032-derived peptide (Vmax=7.3\u00b10.2 relative fluorescence units (RFU)/min), the HKU205 S2\u2032 peptide could not be cleaved by the protease (Vmax=0.6\u00b10.3 RFU/min) (Figure 2A and Table 1). To specifically assess the effect of introducing the S2\u2032 mutations, we generated by site-directed mutagenesis a full-length EMC/2012 spike protein harboring the S886A and S888I substitutions (EMC205-S2\u2032 S) and performed a western blot analysis on MLV-based pseudovirions harboring either wild-type (EMCwt) or mutated (EMC205-S2\u2032) S proteins (Figure 2B). In the non-treated condition (lane 1) EMCwt S migrated with the same band pattern as shown previously,8 with full-length (uncleaved) protein and S1/S2 cleavage product due to furin processing during S protein maturation in producer cells. Treatment of EMCwt S with recombinant furin (lane 2) generates a new band (above 65 kDa marker) corresponding to proteolytic processing at the S2\u2032 site. Although the EMC205-S2\u2032 S band pattern is identical to the one observed for EMCwt in the non-treated condition (lane 1), mutating the S2\u2032 site abrogates furin cleavage, as no S2\u2032 band was observed for EMC205-S2\u2032 S (lane 2). These results confirm that the HKU205 substitutions within the S2\u2032 cleavage site block furin cleavability.",

Expression of EMCwt S is accompanied by the formation of spontaneous large syncytia (non-treated condition). Furin overexpression or treatment with exogenous recombinant furin increase the average size of syncytia (from an average of ~114 nuclei to ~140\u2013150 nuclei). Furthermore, inhibition of furin activity by treatment with 75 \u03bcM of the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK abrogated syncytia formation. In contrast, expression of EMC205-S2\u2032 S was not accompanied by syncytia formation in all conditions tested, including when furin is overexpressed or present exogenously. These data confirm that the HKU205 S2\u2032 mutations abrogate furin-mediated fusion activation. Next, the luciferase gene reporter-containing MLV pseudovirions harboring either EMCwt or EMC205-S2\u2032 S were further analyzed. Quantification by nanoparticle tracking analysis of the concentration of both types of pseudovirions shows that the introduction of the 205-S2\u2032 mutation did not significantly alter particle concentration produced compared with EMCwt S-pseudotyped particles (Supplementary Figure 2A). EMCwt or EMC205-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles were used to infect Huh-7, Vero-E6 and MRC-5 cells (Figure 3B), along with control-pseudotyped particles: \u2018bald' or no envelope particles (\u0394env), and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped particles or VSV-G (Supplementary Figure 2B). For the three cell lines, \u0394env particle infectivity was close to background levels observed in the non-infected (NI) control conditions (~102 range of relative luciferase units or RLU). When positive control VSV-G particles were assayed, infectivity measurements rose to ~106 (Vero-E6) and ~107 (Huh-7 and MRC-5) RLU levels, confirming that this system allows measurement of heterologous viral envelope protein-mediated entry and infectivity. For the MERS S-pseudotyped particles, in all cell lines tested, a significant drop in infectivity was observed for EMC205-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles compared with EMCwt S-pseudotyped particles, but the most pronounced effect was in Huh-7 cells (4.4-fold decrease) that naturally express high levels of furin.8 Since there were no significant differences in viral concentrations between EMCwt and EMC205-S2\u2032 S-pseudovirions (Supplementary Figure 2A), we attribute the drop in infectivity to the mutation of the S2\u2032 site in the EMC205-S2\u2032 S protein. These results suggest that while HKU205 S2\u2032 can still be activated by other host cell proteases, the loss of furin cleavability decreases its fusogenic activity.",

Trypsin cleaved both EMC/2012 and HKU205 S2\u2032 peptides, with the EMC/2012 peptide still retaining a higher cleavage rate (EMC/2012 Vmax=220.5\u00b13.4 RFU/min, HKU205 Vmax=67.6\u00b11.3 RFU/min). Cathepsin L cleavage was detected for the EMC/2012 peptide (Vmax=5.8\u00b10.2 RFU/min), and to a much lesser extent for HKU205 S2\u2032 (Vmax=2.2\u00b10.1 RFU/min). Vmax data for the proteases tested in this study are summarized in Table 2, and along with western blot data, suggest that HKU205 S has a more restricted range of activating proteases than EMC/2012, being unable to utilize furin and likely more dependent on trypsin-like proteases.",

            "text": "As furin proteolytic processing of MERS-CoV S S2\u2032 was suggested to add an extra layer of proteolytic activation, we analyzed the effect of introducing the EMC/2012 S2\u2032 furin site within full-length HKU205 S (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 2). Wild-type HKU205 S (205wt) protein, and a HKU205 S variant containing the EMC/2012 S2\u2032 cleavage site (205EMC-S2\u2032) were synthesized, incorporated into MLV pseudovirion and analyzed by western blot (Figure 5A). Although 205wt S is not cleaved at S2\u2032 upon furin treatment (205wt lane 2), the introduction of EMC/2012 S2\u2032 in the HKU205 S background allows for detection of the S2\u2032 cleaved product. We next performed a cell\u2013cell fusion assay on Huh-7 cells expressing either 205wt and 205EMC-S2\u2032 S (Figure 5B). 205wt S displayed low fusogenicity in all conditions tested, a situation reminiscent of the EMC205-S2\u2032 S condition in Figure 3A. The introduction of the EMC/2012 S2\u2032 site in the HKU205 S background allowed for the formation of spontaneous syncytia upon expression (average of ~60 nuclei/syncytium), which increased in average size when furin was overexpressed or when exogenous furin was present (~70 and ~77 nuclei/syncytium, respectively). Furin inhibitor treatment abrogated the formation of 205EMC-S2\u2032 S-induced syncytia. These results confirm that switching the HKU205 S2\u2032 site to the EMC/2012 S2\u2032 site in the HKU205 S background allows for enhanced furin-mediated fusogenicity of the fusion protein. The 205wt and 205EMC-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles were subsequently assayed for particle concentration by nanoparticle tracking analysis (Supplementary Figure 2A). These measurements showed that there were no statistically significant differences in concentration of particles produced between 205wt and 205EMC-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles and between these particles and the EMCwt and EMC205-S2\u2032 S-pseudotyped particles. The pseudovirions were then assayed for infection in Huh-7 cells (Figure 5C). 205wt S-pseudotyped particles displayed low infectivity (2.65 \u00d7 102 RLU) close to NI and \u0394env conditions (Supplementary Figure 2B). However, a significant ~2 log10 increase of infectivity is observed when EMC/2012 S2\u2032 furin cleavage site is present (2.21 \u00d7 104 RLU), confirming that the furin-cleaved S2\u2032 site enhances fusion activation and infectivity. These analyses confirm that the narrow spectrum of activating proteases capable of processing HKU205 S2\u2032 decreases viral infectivity and suggest that this strain may have a reduced cell and host tropism range.",

Likewise, the pseudotyped particle infectivity assays have shown that wild-type HKU205 S-pseudovirions have very little infectivity, while substituting its S2\u2032 site with the furin site found in EMC/2012 significantly increased infectivity in Huh-7 cells, but did not restore it to the levels observed for wild-type EMC/2012 S-pseudovirions. Further investigation is required to understand the biological consequence of the other reported variations found in HKU205 S, particularly the substitutions in the S1 receptor-binding domain. In addition, because attempts to culture HKU205 virus have so far been unsuccessful,12 we used a mammalian codon-optimized gene expression strategy, which allowed us to robustly express and analyze all MERS-CoV S variant proteins.

Huh-7 cells were transfected to express MERS-CoV EMC/2012 S with either wild-type (EMCwt) or HKU205 substituted S2\u2032 site (EMC205-S2\u2032).
