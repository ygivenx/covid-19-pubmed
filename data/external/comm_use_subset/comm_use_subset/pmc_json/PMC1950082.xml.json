In addition, the household provides a \u201claboratory\u201d within which key measures of transmission such as infectiousness, generation time and the effect of immunity or vaccination can be studied [1]. In recent years considerable effort has gone into understanding the dynamics of transmission within populations organised into households using mathematical models [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Most effort has gone into analysing the asymptotic behaviour of these models, elucidating the threshold levels of transmission required for infection to be self-sustaining, calculating final epidemic sizes, or predicting the impact of generalised or targeted interventions designed to reduce or eliminate transmission. In parallel, methods have been derived to estimate the parameters which govern transmission within the household from detailed case reports [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, scant effort appears to have been paid to how to apply household structured models to the analysis of epidemics, either retrospectively or in real time.",

Extensive effort is, and should continue to be, spent on identifying the conditions where different types of simplification (household models, static network models, spatial metapopulation models\u2026) can and can't be justified, and in developing analytical approximations to describe disease transmission within such simplified structures.",

Pure household models have been used fruitfully to explore detailed policy options in a city-wide response to an influenza pandemic [20].

The individual reproduction number R (t ) is defined roughly as the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan; as I will show below, there are several ways of defining this more precisely. The household reproduction number R* (t ) is defined here as the average number of households a household infected at time t can infect [3], [6]. The individual reproduction number R (t ) rightly plays a privileged role in epidemiology, as it is a meaningful measure within any contact network. However, of the possible summary measures of epidemic progress, it is not necessarily the most useful. For example, for an emerging directly transmitted pathogen, such as pandemic influenza virus, public health interventions may target the household rather than the individual, enforcing household quarantine as well as offering antivirals to the household to limit transmission within the household. In such a situation, the household reproduction number R * (t ) is more directly related to the parameters which characterize the intervention, and is thus a better measure of the effect of these interventions. These quantities (R (t ) and R * (t )) share the two essential properties of reproduction numbers, namely that they increase when infectiousness increases and decrease when infectiousness decreases (monotonicity), and that they mark a threshold that separates exponentially growing epidemics (when R (t )>1 or equivalently R * (t )>1) from exponentially declining epidemics (when R (t )<1 or equivalently R * (t )<1) [3], [6].",

First, it is typically easier to identify their key parameters, and second they more readily adapt to describe multi-level transmission (by multi-level, I mean here within-household and between household). A disadvantage is that it can be harder to include heterogeneities. Nomenclature is confusing, since both types of model have their origin in the same classic paper of Kermack and McKendrick [21], and both the SIR model and the simplest time-since-infection model are known as \u201cthe Kermack-McKendrick model\u201d.",

It is commonly a single peaked function reflecting pathogen growth followed by immune suppression, or host death, but can be more exotic such as the double peaked profile associated with early and late transmission of HIV [22], or the repeated peaks of malaria [23]. \u03b2 (t, \u03c4) also reflects the effective contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals, which can change during the course of a single infection, increasing for example if a person coughs or sneezes due to respiratory disease, or decreasing if a person takes to bed with illness, and during the course of the epidemic as public health measures are implemented. More discussions of the components (infectiousness and contact) of \u03b2 (t, \u03c4) can be found in [24]. Because I am interested in outbreaks of emerging infections, I will not describe explicitly reductions in the susceptible population caused by the epidemic. Formally this corresponds to working in the infinite population limit. This assumption is not essential for this section however, since \u03b2 (t, \u03c4) could also be thought of as incorporating the proportion of cases that are susceptible; the assumption becomes more important in the later sections on household models.",

Second, right censoring can cause the observed generation times to be shorter or longer than expected for a growing or declining epidemic, respectively [26]. Third, as apparent here, if the reproduction number R (t) changes due to depletion of susceptibles, changes in contact rates or public health measures, then this will also change the observed generation times for infectious individuals during that period of change. Thus the distribution w (\u03c4) is really intended as a measure of infectiousness which will correspond to generation times for an index case in an ideal large closed setting where contact rates are constant. It can be inferred from data on the timing of cases, as in [10], [13].",

An algorithm to deal with this issue was proposed by [29], but switching instead to the instantaneous reproduction number estimated by equation (9) may be a simpler solution. Right censoring is not however the only complication associated with estimating reproduction numbers in practice, and is not completely absent from (7) due to the delay in detecting infections.

Because, as I have shown, the linearised Kermack-McKendrick model is applicable even when susceptibility and infectiousness are heterogeneous, this method is acceptable despite the fact that households may be quite heterogeneous in size and in the number of people infected. One analogous situation where this approach has been used is in estimating farm-to-farm reproduction numbers in the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth virus epidemic [27]. However, unless specifically tailored to this task, it is unlikely the data will be collected in the requisite form for this approach to be used in the human household situation.

The link between the two can be thought of as the function \u03b2 (t, \u03c4) which translates the impact of changing processes within the host into changing infectiousness as a function of time since infection. The approach taken here to modelling household transmission is to study a three-level hierarchical model of transmission. The three levels are within-host, within-household, and between households. The natural history of infection is described by the individual infectiousness function \u03b2 (t, \u03c4). I assume in this section that individuals are homogenous in infectiousness and susceptibility. I then use this to predict the course of epidemics within households, and derive a function \u03b2 * (t, \u03c4 *) which describes the average infectiousness of a household towards other households as a function of the time since the household was infected, \u03c4 * (from here-on, I use the starred symbols to denote properties of households, and un-starred symbols to denote properties of individuals).

Because of the general form of the relation between generation time and reproduction number seen in equation (12), this will result in over-estimates of the household reproduction number R* (r). To provide a counter-balancing under-estimate of R* (r), I also consider an alternative approximation obtained by assuming the same total number of cases as predicted by this Reed-Frost model, but where all cases are assumed to be infected by the first index case. This is not a formal lower bound, since in the limit of infinite infectiousness within the household, all members of the household will be infected simultaneously upon introduction of the infection into the household.

While it would be straightforward to use demographic data and exponential growth rates from earlier pandemics combined with inter-pandemic data on the transmissibility of influenza within households to obtain estimates of R * for historical pandemics, it has not been shown that the within household transmission parameters for inter-pandemic influenza adequately describe the pandemic situation, so I focus instead on providing illustrative examples using current demographic data (on the household size distribution from the UK) [34], and recent data on the transmissibility of influenza in modern households [10].",

The former study followed seronegative households for a two week winter outbreak of seasonal influenza. The corresponding escape probabilities are Q2 = 50.9% (i.e. the probability of not being infected by the other household member in a household of size two is 50.9%), Q3 = 63.8%, Q4 = 71.4%, Q5 = 76.4% and Q6 = 79.9%. On the scale of other infections, this places influenza as being approximately as infectious as mumps, but a lot less infectious than either varicella-zoster or measles [1]. By applying the Reed-Frost model to these data with this distribution of households, I obtain estimates of the average number of infections in each generation of infection of \u03bc1 \u00b0 1, \u03bc2 = 0.64 (i.e. the first index case directly infects an average of 0.64 people in his or her household), \u03bc3 = 0.19, \u03bc4 = 0.036, \u03bc5 = 0.0037 and \u03bc6 = 0.00021, and thus the estimate for the total expected number of cases in an infected household is \u03bc = \u03a36\ni\n = 1\n\u03bci = 1.87, to be compared to the mean size of 3.06.

This analysis is perhaps a little artificial when applied to measles, since a large proportion of the population will have immunity either due to past infection or vaccination with the live MMR vaccine. The principal motivation is to further test and illustrate the methods in a case where good data on the transmission dynamics within households are available. Stratification by household of the recent outbreaks of measles caused by decreasing uptake of the MMR vaccine could reveal whether household heterogeneities should have be accounted for in estimating the changing reproduction number of measles [36].",

Similarly school and workplace closures as well as restrictions on leisure activity can be thought of as trying to reduce between household transmission. Analytical approaches are also invaluable in calibrating and providing independent checks on more detailed individual based micro-simulations, such as [13], [17], [20]. Some control interventions require more subtle analyses; for example it has been shown that vaccinating whole households is not the most effective strategy for a given vaccine coverage rate, and that alternative strategies such as preferentially vaccinating larger households could be considered [39].",
