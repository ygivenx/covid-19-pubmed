It is the most important cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries [1]. Concomitant respiratory viral infections have been described in 8\u201342% of patients, and bacterial infections were found in 33% of patients [2\u20138]. The clinical presentation of patients with and without concomitant infection is similar [2,8]. In one study, bacterial co-infection alluded to a trend towards a higher rate of resistance to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), without reaching statistical significance (26% vs 15%, odds ratio 1.77 (95% confidence interval 0.71\u20134.41)) [8]. The accepted definition of IVIG resistance is based on the persistence or recrudescence of fever 36 hours after the end of IVIG infusion [1]. However, it is unclear how concomitant infection influences the resolution of fever and response to IVIG treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of concurrent infection on the prevalence of IVIG resistance and coronary outcome.",

The main outcome was resistance to IVIG treatment in children with, versus those without concurrent infection. Secondary outcomes included duration of fever, progress of inflammatory markers and coronary artery complications.

Clinical KD criteria were reviewed and children classified as complete or incomplete KD, in the presence of fever and \u22643 clinical criteria for the latter. Delay in IVIG administration was defined as > 10 days between onset of fever and IVIG administration; and IVIG resistance as persistent or recrudescent fever (> 38.5\u00b0C) 36 hours after the end of IVIG infusion. Concurrent infection was defined as a clinical diagnosis and proven concurrent infection as patients with a positive microbiologic testing or imaging study in the presence of clinical symptoms. Testing for concomitant infection was based on clinical symptoms. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed according to current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines [9]. Gastroenteritis was defined as gastrointestinal symptoms with positive stool cultures for virus or pathogenic bacteria. Children with respiratory symptoms and a positive respiratory virus multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus) were diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Otitis media was diagnosed according to current American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines [10]. Children with clinical signs of exudative pharyngitis in the presence of a positive group A streptococcus culture were diagnosed with concurrent infection. Bacterial adenitis was diagnosed in the presence of clinical symptoms with signs of abscess formation and/or necrosis on ultrasound. Children with positive serology for acute infection (IgM) with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), measles, parvovirus and mycoplasma before IVIG administration were considered to have concurrent infection. Pneumonia was diagnosed when chest X-ray, interpreted by a pediatric radiologist, confirmed the presence of a consolidation, in the presence of respiratory symptoms.",

CA aneurysm was defined as a localized dilatation of a portion with adjacent normal measurements, or an obvious saccular deformation of the CA.

Coronary artery dilation at time of diagnosis was found in 58 (38%) patients, similarly distributed according to the presence or absence of concurrent infection (20 (34%) versus 38 (40%) patients, respectively; p = 0.45), and persisted in 17 (11%) patients (in 5 (9%) versus 12 (13%) patients, respectively; p = 0.42). Coronary aneurysms were diagnosed in 17 (11%) patients, without significant difference between patients with and without infection neither (7 (12%) versus 10 (11%) patients, p = 0.80). While the risk of coronary aneurysm was similar between patients with viral versus bacterial infection (5 (19%) versus 2 (12%) patients, p = 0.69), patients with bacterial infection were more likely to have coronary artery dilation (13 (48%) versus 3 (18%) patients, p = 0.04).",

Our results challenge this definition since fever may be maintained by an infection, either viral or bacterial, that is not likely to respond to IVIG. Inflammatory markers are often used to help guide the decision about the need for additional treatment in KD. In our series, patients with concurrent infection presented higher CRP levels at baseline, as well as 48 hours after initial treatment. This is consistent with a retrospective study on the variability in response to IVIG, which showed a higher rate of concomitant infection and higher CRP levels in complete non-responders to IVIG treatment compared to partial non-responders and responders [12]. Thus, both the persistence of fever after IVIG treatment and elevated inflammatory markers contribute to the increased likelihood of \u201cIVIG resistance\u201d in patients with concomitant infections. Interestingly, non-response to IVIG therapy was associated with the use of antibiotics in a prior single-center retrospective study [12]. One would have expected patients with concomitant infection, at least bacterial, to have lower rate of IVIG resistance if the infection was controlled by antibiotics. Both in prior reports and this series [12], the use of antibiotic was found to be associated with non-response to IVIG treatment, independent of whether or not an infection was confirmed. However, it is not clear if it is just reflecting the underlying infection, or KD that is resistant to initial treatment.",

IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 have been shown to be essential in the development of KD [13]. The IL-1 pathways play a critical part of the host defense against microbial pathogens through activation of toll like receptors [14,15]. Moreover, inositol-triphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) has a critical role in mediating NLRP3 expression and intracellular calcium, which is then responsible for IL-1\u03b2 production [16]. Genetic polymorphism in ITPKC is associated with higher IL-1\u03b2 cytokines and treatment failure [16]. This raises the question if concomitant infection increases resistance to IVIG treatment by increasing levels of IL-1\u03b2 cytokines. This could be very important as new treatment strategies are targeting IL-1 blockade in recalcitrant KD.",

In this series, patients with resistance to IVIG treatment had a higher risk of developing CA complication. Notwithstanding, the rate of CA complication was statistically independent of the presence of infection in our series and in previous series [8]. Thus, the lack of increased risk of CA complication in the setting of persistent fever in patients with KD and concomitant infection argues for infection as the cause of fever as opposed to IVIG resistance. It questions whether this \u201cexcessive\u201d diagnosis of IVIG resistance is well justified when there is a concomitant infection, and if the current definition of treatment resistance should be modified. Retreatment with IVIG or other immunosuppressive therapies may also have had a protective effect on the development of CA complication. However, the rate of CA complication was similar between patients with and without infection, even after accounting for the number of IVIG treatment received. Thus, other criteria need to be used to help with decision for retreatment of patients with persistent fever and concomitant infection. Coronary artery dimensions may be a more useful marker for the need for additional treatment in this at risk population.",

Notwithstanding, at least 5% of children remain febrile despite multiple dose of IVIG [18]. These particular patients are at even greater risk of CA complications, and additional therapies are usually administered [19], including corticosteroids [20\u201322], anti-TNF alpha agents [23,24], cyclosporine [25], cyclophosphamide [26] and more recently anakinra (anti-interleukine1) [27,28]. The use of these additional therapies is based on effectiveness in other vasculitis, with no prospective clinical trials to show effectiveness on coronary artery outcome. In patients with concerns for concurrent infection, the benefit of those additional therapies should be carefully balanced against the increased risk of infection. It is important to make this distinction, in order to 1) avoid using aggressive immunosuppressive therapies in patients with persistent fever due to uncontrolled infection and 2) avoid not treating aggressively a patient with KD that is resistant to initial treatment and at increased risk of serious coronary artery complications. However, this distinction can be clinically very difficult to answer, and caution should be exercise to prevent both cardiac complications and adverse side effects of therapies.",

On one hand, in the absence of systematic testing for infections there is a potential underestimation of the actual concurrent infection rate, as some infections could not be identified. On the other hand, inclusion of only children with infectious workup at time of initial KD diagnosis could have falsely increased the rate of concurrent infection. However, the rate of concomitant infection in this series was similar to those previously published [8]. Moreover, positive testing for virus and/or throat culture in children could reflect a carrier status rather than actual concurrent infection. However, because infectious workup was performed based on children\u2019s symptoms, the positive results most likely represent an actual infection. Serologies for different viral infections (CMV, EBV, mycoplasma) can be difficult to interpret in an acute inflammatory setting, with IgM cross-reactivity. These infections could not be confirmed by PCR due to the retrospective nature. However, this could only have affected 3 children, and statistical analysis excluding these children did not affect the results. Moreover, whereas the AHA definition of resistance to IVIG treatment is based on persistent fever 36 hours after the end of IVIG infusion [1], other factors are considered in the decision whether or not to retreat patients, including inflammatory markers and CA dimensions. Thus, some patients were classified as resistant to treatment based on the definition, but were not retreated and had favorable evolution. Small sample size of sub-groups analysis and secondary aims limit the statistical power, and results should be interpreted in light of these limitations.",
