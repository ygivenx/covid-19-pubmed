The subsequent re-emergence of human H5N1 disease in southern China [4], Vietnam [5], Thailand and Cambodia [6] has raised the specter of a new influenza pandemic. While human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 subtype influenza virus appears to be inefficient so far, the disease has exceptional severity in those affected with reported mortality rates ranging from 33% in Hong Kong in 1997 to 55% in Thailand and Vietnam in 2004. The reasons for this unusual severity of human disease have remained unclear.",

We also reported that patients with H5N1 disease have unusually high serum concentrations of chemokines IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10) and MIG (monokine induced by interferon \u03b3) [4].

In primates experimentally infected with H5N1/97 virus, the type I and II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages were found to contain viral antigen [16]. Virus infection of alveolar pneumocytes was also demonstrated in the lung of a patient with fatal H5N1 disease [17]. Human alveolar epithelial cells are vital for the maintenance of lung function and the pulmonary air-blood barrier. In addition, human respiratory epithelial cells respond to viral infections by mounting a cytokine response that contributes both to the innate and adaptive host defenses [18]. Furthermore, type II pneumocytes express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in vivo [19]. Expression of class II MHC is usually limited to specialized cells of the immune system whose role is to present foreign antigen to helper T cells [20,21]. The expression of these molecules on alveolar epithelial cells is likely to be of relevance to the adaptive immune response. Therefore it is important to study cytokine responses induced by infection of epithelial cells with influenza viruses including H5N1 viruses.",

The research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. Human type II pneumocytes were isolated using a modification of the methods previously described [19,23]. Briefly, after removing visible bronchi, the lung tissue was chopped into pieces of >0.5 mm thickness using a tissue chopper, washed with balanced salt solution (BSS, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C three times to partially remove macrophages and blood cells. The tissue was digested using a combination of trypsin (0.5%, GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and elastase (2 units/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) twice for 15 min at 37\u00b0C in a shaking water-bath. The partially digested tissue was minced in the presence of 40% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in DMEM/F12 medium and DNase I (350 units/ml) (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and cell clumps dispersed by repeatedly pipetting the cell suspension for 10 minutes. After filtration through gauze and a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer to ensure a single cell suspension, the cells were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 medium and small airway growth medium (SAGM, Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Maryland, USA) containing 5% FBS and 350 units/ml DNase I, on tissue-culture treated plastic Petri dishes in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) for 2 hours in order to let macrophage attach on the plastic surface. The non-adherent cells were layered on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (densities 1.089 and 1.040 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The cell layer at the interface of the two gradients was collected and washed four times with BSS to remove the Percoll. To remove remaining alveolar macrophages, the cell suspension was incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD-14 antibodies at room temperature for 20 min under constant mixing. After the removal of the beads using a magnet and assessment of cell viability by trypan-blue exclusion, the purified type II pneumocyte suspension was suspended in SAGM supplemented with 1% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and plated at a cell density of 300,000 cells/cm2. The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) under liquid-covered conditions, and growth medium was changed daily starting from 60 hours after plating the cells.",

The amount of IP-10 and IL-6 secreted by bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells infected with all three H5N1 viruses at 24 hours post infection were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than that secreted by cells infected with H1N1 virus (Figure 8 and 9). At 24 hours post infection, levels of IP-10 induced by H5N1/97 and both H5N1/04 viruses were comparable. However, at 6 hours post-infection, the recent H5N1/04 viruses 1194/04 and 3046/04 appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus (p < 0.05) (Figure 8). RANTES protein secreted from bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in response to H5N1/97 and 1194/04 (H5N1/04) were significantly higher than that induced by H1N1 virus. Although the level RANTES mRNA in 3046/04 (H5N1/04) infected cells at 6 hours post infection was significantly higher than those H1N1 infected cells, the RANTES protein secreted by these cells at 24 hours post infection was only increased 4 fold (p = 0.062; not significant) (Figure 5 and 10). We failed to detect any interferon-beta proteins secreted from the supernatants of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells after influenza viruses infection (data not shown) but it should be noted that the limit of detection of the interferon-beta ELISA was high (250 pg/ml).",

            "text": "We found that the replication efficiency of the H5N1 and H1N1 viruses was similar in both primary human alveolar (Figure 4) and bronchial epithelial cells (Figure 6). Both influenza virus subtypes induced an IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES, and IL-6 responses. The cytokine induction was dependent on viral replication since UV-inactivated virus did not induce any effect. Interestingly, we found that H5N1/97 and 1194/04 (H5N1/04) viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon-beta, RANTES and IL-6 mRNA and protein than the human H1N1 virus (Figure 5, 7, 8 to 10). Thus, the observed differences of mRNA are reflected in levels of cytokine and chemokine proteins secreted (Figure 8 to 10). The results with 3046/04 (H5N1/04) were generally similar to 1194/04 (H5N1/04) with the exception that the levels of RANTES protein in type II pneumocytes was not significantly elevated when compared with H1N1 virus infected cells (Figure 10) although the mRNA levels were (Figure 5). Our inability to detect any interferon-beta proteins in our experiments in spite of marked induction of mRNA is probably related to the limited sensitivity of the interferon beta ELISA. A more sensitive bioassay for interferon-beta may be required for this purpose. The type II pneumocytes used in these experiments were derived from a total of 13 donors and each set of experimental data is based on the results of at least three separate experiments from three donors therefore excluding a donor specific artifact. The bronchial epithelial cells were purchased from a commercial source and comes from one donor. However, since the results from these cells are broadly in line with those from the type II pneumocytes, again, we think that donor specific artifacts are unlikely to explain the results we have obtained. Finally, these results are also comparable to our previous observations from primary human monocyte derived macrophages [12] with the exception that in contrast to macrophages, no TNF alpha and IL-1 beta was induced in respiratory epithelial cells by any of the viruses tested.",

H5N1 viruses isolated from patients with H5N1 disease in Hong Kong in 1997, Vietnam in 2004 and human influenza viruses of the H1N1 subtype all replicate with similar efficiency. Increase in the MOI of the H1N1 virus did not result in an increase of cytokine responses to levels comparable to that of the H5N1 viruses. The cellular mechanisms underlying this differential cytokine hyper-induction by H5N1 viruses are presently poorly understood. Studies on the transformed bronchial epithelial cell line A549 previously demonstrated that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) is involved in the influenza virus A initiated cytokine responses [27]. It remains to be determined whether H5N1 viruses also act via TLR-3 signaling in primary human epithelial cells.",

In fact, autopsy examination showed an increased CD3+ T cells in the interstitium of the lung from patients with H5N1 diseases [4]. In addition, IL-6 has been shown to be released by macrophages and epithelial cells during lung injury [31] and the effects of IL-6 are synergistic with those of IL-1 and TNF-alpha [32].

Thus there appears to be an association between the property of hyper-inducing cytokines and high virulence. Additionally, in pig epithelial cells, H5N1/97 viruses were found to resist the antiviral effects of interferon [36] and this may also be relevant in pathogenesis. It is notable that patients with avian influenza (H5N1) disease appeared to have higher levels of IP-10 in their sera than those with infections with the human influenza viruses [4] providing in vivo data that parallels our present findings in vitro. Studies on recombinant viruses bearing the HA and NA of the 1918 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic virus showed that these viruses have enhanced virulence for mice and induce higher levels of macrophage-derived chemokines in vivo in mice [37]. However, such observations of hyper-induction of cytokines in vivo may simply reflect more extensive replication of the respective virus. The studies in vitro with H5N1 viruses exclude such potential confounding factors and it would be relevant to study the cytokine profiles of the 1918 recombinant viruses in in vitro models similar to those described here.",

Previous findings showed that H5N1/97 viruses also hyper-induce cytokines from macrophages and that patients with H5N1 disease have high levels of IP-10 and other chemokines in the serum. These findings may be relevant to the pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. The recent re-emergence of H5N1 disease in humans is a cause for renewed pandemic concern and highlights the need for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease. Such understanding will lead to new strategies for managing human H5N1 disease and enhance our preparedness to confront pandemic influenza, whether from H5N1 or other influenza A subtypes.",
