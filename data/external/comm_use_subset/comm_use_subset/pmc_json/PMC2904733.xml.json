More than 350 million individuals are HBV carriers worldwide and over one-third of them develop serious liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma [2]. Major obstacles in HBV research have been the inability of the virus to infect cells in vitro and lack of adequate animal models for HBV infection, though primary human hepatocytes and HepaRG cell line have been used to study HBV infection [3]. Human primary hepatocytes and HepaRG cells can support HBV life cycle, but have limitations in accessibility, reproducibility and low level of HBV replication, and a large amount of input virus was needed to infect low proportion of cells [4-6]. DHBV and woodchuck hepatitis B virus (WHBV) are classified into the family of hepadnaviridae. Thus for hepadnavirus infection primary hepatocytes of ducks (DHBV) and woodchucks (WHBV) are still considered as suitable models for investigating the viral replication and pathogenesis [7,8].",

In the present study, we intend to utilize the DHBV-PDHs system to explore global protein expression changes during hepadnavirus infection by 2-DE. A total of 75 differentially expressed protein spots were revealed by 2-DE between DHBV infected and uninfected PDHs, and 51 protein spots have been identified by MS/MS analysis. Differential expression of beta-actin and annexin A2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and potential roles of some differentially expressed proteins in the viral infection have been discussed.",

The efficiency of DHBV infection in PDHs was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-DHBV preS monoclonal antibody. PDHs inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) as a control. At 12 h and 24 h after infection, only a few cells showed fluorescence (data not shown), and at 72 h post-infection about 30% of cells expressed viral large surface antigen, indicating that cells were infected with DHBV, showed in Figure 1. DHBV DNA in PDHs was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using an alpha-32P-dCTP labeled DHBV-specific probe, and DHBV in the supernatant was detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Single stranded forms of intracellular viral DNA and DHBV copy number increasing in the supernatant indicated the replication of DHBV 72 h and 120 h post-infection (Additional File 1 and 2).",

With a MASCOT cutoff score of 72 (p-value less than 0.05), 51 spots were identified, and 37 spots were matched to orthologous proteins of avian species (26 protein spots to Gallus gallus, 4 spots to Anas platyrhynchos and 7 spots to other avian species), listed in Table 1.

The hepadnavirus animal infection models such as ducks (DHBV) and woodchucks (WHBV) have been used to investigate the viral replication, pathogenesis or hepadnavirus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. DHBV-PDHs model is a valuable model of hepadnavirus infection with high reproducibility and efficiency [16]. In the present study, global changes in cellular protein expression in DHBV-infected PDHs were explored by 2-DE combined with MS/MS. Among the 75 differentially expressed protein spots, 51 spots have been identified by MS/MS corresponding to 42 proteins, in which 30 spots were matched to orthologous proteins of Gallus gallus or Anas platyrhynchos, 7 spots to other avian species, and 14 spots to non-avian species, while mass spectra of the other 24 protein spots did not match to any proteins in the current databases, possibly due to the incomplete genome sequence of Anas platyrhynchos or low abundance of those protein spots.",

Actin plays an active role in maturation of the viruses [29,30]. Many viruses require actin for viral entry and establishment of infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, Simian virus 40, and vaccinia virus [31-34]. However, the actin cortex beneath the plasma membrane can also be an obstacle for virus entry or budding [35]. It has been reported that DHBV entry depends on both intact microtubules and their dynamic turnover but not actin cytoskeleton [28]. Therefore the role of actin in DHBV replication is required to further investigation.",

Hsp70 assists folding of many newly synthesized polypeptides, and refolding of the proteins misfolded [41,42]. Hsp70 can enhance flock house virus replication [43,44]. Hsp70 and Hsp90 participate in dengue virus entry as a receptor complex [45]. Moreover, HBV P protein activation in vitro is fundamentally dependent on heat shock protein 70 family Hsc70/Hsp40 [46]. In HBV-replicating HepAD38 cell, expressions of heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90) and Mn superoxide dismutase increase, after HBV replication induced by tetracycline [47]. In humanized transgenic mice, inhibition of HBV replication results in suppression of Mn superoxide dismutase expression in hepatocytes [47,48].

It has been reported that HBV polymerase activity was inhibited by interacted with S100A10, a protein binding to annexin A2 [54]. In HepG2.2.15 compared with HepG2, annexin A2 was revealed down-regulated [55], which was consistent with our observation in DHBV-PDHs model and confirmed by Western blot analysis.

Forty-two differentially expressed proteins in DHBV infected PDHs have been identified by MS/MS. Most of them involve in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, stress responses and cytoskeleton processes including alpha-enolase, beta-actin, lamin A and annexin A2. It suggests that those proteins may play important roles in hepadnavirus infection. Differential expressions of annexin A2 and beta-actin were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Further investigation of the roles of the differentially expressed cellular proteins will help to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus infection.",
