            "text": "The coronavirus entry to the cell is a complex process, which requires a series of cellular factors. First, the virus binds to the attachment receptor. This interaction results in an increased cell surface density of virus particles and (or) facilitates interaction with the fusion receptor. To make an example, HCoV-OC43 and bovine coronavirus bind to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid4, HCoV-HKU1 binds to O-acetylated sialic acids5, while HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV bind to heparan sulfate proteoglycans6,7. In some cases this step seems to be redundant8, while in others depletion of the adhesion receptor results in lack of interaction between the virus and the cell and consequently severe decrease in virus infectivity6,9,10. Nonetheless, the presence of the adhesion factor is not sufficient to make the cell permissive. Coronaviruses utilize a broad variety of fusion receptors. Most of the alphacoronaviruses use aminopeptidase N (CD13) for cell entry, with the exception of HCoV-NL63, which similarly to SARS-CoV employs human angiotensin-converting enzyme 211. HCoV-OC43 was reported to utilize HLA class I molecule or sialic acids12,13, MERS-CoV - dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26)14, whereas the receptor for HCoV-HKU1 remains unknown5. Recognition of different receptors implies not only different cellular tropism, but also different internalization routes. It is worth to mention, however, that recent reports also stress the importance of other cellular factors for virus tissue specificity, including tissue-specific proteases15\u201318.",

The binding may induce fusion with cellular membranes, but in most of the cases this event is preceded by virus internalization via the endocytic route. The most common, and the best described route is clathrin-dependent endocytosis. This path is used by representatives of wide range of viral families (e.g., human enterovirus 7119, human metapneumovirus20, rabies virus21 and others). Upon receptor recognition, a viral particle is docked into a clathrin-coated pit. Its\u2019 formation is initialized by concerted action of a protein complex that consists of FCHo1/2, Eps15 and intersectin-1. FCHo1/2 induces curvature of the plasma membrane and through Eps15 recruits Adaptor Protein 2 (AP2) to the nucleation site22. AP2 assembles clathrin units and once their concentration reaches a critical level, they polymerize to form a lattice on the membrane23. The structure deepens, stabilized by the cargo24. Budding of the vesicle is accompanied by a tubular neck formation, to which amphiphysin protein is attracted. It recruits dynamin, which polymerizes in a GTP dependent mode to finally cut off the cargo-containing vesicle from the cell surface25,26.",

As shown in Fig. 1, addition of NH4Cl early during the infection resulted in reduction of the number of virus-positive cells.

            "text": "In order to ensure that HCoV-OC43 enters the cell using caveolae, specific inhibitors of this endosomal pathway were used. Caveolae are formed in membrane clusters, where caveolin-1 is accompanied by cholesterol and sphingolipids. Consequently, the caveolin-mediated entry is sensitive to cholesterol-binding or depleting agents such as nystatin or methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD). HCT-8 cells were pre-incubated with the compounds and overlaid with the virus. Following the incubation, cells were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained for HCoV-OC43 and actin, and virus entry was evaluated using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, incubation with M\u03b2CD and nystatin (Fig. 4B,C) resulted in significant retention of virus on the cell surface, further proving that caveolae are required for virus internalization. Cholera toxin was used as a reference (Fig. 4F,G), as it was previously reported to enter the cell via caveosomes31,32. The M\u03b2CD-mediated inhibition of HCoV-OC43 entry (Fig. 4B) was more effective than CTB (Fig. 4F). To ensure that the observed effect is specific, we silenced expression of caveolin-1 in HCT-8 cells using siRNAs delivered in two consecutive transfections. Scrambled siRNAs were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection, cells were incubated with HCoV-OC43 for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained to visualize the virus. In the cells transfected with caveolin-1 specific siRNAs protein levels were reduced by almost 80%, as assessed by Western blot, while scrambled siRNAs didn\u2019t influence the protein level. \u03b2-tubulin was used as a reference household gene (Fig. 5A; the original image of the membrane is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1). Virus internalization to cells depleted of caveolin-1 was evaluated by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, viral particles were retained on the cell surface in cells depleted of caveolin-1 (Fig. 5C), while no such effect was observed in control cells (Fig. 5B,D,E).",

Subsequently, cultures were fixed, permeabilized and stained with specific antibodies to visualize virus particles and actin cytoskeleton. Confocal imaging revealed that stabilization of actin cortex by jasplakinolide results in inhibition of HCoV-OC43 virus entry and dextran internalization (Fig. 8C,G). This may suggest that actin is important for vesicle formation, and the virus enters the cell by macropinocytosis. However, analysis of cells pre-treated with cytochalasin D revealed that depolymerization of actin filaments did not inhibit virus entry, but drastically modulated virus localization (Fig. 8B). Virus particle localized to non-structured actin deposits in the cell\u2019s cytoplasm. On the other hand, dextran internalization was hampered (Fig. 8F). Both inhibitors drastically limited virus infection rate, as shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 9). No inhibition of virus entry or infection was observed for wortmannin, PI3K inhibitor known to hamper macropinocytosis (Supplementary Fig. 3).",

Briefly, we used dextran (70 kDa) as a cargo reported to enter the cell by micropinocytosis and we tested its co-localization with HCoV-OC43 virions during the virus entry35. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, strong co-localization of HCoV-OC43 with dextran was observed 5\u2013210 min p.i. At the same time we observed vast decrease in HCoV-OC43 co-localization with EEA1 (early endosome\u2019s marker), what suggested that in the presence of dextran the virus is internalized by a different pathway. This triggered another question, whether the dextran-induced micropinocytosis may initiate productive infection. To address this question, cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 in the presence of dextran and nystatin or MiTMAB or NH4Cl. Infection was carried on for 3 days and its course was monitored with flow cytometry. Obtained results (Fig. 10) clearly show that although the virus effectively enters the cell by macropinocytosis, it is not able to reach the replication site and to start productive infection. Inhibition of caveolin-dependent endocytosis in the presence of dextran did not block virus nor dextran internalization, but it blocked virus replication.",

For that we checked whether the virus is able to fuse with cellular membrane on the cell surface or it requires prior internalization. It is generally believed that during internalization additional stimuli is provided due to acidification of the microenvironment and in some cases pH-dependent activation of proteases. Consequently, viruses sensitive to inhibitors preventing pH decrease are believed to require endocytosis for entry. We showed that bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride strongly inhibit virus replication (Fig. 1). One may, however, question whether during prolonged incubation only virus entry is affected. To ensure validity of our observation, subcellular localization of viruses entering the cell was tested and its co-localization with endosomal markers was verified. Obtained results confirmed that virions entering the cell co-localize with EEA1 molecule (Fig. 2), which is an established marker of early endosomes.",

Assembly of these structures depends on membrane content and flexibility, and we investigated the influence of compounds modifying cholesterol content/availability on HCoV-OC43 entry. Consistently, nystatin or M\u03b2CD pretreatment caused retention of the virus on the cell surface (Fig. 4). Both inhibitors blocked HCoV-OC43 infection, proving the relevance of this pathway for virus replication (Fig. 6).

To our surprise we recorded co-localization of these two cargoes (Supplementary Fig. 4). Subsequent examination revealed that in the presence of dextrans, which are also known inducers of macropinocytosis, the virus is switching the internalization route to macropinocytosis (Supplementary Fig. 4). It seems, however, that virus internalization by this route does not allow for effective entry and replication (Fig. 10). One may hypothesize that during micropinocytosis the pH in the vesicle is not decreased and the virus \u2013 cell fusion does not occur. In such a scenario, viruses are recycled to the cell surface or degraded intracellularly.
