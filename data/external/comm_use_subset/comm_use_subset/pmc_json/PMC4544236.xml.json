Through this the PLANET process effectively reduces a notoriously complex and multi\u2013dimensional task, which could be approached through an almost infinite number of \u201clenses\u201d, into an exercise in which 15 of the most important (and reasonably independent) criteria for priority setting are clearly defined.

Collective knowledge and crowdsourcing refer to the process of taking into account the collective input of a group of individuals rather than of a single expert (or small number of experts) to answer a question [12]. This is based on the observation that the average of collective judgments is closer to the truth than any single expert judgment in most circumstances [12]. The pre\u2013requisites for this process to work are: (i) diversity of opinion (each person should have private information even if it is just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts); (ii) independence (people\u2019s opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them); (iii) decentralization (people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge); and (iv) aggregation (some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision \u2013 in this case, the PLANET method) [12]. Once each individual is given an opportunity to express their opinion in a way that is treated equally with respect to the opinion of any other individual, then the personal biases that those individuals bring into the process tend to cancel and dilute each other regardless of who the participants are. What is left is information based on the accumulated knowledge, lifetime experience and common sense of those who took part. This collective knowledge illustrates that disagreement and contest, rather than consensus and compromise, among independent minds can lead to the best decisions [12].",

In this process, the funding can be thought of the \u201cenergy\u201d or \u201cresource\u201d required to fill the gaps in development, while all steps through which these funds need to be taken during this process can be seen as potentially retarding forces which may cause deviations from the most effective approach. These forces do not disappear even if more money is injected into the system. A problem is that, in reality, we neither have the detailed evidence nor the information required for the optimization of the process of DAH, nor can we monitor and centrally coordinate the flows of funding.",

The second function is \u2018managing\u2019 and is concerned with the management or pooling of those funds, as well as with mechanisms for channeling funds to recipients (the managers of DAH). The third function is \u2018spending\u2019 and is concerned with expenditure and consumption of those funds (the recipients of DAH). It is worth noting that while this schematic establishes a clear time sequence of the key events in the DAH process, several actors work across all three levels simultaneously. Nevertheless, similar to McCoy et al. 2009 [14], we believe that these categories provide a useful framework for studying the DAH process.",

First, donors could misalign the size of their support (financial commitment) with the size of the problem (burden of disease). An unprecedented amount of money is being pledged and used to fund health services throughout the world. However, several studies have shown that funding does not correspond closely to burden [2]. For example, Shiffman demonstrates that within communicable diseases for the years 1996 to 2003, there were several neglected topics such as acute respiratory infections and malaria [15]. Similarly, Sridhar & Batniji noted that in 2005, funding per death varied widely by disease area from US$ 1029.10 for HIV/AIDS to US$ 3.21 for non\u2013communicable disease [16]. The reasons for this misalignment could be due to the social construction of the problem [17], lobbying by vested interests [18] or the personal interests of donors [19]. Thus, the risk that the donors are misaligning their financial commitment to a disease area with the burden it causes needs to be assessed.",

Instead of examining how the existing institutional infrastructure \u2013specifically the WHO and World Bank \u2013 can be reformed to deliver on projects, new initiatives are launched that attempt to compensate for their shortcomings [24]. For example, the World Bank has an important role to play in DAH given its long history working in countries through governments, as well as in its knowledge\u2013bank role. Similarly the WHO is unique in being governed by 193 member states and its role in setting evidence\u2013based norms on technical and policy matters, highlighting best practices that improve health globally and monitoring and coordinating action.

As McCoy et al. discuss, global health is a multi\u2013billion dollar industry, and there are clearly competing interests amongst different actors to make use of this funding [14]. For example, pharmaceutical companies appear to benefit considerably from global health programs that emphasize the delivery of medical commodities and treatments. NGOs, global health research institutions and UN bureaucracies also have an interest in increasing or maintaining their level of income and thus tend to prefer that funding from major donors flows through them (as managers of funding), rather than directly to developing countries. Further scrutiny is needed on aid flows in global health to assess whether they are being captured by vested interests and used to support inappropriate spending on the private commercial sector or on a large and costly global health bureaucracy and technocracy. Thus, the risk that a development project will be designed in a way that results in too much funding going to costly organizations needs to be established.",

We can now, in real\u2013time, in almost every country or setting collect feedback or opinions from an estimated 6.8 billion people who actively use mobile phones (with the proportion of smartphones rapidly growing) [36]. This can be done through text\u2013message [37,38], automated phone calls, dedicated apps, email or the internet in a device or platform agnostic manner. It is certain that this is redefining not just the norms of who provides a feedback or communication of their assessment of a programme and how and when this is done, but also how DAH and indeed health care is delivered or consumed. The PLANET questionnaire is currently being developed into an app that would be freely available to all governments, international institutions and individuals looking for a simple, tech\u2013friendly tool to plan, monitor and evaluate DAH.",

First, it presents a standardized methodology that can be used for planning, monitoring and evaluation of any type of DAH project, but it also has sufficient flexibility to be tailored to the context of specific projects or initiatives. PLANET would be an additional tool available to policy\u2013makers, along with LiST (for health care/interventions) [39] and CHNRI (for health research) [13] which will involve local experts and incorporate issues of local context in the process of determining priorities in a transparent, user\u2013friendly, replicable, quantifiable and specific, algorithm\u2013like manner. Second, it is simple to implement and with the development of mobile\u2013phone software, should be able to be run anywhere in the world at low\u2013cost. The low\u2013cost of input means it can be run multiple times resulting in real\u2013time monitoring of DAH. Third, while respondents are protected through anonymity in feedback, the results are provided transparently. Finally, the exercise gives equal voice to all those involved in the process of development from the donor (eg, in London, Seoul or Seattle) to a manager and to a recipient (in rural Uganda, Dhaka or Antigua). The voice of local stakeholders, including operations teams and beneficiaries, is included in every exercise.",
