            "text": "\nIn Type I diabetes, the insulin-producing islets of Langerhans, scattered throughout the pancreas, are selectively destroyed by an apparent autoimmune process. Daily and often multiple injections of exogenous human recombinant insulin are the current standard of care. Despite continual advances in insulin therapy and the fact that some patients have now survived for more than 50 years with insulin therapy, the quality of life can be difficult owing to the nonphysiological delivery of an insulin bolus. The transplantation of the entire human pancreas from a deceased organ donor provides another therapeutic option for diabetic patients, especially, for those patients already receiving immunosuppressive therapy for a kidney allograft [1]. Alternatively, the insulin-producing islets can be isolated from the majority of the pancreas and transplanted alone as free islets [2]. As noted above, a necessary component of the transplantation of an allogeneic pancreas or the islets alone is the need for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Because complications from such immunosuppressive therapy can include increased susceptibility to infections, malignancy, neurotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity, allotransplantation must be carefully considered and is often not suitable for young patients [3]. Further, the availability of human donor pancreas is extremely limited with only about 2,000 pancreas donors per year [4]. Worse, only about 16% of procured pancreases meet the criteria for transplantation and less than 3% are used for islet isolation [4, 5].",

The use of pigs as an islet source provides an unlimited number of organs for islet isolation and encapsulation. Further, porcine insulin is nearly identical to human insulin, differing in only a single amino acid and it has been used in the clinic since its discovery in 1922 [7]. The double layered agarose encapsulation of the porcine islets also provides at least some protection from recipient immune responses to the xenogeneic islets and is likely to ameliorate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. In fact, we have previously shown the porcine islet macrobeads to enable the discontinuation of exogenous insulin for more than 6 months (study termination) in spontaneously diabetic BB rats without immunosuppressive therapy [6].",

After electrical stun and exsanguination (Bob Evans Farms, Xenia, OH), pancreata were retrieved and transported to the islet isolation laboratory in cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; Mediatech, 21-020) on ice. Warm ischemia times averaged 12.26 minutes while cold ischemia times ranged from 30 minutes to one hour. Islet isolation was carried out as previously described [6]. Briefly, after trimming the gland of fat and connective tissue, the main pancreatic duct was cannulated and injected with HBSS containing 2.0 g/L collagenase P (Roche, 11213873001) and 0.01 g/L DNase (Sigma Aldrich, D5025). Twice the gram weight of the pancreas (in mL) was perfused through the pancreatic duct at a rate of 50 mL/min at 18\u00b0C. Islets were purified on discontinuous Eurocollins (Mediatech, Inc., 99-408)-Ficoll (Sigma Aldrich, F9378) gradients of densities 1.105 g/cm3, 1.095 g/cm3, and 1.055 g/cm3 in 50 mL polystyrene conical tubes. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000 RPM, and islet-containing layers were manually collected. 500 islet equivalents were encapsulated in each agarose-agarose macrobead as previously described [6]. Islet macrobeads were maintained in RPMI containing 2.5% porcine serum (Mediatech, 35-041) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (A/A; Gibco Life Technologies, 15240) in an atmosphere of 3\u20135% CO2 and air at 36\u201338\u00b0C. Macrobeads were examined for uniformity, collected the day prior to implant, and were aliquoted to 175 mL conical tubes.

Insulin production during a 24 hr period of in vitro culture was determined once a week prior to macrobead implantation for each batch of islet macrobeads (see below) so that an average quantity of insulin secretion per macrobead in the four weeks prior to each implant could be calculated (see Table 3).

As insulin production varies with every batch of islet macrobeads, each preparation of islet macrobeads was evenly divided amongst the different recipient dogs such that each animal received a proportion of each batch of macrobeads based on exogenous insulin requirements.

Importantly, specific immunosuppressive therapy was not administered, although pravastatin was given for its mild anti-inflammatory properties. All three dogs that received porcine islet macrobeads were insulin-free for approximately 2 weeks following the first implant procedure. Preimplant insulin requirements were reached over the following week such that by three weeks after implantation all animals were again on full insulin requirements. Remarkably, the implanted dogs did not reach pre-insulin requirements following the second implant, until significantly longer periods of time. In fact, one animal still had not reached preimplant insulin requirements, at necropsy, on day 652 following 2nd implant.",

In the case of porcine islets, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) is encoded throughout the porcine genome, and because it is unlikely to be removed, this virus has generated considerable attention of the xenotransplantation community and regulatory authorities (see review by Denner and Tonjes [16]). Although PERV was shown to infect human cells in vitro [17], there is no evidence of transmission to humans including farmers, veterinarians, or abattoir workers, all of whom are exposed daily to numerous porcine secretions, excretions, blood, and tissues. More than 80 years of using porcine insulin in the clinic has also not revealed any transmission of PERV. Preclinical studies in nonhuman primates have also not detected any evidence of PERV transmission [18] even with high dose immunosuppression and high titers of PERV [19]. Also assuring are the negative human clinical findings of PERV transmission to date including burn patients treated with porcine skin [20], patients with hemophilia treated with porcine factor VIII [21], and patients receiving extracorporeal porcine hepatocyte therapy [22\u201324], as well as from two clinical trials of porcine islets following implantation [25, 26]. Nonetheless, the accidental transmission of animal viruses and PERV in particular mandate a carefully thought out strategy to manage such risks [27, 28].",

Traditional organ allografting techniques do not allow for the extended testing times required to assure the absence of xenorelated infectious diseases, and until now, the promise of islet xenotransplantation has been largely unrealized by this restraint. The agarose-agarose islet macrobead affords ample time for extensive microbiological safety testing. We consider this an advanced technique to the antemortem screening of donor animals because the tissue to be transplanted can be tested directly. This is a significant technological advance and one with the potential to finally make xenotransplantation a reality. Furthermore, additional patient safety is obtained by not requiring the immunosuppression of macrobead recipients [30].",

All tissues were found to be negative for the screened viral sequences although some low level amplification was observed for PCV in some tissues of all dogs including the nonimplanted control animals. As low level amplification signals for the PCV target were detected in both negative control and macrobead implanted animals, it is likely that this finding is due to a cross-reaction with canine specific sequences. The negative findings from the extensive viral screening of the islet macrobeads prior to implantation also support the notion that porcine islet macrobead implantation, under the conditions of this study, can be performed safely and does not result in trans-species viral transmission.",

At necropsy, most islet macrobeads were intact and free-floating in the peritoneal cavity. Only one animal had any evidence of a broken macrobead(s). These results demonstrate the ability of the islet macrobeads to resist breakage in vivo. Perhaps the most impressive finding at necropsy was the mild degree of inflammatory reaction in the peritoneal cavity which was not thought to impair organ function. Furthermore, these data also demonstrate the capacity of the abdomen to accommodate a large number of macrobeads. Ongoing improvements in the insulin secretion capacity of each islet macrobead continue to allow for the implantation of fewer macrobeads in order to replace exogenous insulin. Finally, current clinical trials of a similarly sized mouse renal adenocarcinoma-containing agarose macrobead for the inhibition of various cancers have shown the human abdomen to easily house several thousand such macrobeads [32, 33].",
