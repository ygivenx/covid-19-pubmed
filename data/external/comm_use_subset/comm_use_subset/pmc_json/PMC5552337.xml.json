            "text": "Enveloped virus-cell entry requires glycoprotein-catalyzed fusion of viral and host cell membranes. These viral fusion glycoproteins are catalytically-inactive on virus particles and become triggered to mediate membrane mergers only in response to cellular and environmental factors. This triggering process ensures that virus-cell entry occurs at the appropriate time and place. The triggering factors include host cell receptors, endosomal acids, and proteases. Many viruses require a single, soluble trigger, for example, influenza A virus fusion proteins are triggered by protons within the target-cell endosome [1]. Other viruses require two triggering agents, for example, avian sarcoma leukosis virus fusion proteins are partially advanced into fusion-catalyzing forms after binding to host cell receptors, and then fully execute fusion after being exposed to endosomal protons [2]. Most CoVs also require two triggering agents, receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage, with the proteolysis taking place on receptor-bound viral ligands [3]. As many of the CoV-cleaving proteases are transmembrane-anchored, it follows that CoV-susceptible cells might have the two triggering agents, receptors and proteases, in close proximity. Here we considered whether the two CoV entry factors are coalesced on cell surfaces to facilitate infection, and whether particular host cell features are required to juxtapose the two entry factors.",

Proteases, the second required determinants of host susceptibility, are variable in type and subcellular location [8], with proteases in the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family figuring prominently [8\u201310]. TTSP family members, most notably the transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), can cleave CoV fusion glycoproteins (termed spike [S] proteins), into unlocked, fusion-catalyzing forms [8, 9, 11] at the cell surface and facilitate a rapid, \u201cearly\u201d entry. Studies examining HIV [12] and influenza [13] glycoproteins indicate that multiple adjacent fusion glycoproteins must be activated in order to successfully complete the fusion reaction. Assuming similar requirements for CoV fusion, it is likely that multiple S proteins need simultaneous receptor engagement and sufficient proteolytic cleavage to form an activated cluster that can pull opposing membranes together. Thus, fusion likely occurs in regions of the cell membrane with a relatively high local concentration of these entry factors.",

Tetraspanins comprise a family of proteins with four transmembrane spans and two extracellular loops [15]. Tetraspanins interact with other tetraspanins [16] and with other membrane-associated proteins [17, 18], including transmembrane proteases [19, 20], to form \u201cwebs\u201d of interacting proteins [15]. There is evidence that these tetraspanin webs are locus points for CoV-cell entry, as tetraspanin-specific antibodies protect several cell types from CoV infection [14]. However, it remains unclear if individual tetraspanin proteins facilitate CoV entry and what function they have in determining viral entry routes. As there are demonstrations that the tetraspanin CD9 interacts with the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [21, 22] and hints of similar CD9 interactions with the HCoV-229E receptor aminopeptidase N (APN) [23], we hypothesized that CD9 is necessary to bring these virus receptors to TTSP-enriched regions on the cell surface.",

Indeed, there are 34 human tetraspanins and at least 17 members of the TTSP protease family [24] as well as several soluble extracellular proteases, such as elastases [25], that may be expressed in the lung parenchyma. While studies suggest that TMPRSS2 can trigger MERS-CoV in cell culture [9, 25], it is unclear whether CD9 or TMPRSS2 stand out in vivo as single proviral members of their respective protein families. Therefore, we set out to determine whether, and to what extent, MERS-CoV utilizes CD9 and TMPRSS2 during in vivo infection. To this end, we established a mouse model in which virus-resistant mice are rendered susceptible to MERS-CoV infection by expression of human DPP4 (hDPP4). The system utilizes a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) to transduce the hDPP4 gene, thereby sensitizing only the Ad5-transduced lung cells to subsequent MERS-CoV infection [26]. The rAd5-hDPP4 vectors were engineered to include additional genes encoding the potential virus-promoting factor human TMPRSS2 [9] or potential virus-restricting factors, in the form of shRNAs targeting murine Tmprss2 and Cd9. We considered the rAd5-hDPP4 system to be especially valuable, as MERS-CoV infection can only occur in cells expressing hDPP4 and, thus, only in cells simultaneously expressing the putative virus-promoting or virus-restricting factors.",

Our results indicate that a CoV-cell entry portal is a multipartite complex that minimally includes the virus receptor, a virus-activating protease, and one or more tetraspanins. These complexes are responsible for the majority of MERS-CoV entry in lung cells. Furthermore, CD9 facilitated cell entry by MERS-CoV spikes that were adapted for lung virulence, but CD9 provided no support to cell culture-derived, avirulent spike-mediated cell entry.

All KO cell lines grew equivalent to parallel \u201cWT\u201d control clones, and the only observable distinctions were with the CD9KO cells, which adhered less tightly to plastic than WT or CD81KO cells. Western blot analyses of the WT and KO clones confirmed the absence of CD9 or CD81, with maintenance of a control tetraspanin CD63 (Fig 1A). Interestingly, CD81 levels were highest in CD9KO cells and CD9 levels were low in CD81KO cells, possibly due to heterotypic CD9-CD81 interactions influencing tetraspanin stability. Lower-resolution immunofluorescent assays (IFAs) of umpermeabilized cells showed similar cell-surface CD9 in WT and CD81KO cells, confirmed the absence of the respective tetraspanins in KO cells, and demonstrated that CD63 distribution remained unchanged in all cell lines (Fig 1B).",

We considered whether CD9 associates with DPP4 and APN, the MERS-CoV and 229E-CoV receptors, or with TMPRSS2. Furthermore, we considered whether CD9 does not interact with ACE2 and CEACAM, the receptors for CD9-independent SARS and MHV-CoVs. This was first investigated through biochemical isolation of tetraspanin-enriched membrane fractions, and detection of tetraspanin-associated receptors and proteases. To this end, CD9 or CD81 KO cells overexpressing CoV receptors or TMPRSS2 were surface-biotinylated, and tetraspanins were liberated from cells using zwitterionic CHAPS detergent, which solubilizes cell membranes while leaving tetraspanin-mediated protein interactions largely intact [30]. Low-Density (LD) fractions, with \u03c1<1.13 g/ml, were then separated from High-Density (HD) CHAPS-solubilized proteins on sucrose density gradients [31]. As evaluated by streptavidin pull-down and western immunoblotting, the LD sucrose gradient fractions from CHAPS-solubilized cells contained nearly 100% of cell-surface tetraspanins (S3 Fig), but only ~ 20% of the surface-biotinylated plasma membrane proteins [14], indicating efficient tetraspanin segregation into LD fractions.",

The presence or absence of CD81 had no effect on DPP4 distribution between HD and LD fractions (Fig 2A, rows 4 and 5). Similar results were observed with the 229E receptor APN (Fig 2B). By contrast, CD9 and CD81 expression had little effect on the distribution of ACE2, CEACAM, or TMPRSS2, all of which distributed about equally between LD and HD fractions (Fig 2C\u20132E).

We performed proximity ligation assays (PLAs), which can determine whether two or more transmembrane proteins are adjacent [32]. In PLAs, antibodies differentially tagged with oligonucleotide probes are applied to cells, and their close spacing (<40 nm) allows for probe hybridization into DNA polymerization templates, which provide a locus point for fluorescent DNA synthesis [33].

When CD9 was replenished in the CD9KO cells, foci were ~10-fold more abundant (Fig 3D), and these increased foci correlated with a greater cell susceptibility to MERSpp transduction (Fig 3H). These findings argue that CD9 sensitizes cells to MERS-CoV entry by bringing DPP4 and TMPRSS2 into proximity. We considered whether this role for CD9 applied only when DPP4 and TMPRSS2 levels were low, i.e., at endogenous HeLa-cell levels. Thus, hDPP4 and hTMPRSS2 were forcibly overexpressed; with overexpression, ~ 30 foci/cell were observed (Fig 3E), and this increased to ~ 80 foci/cell in the presence of CD9 (Fig 3F). MERSpp entry into cells correlated with the number of foci present, at least for values up to ~ 30 foci/cell (Fig 3H). Overall, these results indicated that CD9 connects DPP4 and TMPRSS2 entry factors, and is necessary for their proximity when they are sparse on cell surfaces. The CD9:DPP4:TMPRSS2 complexes then function as MERS-CoV entry portals. CD9 also helped to connect overexpressed DPP4 and TMPRSS2 together, but in this overexpression condition, CD9 did not increase MERSpp transduction, perhaps because other tetraspanins come in to bridge the abundant receptors and proteases. These results also revealed CD9-directed DPP4:TMPRSS2 complexes on intact cells in the absence of virus, suggesting that the CoVs infect through pre-existing complexes.",

To test this, we blocked late entry in WT and CD9KO with 100 \u03bcM bafilomycin A (Baf), an inhibitor of endosome acidification, or with 10 \u03bcM E64D, a cysteine protease inhibitor. In WT cells, Baf did not significantly decrease MERSpp entry, while E64D decreased entry ~4-fold (Fig 4B). However, in CD9KO cells, these inhibitors were far more antiviral, decreasing entry 20- and 100-fold, respectively. Complementing CD9 back into the CD9KO cells restored the WT phenotype in which the inhibitors were only weakly antiviral (Fig 4B). These differential effects of the inhibitors were not observed in CD81KO or CD81-overexpressing cells (Fig 4B). We conclude that CD9 is necessary for TTSP-mediated MERS early entry.",

Of note, a previous study has demonstrated that camostat inhibits SARS-CoV spread in mouse lungs [36], suggesting that the virus exhibits dependence on serine proteases, probably TTSPs, for its entry in vivo. However, the importance of specific TTSPs, or for tetraspanins, is unknown for any in vivo CoV infection. Here we established infections in the mouse lung under conditions in which putative CoV entry factors were reduced. To do this, we developed dual-expressing recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5) vectors expressing both human DPP4, which sensitizes mouse cells to MERS-CoV infection [26, 37, 38], and shRNAs that knock down Tmprss2 or Cd9 mRNAs. In initial experiments, these rAd5 vectors were transduced into mouse Lung Epithelial Type 1 (LET-1) cells, a line derived from C57/Bl6 mouse alveolar type 1 cells [39]. After 3-days, the cells were analyzed for the presence of hDPP4, TMPRSS2, and CD9 by western blot (Fig 5A). Relative to the control rAd5-GFP transductions, all single and dual-expressing rAd5-hDPP4 transductants contained recognizable DPP4 and TMPRSS2, and those Ad5 vectors expressing shRNAs reduced the levels of endogenous CD9 proteins (Fig 5A). Due to endogenous TMPRSS2 protein levels being too low for detection on immunoblots, we used qRT-PCR to quantify TMPRSS2 transcripts. LET-1 cells transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-shTmprss2 had only 25% of the transcripts of cells transduced with rAd5-hDPP4-empty vector (Fig 5B). This level of Tmprss2 transcripts indicated an efficient knockdown of TMPRSS2 in the approximately 75% of cells that were successfully transduced. These results indicate that the different rAd5 vectors, transduced into cells derived from mouse alveolar epithelia, consistently express equivalent levels of hDPP4, while simultaneously increasing or decreasing TMPRSS2 or CD9.",

Relative to MERS-CoV titers in rAd5-hDPP4 transduced animals, the MERS-CoV titers in rAd5-hDPP4-shCd9 transduced animals were ~20-fold lower (Fig 5D). Furthermore, the MERS-CoV titers in rAd5-hDPP4-shTmprss2 transduced mice were reduced by ~10-fold. Interestingly, overexpression of TMPRSS2 by the rAd5-hDPP4-TMPRSS2 vector had no effect on MERS-CoV titers in the lungs, presumably because the lung environment has sufficient endogenous murine TMPRSS2 to facilitate efficient MERS-CoV infection. These data indicate that CD9 and TMPRSS2 act as MERS-CoV susceptibility factors in the lung parenchyma and that their role in entry is slightly more pronounced in vivo than in in vitro LET-1 mouse alveolar cell cultures. Indeed, these data show that CD9 and TMPRSS2 are responsible for ~90% of MERS-CoV titers in vivo.",

Relative to CCA MERS-CoVs, the Mouse-Adapted (MA) viruses have distinct S protein changes [44](S2 Table). We considered whether these MA changes fixed into S proteins adapt viruses to utilize CD9-facilitated early entry. To address this question, we produced VSV-based MERSpps, pseudotyped with the CCA or MA S proteins. These CCA and MA MERSpps were transduced into CD9-replete or CD9-knocked down (CD9KD) LET-1 cells. The CD9-replete and CD9KD cells were equally susceptible to CCA S-mediated pp entry. However, the same CD9KD cells had 90% and >95% reduced susceptibility to MA1 and MA2 S-driven pp entry, respectively (Fig 6A).

By incorporating RNA silencing genes into rAd5-hDPP4, we were able to simultaneously establish MERS-CoV susceptibility, through hDPP4 expression, and potentially restrict MERS-CoV, through shRNA-mediated suppression of candidate proviral factors. Thus, the dual-expressing rAd5 vectors revealed CD9 and TMPRSS2 as relevant proviral factors, operating to support the primary hDPP4 susceptibility factor. It is notable that dual-expressing adenovirus vectors can potentially be utilized to identify any MERS-CoV host factor. Indeed, they can be utilized to identify host factors in any virus-host system that requires an exogenously supplied susceptibility determinant. Furthermore, the adenovirus transduction process bypasses the need to establish partially humanized mice for studies of human coronavirus infections, and actually has distinct advantages over transgenic animals, in that shRNAs reduce pro- or anti-viral factors solely in coronavirus-infectable cells, making for reliable measurements of changes in virus susceptibility. We expect that dual-expressing rAd5 vectors will be excellent general tools to rapidly identify in vivo pro- and anti-viral host factors.",

            "text": "The hDPP4:CD9:TMPRSS2 complexes promoted an \u201cearly\u201d MERS-CoV entry. CoV S proteins require simultaneous receptor engagement and proteolysis before catalyzing virus-cell membrane fusion [3, 47, 48], a process demanding that TMPRSS2 be closely juxtaposed to hDPP4. We suggest that CD9 tetraspanins position TMPRSS2 next to the receptor-bound S proteins, perhaps in association with cholesterol, a lipid having profound effects on both tetraspanin structural interactions [49] and CoV entry [50\u201354]. Precisely how TMPRSS2 abuts against hDPP4 to access S proteins is not clear, although the structures of three CoV S proteins [55, 56] and hDPP4 [57] indicate that the proteolytic cleavage sites would be displayed at the outer edges of each S trimer. Furthermore, it is likely that proteolytic cleavage of several adjacent S proteins is needed to activate membrane fusion, as cooperative \u201cpulling\u201d by several viral fusion proteins is frequently required for virus entry processes [12, 13, 58]. Therefore, the tetraspanin-enriched environment, in which DPP4 and TMPRSS2 are collected together, likely permits rapid and simultaneous cleavage of multiple, closely-spaced virion S proteins, generating clusters of activated S proteins that drive the membrane fusion process.",

            "text": "Without CD9, the hDPP4 and TMPRSS2 are not held closely together (Fig 3). In this condition, MERS-CoV still infects hDPP4-positive target cells (Fig 3), but it takes a slower \u201clate\u201d endosomal route, which we and others find to be around 90% less efficient than early entry (Figs 1, 5 and 6) [25]. In the late entry route, virus-associated S proteins are first endocytosed and then cleavage-activated by furin proprotein convertases [59, 60], cathepsin L [8, 25, 61, 62], and/or cathepsin B [63]. However, the protease-enriched endo-lysosomal environment [64] can also generate inactivating CoV S protein cleavages, as evidenced by C-terminal S protein fragments, 40 kDa and smaller, that must be inactivated fusion domain fragments [48, 65]. Therefore, in the late entry route, there may be a short time span between a cathepsin-activated fusogenic state and a permanently inactivated, excessively proteolyzed state, accounting for inefficient entry. Inefficient late entry may also be explained by differences in lysosomal and plasma membranes, which have unique lipid profiles [66] and therefore may be differentially susceptible to S -catalyzed fusion. Finally, late entry is restricted by interferon-induced gene products, notably interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins [67, 68], but early TTSP-facilitated entry is not [8]. All of these virus-restricting conditions may combine in vivo to make CD9-facilitated \u201cearly\u201d cell entry the predominant route for MERS-CoV infections.",

Additionally, clinical HCoV-229E isolates use a rapid TTSP-facilitated entry route, unlike lab-adapted HCoV-229Es [45]. More recently, similar patterns were observed for MERS-CoVs. Mouse lung-adapted MERS-CoVs take a rapid TMPRSS2-mediated cell entry, while cell culture-adapted (CCA) MERS-CoVs are avirulent and enter cells through the slower and less efficient endocytic route [44]. Here we demonstrated that the virulent MA MERS-CoV S proteins utilized CD9 during cell entry, while avirulent CCA viruses did not. This new finding suggests that CoV receptors and proteases alone are not the selective agents in CoV adaptation. Rather, the CoVs adapt to the ternary receptor-tetraspanin-protease complexes. In the case of MERS-CoV, the key adaptive S mutation facilitating the usage of the ternary complexes was at position 1015 (S2 Table). In the MERS-CoV S protein cryo-EM structure [55, 56, 69], this residue 1015 is part of a peptide that connects two of the helices comprising the fusion domain. The change from N1015 to T may ease restrictions to conformational change in the S trimer, thereby exposing cleavage sites to the nearby CD9-associated transmembrane protease, with cleaved spikes then converting to fusion-active forms.",

Four CoV receptors (DPP4, APN, ACE2, and CEACAM) were found in tetraspanin-rich membrane fractions (Fig 4), and our previous report indicated that tetraspanin antibodies block several CoV infections by interfering with receptor-associated CoV access to surface proteases [14]. Even antibodies binding to CD81 suppressed MERS S-mediated entry [14], indicating that several tetraspanins, including those that are not required per se for clustering hDPP4 and TMPRSS2, organize into cell-surface \u201cwebs\u201d [15] and enclose the CoV entry factors. Here, there may be parallels with several tetraspanin-facilitated viruses, including influenza A (IAV) [28] and canine distemper (CDV) [70]; the retroviruses HIV [71, 72], feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) [73], and human T-lymphocytic virus 1 (HTLV-1) [74]; herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) [75]; hepatitis C virus [76]; and several human papillomaviruses (HPVs) [77]. For these viruses, tetraspanins facilitate viral entry (CoVs, IAVs, HCV, HPVs) syncytia formation (CDV, HIV, FIV, HTLV-1), or promote viral exit (IAVs, HSV-1 and HIV), by unclear mechanisms. Conceivably, a common mechanism may involve tetraspanin-mediated clustering of host factors. For example, tetraspanin CD81 is both an HCV receptor [78] and a linker of the HCV co-receptors scavenger receptor class B I (SR-BI) [76] and claudin-1 [79], whose complexing promotes viral endocytosis (reviewed in [80]). Another example is with the tetraspanins CD151 and CD63, which do not directly interact with HPVs, but rather hold several co-receptors together to permit HPV binding and endocytosis (reviewed in [81]. Therefore, many of the proviral activities ascribed to tetraspanins may relate to their ability to cluster transmembrane proteins, as we have found for the pro-MERS-CoV activity of CD9. Given that several viruses depend on tetraspanin webs, it may be useful to consider ways to target entry-blocking drugs to these locations and thereby increase their antiviral efficacy.",
