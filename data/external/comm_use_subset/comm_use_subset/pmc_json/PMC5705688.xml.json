Previous studies were usually performed in ARI cases, especially in outpatients.10, 11 Noteworthily, compared with the definition of ARI (presence of constitutional signs or symptom of respiratory tract infection, ie, cough and fast breathing), the criteria of SARI puts more focus on the hospitalized severe cases. As expected, infants and young child <5 years old showed the highest infection rate of HPIVs in all SARI cases, which concur with the studies carried out in ARIs. However, the high yield rate of HPIVs in elder population was observed: 6.02% (25/415) of SARI cases over 60 years old were HPIV\u2010positive, which was higher than that in mild ARI cases.11 Although the HPIV infection usually presents as mild and self\u2010limiting illness, and no ICU\u2010treated cases and death were reported in this study, elder patients still bear a high risk in HPIV infection, due to their complex underlying diseases and relatively low immune response.

Two major surface glycoproteins, the HN and the fusion (F) proteins, are essential for virus assembly.1 In particular, HN glycoprotein regulates the interaction between virus and host cells and possesses the largest antigenicity in host immunity against HPIV infection(12). Several antigenic epitopes of the HN glycoprotein have been previously characterized.12, 13 Three amino acid substitutions in antigenic epitopes were found in this study, including K168R (16.67%), H295Y (100%), and I391V (100%). In particular, the K168R mutation locates very close to amino acids of significant importance to the integrity of distinct HN epitopes (residues 171),14 and it has not been identified in Asia before.
