Second, to find additional details for each case or patient we augment these data with online reports, mainly captured through news websites (e.g., https://www.163.com) or via news aggregators (e.g., https://bnonews.com/). We recorded all data sources in our database. Third, in some instances more detailed data are available, typically through peer-reviewed research articles1,7, which were subsequently used to modify existing records in the database.

Those include, for example, that some Chinese provinces reported new cases more than once a day, with each report providing only new data. Other provinces provided updates throughout the day and then provided a final update listing all new cases, inclusive of earlier reports. In the latter case, entry of all the newly reported cases would result in duplication of cases from earlier updates. Additionally, as countries began to report asymptomatic PCR-positive individuals, their referencing or indexing of patients sometimes changed. For example, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health identified novel coronavirus pneumonia cases ordinally up to the country\u2019s eighth case. The next three cases were identified during testing of a Japanese national flown from Wuhan on a charter flight for repatriation. One of those cases became the Ministry of Health\u2019s ninth case while the other two were asymptomatic and not considered the 10th and 11th cases in their press release. As this distinction was not made in other countries, the practice was documented to avoid confusion of cases in the line-list.",

All geographic metadata was standardized via the use of a common geographic reference table. New unique distinct locations were added to the reference table, and all subsequent entries had geographic information populated from this table. Location names are often duplicated within a country, so contextual information was used to ensure the correct site was selected. When the site name was not found, information from the text was also used to scan sites in the approximate area to check for alternate spellings of the site name. We had curators skilled with the following languages: English, mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Spanish, and Portuguese. To add new geographies to the database, Google Maps (https://www.maps.google.co.uk) and Google Earth (http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/earth) were used to determine latitude and longitudes, and relevant administrative metadata was extracted by querying the relevant country reference shapefile. For locations that are administrative units, information was populated by referring to the country reference shapefile, sourced primarily from GADM (https://gadm.org/) with the admin_id field to allow for easier polygon selection.",

The epidemiological situation regarding the COVID-19 outbreak is continuously evolving. We therefore have made available an archive data folder through our Github repository where new data is uploaded. Each of the rows represents a single individual case and ID. A description of the fields in the database is shown below and is available through a data dictionary on Github (https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019/covid19):",

Duplicate are defined as cases that refer to the same case. Code for these methods is hosted on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019/covid19).

This is most likely to happen when looking at point data. We have provided sources consulted so that users may cross-reference the original source wherever this is may be an issue. While administrative units are supplied with shapefiles sources and unique identifiers with these files so that users can understand the corresponding geographic scale which the row represents, with points, different settlements cover different spatial extents. Should users wish to incorporate this information into spatially-dependent models, they should exercise caution in possible misrepresentation of geographic specificity.
