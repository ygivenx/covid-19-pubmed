We cannot predict which children will recover quickly versus those who will progress to severe ARDS. No ARDS-specific pharmacological treatments exist, rather treatment is supportive using lung-protective ventilation strategies and the administration of antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. The study of immune regulation in children is needed because both the lung and immunity are maturing during this critical stage of development and the primary cause of PARDS is direct lung injury due to infection1,2.",

Airway neutrophils from adults with ARDS have enhanced survival, a primed respiratory burst response, and increased phagocytic capacity5. In patients with pulmonary diseases characterized by chronic bacterial infections, such as cystic fibrosis, airway neutrophils inhibit T-cell function via two pathways \u2014 by depletion of arginine following degranulation and activation of Arginase-1 (Arg1), and by activation of the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 (PD-1) axis, resulting in reduced proliferation and impaired effector functions6\u201315.

Understanding the biology of neutrophils recruited to the lung during PARDS is crucial for advancing prognostication, risk stratification, and development of novel therapeutic strategies for children who progress to severe PARDS. Herein we hypothesized that markers of degranulation on the surface of airway neutrophils and in the cell-free airway fluid within 24-hours of intubation would be associated with bacterial respiratory co-infection. We used an in vitro model based on blood neutrophil transepithelial migration into the airway fluid of endotracheally intubated children with suspected or confirmed lower airway viral infections at risk for progressing to or with PARDS16. We hypothesized that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of children with bacterial coinfections would have a defective respiratory burst and ability to kill bacteria compared to children with no bacterial coinfection.",

Similar modulation of CD66b, CD63, CD16, and CD181 were observed between primary airway neutrophils from patients and donor neutrophils transmigrated into patient ASN compared to blood neutrophils (pre-transmigration) (Fig. 4A\u2013D). Although patient ASN had intrinsic HNE activity, there was no evidence for surface recapture of HNE in transmigrated neutrophils (Fig. 4E). Unlike the in vivo patient data, CD88 (complement receptor 5a) was decreased in neutrophils transmigrated to ASN (Fig. 4F), and HLA-DR was not different in neutrophils transmigrated to ASN (Fig. 4G) compared with blood neutrophils. In vivo, CXCR4 is a surface marker expressed on human neutrophils that plays a role in tissue retention25\u201327. Upon neutrophil transmigration in vitro, CXCR4 was upregulated compared to blood neutrophils (Fig. 4H). Exploration of the Arg1 and PD-L1 axis demonstrated that Arg1 expression was increased on the cell surface of neutrophils transmigrated to ASN (Fig. 4I). Neutrophils transmigrated into pooled Day 1 ASN from all patients had decreased PD-L1 surface expression compared to blood neutrophils (Fig. 4J). However, we did not detect significant differences in Arg1 and PD-L1 expression on blood and airway neutrophils in vivo (data not shown). Experimental controls using negatively selected neutrophils rather than whole blood neutrophils (Fig. E3) and direct incubation of neutrophils with ASN compared with transmigration (Fig. E4) did not show significantly different results compared with those shown in Fig. 4, except for CD16 which decreased in the co-incubated experiment compared to transmigrated neutrophils.",

In contrast, neutrophils transmigrated toward LTB4 or pooled Day 1 ASN from all patients showed an increased respiratory burst intensity to fMLF compared to unstimulated transmigrated neutrophils (Fig. 5B). Coincubation of neutrophils with pooled Day 1 ASN, without transmigration, for the same duration in serum-free media resulted in stimulation of the respiratory burst with no increase in intensity with addition of fMLF. Neutrophils transmigrated toward ASN was bimodal with a diminished fMLF-stimulated respiratory burst compared with neutrophils transmigrated toward LTB4.

In contrast with this conventional paradigm, the findings presented here support the notion that a large population of neutrophils remains viable and undergo profound changes upon recruitment to the airways of these patients. Viable airway neutrophils demonstrated surface mobilization of multiple sets of granules, and lose surface expression of CD16, a key phagocytic receptor. Furthermore, airway neutrophils increased expression of HLA-DR, typically associated with professional antigen-presenting cells, thus reflecting functional changes. To further investigate this process, we adapted an airway inflammation model developed in our group to study diseases of chronic lung inflammation (CF, asthma, COPD) to acute lung inflammatory processes occurring in children with acute respiratory failure due to lower airway infections. This model allowed for transepithelial recruitment and pathological conditioning of neutrophils by cell-free patient airway fluid and recapitulated cardinal features of airway neutrophils collected from these patients in vivo. In addition, we identified an association between active HNE exocytosis and bacterial coinfections within 24 hours of endotracheal intubation in these patients and observed that neutrophils recruited to the cell-free airway fluid of patients coinfected with bacteria become deficient in their respiratory burst capacity and in their ability to kill bacteria.",

            "text": "HNE is a serine protease contained in primary granules, and elevated levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma are associated with severity of lung injury in ARDS34. While extracellular HNE can reflect live neutrophil activation and degranulation, in the tracheal aspirate both necrotic and neutrophils releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) may also contribute to increased extracellular levels of HNE, thus precluding the use of extracellular HNE activity as a stringent marker of live neutrophil degranulation. Elevated levels of MMP-9 in the lung epithelial lining fluid of patients with ARDS has also been associated with increased severity of lung injury34,35. Primary granule exocytosis in airway compared to blood neutrophils is evidenced by the increase in CD63 expression in addition to decreases in CD16 and CD35 expression as the latter proteins contain HNE and MMP cleavage sites and may also be removed by membrane reuptake9,36. While CD62L downregulation is expected, CD16 expression is generally increased upon transmigration due to degranulation of secretory vesicles and tertiary granules37,38; however, CD16 can be downregulated if endocytosed and cleaved by high activity levels of HNE and MMP-916,36. Secondary granule exocytosis in airway neutrophils is evidenced by an increase in CD66b expression compared to blood neutrophils. Whether this abnormal activation response can be leveraged therapeutically remains unclear. Indeed, HNE inhibitors, such as sivelestat, have failed to improve mortality in ARDS patients likely due to competing proteases, release of other damage-associated molecular pattern molecules and alarmins, and the immunomodulatory effects of neutrophils on T-cells in the airways of ARDS patients39. Significant differences in neutrophil activation markers between the blood and airway compartments observed in our patient population is consistent with prior studies5,9,16,22,40. Our results highlight the importance of studying the airway fluid and cells recruited therein, rather than simply inferring airway neutrophil behavior and function based on cells isolated from blood.",

Interestingly, one of the roles assigned to the healthy pulmonary vasculature is to selectively retain primed neutrophils, deprime and release them into the bloodstream42. This depriming mechanism may be dysfunctional in ARDS, resulting in release of primed neutrophils into the systemic vasculature that can damage extra-pulmonary organs42. Migration of healthy donor neutrophils through our small airway epithelial model primes these neutrophils to undergo a respiratory burst; however, migration to ASN with high NE activity had an attenuated respiratory burst upon fMLF stimulation. The decreased respiratory burst in the presence of HNE-rich ASN from bacterially coinfected patients may serve as rapidly assessed biomarker of bacterial coinfection. The mechanism to explain the poor killing of H. influenzae and S. aureus by neutrophils transmigrated to HNE-rich ASN in our model, which is associated with the clinical outcome of a bacterial coinfection, remains to be explored. An increase in relative Arg1 gene transcript levels has been shown in blood neutrophils from ARDS patients relative to healthy volunteers5 consistent with our finding of an upregulation in Arg1 surface expression in neutrophils transmigrated to bacterial coinfected ASN. The influence of other immunoregulatory pathways, such as the PD-L1/PD-1 axis, are under investigation as a possible mechanism to explain bacterial coinfection in some children for viral induced respiratory failure.",

First, we did not perform full functional analyses on primary airway neutrophils due to limited cellular material from patients. Instead, we used cell surface markers of activation as a proxy to inform how well our transepithelial migration model compared to the changes seen in blood and airway neutrophils from patients. In addition, most of our experimental data comes from the transepithelial migration model which recapitulates the small airways \u2013 respiratory generation 8 to 16. The tracheal aspirates from the patients were actually collected from airway generation 1 to 2; however, bronchoalveolar lavage of children is not commonly performed unless needed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes for severe lung injury. Second, we are limited in our ability to collect blood samples from children with a weight under 6 kg or without a central venous or arterial catheter for blood sampling, which made paired comparisons between blood and airway neutrophils from each patient impossible. Nevertheless, despite our limited numbers of patients, we sampled enough patients to identify significant differences in activation and immunomodulatory markers on neutrophils. Although we previously showed differential neutrophil behavior comparing hypertonic saline-induced sputum cells from CF patients and healthy adults9,16,22, we were not able to include controls in this study owing to ethical limitations on obtaining non-clinically indicated airway lavage samples on children intubated for elective surgeries. In addition, children intubated for airway protection, rather than for respiratory failure due to a pulmonary cause, do not have neutrophil-rich airway lavage samples making a direct comparison of cellular material impossible to perform. Instead, we focused on serial blood and airway compartment sampling over time in the PICU to profile how neutrophils change such that each patient may act as their own control in future studies. While children in this study ranged in age from 9 days to 16 years, the majority were under 2 years of age limiting comparisons of neutrophil behavior stratified by age. Finally, patients included in this study were infected with a variety of respiratory viruses and due to limited sample size, we cannot determine the effect of any one virus on airway neutrophil behavior or susceptibility to bacterial coinfection. Despite the infectious heterogeneity of our limited number of samples, we were able to detect a significant neutrophil dysfunction signal in the presence of an activated neutrophil environment.",
