We included also exacerbations with new chest x-ray infiltrates diagnosed as pneumonia. The attending physician made the decision to admit to hospital. During the exacerbation episode, data collected were change of initial antibiotic, complications, invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Length of hospital stay was recorded in hospitalized patients and new exacerbations at 1 year of follow-up. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment was considered when pathogens were not susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic with respect to in vitro susceptibility testing. Patients were followed up for visits in the specialized clinic at 30 days, 90 days and 1 year after discharge.",

Invasive samples were obtained if requested by the attending physician. Microorganism identification was consider positive as in previous publications. [9] Briefly, bacterial identification was achieved by means of the MALDI-TOF MS (Biomerieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique on Muller-Hinton or sheep blood agar, depending on the microorganism growth requirements; E-test and in-house PCR were used to assess unexpected resistance patterns.",
