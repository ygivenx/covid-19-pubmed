Before any new compound may legally be \u201ctested\u201d in a human being, however, regulators generally ask to see extensive preclinical information which includes safety and dose testing on animals.\n4\n Many countries regulate new health technologies thereafter by restricting use of them to clinical trials (to check that they are safe and efficacious) before licensing them for sale on the open market. For example, in the United States the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in the United Kingdom the Medicines and Health Care Products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) require all new drugs, and many new medical devices, to undergo a series of clinical trials before they will consider granting a marketing license. Phase I is commonly a relatively small study, usually involving healthy volunteers, to determine which dose of a new drug is tolerated by the human body. Only when the new drug is known to have severe adverse side effects, as in the case of chemotherapeutic agents, are patients recruited, and even then, only when all other treatment options have been exhausted. Patients are usually recruited at Phase II (when the first tests of efficacy are run) and then again at Phase III (in a much larger cohort to gain statistically more precise estimates of a new drug's efficacy as compared with a control substance that could be a placebo).These rules on preclinical testing may be relaxed for lifesaving treatments under the FDA's policy following the AIDs epidemic (National Academy of Sciences 1990).\n",

For some devices, many tests of a mechanism's function can be run in the laboratory and the effects of such devices in a human can more reliably be predicted than is the case for new drugs. For this reason, some implantable devices may be marketed without undergoing such exhaustive clinical testing. In the circumstances of a public health crisis, where a disease is both communicable and deadly, the use of pharmaceutical treatments is likely to offer the best approach, so I focus on them in the following discussion.",

However efficient this process may be, many people might die before a new treatment could be fully tested, let alone subsequently made available to everyone. Moreover, the general chaos, public panic, decay of infrastructure, and health care worker sickness make it very difficult for us to control conditions sufficiently to allow robust research such as we might need to gather valid results. These research conditions could even be pragmatically incompatible with other measures used to control the spread of the disease.",

The first is under what is sometimes called the doctor's therapeutic privilege, but this legal justification relies on the drug in question having been tested for some other condition and having been licensed for this other particular use on grounds that it is safe and efficacious. The second is under compassionate or \u201cnamed patient\u201d access to a new drug. While interesting, we will see that the philosophical basis for justifying individual access to investigational treatments will not stand up to the circumstances of a public health crisis. The third is through the FDA's expedited or parallel track schemes, although direct or therapeutic access to the investigational treatment is still either delayed for most patients until after Phase II or denied if the patient is eligible for an ongoing conventional clinical trial.",

When faced with a severe threat to public health and many ill patients, much experimentation would probably be done by overworked general practitioners. These doctors might try cocktails of existing and licensed drugs. To count as a plausible treatment at all, there must be some rationale for trying it, with this rationale coming from inferential or analogous reasoning. A physician might infer from his or her theoretical knowledge of biochemistry or physiology that an existing drug might help in these new circumstances. For example, a doctor once tried Viagra on critically ill babies with respiratory problems, knowing that enlarging the blood vessels would increase oxygen supply to the brain (BBC 2007). Or any doctor, faced with a pandemic, might have previously observed beneficial clinical effects on similar symptoms in patients with similar conditions and then seek to apply this knowledge analogously. For example, neurologists and neuroscientists using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat Parkinson's disease noticed not only its effects on inhibiting movement but also its effects on mood (Scicurious 2012). Deep brain stimulation is now being tested for depression and other mental health conditions (Lozano et al. 2012). And indeed, the routine use of Viagra for male impotence was discovered accidentally by observing clinical effects in monkeys while testing it for angina (Terrett et al. 1996).",

Where there is no threat to public health, some individuals are allowed access to experimental treatments on a compassionate and named patient basis, even if their safety and efficacy have not been fully demonstrated, provided that there is some preclinical information to support the rationale for their use (Edwards 2006; National Academy of Sciences 1991). The level of evidence required to provide lawful treatment may thus be lowered in some \u201cexceptional\u201d cases. The use of the word \u201cexceptional\u201d here is contentious even in these cases where a few individual patients who are very ill seek special prior and priority access before a marketing license has been granted for all similar patients. The word \u201cexceptional\u201d could refer to just one patient or it could refer to a single set but comprising several patients. I will continue to use the word for convenience only. In standard cases of an emergency, we thus accept that some individuals should have access to untested treatments on a compassionate basis. In view of the unusual needs of the community in a public health emergency, it might seem that we should simply extend therapeutic access to everyone in that community as they are all in the midst of an emergency. Under such circumstances, any regulatory restrictions on trying new drugs would then be so relaxed that they would disappear.",

This is because the rule of rescue, which we might use to support untested treatments for an individual, collapses as we introduce more, perhaps unidentifiable, individuals. In any case, the rule of rescue is far from being a normative rule and is more often discussed in the context of providing expensive care to an individual against the results of a cost\u2013benefit analysis (Sheehan 2007). The rule of rescue could, at best, be thought to symbolize what a compassionate and humanitarian society might value in extremis under these financially restricted circumstances. Perhaps more usefully in the circumstances currently under consideration, that is, a pandemic, the rule of rescue could be thought to indicate when professional duties to individuals and to groups are clearly differentiated. For example, professional duties in public health and in intensive care are clearly distinguished in this way.\n5\n More often, the rule of rescue reflects our psychological instinct to wade in and help the closest person who is in dire need of our assistance (Sheehan 2007). Interestingly, there is no law requiring us to intervene and rescue, except perhaps in France, mainly due to the inefficiencies such a rule would introduce (Posner 1981). We might find that no one takes on the role of health worker, for example, in order to avoid situations in which such a duty would require such a person to act.I thank Jonathan Wolff for helping me clarify this point in conversation.\n",

            "text": "Following the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and complaints from patients with the disease, for which no treatment then existed, the FDA revised its policy on therapeutic access to investigational treatments (National Academy of Sciences 1991). During the development of zidovudine, for example, the FDA implemented policies to speed up the more restrictive trial phase. Interestingly, these are simply policies with no new regulation as such, since they were supposed to be compatible with existing rules. However, as we have seen, the philosophical justification for therapeutic access at an individual level is different from the philosophical justification for population-level restrictions on access to new medicines, which is principally to benefit patients in the future through gathering evidence. The particular FDA policy change of interest here, expedited development, is to remove the requirement for Phase III evaluation of drugs intended to treat life-threatening and severely debilitating diseases. Earlier trial phases, however, would then have to be designed with controls and probably extended in numbers to compensate for the absence of a separate Phase III. Importantly, therapeutic access would be restricted to research during the early phases. Further, postmarketing surveillance studies might also be required to supplement these data. While this means that patients as a group might have access to treatment sooner, expedited development does not solve the issue from an individual patient's perspective since the patient might still be too ill to wait for routine access after licensing, whenever that might be. Depending on the speed with which a pandemic were to take hold and the sheer number of patients in dire need of some treatment during these early phases of development, there may be many patients in the position of being denied therapeutic access because of these research constraints.",

            "text": "Similarly, the parallel track policy (again, developed by the FDA in response to the AIDS epidemic) makes selected investigational treatments available but only to HIV patients who are deemed ineligible for an ongoing conventional clinical trial. Under this policy, treatment outside research is allowed only once Phase II has been approved, and then only if Phase I provides expanded information (e.g., on different doses) and if patients can still be monitored for adverse effects.\n6\n If eligible for a clinical trial, then a patient cannot simply choose to have the investigational treatment and so such treatment may be delayed. In a pandemic, many patients may die before Phase II is approved and so, again, be denied therapeutic access because of research constraints. In sum, the policies of both expedited and parallel track restrict access to investigational treatments in order to gain scientific knowledge for patients in the future. The philosophical justification for these policies was not made at the time when the new rules were adopted by the FDA, and for a pandemic I suggest they do not go far enough. This provides the motivation for further attention and regulatory work. To think about how regulators should respond to the special conditions of a pandemic, we must review the philosophy behind any restrictive regulation of investigational new drugs.Patients must be unable to participate in related clinical trials either because they do not meet the scientific eligibility criterion, perhaps on account of being too sick, or because their participation would create undue hardship.\n",

It is important to note, though, that the drugs involved were not designed to treat deadly and communicable diseases. Implicit in all subsequent regulation (which restricts access to investigational new drugs to clinical trials to a greater or lesser extent) is the idea that we should use them only with caution, as there is scientific uncertainty about their safety. This philosophy rests on using the \u201cprecautionary principle.\u201d The principle requires a certain level of evidence of safety before members of the public are exposed to threats of \u201cserious or irreversible damage\u201d (United Nations Environment Programme 1992). However, caution does not mean paralysis, as is made clear by the program's principle 15: \u201cLack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\u201d (UNEP 1992, Principle 15). This original description of the precautionary principle in the Rio Declaration has, however, since been changed to \u201cwhen the scientific bases are insufficient or when there is some uncertainty\u201d (EC, 2000, 23 [italics added]). As Holm and Harris (1999) observe, to require proof of safety before any new technology can be introduced does not permit scientific advance at all.",

The account of the precautionary principle that was issued by participants at the 1998 Wingspread conference took this idea further and proposed that the burden of proof should not, however, lie with the regulators, although in theory it could. It should fall on the proponents of the activity to prove that it is safe, rather than on the regulators to prove that it is unsafe. While the precautionary principle instructs us to delay the introduction of potentially risky new practices in order to prevent harm, delay may itself cause harm in the form of lost opportunities to prevent disease and death (Harris and Holm 1999). The precautionary principle necessarily privileges an often indeterminate future risk over, possibly less apparent, current benefits. This difficulty was dramatically illustrated by the death of several thousand people in Peru in 1991 caused by removing chlorine from the municipal water supply after a risk assessment (by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) emphasized the calculated small risk from chlorination products but failed to address the greater risk of untreated water (Anderson 1991). Although the precautionary principle had little weight at that time, and was not explicitly used in the decision, this case is a clear illustration of the risks of its inappropriate application. Furthermore, in addition to downplaying any clear and present risks of not using new technologies, the precautionary principle ignores the possibility that future advances may reduce or eliminate any future risks.",

It is true that the human race has survived pandemics since we started living in close settlements and then towns and cities. We have survived the bubonic plague and deadly strains of influenza. Large genetic subpopulations of the human race, however, did not survive the Black Death (BBC World Service 2001). Our future as a species is in some sense contingent on how we act during a pandemic.

Depending on how health states are valued, new drugs could do more harm than good even when individual patients are desperately ill and expect otherwise to die. I develop this point in the next section to show why some regulation of new medicines is necessary. For example, there are reports of patients with Alzheimer's disease (which is both serious and progressive) being worse off after having received embryonic stem cells (as part of research) than they would have been without any intervention (Freed et al. 2001). However, if we make the cost\u2013benefit trade-off between certain death and the chance of a lingering life of poor health, the precautionary principle (which skews this trade-off against uncertain future harms) should itself be applied with caution. The precautionary principle, in general, serves as a useful check that any commercial interests are not served at the expense of public health, but it does not adjudicate between choices both of which are intended to promote public health. That said, it is worth noting that there are other precautionary measures available to the regulator, besides restricting new medicines to clinical trials, such as close monitoring and meticulous reporting to reduce uncertainty. Before exploring how clinical science could proceed in a pandemic (with due caution), I first establish why some regulation of investigational new drugs remains necessary.",

There are many reasons for this, but to stress that the thesis advanced in this article does not imply a wholly unregulated environment, I discuss the need for regulation based on experimental, current risk. As in the usual researcher\u2013subject relationship, there remains an asymmetry of risk in favor of the researcher, which requires external oversight and supervision (Edwards 2009). These risks are associated with using treatments that produce unknown clinical effects. One reason for regulation of new medicines is that the threat of court action, through common law, is generally not sufficient to counteract fully the vested interests a researcher might have in his or her project, the pursuit of which might expose his or her subjects to greater risks (Edwards 2009).

It may be dangerous to perform humanitarian work without full infection control (as offered in clinics designed for such research work) requiring sterile environments, airlocks, and protective suits and masks.\n7\n If the risk to the researcher is reduced by the use of special equipment, the subject will again be exposed to greater risks than the researcher (whose vested interests might remain without regulatory oversight). The preferential use of protective suits to protect health workers involved in research may raise questions of a political nature, which could, in turn, create social conflict and mistrust in the institution of research. However, if we were to accept arguments in favor of providing health workers with priority access to new therapies (so they are in a position to help treat many others in turn), they may themselves be the \u201csubjects\u201d of new treatments by virtue of being first.\n8\n\nThis was a worry during SARS, but it will be a more severe worry during a severe pandemic flu outbreak: \u201cEven with excellent infection control practices, in the absence of vaccine, attack rates of greater than 10% are likely to occur among health care workers. Viral shedding of influenza occurs 1 to 2 days before symptoms are noted and can continue for 7 days after symptoms begin. Infants and immune-compromised individuals may shed for weeks, which makes transmission of influenza even more difficult to control both in the hospital and the community. In contrast, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus shedding peaks at 7 to 10 days after symptoms begin, making this disease more easily contained with current infection control practices\u201d (Cinti 2005, 63).\nWhile I do not wish to be drawn into a discussion about the ethics of self-experimentation as such, it is perhaps enough to acknowledge that regulation is still important when there are unequal risks to researchers and subjects, whoever they might be.\n",

            "text": "Even given the luxury of a ready infrastructure and potential drug candidates, there seems little room for the full series of conventional clinical trials culminating in a randomized controlled trial. Such trials, while scientifically ideal in other circumstances to reduce selection bias, might be difficult or impossible to run in a pandemic. There are several reasons for this, each of which may be sufficient to make a conventional trial undesirable. First, as discussed earlier, it would take considerable time to complete formal testing even to Phase II, whatever level of statistical significance we were to accept (for speed) and whatever outcomes were measured (for convenience). Second, when no known treatment exists against which to compare a new therapy, any control substance would have to be a placebo. If a standard treatment is available but is known to be ineffective, then it technically counts as a placebo for the sake of therapeutic access to health care.\n9\n However, though the topic is largely outside the scope of this article, it is noted that when effective treatments exist (and have been stockpiled, as in the case of pandemic flu) an active control could be used. In cases of individual emergencies where there is no communicable disease and where there is no alternative active therapy, placebo or ineffective treatment controls are indeed controversial. The problem stems from the possibility of a doctor denying a dying patient the last chance of benefit, which seems too cruel for physicians to countenance even when they are also scientists (Snowdon et al. 1997; Truog 1993; Worrall 2008). When a medically qualified researcher denies a patient a risky treatment that could work when the alternative is certain death, there is legal precedent to suggest that experimental treatment may be ethical and lawful (Edwards 2006). Indeed, the High Court in England ruled in favor of allowing doctors to try an experimental treatment (the drug pensotan polysulfate [PPS] injected directly into the brain) on a patient with variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jacob disease (vCJD; BBC 2002). For a physician to accept randomization, albeit in a blinded fashion, of the allocation of a placebo or a new treatment, the physician-researcher may already be violating duty of care as he or she is not in equipoise, and could simply select the new drug for the patient (or hedge as the HIV patients did in the corrupted AZT trials) to put the individual's interests first (National Academy of Sciences 1991). If, however, an effective standard treatment exists, then a conventional randomized controlled trial using an active control could be ethical, but the circumstances of a pandemic might make it impossible, as I will show. Third, we may not wish to put case and control subjects in close vicinity under the care of the same researcher for fear of further spreading the disease. Fourth, a conventional randomized trial is scientifically important only when the clinically worthwhile effect is moderate but nonetheless significant. In the case of a deadly pandemic, the outcome of interest would have very great significance, that is, many lives saved.Without perhaps any beneficial placebo effect.\n",

We need somehow to combine the practices of research and routine care (which are otherwise thought to be in contrast or even to be mutually exclusive, given standard regulatory restrictions on access). Observational work, or natural experiments in the field, may become more important. A simple anecdote about the successful treatment of one patient might be enough to warrant trying it on another, and so on, until there are enough observational data available to justify more widespread use. As many patients could be dying, without treatment, any reversal of fortune would suggest, if not establish, a dramatic effect and so form a scientific rationale for further investigation. With more lives saved, confidence in the new drug would increase. Once a new drug appears to work and it is available to many patients, then more robust observational data might be collected and pooled.\n10\n The best information in these conditions may be far from the clean aggregate data from a conventional randomized controlled trial and may start as a string of promising anecdotes or a \u201ccase series.\u201dNote that a dramatic effect would not, in any case, require a large randomized controlled trial to become apparent.

At the beginning of a possible outbreak, politicians may not realize the full extent of the problem and may be reluctant to take draconian measures. With novel diseases, all relevant nonpharmaceutical precautions may be taken first until there is sufficient evidence to allow their relaxation. Here, the precautionary principle might refer to social organisation rather than the use of new technologies. For this purpose, health workers and law enforcement agencies need to understand the scale of the problem through social control and basic surveillance. By tracking the incidence of cases, they will learn about the mechanism by which the infection is spread and how quickly it takes hold. The need to stop the spread of a new pathogen might persuade researchers and politicians to restrict freedom of movement. International travel associated with affected regions might be shut down (which is what the WHO recommended during the SARS outbreak in Toronto, Canada, much to the distress of the politicians concerned with maintaining international trade and protecting their economy). In some cases, physical containment is still the only way to manage a public health emergency.

However, the crucial difference is that individuals are recruited from predefined clusters rather than the general patient population.

Overall, it has now been given to more than 31 million people worldwide and, because of the potential seriousness of the H1N1 infection, Pandemrix remains a licensed alternative for children (at the time of writing).

But CRCTs could exacerbate existing health inequalities if they are not subject to genuine random allocation of the new drug. If there is good reason to believe that the group receiving the new treatment first would fare better than the group acting as control, those with political power would have good reason to rig the randomization process to make sure their constituents get the treatment first. This also makes the exacerbation of preexisting inequalities more likely, because the population of more affluent districts might well be more politically active, consequently having more political influence over the allocation process.",

We could, however, argue that we should not require equipoise in randomized cluster trials. The requirement of equipoise is always very demanding, even in the context of conventional RCTs. Scientists must have some reason for thinking that the new treatment is superior to currently accepted treatments; otherwise there would be no rationale for testing and there would be no basis for calculating the necessary sample size.

Estimating the sample size needed to show a significant difference is complicated in cluster designs by an intra-class correlation (measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) (Ukoumunne et al. 1999). This is due to the fact that the individuals belong to the same cluster or group, defined by social or geographical boundaries. They are likely to exhibit a degree of homogeneity, which may influence the measure studied in the trial. Indeed, the between-cluster variation will sometimes be larger than the variation between individuals within a cluster. To achieve the desired statistical power, scientists could increase the total number of clusters (Ukoumunne et al. 1999), or they could choose to test only those treatments for which the anticipated effect is relatively large. By increasing the number of clusters we would inevitably increase the total number of human participants, which, in turn, might have implications for fairness. This would subject a greater number of people to any trial-generated inequality. Increasing the threshold for an intervention effect would increase the size of the generated inequality. In a virulent and deadly pandemic, we would be looking for the largest effect size possible.",

Cluster trials may compound any issues of a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d nature, where different local districts implement different substantive policies (Devlin 2008). They are unlikely to form a new devolved political structure, which results in a postcode lottery of treatment specifically for the disease in a pandemic. This is because the delivery of the new treatment will be determined by preexisting structures that govern the development of strategies of geographical containment. However, a CRCT that was centrally planned (e.g., by the World Health Organization [WHO] as the directing authority for health within the United Nations) would not be able to justify differentially implemented policies in order to protect a greater right to the autonomy of individual districts. One may appeal to autonomy to protect the right of or group leaders to enroll their communities in research, but not to protect the right of scientists to plan a cluster trial centrally. If well-publicized cluster RCTs were seen as socially unacceptable, this could hamper the entire public health effort.",

When asked in several studies to compare different risky technologies, lay people judged the same number of fatalities as more serious when caused by a single accident (harming groups) than when they are dispersed across several events (harming isolated individuals) (Vlek and Stallen 1981; Slovic et al. 1979; Slovic et al. 1980). More recently, Slovic and colleagues showed that clustered risks from a single event are particularly problematic when the probabilities are largely imprecise while exposure to those risks is uncontrollable and potentially catastrophic (Slovic et al. 1984). These clustered risks, however, can be made more acceptable with greater anticipated benefits, especially to those clusters exposed to the risks (Vlek and Stallen 1981). For these reasons, a cluster trial of a promising new treatment may be seen as acceptable on the grounds that the same group exposed to the risk of the treatment also stands to benefit. However, it is more likely that, in a pandemic, the risks of not receiving anything would be seen to be problematic especially when the effects of any inequality would be long-lasting or when they would be impossible to address afterwards (or through the sequential delivery of treatment by cluster). By the time the new treatment has been fully rolled out, many in some acting control (allocated to delayed treatment) clusters may have died. However, the number of deaths is likely to be far fewer than if the treatment were first restricted to research, and only then rolled out to the wider population.",

Those not selected as eligible would lose out. Rather, the allocation of clusters, whatever their social status, could be randomized if the process were genuine, without political perversion, and there were sufficient epistemic uncertainty surrounding its effects. In this way, members of the public may hold sufficient trust in the research to accept it. The degree of public trust could be assessed, hypothetically, in advance; there are already mechanisms for gauging public opinion about medical research generally (National Institutes of Health [NIH] 2005).",

There had been more than 800,000 cases of swine flu across the United Kingdom and 457 deaths, including those of children and pregnant women. The review put the total cost of the pandemic at \u00a31.2 billion, taking into account both the preparation and response stages. The vast proportion of that total, around \u00a31 billion, went to pharmaceuticals, which included the antiviral drug Tamiflu (the vaccine for swine flu) and antibiotics.",

However, while government is funding institutes for translational medicine, the pharmaceutical industries are closing their large research and development facilities after several years with disappointing results. The next big blockbusters, they suggest, will come from smaller, more concentrated, groups. This may give public authorities greater negotiating power when facilities are needed to increase the pace of research in a pandemic. An example of the reduced power of pharmaceutical companies is the action of the Indonesian government, which refused to hand over samples of the H5N1 avian influenza virus to the WHO in 2007 unless its citizens were guaranteed access to any resulting vaccine, thereby creating a global health governance crisis (Fidler 2008). And the Indian courts have recently issued a compulsory license or treatment order that effectively defeats any patent advantage a company might use to charge above what developing countries can afford for treatments (Global Health Check 2012).",

With the emphasis on nonpharmaceutical methods of geographical and social containment and on what observational or natural experiments are compatible with them, wider access to new drugs may not mean losing scientific evidence of safety. For example, cluster trials could provide a way to evaluate new drugs and gather meaningful scientific data while managing the spread of disease and the wider distribution of new drugs. The effects of the new treatments could be evaluated while they are being rolled out to the population. Yet concern for fairness requires any research be planned with ensuing group inequalities and commercial exploitation in mind. Genuine randomization of clusters and robust political systems help to address the inescapable issue of fairness, while those with a duty of care to individual patients are protected by policy. Commercial interests should, to a large extent, be governed by government. While we are free of the panic of a pandemic, it would be wise to think through these questions, consider the views of the public, and prepare policy for such an eventuality.",
