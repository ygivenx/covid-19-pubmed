Ehrlich was the first scientist to stain blood cells. He also identified the inheritance of immunity and propounded the side chain theory of antibody action, receiving the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1908 together with Elie Metchnikoff.1 Ehrlich also discovered Salvarsan (Figure 2), an arsenic compound for the treatment of syphilis and showed that methylene blue could be used for the treatment of malaria. He suggested that a chemical compound could be used as a magic bullet (Zauberkugel) to selectively kill a disease\u2010causing organism, an idea which has been partially realized by the explosive development in recent years of monoclonal antibody therapeutics.2 But for most pharmacologists, the concept of the magic bullet remains an unattainable dream. Much as we should like to be able to hit a target with the accuracy and speed of a chemical bullet, the therapeutic target has an irritating habit of moving around.",

The molecule aimed at with a drug may move location, from organ to organ or be transported within the body so that delivery of the drug is crucially important. The molecule may be present at a higher expression rate in some individuals or as a result of disease. In others it may be absent as a consequence of genetic differences such as single nucleotide polymorphisms so that the tested drug has no effect. As a corollary, the target itself may not move, but the treated organism can modify the drug, for instance by degrading the drug, meaning the \u201cbullet\u201d loses momentum and barely reaches the target. In addition, transport proteins (eg P\u2010glycoprotein) are expressed which carry the drug back outside the targeted cells. With some drugs, the effects observed may be unrelated to the target at which it is aimed, because unbeknown to the medical \u201chunter\u201d, the \u201cshot\u201d has been sliced and a totally unexpected target has been hit, leading to so\u2010called \u201coff\u2010target effects\u201d. All these off\u2010target changes have a marked effect on the precision of the pharmaceutical bullet, since the reproducibility of the treatment is considerably reduced.3, 4 Alternatively, the target molecule can transform, not just in an oncological sense. It may occur in different isoforms or conformations, be changed or differentially expressed in response to cell stimuli or pathophysiological processes and can be modified over time in culture, with the time of day or as a result of aging. These changes in the nature of the target modify the accuracy of the drug treatment,5 so that what appears to be a true assessment of its efficacy in one study or population is no longer true under different conditions.",

This may be due, among other things, to poor experimental design and methods, inadequate sampling, false use of statistics, lack of suitable controls or simply too much haste to get the data published. In this case, the set\u2010up of the target is incorrect and it becomes wobbly or falls over completely. A number of measures to counter this superficial science are being taken by various organizations, including the National Institutes of Health in the United States, the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research and the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, as well as several leading journals.9, 10 It is hoped that this will enhance both robustness and reproducibility.

New neuronal connections and pathways are generated or lost in response to emotional experiences, environmental stress or learning, disease, trauma, or conditioning and this subject has been extensively addressed.12, 13 We do suggest, however, ways in which the drug target can be made to stand still or at least become easier to hit.

It occurs relatively infrequently because of the effective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair mechanisms in most cells and competent immune surveillance, but under environmental and selection pressure, the mutation rate is increased. For immune defense, this can mean that epitope drift occurs, together with loss of antigens for host immune attack. Viruses are probably the champions at mutating16 in order to avoid destruction by vaccines or drugs. With global concern awakened by recent epidemics of influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola and Zika viruses, the need for effective antivirals has become more urgent. The most promising way forward with the most capricious of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), appears to be to hit the virus at different sites with multivalent vaccines.17 This multi\u2010barreled approach has also proved effective in the drug therapy of HIV infection. With a combination of drugs, including non\u2010nucleotide and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and viral entry inhibitors, the introduction of Highly Active Anti\u2010Retroviral Therapy, composed of at least three different drugs, has effectively reduced the mutation rate and enabled many chronically HIV\u2010infected patients to live relatively normal lives.18 Such combination therapy directed at a specific viral target is also under extensive investigation for the therapy of other viral infections, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, for which a four\u2010drug combination was recently marketed.19, 20 However, inclusion of the hepatitis C NS5B protein inhibitor, sovosbuvir, in antiviral drug combinations has dramatically enhanced success rates in the treatment of all genotypes of hepatitis C, indicating the value of aiming specifically at a crucial target.21\n",

In many ways, we are facing a similar situation with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, particularly for nutritional livestock or for viral infections, which is actually promoting bacterial resistance mechanisms, such as drug efflux and methylation.22 Warnings about the global increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the consequent loss of treatment options for many infections are now common and governments and industry have started joint efforts to combat the problem.23, 24 The situation highlights the importance of taking a multi\u2010target approach, but also increasing specificity and developing more effective and rapid diagnostic procedures to identify the potential etiological micro\u2010organism(s).",

Recently, it has been shown, on the basis of an analysis of UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data from 68 496 individuals, that an average of 3% of these individuals carry at least one allele with a mutation at the active site of a GPCR drug target.25 For some GPCRs, the incidence of missense changes is much higher. Thus, over 86% of individuals carry at least one missense mutated allele at the active site of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) and 69% in the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor, respectively. These two GPCRs are targets of the common antiemetic, nabilone, and several antidiabetic drugs such as exenatide, respectively. For these and other classes of drugs, the incidence of mutations suggests that there is an extensive propensity in the population for genetically induced, differential or even absent responses to drugs acting on GPCRs. The authors actually tested experimentally some variants of mu\u2010opioid and cholecystokinin\u2010A receptors and confirmed that different responses to actions at the variant receptors, compared to those on the wild\u2010type receptor, were obtained for a full agonist (morphine), a partial agonist (buprenorphine), an antagonist (naloxone) and the endogenous agonist endomorphine\u20101.25\n",

Plastic changes in tumors have long stymied specific therapeutic targeting strategies. These changes include uncoupling of homeostatic regulation of growth in tumor cells, their resistance to drug therapy, for instance, by overexpressing efflux transporters such as P\u2010glycoprotein, and aggressive invasion of surrounding tissue. Although new approaches, such as kinase inhibition and immune checkpoint therapy are beginning to have an impact, use of cytotoxic drugs remains a mainstay of oncological treatment. 26\n,\n27 Here again, these drugs affect a wide spectrum of cellular growth processes. Adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs, particularly on the gastrointestinal system are pronounced, but more sinister long\u2010term genetic effects can arise. For instance, treatment of mice with the chemotherapeutic agents, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C, or procarbazine caused apparent genome\u2010wide instability with significant elevation of simple tandem repeat mutation frequencies in the sperm and bone marrow of their offspring.28 Thus, intergenerational effects of anticancer therapy may potentially place the children of treated parents at risk, suggesting that a warning of potential effects on offspring should be given to patients of childbearing age to be treated with chemotherapy. As with infectious diseases, the collateral damage caused by nonspecific cytostatic therapy could well be a health threat to future generations and highly specific multi\u2010targeting could well be a better option. In fact, the most recent information\u2010based research suggests that a variety of different tumor types exhibit a recurrent regulatory structure consisting of functional master regulator proteins which are dysregulated in a posttranslational manner.29 Multiple targeting of this network of master regulator proteins, potentially starting also with screens in vitro, may be a way ahead for cancer therapy.",

Many cell biologists are familiar with the fact that cell lines can become unresponsive due to some form of gene silencing when cultured for prolonged periods. But recent discoveries clearly show that cells respond very differently when the pH or oxygen concentration alters, as occurs, for instance during inflammation or ischemia. As a consequence, the effects of tested drugs change (www.ddw-online.com/therapeutics/p315005). In addition, cell stimuli are often grouped together by scientific investigators on the basis that they ultimately result in the generation of the same cell product with a similar outcome. For instance, prostaglandin (PG) E2 production by macrophages has been used for decades as an experimental readout for a response to an \u201cinflammatory stimulus.\u201d30 This is in keeping with the pathological situation, but PGE2 generation following stimulation of macrophages by antigen\u2010antibody complexes, calcium ionophore or phagocytosis occurs under the influence of different signaling pathways and from cells with different phenotypes. Most importantly, PGE2 also exerts anti\u2010inflammatory effects. These include suppression of phagocytosis and triggering of the resolution phase, when acute inflammation subsides. Thus, this lipid inhibits its own production via a negative feedback loop or by inducing generation of proresolving mediators and thereby modulates subsequent adaptive immunity.31, 32, 33 So the type of inflammatory stimulus, the time and inflammatory phase during which cells are collected, as well as the type of response measured can markedly alter the effect of the compound tested (see also section 5. Time, age, and the resolution of disease). The use of a defined stimulus to elicit a particular pharmacological or phenotypic response from a standardized cellular or biological test system would seem to be a solution to many of the issues outlined above. Across a variety of laboratories, responses to pharmacological intervention can then be compared much more easily. The problem is that Nature does not play fair and a disease syndrome can be the result of a whole range of different triggering agents. As far as possible, drug screening, therefore, should be carried out in a milieu that reflects the target disease environment.",

Some researchers consider the cells to be in a continual dynamic state, altering their phenotype according to the conditions of the extracellular milieu.36 Moreover, the polarization of macrophages to a particular phenotype is under tight metabolic regulation, so changes in glucose, pH and other nutrients can change the genetic expression profile of the cells.37 This appears to be related to a \u201crewiring\u201d of the citric acid (Krebs) cycle by inflammatory stimuli, simple products of the cycle such as citrate, succinate, and fumarate exerting remarkable changes in macrophage and dendritic cell function.38 We have also shown recently that the resting polarization state of primary human macrophages and the THP\u20101 macrophage cell line differs, the latter being more polarized to an M1 state, with the relevant modifications in gene expression profile.39 Consequently, different forms of the same cell, in terms of cell lines and primary cells, particularly white blood cells, do not necessarily produce similar responses. To be able to gain a more accurate assessment of the effects of pharmacological agents on this type of cell, it is therefore, crucial to select a variety of cell phenotypes under different physiologically relevant stimuli, with evaluation of gene expression, cell signaling, and surface molecule expression changes, as well as the determination of secreted products. A variety of drugs have been reported to change the phenotype of macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo40, 41 so careful dissection of a spectrum of responses is needed to identify differences in pharmacological mechanisms.",

This can be done quite effectively in zebrafish or insects, because the generational turnover is much more rapid than in mammals.44, 45 Many drugs, particularly the anticancer agents discussed above, modify posttranslational changes. But other types of drugs, including analgesics, are able to modify epigenetic markers such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation.46, 47 Thus, the post\u2010translational silencing or activation of genes may be continued to subsequent generations. In this respect, a warning note is raised by the finding discussed earlier that treatment of male mice with standard chemotherapeutic drugs results in transgenerational instability in their offspring.28 Variability in natural populations is often driven by environmental or infection induced posttranslational genetic modifications and it is highly probable that drug treatment may need to be included among the modifying factors.48\n",

For instance, a widely used experimental model of multiple sclerosis is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This is commonly induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunological challenge with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, an important autoantigen in the CNS, administered in the immunological adjuvant, Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA, killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in paraffin oil), with or without pertussis toxin to make the blood\u2010brain barrier permeable. Animals develop a progressive form of paralysis which can be scored.49 A variety of active compounds and marketed drugs has been developed on the basis of their activity in this model. However, only a minority of multiple sclerosis patients exhibit a chronic progressive form of the disease. The more common relapsing\u2010remitting form, occurring in 85% of patients, can be better reproduced in SJL mice after challenge with myelin proteolipid protein in FCA with pertussis toxin or in Dark\u2010Agouti rats with rat spinal cord homogenate in FCA. We have recently shown that even when assessing established, marketed drugs, not all EAE models show similar responsiveness to already approved treatments.50 However, even in models which show little responsiveness in terms of clinical score assessment, the concurrent use of more clinically relevant variables, such as behavior or social interaction, uncovered unexpected efficacy. Other authors have reported that sensitivity to mechanical pain in EAE also varies between SJL and C57BL/6 mice.51 The lesson drawn is that the genetic and phenotypic variety in experimental models can be taken into account partially using a range of genetically sensitive strains and a selection of translationally relevant assessment methods to generate an efficacy profile that provides a more precise picture of drug efficacy.",

Consequently, the immune system begins to recognize antigenic molecules beyond those of the specific, external chemical determinants to which a specific immune response was initially induced.52 Not only does this lead to autoimmune tissue damage but also to the recruitment of a variety of different humoral, cytotoxic, and immunoregulatory mechanisms. At a later stage of many chronic autoimmune diseases it is, therefore, difficult to determine the basic underlying defect. Genetic and biomarker studies may highlight common factors in the disease, such as HLA\u2010DR4 variants or anti\u2010citrullinated protein antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis, which help to stratify patients for therapy,53 once again emphasizing the need for a range of disease assessments in evaluating effects of drug therapy. But epitope drift can also complicate the use of experimental models of autoimmunity. One of us (MJP) well remembers performing a series of studies years ago on the tissue injuring effects of lymph node lymphocytes from Lewis and Wistar rats with adjuvant\u2010induced arthritis,54, 55 during which the reactivity of the lymphocytes was gradually lost with time, presumably due to epitope drift, and the project had to be stopped. These observations are supported by results of a study by other authors on adjuvant arthritis induced in Sprague Dawley rats from two different vendors.56 The rats from the two sources varied in their susceptibility to arthritis, as well as in immune (various proinflammatory cytokines) and endocrine (plasma ACTH and corticosterone) responses. The authors suggested that different types of genetic drift in the two colonies were probably responsible, a possibility raised in a previous publication.57 It would be well worthwhile to carry out a comparative study between different labs of the range of antigenic reactivity of lymphocytes from animals in which the same initial stimulus is used to induce the autoimmune response. One would guess that this reactivity would differ considerably, indicating that the researchers are not necessarily assessing the same response.",

Moreover, it is now clear that changes in the functions of T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells are closely related to their metabolic states.38, 58 Most laboratory animals are fed standard laboratory diets, so changes in immune responses are generally due to administered immunological stimuli, but this is not necessarily translatable to the clinical situation where dietary conditions vary considerably. Although diet can be controlled during phase 1 clinical trials in human volunteers, such dietary control is much less feasible in later stage trials. Intake of various types of fatty acids, trace elements and fruits rich in vitamins can all affect immune responses. For example, adequate zinc and selenium intake is necessary for the effective functioning of the immune system.59 Among other effects, zinc is important as a cofactor for T\u2010cell signaling, thereby facilitating differentiation and maturation of T lymphocytes, as well as promoting phagocyte and NK cell function.59 It is often used as an adjuvant treatment for infections and is recommended by the WHO for infectious diarrhea in children in developing countries.60, 61 Selenium is crucial for the function of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes and other endogenous selenoproteins, such as thioredoxin reductases. Deficiency of selenium is associated with neutrophil and lymphocyte defects, probably due to inadequate protection of membranes from oxidative injury.62 Vitamin E also exerts a similar protective action on membrane integrity.59 These findings have provided considerable stimulus to the use of dietary supplements to strengthen the immune response. There is also increasing evidence that probiotics such as Lactobacillus can not only modify the constitution of the gut microbiome but also promote innate immunity. In this way, they also indirectly enhance adaptive immunity.63, 64, 65 Even in laboratory animals, though, dietary changes can occur unexpectedly. In one study in which one of us (MJP) was involved, eicosanoid metabolites, including PGE2, were determined over a period of several years in platelets and inflammatory exudates from different experiments on laboratory rats fed an essential fatty acid deficient diet. With time, the quantities of eicosanoids generated enigmatically increased.66 The source was eventually found to be an unannounced change made by the diet manufacturer in the source of the oil used to ensure essential fatty acid deficiency.",

SFB promote mucosal IgA production and the formation of Th17 effector cells in the gut Peyer's patches.

Most of us are aware of the physical challenges of intercontinental air travel: jetlag, sleeplessness and lack of concentration and difficulty in adjusting to seasonal and daylight alterations. The reason is that our whole organism, including individual cells, is regulated by body clocks and autoregulatory products of cellular clock genes which regulate transcription factors and control our daily circadian and seasonal rhythms.73 Jetlag results predominantly from light\u2010induced modification in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master body clock, which governs subsequent changes in the periphery. These include alterations in the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland which govern the sleep/wake cycle.74 Light is, thus, widely viewed as a \u201ctime giver\u201d or in German, Zeitgeber.

This initially reduces the space within which the antelope can move and then one of the attackers may be able to injure and slow down the prey before the others come in for the kill. The same approach is used in military actions, to slow down or damage a superior opponent and thereby, it becomes easier to destroy. To use the metaphor we started with in the introduction, the sometimes crazy movement of cars at a major road intersection is best controlled by forcing the cars into specific lanes and introducing co\u2010ordinated traffic lights. The potential for traffic jams is markedly reduced.",

A comparable concept has been proposed in relation to drug doses used for the treatment of disease.135, 136 The authors, for instance, suggested that a combination of low doses of anti\u2010inflammatory analgesic drugs acting at different stages in the generation and action of PGE2 [on release of substrate by phospholipase A2, metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclo\u2010oxygenase and microsomal PGE synthase and finally action of PGE2 on its different receptors] could be used. In this way, the adverse gastric and cardiovascular effects arising from pronounced inhibition of cyclo\u2010oxygenase with NSAIDs could be markedly reduced. Alternatively, an immune reaction or neurological deficiency could potentially be regulated by light or melatonin to make the final target more accessible to treatment. The growth of a dysregulated cancer or other cell could be slowed so that more time is available to target a more specific mechanism. In this way, the serial use of two to three pharmacological agents, preferably with long drug\u2010target residence times, would probably have greater efficacy than a single potent agent that only proves to be effective in a limited number of patients because of the inherent instability of the target mechanism. This approach is already taken to good effect in the treatment of hypertension in which a diuretic, for instance, is combined with a sartan and/or a calcium antagonist to consistently decrease blood pressure.137\n",

Docking to the \u03bc\u2010opioid\u2010receptor led to the identification of a compound which preferentially activated signaling through the G protein Gi, with clear analgesic activity, avoiding signaling through the \u03b2\u2010arrestin pathway, associated with the side\u2010effects of respiratory depression, constipation, and tolerance.138 In view of the much increased understanding of signaling pathways, this might be a promising approach.",

In this context, a set of guidelines has been proposed to facilitate in vitro test selection for kinase inhibitors\u2014which have a variety of off\u2010target effects\u2014in order to define potentially therapeutically beneficial off\u2010target pharmacological effects.140 Stratification of animal and clinical systems, based on biomarkers or genetic clustering, as well as age, sex, and disease stage, even diet, with consideration of circadian and circannual rhythms, should also improve specificity. To gain a hold on some of these less easily controllable variables, it is essential to make effective use of reference compounds. This involves checking whether their responses remain the same under all conditions and whether the pharmacological response from the test situation is as expected.

We have already seen how in the elderly this can cause problems. It is preferable if individual drugs can be developed with multiple relevant actions. Recent studies suggest that single small molecule compounds may be developed to hit several targets simultaneously. Thus, glitazone compounds have been described recently for metabolic disorders with partial PPAR\u03b3 agonist, potent COX\u20102 antagonist (nanomolar IC50 values) and moderate 15\u2010LOX inhibitor (micromolar IC50 values) activities. These compounds were anti\u2010inflammatory on macrophages in vitro and in acute inflammation in vivo.141 Whether this activity requires all mechanisms of action or can be attributed to just one or two of them, remains to be established. Other approaches to multi\u2010targeting include network targeting, as with optogenetics in which neuronal circuits are modulated by marking of specific genes with rhodopsin which responds to light,142 or with phenotypic assays which use functional readouts as opposed to single target\u2010based assays. Considerable interest has arisen in the use of phenotype assays, both in primary cellular or stem cell systems in vitro and in animal models of disease.143, 144 For instance, it was reported that NSI\u2010189, a benzylpiperizine\u2010aminiopyridine that stimulates general neurogenesis of human hippocampus\u2010derived neural stem cells in vitro, is able to exert multidomain effects on cognition and depression, suggesting that phenotypic multitargeting may also be viable for CNS disorders.145 The challenge is to identify, possibly by reverse pharmacology through extrapolation backwards from the clinical condition, a phenotype or set of symptoms to use as potential functional targets for initial screening. Subsequently, when an active hit or lead compound is identified, target deconvolution has to be carried out to investigate potential mechanism(s) of action. Recently, proposals have been made for establishing a \u201cchain of translatability,\u201d starting with the identification of a disease\u2010associated molecular characteristic or signature such as a disease\u2010associated gene expression profile.146 This is then succeeded by cellular models which aim to reconstruct a cellular phenotype as similar as possible to that of the disease condition and subsequently, use of relevant animal models of disease.",

Together they act synergistically to inhibit the bacterial synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid. A further example of this approach is the sequential combination of drugs acting at different stages of cell signal pathways. Several growth factors act through the phosphoinositol\u20103\u2010kinase/protein kinase B pathway which is crucial for cell proliferation and angiogenesis. A downstream effector of this pathway is the regulatory protein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Addition of the anticancer drug, docetaxol to adenocarcinoma cells in vitro for 24 hours, followed by the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus was highly synergistic in suppressing phosphorylation of mTOR as well as in suppressing proliferation in lung cancer cell lines.150 The authors proposed that this sequential combination may be effective in overcoming resistance of tumors to mTOR inhibitors. Using a similar rationale, a phase 2 study was carried out in which the tubulin polymerization inhibitor, BNC105P was administered together with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.151 While the primary endpoint was not reached, analysis of biomarkers suggested that further studies are warranted.",

A wide variety of different pharmacological, physical, nutritional, and other procedures are used in the hospital setting to treat the ill patient. However, a therapeutic program synchronized for the various factors we have discussed is rare. Considerable potential appears to exist in modifying the gut microbiota to improve drug efficacy, as discussed previously in relation to drug metabolism. Thus, by modulating the gut bacterial population there is increasing evidence that the efficacy of current anticancer chemotherapeutics can be enhanced and their toxicity reduced,152 perhaps by simple measures such as regular use of probiotics. Obviously, in the treatment of all human diseases, drug therapy is usually just one of the measures taken to improve the health of the patient. But the optimal conditions for implementing supportive measures are not often assessed, certainly not in preclinical investigations. For instance, the efficacy of the appetite suppressant, diethylpropion, used clinically to cause short\u2010term weight loss, was greater when given to rats at night when their activity was greatest and when the animals were also placed on high fat dietary restriction.153 In many chronic diseases, muscle loss occurs and general metabolic deficiencies arise. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for instance, there is increasing evidence that combined nutritional and exercise interventions can be effectively used in combination with drug therapy.154 In contrast, in the treatment of cancer, caloric restriction, as with ketogenic diets, has been found to both enhance drug efficacy and reduce toxicity.155 Measurements taken during such synchronized treatment studies should be made at set times and seasons, allowing for the fact that the duration of action of some drugs is long. Such synchronization of drug therapy with other factors will undoubtedly become possible in the near future, as the combined use of the 4Ds, drugs, diagnostics, devices and (big) data, becomes increasingly possible.156 In any case, even with established drugs, it is crucial to be vigilant and to be aware of new findings that can impact the way in which drugs are prescribed and used.",
