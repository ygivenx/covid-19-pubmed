Commercially-available W-LEDs are fabricated by combining either a blue-emitting InGaN-based LED chip covered by a yellow-emitting phosphor Y3Al5O12:Ce3+ (YAG)2\u20135 or n-UV LED chip with coupling red, green and blue tricolor phosphors6\u20139. A large number of luminescent materials used for LED applications are based on rare-earth ions doping technology1, 10\u201312. Given a history of ecological concerns about pollution from rare earth mines, particularly in China, there are growing social and environmental concerns about the growth of the mining and mineral processing in this sector13\u201315. Apart from rare-earth ions doping, nature of narrow absorption for YAG limit its application for n-UV LED application. Advent of technological advancement and economic growth have put our environment at great risk which has led researchers and scientists to develop technology that generates less negative environmental impact. We need to find some substitute for reducing the usage of rare-earth ions, preferably.",

Phellodendron bark mainly composed of berberine and palmatine18\u201320, which have been vastly used in Chinese traditional medicine21\u201325 for various symptomatic treatment and pharmacological activities, such as inflammation26, 27, anti-diarrhoea19, 25, antitumor28\u201331, antiviral18, 32, 33, and pneumonia34. Aside from its importance in traditional and modern pharmaceuticals, Phellodendron bark has been one of the major sources of yellow dye in Asia for fibers and paper materials not only for its color but also for its insect repellency35\u201339. Berberine and palmatine have received much attention in the field of medicine, dyes and dyeing since it is one of the few cationic colorants of the natural plant dyes, and it has high alkaloids40, 41. Furthermore, Zhang et al. found the yellow varnish on the metallic foil of a 19\u201320th century Tibetan altar, the presence of berberine and possible palmatine as well, by using HPLC-MS analysis42. Its major chromophoric substance is known to be berberine and palmatine which dyes fibers into yellow color from Phellodendron bark. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study on both the luminescence properties and LED applications of yellow material from Phellodendron bark. In this study, we firstly demonstrate that Phellodendron phosphor by extracting natural Phellodendron bark with ether and composition and luminescence of Phellodendron phosphor were investigated. In addition, in order to reduce usage of rare-earth ions, we combine commercial phosphor and natural Phellodendron phosphor by extracting.",

Since the alkaloids in Phellodendron chinense Schneid were high polar, methanol-d4 was used as a solvent to ensure that all the extract can be dissolved and avoid the inference of phenolic hydroxyl signals for NMR measurement18. The 1H NMR spectrum of Phellodendron phosphor is well documented in methanol-d4 in Fig. S2 and Table S1.

The emission spectra of Phellodendron phosphor and YAG:Ce excited at 460 nm display the broad yellow-emitting peak at 543 nm and 560 nm, respectively. YAG:Ce, however, could only be excited at 460 nm according to the sharp absorption band at ~460 nm. Even though, the luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphor is 3% of that of YAG:Ce phosphor at 460 nm excitation. Nevertheless, when Phellodendron phosphors were excited at 380 nm, the luminous intensity of Phellodendron phosphor is more than 139% than that of YAG:Ce phosphor. Phellodendron phosphor can be applied both nUV and blue chip for LED devices following to the above result. Fig. S3a shows PL/PLE spectra of commercial red-emission phosphor-CaAlSiN3:Eu2+.

The images of samples are excited under 365 nm in UV box. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the promising application of Phellodendron phosphor in solid-state lighting. We package LED by combing Phellodendron phosphor and commercial YAG:Ce phosphor. Due to the high CCT (over>5000 K) of commercial W-LED (blue LED + YAG:Ce), it produces a cold bluish white. Owing to the continuous advances in phosphor technologies, tunable CCT from 2700\u20136500 K can be achieved48. W-LEDs are constructed by combing Phellodendron phosphor and the commercial YAG:Ce phosphor with an InGaN-based blue LED chip in Fig. 3d. The commercial W-LED (Blue LED + YAG:Ce, namely LED(1)) was compared with the commercial W-LED (Blue LED, YAG:Ce, and Phellodendron phosphor, LED(2)) and the commercial W-LED (Blue LED, YAG:Ce, and CaAlSiN3:Eu2+, LED(3)). As a result, CIE coordinates of W-LEDs are changed from high CCT to low CCT after adding Phellodendron phosphor or CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor in W-LEDs. Photographs of the W-LED lamp packages under 30 mA forward bias currents are shown in Fig. 3b. After adding Phellodendron phosphor or CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ phosphor into phosphor paste, the color temperature of W-LEDs changed from cold color temperature to warm color temperature.
