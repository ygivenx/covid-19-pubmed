HSV-1 pneumonitis is comparatively well investigated in critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation, where ~90% show an oropharyngeal reactivation of the virus within the first 10 days [5]. In a number of retro- and prospective studies in this setting presence of cytology-proven HSV-1 pneumonitis was shown to have a poorer outcome, but antiviral treatment was not beneficial [6-9]. Immunosuppressed patients with malignancies, organ transplants, and cytotoxic treatments for various reasons are the other large, though extremely heterogeneous, group of patients that have been described to develop HSV-1 pneumonitis. Data on the disease in these subjects is more scarce and mainly consists of anecdotal accounts [10-16]. Only one retrospective study of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) microbiology/virology results from renal transplant patients is available and, very recently, a retrospective study on HSV-1 pneumonitis in patients with solid tumors was published representing the first systematic approaches in the field [17,18]. In view of lack of data, it was the goal of the present study to investigate the potential significance of HSV-1 pneumonitis in patients under a maintenance regimen of ambulatory immunosuppression. We therefore retrospectively analyzed admissions for pneumonia/pneumonitis in a comparatively large cohort of outpatients with rheumatoid, vasculitic and connective tissue autoimmune disease over a period of 8 years.",

They are at increased risk for developing opportunistic infections among which respiratory tract involvement is associated with potentially adverse outcomes. Clinical workup of respiratory deterioration in this setting is complicated by the fact that not only bacterial, fungal or viral infectious agents but also a pulmonary flare of the systemic disease or drug-related pulmonary toxicity must be taken into the differential diagnosis. Indicators that raise suspicion for HSV-1 pneumonitis in immunocompromised patients are severe respiratory insufficiency combined with pathologic findings on imaging studies. Thoracic radiographs show segmental bilateral opacities (~95%) and pleural effusions (~50%) while CT may show ground-glass opacities (~100%), focal consolidations (~75%), and pleural effusions (~88%) [22,23]. Especially ground-glass opacities are a useful diagnostic hint in the immunocompromised, suggesting either an opportunistic infection due to Pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV, HSV-1, or other viruses [24]. Other non-infectious differential diagnoses of ground glass opacities have been reviewed by [24].",

            "text": "HSV-1 pneumonitis is a diagnosis of exclusion relying on clinical plausibility, positive viral testing, and imaging studies. The definition of clinically relevant positive viral testing is a matter of controversy. A recent study in patients under prolonged mechanical ventilation by Luyt et al. required the combination of (i) clinical deterioration, (ii) HSV-1 detection in the lower respiratory tract by either PCR or culture, and (iii) cytological or histological evidence of inclusion bodies from either BAL fluids or biopsies to specifically define HSV-1 pneumonitis [9]. While viral cultures are difficult to handle, PCR of BAL fluids has become the most popular diagnostic tool since it is easily performed and sports a high sensitivity. Specificity however, may be lacking due to potential contamination with fluids from oropharyngeal reactivation, which may even occur in plain bacterial pneumonia [5,9,19,25]. Indeed, in Luyt's study, only 43% of those with a positive PCR result also had cytological/histological evidence of infection. Conversely, these cytological/histological criteria lack sensitivity as illustrated by the fact that even open lung biopsies may be negative in the case of autopsy-proven HSV-1 pneumonitis [4]. From a theoretical point of view, HSV-1 viraemia could be an additional specific diagnostic tool, which is, again, associated with a marked reduction in sensitivity [9].",

This is also illustrated by the 60% of cases of pneumonia in our study in which no offending agent was detected despite clinical evidence of infection. Hence, the possibility of falsely negative bacterial testing also applies as a caveat to our Cases 1 and 2. Our centre performed viral testing of BAL fluids for influenza routinely during winter. Concerning other viruses such as adenovirus and coronavirus each centre should define a standard in order to avoid omission or over-testing.",

Leflunomide exhibits antiviral effects against HSV-1 by inhibiting the assembly of viral capsids but not DNA-replication at dosages used in rheumatic patients [26]. It is tempting to speculate, that leflunomide might have led to the shedding of ill-assembled virions in Case 1.",
