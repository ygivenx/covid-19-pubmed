AAVs are a group of small single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses without envelopes that belong to the parvovirus family. The entire genome of AAV is approximately 4.7 kb and contains two major ORFs that encode for Rep and Cap proteins. Under normal circumstances, the AAV virus can coexist within the mammalian host for an extended period without apparent pathogenicity. However, productive infection only occurs in the presence of a helper virus, either adenovirus or herpesvirus1\u20137. Due to this, AAV has become an important gene therapy vector for its non-pathogenic and conditional infectious life cycle8.",

To date, thirteen AAV serotypes (designated AAV1-AAV13) and more than 100 unique variants have been isolated and identified from primate and non-primate hosts9\u201325. Hosts can be as diverse as Chiropteras, Porcine, Serpentes, Bovines, Caprines and Chickens. Among these natural hosts, bats are more geographically dispersed. In addition, Bats host a greater number of emerging viruses per species compared to any other mammalian clade26,27. Bats have been increasingly recognized as a natural host for AAVs in recent years, in addition to the many other important zoonotic viruses, such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola virus28\u201331. With the development of molecular and sequencing technologies, numerous novel AAVs are being discovered. These include BtAAV-YNM14, Rp-BtAAV1 and Rs-BtAAV132. Yan Li identified several adenoviruses and AAVs in a wide host range of bat species with remarkable genetic diversity14. Lau SKP investigated the presence of parvoviruses among different bat species in Hong Kong and mainland China32. Their work broadened the current knowledge of AAV diversity in Bats. Several studies also have investigated the origins of viral diversity in bats or the maintenance of bat-associated viruses in nature. In addition, considerable emphasis has been placed on understanding the direct epidemiological interface from bats to humans33\u201335.",

A 1100 bp fragment encompassing the rep and cap regions of known AAV genome was successfully amplified from 77 out of 415 bat samples (18.6%). The prevalence rate ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% and was detected from four insectivorous bat species. AAVs in the study were detected at nearly all sampling locations except in the SS and LJ regions. Among all four bat species, the virus detection rate for Rhinolophus pusillus was the highest (4 locations out of 6), followed by Myotis davidii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Scotophilus kuhli.

The average prevalence rate is as high as 18.6%, which suggests that AAVs are considerably prevalent among various bat species. However, the absence of Myotis formosus AAV in this study may be due to the limited sampling size. Partial rep and cap ORF sequences analysis of the detectable bat AAVs revealed a relatively large genetic diversity among the bat samples. This suggests that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations as previous studies have reported14,32. However, further extensive work has to be performed to discover new AAV strains and their native bat species around the southeastern coastal regions of China.",

It was phylogenetically closer to mammalian AAVs compared to avian, waterfowl or snake AAVs. BtAAV-CXC1 shared a large branch with the previously reported Rp-BtAAV1, BtAAV1-YNM, and other known human or non-human primates AAVs. This included Adeno-associated virus A, Adeno-associated virus B, and all proven human AAVs (Fig. 3). Amino acid sequence analysis of the rep gene of this novel BtAAV-CXC1 showed 64.8% similarity with human AAV2. Similar results were obtained in a previous study32. In addition, several previous studies have indicated that mammalian and non-mammalian AAVs had a separate evolutionary path, except for a few avian, waterfowl and reptilian AAVs that were distantly related to mammalian AAVs. Bats are thought to be the original host for alpha coronaviruses and beta coronaviruses, while birds for gamma coronaviruses and delta coronaviruses32,37,38. The discovery of additional AAVs from bats and other mammals will contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary origin and pathways of mammalian AAVs. Our study found that the co-occurrence of bat adenovirus and AAV in bat samples was as high as 33.7%, which was similar to the findings in Li et.al.\u2019s study14. This may be because other viruses such as herpesvirus and vaccinia virus are essential for the replication of AAV39.",

To date, substantial efforts have been dedicated on engineering strategies to develope novel AAV capsid variants with increased tropism for precise cell types with lower seroreactivity, and increased manufacturability. Our results revealed that the deduced Cap protein of BtAAV-CXC1 shared an average of 27.7% (ranging from 10.7 to 35.5%) pairwise amino acid identity with other mammalian AAVs.
