MERS-COV can create acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and have a higher chance of patient\u2019s death from multi-organ failure, stubborn hypoxaemia and septic stun [6]. According to recent research, people with comorbidities including chronic lung disease, heart and kidney disease, cancer and diabetes are more likely to become infected with MERS, people with a weakened immunity system are also at higher danger of infection [3, 7]. Various mammalian and avian hosts can be infected with coronaviruses causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic or neurological diseases [8], and animals exposure with MERS-COV include camels, marmosets and macaques [9].",

            "text": "MERS-COV is caused by a novel single stranded, positive (+) sense RNA beta-coronavirus, which is a pathogen of zoonotic reservoir [9, 10]. The precise method of MERS-COV transmission is unrevealed, though dromedary camels [5, 9], and insectivorous bats are considered to be transmission hosts according to the current evidences [2, 3]. Among all RNA viruses, positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronaviruses possess the largest genome (28\u201332 kb) [9]. MERS-COV invades into host cells by attaching to specific di-peptidyl peptide receptors. On the host cell surface, the viral envelope-anchored spike (S) protein binds to its receptor leading to COV entrance into the host cells, and S protein\u2019s protease cleavage is necessary for virus cell unification and the entrance of genomic RNA into the cytoplasm [3, 9]. The S protein (Fig. 1) includes the receptor binding S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The host receptor specifically recognises by S1-subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) and this RDB/receptor connection is the most crucial determinant of COV-host range. Virus infection raises the quantity of replication mistakes in the host genome [8]. Transcription and replication of viral RNA takes place on two fold layer vesicles and different membranous structures obtained from endoplasmic-reticulum [9, 11]. Sub-genomic negative (\u2212) strand RNA intermediates are responsible for transcription of seven sub-genomic mRNA species [9, 11]. At the 5\u2032 end of the genome, a common leader is encoded and attached to the 3\u2032-terminus of sub-genomic RNA, and viral RNA is carried to the endoplasmic-reticulum Golgi -intermediate-compartment (ERGIC), which is the position of assembly and encapsulation of the N protein. Viral RNA is then transferred into vesicles-lined S, E and M proteins. Before secretion, vesicles are moved to the cell-surface. By infecting the same host cell, different COV particles can also recombine their genomes, resulting in rapid evolution. Thus, COVs can readily modify to various hosts, and frequently cross the species hindrances to expand host diversity [3, 9, 11].",

Inhibition of MERS-COV by type-I interferons (IFN\u03b1 and especially IFN\u03b2) has been proposed based on experiments on cultured cells; lung injury can be reduced by a combination of ribavirin and IFN\u03b12b, and within 8 h of virus immunization the lung titre is decreased in rhesus macaques [9, 12]. Developing an effective treatment for MERS is therefore a research priority. To this end, immuno-informatics can be applied for deep analysis of viral antigens, forecast of conformational (discontinuous) and linear epitopes, evaluation of immunogenicity, and virulence of pathogens. Furthermore, an immuno-informatics approach may save time and cost when designing novel vaccines against viruses, and the use of kits and related antibodies can be reduced [13, 14]. Therefore, using this approach, the main aim of the current study was to identify potential B- and T-cell epitope(s) based on envelope and nucleocapsid proteins that could be used to develop promising vaccines [15]. Extreme respiratory infection may also be recovered by T-cell and antibody reactions [12]. In addition, fast recognition and isolation, disease prevention, and control steps are crucial for preventing the MERS-COV transmission in households, communities, and healthcare offices [16, 17]. The main aim of the current study was to identify the potential B-cell and T-cell epitope(s) from the envelope S protein that could be used as promising vaccines agents against MERS-COV.",

Only those epitopes were chosen that were visible on outer surface and other intracellular epitopes were eliminated. Vaxijen 2.0 server was utilized for antigenicity study of chosen epitopes [23]. Recognition of B-cell epitopes was depended on; antigenicity, accessibility of surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity and predictions of linear epitope [27]. Hydrophilicity, isolation of linear epitope, accessibility of surface and Flexibility analysis were performed through Bepipred linear epitope prediction and Parker hydrophilicity prediction algorithms, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity scale, Emini surface accessibility prediction tool and Karplus and Schulz flexibility prediction tool [28]. Forecast of beta turns in polyprotein was done by utilizing Chou and Fasman beta-turn prediction algorithm [29]. As the discontinuous epitopes are increasingly explicit and have higher dominant attributes over linear epitopes [30, 31], so, the forecast of discontinuous epitopes have additionally been carried out via DiscoTope server [32]. Parameter was set at \u2265 0.5 which indicated 90% specificity and 23% sensitivity. This method relies on surface accessibility and amino acid statistics in a collected form dataset of discontinuous epitopes found out by X-ray crystallography of antigen/antibody protein buildings.

Through Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) tool, the peptide models (antigenic determinants) were docked against their respective HLA-B7 allele to analyse their inhibitory potential. Procedure for molecular docking using MOE has already been described in various studies [13, 43, 44]. Docking procedure utilized in those studies include protonation, expulsion of already bound peptide and energy reduction followed by expulsion of water particles. Triangular matcher algorithm was applied as default peptide placement methods dependent on the receptor shape which without energy optimization rapidly produces 1000 best poses of docked peptide [13]. By applying London-dG scoring function, the energy approximation of the imitated poses was rescored. For every peptide, top ten positioned poses of London-dG were additionally reduced by Force field refinement algorithm. Protein peptide connection were than examined via LigX tool of MOE.

Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity measurement tools analysed the S protein for prediction of B-cell epitopes by assessing the physiochemical properties of the amino acid and their abundance in already known B-cell epitopes. Higher antigenicity score has proposed that it can play a vital role in starting of immune response. The threshold value of tool was adjusted at 1.045 and window size was kept 7. It estimated the antigenic tendency value of protein 1.045 (average), 0.872 (minimum) and 1.258 (maximum). Result of kolaskar and Tongaonkar analysis are shown in Fig. 2a. Hydrophilic region of protein is generally uncovered on the surface and play a significant part in eliciting the immune response. BCPRED-score and calculated antigenicity outcomes of vaxijen surely manifest that all predicted peptides are part of extracellular area of transmembrane-protein and capable to maximize a defence response inside the host during MERS-COV infection. Therefore, to find the surface availability of possible B-cell epitopes and hydrophilicity, parker-hydrophilicity with threshold value 1.279 and Emini surface accessibility prediction tools with threshold value 1.000 were utilized. The visual representation of outcome of both tools is shown in Fig. 2b, c respectively. Values calculated by both these tools were 1.279 (average), \u2212 8.486 (minimum), 6.543 (maximum); and 1.000 (average), 0.033 (minimum), 7.392 (maximum), respectively. Emini surface accessibility analysing tool\u2019s outcomes are given in additional file 2: table S3. Chou and Fasman beta turn analysing algorithm was utilized to predict beta-turn in S protein because beta turn is exposed on the surface and hydrophilic in nature and play a vital role in starting the defence response. Tool\u2019s threshold was adjusted at 1.009, it computed the values which are 1.009 (average), 0.581 (minimum), and 1.414 (maximum). Chou and fasman\u2019s result\u2019s graphical representation is shown in Fig. 2d. The result indicates that region from 213 to 220 amino acid and from 641 to 650 are more disposed to persuade Bturns in peptide structure. It is described by an experimental information that the parts of epitope which connect with antibodies or alleles are mainly elastic in nature. Karplus and schulz flexibility analysing tool represented that the area from amino acid from 854 to 860 sequence positions are highly versatile as shown in Fig. 2e.

So, rigid/focused docking was performed by utilizing same active pocket to dock our peptide library. 10 confirmations for every epitope were produced and top positioned conformations dependent on their dock scores and interactions with HLA-B7 residues were chosen (Table 6). Afterward, interaction examination by ligX tool of MOE was done (additional file 1: figure S5) which displayed that the peptide \u2018AGYKVLPPL\u2019 with highest dock score (-20.9793 kcal/mol) is connecting with key catalytic residues. Human HLA-B7 is a hetero-dimer structure, from the interaction analysis it was showed that Asp-114, Gln-115, Lys-146, Glu-152 and Arg-156 from A chains were making stable hydrogen bonds with the previously mentioned peptide (Fig. 6a). Peptide \u2018WPRPIDVSK\u2019 was docked (dock score -20.4007 kcal/mol) inside the catalytic pocket of receptor protein through 4 hydrogen bonds with Arg-62, Glu-152, Glu-163 and Trp-167 (Fig. 6b). Peptide \u2018ESAALSAQL\u2019 has -19.9914 kcal/mol of dock score with 5 stable hydrogen bonds between peptide and Arg-62, Asn-63, Gln-70, Glu-152 and Gln-155 (Fig. 6c). Similarly, other peptides also show strong and stable bonding with human HLA-B7 residues and shown in Table 6 and Fig. 6d\u2013f.",

The specificity of epitope-based vaccines can be enhanced by only selecting the antigenic parts of proteins exposed on the surface, since these elicit strong immune responses [48, 49]. The viral S protein is considered a primary target for neutralising antibodies, and the S1 subunit of the S protein has been the focus of immunisation strategies to overcome MERS-COV disease [50]. The MERS-COV S protein is an immunogenic protein that plays an important role in the attachment and entry of viral particles in host cells, characterised by high antigenicity and surface exposure [51].",

B-cell conserved epitopes (\u2265 14 residues long) were predicted by IEDB analysis-resource and BCPRED. Other tools in IEDB were utilised to analyse antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility and disulphide bonds. The \u2018QLQMGFGITVQYGT\u2019 yielded a higher immunogenicity score (1.5236) and may represent a potential B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. In addition, several T-cell antigenic determinants possessing the ability to bind MHCI and/or MHCII were predicted using Propred-I and Propred, respectively. MHC-I (YKLQPLTFL) and MHC-II (YCILEPRSG) epitopes interact with numerous HLA alleles and are highly antigenic in nature [52]. In addition, the positions of all predicted epitopes on the 3D structure were confirmed using Pepsurf. Discotope servers were used to predict discontinuous epitopes. Among MERS-COV strains, conservation of predicted epitopes from different countries was analysed to select epitopes common to all. The immune-informatics approach can identify highly conserved epitopes that may deliver wide protection against different strains. Conservation assessment revealed that all predicted epitopes were conserved between MERS-COV gene sequences reported from eight countries. Furthermore, allergenicity, toxicity, mutation and physiochemical properties of predicted antigen determinants were analysed to further increase specificity and selectivity. Digestion analysis confirmed that peptides identified in this study were stable and safe to use. On the basis of immunogenicity score and sequence conservation, it is clear that the conserved peptides are likely to be immunogenic. In addition, 3D structures of all six MHC class I binding peptides were predicted via PEPFOLD and docked with the human HLA-B7 allele by MOE to analyse binding specificity and defence response. Based on docking score, binding potential to HLA-B7, and immunogenicity score, peptides identified in the current study may prove highly immunogenic compared with previously reported peptides [51, 53, 54]. The predicted epitopes should be tested for therapeutic potency in future studies. We predict that the putative epitopes may have therapeutic potential with excellent scope. Our immune-informatics analysis identified potential strong T- and B-cell epitopes that may assist the development of potent peptide-based vaccines to address the imminent MERS-COV challenge.",

This approach can reduce time and cost, and increase specificity. Only immunogenic regions of antigenic epitopes of the S protein of MERS-COV were screened to identify potential vaccine candidates. Sequence, structure, conservation and interaction analyses were conducted to discover epitopes of B- and T-cells that are antigenic and conserved among MERS-COV isolates from eight different countries, that may serve as vaccine candidates. The small number of antigenic epitopes identified in this study might deliver a preliminary set of epitopes for future vaccines against MERS-COV, which may help to control this growing health threat.",
