The seven classes are positive-sense, negative-sense and double-stranded RNA viruses, single-stranded and double-stranded DNA viruses, retroviruses, and pararetroviruses (Baltimore 1971). Of these, the single-stranded positive-sense or (+)ssRNA viruses comprise the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses (Dolja and Koonin 2011). The group includes many important human and animal pathogens (such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, hepatitis C, foot-and-mouth disease, polio, chikungunya, SARS, and MERS viruses) besides the majority of plant viruses.",

In recent years, a number of \u2018hidden\u2019 protein-coding open-reading frames (ORFs) have been discovered in the genomes of various (+)ssRNA viruses (Chung et al. 2008; Loughran, Firth, and Atkins 2011; Fang et al. 2012; Firth 2014; Smirnova et al. 2015; Napthine et al. 2017; Lulla et al. 2019). Such genes tend to be very short and/or to overlap previously known coding ORFs, explaining why they have escaped detection prior to the application of sensitive comparative genomic methods. However, all of these experimentally verified novel coding ORFs are in the positive sense. To our knowledge, no negative-sense coding ORF has ever been demonstrated in any (+)ssRNA virus. Thus, an unanswered question in virology is whether the negative strand of (+)ssRNA viruses can encode proteins.",

Similar to other narnaviruses, one strand contains a single long ORF that encodes a protein inferred by homology to be the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). However, we were surprised to notice that both sequences also contain a reverse-frame ORF (rORF) covering nearly the entire sequence of \u223c3,000 nt. We also identified related rORF-containing sequences in public Puccinia striiformis and Uromyces appendiculatus transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) data sets. The extreme divergences between these sequences and the mosquito-associated sequences (\u223c22% amino acid identity in the RdRp sequence) effectively rule out a region of such length being preserved free of stop codons by chance, and thus we hypothesized that the rORF represented a bona fide protein-coding sequence.",

Both genera contain single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses which are non-encapsidated and hence are expected to be transmitted either vertically though cell division or horizontally during host mating. Mitoviruses replicate in the mitochondria of host cells whereas narnaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm. These viruses were originally described as infecting fungi, but related viruses have since been observed in transcriptomic data sets derived from diverse organisms. The narnaviral positive strand normally contains a single long ORF that covers most of the genome and encodes an RdRp which catalyses viral replication. The narnaviral RdRp is highly divergent from those of other eukaryotic RNA viruses, and shows closer homology to the RdRps of RNA bacteriophages in the family Leviviridae (Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o, Esteban, and Esteban 1991; Esteban, Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o, and Esteban 1992; Wolf et al. 2018). Detailed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the Narnaviridae are descended from a levivirus-like bacteriophage which may have been carried within the bacterial progenitor of mitochondria at the point of eukaryogenesis, followed by loss of the capsid protein giving rise to capsidless (\u2018naked\u2019) RNA elements (Koonin, Dolja, and Krupovic 2015; Wolf et al. 2018). The escape of a group of these viruses into the cytosol may have given rise to the Narnavirus genus (Koonin and Dolja 2014; Wolf et al. 2018).",

ScNV-20S persistently infects most laboratory strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas fewer strains carry ScNV-23S. Their genomes have no 3\u2032 poly(A) tail and it is not known if they have a 5\u2032 cap structure (Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez-Cousi\u00f1o et al. 1998). The genomes do not encode capsids, but form ribonucleoprotein complexes with the RdRp in a 1:1 stoichiometry in the host cell cytoplasm; the RdRp interacts with both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends which may help protect the viral RNA from degradation by host exonucleases (Sol\u00f3rzano et al. 2000; Fujimura and Esteban 2004; Fujimura and Esteban 2007). Under suitably inducing conditions such as heat shock and nitrogen starvation, copy numbers of either virus can reach 100,000 copies per cell (Kadowaki and Halvorson 1971; Wejksnora and Haber 1978; Esteban, Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o, and Esteban 1992). Approximately 98\u201399 per cent of viral RNA in the cell is in a single-stranded positive-sense form, whereas the remainder exists as single-stranded negative-sense replication intermediates (Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o, Esteban, and Esteban 1991; Fujimura, Sol\u00f3rzano, and Esteban 2005). When cells are grown at high temperature, double-stranded forms (known as W for ScNV-20S and T for ScNV-23S) accumulate, but these appear to represent by-products and not replication intermediates (Wesolowski and Wickner 1984; Rodr\u0131\u00b4guez-Cousi\u00f1o et al. 1998; Fujimura, Sol\u00f3rzano, and Esteban 2005).",

Overall codon usage is similar in alphanarnaviruses with and without long rORFs, but the former display a highly specific avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons over large regions of the RdRp ORF, corresponding to an absence of stop codons in the rORF. We explore possible reasons for the avoidance of CUA, UUA, and UCA and conclude that the most plausible explanation is selection to maintain an rORF, indicating that the rORF is functional.",

            "text": "We completed three genomic sequences for previously described rORF-containing narnaviruses (Cook et al. 2013), and used these genomes as a reference set for comparative analyses. The sequences with GenBank accession numbers KF298275.1, KF298276.1, and KF298284.1 were extended at their 5\u2032 termini by 479 nt, 10 nt, and 364 nt, respectively, and at their 3\u2032 termini by 43 nt, 9 nt, and 9 nt, respectively (Fig. 1A). The latter two sequences are the same length (3093 nt) and encode RdRps which are 97.95 per cent identical at the amino acid level; hence, they were considered to represent a single viral species. Given that the samples from which these sequences were originally obtained were isolated from mosquitoes in the Ochlerotatus genus, we name the viruses Ochlerotatus-associated narna-like virus 1 (ONLV1; sequence KF298275.1) and ONLV2 (sequences KF298276.1 and KF298284.1) (Fig. 1A). The AUG codons of the three RdRp ORFs each start at the 7th nucleotide of the respective sequences (contexts: GUCAUGA, GUUAUGG, and GUUAUGG), the same position as that of the RdRp AUG in ScNV-23S (GenBank: NC_004050.1). The RdRp-encoding ORFs are 3045, 3075, and 3075 nucleotides in length, respectively. The RdRp stop codons (UGA, UAA, and UAA) end at positions 14 nt, 13 nt, and 13 nt, respectively, from the 3\u2032 termini of the genomes. Hence, the length of the 3\u2032 UTR mirrors closely that of ScNV-20S (12 nt; GenBank: NC_004051.1) but is shorter than that of ScNV-23S (59 nt).\n",

As expected, the free-floating genus Ourmiavirus, which includes plant-associated viruses with tripartite genomes, grouped unambiguously with the narnaviruses (Rastgou et al. 2009; Turina et al. 2017; Wolf et al. 2018), whereas mitoviruses formed a sister clade (Fig. 1B). A relatively small, but highly diverse set of fungal- and arthropod-derived sequences clustered with the ourmiaviruses (Fig. 1B). Recent evidence shows that these \u2018ourmia-like\u2019 viruses display a range of genomic architectures, which can be segmented (as in the case of the bona fide ourmiaviruses) or non-segmented, occurring in mono- and di-cistronic forms (reviewed in Dolja and Koonin 2018). For example, botrytis ourmia-like virus, which appears to have a non-segmented genome, clusters unambiguously with ourmiaviruses rather than with the narnaviruses (Donaire, Rozas, and Ayll\u00f3n 2016; Fig. 1B). Unlike classical narnaviruses and mitoviruses, ourmiaviruses encode a capsid protein on one of their genome segments, and some of the \u2018ourmia-like\u2019 viruses encode a capsid protein in a separate ORF on the RdRp-encoding RNA (Dolja and Koonin 2018).",

Effectively by definition, each of these three codons is excluded from large portions of sequences with long rORFs (mean usage per associated amino acid in RdRp ORF = 0.0037, 0.0054, and 0.0056, respectively), but are 17- to 26-fold more common in those alphanarnaviruses without long rORFs (mean usage per associated amino acid = 0.0973, 0.0896, and 0.1277, respectively) (Fig. 6A).

The PCA allowed clear segregation of arthropods from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (two major fungal phyla) and streptophytes (land plants and some green algae), but the latter three groups did not clearly segregate from each other (Supplementary Fig. S6). Narnaviral codon usage statistics were projected onto the resulting principal component space, and did not clearly segregate with a single host group, regardless of whether or not leucine and serine codons were included in the analysis (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7).

            "text": "In this study, we have shown that narnaviral sequences form two major clades, which we suggest to be formally recognized as a pair of genera. We show that sequences with long rORFs are restricted to the proposed genus Alphanarnavirus, which also contains the prototypical Saccharomyces cerevisiae 20S and 23S narnaviruses. The proposed genus Betanarnavirus contains viruses associated with diverse unicellular eukaryotes, including the oomycete Phytophthora infestans and the trypanosomatid Leptomonas seymouri. The two proposed genera differ in terms of their relative codon usage preferences and in the composition of their genomic termini, with alphanarnaviruses having GC-rich termini and a higher overall GC3 content in codons, and the betanarnaviruses having AU-rich termini. These variations might, to some extent, reflect divergence in host taxa. Although some of the available sequences are likely incomplete, there is evidence that members of both proposed genera exhibit complementarity between the genomic termini. In ScNV-20S and ScNV-23S, the 5\u2032-GGGG and CCCC-3\u2032 genomic termini, besides 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RNA structures, are essential for efficient virus replication (Esteban and Fujimura 2003; Fujimura and Esteban 2004; Esteban, Vega, and Fujimura 2005). Since narnaviral RNAs are non-polyadenylated and probably non-capped, they are vulnerable to host mRNA degradation pathways. However, the viral RdRp binds to the 3\u2032-terminal CCCC and an adjacent RNA stem-loop structure in the positive strand and this is thought to stabilize the genome and protect the 3\u2032 end from host 3\u2032 exonuclease degradation (Fujimura and Esteban 2004, 2007). Similar elements also exist at the 3\u2032 end of the negative strand (Esteban, Vega, and Fujimura 2005; Fujimura and Esteban 2007). Meanwhile, the positive-strand 5\u2032-proximal RNA structure protects the genome from the host SKI1/XRN1 5\u2032 exonuclease (Esteban, Vega, and Fujimura 2008). These stability elements are thought to be particularly important for narnaviruses due to the lack of capsids or membrane-associated replication that other (+)ssRNA viruses use to protect their genomes (Fujimura and Esteban 2007).",

For example, in Fig. 2: two TSA sequences from the fly-infecting fungus Entomophthora muscae (GENC01006608.1 and GEND01011317.1) cluster within a clade of arthropod-derived sequences; a TSA sequence (GFKT011160020.1) from the spider Nephila clavipes has 95 per cent nucleotide identity to ScNV-20S (AF039063.1); and two TSA sequences (GGCO01105932.1 and GGCO01034162.1) from the barley plant Hordeum vulgare cluster with sequences derived from the Basidiomycota obligate plant pathogenic fungi Uromyces appendiculatus and Puccinia striiformis. Since ScNV-20S is a well-characterized virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is likely that the Nephila clavipes sequence derives from fungal contamination. The Entomophthora muscae sequences were obtained from fungus-infected Delia radicum cabbage flies, and indeed the NCBI SRA taxonomy analysis webpages (alpha version, 30 May 2019) for the corresponding RNA-Seq libraries show 4\u201316 times as much fly RNA as fungal RNA (within the only 8\u20139 per cent of reads that were taxonomically identified); thus these TSAs may derive from infected insect cells. Similarly, the Hordeum vulgare TSAs may derive from infected fungal cells since the NCBI SRA taxonomy analysis webpages show contamination with Opisthokonta (i.e. animal/fungi) RNA at \u223c4 per cent the level of plant RNA. Thus, it is important to apply caution when attempting to infer the hosts of TSA sequences.",

More recently, evidence was put forward that at least some narnaviruses may be true arthropod viruses: for example, the group of alphanarnaviruses comprising KF298275.1, KF298276.1, KF298284.1, Zhejiang mosquito virus 3, KP642119.1 and KP642120.1 (Fig. 2) come from four different studies and five different Culicinae mosquito species (Chandler et al. 2015; Cook et al. 2013; Shi et al. 2016, 2017); moreover, in several samples, viral RNA accounts for >0.1 per cent (in one case, >2%) of total non-ribosomal RNA reads, which may be unlikely if the virus is infecting a contaminant (Shi et al. 2016, 2017). Very recently, another narnavirus in this clade (MK628543.1; Culex narnavirus 1; 97 per cent nt identity to KP642120.1) was found to persistently infect a Culex tarsalis cell culture and also give rise to typical 21-nt viral siRNAs with equal coverage of both strands, indicative of active infection (G\u00f6ertz et al. 2019). An ONLV2-related EVE has been previously reported for arthropods (Shi et al. 2016), and we also identified sequences that clustered with rORF-containing narnaviruses in WGS assembly data sets from several species of ant, the seven spot ladybird and the glassy winged sharpshooter. On the other hand, it has also been suggested that arthropod-associated narnaviruses may instead be infecting trypanosomatids\u2014common parasites of arthropods (Harvey et al. 2019) (trypanosomatid DNA\u2014including EVEs\u2014could potentially also contaminate WGS data sets of their hosts). Other rORF-containing alphanarnaviruses come from fungal (or plant) samples that have no obvious association with arthropods (<0.8% metazoan-mapping reads in total per sample), such as the Uromyces appendiculatus and Puccinia striiformis samples, indicating that presence of the rORF is likely not a unique adaptation to arthropod-association.",

These rORF-containing sequences appear not to form a monophyletic group, although they do show considerable phylogenetic clustering. The rORF occurs exclusively in the R0 frame relative to the RdRp ORF, and large sections of the latter therefore exhibit a specific exclusion of the three codons CUA, UUA, and UCA, which are however widely used in the RdRp ORF of non-rORF-containing narnaviruses. Nonetheless, these codons are still used occasionally in rORF-containing narnaviruses, exclusively within the 5\u2032-most extremity (3%) of the RdRp coding region (at or upstream of the rORF stop codon). This indicates that selection against these codons is not due to an inability for these codons to be decoded by the host translational machinery (e.g. due to the lack of cognate tRNAs). This is also supported by our analysis of cellular organism codon usage which showed that the vast majority of organisms with GC3 in the same range as rORF-containing narnaviruses have CUA, UUA, and UCA mean codon usage values well above those of the rORF-containing narnaviruses (Fig. 6B). Thus, the presence of the long rORF in highly divergent alphanarnaviruses cannot be explained as an artefact of RdRp ORF codon usage or GC bias.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence for protein-coding ORFs in the negative strand of any (+)ssRNA virus. A recent bioinformatic study used single-sequence randomization procedures to identify ORFs overlapping previously annotated ORFs in RNA virus sequences that are statistically significantly longer than expected by chance, with the assumption being that such ORFs are likely to be functional (Schlub, Buchmann, and Holmes 2018). The authors identified statistically significantly long negative-strand stop-codon-free regions overlapping positive-strand ORFs in sweet potato virus 2 (NC_017970.1; family Potyviridae), Macrophomina phaseolina tobamo-like virus (NC_025674.1; family Virgaviridae), Nhumirim virus (NC_024017.1; family Flaviviridae), hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (NC_003608.1; family Tombusviridae), hydrangea ringspot virus (NC_006943.1; family Alphaflexiviridae), and Scrophularia mottle virus (NC_011537.1; family Tymoviridae). However, it remains unclear how these ORFs would be translated. In eukaryotes, translation normally relies on recruitment of pre-initiation ribosomes to the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs, followed by scanning and initiation at the first AUG in a good initiation context. Thus, the majority of de novo protein-coding ORFs tend to evolve towards the 5\u2032 ends of transcripts, frequently overlapping the 5\u2032 end of an ancestral protein-coding ORF where they can be translated via a process known as leaky scanning (Firth and Brierley 2012). If protein-coding ORFs exist in the negative strand of (+)ssRNA viruses, one might expect the majority to have initiation sites close to the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand. However for the six ORFs above there are, respectively, 171, 101, 115, 8, 3, and 100 intervening AUG codons between the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand and the first in-frame AUG codon in the ORF, which would appear to rule out 5\u2032-end-dependent scanning as a translation mechanism. 5\u2032-Distal ORFs on positive-sense transcripts are often translated via ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough, but that still requires 5\u2032-proximal initiation in the pre-frameshift/pre-readthrough ORF (Firth and Brierley 2012). 5\u2032-Distal ORFs are occasionally translated via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), but IRESes are normally complex elements and it would be difficult for them to evolve within protein-coding sequences. Simple inefficient IRESes are a possibility and, compounded with the low availability of negative strand, would lead to extremely low expression levels of any resulting proteins. Splicing is unknown in (+)ssRNA viruses as they all replicate cytoplasmically. Subgenome-sized negative-sense transcripts, where they are produced, are normally 5\u2032 co-terminal with the full-length negative strand so would not normally provide access to internal ORFs, although the production of other classes of negative-sense transcripts is plausible (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska, Stollar, and Bujarski 2011). Given the pronounced evolutionary adaptations that might be required to express such negative-strand ORFs, in the absence of experimental data they would be more plausible if they were conserved in related species. However, this has not been demonstrated. For example, the Nhumirim virus rORF is not conserved in the next most closely related flavivirus genome sequence, that of Barkedji virus (MG214906.1; 71% aa identity in the forward ORF) where the rORF region is disrupted by eight stop codons. Similarly, the sweet potato virus 2 rORF is not conserved in sweet potato virus G (NC_018093.1; 74% aa identity in the forward ORF) where the rORF region is disrupted by nine stop codons. Indeed, it is not even conserved in other isolates of sweet potato virus 2\u2014e.g. KP729268.1 and KP115618.1 each have a stop codon. Thus, we contend that the alphanarnavirus rORF is currently the only plausible candidate for a negative-strand coding ORF in (+)ssRNA viruses.",

            "text": "The replication of most (+)ssRNA viruses is membrane-associated (den Boon and Ahlquist 2010; Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager 2014; Shulla and Randall 2016; Ertel et al. 2017). Infection typically results in extensive rearrangement of host membranes to produce membrane-bound mini-organelles within which genome replication occurs. These structures co-localize viral RNA and proteins and may also shield viral positive:negative strand duplexes from recognition by host dsRNA-recognizing antiviral factors such as RIG-I, MDA-5, PKR, and the RNAi machinery. Sequestering replication within membranous compartments may also play a role in separation of translation from replication: positive-sense mRNAs are extruded into the cytoplasm for translation, whereas the negative strand remains protected within the membranous compartment for replication. This prevents ribosomes translating 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 from colliding with RdRps tracking 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 on the same template. Thus, at least at later time points, the negative strand is expected to be generally sequestered away from the translational machinery. Further, the negative strand of (+)ssRNA viruses often lacks the 5\u2032 structures (such as a 5\u2032 cap, 5\u2032 covalently linked viral protein of the genome, or IRES structure) required to efficiently recruit ribosomes. Narnavirus replication is, however, quite atypical among eukaryote-infecting (+)ssRNA viruses, and this may explain why they\u2014possibly uniquely\u2014appear to have evolved negative-strand coding capacity. Narnavirus replication is thought to occur entirely within the cytoplasm, not associated with cellular membranes (Sol\u00f3rzano et al. 2000; Fujimura, Sol\u00f3rzano, and Esteban 2005). As mentioned above, the narnavirus RdRp is more closely related to the RdRp of bacteriophages in the family Leviviridae than it is to the RdRp of other (+)ssRNA viruses. Similar to leviviruses, the RNA in narnavirus replication intermediates is essentially single-stranded (Blumenthal and Carmichael 1979; Dobkin et al. 1979; Zinder 1980; Takeshita and Tomita 2012; Fujimura, Sol\u00f3rzano, and Esteban 2005; Wickner, Fujimura, and Esteban 2013). Each newly synthesized RNA is released before a new round of replication commences and resting complexes comprising a negative-sense or positive-sense single-stranded RNA bound to a single copy of the viral RdRp are present within the cytoplasm (Sol\u00f3rzano et al. 2000). Thus, for narnaviruses, the positive and negative strands likely have similar accessibility to the host cell translational machinery.",

            "text": "The rORF is present in many but not all alphanarnaviruses. Surprisingly, the distribution of the rORF does not appear to be monophyletic. Thus it may have evolved multiple times, or it may have been present ancestrally and lost from some lineages. The observation that the rORF is always in the R0 frame relative to the RdRp ORF may be evidence against independent evolution in multiple lineages, although it could also be a consequence of codon bias, e.g. if long ORFs are by chance more likely to occur in the R0 frame as a result of RdRp ORF codon usage. Such random ORFs could provide \u2018seeds\u2019 for the evolution of longer overlapping genes (Belshaw, Pybus, and Rambaut 2007). Another surprising feature is that the rORF, where present, is nearly always full-length. If the sole function of the rORF were to encode an additional protein, one might expect to see a variety of rORF lengths in different lineages whereas we only see a single example of an rORF beginning within 200 nt of the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand with length in the range 24\u201394 per cent of the full sequence length (Fig. 4). In contrast to the RdRp, we found little evidence for conserved amino acid motifs in the rORF protein (Fig. 7). It is possible that the very high divergence between most of our sequences might obscure a weak conservation signature (in contrast to the RdRp which is the most highly conserved RNA virus protein known). However, it is also possible that the protein product of the rORF is not itself functionally important. A possible alternative explanation is that rORF translation in itself might facilitate replication e.g. by disassociating dsRNA, or by increasing negative strand RNA stability (Bicknell and Ricci 2017). Alternatively, if the negative strand is unavoidably accessible for translation, exon-junction-complex-independent non sense mediated decay (Kurosaki, Popp, and Maquat 2019) may provide strong selection pressure against non-full-length rORFs.",

The alphanarnavirus rORFs are exceedingly long compared to most known overlapping genes (Pavesi et al. 2018; Brandes and Linial 2016). Thus their study is not only of interest to the evolution and molecular biology of viruses, but also of broad relevance to understanding the evolution of overlapping genes and the de novo origin of genes. During revision of this manuscript, a related study was also published (DeRisi et al. 2019).",
