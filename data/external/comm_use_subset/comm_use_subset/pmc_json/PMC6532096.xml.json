            "text": "The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is the world\u2019s largest extant carnivorous marsupial and is found in the wild only on the island state of Tasmania, Australia. As this animal is predominately a scavenger, its diet largely comprises carrion of mammals, including wallabies, possums, and kangaroos, although it may also consume and digest fish, insects, fruit, and vegetation (1, 2). Listed as endangered, the Tasmanian devil is facing the threat of extinction due to a contagious cancer, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD1 and -2), that has caused drastic (77%) declines in wild devil populations since its discovery in 1996 (3). In an attempt to save the species from extinction, an insurance population was established in 2006 to supplement wild populations at risk of population crashes (4, 5). While extensive research has focused on DFTD, susceptibility to DFTD, and devil genetic diversity (6\u201310), understanding of other disease threats to devils remains limited. The gut microbiome has been characterized (11), but virological studies are limited to the identification of a single gammaherpesvirus (dasyurid herpesvirus 2 [DaHV-2]), for which captivity was identified as a significant risk factor (12). Characterization of viral diversity among Tasmanian devils is an essential step to improve understanding of host-microbe relationships, and for conservation management of the species. Comparative analysis of marsupial viruses with those from diverse vertebrate hosts, including eutherian mammals, birds, and other vertebrates, will also provide a deeper understanding of the phylogenetic history of the viruses infecting this evolutionary unique group of mammals (13, 14).",

Removal of nonviral genomic host and bacterial nucleic acids is often necessary for the detection of low-titer viruses (17, 18). More recently, the use of RNA sequencing of total non-rRNA from environmental samples gave rise to viral metatranscriptomics, which has been successfully applied to characterize the viromes of diverse invertebrate and vertebrate species (13, 19, 20). To our knowledge, no studies to date have directly compared these two approaches to virome characterization, although doing so would allow us to understand the detection capabilities and biases associated with different nucleic acid extraction and sample treatment methods.",

Metatranscriptomic sequencing resulted in 128 to 140 million reads per pool (793,038,436 reads in total), which were assembled de novo into 196,919 to 358,327 contigs (Table 1).

Mapping reads to the Tasmanian devil genome revealed that 10.75 to 18.99% of reads originated from the host.

RHDV is used as a biocontrol for rabbits in Australia and causes fatal hepatitis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and some hare species (22). Using metatranscriptomics, we detected genomes with high nucleotide and amino acid similarity (>98%) to RHDV in one of the wild devil metatranscriptomic libraries (Buckbys Road [BR]), with genome coverage of 98.1%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the major capsid and nonstructural protein genes revealed that the RHDV detected in this study clustered with RHDV variant GI.2 (also called RHDV2) (Fig. 3a and b), which was first detected in Australia in May 2015 and has since become the dominant circulating variant nationwide. RHDV-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing confirmed the presence of RHDV2 in four of the nine devil fecal samples from the BR metatranscriptomics pool. In addition, no rabbit-associated genes were detected during the initial sequence analysis. Additional PCR targeting a short fragment of rabbit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (<300 bp) also did not detect any rabbit DNA in the original fecal samples from BR. Further RT-PCR and sequencing performed on the fecal RNA extractions from the remaining pools confirmed the presence of RHDV in 1 of 10 devils from wukalina/Mt William National Park (wMW), two of nine devils from zoo A, and one of nine from zoo B. One of the four additional RHDV-positive samples, from zoo A, contained rabbit mtDNA as confirmed by PCR.",

Similarly, in a previous study comparing various enrichment methods, bacteriophage accounted for >80% of all reads in all of the enrichment methods tested but <5% when no enrichment steps were incorporated (29). Despite being able to substantially increase the total number of viral reads in the metagenomes, sequence-independent amplification is bias prone, resulting in fewer viruses detected and lower genome coverage due to preferential amplification of certain sequences (30\u201332). However, the overrepresentation of bacteriophage here may partly be attributed to the fact that they make up the bulk of the gut virobiota, which is dominated by bacteria (33, 34). Regardless of its known bias (29, 30), virion-enriched metagenomics still holds merit for use in virome characterization due to its ability to identify low-abundance DNA viruses, which is especially relevant for dormant or nonactive viruses.",

In this study, the proportion of viral reads sequenced by metatranscriptomics was <2% per library, but the numbers of viral groups detected were significantly higher than those detected in virion-enriched metagenomics, which included both RNA and DNA viruses. Importantly, then, our results show that the taxonomic compositions of viral communities as revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. However, these two approaches were complementary, and an integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics will be a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities in a sample.",

Both captive populations displayed lower levels of viral diversity than the wild populations. This loss of diversity is consistent with changes previously observed in the gut bacteriome, where captive devils also exhibited lower bacterial diversity compared to wild devils (11). Changes in lifestyle and diet that occur in captivity likely impact the virome, which is similarly dynamic. Interestingly, Maria Island devils had viromes more similar to those of the captive populations. Maria Island, a 115-km2 island off the east coast of Tasmania (Fig. 1), is home to approximately 100 free-ranging devils. Two factors may have contributed to the lower viral diversity observed on Maria Island. First, due to its isolation from mainland Tasmania, animal movements or immigrations are limited to only marine or bird species, and nonendemic species diversity is lower. Thus, there may be limited introduction of viruses to the island. Second, captive-born devils may be more likely to have a \u201ccaptive-type\u201d virome, that is, lower viral diversity than wild devils. Indeed, some devils included in this study are captive-born animals recently translocated to Maria Island. As samples were pooled prior to sequencing, it was not possible to distinguish between viromes of captive-born and wild-born devils.",

It is also important to note that some of these viruses may in fact be dietary viruses, with no active replication in devils, or may occur naturally as part of the normal gut flora of Tasmanian devils. For example, in some areas of Tasmania, rabbits are common and likely ingested by wild devils, which might explain the presence of RHDV2 in wild devils. They are also regularly fed to devils in captivity. Feeding records provided by the two zoos in this study confirmed the feeding of rabbits to some of the sampled devils around the time of fecal collection. While we did not detect rabbit genes by metatranscriptomics, virion-enriched metagenomics, or PCR in any of the wild devil samples that tested positive for RHDV, we did detect rabbit mtDNA in the feces of one captive devil from zoo A that tested positive for RHDV by PCR. Targeted investigations such as PCR of blood or internal tissues (i.e., liver), in situ hybridization, and serological assays are required to determine whether these viruses can actively replicate and cause disease in devils or are simply gut contaminants. Nevertheless, exposure to host-adapted viruses could pose significant health threats, especially for devils that are immunocompromised due to old age, DFTD, or other concurrent diseases (36, 37). Furthermore, even commensal or latent viral infections can be exacerbated or reactivated in immunocompromised hosts (38, 39).",

Generally, long-term relationships between viruses and hosts are expected for mammalian viruses (13). Strong evidence for this lies in the observation that devil viruses are usually clustered with other marsupial viruses, as a marsupial-specific lineage that is distinct from the eutherian viruses, as observed in herpesvirus, papillomavirus (45, 46), and polyomavirus (Fig. S1 to S5). Furthermore, in several cases the branching order of viruses broadly reflects that of their hosts such that a general codivergence can be inferred. For instance, in the phylogenies of Picornaviridae and Astroviridae, the Tasmanian devil-associated (marsupial) viruses formed a sister clade to eutherian viruses, which, in turn, are sister to avian viruses, consistent with the evolutionary history of the host. Although such a relationship is not observed in every virus phylogeny, a deep divergence between eutherian and marsupial viruses is typical of our data set. This observation indicates that the timescale of virus evolution is very likely to reflect that of the hosts (13).",
