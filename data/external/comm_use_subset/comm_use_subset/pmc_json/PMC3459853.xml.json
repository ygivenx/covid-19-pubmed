Despite progress in the development of antibiotics and other supportive care therapies, severe sepsis remains an unconquered challenge for the clinicians with an unacceptable high mortality rate of 30%\u201350% [1]. The response to infection is diverse among different individuals. Given the same therapies, most sepsis patients will recover and do well, while a small, but significant portion, will develop severe sepsis and multiple organ system failure, refractory hypotension and death [2], [3]. Currently, more and more evidence showed that genetic factors played an important role in the development and severity of sepsis [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Common sequence variants within genes involved in pro-inflammatory response have received particular attention [12], [13].",

            "text": "Although the pathogenesis of sepsis remains incompletely understood, an excessive pro-inflammatory response has been established as a fundamental component of severe sepsis [14]. The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 is an essential component in the host immune response to infection and has been widely reported to be an important mediator in severe sepsis and septic shock. High circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 were correlated with poor outcomes in sepsis patients [15]. TNF-\u03b1 and lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LT-\u03b1) share the same receptors as well as many biological activities, and they are central mediators of immune responses [16]. TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 are encoded by adjacent gene loci in the central or class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), between the HLA class I and II genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 [17]. Several SNPs within the promoter region of TNF (\u2212238, \u2212308, \u2212857, \u2212863, \u22121031) and the first intron of LTA (+252) were thought to influence TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 production, and have therefore been identified as candidate variants that might influence susceptibility to and/or outcomes from severe sepsis and infectious diseases [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. In particular, rs1800629 (TNF \u2212308) and rs909253 (LTA +252) have been the focus of many investigations on sepsis. Although several studies have identified associations for rs1800629 and rs909253 with sepsis risk or outcomes [18], [19], [20], [23], [24], other studies have not replicated the associations [21], [26], [27], [28]. This inconsistency may be due to small samples size studied and ethnic differences [29].",

TNFR1-deficient mice are resistant to endotoxic shock and have prolonged survival with less hypothermia [31]. TNFR2 influences the biological activity of TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 both in a membrane-bound and a soluble form. Membrane-bound TNFR2 facilitates activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades upon binding with TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1, whereas soluble TNFR2 is capable of binding and inactivating circulating TNF-\u03b1 and LT-\u03b1 [16], [30]. Moreover, animal studies showed that TNFR2 mediated protective effects in the development of severe sepsis [31]. Recent studies proposed that genetic variation in TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B was associated with susceptibility to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as tuberculosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [32], [33], [34], [35]. However, to date, only one study investigated the role of TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B polymorphisms in sepsis susceptibility and mortality [36].",

Our results provided evidence that rs1800629, a functional SNP in the promoter region of TNF, was significantly associated with susceptibility to severe sepsis in Chinese Han population. The association between rs1800629 and severe sepsis risk may be explained by its influence on the expression of TNF-\u03b1. In this study, we found that the risk allele (rs1800629A) is associated with increased TNF-\u03b1 production in PBMCs from healthy subjects after stimulation with LPS. Moreover, we found that TNF-\u03b1 serum levels in severe sepsis patients with AA+AG genotypes for rs1800629 were significantly higher than those in the individuals with GG genotype. Previous studies also showed that rs1800629A allele was associated with a six fold higher expression of both basal and induced TNF mRNA [39], [40]. Menges et al. found that the plasma TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in patients with sepsis secondary to severe traumatic injury were significantly elevated in rs1800629A carriers on the first day after admission and for the following 14 days [41]. As TNF-\u03b1 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis in response to infection, it is reasonable to assume that patients with rs1800629A allele might produce a higher amount of TNF-\u03b1, and therefore become more susceptible to severe sepsis. In contrast to the TNF \u2212308G/A polymorphism, the LTA +252A/G was not associated with the development of severe sepsis in our study. Our data showed that \u2212308G/A of TNF and +252A/G of LTA were in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD) (D\u2032 = 0.118) in Chinese Han population. The LD pattern is quite dissimilar to Caucasian population, which might result from the racial difference [24].",

However, up to now, only one case control study investigated associations between TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B polymorphisms and sepsis susceptibility [36]. Four potentially functional SNPs in TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were genotyped in our study. However, none showed association with susceptibility to or death from severe sepsis in Chinese Han population. Our findings were consistent with the results of Gordon et al. that five functional SNPs in TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were not associated with susceptibility to or outcomes from sepsis in Caucasian population [36].",

First, although we knew that different pathogens had different impact on severity and outcomes of sepsis, we did not perform stratification analysis by different pathogens due to small number of cases with a definite microbiologic diagnosis. Second, we did not resequence these genes or select tag SNPs for genotyping. Instead, only ten potentially functional SNPs in TNF, LTA, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B were included in our study, which was far from comprehensive. Indeed, these four genes are highly polymorphic. Therefore, it was possible that some important SNPs might be missed or the observed association might be due to other polymorphisms in LD with the studied ones. Additionally, assuming the prevalence of 0.01 for severe sepsis and using a significance level of 0.05, our study with 432 severe sepsis patients and 624 healthy controls had about 80% power to detect a 5% risk allele with an odds ratio of 1.63. Variant with an effect size smaller than this cannot convincingly be excluded based on these results. Therefore, our results cannot exclude variant associations with weaker effects between severe sepsis and the other three candidate genes (LTA, TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B). A more highly powered study involving thousands of subjects may yet exclude the role of these variants in severe sepsis susceptibility and outcomes.",

Exclusion criteria included age below 18 years, pregnancy, severe chronic respiratory disease, severe chronic liver disease (defined as a Child\u2013Pugh score of >10), malignancy, using of high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and AIDS diagnosis.

The test for association with genotypes used the global genotype test in the 3\u00d72 contingency table. Allele frequencies of cases and controls were used to calculate the OR and the 95% CI. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounding factors. When comparing severe sepsis group to sepsis group, we entered the genotypes or alleles in the multivariate models controlling for the confounding variables including age, gender, history of diseases, source of infection, APACHE II and SOFA scores. When comparing severe sepsis patients to healthy controls, age and gender were included in the multivariate models. The Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons where applicable. The power analysis was performed using the Genetic Power Calculator web tool [45]. A two tailed P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant, whereas a value of corrected P<(0.05/number of tests) was considered significant after Bonferroni correction. Continuous variables were described as either a mean \u00b1 standard deviation, or as a median with interquartile range.
