Significant success has been achieved in HIV-1 treatment since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the 1990s [1].

In the last several decades, great progress has been made in the understanding of the mechanisms of HIV-1 entry into host cells. It involves the binding of viral glycoprotein gp120 to the cellular CD4 receptor, and subsequent reconfiguration of gp120 to allow the interaction of gp120 and a cellular coreceptor, i.e., CCR5 or CXCR4. The interaction was followed by additional conformational changes in the viral envelope, resulting in exposure of gp41 transmembrane protein and ultimately driving the fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane [3,4,5,6,7,8]. To date, the CCR5 antagonists maraviroc (MVC) and the fusion inhibitor targeting gp41, T20 (enfuvirtide) have been approved for clinical use, and many other inhibitors targeting various stages of viral entry are still in development [9,10].",

            "text": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) are early transition metal clusters linked to oxygen and other atoms. POMs exhibit a great diversity in structure and are widely used as catalysts in material sciences and medicine. Two basic structures of POMs, Keggin and Dawson, have attracted attention owing to their antiviral properties, and these POMs have been shown to have activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses, including influenza A and B, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-V), respiratory syncytial virus and dengue virus [11,12,13,14,15]. The POM known as ammonium-21-tungsto-9-antimoniate (HPA-23) ended with an HIV/AIDS clinical trial in the 1980s. This compound failed due to unacceptable adverse effects and minor benefits [16,17,18]. Since then, several groups have synthesized and identified a number of new generations of POMs with improved potency and reduced toxicity [18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27], although the mechanisms remain unclear. We have previously identified the anti-HIV activity of a number of Keggin POMs and derivatives [28]. In the present work, we evaluated the potency and mechanism of action of a Keggin polyoxometalate PT-1 (K6HPTi2W10O40, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, CCDC: 1440344) in the prevention of HIV-1 entry.",

In MT4 cells, the replication of the wide-type virus was significantly inhibited by PT-1 at IC50 ranging from 0.47 to 1.56 \u00b5M.

In addition to its remarkable high potency, PT-1 showed low cytotoxicity in TZM-bl, MT4 cells and PBMCs, even at a concentration that was 100-fold higher than the effective dose (Figure 1C and Table 1). No significant changes in the percentage of early and late apoptotic cells were seen in PBMCs and MT4 cells after PT-1 treatment (Figure 1D and Figure S1).

PT-1, CCR5 inhibitor MVC and fusion inhibitor T20 showed inhibition from 0 h to 2 h, indicating that PT-1 inhibited a very early step of virus replication, possibly the viral entry process. We next analyzed the effects of PT-1 on the attachment of HIV-1 Env protein to target cells by comparing Env pseudotyped and VSV-G pseudotyped virus infection using TZM-bl assays. As noted in Figure 2B, inhibition was abolished after replacement of the HIV-1 envelope with VSV-G, although no differences of inhibition were observed in AZT treated cells (Figure 2C), indicating that PT-1 specifically interacted with the HIV-1 glycoproteins.",

We then analyzed the binding of PT-1 to CD4 recombinant protein using a direct binding assay, where CD4 protein was immobilized on a CM5 chip, and PT-1 was run in a serial of dilutions. The average KD value for the PT-1-CD4 interaction was 1.58 \u00b5M using a 1:1 langmuir binding model (Figure 3B). To further elucidate the binding ability of PT-1 to the natural CD4 receptor, we co-incubated PT-1 with MT4 cells and stained the cells with anti-CD4 RPA-T4 antibodies, which bind to the D1 domain (gp120 binding domain) of CD4. FACS analysis revealed that PT-1 suppressed the fluorescence intensity in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3C)., In addition, PT-1 incubation did not induce IL-2 secretion (Figure S3), suggesting that PT-1 may interfere with the gp120 binding site on the CD4 receptor without activating CD4 T cells. We also compared the effects of PT-1 on CCR5-(YU2) and CXCR4-(NL4-3) utilizing strains; however, no differences were observed. PT-1 also did not inhibit the binding of specific anti-CXCR4 and anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to MT4 cells (data now shown), suggesting that PT-1 did not interact with any of the co-receptors.",

HPA-23, known as antimonium tungstate, was one of the first-generation POM and the only one of all studied POMs so far that progressed to clinical trials. However, it caused adverse effects on the hepatic and renal functions [36]. POMs still suffer from the stigma of this failure, although new generations of POMs including Keggin structures, have been synthesized with less toxicity and greater efficacy, most studies have focused on cancer therapy [37,38], and very few studies have been conducted to investigate the anti-HIV potential in the past decade [39]. The mechanism of action has remained unclear. In the present work, we evaluated the potency and mechanism of action of a Keggin POM, PT-1 (K6HPTi2W10O40) in preventing HIV-1 entry and replication. We demonstrated that PT-1 inhibited replication of multiple virus strains with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. In addition to its remarkable high potency, it revealed low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. The high therapeutic index (TI) makes PT-1 a good candidate for HIV-1 treatment.",

PT-1 exhibited a certain degree of inhibition on RT and integrase, but not protease. We also observed that the RT inhibition percentage was not comparable to the HIV-1 inhibition percentage, indicating that the anti-HIV-1 activity was not fully mediated via inhibition of RT or integrase activity. To learn more about which steps of the HIV-1 cycle were targeted by PT-1, we conducted a time-drug-addition assay to have a thorough investigation of possible targets of the HIV-1 life-cycle.

The first step in the HIV-1 entry into the host cells involves the binding of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein to the CD4 on the target cell membrane. Previous studies revealed that POMs were effective in blocking viral absorption by interacting with the gp120 glycoprotein [41]. In our assays, PT-1 did not directly bind to gp120 in the SPR assay, however, it competed with CD4 for binding to gp120. The CD4 receptor is a monomeric protein composed of four immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains (D1-D4). Numerous mutagenesis tests indicated that the D1 domain (complementarity-determining region (CDR2, region 21\u201364) is critical for gp120 binding and can be blocked by anti-CD4 antibody [42,43]. We thus used anti-CD4 RPA-T4 antibody (binds to D1 domain) to analyze the interaction of PT-1 and CD4 on the cell membrane. The FACS analysis confirmed the direct binding of PT-1 to the D1 domain of the CD4 receptor. When gp120 interacted with CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4 or CCR5, the gp41 transmembrane subunit experiences conformational changes, and the N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR) of gp41 associate with the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) to form a thermostable, six-helix bundle (6-HB) core. The NHR and CHR domains are critical for the membrane fusion. NHR and CHR derived protein, such as N36 and C34, blocked gp41 core formation by interacting with CHR and NHR, respectively, and served as important targets for HIV fusion inhibitors [44]. In our study, PT-1 interfered with gp41 formation by binding to an NHR peptide. The KD value of PT-1 binding to N36 was close to the IC50 obtained in the cell-based assay, suggesting that PT-1 inhibited HIV-1 entry by interfering with NHR and disrupting gp41 six helix bundle formation.",

Despite the fact that it reduces the viral load to an undetectable level and has greatly improved survival rates and life quality of HIV-infected patients, it still faces challenges including long-term drug resistance, unwanted drug-drug interactions and low compliance of patients. Thus, the discovery of multifunctional agents that interact simultaneously with more than one target has proven effective in anti-HIV leads discovery. For instance, inducible T cell kinase (ITK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors blocked multi-steps of HIV replication, including viral entry, reverse transcription, integration, and viral particle production [45,46]. Many plant-derived polyphenols such as quercetin, isoflavones, flavanones and phenolic acid derivatives, showed activity against various viral enzyme targets simultaneously [47]. Importantly, HIV protease inhibitors were found not only affecting virion release, but also blocking viral entry, reverse transcription and post\u2013reverse transcription [48]. In the present study, we have identified the multi-target profile of PT-1, which not only blocked viral entry, but also interfered with main HIV enzymes reverse transcriptase and integrase In addition, POMs could be easily modified by various chemical reactions to enhance the specificity or activity, and they are less expensive than organic agents. We synthesized a serial of POMs derivatives by decorating PT-1 with amino acid to improve biocompatibility, and the modifications did not affect anti-viral activity. Thus, PT-1 has shown some promising properties for drug development. It is also important to note that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profile of most metal-based compounds have yet to be identified and warrant further investigation.",

The data suggested that PT-1 functioned during an early stage of infection, partially by directly interacting with the gp41 NHR and blocking the gp120-binding domain of the CD4 receptor. These findings suggest that PT-1 may be a promising drug candidate for the treatment of HIV-1.",
