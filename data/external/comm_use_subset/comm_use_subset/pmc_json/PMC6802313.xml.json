            "text": "Commercial poultry in Pakistan was established in the early 1960s, representing one of the largest agriculture-based segments of Pakistan\u2019s economy with a significant contribution to national gross domestic product (1.3%) [1]. There are over 25,000 poultry farms spread across the country\u2019s rural areas and the Pakistan poultry industry produces around 1220 million kg of chicken meat and 10,000 million eggs a year [2]. In the past, regional studies on poultry disease surveillance and clinical surveys have been conducted to better understand the disease distribution pattern in different regions of Pakistan [3\u20135]. Recently, outbreaks of viral diseases with high morbidity and mortality were being reported consistently [6\u20138] and are possibly due to the intensification of commercial poultry production and lack of biosecurity measures. Pakistan\u2019s poultry industry has indeed been growing continuously, facilitating the spread of multiple common viral respiratory diseases (CVRDs) such as Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bronchitis (IB), swollen head syndrome (SHS), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) infections, which are caused by Avian Avulavirus 1 (AAVV-1), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and avian influenza virus (AIV), respectively. These are highly contagious diseases of poultry, with worldwide distribution and they have serious economic impacts on the poultry industry. The causative agents of these diseases affect chickens of all ages except ILTV, which normally does not affect chickens before 3 weeks of age. These pathogens may interact with bacterial agents resulting in high morbidity and mortality in the infected chickens [9]. The continuous emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epidemics and the frequent changes observed in the genomic sequence of these viruses lead to ineffective diagnostics and control measures. Outbreaks of CVRDs such as IB and SHS are not reported to the country\u2019s ministry in charge of livestock and poultry production. Consequently, the distribution patterns of such chicken diseases are unclear in Pakistan [3]. Moreover, CVRDs, such as LPAI (H9N2), are of great significance to public health due to their zoonotic potential [10\u201312]. Therefore, it is important to investigate the distribution pattern of CVRDs in different regions and different chicken production types to develop scientific and risk-based prevention measures of these poultry diseases.",

No ILTV positive sample was detected in our study (Fig. 1). Co-infections were common for AIV and AAVV-1 (9 AIV/ AAVV-1 co-infected flocks) but less common for the other avian viruses of interest (Table 1). Briefly, 9 flocks (6, 21, 23, 38, 41, 42, 66, 67, 68) were found positive for AIV (H9) and AAVV-1 coinfections. AAVV-1 + aMPV, AIV + aMPV and AAVV-1 + IBV coinfections were detected only in flock number 69, 70 and 80, respectively. There was no observed difference in the likelihood of co-infection between production types.\n\n",

Unfortunately, the method used to collect samples did not allow the isolation of the viruses. This resulted in limited nucleic acid quantities that did not allow for the amplification of more than the HA2 part of the genome. Similarly, only partial gene sequences were obtained for AAVV-1, IBV, and aMPV. Regardless, the circulating subtypes/genotypes of chicken viruses in Pakistan were as follows: genotype VII AAVV-1 (VIIi), GI-13 (793B) IBV and genotype B aMPV, with no difference from the summer of 2014 through to January 2016.",

At least two classes and 18 genotypes of AAVV-1 have been described. Despite the use of imported vaccines, AAVV-1 still remains the main poultry disease in both commercial and rural chickens flocks of Pakistan [15]. Recently, AAVV-1 s of genotype VI, VII and XIII were detected in Pakistani poultry [16\u201323] and genotype VII is predominant across the country. Similarly, Miller et al. [24] reported that viruses of sub-genotype VIIi have replaced AAVV-1 isolates of genotype XIII in Pakistan, which were commonly isolated since 2009\u20132011. The viruses of genotype VII had a high genetic diversity as compared to isolates from genotypes VI and XIII and, therefore, have more potential to evolve over a period of time [25].

There has been so far no genomic characterization of IB viruses circulating in Pakistan, but there is serological evidence of the pathogen. Ahmed et al. [25] showed seroprevalences of IBV strains M-41 (88%), D-274 (40%), D-1466 (52%), and 4\u201391 (8%) in Pakistani poultry. Massachusetts strains (such as M41) are mainly used as vaccines in the field in Pakistan but we cannot totally rule out the use of 4\u201391 vaccines due to the limited control of imported vaccines. Similarly, high prevalence of IBV in backyard poultry (74%) and commercial poultry of Bangladesh (57%) were reported [26]. Sumi et al. [27] classified Indian IBV isolates based on phylogenetic analysis within the Mass genotype (India/LKW/56/IVRI/08, now called GI-1) and the 793/B genotype (or 4\u201391 genotype, India/NMK/72/IVRI/10, now called GI-13). Moreover, IBV viruses of genotype 793/B-like (GI-13) and QX-like (GI-19) have been reported recently in poultry of Iran and Iraq [28, 29]. Considering the geographic proximity of the 5 countries and the commercial exchanges, it is not surprising that 793/B (GI-13) strains were detected in Pakistan.",

The AAVV-1 vaccines used in Pakistan are the LaSota (genotype II) and R2B (mesogenic Mukteswar strain, genotype III) strains. Field AAVV-1 detected in the present study (genotype VII) were therefore not vaccine viruses. The LaSota vaccine is formulated from a lentogenic (low virulence) clone of the LaSota strain and is manufactured in different countries around the world. The vaccine is imported to Pakistan and administered to commercial poultry flocks. In contrast, the R2B strain is manufactured by local vaccine companies and administered to backyard poultry. It is still unknown whether these vaccine strains (genotypes II and III viruses) can elicit a protective immune response against the prevailing field strains, especially genotype VII viruses: the protection should be evaluated in experimental and field conditions. Furthermore, the inability of live vaccines to elicit a protective immune response might be due to an inadequate cold chain supply system, inappropriate route of vaccination, or incorrect vaccination schedules. It has been reported that the currently applied AAVV-1 vaccines give better protection against the velogenic AAVV-1 s isolated from the 1930s through to the 1970s (Herts33/56, California 71) than those more recently isolated [38]. Hence parameters for selection of vaccine strains need to be reconsidered. Likewise, the optimization of vaccination schedules according to local climate and environmental conditions should be investigated.",

In total, 161 samples were collected. Sampling areas were chosen based on poultry population size: the selected sampling area is Pakistan\u2019s main poultry producing region (with more than 50% of the country\u2019s poultry farms, [42, 43], (Dr. Umar and Bin Aslam, personal communications). Farms were selected based on reports of clinical respiratory signs from the farmers to their veterinarians. The reported clinical signs were as follows (at least 2 signs needed to be included in the study): mortality, and/or drop in egg production, and/or drop in feed and water consumption, and/or nasal/eye discharge, and/or labored breathing, and/or gasping. Birds were sampled by trained personnel (a veterinarian with the help of the farmers who were trained on this occasion on how to swab birds) and flocks were excluded when the onset of clinical signs was observed more than 4 days prior to the visit. Farms were sampled once only (no repeated sampling). Oropharyngeal swabs or tissue impression smears (trachea, lungs) from birds showing respiratory signs were blotted onto Finders Technology Associates (FTA\u00ae) sampling cards (Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ). The FTA cards were allowed to air dry and were stored at 4 \u00b0C until further processing. Age, flock size and health status are summarized in Table 1. For each flock, 1 or 2 FTA cards were used, and 10 swabs were blotted on each FTA card at the farm (one sample number refers to a pool of 10 swabs from symptomatic birds in a given flock, Table 1) to detect a prevalence of \u22650.14 to \u22650.28% for each virus per flock (for flocks of 2500 to 10,000 birds with a 95% confidence level). According to the farmers\u2019 information, some of the farms had been vaccinated against ND, infectious bursal disease and/or IB, but none of the farms visited had been vaccinated against aMPV or ILTV (Table 1).",

Additionally, the software was used to read the sequencing electrophoregrams and to exclude nucleotide ambiguity. To ensure the reliability of sequences, forward and reverse sequences were aligned with ClustalW [45]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the maximum likelihood method, the Tamura-Nei model (gamma distributed), with 500 bootstrap replicates and pairwise deletion using MEGA software Version 6.06 [46]. For reference, bootstrap values above 50 were labelled on major tree branches. The nucleotide sequences of partial segments of the S1, G, HA, and F genes of IBV, aMPV, AIV and AAVV-1, respectively, were compared with the first 10 blast hit sequences and reference sequences of the same genes from GenBank. Recent classifications for IBV genotypes were used [47].",
