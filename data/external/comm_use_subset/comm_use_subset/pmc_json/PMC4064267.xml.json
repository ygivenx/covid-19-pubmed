For estimating ML- maximum likelihood values, a user-specified topology was used. The maximum log likelihood for this computation was \u22121680.662 and \u22122731.225. Codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 702 positions in the final dataset.

This RT-PCR methodology had been previously proved to be sensitive and specific for PToV [25]. RT-PCR displayed that PToV infections were widespread in large-scale breeding bases and on rural farms in Sichuan. The overall positive rate was 37.96%, and six districts, Suining, Deyang, Yibin, Chengdu, Mianyang and Meishan, had higher infection rates than this. These results may be due to the increased urban agglomeration and greater levels of prosperity within these districts leading to greater movement of, and poorer storage and feeding of livestock with in these areas. According to the PToV infection rates at different growth stages, piglets of 1 to 3 weeks of age were more vulnerable to PToV than the others. Nonetheless, the result is likely to be an incomplete reflection the total number of infections in Sichuan province. The reason for this is that the highest prevalence and greatest anti-PToV Ig G titers were observed in adults [17]. In contrast, the lowest prevalence and lowest anti-PToV Ig G levels were found among 3-week-old piglets [17]. Both ELISA reactivity values and rates of seroprevalence rose markedly in piglets from 3 to 11 weeks [17]. These results suggested that RT-PCR cannot reflect the infections completely due to swine developing their own immune response to the virus resulting in an effective cure in some infected adults. Consequently, further immunological methods should be established to develop a more robust serological surveillance of PToV.",

Since the relationship between PToV infection and diarrhea remains unclear, the virus is still a potential threat for us. Further studies to reveal the epidemiological status of PToV infection in China are essential, and the research should focus on the epidemiology and pathogenic potential of PoTV.
