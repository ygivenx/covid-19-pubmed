            "text": "\nHadjelia truncata (Creplin, 1825) is a nematode from the family Habronematidae that lives in the gizzard of a number of birds in Europe and Asia; including pigeon (Columbia livia domestica) and hoopoe (Upupa epops) (1\u20133). It causes lesions in the gizzard lining of pigeons, which may even lead to death. It has an indirect life cycle and some species of insects has been reported to serve as intermediate hosts; in the hemocoel of which the infectious stage (L3) develops. Chabaud reported development of the nematode's larval stages in the haemocoel of the beetles, Asida jurinei, A. sericea and Phylan abbreviates (3, 4). The lesser mealworms, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), also known as the darkling beetles or litter beetles are common cosmopolitan pests in poultry houses (5, 6, 7). Both adults and larvae are scavengers (8), consuming chicken food, feces, and dead birds, and sometimes attacking live birds (9, 10). Darkling beetles are important vectors of a number of poultry pathogenic agents. These include some viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (11\u201318). The beetle can serve as an intermediate host for helminths such as fowl cestode, Choanotaenia infundibulum, other chicken tapeworms (19), and the nematode, Subulura brumpti\n(20). Culturing lesser mealworms in the laboratory is needed to produce adult beetle for experimental studies. Different culture methods have been described earlier (21, 22).",

Antennae are densely clothed with short yellowish hairs, with the terminal segment lighter in color. The head is deeply emarginated in front, has a distinct clypeal groove, and the surface is coarsely punctured. Eyes are emarginated approximately one-half the length of eye, and prosternal process is horizontal between forecoxae (23, 24). Average length and width of the collected adult beetles were 6.31 mm (5.54 to 6.96mm) and 2.88 mm (2.50 to 3.20 mm) respectively.

The only investigation on natural infection of A. diaperinus to H. truncata encysted larvae was carried out by Geyhan, M. E (2004) in Assiut Governorate of Egypt; which as far as we know is not published (30). In this work, 19.91% of beetles (1170 beetles were dissected) were naturally infected with the encysted larvae. Natural infection rate of the beetles with the nematode larvae in our study was higher in comparison to the mentioned study. The reason of this difference could be mainly higher infection intensity of the pigeons to the adult nematodes. Overall, both researches especially the experimental infection confirmed natural potential of the beetles to act as an intermediate host for the nematode H. truncata.",

At about 18-20 \u00b0C the first moult took place in the insect in 25 days and the second in 50 days. Growth was most marked after 35 days (from 1.8 to 4.0 mm). In our study, collected third stage larvae were morphologically similar to what described by Chabaud; as they had large pseudolabia and a divided esophagus and that their tail ended in a peculiar unarmed button-like appendage; but the average length of larvae was more than what had been achieved by Chabaud. Comparison between the two results indicates that growth of the larvae in the beetles continues even after 35-50 days.",

It is not clear if the infective stage of the nematode can be produced in larvae of the beetles. Karunamoorthy et al.

It seems that starvation and unavailability of proper food (grains, seeds) forces them to eat the infected beetles in the bird droppings. Infection rate in naturally infected beetles with nematode larvae were more than those experimentally infected; which is probably because of the adult beetle life span and high probability of repeated infection, as the adult beetles are long lived and normally persisting for more than a year (19). It appears to be important in potential long time transmission of pathogenic agents. In addition, climatic condition of the region (Khuzestan) is relatively suitable for growth of the beetles; since the lesser mealworm is well suited for warm and humid conditions. This situation also exists in poultry or brooder houses (6). However, there is no published report of the beetle in pigeon or poultry houses in Ahvaz and not in Iran. The beetle has been reported in pigeon houses in the Sudan (37). Development of the nematode larvae in the beetles does not have apparent and serious effects on them. The length range of the beetles was slightly greater than those of reported by other investigators (24); which was possibly related to geographical differences.",
