C. difficile infection (CDI) causes 10\u201320% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, 75% of antibiotic-associated colitis, and nearly 100% of pseudomembranous colitis in hospitals (referred to as C. difficile-associated diseases, CDADs), leading to billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide every year [1]. In general, CDADs occur mainly in people with long-term use of antibiotics, the use of anticancer drugs, long-term hospitalization or immune defects, especially those with a decline in immune function or the elderly [1]. With the development of medical industry and the increasing use of antibiotics, the rate of CDI has been substantially increased in China [2]. Effective strategies are urgently needed for CDI prevention in the high-risk population of CDADs.",

Vaccine development involves the establishment of an appropriate animal model and further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. In previous research of C. difficile vaccines, Kink et al.[3] successfully established CDI model in hamster by intragastric gavage of 105CFU C. difficile 18\u201324 h after subcutaneous injection of clindamycin (CLDM, 1 mg per 100 g body weight), and Torres et al. [4] administered the animals with 105CFU C. difficile 3-h after CLDM gavage (0.5 mg per 100 g body weight). In general, golden hamster is considered ideal for establishing CDI model, because C. difficile-produced toxins can be neutralized by anti-C. difficile antibodies and CLDM-induced colitis model can be used as animal model of human CDIs.",

For example, Torres et al.[4] reported that formalin-inactivated C. difficile culture filtrate has a protective effect on hamsters by nasal, peritoneal, or subcutaneous administration. Ryan et al.[5] and Ward et al.[6] developed recombinant vaccines for C. difficile by engineering a plasmid to express recombinant toxin A proteins from the nontoxic C-terminal receptor binding region of C. difficile toxin A (TcdA) covalently bonded to polysaccharide of other bacterium, and then introducing this plasmid into attenuated Salmonella typhimuriu or Vibrio cholerae. However, the application of previously developed vaccines for C. difficile has been limited for various reasons: 1) Vaccines for passive immunization of CDI are thought expensive and inconvenient in storage and transport; 2) Attenuated vaccines are commonly treated with formalin to inactivate the antigen or given with adjuvant, sometimes through invasive routes of immunization such as subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection, thus are not easily accepted by the patients. 3) Recombinant vaccines that are carried by attenuated S. typhimuriu or V. cholerae are of concern in terms of biosafety [1].",

            "text": "Lactococcus lactis is a harmless food industry bacterium that has been used extensively for producing a variety of peptides, proteins, and oral vaccines. As compared to the vaccine carrier E. coli, L. lactis can be a superior alternative because it produces less protease with no endotoxin [7]. In the literature, Dieye et al. [8] designed a protein-targeting system for lactic acid bacteria and found that the L. lactis expression system constructed with the P59 promoter and Usp45 single peptide (SPUsp45) was capable of expression and extracellular secretion of target nuclease while the expression system constructed with P59, Usp45, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6 (cwaM6) was capable of extracellular secretion of the nuclease as well as anchoring it onto the cell wall of L. lactis and Bacterium lacticum. In a following study, Ribeiro et al.[9] expressed a fusion protein containing the Brucella abortus antigen L7/L12 and the Streptococcus pyogenes cwaM6 in L. lactis, which allowed the antigen anchored on the cell surface, thus improving its antigenicity. These authors further developed a food-grade live vaccine for immunization of B. abortus, which showed a protective effect on mice under laboratory conditions [9]. In addition, Mannam et al.[10] made a mucosal vaccine from live, recombinant L. lactis, which protected mice against pharyngeal infection with S. pyogenes. Together these researches have provided a completely new direction for development of vaccines, especially live probiotic preparations for oral immunization.",

These observations can be related to previous work by Vaerman et al.[20], which indicates that the IgG antibody in serum and intestinal fluid plays a significant role in protecting human and experimental animals from CDI, and that IgA plays aminor role in prevention and control of CDIs. In the present study, none of the animals died in secreted-protein plasmid group after the C. difficile challenge. In fact, their diarrhea symptoms were relatively light (Table 4). This is because TcdA acts an enterotoxin as well as a cytotoxin, with a lower cytotoxicity than the C. difficile toxin B [19].

Pathological analysis and flow cytometry assay confirmed that oral immunization with the recombinant L. lactis carrying membrane-anchored plasmid most effectively prevented C. difficile-induced diarrhea in the animal model as well as apoptosis in the intestinal epithelial cells (Figures 3, 4, 5, and 9). Compared to other immunization groups, membrane-anchored plasmid group had higher tilter of anti-TcdA IgG antibody in the serum and intestinal fluid (Figure 7), with downregulated expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 (Figure 10). It was possible that the number of exogenous L. lactis cells in vivo gradually decreased due to phagocytosis by the M cells on the intestinal wall. Because membrane-anchored plasmid anchors the recombinant protein onto the cell wall, phagocytosis of L. lactis cells carrying such plasmid can more efficiently deliver the antigen to the immune system than that of secreted-protein plasmid. Consequently, the recombinant L. lactis carrying membrane-anchored plasmid is most effective for preventing CDI compared to other immunization treatments. Further investigation is guaranteed to explore molecular mechanism(s) of CDI prevention by the recombinant L. lactis live vaccine.",
