            "text": "Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory respiratory disease that affects 300 million people of all ages and all ethnic backgrounds and accounts for about 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide [1]. In Taiwan, the prevalence of asthma increased from 5.07% in 1985 to 11.9% in 2007 [2], [3]. The risk factors for asthma include many external determinants such as mites, dust, mold, indoor and outdoor air pollution, and season variations [4]\u2013[6]. Although air pollution has not been shown as the sole cause of respiratory illnesses, there is evidence that air pollution episodes lead to respiratory irritation, increased use of asthma medications and hospitalizations [7], [8]. Traffic and industry-related pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), were associated with asthma hospitalizations and outpatient visits [9], [10]. Elevated levels of ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u226610\u00b5m (PM10) were reported to be related with increased asthma emergency room visits and admissions [11]\u2013[13]. It has been reported that the rise in air pollution has increased respiratory and cardiovascular complications leading to elevated risk of death [14].",

Daily counts of clinic visits, outpatient visits, ED visits and hospital admissions for asthma were extracted from the medical insurance file for the period of 2000\u20132009. The outpatient visit was defined as a patient visit to a physician's office, clinic, or hospital outpatient department. The inpatient visits include ED visits and admissions. The analyses covered 54 municipalities, each with its own air quality monitoring station. We identified 306628 men and 315178 women who lived in municipalities with air quality monitoring stations during the study period. There were 33934 men and 34527 women with asthma. The patient's exact addresses were not available from the database. Therefore, we assumed that the municipality where a patient visit occurred was regarded as the same area where the patient was most likely exposed to air pollutants. Each asthma outpatient or inpatient visit was matched with the municipality's seasonal average pollutant concentrations. Each occurrence, limited to municipality with air quality monitoring stations, was counted as one visit. The outpatient and inpatient visits were further analyzed by seasons (spring as February, March and April; summer as May, June and July; autumn as August, September and October; winter as November, December and January) and four age groups (0\u201318, 19\u201344, 45\u201364 and \u226565 years).",

As multiple visits by the same patient in a season in the municipality who lived, the count of the visits was as one visit per season.

Little is known about changes over time in air pollutant exposure among patients with asthma in a national sample. During the study period, the inpatient and outpatient visits by men were higher than in women. The peak seasons of asthma inpatient and outpatient visits for the total population were spring and winter, respectively. The inpatient and outpatient visits of asthmatics have not reached a plateau and have continued to increase. Inpatient visits for asthma increased with increased levels of CO in children but not for any pollutants in adults in the present study. Our study found that CO, NO2 and PM10 had significant estimated associations on outpatient visits due to asthma and children are more susceptible than other age groups.",

Our study used the count of health care visits from NHRI databases as the measure of morbidity in the population. Clinic visits, outpatient visits, ED visits and admissions are types of health care service, but also possessed of potentially important disparities [17], [18]. Because asthma is a chronic disease, patients with asthma were taught to deal with their symptoms and discomfort of an asthma attack [19], [20]. When the concentrations of air pollutants rise, patients with asthma may have treated symptoms by themselves or visited neighborhood clinics and hospital outpatient departments for medical treatment. Subsequently, if patients did not receive any treatment or if the condition was deteriorated or ineffective after an outpatient visit, they would then visit hospital emergency departments for assistance. This may explain why there was no increased risk for inpatient visits for adults with increasing levels of air pollutants.",

The characteristics of the program were registry development, adherence to guidelines, patient education, and nursing care management. The Bureau offered financial incentives that motivated the nurses and physicians to change their practice patterns by following clinical guidelines; thereby, the asthma care team support from healthcare organizations was able to promote and enable patients to effectively self-manage their asthma with reduced healthcare resource utilization. During the SARS outbreak, people avoided hospital visits to prevent themselves from nasocomial infection and the inpatient visit rate for asthma decreased in all age groups [22]. However, there was an increase of inpatient and outpatient visits after the SARS outbreak. The exacerbation of air pollution probably plays a role in the rising rate of asthma visits due to growing populations, increased economic activity, rise in vehicular traffic, as well as the increasing intensity and occurrence of dust storms originating in Mongolia and China [23].",

            "text": "There have been associations between daily ambient air pollution levels and acute exacerbations of respiratory diseases in many time-series studies [11], [12], [24]. Urban air pollution constitutes a complex mixture of several compounds. The exposure of motor vehicle air pollutants, such as NO2, CO, SO2 and PM, increases the incidence and prevalence of asthma and bronchitic symptoms [25]. CO was reported to be associated with asthma admission and ED visits [9], [26], [27]. There were associations between short-term exposure to ambient CO and risk of cardiovascular disease hospitalizations, even at low ambient CO levels [28]. Sun et al conducted a one-year observation in central Taiwan that CO played a role in acute exacerbation of asthma in children and increased the number of childhood asthma ED visits, but not in adults [29]. Villeneuve et al reported that an increase in the interquartile range of the 5-day average for CO was associated with 48% increases in the risk of an asthma ED visit for children aged 2 to 4, but the associations were less pronounced in adult aged 15 to 44 [30]. In Rome, where air pollution comes mostly from combustion products of motor vehicles, CO was associated with most of the respiratory conditions in all ages, and it remained an independent predictor in multi-pollutant analysis for all respiratory admissions [31]. In London, there were significant associations between CO and daily consultations for asthma and other lower respiratory disease in children, whereas in adults the only consistent association was with PM10\n[32]. In our study, CO was also significantly associated with asthma exacerbation and inpatient visits in children. However, a direct association between CO and asthma lacks a biologically plausible mechanism [33]. It is possible that CO might be a surrogate for other noxious incomplete combustion products [34]. Unlike with children, the other major confounders in adult asthmatic patients include occupational exposures, smoking, stress, emotional factors, and systemic diseases, which may also partly explain why outdoor air pollution was not associated with inpatient visits in the adults in our study.",

In our study, levels of PM10 were associated with outpatient visits for asthma, but not associated with admissions. Hwang and Chan used data obtained from clinic records and environmental monitoring stations in Taiwan and reported that PM10 had an impact on outpatient visits [43]. This was consistent with our findings.",

We conducted a nationwide asthma survey on the effects of air pollution in Taiwan and evaluated the association between different air pollutants and outpatient and inpatient visits. One of the strengths of the present study is the use of a computerized database, which is population-based and is highly representative. Because we enrolled all patients diagnosed with asthma from 2000 to 2009, we can rule out the possibility of selection bias. Since the data were obtained from a historical database, which collects all information, recall bias was avoided. Besides, we analyzed levels of pollutants at different municipalities and compared whether the inpatient and outpatient visits in those municipalities correlated with levels of pollutants. Thus this study directly associated the patient visits with the levels of pollutants in those municipalities. As multiple visits by the same patient would lead to misinterpretation of the data, we used the statistic method to reduce bias.",

First, although we adjusted for several potential confounders in the statistical analysis, a number of possible confounding variables, including family history of atopy, dietary habits, physical activity, occupational exposures, smoking habits, stress and emotional factors, which are associated with asthma were not included in our database. Second, we were unable to ask patients for severity of asthma because of de-identifcation. Third, self-treatment with over-the-counter medications or alternative health services was not included in the database. These data also do not include the number of asthmatic subjects who had respiratory problems but did not search for health service. Therefore, the extent of the issue may have been considerably underestimated. Fourth, potentially inaccurate data in the records could lead to possible mis-classification.",
