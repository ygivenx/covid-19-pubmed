            "text": "Protein Never in Mitosis Gene A Interacting-1 (PIN1) is an enzyme that regulates transcription, and turnover of mRNA and proteins. PIN1 is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that contains an amino-terminal domain, the tryptophan-tryptophan (WW) domain, which is characterized by two tryptophan residues separated by 22 amino acids that can bind to phosphorylated serine- or threonine-proline sequences in substrate proteins. PIN1 also isomerizes this motif with its carboxy-terminal catalytic domain [1]. Isomerization of the phosphorylated serine- or threonine-proline motif has a significant effect on conformation of many phospho-proteins. The conformational switching catalyzed by PIN1 allows it to regulate transcription factors, mRNA stabilization factors, and the susceptibility of a growing list of proteins to post-translational modifications and proteases [1-5].",

Despite a nearly 5-fold greater induction of COX-2 protein in KD compared with Control MAEC, there was no difference in the induction of COX-2 mRNA (figure 3). This suggests that PIN1 regulates COX-2 by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Consistent with a post-transcriptional effect, PIN1 depletion reduced the turnover of COX-2 (figure 6).

In contrast, cathepsin activity was not affected by PIN1 depletion (figure 8). This result, combined with the effects of zVF and PD150606 on COX-2 induction and turnover, suggests again that calpain limits the expression of COX-2 in MAEC. Indeed, COX-2 was degraded by \u03bc-calpain in vitro, indicating that it is a potential substrate in cells (figure 7). The reduced calpain activity in KD extracts (figure 8) could be due to an increase in expression or function of calpastatin or other unrecognized endogenous calpain inhibitors in KD cells, or to a reduction in expression or function of calpains [39]. Nevertheless, the results suggest that PIN1 depletion reduces calpain activity, consequently reducing the turnover of COX-2 in MAEC.",

The partially reduced calpain activity could account for the intermediate loss of COX-2 in the cycloheximide-treated KD cells, allowing zVF to further suppress turnover. It may also explain the ability of calpain inhibitors to increase induction of COX-2 in both KD and Control MAEC (figure 4).

The WW and catalytic domains of PIN1 appeared to contribute to the association [6]. This suggested that PIN1 depletion might alter the susceptibility of its targets to digestion by calpain. For example, PIN1 could associate with these substrates and catalyze proline isomerization, affecting protease sensitivity. In contrast to iNOS, however, interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 was not detected here. A role for direct interaction between COX-2 and PIN1 cannot be completely excluded, however, since association of the proline isomerase with its putative substrate may be weak or transient. PIN1 could also affect association of COX-2, or iNOS, with other proteins that may indirectly regulate proteolysis. Thus, effects of PIN1 on calpain activity and/or COX-2, or associated factors, could affect the sensitivity of COX-2 to digestion with calpain.",

Thus, it remains to be determined whether PIN1 or specific calpains in endothelial cells can be exploited to manipulate inflammatory activation in a therapeutically useful manner.
