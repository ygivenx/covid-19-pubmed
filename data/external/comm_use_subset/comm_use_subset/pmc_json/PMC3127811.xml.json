Proteins rarely act alone but rather interact with other proteins and comprise specific functional modules in the network [7]. Functional module is a group of proteins which are related by one or more cellular and genetic interactions such as co-regulation, co-expression, and the member of a biological pathway or a protein complex [8]. Such module is the building block of cellular organization and carries out unique biological process [9]. Therefore, understanding the modular structure of protein functional network should be useful for characterizing the dynamic organization of cellular systems.",

Although mitochondria possess their own DNA, it is estimated that at least 98% of the 1,500\u20132,000 mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and shuttled posttranslationally into the mitochondria [11], [12]. In addition, the majority of human mt disorders are known to be related with nuclear genome defects [13]. Thus, compiling a comprehensive list of mt proteins is essential to understand mitochondrial biogenesis and pathology. Large-scale approaches such as mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics [14], epitope tagging combined with microscopy [15], genome-wide predictions of protein subcellular localizations [16], and comparative genomics analyses [17], [18], [19] have revealed the localization of the mt protein inventory.",

For example, the compositions of mt proteins are different across various tissues and organs in mice [21], [22] and changed by fermentation states in yeast [18] or environmental stresses in plants [23]. Additionally, in humans, dynamic changes in the mt proteome affect the functional organizations of mt proteins and disease susceptibilities [24]. Genetic or biochemical abnormalities in mitochondria caused by complete or partial mtDNA depletion have been linked to a wide range of human diseases including metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative disorders, mitochondrial myopathy, and cancer [12], [25]. We have previously reported that mtDNA depletion can lead to impairments of glucose metabolism [26], insulin signaling [27], and apoptosis [28].

Our results revealed that human mt proteins comprise specific network modules to control unique biological processes in cells exposed to dysfunctional mt states. Furthermore, network clustering suggests that cells respond to pathological conditions by modulating the coordinated expression and transport of mitochondrial proteins.

The \u03c10 cell was established by long-term treatment of ethidium bromide (EtBr) which intercalated into mtDNA without any detectable effect on nuclear DNA division [30] and led to the inhibition of mtDNA replication and transcription [31]. Thus, we examined a set of nuclear-encoded mt proteins as mt proteome. To quantify protein abundance ratios of mt proteins in \u03c10 versus \u03c1+ mitochondria, we labeled mt proteins with cICAT containing light (12C) and heavy (13C) isotope signatures, which react with thiol groups of cysteines in proteins. The experimental scheme is summarized in Figure S1 (see Materials and Methods for details). From the cICAT analysis, we identified 1,121 proteins (Table S1). According to the mt protein abundance ratios (\u03c10/\u03c1+), we classified all proteins into three classes: up-regulated, down-regulated, and not significantly changed proteins in \u03c10 mitochondria. The number of up-regulated proteins with \u03c10/\u03c1+\u22651.5 was 201, while the number of down-regulated proteins with \u03c10/\u03c1+\u22640.67 was 313.The thresholds of 1.5 represents the 1.5-fold increase, whereas the threshold of 0.67 represents 1.5-fold decrease under dysfunctional \u03c10 state. Meanwhile, 607 not significantly changed proteins were present in both \u03c10 and \u03c1+ mitochondria with similar abundances (0.67<\u03c10/\u03c1+<1.5).",

First, we examined the Gene Ontology (GO) cellular component annotation for the identified proteins and compiled 13 reference mt protein datasets from seven mt proteins databases and six mt proteomics datasets (see Materials and Methods for details). In total, 569 out of 1,121 proteins (50.76%) were annotated as mitochondrial proteins and observed from at least one reference mt protein dataset (Figure 1B). Then, we assessed the physical and functional links of reference mt proteins based on the assumption that protein pairs that interact or share similar functions tend to cluster within the same subcellular organelle [15]. A total of 201 proteins were physically (82 proteins, 7.31%) or functionally (119 proteins, 10.62%) linked to the 569 reference mt proteins (Figure 1B). Physical link represents protein-protein interaction. Meanwhile, functional link represents a relationship between two proteins if they shared a substrate in a metabolic pathway, co-expressed, co-regulated, or involved in the same protein complex. We listed these 770 mt proteins (569+82+119) in Table S1 as a reliable mt protein dataset. Among the 770 mt proteins, the numbers of down-regulated, up-regulated, and not significantly changed proteins were 288, 122, and 360, respectively (Figure 1C). The remaining proteins (351 proteins, 31.31%) were assigned as non-referenced mt proteins that might be either novel mt proteins or proteins with localizations that were affected by mtDNA depletion.",

To analyze the systemic properties of the mt proteome under the dysfunctional \u03c10 state, we constructed a network of reliable mt proteins. By using information about the physical and functional links of these proteins, we could map 726 out of 770 reliable mt proteins into a major network (right panel in Figure 1A; see Materials and Methods for details). The remaining 44 proteins disconnected from the major network were excluded from further network analysis. We discovered that the network is divided into two prominent subnetworks of up-regulated (green) and down-regulated proteins (red) based on abundance ratios (Figure 2A). Interestingly, more links were made within up-regulated or down-regulated proteins (intraregulatory links) than between up- and down-regulated proteins (interregulatory links). Among the 5,713 links in the network, the majority (4,854 links, 84.96%) were intraregulatory links (Figure 2B). When we measured the fraction of links per protein, intraregulatory links were 3-fold more common than interregulatory links (Whitney-Mann U test, p-value = 7.55\u00d710\u221278; Figure 2C). Furthermore, the shortest path length of proteins connected within intraregulatory links was smaller than that of proteins connected within interregulatory links (Whitney-Mann U test, p-value = 7.55\u00d710\u2212156; Figure 2D). Shortest path length is the minimum number of links connecting one protein to another protein in the network, thus a smaller shortest path length implies that two proteins are more closely related [6]. This result indicates that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins tend to cluster themselves and might have distinct functional roles in the protein functional network.",

We used hierarchical average-linkage clustering with the STRING confidence scores as a similarity measure (Materials and Methods for details). Then, we assigned the biological function to the module by examining the representative functional annotations from proteins in each module. Finally, we identified 13 functional modules that were enriched either within up-regulated or down-regulated protein groups (p-value <0.01; Table S3). As shown in Figure 3A, five functional groups were up-regulated (shown in green boxes), whereas eight functional groups were down-regulated (shown in red boxes) under the dysfunctional \u03c10 state. The five up-regulated groups contain 59 out of 89 (66.29%) up-regulated proteins. They are linked to the function of cytosolic ribosome, ribonucleoprotein complex, protein folding on mt surface, DNA repair, and proteolysis, which are associated with the regulation of mt protein expression in response to mtDNA damage (Figure 3B). Conversely, the eight down-regulated groups include 138 out of 175 (78.86%) down-regulated proteins. They were associated with basal mt functions, such as mitochondrial energy production, metabolism, and protein folding in mitochondria (Figure 3C).

By using the k-means clustering algorithm, the mRNA and protein-expression profiles were divided into five groups depending on the abundance ratios of mt protein-mRNA: up-up (127), down-down (147), up-down (78), down-up (218), and unchanged (118) groups (Figure 4A and Table S4 for protein list). We found that up-regulated and down-regulated functional modules exhibited distinctive patterns in expression profiles (Figure 4B and C; details in Table S3). Specifically, both protein and mRNA abundances increased in the five up-regulated functional modules (Figure 4B). Conversely, mRNA abundances increased, but mt protein levels were decreased in the eight down-regulated functional modules (Figure 4C). The up-regulated functional modules were involved in mtDNA maintenance and control of mt protein transport.

We found that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins of dysfunctional mt states were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. It has been suggested that proteins cooperate with other proteins as a part of functional module which tend to physically associated or share similar expressions to deliver a certain biological function [36], [37]. Network analyses of molecular pathways or complexes elucidated the collective behavior of differentially expressed proteins and provided complementary information to conventional single gene-based analysis which routinely performed in proteomic analyses [38], [39]. We discovered that not only the relevant proteins changed their expression under dysfunctional mt state, but also the subnetworks composed of multiple functional protein groups changed their expression cooperatively to regulate biological processes. These network-module alterations are particular importance for relating an altered phenotype with dysfunctional mt state at molecular level because phenotypic alterations are more closely related with pathway remodeling than individual gene expression changes [38].",

To properly respond to changes in cellular states, these processes may require retrograde regulation [35]. Retrograde signaling regulates many cellular activities under pathophysiological conditions by changing the protein inventories of subcellular organelles. It may be possible that up-regulated mt proteins shuttle between the mitochondria and other organelles for intracellular communication [40]. Indeed, we found that the proteins of up-regulated functional modules tended to have multiple annotations of subcellular localization and to be involved in processes occurring inside and outside of mitochondria (Table S1). For example, AP-endonuclease 1 (APEX1) of the DNA repair module is known to shuttle from mitochondria to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress [41]. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK), a member of the ribonucleoprotein complex associated with mtDNA transcription, has been detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria [42]. These observations suggest that up-regulated functional modules act as cross-talk components connecting mitochondria with other organelles to sense and propagate the retrograde signal upon mtDNA depletion stress to facilitate mitochondrial survival.",

On average, levels of 5.5% of the proteins in down-regulated functional modules were increased, while levels of 4.7% of the proteins in up-regulated functional modules were decreased under the dysfunctional \u03c10 state. Proteins with opposite expression patterns in the functional module could act as negative regulators of the module [43]. For example, in the TCA cycle module, acetolactate synthase (AHAS) was up-regulated, while other proteins were down-regulated. It has been reported that upregulation of AHAS decreases the activity of the TCA cycle by reducing pyruvate flow into the cycle [44]. In addition, ATP6V1B2 and ATP6V1G1 in the ATP synthesis module were up-regulated, while other proteins were down-regulated. Upregulation of these proteins is known to participate in ATP hydrolysis, leading to the downregulation of ATP synthesis [45]. Moreover, two heat shock proteins, HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1, involved in protein folding on the mt surface were down-regulated, while other proteins were up-regulated. The heat shock proteins regulate chaperone activity in response to ATP concentrations in the cell [46]. Under the dysfunctional \u03c10 state, ATP reduction could induce the disruption of HSP90 chaperone activity. Thus, we suspect that oppositely expressed proteins may compensate for the function of other proteins in the same modules.",

It has been proposed that there is a compensatory mt protein import pathway independent from the dissipated membrane potential [47]. This pathway is known to facilitate the translocations of proteins involved in mt protein folding and mtDNA repair to the mitochondria [48].

The framework of our systematic data-integrative analysis may be useful to reliable proteome analyses for other cellular systems.

Then, we assigned biological function to the module by using Ontologizer 2.0, which collects GO representative functional annotations from proteins in each module [63], and selected functional modules if the significance (p-value) of GO enrichment was less than 0.01. The enrichment of up- or down-regulated proteins in a given functional module was used to check the consistency of protein expression in the module (hypergeometric tests, p-value <0.01).

After readjustment to pH 8.3 with 1 M Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.3), the \u03c1+ or \u03c10 protein samples were labeled with a 15-fold molar excess of cleavable cICAT light (12C) or heavy (13C) reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) relative to proteins for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Each 110-\u00b5g aliquot of separately labeled samples was equally combined and digested by trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI).

Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5\u201335% buffer B (running buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in H2O; elution buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile) over 90 min at 200 nl/min using an Agilent 1100 capillary pump system. Eluting peptides from the column were analyzed using LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometers (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). A MS survey scan from 300\u20132000 m/z was acquired with three \u03bcscans followed by three data-dependent MS/MS scans (isolation width, 1.5 m/z; normalized collision energy, 28%; dynamic exclusion lists, 100; dynamic exclusion duration, 3 min). Data from RAW MS/MS files (minimum ion counts, 15; minimum peak intensity threshold, 1; mass range, 600\u20134300 Da) were generated, and peptide sequences from the data were assigned against the International Protein Index (IPI) human database (Version 3.13; 57,034 proteins) including known contaminants (180 entries) by using a 4-node SEQUEST (version 27, revision 9) cluster with the following search parameters: specificity (no enzyme), number of missed cleavage (max three sites), cysteine mass (fixed, +227.13 for light cICAT), cysteine mass (variable, +9 for heavy cICAT), methionine mass (variable, +16 for oxidation), mass tolerance of precursor ion (3.0) and fragment ion (0.5), mass type of precursor and fragment ion (average mass), and subsequence (cysteine residue). To discriminate true proteins from false positives and to quantify the abundance of proteins, we used Trans-Proteomic Pipeline of Institute for Systems Biology (TPP; Version 1.7.2; INTERACT, PeptideProphet\u2122, ProteinProphet\u2122, XPRESS programs). The peptides with P\u22650.50 by PeptideProphet\u2122 were applied to ProteinProphet\u2122. The proteins with P\u22650.95 by ProteinProphet\u2122 were considered to have the correct identification. Single- and double-hit proteins of the correct identifications were further validated through manual inspections of MS/MS spectra (false positive rate, below 0.4%). Quantification of peptides and proteins was performed with XPRESS software, and the peptides with bad quality (e.g., below S/N\u22642) were not considered by quantification. Finally, we identified nuclear-encoded 1,121 mt proteins that included 313 down-regulated proteins (\u03c10/\u03c1+\u22640.67), 201 up-regulated proteins (\u03c10/\u03c1+\u22651.5), and 607 not significantly changed (0.67<\u03c10/\u03c1+<1.5) proteins. The thresholds of 0.67 represents the 1.5-fold decrease (\u03c10/\u03c1+\u22641/1.5), whereas the threshold of 1.5 represents 1.5-fold increase (\u03c10/\u03c1+\u22651.5). Protein abundance ratio smaller than 0.67 or larger than 1.5 were routinely-applied thresholds indicating significant changes in proteomic analyses [64], [65], [66], [67].
