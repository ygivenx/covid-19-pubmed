            "text": "HBV is the prototype member of hepadnaviridae family which contains a number of DNA viruses replicating their genome through reverse transcription of a viral RNA intermediate in hepatocytes. After cell infection mediated by the viral receptor, called sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) [2], the 3.2kb relaxed circular (rc) viral DNA genome in the virion enters the nucleus and transforms into a nucleosome-decorated covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA minichromosome. Using cccDNA as transcription template, five viral mRNAs are transcribed from different transcription initiation sites but all terminated at a same polyadenylation site, which are, 3.5~3.6 kb precore mRNA, 3.5 kb pregenomic (pg) RNA, 2.4 and 2.1 kb surface (envelope) mRNA, and 0.7kb X mRNA. Besides serving as the template for translation of viral core protein and polymerase (pol), the pgRNA is also the template for reverse transcription. The pol recognizes a stem loop structure (epsilon, \u03b5) at the 5\u2019 terminus of pgRNA to recruit core proteins to encapsidate pol/pgRNA complex into nucleocapsid, where the reverse transcription takes place to yield progeny viral rcDNA [3]. Considering the importance of viral RNA in HBV life cycle, it is conceivable that HBV RNA reduction will result in a suppression of both viral DNA replication and antigen production. Therefore, hijacking HBV RNA is believed to be an important antiviral strategy for host defense against HBV. In line with this, interferons are able to directly reduce HBV RNA through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms [4\u20137]. In terms of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), the tripartite motif-containing protein 22 (TRIM22) and DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 have been shown to inhibit HBV RNA transcription [8, 9], and the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) have been identified as host intrinsic antiviral factors against HBV through promoting the decay of HBV RNA [10, 11].",

This protein, which has been shown to be induced by both type I and type II IFNs, belongs to DEDDh subgroup of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. Sequence homologies are distributed at three distinct motifs termed as ExoI (a.a7-16), ExoII (a.a 86\u2013101) and ExoIII (a.a 147\u2013157) [12]. ISG20 is a 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exonuclease with the substrate preference of single-stranded RNA over double-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. Its enzymatic activity is mediated by the ExoII motif, as substitution of the Aspartic acid 94 (D94) in the ExoII motif to Glycine (D94G) completely abolishes its exonuclease activity [13]. Cellular proteins may be involved in regulation of ISG20 in substrate recognition and/or binding in order to avoid any non-specific cell toxicity, however which remain to be identified.",

HBV viral RNA and DNA were analyzed, as shown in Fig 2A. The result clearly demonstrated that ISG20 markedly inhibited HBV DNA replication (middle panel) primarily through reducing the steady state levels of 3.5kb viral pgRNA (top panel) which is the template for HBV DNA synthesis, and such effect is independent of promoter (HBV EnII/Cp or CMV-IE) used to transcribe the pgRNA. A similar antiviral effect of ISG20 was also observed in Huh7 cells (Fig 2B). Furthermore, the ISG20-mediated pgRNA reduction is dose dependent (S1 Fig) and not due to a possible cytotoxicity effect caused by ISG20 overexpression (S2 Fig). In addition, along with pgRNA reduction, the levels of 2.4 kb and 2.1 kb HBV surface mRNA, which share 100% sequence identity with the 3\u2019 portion of pgRNA, were also reduced upon ISG20 expression (Fig 2, top panels). The reduction of HBV 2.4/2.1 kb RNA by ISG20 was further confirmed by co-transfection of ISG20 and plasmid pLMS expressing HBV subgenomic surface mRNA in HepG2 cells (S3A Fig). Consistent with ISG20-mediated reduction of 3.5 kb and 2.4/2.1 kb HBV RNA, the levels of supernatant HBeAg and HBsAg were also significantly decreased (S3B Fig).",

To test these possibilities, we recovered the HBV plasmid DNA from the transfected cells by Hirt DNA extraction, followed by Dpn I digestion and Southern blot analysis. The result showed that the levels of input HBV plasmid DNA recovered from whole cells were equal in the absence or presence of ISG20, as revealed by Dpn I-digested fragments (S4A Fig, top panel). Furthermore, while ISG20 overexpression reduced HBV core DNA replication in cytoplasm, it did not affect the level of remaining cytoplasmic HBV plasmid DNA (S4A Fig, middle panel), further confirming that ISG20 does not alter the stability and distribution of the input HBV plasmid. In addition, ISG20 transfection in HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells also resulted in the reduction of HBV RNA, which were transcribed from the integrated HBV DNA (S4B Fig). Collectively, these results clearly exclude any negative effect of ISG20 on the stability of HBV RNA transcription template, which is consistent with the reported inability of ISG20 to degrade double stranded DNA substrate in vitro [13].",

Briefly, ISG20 expression vector or control empty vector was transfected into the inducible HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells in the absence of tetracycline (tet) to induce HBV pgRNA transcription and ISG20 expression; 36 h later, tet was added back to shut down the de novo pgRNA transcription from the transgene, and after that, the levels of HBV RNA at different time points were analyzed by Northern blot (Fig 3A). The representative Northern blot demonstrated that the levels of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells overexpressing ISG20 at each time point were less than that in the control group, suggesting that ISG20 promotes HBV RNA degradation. This is consistent with the previous observations that ISG20 functions as the 3\u2019-5\u2019 riboexonuclease to degrade single-stranded viral RNA genomes [14, 16]. It is worth noting that not every HBV RNA-containing HepDES19 cells were transfected by ISG20, therefore, the actual effect of ISG20 on HBV RNA stability ought to be stronger than observed in this experiment. To further quantitatively validate the observed enhancement of HBV RNA degradation by ISG20, we transfected HepG2 cells with tetracycline-inducible HBV expression vector pTREHBVDES and plasmid pTet-off expressing the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA), together with either control vector or ISG20 plasmid. In this way, both HBV RNA and ISG20 coexisted in same cells. Four days later, similarly to the above experiment in HepDES19 cells, tetracycline was added back to block new round of pgRNA transcription, and the time course HBV RNA level was quantified by qPCR. As shown in Fig 3B, the regular half-life of intracellular HBV RNA was approximately 6 h, which is consistent with previous measurements [10, 23], but the decay kinetics of HBV RNA was much faster in cells transfected with ISG20, of which the HBV RNA half-life was much less than 3 h, suggesting that ISG20 promotes HBV RNA decay. Hence, we conclude that ISG20-mediated HBV RNA reduction is primarily through downregulation of HBV RNA stability.",

It was therefore of interest to assess the antiviral activity of endogenous ISG20 against HBV infection under its basal and induced levels. Firstly, we performed the test in HBV stable cell line HepDES19 [24]. As shown in Fig 4, knock down of ISG20 expression in the absence of IFN-\u03b1 treatment resulted in a marked upregulation of the steady state levels of HBV total RNA, encapsidated pgRNA, and DNA (comparing lane 4 to lane l). The observed relatively greater upregulation of core DNA than viral RNA upon knock down of ISG20 might be due to the longer lifespan of DNA. When the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1, ISG20 was upregulated, and viral RNA and DNA were reduced, in an IFN dose-dependent manner (lanes 1\u20133). It is worth to note that the IFN-elicited reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells was less profound than in HBV-transfected cells with ISG20 overexpression (compared Fig 4 to Fig 2). Such difference might be due to the reported weak response of hepatoma cells to IFN treatment [25], and/or the potential unknown negative regulator(s) of ISG20 co-induced by IFN. Nonetheless, in the cells treated with IFN-\u03b1 and ISG20 siRNA, the levels of HBV RNA were restored to the untreated control level (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 1\u20133), suggesting that ISG20 plays a major role in IFN-mediated reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells. However, neither viral RNA nor DNA reached their levels in cells treated with ISG20 siRNA only (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4), indicating that other ISGs are involved in IFN-mediated suppression of HBV DNA replication at multiple steps.",

The endogenous ISG20 in HepG2-NTCP12 cells was stably inhibited through lentiviral shRNA transduction. The obtained ISG20 knock down cell line and control knock down cell line were then infected with HBV and treated with or without IFN-\u03b1. As shown in Fig 5A, the basal ISG20 expression was successfully knocked down in HepG2-NTCP12-shISG20 cells (comparing lane 3 to lane1), and IFN-\u03b1 significantly upregulated ISG20 expression in the HepG2-NTCP12-shcontrol cells (comparing lane 2 to lane1), but only slightly induced ISG20 in the HepG2-NTCP12-shISG20 cells (comparing lane 4 to lane3). Then the outcomes of HBV infection were analyzed. The HBcAg immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that knock down of ISG20 resulted in a higher percentage of HBV positive cells when compared to control cells without or with IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Fig 5B). Because that the ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation will lead to an overall suppression of the entire HBV life cycle in the infection system, we infer that the increased percentage of core staining-positive cell number in HBV infected HepG2-NTCP-shISG20 cells is a combinational end effect of increased viral protein expression, DNA replication, and cccDNA synthesis, plus the possible higher virus spread rate. Since HBV RNA is a more convincing marker for HBV infection and the authentic antiviral target of ISG20, the qPCR assay of HBV total RNA from the infected cells further demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 is able to reduce HBV RNA in infected cells, and knocking down of ISG20 greatly favors HBV infection in both IFN-treated and untreated cells (Fig 5C). Consistent with the observations in HepDES19 cells (Fig 4), inhibition of ISG20 significantly but partially abrogated the overall antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 in HBV infected cells (Fig 5B and 5C), presumably due to the induction of other antiviral ISGs. Collectively, the above data suggested that ISG20 serves as a host intrinsic restriction factor to limit HBV infection under both basal expression and cytokine induction.",

In contrast, increased amount of ISG20D94G resulted in the decreased amount of HBV RNA associated with Pol, suggesting that ISG20D94G competes with HBV Pol for binding of pgRNA and thus inhibits HBV pgRNA encapsidation. It is assumed that the wildtype ISG20 may possess additional antiviral function as what ISG20D94G does in cells, but the inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation, if any, will likely be overwhelmed by its dominant primary effect on RNA degradation.",

Firstly, we found that all those pgRNA mutants with internal deletions (within nt 2009-3182/1-1574) were sensitive to ISG20 (S8B Fig). Then the terminal redundancy (TR, nt 1820\u20131918, containing \u03b5 (nt 1849\u20131909)) mutants with deletion of either 5\u2019 TR (\u03945TR) or 3\u2019 TR (\u03943TR) from pgRNA were tested. Interestingly, while the single TR deleting pgRNA remained sensitive to ISG20 (Fig 9B, lanes 1\u20134), the pgRNA mutant with both 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 TR removed (\u03945/3TR) became completely resistant (Fig 9B, lanes 5\u20136), indicating that one copy of the TR sequences is sufficient to confer the susceptibility of HBV pgRNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation. This is also consistent with the fact that ISG20 is also able to degrade HBV subgenomic RNAs which only contain the 3\u2019 TR (Fig 2 and S3 Fig).",

Since ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation relies on TR sequence (Fig 9) and ISG20D94G competes with Pol for HBV RNA binding (Fig 8), it is therefore of immediate interest to investigate whether ISG20 also directly binds on HBV \u03b5 to exert its antiviral functions. To this end, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was employed. As shown in Fig 10, purified recombinant His-tagged ISG20 proteins were incubated with 5\u2019 radiolabeled HBV \u03b5 RNA in vitro and the protein/RNA complexes were analyzed via the mobility shifting of the RNA in the native polyacrylamide gel. The proper folding of stem-loop structure of \u03b5 RNA was confirmed by recombinant Pol/\u03b5 complex formation as detected in the EMSA assay (S9 Fig). Interestingly, in the absence of other cellular proteins, His-ISG20 could directly, dose-dependently bind on \u03b5 RNA, shown as the shift bands in Fig 10C (lanes 3, 5, 7), and the binding specificity between His-ISG20 and \u03b5 was confirmed by the His-antibody(Ab) /His-ISG20/\u03b5 super-complex formation detected as a super-shift in EMSA (lanes 4, 6, 8). Competition of ISG20 binding to the radiolabeled \u03b5 RNA by excess amount of cold \u03b5 probes indicated again that ISG20 specifically binds to HBV \u03b5 (lanes 9, 10, 11). It is of note that the incubation of ISG20 and \u03b5 RNA during EMSA was performed in protein/RNA binding buffer without manganese, an essential ion for the enzymatic activity of ISG20 [13], therefore the degradation of \u03b5 RNA, if any could occur, would not be observed in this binding assay.",

Interestingly, ISG20 bound to the lower stem with bulge sequence serving as loop, but not the upper stem-loop of \u03b5 in EMSA (Fig 11B), which indicates that ISG20 recognizes the lower stem and/or bulge of HBV \u03b5 as its binding site. To further determine the binding position within the lower stem and bulge region, the bulge sequences were mutated or the lower stem were truncated from the bottom (Fig 11A), and used as probes in EMSA. Interestingly, we found that the loop (or bulge) sequence is not critical for ISG20 binding as long as the lower stem is intact; however the bottom 4 base-pairs of the stem is indispensable for ISG20 binding (Fig 11C). To further confirm the requirement of these 4 base-pairs for ISG20 to carry out its biological functions, we disrupted the base pairing at the bottom of \u03b5 stem-loop in HBV 2.1 kb surface mRNA by removing 4 nucleotides from the 3\u2019 end of \u03b5 coding sequence, and found that the mutant RNA became resistant to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation in cell cultures (Fig 11D).

Three distinct exonuclease motifs, namely Exo I (a.a7-16), Exo II (a.a 86\u2013101) and Exo III (a.a 147\u2013157), have been predicted in ISG20 protein sequence from previous studies [14, 30] (Fig 12A). Based on that, the recombinant mutant ISG20 proteins with each Exo domain deletion or Exo II D94G mutation were tested for \u03b5 binding activity by EMSA. As shown in Fig 12B and 12C, in comparison to wildtype ISG20, deletion of Exo I or Exo II did not reduce, but even increased the binding affinity of ISG20 with \u03b5 (lanes 2\u20134); however ISG20 with Exo III deletion completely lost the binding activity (lane 5), indicating that the Exo III is the functional binding domain of ISG20 for its RNA substrate. In addition, the enzymatically inactive D94G mutant retains its function for \u03b5 binding (lane 6), which is consistent with the observed association of ISG20D94G with HBV RNA and subsequent inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation in cells (Figs 6\u20138). It is worth noting that the \u0394Exo I and \u0394Exo II deletion mutants, as well as the ISG20D94G mutant, exhibited altered mobility compared to wildtype ISG20 in the gel shift assay (Fig 12C, lane 2 vs. lanes 3, 4, 6). While it is predictable that the faster mobility of \u0394Exo I:\u03b5 and \u0394Exo II:\u03b5 complexes is likely due to the protein\u2019s lower molecular weight (MW), the lower shift of ISG20D94G:\u03b5 complex is probably because that such RNP complex exhibits a different structural conformation compared to the ISG20:\u03b5 complex.",

            "text": "Lastly, we set out to characterize the enzymatic activity of ISG20 against \u03b5 RNA in vitro. The previous biochemistry study has demonstrated that ISG20 catalyzes RNA degradation in vitro in a manganese-dependent manner [13]. As shown in Fig 13, under the reaction condition that supports ISG20 ribonuclease activity [13], a wide spectrum endoribonuclease RNase A efficiently degraded \u03b5 RNA as a positive control (panel A and B, lanes 1\u20133). However, ISG20 exhibited much less efficiency to degrade the full length \u03b5 RNA substrate (panel A and B, lanes 1, 4\u20135), and other two stem-loop subdomains (US+L, LS+B) (panel A, lanes 6\u201311), suggesting that ISG20 alone does not favor RNA with secondary structures for degradation. Such observation is consistent with a previous study showing that ISG20 operated poorly on double-stranded regions of RNA substrate in vitro [13]. In line with these, we found that ISG20 was able to catalyze the degradation of RNA substrate derived from the left arm of \u03b5 (panel B, lanes 6\u20138), which is lack of secondary structures. Furthermore, ISG20 efficiently degraded the single-stranded linear 30-mer poly(rA) oligo in vitro (panel B, lane 11), confirming that the recombinant ISG20 protein used in the assay was enzymatically active. As a control, RNase A was unable to degrade poly(rA) because it only cleaves RNA string at the 3\u00b4 end of pyrimidine (rC or U) residues (panel B, lane 10) [31]. Since the RNA substrates were 5\u2019 radiolabeled, the pattern of degradation intermediates generated by ISG20 is consistent with the 3\u2019-5\u2019 exoribonuclease activity of ISG20 (panel B, lanes 7, 8, 11). Collectively, the above in vitro data indicate that other host cofactor(s) may be required to coordinate with ISG20 for the observed efficient HBV RNA degradation in cells.",

The selectivity of ISG20 for HBV RNA is determined by a unique viral ribonucleotide string that shapes a stem-loop structure (\u03b5) which exists in all HBV RNA species. ISG20 directly binds to the lower stem of \u03b5 through the C-terminal Exo III domain, and such protein-RNA interaction, possibly with the assistance of a host cofactor(s), will lead to the major antiviral action of ISG20, which is the enzymatic activity dependent HBV RNA degradation. Subsequently, viral protein translation and DNA replication will be inhibited (Fig 14). In addition, under certain circumstance that the enzymatic activity of ISG20 could be inhibited (i.e. the ISG20D94G mutant), the binding of ISG20 to 5\u2019 \u03b5 may remain antiviral by competing the binding of viral polymerase with \u03b5 and blocking the subsequent pgRNA encapsidation and reverse transcription.",

            "text": "It is well documented that, during acute HBV infection, the activation of host T-cell responses plays a pivotal role in clearing virus from hepatocytes via a noncytolytic mechanism, which is largely attributed to the antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines produced by the infiltrating immune cells, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 [32, 33]. To date, IFN-\u03b1 is the only available immunotherapy for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [34]. Besides serving as an immunomodulatory agent to regulate the host adaptive immunity against HBV, the intracellular antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 is mediated by an array of ISGs. In search of intrahepatic ISGs associated with immune clearance of HBV, a growing body of evidence implies that ISG20 may be involved in IFN mediated inhibition of HBV, including 1) the upregulation of ISG20 in HBV transgenic mouse hepatocyte cell lines in which the HBV replication was inhibited by IFN [19]; 2) the elevation of ISG20 level in viral clearance phase of an acutely HBV infected Chimpanzee [35]; and 3) the upregulation of ISG20 in chronic hepatitis B patients who responded well to IFN-\u03b1 therapy [21]. Consistent with the above findings, we found that ISG20 can be highly induced in hepatocytes in vitro by all three types of interferons, and it plays a significant role in IFN-\u03b1 elicited antiviral effects on HBV infection and replication (Figs 1, 4 and 5). Considering that HBV RNA are essential genetic components for viral replication and gene expression in its life cycle, upregulation of ISG20 expression by cytokines to eliminate HBV RNA is a very economical and efficient way in host defense mechanisms. In addition, our study also expands the antiviral spectrum of ISG20 to a DNA virus. Considering that current HBV therapy with nucleoside analogues is ineffective against viral protein expression and cannot efficiently promote HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion [34], it is thus envisioned that the ISG20-based antiviral therapy could be developed in the future to reduce both viremia and antigenemia in CHB patients.",

            "text": "While its cellular function remains elusive, ISG20 has been previously shown to inhibit a number of RNA viruses, including VSV, influenza viruses, HIV-1, picornaviruses (EMCV, HAV), and flaviviruses (HCV, WNV, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)) [16\u201318, 36, 37]. The previously reported antiviral effects of ISG20 on these RNA viruses are all dependent on its exonuclease activity, though the degradation of viral RNA directly catalyzed by ISG20 has not been experimentally confirmed. However, RNA degradation might not be the only mechanism of ISG20\u2019s antiviral action. For instance, Zhou et al found that ISG20 did not promote the degradation of a replication-defective HCV RNA genome in Huh7.5 cells [17]; and Qu et al observed that ISG20 inhibits Influenza A Virus replication through interaction with viral nucleoproteins [37]. Furthermore, not all the RNA viruses are susceptible to ISG20, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has shown resistance to ISG20 in cell cultures [17], indicating that there is viral specific factor(s) to determine the antiviral specificity of ISG20. Here, we clearly demonstrated that ISG20 is able to promote HBV RNA degradation in cell cultures, and such effect is dependent on the protein\u2019s exonuclease activity (Figs 2\u20136). During the preparation of this manuscript, Leong et al also reported that ISG20 inhibited HBV replication in cell cultures and in hydrodynamic injected mouse liver via exoribonuclease-dependent degradation of viral RNA, which is largely consistent with our results, but their study did not touch on the molecular mechanism for the selective targeting of HBV RNA by ISG20 [38]. In our study, we further mapped the sequence element responsible for ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation to \u03b5 region in HBV RNA genome (Figs 7\u20139), and confirmed the direct binding of ISG20 to \u03b5 in EMSA assay (Fig 10). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report revealing that the RNA sequence/structure-specific recognition is required for ISG20 to degrade its viral RNA substrate. Such characteristic of ISG20 makes it mechanistically distinct from RNase L, a well-known antiviral ISG that, upon activation, nonspecifically destroys both viral and cellular RNA in cells [39]. In this regard, ISG20 represents a novel class of cellular antiviral ISGs, which is reminiscent of the sequence-specific antiviral RNAi system [40], but ISG20 targets viral RNA directly without the help of small guide RNA.",

It is thus conceivable that ISG20 recognizes \u03b5 as a \u201cnon-self\u201d target to initiate its antiviral function. In line with this, it has been recently reported that host innate sensor RIG-I binds to \u03b5 to trigger IFN-\u03bb production [43]. In addition, we further determined that the bottom 4bp of lower stem of \u03b5 is the minimal responsive element of ISG20, as the removal of such sequence from HBV RNA made ISG20 lose both the \u03b5 binding activity in vitro and HBV RNA reduction effect in cell cultures (Fig 11). These sequence and structure information could serve as a consensus motif to predict ISG20-responsive RNA elements in other viruses, and perhaps host RNAs as well.",

Since ISG20 targets viral mRNA for destabilization, it is plausible that they may also alter the stability of certain cellular mRNA to regulate host gene expression. For example, the observed enhancement of HBV S1 promoter activity by ISG20 may be due to the ISG20-mediated upregulation of host transcription factor(s) required for S1 promoter activity or downregulation of negative regulator(s) of S1 promoter (S5 Fig). This notion is also supported by previous observations that ISG20-mediated antiviral effect on HCV was not through inhibition of HCV RNA stability or translation, indicating that ISG20 might degrade the mRNA of a host factor(s) essential for HCV replication [17]. More interestingly, considering that ISG20 favors short RNAs with stem-loop structures for affinity binding, it is also possible that ISG20 potentially targets host microRNA (miRNA) precursors (pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA) [44] and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [45], which may contain \u03b5-like stem-loop structures, to regulate miRNA processing and lncRNA stability, respectively. In addition, it is known that IFNs regulate cellular gene expression primarily at the mRNA level [46], so it is possible that ISG20, as a IFN-inducible RNase, may partly mediate the action of IFN through altering the host mRNA stability. We are currently conducting RNA-seq analysis to search for potential host RNA substrates of ISG20.",

We found that the catalytic site (D94) in Exo II of ISG20 was essential for HBV RNA reduction, but the ISG20D94G mutant retained RNA binding activity and inhibited HBV pgRNA encapsidation through competing the binding of HBV polymerase to \u03b5 (Figs 6\u20138). Although such antiviral effect may be just minor in the context of wildtype ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation, this serendipitous finding led us to discover the binding property of ISG20 with HBV RNA (Fig 10). Interestingly, the minimal binding site on \u03b5 for ISG20 is located at the bottom 4bp of the stem-loop (Fig 11), which is dispensable for HBV polymerase to bind \u03b5 [47], indicating that the inhibition of polymerase binding by ISG20 is due to ISG20/\u03b5 interaction-induced steric hindrance and/or conformational shift of \u03b5. In addition, the domain of ISG20 for \u03b5 binding was mapped to the Exo III region (Fig 12), suggesting that the substrate interaction and degradation domains of ISG20 are separated. This is consistent with the reported crystal structure analysis of ISG20, which predicted that the amino acid composition of Exo II is unfavorable for RNA binding [30]. However, no classical RNA binding motif was found in the Exo III domain or the entire ISG20 sequence by computational prediction (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/protein/Q96AZ6). ISG20 has been shown to interact with host U1/2/3 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) [48], which also have stem-loops, further indicating that ISG20 may possess a novel binding motif for such kind of double stranded RNA secondary structures including HBV \u03b5.",

ZAP exerts its antiviral activity against HBV with certain features similar to ISG20, specifically, both ZAP and ISG20 interact with HBV RNA for RNA degradation in a \u03b5-dependent manner. Since ZAP does not possess nuclease activity [49], our initial hypothesis was that ZAP might recruit ISG20 to \u03b5 for RNA degradation. However, co-immunoprecipitation assay did not reveal any detectable association between ZAP and ISG20 in the absence or presence of HBV RNA (S10 Fig), indicating that ZAP and ISG20 work independently to target HBV \u03b5 for their antiviral functions, and host cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to recognize the \u201cnon-self\u201d HBV \u03b5 as an antiviral sensing signal.",

In addition, since ISG20 could single-handedly degrade poly(rA) oligo in the in vitro degradation assay (Fig 13B), whether the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is required to remove the poly(A) tail in ISG20-mediated HBV mRNA degradation reaction awaits further investigations. Interestingly, our in vitro RNA degradation assay demonstrated that ISG20 efficiently degrades single-stranded RNA but not the \u03b5 RNA substrate (Fig 13), indicating that additional host factor(s), likely a RNA helicase, is required to unwind the double-stranded region of \u03b5 for ISG20 to catalyze RNA degradation. Therefore, we have embarked on the identification of cofactors in ISG20 degradesome complex by proteomic approach.",
