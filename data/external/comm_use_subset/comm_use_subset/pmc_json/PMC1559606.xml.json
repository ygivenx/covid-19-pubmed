When the fears declined and utilization data became available, we were able retrospectively to review the broad hospice situation during the SARS epidemic in Taiwan, one of the most heavily affected countries.",

All hospice care programs in Taiwan until then had been hospital-based. A universal health insurance program started in Taiwan in 1995 and now covers nearly all inhabitants (21,984,415 beneficiaries at the end of 2003, equivalent to a coverage rate of 97.3%) [12]. During the early years of National Health Insurance (NHI), admission to hospice wards was reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis, as in acute wards. The payment for services of nurses and other ancillary staff was included in the room fee. This method of reimbursement put the intensive-care hospice at a great disadvantage. After years of negotiation, the Bureau of National Health Insurance began to implement a special program for hospice wards in July 2000. The payment changed to a per-diem lump sum and was generally improved. Any hospice ward was free to join the new program, which also had stricter requirements on personnel and facilities.",

Moreover, in many cities and regions of Taiwan, the infection spread from one hospital to several others. Five hospitals had to discontinue routine or emergency services totally. Stricter quarantine was implemented after 28 April. Real panic ensued in Taiwanese society. The last probable case was reported on 14 June, and Taiwan was removed from the list of SARS-affected countries by the World Health Organization on 5 July 2003 [14]. In retrospect, the SARS epidemic in Taiwan had involved 668 probable cases with severe deterioration of pulmonary function and 181 deaths [15].",

Twenty-five hospitals had participated in the NHI hospice program: from 12 hospitals in July 2000 to 21 in December 2003, during which time 4 hospitals dropped out. After computing the utilization of hospice beds for each day, we found that there were indeed cyclic fluctuations around the year. Because data were only available for a few years and the numbers of hospice wards and beds had increased over time, it did not seem appropriate to deploy a conventional time series analysis, e.g. the autoregressive integrated moving average method [3,4,17]. Instead, we performed a before-and-after comparison of monthly utilizations between 2002 and 2003 and plotted daily utilization. The analysis was limited to those hospitals that offered hospice inpatient services throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. Because insurance claims were normally submitted after the patients' discharge, the claims for the final month of the available datasets contained no data for patients who were still hospitalised at the end of that month. Thus, the data for December 2003 were not analysed.",

We also analysed the patients who were admitted to hospice wards during the peak period of the SARS epidemic (i.e. May/June 2003) and compared them with the patients admitted during the same months of the previous year.

The unit of hospice/hospital ward utilization was the patient-day, i.e. each claimed day of hospitalisation. Conventionally, the discharge day is not counted as a hospitalisation day in insurance claims. For example, if a patient was hospitalised from 1 January to 7 January, the per-diem fees for physician and room services were payable only from 1 January to 6 January. We used two-sample t-tests to compare the age distributions of those admitted in May/June 2003 with those admitted in May/June 2002, and Pearson's chi-square test to compare the sex and diagnosis distributions. We also used one-way analysis of variance to compare the age distributions of those admitted in May/June 2003 to hospice wards of different accreditation levels and locations. A P-value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Release 13.0 for Windows, 2004, SPSS Inc., Chicago).",

Our study, based on nationwide data, gave a complete and exact picture of hospice utilization. The hospice, also known as palliative care, has usually been considered as conservative and non-acute. One could well imagine that the use of hospice services would be compromised because of fears during uncertain times. Our findings support this view. Hospice inpatient utilization in Taiwan was indeed more sensitive to the emerging epidemic than general inpatient utilization. Not only was the reduction sharper, but also recovery to the previous level took longer.",

This meant that some patients might have been discharged earlier. It remains unknown whether the decrease of utilization was due to patients' voluntary decisions or to manoeuvring by the hospitals. According to our personal experiences, both patients' decisions and hospital policies could have played a role. On the patient's side, the family might have a major part in the decision about hospice care, because weak terminally ill patients are usually dependent on their families. The fear of SARS might have come from the family rather than the patient. Only interviews with the patients and their caregivers could give a satisfactory answer.",

The impact was related to the locations and accreditation levels of the hospitals with hospice wards: the bigger the hospital, the stronger the SARS impact. Other features, e.g. the admission policy and mission of each hospital during the SARS epidemic, might have played a role. Hospices in middle Taiwan were most severely affected; only the hospice in eastern Taiwan was negligibly affected. The main island of Taiwan has 22 cities and counties. The probable cases of SARS appeared mainly in Taipei city (in northern Taiwan), Taipei county (northern), Taoyuan county (northern), Kaohsiung city (southern) and Kaohsiung county (southern) [13]. On 26 March 2003, a resident of Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens flew to Taiwan and travelled to Taichung (in middle Taiwan). That man's brother in Taiwan became Taiwan's first SARS fatality [15]. This might partly explain the impact of SARS in middle Taiwan (Figure 4).",

In retrospect, it was reasonable and preferable to reduce hospitalisations. A similar phenomenon was observed simultaneously in childbirth in Taiwan [7]. Many deliveries were shifted from secondary and tertiary care hospitals to primary clinics. The question remains whether continuity and quality of care could be ensured. It is unlikely that patients shifted from the 15 hospices in the current study to the other six (unanalysed) hospices, which either quitted or joined the hospice program after the SARS epidemic. However, the possibility of patient flow to other non-hospice wards cannot be excluded. Our claims-based study could not determine whether the needs of patients with terminal illnesses were met during the epidemic, and threw no light on the psychological impact on patients and healthcare workers [20].",
