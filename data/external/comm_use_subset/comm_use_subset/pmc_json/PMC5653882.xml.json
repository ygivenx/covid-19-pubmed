            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens characterized by respiratory signs, and in young chickens by severe respiratory distress and a decrease in egg production in layers.1 The chicken was considered the only natural host of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) but recently pheasants has been introduced as the other natural host for IBV.2 The disease is transmitted by the respiratory route, direct contact and indirectly through mechanical spread.3 The virus belongs to Coronaviridae, Order Nidovirales. The IBV and other avian coronaviruses of turkeys and pheasants are classified as group 3 coronaviruses.4 Its genome consists of about 27 kb and codes for four structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, and the envelope (E) protein.5,6 The spike glycoprotein (S) is anchored in the viral envelope and is post-translationally cleaved into two proteins S1 and S2.7 The S protein is very diverse in terms of both nucleotide sequence and deduced primary protein structure, especially in the upstream part of S1.8 Three hypervariable regions (HVRs) have been identified in the S1 subunit.9-11 The S1 subunit induces neutralizing, serotype-specific, and haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies.12-17 Amino acid changes in the spike (S) glycoprotein lead to the generation of genetic variants.18,19 The high frequency of new IBV variants is a distinguished characteristic of this virus among other coronaviruses.20 Many IBV serotypes have been described probably due to the frequent point mutations that occur in RNA viruses and also recombination events. Therefore, the characterization of virus isolates which exists in the field is very important.21 More than 50 serotypes of IBV have been identified and new variants continued to emerge despite the use of live attenuated and killed IBV vaccines.22-24",

The aim of the present study was to detect and identify the type of prevailing IBV strains in Bushehr province. Previous studies comparing conventional and nested RT-PCR methods indicated that nested RT-PCR was more sensitive for detection of IBV.32-34 The implementation of nationwide genotyping of IBV strains is necessary to determine the distribution of virus genotypes and to develop and adopt suitable vaccination strategies. Antigenic characterization of IBV isolates is important for selecting new and appropriate vaccines for the corresponding geographical regions.35 New serotypes or variant strains may emerge due to only a few changes in the amino acid sequence of the S1protein.3 Therefore, the S1 gene of the isolates should be determined to differentiate field and vaccine isolates.36 Regarding the results obtained, 12 IBV isolates were identified. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1gene nucleotide sequences showed that most of the Iranian isolates belonged to two distinct groups.",
