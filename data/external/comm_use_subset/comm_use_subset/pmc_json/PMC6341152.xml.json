Of the 213 CAD mink farms, 46 farms are located in Ontario (Statistics Canada, 2016b, Table 003\u20100015). Enteritis in mink is a generalized condition thought to be caused by multiple viral and bacterial agents, and outbreaks of diarrhea on farms pose significant economic risk to producers (Englund, Chriel, Dietz, & Hedlund, 2002; Gorham et al., 1990). Viral agents known to cause enteric disease in mink include astrovirus, rotavirus, and mink enteritis virus (Arnold, Collier, Balows, & Sussman, 1997; Englund et al., 2002; Otto et al., 2015; Reynolds, 1969; Wang et al., 2015) although the prevalence of these viruses has not been monitored in Canada.",

The resulting reads that aligned over at least 100 bp with a reference viral sequence were compiled and used for further analysis. Top phage and nonphage viral families were identified for all sample libraries, and the sequences from specific viruses which had the highest prevalence were compared between for adult females and kits, and between farms grouped based on five geographical regions using JMP Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) (Figure S1). The most prevalent vertebrate virus sequences were further assessed based on identity, sequence length, and prevalence across samples. Viral sequences with lower levels of similarity in amino acid identity (average identity <90%) were then compared to these reference viral sequences (GenBank) to identify the level of identity of protein\u2010encoding genes. All detected sequences for each virus with low average identity were used for de novo assembly in Geneious 10.1.3, followed by phylogenetic analysis in phylogeny.fr with their closest related viral sequences (BLASTn hits with the highest identity) (Dereeper et al., 2008).",

Sequences with highest similarity to gyrovirus Tu243 (KF294861, Circoviridae) had segments with 100% identity to gyrovirus Tu243 VP1 and VP2 genes, as well as 63% identity to the VP1 gene of gyrovirus 4. The longest sequence had 64% identity over 76% (1,530/2,020) of the gyrovirus Tu243 genome. Phylogenetic analysis shows that assembled sequence (gyrovirus 2014\u2010ON_consensus) clustered most closely with gyrovirus Tu243 and gyrovirus 4 strain D137 (JX310702), and was also closely related to gyrovirus GyV3 (JQ308210), avian gyrovirus 2 (HM590588), human gyrovirus 1 strain 915 F 06 007 FD (FR823283), gyrovirus Tu789 (KF294862), and chicken anemia virus (M55918) (Figure 1e) (Chu et al., 2013; Phan et al., 2014; Sauvage et al., 2011). Segments of detected sequences had 100% identity to NS1, VP1, and VP2 proteins. The assembled sequences with highest similarity to chicken parvovirus ABU\u2010P1 (GU214704, Parvoviridae) (parvovirus 2014\u2010ON_consensus) was highly related to the genomes of chicken parvovirus ABU\u2010P1 and turkey parvovirus 260 (GU214706), which clustered separately from turkey parvovirus 1,078 (GU214705) (Figure 1f) (Day & Zsak, 2010). Sequences with highest similarity to chicken\u2010associated smacovirus strain RS/BR/2015/4 (KY086299, unclassified) encoded for capsid and replication\u2010associated proteins with 100% and 95% identities to chicken\u2010associated smacovirus strain RS/BR/2015/4 and human smacovirus (AJF23075). In phylogenetic analysis, smacovirus 2014\u2010ON_consensus sequence clustered most closely with chicken\u2010associated smacovirus strains RS/BR/2015/1\u2013RS/BR/2015/4 (KY086298\u2013KY086301), but were also closely related to bovine feces\u2010associated smacovirus strain GP3_46075_cow (KT86222) and human smacovirus 1 isolate Virginia/2/2012/Chesapeake/J23 (KP233186) (Figure 1g).",

            "text": "This study is a preliminary assessment of viral sequences in the fecal matter of healthy commercial mink on 40 Ontario farms, and the diversity of bacteriophage and eukaryotic virus sequences was fairly consistent with previous research on the fecal virome of carnivorous species (Feh\u00e9r et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2014; Phan et al., 2015; Smits et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). The 12 most prevalent phages detected in this study represent 70% (76,558/109,612) of all detected phage sequences. Comparison between the phage sequences and their respective bacterial hosts in the same cohort of mink fecal samples show that Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas species were also prevalent in the mink microbiome (unpublished data). Bacillus, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, and Proteus bacterial populations were not found to be highly prevalent in the mink fecal microbiome study (unpublished data). In a fecal microbiome study conducted on samples from mink in Northeast China, Zhao et al. (2017) showed that the two most prevalent bacterial genera were Clostridium and Escherichia, phages, both of which were found in our study. Interestingly, significantly higher numbers of Pseudomonas\u2010associated phage sequences were detected in adult female fecal samples compared to kit samples (q = 0.02), but since the detected sequences may not represent colonization by Pseudomonas species, the implications of these results remain unclear. Although previous studies have shown that lytic phage therapies may be useful in controlling Pseudomonas bacterial populations (Cao et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2016), further investigation is required to understand the natural role that the associated bacteriophage species play in bacterial populations. Producers were asked to voluntarily report the use of antimicrobials on farms, but due to only partial completion of the survey, the information collected on antimicrobial use from the 2014 sample cohort may not be fully representative. Therefore, any relationship between antimicrobial use and the relative abundance of targeted bacterial species could not be analyzed.",

Previous fecal virome studies in ferrets and felids have also found high numbers of viral sequences belonging to the families Parvoviridae, Anelloviridae, and Picornaviridae, but have also detected sequences from the families Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Hepeviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Coronaviridae (Feh\u00e9r et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2014; Smits et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). High numbers of sequences with 84%\u201396% identity to posavirus 3 strain 958\u20104 were identified, which has been previously detected in fecal samples collected from commercial swine in high animal density farms (Hause, Hesse, & Anderson, 2015). Hause et al. (2015) suggest that this strain of posavirus is derived from nematodes parasitizing commercial swine. The detected posavirus sequences may be the result of contamination from the soil at the time of fecal sample collection, but also could be attributed to the mink diet, which often consists of pork and poultry products, or nematode infections in the mink gut (Krog, Breum, Jenson, & Larsen, 2013). Similarly, the identified avian\u2010associated viral sequences (chicken anemia virus, parvovirus, smacovirus, and avian adeno\u2010associated virus) were most likely the result of mink diet. Previous evidence from viral metagenomic studies and case reports in ferrets, felids, mink, and other wild carnivores have also hypothesized that the presence of avian viruses and swine viruses in fecal samples is due to the diet of the animals (Bodewes et al., 2014; Feh\u00e9r et al., 2014; Krog et al., 2013; Smits et al., 2013). Further research is required to determine the correlation between diet and the fecal virome of mink. This is also the first report of mink bocavirus sequences in commercial mink fecal samples in Canada, with 98%\u2013100% identity to the strain identified in 2016 in China (Yang et al., 2016). This strain was most closely related to feline bocavirus (JQ692585). Yang et al. (2016) found no correlation between mink bocavirus and diarrhea, but stated that these results may not be fully representative due to the small sample size.",

HCBI8.215\u2010like virus 2014\u2010ON_consensus was found to be more closely related to torque teno virus strain TTV\u2010HD14a.

Aside from mink bocavirus, the other prevalent vertebrate viruses identified in this study have been previously isolated in other species. HCBI8.215 virus was first isolated from the serum of healthy cattle, and gyrovirus Tu243 and GyV3 were isolated from human fecal samples (Lamberto, Gunst, Muller, Hausen, & de Villiers, 2014; Phan et al., 2012, 2014). Six of the 15 prevalent vertebrate viruses described in this study are of avian origin. Although virus shedding does not represent active infections, some of the viruses identified in this study may have the potential to be transmitted to the humans, commercial and wild animals in close proximity to mink farms due to poor biosecurity (Compo et al., 2017).",
