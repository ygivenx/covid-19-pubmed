            "text": "The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response provides a potent defense against pathogens (1). Upon invasion, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are detected by specific receptors in the cells. These can be located on the surface of the cell, as in the case of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or intracellularly, as in the case of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). PAMP recognition triggers a series of signaling cascades that lead to the production and secretion of Type I IFN. Type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, and others) binds to IFN receptors present on the surface of all cell types and activates Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling. This gives rise to the nuclear translocation of the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (IFN regulatory factor 9) complex that binds IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activates their transcription. A similar response is induced by Type III IFN (IFN\u03bb) upon binding to its receptor (2, 3). In contrast, Type II IFN or IFN\u03b3, produced by cells of the immune system, binds to the widely expressed IFN\u03b3 receptor (4, 5) leading to nuclear translocation of STAT1 homodimers, which bind to gamma-activated sequences (GAS) in the promoter of immunoregulatory genes.",

Among antiviral genes, there are factors that function to increase cell sensitivity to PAMPs (OAS and PKR) or true antiviral effectors that block viral entry (Mx, IFITM, and TRIM), virus replication, translation and stability (IFIT, OAS, PKR, and ISG15), or viral release (viperin and tetherin/BST2) (8). While most IFN-induced factors known to date are proteins, IFN also activates the expression of several microRNAs that contribute to the antiviral state or to the control of IFN response (12). Few studies have been performed to address whether IFN could also regulate expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (13\u201315). In recent years, viral infection has been reported to be able to induce the expression of cellular lncRNAs. This has been shown for infection with enterovirus, influenza, HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, and the SARS coronavirus (13, 16\u201323) (Carnero et al., in preparation). The lncRNA signature found after infection should be a mixture of transcripts induced by the virus and transcripts that respond to the cellular antiviral pathways activated by the infection. In fact, activation of TLRs by PAMPs induces the expression of several lncRNAs. TLR2 signaling leads to the activation of lncRNA-COX2, which regulates the expression of genes related to the immune system (24). Activation of TLR3 results in increased NEAT1, which increases the expression of genes such as IL8 (19). TLR4 controls IL1b-eRNA and IL1b-RBT46 lncRNAs whose downregulation diminishes IL1b and accumulation of LPS-induced RNAs (25). Likewise, the LPS-induced inflammatory response is controlled by lnc-IL7R (26). Innate activation also induces linc1992/THRIL, which controls TNF\u03b1 and other genes involved in the immune response (27). In turn, TNF\u03b1 induces Lethe, a pseudogene that responds to NF\u03baB and reduces inflammation by inhibiting NF\u03baB DNA binding activity (28). LncRNA responses are also critical for the functionality of dendritic cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (29\u201332). Thus, NEST lncRNA controls IFN\u03b3 locus in CD8+ T-cells leading to decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis (33, 34).",

            "text": "These studies illustrate the interest in identifying novel lncRNAs and elucidating their function and regulation. LncRNAs are thought to be at least as numerous as protein-coding genes, but only a few are well characterized (35\u201338). LncRNAs are transcripts similar to mRNAs but with poor coding potential. They are more cell type-specific, less expressed, and less well conserved than mRNAs (29, 39). Interestingly, lncRNAs are cell regulators that can function in cis, co-transcriptionally, or in trans. Some control the expression of coding genes located in the same genomic region. Therefore, the genomic location of lncRNAs can provide hints as to their functionality. They can be sense or antisense (when overlapping with one or more exons of another transcript in the same or in the opposite strand, respectively); intronic (when derived from an intron of another transcript); divergent or bidirectional (when they share a promoter with another transcript in the opposite strand and therefore are co-regulated); or intergenic (when they are independent, located in between two other genes). Several mechanisms are involved in the regulation of neighboring or antisense genes by lncRNAs. These include transcriptional activation or interference, recruitment of chromatin modifiers and remodelers, regulation of imprinting, editing, splicing or translation, and stability (40\u201344).",

In this analysis, we identified two lncRNAs upregulated in response to IFN in different cell lines. Interestingly, these lncRNAs are expressed from positions in the genome divergent from the well-characterized ISGs ISG15 and BST2. Therefore, we have called them lncISG15 and lncBST2. These lncRNAs and their coding counterparts are also induced in cells infected with mutants of influenza or vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) that fail to block the IFN response. Surprisingly, they are also induced in culture cells infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and in the liver of patients with HCV infections. Finally, according to HUGO regulation, we have renamed lncBST2 BISPR, from BST2 IFN-stimulated positive regulator, as we show that inhibition of lncBST2 expression by RNAi leads to decreased levels of BST2 mRNA, providing a new layer of regulation of the IFN response.",

Furthermore, 6 \u03bcl lipofectamine were mixed with 250 \u03bcl OPTIMEM media and incubated for 5 min. Then, lipofectamine and siRNA solutions were mixed and incubated for 20\u201360 min at room temperature. After incubation, half of the volume of the cell media was discarded and 300, 150, or 75 \u03bcl of the lipofectamine mixture were added to each well of 6, 12, or 24-well plates, respectively. Six hours post-transfection the media from the cells was discarded and substituted with DMEM media enriched with 10% FBS and antibiotics.",

VSV-eGFP titration was performed in quadruplicates on A549 cells. The supernatant from infected cells was collected and 1:10 serial dilutions were performed. Cells were seeded 24 h before infection in 96-well plates and infected with 50 \u03bcl of each dilution. Twenty-four hours after infection, GFP expression was visualized by microscopy and used to determine the titer. Cells were infected with HCV at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.3, with VSV at a moi of 5 and with a moi of 10 of Influenza A, \u0394NS1, Ad5, and SFV. In the case of the lytic viruses, we used a moi of 5 or 10 as this causes cytopathic effects at 24 h (for VSV, influenza and SFV) or 48 h (for Ad) in HuH7 or A549 cells. After infection, the virus was removed and fresh medium was added to the cells. Cells were harvested for RNA extraction at the indicated times post-infection.",

However, an array will only evaluate the expression levels of the transcripts that hybridize to probes spotted in the array. In the case of the lncRNAs, the array used only addresses the expression of 7419 regions described as long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). However, it has been estimated that there could be as many lncRNA genes as coding genes, and some authors consider that the number of lncRNAs could be as high as ~200000 (37, 38). Therefore, to achieve a more complete identification of lncRNAs that respond to IFN, we analyzed the transcriptome by RNASeq. RNA isolated from control cells or HuH7 cells treated with IFN as described, was sequenced after ribodepletion. Around 130 million reads were obtained per sample. Analysis was performed using a bioinformatic workflow that includes Tophat2 and Cufflinks 2 as described in the methods section. The analysis showed that, among the genes upregulated in response to IFN, there were several ISGs such as Mx1, ISG15, BST2, or members of the IFI and OAS families (Figure 1A and Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Ingenuity analysis showed that IFN signaling is a top canonical pathway (p = 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22123), the top upstream regulator is IFN\u03b12 (p = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22128), and cell signaling and infectious and inflammatory diseases are among the main functions.

A closer examination of their sequences indicated that they contained repetitive sequences or sequences similar to mitochondrial or ribosomal RNAs that could have led to an erroneous alignment of the RNASeq reads to the human genome. We believe that, even when the oligonucleotides used for amplification were specific, a partial homology to other sequences could allow cross-amplification and thus increased possibilities of misleading results.

Interestingly, database analysis showed that they are expressed from positions in the genome located close to ISG15 and BST2, both of which are well-characterized ISGs. This may have functional relevance as some lncRNAs have been described to regulate the expression of neighboring genes. Therefore, we originally named these lncRNAs after their neighbor, lncISG15 and lncBST2. Later, lncBST2 was renamed BISPR to follow HUGO regulations. When we evaluated the expression of these lncRNAs and their neighboring transcripts, we observed that both were strongly upregulated at early times in response to IFN (Figure 2A). Furthermore, they responded to IFN\u03b12 doses as low as 5 units/ml. These are similar levels to those found in the sera of some HCV patients (70). The induction was also observed at late times post-IFN-treatment. To evaluate further the robustness of the effect of IFN on these lncRNAs, we tested whether they also respond to IFN\u03bb, a type III IFN. HuH7 cells treated with IFN\u03bb for 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h also showed increased levels of lncISG15, lncBST2/BISPR, and their neighbors (Figure 2B).

The molecular mechanisms involved in this IFN blockade have been characterized for many viruses. Thus, for instance, NS1 protein from influenza virus and matrix protein from VSV are key factors in controlling IFN in infected cells (48\u201350, 71). We sought to check whether lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR were induced by the physiological IFN induced by an influenza virus that lacks NS1. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of these lncRNAs in cells infected with an influenza wild-type virus or a NS1 mutant. We also included cells infected with other RNA viruses such as SFV and HCV or DNA viruses such as adenovirus. All these viruses have developed mechanisms to block the cellular antiviral response and, with the exception of HCV, lead to a lytic infection. Different times post-infection were evaluated. The last point was collected when the cytopathic effect was apparent. This occurred at 24 h post-infection in the case of influenza and SFV or 48 h post-infection, in the case of adenovirus. HCV-infected cells were collected at 48 and 72 h post-infection. The results showed that at later times post-infection with the influenza virus lacking NS1, there was increased expression of lncISG15, lncBST2/BISPR, and their neighboring coding transcripts (Figure 3A). This increase was not observed in cells infected with wild-type influenza virus, or with other wild-type lytic viruses, suggesting that the induction may be mediated by IFN.",

After quantification of the RNA levels, we observed a significant increase in lncISG15, lncBST2/BISPR, ISG15, and BST2 in HCV-infected patients compared to controls (Figure 4A). With the number of patients evaluated, a significant correlation was not found between expression levels and infection with a particular genotype of HCV, presence of HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver cirrhosis, or with a particular cirrhosis stage. Therefore, there were no significantly different levels of these transcripts in HCV-infected livers without HCC compared with the peritumoral tissue of HCV-infected livers with HCC. Although most of the samples belong to patients that are still alive, no significant correlation was observed between the levels of the evaluated transcripts and survival post-diagnosis. Finally, we performed correlation studies to analyze whether in the patients, the expression level of lncISG15 or lncBST2/BISPR correlates significantly with the expression level of their neighboring coding genes.

Levels of BST2 and lncBST2/BISPR were also reduced in cells treated with siRNAs targeting STAT1 or by inhibition of IRF1, a transcription factor that acts downstream of IFN (data not shown). This indicates that BST2 and lncBST2/BISPR respond to STATs but also to other transcription factors induced by IFN. These results agree with the possibility that BST2 and lncBST2/BISPR share a bidirectional promoter.",

Treatment with ruxolitinib decreased the expression of ISG15 and lncISG15, but in the latter, this effect was only observed in A549 cells. No effect on ISG15 or lncISG15 expression was observed with a milder inhibition of STAT1 or inhibition of IRF1 using RNA interference (data not shown). Thus, although ISG15 is induced very rapidly after IFN-treatment, we do not observe a strong regulation of ISG15 or lncISG15 by the STAT pathway under the conditions used. In fact, it has been reported that a major regulator of ISG15 is IRF3, a transcription factor activated in response to PAMPs, but also a downstream effector of the IFN response (75).",

ORF Finder (NCBI) was used to determine all possible ORFs in these lncRNAs (Figure S4 in Supplementary Material). The analysis shows that all putative ORFs are shorter than 50 amino acids. Only two ORFs could be translated according to their poor susceptibility to nonsense mediated decay. However, these ORFs have non-consensus Kozak sequences at the initiation codon and therefore a poor coding capacity. Then, we evaluated the coding potential of lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR with the CPAT (63, 64) (Figure 6A). CPAT uses a model built with ORF size and coverage together with codon (Ficket score) and hexamer (hexamer score) usage bias. According to this program, lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR are non-coding as they have a coding probability of 0.001 and 0.064, respectively, much lower than 0.364, used as a threshold with the highest sensitivity and specificity to differentiate between coding and non-coding transcripts in humans (64). LncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR were also described as non-coding in LNCipedia (65). This lncRNA database shows that these lncRNAs are not found in the Pride archive, a database for proteomic data, or in lists of transcripts associated with ribosomes in ribosome profiling experiments (66\u201368). Further, lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR were also described as non-coding by the analysis of PhyloCSF, which uses multiple alignments to calculate the phylogenetic conservation score and determines whether a multi-species nucleotide sequence alignment is likely to represent a protein-coding region (69).",

Analysis of the RNASeq data shows that several of the upregulated genes are well-known coding ISGs such as ISG15 or OAS (Figure 1A, Table S3 in Supplementary Material). Ingenuity analysis confirms the enrichment of genes involved in the IFN response among the regulated factors. We have used RNAs from similar IFN-treated and control cells to hybridize expression arrays (15). Comparison of the datasets obtained in the analysis of the array and the RNASeq shows that only 13 coding genes were identified in both studies, including OAS, ISG15, Mx1, and some members of the IFI family. Generally, overlap between microarray and RNASeq analysis is not high (76). Furthermore, the overlapping decreases with sequencing depth and when low fold-changes or low abundance genes are analyzed. (77). This is because sequencing of low transcript abundances is characterized by high variance, which impedes their identification in RNASeq analysis. We believe that this may explain the poor correlation found between the array and the RNASeq datasets. In fact, we have determined by qRT-PCR that some IFN-related low abundance transcripts are detected only in the array analysis. These are early responders to IFN, which increased only marginally 3 days after IFN-treatment, when the analysis was performed. Therefore, we believe that some lncRNAs induced early post-IFN-treatment may have not been identified in our analysis. Interestingly, in the process of writing this manuscript, a paper was accepted describing the identification of IFN-induced lncRNAs by RNASeq in samples treated with IFN for short times (14). We believe that this study will be complementary to our work. Together, the datasets should contain lncRNAs regulated at early and later times post-IFN-treatment. Similarly, the lack of correlation between the microarray and RNAseq datasets also indicates that they can complement each other.",

Significant correlations also exist between these lncRNAs and other IFN-induced genes such as OAS, GBP1, or IRF1 (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material and data not shown). This may reflect the fact that all these genes are induced by IFN with a similar kinetics. In the case of the lncRNAs and their coding counterparts, correlation of the expression may result from their transcriptional co-regulation. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses indicate that BST2 and lncBST2/BISPR are bona fide ISGs strongly induced by the JAK/STAT pathway in response to IFN (Figure 5 and Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Furthermore, expression of BST2, ISG15, and their neighboring non-coding genes is induced by downstream effectors of the IFN response. These studies allow us to suggest that lncISG15/ISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR/BST2 may share bidirectional promoters.

Non-coding RNAs generated from bidirectional promoters may have functional roles that affect the bidirectional promoter, the neighboring protein-coding gene, or more distal genes (83). These effects could lead to activation or repression of the expression and could be mediated by either the transcription process itself or by the produced ncRNA transcript (84). In this study, we show that post-transcriptional inhibition of lncBST2/BISPR leads to reduced levels of BST2 mRNA (Figure 7). Therefore, lncBST2/BISPR should increase transcription or stability of its coding neighboring gene. Our results demonstrate that this regulation seems specific for BST2, as lncBST2/BISPR downregulation does not affect the expression of genes located nearby, which has been described for compact genomes (85). Moreover, inhibition of lncBST2/BISPR does not affect expression levels of other IFN-related genes such as ISG15 or GBP1 (Figure 7 and data not shown).",

BST2 is also named tetherin, as it inhibits viral budding by using anchors that trap virions on the cell membrane (86\u201388). Several enveloped viruses have been shown to be susceptible to the action of BST2/tetherin and have evolved to develop evasion strategies (87). Interestingly, HIV, influenza, HCV, and VSV are among the susceptible viruses and could be used to test the antiviral role of lncBST2/BISPR (49, 89\u201395). In fact, we show that lncBST2/BISPR and BST2 are induced after infection with HCV or influenza and VSV mutant viruses that activate the IFN response (Figure 3).",

            "text": "Upregulation of lncBST2/BISPR, lncISG15, and their coding neighbors was also observed in patients infected with HCV compared to controls (Figure 4). Similarly, a significant upregulation of lncBST2/BISPR and ISG15 was also detected in human T-lymphocytes infected with HIV compared to controls (data not shown). A non-significant increase in BST2 and lncISG15 was also observed in these samples. This leads to the possibility that interference with these factors could have therapeutic relevance. It is unclear why cells infected by these viruses, which employ several viral proteins to block the IFN pathway, show activation of these IFN response genes (96). In the case of HCV, it has been previously shown that patients with chronic HCV infections express ISGs, including high levels of ISG15 (97\u201399). In fact, HCV has evolved to use some ISGs for viral replication (100, 101). This is the case for ISG15. ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like protein that attaches to its targets in a process called ISGylation (102, 103). Protein ISGylation may result in increased or decreased functionality depending on the target (104). ISG15 preferentially conjugates newly synthesized proteins affecting more strongly viral proteins or cellular proteins translated into IFN-induced cells (105). Viruses such as influenza, HIV, or VSV are susceptible to the action of ISG15 (103, 106). In the case of HCV, a pro-HCV role for ISG15 has been reported (105, 107). ISG15 has been shown to negatively regulate RIG-I and thus to inhibit the signaling process leading to IFN induction that affects HCV replication (108). Furthermore, ISG15 expression in the liver of chronically infected patients is considered a negative predictive biomarker of the ability of the patients to respond to IFN therapy (97\u201399) (Figure 4). In our study, we cannot address whether lncISG15, BST2, or lncBST2/BISPR are markers for the susceptibility of HCV patients to respond to IFN-treatment, as the HCV patients that we have studied are non-responders to IFN.",

Two transcripts have been evaluated for lncBST2/BISPR. lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR have a coding probability and a coding label of \u201cnon-coding RNAs\u201d according to these analyses. \u201cLists\u201d indicated the number of times that these transcripts have been found in the pride archive or in lists containing ribosome-associated RNAs published by Lee or Bazzini. See the text for other details. (B) Subcellular localization of lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR. HuH7 cells were mock-treated or treated with 10000 units/ml of IFN\u03b12 and divided into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. RNA was isolated from each fraction and used to evaluate the expression levels of lncISG15 and lncBST2/BISPR by qRT-PCR. MALAT1, GAPDH, and ISG15 mRNA was also quantified and used as a reference to calculate the relative levels of each transcript and as a control to evaluate the subcellular fractionation. The ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear levels is shown. The experiment was performed three times and each value shows the average of three replicas from a representative experiment.
