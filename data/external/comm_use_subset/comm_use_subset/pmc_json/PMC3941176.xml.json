The genetic profile of the virus consists of 13,350 nucleotides, comprising the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), matrix proteins (M2-1 and M2-2), small hydrophobic protein (SH), glycoprotein (G), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [3]. The fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins are the major HMPV surface glycoproteins. The HMPV F gene codes for a class 1 viral fusion protein that mediates virus entry through both attachment [4] and fusion with the host cell membrane [5]. The HMPV F protein is a major antigenic determinant which mediates extensive cross-lineage neutralization and protection. Infection with each strain provided a high level of resistance to reinfection with the homologous or heterologous strain [6]. The F gene is relatively conserved between subgroups, making it an ideal target for nucleic acid amplification [7].",

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on Egyptian HMPV sequences of 439 nt of the F gene. At present, HMPV is differentiated into subgroups A and B, each with two genetic lineages A1, A2, B1, and B2, respectively. All the Egyptian HMPV sequences clustered in subgroup B (Figure 3). Of the 24 Egyptian sequences 3 belonged to lineage B1 and 21 to lineage B2. Thus, 3 patients (15%) were infected with HMPV of lineage B1 and 17 patients (85%) were infected with HMPV of the lineage B2. There were Egyptian HMPV sequences identical (GER/3379/10, GER/0562/08) or closely related (GER/0394/06, GER/0259/08, and GER/0043/08) to sequences from Germany. Further, the Egyptian sequences clustered in batches of nearly identical (lineage B1) or identical (in lineage B2) sequences. HMPV sequences EG/303(NA)/08 and EG/513(TS)/08 of lineage B2 clustered separately from the other Egyptian sequences of the same lineage. These sequences were detected in patients resident in Red Sea and Luxor.",

The higher infection rate of HMPV in children supports the hypothesis that HMPV is a leading cause of respiratory tract infection in the first years of life [44]. In general, the HMPV frequency rate varies worldwide from 3.5% in Finland to 17.8% in Brazil [45\u201350]. Altogether, the frequency of HMPV varies from year to year in a given region depending on the geographical locations, and furthermore the positive rate alters due to different methods of sample collection and variation of calculation methods [43, 51].",

In line with these findings, the F gene was well conserved in HMPV circulating in Europe, North America, and Asia [8, 18, 31, 59\u201361] (Table 5). The amino acid conservation of the F gene was higher in the Egyptian strains than nucleotide sequence conservation. This is supported by the assumption that nucleotide diversity is greater than amino acid diversity among HMPV F sequences due to functional constraints on fusion proteins which prevent drastic amino acid changes. This could lead to a lack of directional antigenic drift in paramyxoviruses in contrast to influenza viruses [62].",

The Egyptian HMPV strains formed three clusters, two in the B2 branch and one in the B1 branch. In regard of the amino acid substitution, it was revealed that B2 strains were more variable than B1 strains. Two Egyptian HMPV (EG/303(NA)/08 and EG/513(TS)/08) showed a unique amino acid substitution in the F gene resulting in an allocation of these strains to a separate branch from B2 viruses. These viruses were detected in two patients from Red Sea and Luxor. Interestingly, there were Egyptian and German HMPV strains which were very closely related. The relation of HMPV from distant regions is known but reasons remain unclear. It can be supposed that human travelling behaviour influences the diversity and evolution of HMPV.",
