A previous, similar study [1] used the same methodology to examine ARI in 2011\u20132012. Because the onset, severity and length of the influenza season vary year to year, the present study differs in its epidemiology and its focus on viral co-detections.",

Participants were divided into three age groups \u2013 children (6 months-17 years), young adults (18\u201349 years) and older adults (\u226550 years). Bivariate multinomial regression models assessed the association of patient characteristics with the MRT-PCRs. The dependent variable was the virus group and the independent variables were the participants\u2019 personal characteristics. Logistic regression models assessed the association of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics with virus type (single virus infection vs. co-detection). For discrete outcome measures with more than two levels, multinomial logistic regression models were used. One way analysis of variance was used for continuous outcomes. For time-to-event outcomes, Kaplan-Meier curves estimated the cumulative proportion of normal activity. Log rank tests were used to test for differences in the cumulative proportions among the virus groups. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were made with a Bonferroni correction (p value < 0.05/15 indicating statistical significance). Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC).",

This panel of viruses includes four CoVs and four PIVs that are not part of the currently (2015) FDA-cleared format. Study limitations include the inability to test an inclusive sample of all of the ARI specimens with the MRT-PCR and the fact that health-seeking behavior during illness is associated with a history of influenza vaccination. The sample size of detected viruses other than influenza, HRV, RSV and coronaviruses were too small for sub-analyses. However, the sample size overall was sufficient to allow confidence in the relationships between characteristics of ARI cases and the viruses associated with them during this time period. Additionally, the viral panel does not contain bacteria, mycoplasma, and all possible respiratory viruses. Sampling took place during the influenza season and may have missed peak seasons for other virus circulation. The study is strengthened by the similarity of methods used in a previous influenza season and allows for comparison of viral activity in two seasons with different influenza epidemiology.",
