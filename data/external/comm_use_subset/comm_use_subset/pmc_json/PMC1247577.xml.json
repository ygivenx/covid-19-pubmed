Also, many previous studies have been retrospective in design and thus have been forced to estimate past exposures from limited and sometimes biased historical data.",

Exposure histories and biologic samples will be obtained during pregnancy and from children as they grow, obviating the need for retrospective assessments of exposures. The large sample size will facilitate simultaneous examination of the effects of multiple chemical exposures, of interactions among them, and of interactions among biologic, chemical, behavioral, and social factors. Each child will be screened genetically, thus permitting study of gene\u2013environment interactions. Follow-up will extend over decades. For the past four years, working groups convened by NICHD have been developing the NCS: formulating core hypotheses, delineating research protocols, and planning logistics. The study is now ready for the field.",

The Framingham Heart Study (Framingham, MA), for example, was established in 1948 at a time when heart disease and stroke were epidemic in the United States. The goal was to identify preventable risk factors. Within a few years, data from Framingham identified cigarette smoking (Dawber 1960) and elevated cholesterol and hypertension as preventable causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Kannel et al. 1961, 1978); later analyses elucidated the role of elevated triglycerides, sedentary lifestyle, and diabetes. This information provided the blueprint for the major reductions in incidence of CVD that we have achieved in the United States over the past four decades (CDC 1999).",

But now to move the study forward, there is need in 2005 to establish a data-coordinating center, a repository for secure storage of biologic samples, and a series of regionally distributed vanguard recruitment sites. For these tasks, NICHD needs $15 million in new dollars above their regular budget. Without at least $27 million in federal funding in 2005, NICHD will likely be forced to cancel or at least postpone the study.",
