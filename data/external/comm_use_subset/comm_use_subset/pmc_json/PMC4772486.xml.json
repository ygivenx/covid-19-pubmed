Correspondingly, the spreading process of SARS was divided into five stages. Then, by random simulation, we found that the spreading of SARS has a fifteen-day time delay.

In the initial stage of the SARS process, from March 20 to April 8, according to the above analysis, , and , based on these, the average number of infected cases of each day was simulated. See Fig. 5(a) for an illustration. It is clear that the random variation of the infected number has an incremental trend and that implies that the disease would infect a large amount of persons. Then from April 9 to April 19, during the second stage of SARS, some protective measures were taken with the understanding of the disease, so parameters changed to , and . By simulation, we found that the infected number changes chaotically as in Fig. 5(b). With the time going by, from April 20 to May 4, the severity of the disease gradually being known, more protective measures were taken and parameters reduced further to , and . In this stage, the simulation revealed that the average infected number of each day fluctuates with a trend of decline and it would be zero after a period, which predicates the infectious disease can be controlled without any additional measures (Fig. 5(c)). In fact, by simulating the percolation, we acquire  in the initial stage,  in the second stage, and  in the third stage, i.e., the initial stage is a supercritical phase of the spread of SARS, the second stage is a critical phase, and the third stage is a subcritical phase, which agrees with the simulation. We could conclude that, near the critical point, slightly adjusting of the system parameters would cause a fundamental change of the trend of infectious diseases. Therefore, in order control the large-scale outbreak of the disease, we must try our best to make , even if the infection probability is only a little smaller than the critical infection probability.
