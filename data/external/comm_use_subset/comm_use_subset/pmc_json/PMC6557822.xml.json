Since the introduction of metronidazole for the treatment of amoebiasis, few other treatments have been developed.

            "text": "On the other hand, in recent years the interest in designing and synthetizing new antiparasitic molecules has been renewed, facilitated by the application of in silico docking; by using such techniques several research groups have investigated newly synthetized molecules as potential antiprotozoal compounds, reporting active molecules against E. histolytica and other protozoa11,12. An example of these bioactive compounds are T-001, T-011, and T-016 (Table 1), which are quinoxaline-7-carboxylate 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives11, and were used in the present work to validate the model reported here. Although the aforementioned compounds possess in vitro activity against E. histolytica, tissue-acting drugs are required to treat invasive amoebiasis, which usually are evaluated in either in vitro and/or in vivo models. Although in vivo models have contributed significantly to the study of amoebiasis, there is no animal model that mimics the whole cycle of the human disease13. For most in vitro studies, axenic cultures of E. histolytica are used14,15. However, it has been reported that long-term axenic cultivation has a profound effect on E. histolytica virulence and several virulence markers, and culture conditions induce a strong selective pressure on E. histolytica, since amoebic virulence can vary from zero to its highest grade, or vice versa16. Also, in vitro cultures lack complex interactions between stroma components and different cell types that contribute to amoeba pathogenesis in animals. Regarding the latter, ex vivo cultures of precision-cut intestinal and hepatic slices represent alternative 3D models that contain all of the cell types belonging to the tissue from which they were obtained, and are therefore considered as mini-organs. Slices have many advantages over in vitro and in vivo systems, i.e. they retain their metabolic and transport capacity among others17. In previous papers, our group reported that hamster liver slices infected with E. histolytica represent an ex vivo 3D model to study hepatic amoebiasis based on morphological and molecular characterization of the disease ex vivo18,19. In these studies, we observed that morphologic characteristics in amoebae were conserved at the evaluated experimental times, as were eritophagocytic activity, immune response reaction, and virulence factors induction. Furthermore, Bansal et al.20 reported human colon explants to analyze amoebic virulence factors and reproduce the intestinal invasion by E. histolytica as well as the tissue non-response to E. dispar, a non-pathogenic species. Similarly, Girard-Misguich et al.21 utilized porcine colonic explants, derived from miniature histocompatible SLAd/d piglets, to co-culture with virulent (HM1:IMSS) and avirulent (Rahman) strains of E. histolytica. They were able to observe the tissue invasion by the trophozoites and the typical innate immune response, similarly to the report on human colon explants. Likewise, Ximenez et al.22 evaluated genes related to the pathogenicity and E. histolytica survival, and genes linked to the immune response in precision cut liver slices from human tissue. The afore mentioned studies and the present work differ between them in the origin of the tissue employed (hamster, pig or human), explant preparation methodology (manual or semiautomatic), culture media, amoeba strains (virulent/avirulent), trophozoite inocula, and evaluated genes (host or parasite genes).",

Animal models also have been used for the study of amoebiasis, however they have the disadvantage that is not possible to induce both intestinal and hepatic lesions in the same animal host13. Since E. histolytica only infects humans and non-human primates, results obtained in in vivo studies with laboratory animals cannot always be translated directly to humans.

Results using liver slices infected with amoebae in the currently study are identical to those obtained in our previous work18,19. We also validated intestinal and hepatic slices as experimental infection models using compounds with known anti-amoebic activity. In the current study, intestinal slices were cultured up to 9 h in the presence of the amoebae (12 h of incubation in total). Other investigators have reported maintenance of intestinal slice viability during similar culture periods. For example, de Kanter et al.43, and van de Kerkhof et al.44 reported maintenance of viability and metabolic activity up to 3 h of culturing. Two hours of incubation was used to analyze the interaction of xenobiotic agents with transporting proteins in the intestine45. Other authors have shown that small and large intestine slices remain viable for 8 and 24 h respectively when the intracellular ATP content was evaluated, while after 24 h most of the phase I and II enzymes implicated in metabolic transformation show significant changes depending on the origin of the tissue46. The incubation time over which tissue slices remain viable depends on the tissue, where 96 and 24 h are suitable for liver slices and intestinal slices respectively47. In general terms, we were able to observe the typical lesions of the amoebic disease during the ex vivo infection of both PCLS and PCIS. Incubation during longer times with the virulent strain of E. histolytica caused massive destruction of both tissues due to the amoebae infection.",

Since Vero cells are useful to select those compounds that can be further tested or characterized in more complex systems, we found that the concentrations used in our tests were not harmful in vitro (IC50 > 100 \u00b5M). One of the compounds, T-011, showed in vitro cytotoxicity at a concentration of 5.86 \u00b5M, however to decrease the cytotoxic effect, the concentration of this compound may be reduced since the IC50 value vs E. histolytica is 0.35 \u00b5M.",

In the same way, Bansal et al.20 reported the presence of monocytes and T-lymphocytes within the lamina propria of colonic explants, as well as the recruitment and migration of neutrophils and other resident immune cells to the site of infection which contributed to the immune response in intestine explants.

In addition, intracryptic abscesses were observed at 9 h of incubation. These changes are similar to those reported by Houpt et al.53 in C3H/Hej mice infected with E. histolytica; they also observed viable amoebae in areas of epithelial ulceration and severe inflammation as reflected by the presence of plasma cells, neutrophils, and mast cells. Likewise, E. histolytica trophozoites degraded the intestinal epithelium and penetrated the mucosa of human intestine explants after 7 h of incubation54,55. In addition, Bansal et al.20 reported that trophozoites reach the epithelial surface and remove the mucosa, detaching the enterocytes and migrating along the crypts. These results are similar to those obtained in the present work. Indeed, the same microscopic changes were described in both in vivo and ex vivo models since 1970 by Prathap and Gilman, and by Espinosa-Cantellano and Mart\u00ednez-Palomo for human amoebic ulcerative colitis56. Our results lead us to believe that the experimental model of intestinal and hepatic tissue slices can be a valuable tool to predict the effect of anti-amoebic compounds in the early stages of E. histolytica infection. Although tissue slices have been well accepted for xenobiotic toxicity and metabolism studies57,58, as well as models for ex vivo infection with viruses59,60, bacteria39, and parasites20,61, the present work represents the first report of the in situ effect of compounds with anti-amoebic properties on the progression of infection by E. histolytica in organotypic culture of both, hepatic and intestinal tissues derived from the same animal. Therefore, a significant reduction of biological variability into the experimental repetitions due to the biological responses between animals and even within the same animal is possible62.",

Given that ALT and AST enzymes are considered as sensitive biochemical indicators of cellular injury and metabolic disturbances65 we determined both enzyme levels on the hepatic slices treated with the synthetic compounds and metronidazole. Increased levels of ALT and AST enzymes indicate a toxicological effect of the tested compounds66, therefore, their increase in tissues treated with T-011 confirm the cytotoxicity found on Vero cells (IC50 = 5.86 \u00b5M) and their lower selectivity (SI 16.74) compared to tissues treated with T-001 and T-016, which are not toxic to Vero cells and exhibited higher selectivity (SI > 65). Also, T-011 Induced more pathological changes at histologic level. T-001 and T-016 induced less inflammation and necrosis, and raised one of the two hepatic enzymes. Nevertheless, compared to metronidazole, the three compounds were significantly less toxic in tissue cultures at the used concentrations.",

The latter may explain the discrepancies observed between in vitro studies and 3D models, as in the present work where the active compounds showed a modest cytotoxic effect on the intestine and liver slices at much lower concentrations than where cytotoxicity was seen in the cell line. Similarly, van de Kerkhof et al.51 showed a high metabolic rate in intestinal tissue slices that can be up to 3 times higher than that estimated in hepatocytes in liver tissue slices.",

The most remarkable morphologic change is the ulceration of the mucosa as a consequence of the infection process; morphologically well conserved amoebae (arrows) are in close contact with epithelial cells (*) and are able to induce a severe acute inflammatory process composed mainly by neutrophils and eosinophils (dotted area in Fig. d).
