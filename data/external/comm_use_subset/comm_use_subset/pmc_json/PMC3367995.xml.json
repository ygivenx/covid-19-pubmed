In early 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm), a novel influenza A H1N1 strain of swine-origin, emerged from Mexico and rapidly spread worldwide [2]. Although the pandemic period of H1N1pdm has now passed [3], H1N1pdm remains a dominant circulating influenza strain in various parts of the world.",

However, a subset of cases have been characterized by serious illness, often requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilator support [2], [6], [8], [9]. Common complications in such severe cases of H1N1pdm infection have included: severe hypoxemia, shock, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2], [8], [9]. Nonpulmonary acute organ dysfunction has also been reported [9], [10].

IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine significantly implicated in various facets of the immune response, including a prominent role in inflammation. IL-6 is the chief mediator of the acute phase response and fever [14]. IL-6 also has important involvement in many pathogenic inflammatory states: IL-6 levels are elevated and correlate with sepsis severity and mortality [15] and IL-6 has been implicated in the cytokine storm following avian influenza A H5N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection [16]\u2013[18]. In contrast, studies have also shown that IL-6 may play roles in regulating and limiting inflammation, with mice deficient for IL-6 displaying more pronounced inflammation and neutrophilia in response to aerosolized endotoxin [19]. Within the context of the lung, IL-6 promotes pulmonary inflammation and IL-6 levels correlate with severity and mortality of ARDS [20], [21].",

Recently, increased IL-6 expression was observed in severe cases of H1N1pdm infection, with a significant inverse association between IL-6 and arterial oxygen levels in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection [25]. Given the known involvement of IL-6 in pathogenic lung inflammation, we sought to investigate the role of IL-6 in severe H1N1pdm infection, and potential contributions to disease. Here, we report increased IL-6 expression in both humans hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection and in multiple mice strains infected with H1N1pdm (A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm)), which implicated IL-6 in the host response to H1N1pdm infection. We then explored the effect of IL-6 deficiency on disease in H1N1pdm infected IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice. Our results indicated that IL-6 expression was strongly associated with disease severity although loss of IL-6 did not alter disease outcome in mice. This suggested IL-6 as a marker of severe influenza H1N1pdm disease but not a potential therapeutic target which has important implications on the design and administration of influenza A therapeutics.",

A total of 45 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm infection were included in our analysis.

IL-6 concentrations were found to be significantly higher in patients who required critical care support (n = 35) compared to patients who did not (n = 10) (Figure 1A).

This preceded upregulation of Il6, of which expression plateaued only by day 3 pi. IL-6 inducible negative regulator of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (Socs1), was upregulated late following infection, at day 6 pi.

Visual representation of the IL-6 signalling pathway reported by IPA at day 3 pi revealed upregulation of the JAK-STAT3 axis of IL-6 signalling, while the extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (ERK)-mediated axis was downregulated (Figure 3Bii). Complementary analysis of Il6, Stat3, and Il6ra gene expression by qRT-PCR similarly identified peak upregulation of Stat3 and Il6ra early at day 2 pi, and persistent upregulation of Il6 throughout infection (Figure 3C).

To determine if IL-6 expression following H1N1pdm infection was dependent on the genetic background of the host, we investigated IL-6 levels in three mouse strains infected with H1N1pdm: C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and B6129SF2/J. Previously, Otte et al. reported that BALB/cJ mice were less susceptible than C57BL/6J mice to H1N1pdm infection and speculated that this may be due to dampened cytokine expression in C57BL/6J mice [26]. In contrast, we found that C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice were similarly susceptible to A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) infection. No statistically significant differences in disease severity were observed based on survival, weight loss, or lung viral load, although B6129SF2/J mouse final percent survival (0%) was markedly lower than that observed in C57BL/6J (36.4%) and BALB/cJ (18.2%) mice. Additional experiments, such as LD50 studies, may reveal significant differences in survival between mouse strains and clarify the potential genetic determinants of disease severity. Marked upregulation of IL-6 expression, both at the RNA and protein levels, was observed in mice of all three genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, we found C57BL/6J mice to be the strongest IL-6 producers while BALB/cJ mice were the weakest, suggesting cytokine responses may not have been dampened in C57BL/6J mice. Serum IL-6 protein levels were significantly higher in C57BL/6J mice than in BALB/cJ mice. No other differences were statistically significant but larger studies may further resolve differences in IL-6 responses between mouse strains. In summary, we found from our strain comparison studies that all three mouse strains had similar virus susceptibility, disease severity as well as induced levels of IL-6. Our findings implicated IL-6 in the host response to H1N1pdm in mice and also suggested C57BL/6J mice to be a suitable genetic background for IL-6 studies.",

Since differences in infection dose could alter gene expression profiles in infected mice, we also investigated gene expression by real-time PCR for mice infected with 104 EID50.

With this conclusion in mind, it is possible that dampened cytokine responses in C57BL/6J mice could minimize the role of hypercytokinemia during H1N1pdm infection. IL-6 deficiency in C57BL/6J background may not have affected survival and/or disease severity where it would have in another mouse background. Furthermore, C57BL/6J mice are predisposed to Th1-type immune responses whereas BALB/cJ mice are predisposed to Th-2 type immune responses. Although IL-6 deficiency had no effect in Th1-type skewed C57BL/6J mice, the role of IL-6 could be significantly different in Th2-type skewed BALB/cJ mice. It is important that future studies investigate IL-6 deficiency in other mouse strains to determine what impact host genetic background has on the protective or pathogenic roles of IL-6.",

Among critically ill patients, we also observed a trend of increased IL-6 in nonsurvivors compared to survivors. Similarly, we detected increased IL-6 levels in H1N1pdm-infected mice, which was associated with disease pathogenesis. Interestingly, BALB/cJ mice were the weakest producers of IL-6. While we observed no statistical differences in disease severity between mouse strains, Otte et al. reported milder disease in BALB/cJ mice. Taken together, these studies may suggest IL-6 to be an indicator of disease severity in mice, as we observed in human patients. IL-6 deficiency did not impact disease outcome in C57BL/6J mice, but the consistent association of IL-6 with severe disease suggests host response elements that contribute to disease may be regulated by a common upstream event which also governs the IL-6 associated inflammatory response. Thus, IL-6 may serve as a potential disease severity biomarker during H1N1pdm infection, as IL-6 has been shown to be a biomarker in other diseases [15], [42]. Further investigation is critical to elucidate the role of IL-6 as a disease severity marker in influenza, specifically severe H1N1pdm.",

Viral load in lung homogenates of IL-6\u2212/\u2212 and IL-6 wild-type mice. Lung tissue collected at day 3 pi. n = 3 for IL-6\u2212/\u2212 mice and n = 3 for IL-6 wild-type mice. Vertical error bars indicate +1 standard deviation. The two-tailed, two-sample unequal variances Student\u2019s t-test was used to ascertain significance. Viral load expressed in log10 (B). Lung histology collected from IL-6 wild-type and IL-6\u2212/\u2212. Samples collected at both day 3 and day 6 pi (C).",
