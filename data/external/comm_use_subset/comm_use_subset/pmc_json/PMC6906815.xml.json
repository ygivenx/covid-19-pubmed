The patients were travelling from a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic area, and some of the patients had respiratory symptoms. According to the literature, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms may be prodromal symptoms in some MERS cases [2\u20134]. The receiving hospital suspected that the patients were infected with MERS and immediately reported it. After receiving the report, an investigation team was immediately sent to conduct an epidemiological investigation and collect specimens at the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The body temperature of all the passengers on the flight was measured. Medical observations of all the passengers were conducted. The passengers on the flight that did not contain members of the tour group had no fever symptoms. The investigation revealed that the patients were all part of a tour group that had travelled to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The nontour group did not present disease symptoms. The travel dates were from May 4 to May 10.",

According to reports in the literature, over 125,000 deaths (3.6% of total deaths) in the Eastern Mediterranean region in 2013 were due to diarrheal diseases, with a greater burden of diarrheal diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Diarrhea-associated deaths per 100,000 children under 5 years of age ranged from one (95% uncertainty interval (UI) = 0-1) in Bahrain and Oman to 471 (95% UI = 245\u2013763) in Somalia [14].

With the acceleration of globalization, the exchanges between people in various countries have gradually increased, and food poisoning is spreading quickly across borders. To prevent and control infectious diseases, it is important to promote information exchange in the field of infectious diseases globally.
