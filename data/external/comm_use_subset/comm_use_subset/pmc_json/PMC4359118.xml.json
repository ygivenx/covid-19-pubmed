Pork production is expected to decline around 6\u20137% in 2014 due to a decrease in the number of hogs that may range from 3 to 11%.[2,3] The devastating effect of PEDv is mainly due to the acute watery diarrhea induced in infected pigs, which may lead to a high (50\u201380%) mortality, particularly in neonatal piglets.[4] In many sow farms, it may take at least 12 weeks to recover to the baseline piglet production level.[5] However, if piglets survive the first seven days after infection, their chance of survival increase.[6] The impact of PEDv infection in subsequent production stages (i.e., post-weaning/ growing and finishing pigs) of pigs surviving the first contact with PEDv has not been reported.",

The database included all batches of animals produced in all farms from the company, located in the Midwest. All sows and boars were cross bred, commercial genetics. All pigs were vaccinated for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, porcine circovirus (PCV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PCV was present in all farms while PRRS virus (PRRSv) was occasionally detected in a proportion of them (see below). Collected data included information on the site in which pigs were located, site production type (nursery or wean to finish (WF)), pig source (sow farm from which pigs originated), start and close period on each site, number of pigs per batch, mortality (defined by percentage of total pigs started), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion (FCR), and status of the sow farm from which pigs were weaned for PRRS and PED. Because weaned pigs from different sow farms were sometimes commingled in the subsequent growing stages, the term \u201cflow\u201d is used to refer to the origin of a given pig batch (and may include one or more single sow farms). Only flows in which PED was detected (based on diagnostic investigation including clinical signs and PCR detection of PEDv) during the period of study were selected. The identity of the data provider cannot be disclosed due to legal restrictions, but all relevant information underlying the analyses presented here are contained in the text and S1 Dataset.",

Records were screened to identify PED-positive flows, and, for each PED-positive flow, the first PED positive batch (infected group) and the preceding batch (control group), that had to precede the infected group by more than 14 but less than 120 days. For flows with more than one sow farm, only batches with the same combination of sow farms were paired. Candidate control batches leaving sow farms within the first two weeks before the PED-infected batch were excluded from the analysis in an effort to have high specificity for the \u201ccontrol batches\u201d. Target parameters (mortality, ADG, ADFI, and FCR) of infected and control groups were compared using the Wilcoxon test, and differences observed in nursery and WF pairs were compared using a Mann-Whitney test.",

However, although mortality in piglets may be as high as 80% in the first days of the outbreak, sow farms may return to their baseline production within 13 weeks, although reaching 100% of the baseline production may take longer [5]. In addition, PEDv infection may have an effect in surviving piglets that may impair their future performance and, therefore, increase the economic burden caused by PEDv infection; still, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, this hypothesis has not been tested yet. In the present study we compared the performance of pigs produced in 18 different flows before and just after diagnosis of PED in the sow farms in a first attempt to detect the impact of PEDv infection in growing pigs.",

The impact of PED on the mortality of the first positive weaned batches was evident, since more than half of the 18 case batches having mortalities above 10% (Table 1). Use of mortality as an indicator of performance of growing pigs is impaired by the limited number of studies focused on defining baseline levels in grow-finish pigs.[10] Indeed, the variation observed in the batches produced before the PEDv outbreak in the flows under study likely reflects the impact of other variables (such as coinfection with other pathogens, or certain stressors or management practices) not captured in the analysis. Still, the absence of a visible trend in the mortality in a four month period supports the suitability of the selection of the control pair among batches produced within those 120 days, as all were considered to belong to the same population. Even with the limited sample size analyzed here, differences in mortality evidenced by the comparison of the paired values were enough to reach statistical significance, with a mean increase of at least 10% and 13 of 18 pairs displaying a difference above 5% (Table 1, Fig. 1). Three of the four pairs in which the control batch was weaned between 60\u2013120 days before the infected batch displayed smaller differences than the rest of the data points (Fig. 1). Two of these flows had weaned other pigs between the infected and control batches that had been commingled with pigs from other sow farms, with mortality rates in these \u201cintermediate batches\u201d above 10% in all batches. However they could not be included in this study due to the lack of a suitable control pair for them (animals from the same sow farms that were PED negative within the previous 14\u2013120 days). Therefore, our results would suggest that mortality in batches that were weaned several weeks after PEDv infected the sow farm was more similar to pre-PEDv mortality, and that the increase due to PEDv in the first pigs weaned after the outbreak may be even higher than estimated here.",

Such analytical procedure increased the homogeneity of the compared infected- and control-populations, in terms of breed, management and disease prevention procedures at the sow farm, thus accounting for their effect as possible confounders affecting mortality.[10,11] Data from WF and nursery batches were analyzed separately, but the fact that the period on feed for most of the WF pigs (only three PED- and one PED+ batch stayed >150 days) indicated that the study period in which performance was measured was very similar regardless of productive type of the site in which pigs were placed. Still, data were presented separately for both sites due to other management related factors that may differentiate WF and nursery sites, such as size of barns, floor, feeders, and that could have an impact, as suggested by the differences observed in the pre-PEDv batches). Infection with other pathogens could also increase mortality, and PRRSv was detected in four of the 18 flows before the PED outbreak, and in four case batches compared with one control batch. Still, among those three pairs in which only the case batch was positive (flows O, P and Q), difference in case-control mortality was less than 3% in two cases (Table 1), suggesting that PRRS was not a significant factor in the overall trend observed across flows. Moreover, the mean difference between the mortality recorded in case and control batches from the four flows affected with PRRS within the four months before the PED outbreak was lower than that observed in flows in which PRRSv was not detected throughout the whole study (8.7% and 14.2%, respectively).",

The location in which the pigs stayed during the period in which mortality was measured would undoubtedly influence this parameter. However, provided that weaned pigs were shipped to the different sites depending on the production needs and capacities and not depending on the PED status of the sow farm at that time, the \u201csite effect\u201d likely affected infected- and control-batches similarly, and for that reason, the authors do not think that such effect has affected the results reported here. As with any other observational study, causality cannot be demonstrated and for that reason, it is unclear if the higher mortality in PED+ batches was due to PEDv infection alone. However, we are not aware of any epidemiological factor that could increase mortality and that was significantly more prevalent in PED+ batches compared with PED- batches. For this reason, we believe that the most biologically sound explanation for the significantly poorer performance observed in PED+ batches was the infection with the virus.",

            "text": "Mortality can be directly recorded by swine barn managers and is related with profitability of swine operations.[10] This makes it an attractive target to evaluate the importance of PEDv in growing pigs. However, ADG. ADFI and FCR are also basic indicators of performance usually recorded in growing pigs.[7] Our data reveal that ADG was significantly lower in PED-positive compared with PED-negative batches, whereas ADFI remained unaltered (Table 1), thus yielding a mean increase in the FCR of 0.55. Assuming that the feed costs associated to produce a 40 lb feeder pig is 11.47$/head (mean estimate for December 2013\u2013June 2014, [12]), our results would suggest a mean increase of the cost of each lb. of pig of around 16 cents due to the increased feed costs only. Variability in these parameters within the four months before the outbreak was larger than in the case of mortality, as shown for FCR in Fig. 1, therefore suggesting that these results should be interpreted carefully given the limited sample size. Still, comparison of paired values revealed a consistent trend towards a poorer performance of pigs from case batches (Fig. 3a and 3b). This suggests that while clinical signs of diarrhea can be mild in growing pigs, the negative consequence on performance is important. In summary, our results demonstrate that mortality, ADG and FCR recorded in growing pigs (mean ages 23\u201390 days) were significantly poorer from those observed in pigs weaned 14 to 120 days before the introduction of PED. This is the first reported description of the effect of PEDv infection in performance of growing pigs that survive the infection at the sow farm.",
