            "text": "Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [1]. Like other flaviviruses including dengue virus, West Nile virus, and Zika virus, JEV genome has an only open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein consisting of structural proteins (capsid (C), membrane (prM/M), and envelope (E)) and non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [2,3]. C protein contains positively charged residues, enabling to bind viral RNA and form a ribonucleoprotein complex [4]. The signal peptide of prM/M protein is sliced by a cell protease during maturation [5]. E protein (E) is responsible for virus attachment and membrane fusion and is also the crucial antigen to inducing neutralizing antibodies [6,7]. Non-structural proteins NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, are responsible for viral replication [1,2,3]. NS1 protein is associated with the initial negative-strand RNA synthesis in the early stage replication, secreted to modulate the host immune response [8,9]. NS2A is a membrane associated protein that participates in virus replication and assembly [10]. NS2B is a co-factor to activate the proteolytic activity of NS3 protein, which contains protease, helicase, and NTPase domains [11,12]. A hydrophobic protein NS4A is also related to viral replication [13]. NS4B and NS5 can block interferon signaling [14]; moreover, NS5 is recognized as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase [15]. JEV infection might lead to developing permanent neurologic or psychiatric sequelae, including memory loss, behavior disturbances, impaired cognition, convulsions and paralysis, and severe central nervous system damage [16]. JEV is predominant in Southeast Asia and East Asia due to the distribution of Culex species. Although inactivated JEV genotype III vaccines have been invented and introduced in many countries, more than 30,000 JE cases including 10,000 deaths are annually reported in these areas [17]. Recently, genotype I JEV has appeared in Vietnam, Taiwan, China, and Korea, potentially becoming the predominant genotype in these countries [1,18]. Noticeably, the inactivated JEV genotype III vaccine elicited a low protective immunity against the JEV genotype I [19]. Nowadays, there is still not an effective treatment yet for JE cases; the rapid and rational screening platforms are necessary for efficiently developing anti-JEV agents.",

            "text": "Replicons of positive-strand RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, coronavirus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and JEV are used to screen antiviral compounds and examine antiviral mechanisms [20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Replicons contain a partial genome, including cis-acting elements in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends as well as the genes of all non-structural proteins under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter. The CMV promoter driven viral RNA subgenomes enable self-replication in transfected cells but have no infectious particles [27,28]. Moreover, reporter genes like green fluorescent protein (GFP) and firefly luciferase are in-frame cloned into viral subgenomes in the replicons, and quantitative analysis of the reporter expression becomes a measurable assay to monitor the virus replication. DNA-launched replicons are more convenient than RNA-launched replicons required producing viral RNA subgenomes using in vitro transcription assays [29]. Because they are lacking the structure protein coding region, both types of virus replicons transiently self-replicate in cells post transfection and could not generate the infectious particles for analyzing the early stages of viral replication [30]. Subsequently, DNA-launched replicons are transfected into the cells carrying the recombinant plasmid encoding the viral structural proteins, which express structural proteins and self-replicate viral subgenomes to generate single-round infectious particles (SRIP). Several flavivirus replicon-based SRIPs including JEV, dengue virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus have been generated, demonstrating the immunogenicity of virus-like particles [31,32,33,34,35,36].",

The replicon-based SRIPs containing the reporter genes of such fluorescent proteins could be more applicable as a rapid and real-time screening for the antiviral agents, as well as directly quantitate the antiviral activity under the condition without plaque-based assays. This study intends to establish a safe and reliable platform for screening antiviral agents and investigating antiviral mechanisms using JEV replicon-based SRIPs and flow cytometry (Figure 1). The reporter enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was fused with a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A peptide, and then cloned and in-frame fused with NS1~5 coding regions in pBR322 plasmid-based JEV-EGFP replicon (named as pBR322-JEVrep-EGFP). Subsequently, JEV-EGFP SRIPs were generated in the cells co-transfected with pBR322-JEVrep-EGFP and pFlag-CMV3-CprME. The infectivity of JEV-EGFP SRIPs was characterized by the replication of viral subgenomes and the expression of EGFP as well as viral proteins using real-time PCR and fluorescent microscopy. Finally, the antiviral screening platform was performed according to comparing the fluorescence intensity of EGFP in SRIP-infected cells with and without treatment by flow cytometry. Accuracy and reproducibility of the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of anti-JEV agent MJ-47 by JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry were further evaluated using plaque-reduction assay.",

In addition, fluorescent microscopy revealed the green fluorescence in the replicon-transfected cells, indicating the expression of replicon-driven EGFP. Immunofluorescent staining also demonstrated the synthesis of viral proteins like NS4B in transfected cells (Figure 4). Interestingly, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in replicon-transfected mock cells and replicon-transfected packaging cells, but not in mock cells and packaging cells (Figure 4). In addition, the CPE level was higher in replicon-transfected packaging cells than replicon-transfected mock cells, which was associated with a lower amount of E and NS4B in replicon-transfected packaging cells compared to replicon-transfected mock cells. JEV non-structural proteins like NS4B were more abundant than EGFP at late stage of JEV replicon replication in mock cells. The results showed that pBR322 plasmid-based JEV replicon enabled production of the self-replicated JEV RNA genomes and viral non-structural proteins in cells. ",

MJ-47 was a quinazolinone derivative with a low cytotoxicity (Figure 6A, Supplemental Figure S5). MJ-47 served as a significant inhibition on the JEV-induced cytopathic effect in TE671 cells, respectively (Figure 6B). MJ-47 had no effect on virucidal activity and virus attachment inhibition (Figure S6). Moreover, MJ-47 concentration-dependently reduced the expression of EGFP and viral proteins like NS3 in SRIP-infected mock cells. MJ-47 also suppressed the synthesis of positive-sense RNA subgenomes in SRIP-infected mock cells 36 h post treatment (Figure 6C,D), which demonstrated MJ-47 significantly decreasing the efficient self-replication of replicon-driven viral subgenomes. To examine the anti-JEV ability of MJ-47 using JEV-EGFP SRIPs, CprME-expressing packaging cells were subsequently infected with SRIPs at 10 TCID50 and simultaneously treated with and without MJ-47 (Figure 7). MJ-47 significantly inhibited SRIP-induced cytopathic effects and reduced the expression of green fluorescent protein in SRIP-infected packaging cells (Figure 7A). Green fluorescence in un-infected packaging cells and SRIP-infected packaging cells were analyzed using flow cytometry (Figure 7B,C). IC50 values of MJ-47 against JEV were 6.3 \u00b5M based on green fluorescence-positive cells and 16.3 \u00b5M according to the accumulated fluorescence intensity, respectively (Figure 7B,C). In comparison to JEV-EGFP SRIPs, wild type virions were used to examine the anti-JEV ability of MJ-47 in a conventional plaque assay, in which IC50 value of MJ-47 was 34.5 \u00b5M (Figure 7D). The results indicated that the antiviral assay with a combination of JEV-EGFP SRIPs and flow cytometry enabled measurement of the IC50 values of antiviral agents, and was more sensitive than the plaque reduction assay with JEV virions.",

Moreover, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase had a higher fidelity than RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Thus, this study constructed the CMV promoter-launched JEV replicon carrying a green fluorescence reporter (EGFP) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). However, the cloning process of JEV full-length infectious clones and replicons revealed that nonsense mutations (nt C741T and nt C831T) and the deletion with nt 574\u20131936 appeared in the one-third (nt 1\u20133600) of the JEV genome at 5\u2032-end (data not shown). Importantly, the nonsense mutations and deletion identified resulted in the production of truncated M protein and the loss of E protein in the cells. Our findings indicated that the prokaryotic promoter activity of the 5\u2032 one-third of JEV genome directed the synthesis of the structural proteins C, prM/M and E that might be toxic genes or proteins in bacteria. The toxic sequences, especially the region encoding the prM protein, correlated with the genetic instability of JEV infectious clones and replicons in E. coli. Our findings were similar to previous reports that several E. coli promoter sequences were identified within the 5\u2032 end of JEV genome, particularly nt 54\u2013120 [39,40]. Since a restriction enzyme ApaI site was located with JEV genome nt 114\u2013119, the nucleotides 1 to 119 of JEV genome encoding eight amino acids of the C protein were fused with the EGFP reporter gene in the CMV promoter-launched JEV replicon. In addition, the addition of restriction enzyme sequences NotI and ClaI before encoding partial C-terminal transmembrane (28 amino acids) of E protein allowed two unique restriction enzyme sites in the DNA-based JEV replicon that could be used as the expression vector in mammalian cells. Therefore, the CMV promoter-launched JEV-EGFP replicon did not contain the toxic sequence encoding the prM protein, allowing the stability of JEV cDNA clones in bacteria. In addition, recombinant plasmid with the nucleotide sequence 96\u20132477 of JEV genome encoding structural proteins C, prM/M and E was stable in bacteria due to lacking of the prokaryotic promoter at nt 54\u2013120. The pFlag-CMV-CprME exhibited the plasmid stability in E. coli.",

            "text": "The pBR322 plasmid, a low copy number plasmid, was chosen as the JEV replicon vector. The plasmid pBR322-based JEV-EGFP replicon was genetically stable in E. coli, exhibiting high nucleotide (99.62%) and amino acid (99.19%) identities (Tables S3 and S4). The pBR322-based replicon also had a higher yield in E.coli than cosmid vectors and bacterial artificial chromosomes [21], offering an effective and efficient approach for manipulating and cloning the viral genes. Among 23 non-silent mutations in the replicon compared to the original genome sequence of JEV T1P1 strain, eight mutated residues appeared within NS5 and three mutations occurred within NS3 (Table S4). These eight mutations in the replicon did not relate with active sites and conserved motifs of NS3 protease and helicase as well as NS5 methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase based on the structure and functionality analysis of flaviviral non-structural proteins [41,42]. In addition, the other 12 amino acid substitutions in the replicon sporadically existed within NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B did not match with the reported mutation sites that altered JEV replication [43,44]. The finding suggested that 23 mutations in the replicon might have no significant effect on virus replication. Functional characterization of JEV-EGFP replicon indicated a significant increase of green fluorescence intensity in replicon-transfected cells (Figure 4). Moreover, the percentage and yellow fluorescent intensity of NS4B-positive cells were is much higher than the percentage and green fluorescent intensity of EGFP-expressing cells post transfection with JEV-EGFP replicon. The results might be associated with the loss or quenching effect of EGFP fluorescence by the fixation process of stained cells with paraformaldehyde, ethanol or methanol [45]. Moreover, the synthesis of positive- and negative-sense RNA subgenomes as well as the expression of JEV proteins were detected in replicon-transfected cells (Figure 4 and Figure 5). JEV-EGFP replicon contained CMV immediate-early promoter at the 5\u2032-end, as well as HDVr and SV40 termination and polyadenylation sequences at the 3\u2032-end, which allowed the production of functional JEV subgenomes (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4). The pFlag-CMV-CprME was utilized to establish the packaging cell line that continuously expressed C, prM/M, and E proteins to allow the production of JEV SRIPs 36 h post a transient transfection with JEV-EGFP replicon (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Therefore, producing JEV SRIPs was an alternative approach to overcoming the obstacles in the genetic instability of JEV infectious clones using the full-length cDNA sequence. Although there is still a question about whether these mutations affect the genome replication efficiency, JEV-EGFP replicon and SRIP generated in this study could be used to screen antiviral agents. Then, the antiviral activity of identified agents might be further confirmed using wild type JEV virions.",

The fluorescent intensity and positivity in SRIP-infected cells were further quantitated using flow cytometry (Figure 5). The reasons for low EGFP-positive percentage and fluorescent intensity in un-treated SRIP-infected cells could be (1) a low infectious dose with 10 TCID50 SRIPs; (2) the loss of EGFP fluorescence with the fixation with ethanol, and (3) a highly stringent threshold for the positivity of green fluorescence in the infected cells. For increasing the EGFP-positive cells without treatment, the elevation of MOI was used in the assay and the fluorescent intensity in the infected cells were directly measured using a fluorescence microplate reader under the condition without the fixation agents. In the screening assay to identify antiviral agents, Figure 7C based on the total fluorescent intensity showed the near line with a negative slope in antiviral activity of MJ-47 against JEV, but not Figure 7B based on the green fluorescence positivity. Since plaque reduction assay was labor-intensive, time-consuming and safe keeping, the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP and flow cytometry might be easy, rapid, and safer approaches to determining the IC50 values of antiviral agents. Comparison of IC50 values of MJ-47 against JEV using plaque reduction and JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry indicated the IC50 value (6.28~16.05 \u00b5M) of MJ-47 by JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was lower than plaque reduction assay (34.5 \u00b5M) (Figure 7). The result demonstrated that the assay of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry was more sensitive than plaque reduction assay, showing the potential application in antiviral drug screening and neutralizing assays. In addition, the system of JEV-EGFP SRIP in packaging cells plus flow cytometry was easily observed using a fluorescent microscope and quantitated by flow cytometry, suggested as a better tool compared to the luciferase reporter system [38,40]. The approach for the design of JEV-EGFP SRIP plus flow cytometry might be applicable to other flaviviruses, such as dengue and Zika viruses. Moreover, the alternative approaches to quantitate replicon-driven reporter activity might be applicable for high-throughput screening antiviral agents, such as the combination of JEV-EGFP SRIP and fluorescence microplate reader.

Moreover, MJ-47 reduced the synthesis of viral genomes and the expression of viral proteins (Figure 6C,D), implying that MJ-47 significantly decreased the efficient self-replication of replicon-driven viral subgenomes. However, MJ-47 affected neither irreversible loss of JEV infectivity (virucidal activity), nor virus attachment to host cells (Supplemental Figure S6). Therefore, we suggested that anti-JEV mechanism(s) of MJ-47 could be related with the influence on late stages of JEV replication cycle, e.g., viral transcription and translation. Interestingly, several quinazolinone derivatives had identified their antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses, such varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza A virus, and hepatitis C virus [46,47,48]. A 2-pyridinyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone derivative potently inhibited the replication of influenza A virus in vitro via suppressing virus neuraminidase and cellular NF-\u03baB signal [47]. Quinazolinone-containing macrocycles were considered as next-generation HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors [48]. Therefore, MJ-47\u2019s antiviral ability might be further examined against other flaviviruses. ",
