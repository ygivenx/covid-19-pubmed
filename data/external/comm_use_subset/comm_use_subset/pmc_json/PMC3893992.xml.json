What is interesting about this 3-fold interaction is that the three of them incorporate disparate rationalities coming from different sociopolitical practices. While natural outbreaks are usually a public health issue, bioterrorist attacks are a civil defense and national security concern. The former is in deep relation with medicine and epidemiology, the latter with military forms of thought. This interaction is deeply related to United States (US) politics where, during the last quarter of the 20th century, diseases that were approached exclusively as medical issues became an issue for national security too (8). The third rationality mentioned is the one of laboratory accidents, mainly represented by accidental releases. This is regulated through biosafety rules, which are guided by the WHO, leaving the responsibility scattered among scientists, research institutions, and funding organizations. This third rationality interacts with the two previous ones by incorporating a controversial dilemma: life sciences research entails threat and progress in the same activity.",

This implicates that a given outbreak is understood under the light of military, health, and research rationalities at the same time (Figure 1).",

Threat and fear are instituted as the new normality (9) and biosecurity scenarios (10) are the only way to evaluate future events. This alert attitude needs to be maintained in order to be prepared to act in front of an emergency. A constant state of uncertainty brings in deep difficulties for governance processes. As future happenings are uncertain, effective policymaking becomes an extremely difficult task, if possible at all. In cases of sociotechnical controversy, the higher the stakes are, the less certainty is allowed (11).

In front of an unknown threat they adopt the perspective of what is called an \u201call hazards approach.\u201d Countries need to get themselves ready for any kind of possible threat. Calculations and probabilities seem to be left out here: a distant possibility, because of its potential effect, is taken as a very close one. In this context, the logics of biosecurity move from prevention to precaution and to preparedness (12). The first one, prevention, linked to veterinary practices, relies on data of prevalence and incidence: it is a rationality of cases and propagation zones and knowing the enemy means being able to fight it. Precaution, on the other hand, pays attention to the limitations of knowledge. In such a case, the possibility of a trustable prediction is put in doubt, opening space for public deliberation. Finally, preparedness blurs knowledge and focuses directly on the potential consequences of an event. It is not that the new rationality erases the previous one, but it limits its sphere of application. The lack of knowledge in preparedness is dealt through scenario development and simulation, where fiction and reality meet (13). As fiction easily tends to overcome reality, the influence of fiction-based risk assessment is much more profound than knowledge-based risk assessment. Hence, policies and funding seem to shift their interest more toward preparedness than toward prevention.",

These mutations made the virus able to be transmitted among ferrets, the most used animal model in human Influenza research. Concurrently, Yoshihiro Kawaoka, who runs two biolaboratories, one at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and another one at the University of Tokyo, carried out similar research with similar conclusions. Both researches were funded by the US government. Papers reporting on the results were sent to leading journals: Fouchier\u2019s to Science and Kawaoka\u2019s to Nature. But before publication, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB), the US institution competent in the matter, reviewed both papers to evaluate their implications related to dual-use research concerns. The papers were evaluated during October 2011 and a decision was made public in December: the papers would be published with redaction of the methodological design in order to avoid potential misuse of the mutant virus. Access to all the details of the research would be provided to certain authorized researchers. The publication was scheduled to take place during March 2012. As part of the controversy, a 60-day moratorium on HPAI H5N1 research was declared on January 2012, which finally lasted more than one year, until February 2013. The objective of such moratorium was \u201cto provide time to explain the public health benefits of this work, to describe the measures in place to minimize possible risks, and to enable organizations and governments around the world to review their policies\u201d (17). During that time, in February 2012, a new meeting between WHO and NSABB members took place. The result of such meeting was that both papers needed to be published fully. The arguments that led to this decision were the need to stimulate public health research and the difficulty on deciding who would and would not have access to the non-redacted material. A final meeting between the NSABB and the authors took place in March 2012 in order to revise the final drafts. At last, by June 22, 2012, both papers had been published (18,19).",

So, the first questions asked were related to how dangerous or beneficial the research actually was. On the one hand, the ability to make H5N1 transmissible in mammals could be used by bioterrorists and the fail of biosafety techniques could provoke an accidental release of the virus. On the other hand, knowing how the virus might develop can help to assess the threat posed by viruses sampled from wild or farm animals and human confirmed cases. Another source of problems that fed the controversy was the legal and political framework that surrounded it. US law did not allow redacting the research partly: it had to be published fully or classified. Also, politically, it raised problems at the international level. The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, run by the WHO, is a program that engages many countries and it is considered a basic tool for Influenza preparedness. Not sharing this information with the rest of the members of the PIP could be seen as problematic, motivating some countries to fall off the program (as Indonesia had done in front of another polemical situation regarding the fabrication of Influenza vaccines in 2006) (20).",

Being the samples already linked to the time and place of their collection, mutation in the laboratory implicates a new identity already: the virus result of biotechnological labor will differ from the original sample.

After such process, biotechnological labor is carried out. Both samples are submitted to modifications in order to potentiate their capability to be transmitted among mammals. In the case of Fouchier, by genetically modifying the virus using site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent serial passage in ferrets, the virus was able to be transmitted among ferrets. Furthermore, such material changes also affected the pathogenicity of the virus. Besides the ability of transmission, the fatality was drastically reduced and none of the recipient ferrets died after airborne infection with the mutant A/H5N1 viruses. In the case of Kawaoka, the team identified a reassortant H5 HA/H1N1 virus. This was a combination of H5N1 and an H1N1 sample from the 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak. Such reassortant was capable of droplet transmission in a ferret model. Kawaoka\u2019s virus replicated successfully among ferrets but was not highly pathogenic and did not cause mortality. The changes on their capacities are central to understand the controversy. The previous point of concern for biosecurity was the high pathogenicity of the A/H5N1 Influenza, and its ability to spread was the only thing keeping the virus out from becoming a pandemic (although it was considered a pandemic threat). Both mutated viruses incorporate the ability to be transmitted among humans (inferred through an animal model), but lose its high pathogenicity. At this point, the materiality and capacities of the virus have changed but its identity keeps being the same for a big part of the society, including politicians and regulators.",

The first interesting consequence of bio-objectification processes is the challenging of existing classifications and boundaries. Laboratory/nature becomes a relevant dichotomy for the configuration of the biological object. Through laboratory practices, nature is anticipated. The previously uncertain event of a natural mutation of a H5N1 Influenza virus is not only artificially predicted but also artificially enacted (the fictionalized prediction of a pandemic is, in a way, voluntarily pursued). Species boundaries are clearly another set of barriers that is challenged by the controversy. While the use of animal models, such as ferrets, is nothing new in biological research, the genetic engineering of the virus reminds us of the mobile barrier between epidemic, epizootic, and zoonotic diseases. A third category of challenged boundaries is the one of disciplines. As the controversy develops, the new virus enters, discursively, more and more disciplinary areas. The challenges for the researcher are beyond microbiology. They need to answer in front of the press, committees, boards, etc. The virus has entered the space of politics, law, international relationships, and security.",

While before it was classified as a natural threat, now it is classified as a human-made threat \u2013 therefore avoidable to some extent. Value creation is always in relation to the interactions of the virus with other social actors. In the proper hands, the virus will acquire the proper value \u2013 ie, a positive value. Researchers will use it for public health benefit. In the wrong hands, it will acquire negative value as terrorists could use it for nefarious purposes. But it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty of such changes. The abilities to carry out genetic engineering are not so easy to learn and, on the other hand, laboratory accidents are not only dependent on the good will of researchers. So, whether the engineered virus will become a great opportunity to tackle the pandemic influenza threat or a great threat for the entire humanity remains unknown.

            "text": "Thinking of biological controversies in terms of bio-objectification allows us to reflect on materiality and meaning as processes that, far from being stable, are constantly on-the-making. The eventual and transitory stability of biological entities is always linked to broader social processes that escape scientific practice. The attention paid by the bio-objects framework to political and, more precisely, regulatory practices, is crucial to understand the stabilization of bio-objects submitted to processes of biotechnologization and their identification processes. Furthermore, the bio-objects framework seems to be useful in order to analyze the most molecular dimensions of biosecurity, having its starting point in the technical labor carried out in microbiology laboratories. This way, it helps connecting the practical dimensions attached to the practice of microbiology to the political dimensions attached to policymaking in biosecurity.",
