The envelope hemagglutinin glycoprotein on MeV interacts with cellular receptors, which determines the virus\u2019 pathogenesis. The virus initiates infection in the respiratory tract by infecting resident immune cells expressing the receptor signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)/CD150 [2,3]. Next, MeV is transferred to local lymph nodes and spreads systemically to other organs and tissues by cell fusion, forming syncytia, known as Warthin-Finkeldey cells.

The fact that wild-type genotypes show a distinct signature of antigenic determinants in comparison to genotype A prompted us to review the long-held hypothesis of antigenic drift in viral persistence. Because the MeV envelope hemagglutinin protein (MeV-H) is the major target of virus-neutralizing antibodies that arise during infection by MeV and because it is subject to increased immunologic pressure [13\u201317], we generated viruses that contained the MeV-H genes found in 3 SSPE autopsy cases. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that antigenic drift is involved in the pathogenesis of SSPE by analyzing antigenic alterations in MeV-H found in decedents with SSPE in relation to major circulating MeV genotypes.",

Of the potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) of MeV-H, N200 is known to be glycosylated [20,21]. In addition, an F180S point mutation in this MeV-H SMa84 creates a PNGS at N178 (178NQF\u2192NQS), although its potential usage was not predicted by the NetNGlyc 1.0 server [22]. Thus, we investigated the glycosylation status of MeV-H SMa84 by peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment, which releases asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. In the presence of PNGase F, all MeV-H forms were completely deglycosylated and showed an identical migration pattern, with the exception of MeV-H SMa79 that migrated at a slightly lower molecular weight (Fig 1A). When the proteins were left untreated, the electrophoretic mobility of the MeV-H SMa79 and SMa84 was decreased in relation to that of MeV-H A and SMa94. These results indicate that an N-glycan moiety is absent in the MeV-H of genotype C1 (SMa84), whereas the precise biochemical aberration causing a lower molecular weight for SMa79 is currently unknown.",

We also included the L181F mutation, which is present in SMa84, because the N-glycosylation efficiency is dependent on the surrounding sequence [23]. Previously, Santiba\u00f1ez and coworkers [24] confirmed the glycosylation of a PNGS 416DLS>NLS in genotype D7. We therefore introduced a D416N mutation as a positive control for our experimental setup. Total and surface expression levels were decreased for the N200D mutant but were comparable in the other mutants (Fig 1B and 1D). Curiously, a distinct double band in the MeV-H D416N was observed after PNGase F treatment (apparent molecular masses of 59.3 and 61.3 kDa) (Fig 1B). This higher-molecular-weight band most likely corresponds to a partially deglycosylated form. As expected, the relative mobility of the D416N mutant was decreased compared with the unmodified/unmutated MeV-H, but it was increased for the N200D mutant (Fig 1B). No differences in electrophoretic mobility were observed for the F180S/L181P mutant. Overall, these results confirm that an N-glycan moiety is absent in the MeV-H of genotype C1. Interestingly, the gel shift was greater in the MeV-H D416N mutant than in genotype C1 (SMa84) (mean [SD]: 3.65[0.21] kDa vs 1.60 [0.14] kDa), despite both types being distinguishable from the standard MeV-H genotype A by 1 glycan moiety (Fig 1).",

The IgG1-Fc region fused to the receptors was used for purification via protein G, which facilitated detection of the protein bound to the plastic-coated MeV-H.

A FLAG-tag epitope in the C-terminal domain was also attached to control the amount of protein used for coating.

According to the nectin-4 binding curve shape, a low-binding-affinity group comprising genotypes F (SMa94) and B3.1 was identified. However, the other MeV-H from genotype F, SMa79, showed only residual binding to nectin-4.

We also used recombinant Moraten viruses encoding the genotype-specific MeV-H genes we have previously described [15]. The comparative fusion activity is shown in Fig 4A, in which we measured the area of the syncytia observed 48 hours after infection of Vero/hSLAM. The virally expressed MeV-H forms showed significantly different syncytium-inducing capacity. Specifically, MeV encoding genotype H1-specific MeV-H showed superior syncytium-inducing capacity in relation to clade A (P < .005), genotype D4.1 (P < .05), and genotype F (SSPE case SMa94; P < .05).

A comparable decrease in MeV-F expression was also detected for this virus, which argues against significant differences in expression across recombinant viruses.

Individual neutralization curves for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with recombinant MeV containing MeV-H genes of genotype A (Moraten vaccine strain), H1 (wild-type), C1 (SSPE case SMa84), and F (SSPE cases SMa79 and SMa94) are shown in the S1 Fig. mAbs targeting antigenic sites Ia (I-29 and BH141), and III (cl55, BH067, and BH026) neutralized all recombinant MeVs tested; neutralization potency was greatest at site III, followed by site Ib/NE (BH047, BH059, and BH129) and site Ia. All antigenic sites had characteristic dose-response curve slopes, except for mAb cl55 with genotype H1, in which residual resistance was observed. Neutralization heterogeneity was shown for genotype H1 when mAbs specific to the noose antigenic site were used. Whereas mAb BH101 neutralized genotype H1, mAbs BH216, 8905, and I-44 did not. None of these antibodies showed neutralization activity against the genotype C1 (SSPE SMa84) MeV, which demonstrates a complete absence of this antigenic site.

Interestingly, the F (SMa79) virus possesses an E492G mutation and shows increased neutralization sensitivity to mAb BH097. To confirm that a Gly492 is responsible for this phenotype, we introduced the E492G mutation into the vaccine genotype A MeV-H gene and assessed its neutralization sensitivity. Whereas no differences in neutralization sensitivity were observed with the nearby-located antigenic site IIb-targeting antibody BH125, enhanced neutralization activity was observed with BH097 (Fig 5D). This result broadens our previous finding in which some genotypes might show enhanced sensitivity to neutralization by antigenic site IIa-targeting mAbs via point mutations at amino acid 492. Recombinant viruses with the N416-sugar shield (D416N\u2192NLS), but not those unshielded (N416Q), escaped neutralization only by BH125 (Fig 5D and 5E). Overall, a correlation between the disease time course for SSPE (Table 1) and antigenic mutability cannot be drawn from these neutralization assay results.",

The mAbs previously used were derived from mice; thus, we used polyclonal anti-MeV-H mouse sera induced by vaccination with an adenovirus encoding the genotype A Edmonston strain of MeV-H. To directly measure the contribution of the antibody repertoires to virus neutralization, we used heat-inactivated mouse serum (56\u00b0C for 30 min) to assess the neutralization activity against recombinant MeVs. The results showed that no recombinant MeV escaped a polyclonal anti-MeV-H response (Fig 7). However, the neutralization curves for the SSPE forms were shifted nonsignificantly to the right in relation to A viruses (ie, decreased neutralization potency). Since H1 virus was superior in escaping multiple mAbs, the number of epitopes lacking in MeV-H does not preclude immune evasion. However, a particular pattern of sensitivity to mAb neutralization might affect the overall neutralization by polyclonal antibodies.",

Our work provides direct and concrete evidence that the MeV-H found in the brain of decedents with SSPE behaves similarly to other wild-type MeV-H forms. Antigenic change, then, does not occur over the disease course and is not a risk factor for SSPE. The conclusions are based on the following experimental evidence. First, we demonstrated that the MeV-H obtained by direct sequencing of brain autopsy material is functional despite extensive amino acid substitutions and produces cell-to-cell fusion in a receptor-binding fashion. Next, we showed that SSPE MeV-Hs efficiently interact with known wild-type MeV receptors, SLAM and nectin-4, but not with the CD46 receptor used by the live attenuated measles vaccine. Finally, we built and rescued recombinant MeVs in which the gene for MeV-H was substituted for that from SSPE cases and found that their neutralization sensitivity was similar to that of viruses coding for MeV-H from major circulating MeV genotypes. Collectively, this experimental evidence strongly supports the overall concept that the antigenic differences found in SSPE viruses are of similar magnitude to those of currently circulating MeV genotypes.",

These reports invariably were published many years before the identification of antigenic differences among circulating MeV genotypes [15,24,29,34\u201337] and were unable to address specific differences in antigenicity. At the time, SLAM/CD150 was not yet identified as the relevant MeV receptor [38] (ie, 7 years after the initial discovery of the membrane cofactor protein/CD46 as a receptor). Consequently, cells expressing CD46 were broadly used for virus isolation before it was proved to induce attenuation [39\u201341]. Similarly, testing whether SSPE strains develop from classical MeV strains under immune selective pressure was complicated by difficulty isolating the virus from the central nervous system [12,30]. Indeed, some SSPE viruses have been shown to be laboratory contaminants [12,42,43].",

Our results in tissue culture revealed nectin-4\u2013mediated fusion of SSPE MeV-Hs, despite its weak binding with nectin-4. Another MeV-H (genotype B3.1) was also shown to weakly interact with nectin-4. We did not study the cell-to-cell fusion capacity of MeV-H genotype B3.1 in nectin-4\u2013expressing cells, but a positive correlation between syncytium formation and attenuation was observed previously [52]. In turn, syncytia formation positively correlates with receptor binding affinity [53,54]. Of interest, MeV genotype B3.1 has been reported to be more pathogenic than genotype C2 [55]. Unfortunately, MeV-H genotype C2 was not included in our study. The results of our MeV-H-receptor binding studies should be interpreted with caution because previous studies gave discordant results [25]. Similar discrepancies have also been observed between plasmid-mediated fusion and that of recombinant viruses encoding the corresponding genes [52,56], although in these cases, interaction of the MeV matrix protein with the MeV glycoproteins seems a reasonable explanation [27].",

Because the oligomeric state in the soluble form of MeV-H remains the same as in the membrane-anchored form [57], it is tempting to speculate that the lack of higher oligomeric species for MeV-H genotype C1 could have failed to compensate for low-affinity binding to the tag we used through avidity. The lack of a clear relationship between oligomeric status, surface expression, and syncytium-inducing capacity for MeV-H discouraged us from further characterization of this point [58].",

After an extensive search of the literature, we could find only genotypes C1, F, and E to be associated with SSPE cases. As shown here, wild-type MeV genotypes may be even more resistant to neutralization by mAbs than SSPE viruses.

Ndifon et al [63] observed in influenza viruses that specific amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin protein increased neutralization sensitivity of the escape variant by previously generated mAbs; similar phenomena have been reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus [64\u201367]. Specifically, if there is steric competition for antigen binding between antibodies with different neutralization potency, a mutation that increases binding of antibodies with low neutralizing potency would decrease the overall viral neutralization. Indeed, the MeV-H antigenic site IIa (low neutralization efficiency) is located adjacent to the noose antigenic site (high neutralization efficiency), thereby potentially leading to a decrease in viral neutralization by polyclonal mouse antibodies. This would explain the slight decrease in sensitivity of SMa79 despite being neutralized by all mAbs tested. The disruption in the structure of the noose antigenic site in SMa84 apparently had the same effect in polyclonal-mediated neutralization. The immunodominance of the noose antigenic site would then offer a plausible explanation to the shift observed in the neutralization curve with polyclonal sera.",

The protein-specific leader sequence was substituted for the murine Ig \u03ba-chain leader sequence, and the whole ectodomains were subcloned upstream from a cassette coding for the human engineered IgG1 Fc region, which is part of the expression vector pFUSE (pfc1-hg1e3; Invivogen). A 3C protease cleavage sequence was introduced at the 5\u2032-end of the Fc region. MeV receptor-Fc fusion proteins were prepared from transient transfection with the Expi293 expression system (Gibco). Proteins secreted to culture supernatants were purified by affinity chromatography with a HiTrap protein G column (GE Healthcare). Stepwise elution was performed with 100 mM glycine, pH 2.7, and immediately neutralized with 1M Na2PO4, pH 9.0 (1:10). The protein size and purity was evaluated by reducing SDS-PAGE analysis and SimplyBlue SafeStain. Protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein assay (ThermoFisher).",

Cytoplasmic extract of Vero cells transfected with plasmid DNA encoding MeV-F protein from genotype A and different MeV-H forms (genotype A; genotype F, patients SMa79 and SMa94; and genotype C1, patient SMa84) were treated with or without PNGase F before they were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. MeV-F served as a double control for transfection and gel electrophoresis. In the presence of PNGase F, the electrophoretic migration pattern is not affected by glycosylation status. The apparent molecular mass is indicated above the corresponding band for the untreated MeV-H. MeV-H genotype C1 lacks a potential N-linked glycosylation site (PNGS) at N200 and shows a downward band shift compared with MeV-H genotype A and F (SMa94) proteins. MeV-H F (SMa79) cannot be detected by anti-MeV-H cytoplasmic tail antibodies, but the anti-MeV-H globular head BH195 antibody revealed a similar downward band shift regardless of the presence of N-linked glycans. B, Glycosylation of MeV-H mutants. MeV-H encodes 5 PNGS at N168, N187, N200, N215, and N238, but only the first 4 have been shown to be glycosylated (theoretical vs experimental glycosylation). An N200D mutation would destroy an active PNGS, whereas F180S/L181P and D416N would create additional PNGSs. A downward shift is observed for N200D, whereas an upward shift is seen for the D416N mutant. No changes in electrophoretic mobility were observed for the F180S/L181P mutant. After removal of N-linked glycans, all proteins migrate equally. D416N shows an additional band likely corresponding to a +1 PNGS. C, Oligomerization state of SSPE MeV-H proteins. Cytoplasmic extracts were resolved under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted with anti-MeV-Hcyt. The different oligomeric states are indicated.
