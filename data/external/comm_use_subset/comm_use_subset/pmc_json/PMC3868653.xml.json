The risks of TB transmission in an area are influenced by the epidemics of TB in neighboring areas, as shown by high-risk transmission areas cluster in some regions. Geographically, the burden of TB is highest in Asia and Africa globally. About 60% of reported TB cases occur in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions, and 24% in the African Region[1]. In China, the epidemic of TB is unevenly distributed within the country with higher prevalence in rural, especially in the relatively poor north and west areas. According to the 5th national TB survey in 2010, the highest prevalences of active TB and sputum smear-positive (SS+) TB were observed in the west region, whereas the east region had the lowest prevalences[5]. The uneven distribution of the TB in the country highlights the importance of geographically tailed, pro-poor strategies in TB prevention and control in resources scarcity regions of China. ",

Spatial clustering analysis can detect spatial autocorrelation when the values of variables at nearby locations are not independent from each other[6]. The basic assumption of spatial autocorrelation is that biological processes such as speciation, extinction, dispersal or species interactions are distance-related[7]. Spatial autocorrelation may be seen as an opportunity for further analysis, as it provides information for inference of process from pattern such as geographic dispersal of TB[8,9]. A study conducted by Roza DL had used spatial analysis to identify the areas with elevated risk of TB and evaluate the influences of social vulnerability[10]. Factors affecting the distribution and pattern of TB, including TB notification rate and TB incidence rate etc., usually show spatial autocorrelation and obvious spatial heterogeneity[11], which is difficult for the traditional model to deal with[12]. The TB epidemic environments which have limited resources and tools to assist decision support need to take account of these limitations. However, spatial antocorrelation is one way to expore the relationship of factor among the neighboring areas. Additionally, there are few surveys developed for describing TB spatial distribution based on county-level nationally in China. ",

Currently this daily web based surveillance system covers 37 notifiable infectious diseases including TB and web-based reporting has been achieved in almost all the counties in China[15,16]. Every case of TB diagnosed is reported by county center for disease prevention and control (CDC) with information on age, sex, address, results of smear microscopy, diagnosis and other clinical information through the web based surveillance system from which notification data is generated. In China, county CDC takes the responsibility of case management and report within the county, and the case detection rate of TB in China has reached 89% according to the WHO[1].",

The value of Global Moran\u2019s I varies between -1 and 1. A higher positive Moran\u2019s I indicates that values in neighboring positions tend to cluster, while a lower negative Moran\u2019s I implies that higher and lower values are interspersed. When Moran\u2019s I is near 0, there is no spatial clustering, meaning that the data are randomly distributed[21]. The data of this study were stored by ArcGIS 10 software to create a spatial database and the global spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted using the package of Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran\u2019s I) in ArcGIS 10. Furthermore, the reverse distance between two areas was considered as the conceptualization of spatial relationship, implying that nearby neighboring features had a larger influence on the computation for a target feature than that features far away[22]. Both Z-score and p-value were calculated to evaluate the significance of Global Moran\u2019s I.

SaTScan is a open source cluster software program developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and other institutions. And the space-time scan statistics can be used for time-periodic surveillance, where the analysis is repeated every year[23]. Not only the geographical information, but also the time-periodic variable can be utilized by the space-time scan statistics to explore the possible spatial concentration and temporal persistence. In this study, the surveillance database for 7 years was collected from 2005 to 2011. TB cases notified in each county were used and recorded against the population in the same county which was assumed as the population in the Possion probability model. The space-time scan statistic creates an infinite number of discrete, cylindrical windows with a circular geographic base and with height corresponding to time. The base is defined exactly as for the purely spatial scan statistic, while the height reflects the time period of potential clusters. Each cylindrical window was evaluated as a possible TB space-time cluster[23]. Therefore, the space-time scan statistic that can use both the geographical information and the time-periodic variable simultaneously is more suitable for the database. The distribution and statistical significance of the space-time clusters was analyzed by means of Monte Carlo replication under the null hypothesis with the default 999 replications to ensure adequate power for defining clustering. Most likely clusters and secondary clusters were reported by SaTScan. The likelihood function is maximized over all window locations and sizes, and the one with the maximum likelihood constitutes the most likely cluster, which is least likely to have occurred by chance. Secondary clusters were detected in the same way as for the most likely cluster, by comparing the log likelihood ratio of secondary clusters in the real data set with the log likelihood ratios of the most likely cluster in the simulated data sets[23]. TB Clusters including most likely cluster and secondary clusters, were presented in this study.",

Thus new SS+ notification rate is one indicator of TB transmission risk and Total TB notification rate is one indicator of TB burden. Because Type A region in Figure 2 was under the coverage of clusters for new SS+ notification rate but not under the coverage of clusters for total TB notification rate, Type A region had less TB burden than the neighboring areas on SS- cases, sputum smear not done, tuberculous pleurisy cases and extrapulmonary TB, but more risks of TB transmission. This may be explained by (1) Type A region is mountainousand has facilities with lesser techniques of TB diagnosis. Many TB patients with atypical symptoms of TB in Type A region had to go to the big hospitals with high techniques for further diagnosis which are located in other big cities. As such TB patients then were reported by those big hospitals (2). this area is characterized by low temperatures and hence the people live in the very close proximity which increases the risk of TB transmission among the inhabitants.",

Hohhot and Taiyuan cities as the provincial capitals of Inner Mongolia and Shanxi provinces respectively have designed TB facilities with higher techniques for TB diagnosis and treatment, clustered more cases which can not be diagnosed in local hospitals with lesser techniques in other prefecture cities or counties. As an indicator of TB burden, total TB notification rate lumps together SS- cases, sputum smear not done, tuberculous pleurisy cases and extrapulmonary TB besides SS+, this was associated with more clustering as shown in Figure 2-B. This patient flow from prefecture city or county to provincial capital could result in the difference of clusters between Figure 2-B and A. Furthermore, the clustering of global spatial autocorrelation showed positive trend with the time globally (t=6.87, p<0.01). It meant that the spatial distribution of total TB notification rate became more and more clustered as time went by.

Therefore, Spatial-temporal clustering analysis by SaTScan was utilized. SaTScan would still be concentrated in the geographical clustering areas. Simultaneously, it would be extended in a third dimension reflecting the population size as it changes over time. Although the results of global spatial autocorrelation on new SS+ notification rate didn\u2019t indicate significant temporal trend, the statistical analysis of Global Moran\u2019s I every year was significant and the clusters were detected by SaTScan in the south-central, northeast and west regions of China. As patients with sputum smear\u2013negative TB are less infectious than patients with sputum smear\u2013positive TB[24], this may suggest that close contacts of patients with positive smear were more likely to develop TB disease[25]. Thus, areas of clusters for new SS+ notification rate had more risks of TB transmission than the other areas. But these clusters didn\u2019t have the trend to aggregate year by year due to insignificant statistics of the trend test for Moran\u2019s I.
