Moreover, little information is current available for functional genes in I. tinctoria and I. indigotica. The genetic transformation efficiency of I. indigotica has been significantly improved recently, which is expected to promote the breeding process of I. indigotica using a genetically modified approach. However, lack of genomic sequences, particularly sequences of functional genes, makes it now impossible to improve the performance of I. indigotica by gene transformation. It is thus necessary to discover and characterize transcriptome of I. indigotica.",

To this end, messenger RNAs (mRNA) isolated from leaves and roots of the vigorously vegetative growth stages were used in creation of RNA-seq library. Unigenes were de novo assembled from the sequenced short reads. The unigenes were then annotated by BLASTX search, Gene Ontology (GO) classification and pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

From these contigs, 73,655 transcripts with a median size (N50) of 1,818 bp and 33,238 unigenes with an N50 of 1,628 bp were assembled (Table 1, Dataset S1).

These results suggest that the assembly is in high quality. At the same time, each primer set was used to amplify the corresponding genomic DNA (gDNA) of the seven unigenes (Dataset S2). For each unigene, the cDNA sequence matched well with its corresponding gDNA except some mismatches at one or both ends, which was most likely caused by not perfect reading at the beginning of the sequences during direct sequencing using one of the PCR primers (Figure S2). The gDNA sizes of two unigenes (Isatis indigotica 1223 and Isatis indigotica 5014) were the same as their corresponding cDNAs (Figure S1), suggesting that Isatis indigotica 1223 and Isatis indigotica 5014 contains no intron whereas the other five unigenes contain intron(s) in the amplified fragments (Figure S2).",

The category with the largest number of unigenes was metabolism, which includes amino acid metabolism (122), biosynthesis of metabolites (837), degradation of metabolites (434), nucleotide metabolism (179), lipid metabolism (220), nitrogen metabolism (45) and biosynthesis of indole alkaloids (8). The unigenes with a potential role in metabolism of indole and its derivatives were listed in Table S3. The second largest category was genetic information processing, which contained 857 unigenes. High yield and content of the effective medicinal components, such as indole alkaloid and its derivatives, are the two major targets of I. Indigotica production. To achieve these goals, previous studies in I. indigotica have been focused on metabolism of nitrogen and secondary substances, such as indole alkaloids. Identification of 45 unigenes involved in nitrogen metabolism and 8 unigenes related to biosynthesis of indole alkaloids in this study provide foundation for molecular characterization of their roles in biosynthesis of indole alkaloids in I.

Of the 11,373 unigenes that are longer than 1 kb, 4,509 unigenes were found to contain 6,400 SSR markers (Table S4). Among these 4,509 unigenes, 1,378 contained two or more SSRs.

Insights on the functions of the I. indigotica unigenes were achieved by blast search against various databases. Among these databases, GO and COG are the most commonly used for functional classification of unigenes. COG is a database in which orthologous genes are classified and clustered. Every protein in COG is assumed to be evolved from an ancestor protein, and the whole database is built based on proteins of completely annotated genomes as well as their systematic evolutionary relationships with the orthologous proteins in bacteria and algae. GO is an international standardized gene functional classification system which offers a controlled vocabulary and strictly defined concept to comprehensively describe properties of genes and their products in any organism. With the help of GO functional classification, we could understand the distribution of gene function at the macro level and predict the potential physiological and molecular role of each unigene. COG and GO classifications revealed that the assembled I. indigotica unigenes have diverse molecular functions and are involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways (Figures 1, 2). In addition, by search against the KEGG database, we were able to assign a large number of unigenes into different metabolism pathways, including carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, glucose metabolism and indole alkaloid metabolism (Figure 3). These results will facilitate molecular characterization of the genes involved in the pathways of interest.",

The primers used were listed in Table S1. The PCR reaction (20 \u00b5L) consists of: 2 \u00b5L of cDNA, 2 \u00b5L of 10\u00d7Buffer, 2 \u00b5L of forward and reverse primers (2 \u00b5M), 2 \u00b5L of MgCl2 (2.5 mM), 0.2 \u00b5L of Taq DNA Polymerase (5000 U/mL), 2 \u00b5L of dNTPs (2 mM) and 9.8 \u00b5L of ddH2O.

The PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, excised and gel purified and then sequenced directly at Invitrogen (Shanghai, China). The corresponding genomic DNA fragments of the cDNAs were amplified using DNA extracted with the CTAB method and purified and sequenced as aforementioned. cDNAs and their corresponding genomic DNAs were aligned to find intron(s) in the unigenes.",
