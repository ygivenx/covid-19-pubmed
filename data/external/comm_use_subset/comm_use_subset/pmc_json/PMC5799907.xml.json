Nevertheless, parvoviruses can be detected in faeces forup to 6 weeks after recovery, depending on the sensitivity of the diagnostic method used [10]. Cats experimentally infected with FPV shed the virus in both urine and faeces up to day 41\u201342 post-infection with parvovirus persisting in the lungs and kidneys for more than 50 weeks in cats which have recovered [11]. The detection of FPV and CPV variants in apparently healthy cats suggests that parvovirus infection may be common in some populations of clinically normal cats, and that asymptomatic cats may be able to shed parvovirus for prolonged periods of time [12\u201314]. Furthermore, the ability of FPV and CPV to persist in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of cats irrespective of the presence of neutralising antibodies [13\u201317] and the presence of parvoviral DNA in the bone marrow of healthy cats [18], suggests that parvovirus may persist long term in the tissues of cats post-infection without causing clinical signs.",

Buffy coats from cats sampled between October 2011 and March 2012 were tested for the presence of feline and canine parvovirus DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The partial VP2 gene of the viruses identified was sequenced and used for statistical analyses and phylogenetic comparisons. In addition, the sera of the cats which were positive to DNA parvoviruses were tested for the parvovirus antibody using the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Samples of owned or stray cats with different life-style conditions (indoor or outdoor, living alone or in community) were tested to evaluate different exposure to parvoviruses. Date of sampling, gender, age, breed, habitat and the clinical symptoms of the 54 cats sampled are reported in Table 1. According to these data, the animals were divided into two groups called A and B. The cats included in Groups A were predominantly healthy cats from four multi-cat households. The cats in Group B were sampled in the Emergency Room of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine (UNISS) and were predominantly stray cats showing different clinical signs (sick cats). Twenty-two of the 54 (40.7%) cats were clinically normal; 26/54 (48.1%) showed clinical signs attributable to various diseases; 3/54 (5.6%) showed gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting and diarrhoea compatible with parvovirus infection; clinical status was unavailable for 3/54 (5.6%) cats. The vaccination status of the cats included in the study was unknown, although it was hypothesised that the stray cats were unvaccinated.",

The fluorescence signal was acquired on the FAM channel (multi-channel machine, source, 470 nm; detector, 510 nm; gain set to 5) with a fluorescence reading taken at the end of each elongation step. Each run consisted of an initial incubation in order to activate the hot-start DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 20 s and polymerisation at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. During the melt cycle, the temperature was increased by increments of 1 \u00b0C from 65 \u00b0C to 95 \u00b0C. A pCR 4 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) containing one copy of the VP2 target sequence was produced as the external standard for the construction of the assay standard curve for quantitative analysis. Duplicates of six 10-fold dilutions of the standard plasmid, duplicates of the buffy coat DNA extracts of the cats sampled and a no template control were simultaneously analysed. Specimens were considered positive if the fluorescence curve in the amplification plot showed an exponential increase, and if a specific melting peak was observed. Copies of viral DNA were expressed per microlitre of DNA extract.",

This strain was used in HI experiments because there are no significant differences in serum titres inhibiting the haemagglutination reaction when cats are infected by FPV or CPV, if CPV is used as an antigen [22]. To calculate 8 haemagglutinating units (HAU) of the viral antigen, a haemagglutination (HA) assay was carried out on the CPV-2b isolate following procedures described previously by Carmichael et al. [22]. Porcine erythrocytes were washed three times in Bis-Tris Buffered Saline (BTBS, pH 6.2 at 4 \u00b0C) and suspended into 0.5% (v/v) BTBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. To reveal the haemagglutination of both viruses, the test was conducted at a pH of 6\u20136.8 and was incubated at 4 \u00b0C [23, 24].",

Furthermore, since parvovirus can frequently be isolated in infected cats, even in the presence of high virus-neutralising antibodies [15, 17], antibody titres against parvovirus were established in the sera of positive cats using an HI assay.",

In our study, the absence of clinical signs consistent with parvovirosis in the cats which tested positive, together with the low amount of viral DNA detected, suggested that the infection was asymptomatic or that residual viral DNA remains in the organism after recovery from acute infection. Furthermore, the detection of parvoviral DNA in WBC reveals the presence of the virus in the bone marrow or in other lymphoid tissues which might reflect chronic or latent infection. The detection of CPV DNA in apparently healthy domestic cats confirmed a previous survey in which a high prevalence (37%) of CPV in apparently healthy domestic cats living in rescue shelters was identified [14]. Canine parvovirus-like DNA was also detected in the tissues of wildlife carnivores which had no clinical signs of active infection and, therefore, it was likely that this virus caused latent or persistent infection not only in domestic cats [26]. Animal parvoviruses, such as Rodent protoparvovirus and Aleutian mink disease parvovirus, have been shown to persist in their host [27, 28]. Persistence is a common feature also for human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection [29]: B19V parvoviral DNA has been documented in a wide range of tissues and the bone marrow of asymptomatic adults, although the majority of people harbour parvoviral DNA in a form which does not actively replicate [30, 31].",

Some studies have suggested that CPV had the same pathogenic potential as FPV in cats [3, 32\u201335]; in other studies, clinical signs were not observed in infected animals, with the exception of transient leukopenia [36, 37]. These results led to the speculation that CPV, compared to FPV, can most frequently cause asymptomatic and persistent infection in cats, even if additional studies are clearly needed to fully understand the potential of cats as CPV carriers. In our study, an equivalent prevalence of FPV and CPV was found in the samples examined; this result might be related to the type of cat population sampled, which consisted mainly of healthy cats and cats showing clinical signs not related to parvovirosis. Alternatively, it could be due to the biological matrix analysed since parvoviruses have commonly been investigated in the faeces of infected animals; instead, in our survey the WBC were analysed.",

This result was congruent with the evolutive behaviour of FPV which, since its emergence in 1920, has not undergone significant changes in antigenic and biological properties. Feline panleukopenia virus varied at a slow rate by random genetic drift and it maintained host-specificity [38]. Instead, in the CPV sequence data set, non-synonymous mutations were predominant. This finding is compatible with the pattern of evolution observed for CPV. Since its emergence in the late 1970s, CPV evolution has been driven by strong positive selection, giving rise to new antigenic variants which have replaced the original type [38].",

Carnivore parvoviruses are very prone to genetic evolution, showing substitution rates similar to those of RNA viruses, with values of approximately 10\u2212 4 substitutions per site per year. This result, together with the detection of CPV-2c, which has already been reported in multiple infections of high genetic complexity [3, 5, 39], confirmed that co-infection with different species of parvovirus in feline hosts led to a high genetic variability and to the potential emergence of new viruses [3].",
