Numerous mechanisms play an apparent role in the spread of viruses between farms, including the movement of infectious animals, airborne spread of aerosols, wildlife, and contaminated fomites (i.e., trucks, equipment, boots), feed and personnel2\u20135. However, the relative importance of those drivers for between-farm transmission remains poorly understood. Movement of animals into a farm, for example, clearly increases the probability of disease introduction6, and understanding the network of livestock movements and analyzing the routes, volumes, frequency, and risks associated with animal movement is a prerequisite effective preventive, control, and disease surveillance measures in livestock6\u20138. At the same time, local spread of viruses between neighboring farms in close spatial proximity has been repeatedly demonstrated, perhaps mediated by windborne or fomite-related mechanisms9,10. A farm\u2019s risk of infection may thus be impacted not just by its own animal movements, but also by movements made by neighbors. These local spatial dynamics are rarely accounted for in network-based assessments of risks associated with livestock movement, although such dynamics are an emergent property of epidemiological models simulating disease spread in spatial networks11,12.",

Large-scale datasets in which to investigate the interacting roles of animal movements versus local transmission in between-farm spread are largely lacking. This is especially true for endemic diseases, where farm-level occurrences are often not tracked, and for countries in which no regional or national-level databases are available for livestock premise locations and animal movements. In the United States, limited data exists on the structure and connectivity of livestock movement networks because reporting the movement of animals between farms is not required as long as movements do not cross state boundaries. Swine production companies, or \u201csystems,\u201d are vertically integrated, with pigs generally moving from sow farms to nurseries to finishing farms. However, movements are not tracked by governmental agencies responsible for animal health. In contrast to many other developed and middle-income countries, the structure and connectivity of the swine industry has only been described to a limited extent16,17.",

            "text": "In this study, we explored how the occurrences of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in sow farms is influenced by the potential interacting effects of animal movement (movements into neighboring farms), local spatial spread, and environmental conditions. Briefly, PEDV is a RNA coronavirus in the family Alphacoronaviridae that causes high pre-weaning mortality in piglets18. The virus emerged in the United States in 2013 and rapidly spread to 30 states infecting approximately 50% of breeding herds by the middle of 201419. PEDV transmission among individual pigs occurs primarily by direct and indirect contact via the fecal-oral route19,20. Recent research has examined the role of animal transport in the spread of PEDV21\u201323. An analysis of the animal movement network for one swine system showed the frequency of movements declined during the initial emergence of PEDV24. Indirect transmission between farms may also be possible via airborne mechanisms25,26. Potential environmental conditions that may facilitate virus survivability in the environment include temperature27 and relative humidity28, but these environmental factors have not been integrated into broader analyses of risk factors for transmission. More generally, there is a lack of quantitative knowledge about the impact of meteorological, environmental, and topographic features (i.e. land cover, slope) on PEDV spread, though recent work on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) suggests that there are potential relationships between environmental and topographic variables and between-farm virus transmission29.",

For this study, we define a neighborhood as a 10 km radius around each sow farm. First, we describe flows of pig movements into and between neighborhoods. Our second and main objective was to quantify the weekly risk of PEDV outbreaks in sow farms based on animal movements and the likelihood of exposure from neighboring farms. We evaluate the relative importance of \u201cneighborhood effects\u201d in determining infection risk, including animal movements into nearby farms, local hog density, environmental factors, and landscape structure. We used machine learning algorithms to model how potential predictors impacted whether a sow farm became infected, referred to as an outbreak, in each one-week period over the course of one year. We also identified the most influential variables on disease risk and evaluated the predictive accuracy of our models for predicting new outbreaks. Our approach for analyzing neighborhood effects on between-farm transmission significantly advances the understanding of PEDV epidemiology and spread and provides a powerful framework for analyzing the joint effect of patterns of animal movement and environmental factors on infection risk in livestock populations.",

For each week, farms were classified as \u201c0\u201d if they were at-risk and thus susceptible to infection, and \u201c1\u201d if they reported clinical PEDV. Our goal was to predict when a farm transitioned from 0 to 1. Once a farm was infected, it was removed from that database as it was no longer considered at-risk. Given the one year duration of the study, farms were not allowed to return to 0. A 10 km radius around a sow farm was defined as a \u201cneighborhood\u201d based on reported distances of potential airborne spread of swine viruses such as PEDV and PRRS25,26,30\u201332. A spatial representation of sow farm neighborhoods and flows of pig movements between these neighborhoods in the first week are plotted in Fig. 3. It is important to note that network visualizations provide a simplified view of the true dynamics of the network, and details of the day-to-day changes in the network and directionality of links are not shown. Further, we represent movements as a straight line (Euclidean distance) between neighborhoods rather than the actual transit distance of trucks on roads. For each sow farm, the 2014 PEDV outbreak history and all animal movements into neighboring farms as well as environmental and landscape variables at the level of the neighborhood was obtained (Fig. 3, see Supplementary Material).",

For the variable importance analysis, the eighteen variables used for model training were ranked according to their contribution to model predictions, as measured by the Gini index which represents the unscaled average decrease in node impurity (Fig. 6A). The variable importance score (Gini Index) represents how relevant each variable was for predicting PEDV outbreaks, with larger values representing more important predictors. We also applied several additional approaches to select the most critical variables for the prediction algorithm. We calculated the \u201caccuracy decrease\u201d as the extent to which the accuracy of predictions changed when an explanatory variable was permuted relative to the outcome (Fig. 6B). In addition, we calculated a p-value for each variable that were hypothesized to influence the occurrence of PEDV outbreaks (Fig. 6B) to evaluate whether it was used in the random forest more often than if variables were selected at random (see methods33,34). The combination of Gini Index and accuracy decrease (see Fig. 6, y-axis: Gini decrease and x-axis: accuracy decrease) shows a natural division in importance amongst variables, with nine variables (highlighted in red in Fig. 6) revealed to be the most critical. The effect of these variables on the outcome was further explored via partial dependence plots, which measured the marginal effect of each variable on the outcome after controlling for the effects of all others.",

The approach presented here provides a realistic understanding of PEDV dynamics by capturing long distance spread via animal movements and linking it with epidemiological factors related to local area spread between neighboring farms. We used machine-learning algorithms to uncover factors most likely to predict PEDV outbreaks, providing crucial information toward more effective preventive actions for minimizing the risk of swine infectious diseases. Key predictors of PEDV included the dynamics of swine movements into a sow farm\u2019s neighborhood as well as environmental conditions, such as wind speed, temperature and precipitation (Fig. 6A). The predictions generated by our model constitute an important baseline for disease surveillance and highlight directions for testable hypotheses about environmental influences on disease spread in the swine industry. If implemented, our results suggest that it could be possible to predict PEDV with substantial accuracy, explaining variation in risk even in areas with high farm density (Fig. 8).",

In contrast to these studies, the uniqueness of our approach is that we moved beyond simply accounting for the focal farm\u2019s position in the movement network, and instead quantified the influence of movements into spatial neighbors. The hypothesis that movement of animals into a neighborhood influences disease risk in locations other than the farm that received the shipment is consistent with anecdotes by field veterinarians that viral outbreaks in a farm often occur soon after pigs were moved into a neighboring farm. While many movements do not originate from PEDV positive farms, the chance of infectious pigs being transported would increase probabilistically with the number of pigs moved. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to capture those local spatial dynamics, which are nearly always overlooked in analyses of livestock movement data. The importance of pigs moving into a neighborhood in our model can be interpreted as increased likelihood of a local introduction of the virus to neighboring farms.",

However, it is interesting to note that even in areas with a high density of farms, our model still captured fine-scale spatial variation in which specific neighborhoods were at higher risk (Fig. 8). In addition, we identified that neighborhoods with higher altitudes and greater slope were more likely to outbreak with PEDV. This is in contrast to a study that investigated altitude and slope in the epidemiology of PRRSV, where farms in areas with higher slope (>5\u00b0) had lower rates of PRRSV outbreaks49. However, the area in which our study was conducted only included landscapes with a maximum of ~2.5\u00b0 slope, which may explain the discrepancy of these results. The model also found that sow farms were at reduced risk when the percent of the neighborhood that was vegetated ranged between 90 and 95%, which is similar to the finding of Arruda et al.49 that showed that PRRSV outbreaks occurred at lower rates in farms that were surrounding by herbaceous cover and trees relative to cultivated or managed land. However, the increase in risk that we found at extremely high levels of vegetation may be due to the fact that we did not differentiate type of vegetation, and it is possible that neighborhoods with extremely high percent vegetation may be cultivated landscapes.",

While only a small number of veterinarians manage the systems included in this study, it is possible that different veterinarians used different criteria to declare outbreaks.

Timely communication of these risks to producers is critical in the prevention of disease spread and targeting of risk mitigation methods (such as air filtration, biosecurity, etc.).
