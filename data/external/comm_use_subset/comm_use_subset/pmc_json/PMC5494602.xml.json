            "text": "Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is an RNA helicase that acts as a major host sensor for virus infections in the cytoplasm (1, 2). Influenza A virus (IAV) infection of cells is detected by RIG-I, which recognizes and binds to the 5\u2032-ppp of the double-stranded RNA structure found within the panhandle of the IAV genome (3, 4). Next, upon binding of viral RNA, RIG-I is activated and undergoes a conformational change mediated by ATPase/Helicase activity, resulting in the exposure of caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD). As the cascade continues, different residues in RIG-I are ubiquitinated by the E3 ligases TRIM25 (5) and RIPLET (6), resulting in RIG-I oligomerization. Subsequently, RIG-I interacts with the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) via their CARD\u2013CARD association, which in turn results in MAVS oligomerization. Through TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) or TRAF6, this leads to activation of the kinase complexes containing TBK1 or IKK\u03b5 and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3. Through several final phosphorylation steps, these kinases ultimately elicit antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses through interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), respectively (7, 8).",

            "text": "Influenza A virus belongs to the orthomyxovirus family, containing eight negative-sense RNA segments in an enveloped viral particle encoding 14 or 17 proteins (9). This array of proteins contributes to virulence; including the proteins associated with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (10) and the non-structural protein 1 (NS1). NS1 consists of 215-237 amino acids and comprises two functional domains: an N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) (AA1 to 73) and a C-terminal effector domain (ED) (AA74-end) (11). The NS1 protein plays a crucial role in regulating the host antiviral response through various mechanisms. One important function of the NS1 protein involves inhibition of IFN production. The mechanism of this inhibition includes activation of the transcription factors IRF3 (12), NF-\u03baB (13), and AP-1 (14), thus blocking IFN production. This efficient inhibitory effect is associated with an RIG-I signaling pathway through the NS1-RIG-I complex (15\u201317). Previous studies have indicated that NS1 is also related to two positive factors of RIG-I, the E3 ligases TRIM25 (18) and RIPLET (19). The residues E96/E97 of NS1 mediate their interaction with the coiled-coil domain of TRIM25, thus blocking both TRIM25 multimerization and RIG-I CARD domain ubiquitination. This subsequently induces lower levels of IFN-\u03b2 (18). NS1 can also interact with RIPLET preventing the activation of RIG-I, although E96/E97 are not involved in that inhibition (19). The dsRNA binding ability of NS1 could also be playing a role in the pre-transcriptional inhibition of the interferon pathway by sequestering the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that RIG-I recognizes. Two residues, R38 and K41, are required for the dsRNA binding activity of NS1 (20), thus highly impairing its ability to block interferon production.",

            "text": "In another similar pathway, NS1 has been shown to inhibit host mRNA synthesis by binding a cellular 3\u2032 end-processing factor, the 30 kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), thus attenuating type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and other interferon stimulated gene (ISG) mRNAs that are involved in the antiviral response (21). The NS1 proteins encoded by the seasonal H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and avian H5N1 viral subtypes strongly bind to CPSF30 (22), whereas PR8, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and novel H7N9 virus do not efficiently bind CPSF30 (23). It is noteworthy that cells infected with viruses expressing NS1 proteins in seasonal H3N2 and H2N2 viruses do not inhibit IRF3 activation. However, activation is blocked in cells infected with viruses expressing NS1 proteins in some, but not all, seasonal H1N1 viruses, 2009 pandemic H1N1, and avian H5N1 viruses. TRIM25 was previously reported to interact with each of these NS1 proteins, whether or not they block IRF3 activation, indicating that binding of TRIM25 by the NS1 protein does not necessarily lead to blocking of IRF3 activation (22). Hence, binding of the NS1 protein to dsRNA, RIG-I, and TRIM25 has not established that these NS1 interactions are responsible for inhibiting the activation of IRF3 and IFN transcription. In this case, one or more host factors may participate in the NS1 blocking of IRF3 activation.",

By using the luciferase reporter assay, we were able to demonstrate that the C-terminal ED (AA126 to 225, named NS1/126-225) of the NS1 protein was sufficient to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 driven by RIG-I(N). Mechanistically, NS1/126-225 was found specifically to interact with TRAF3, to dissociate MAVS\u2013TRAF3 complex, and to decrease K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3. This was shown to result in reduced IRF3-dependent production of IFN-\u03b2, with subsequent enhancement of virus replication. These data reveal a novel mechanism for how the influenza A virus NS1 protein induces inhibition of the host IFN production and may provide a potential target for antiviral drug development.",

In order to investigate the function of wtNS1, and its truncated peptides, we assessed its effect on IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity using a luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells. Our results showed that wtNS1, NS1/74-225, and NS1/126-225 significantly decreased the IFN-\u03b2 reporter activities driven by RIG-I or RIG-I(N). Conversely, NS1/1-73 did not change the activity of IFN-\u03b2 reporter, and NS1/1-125 only slightly increased the activity compared to an empty vector control (Figure 1B). In addition, we found that wtNS1 and all truncated peptides had inhibitory effects on IFN-\u03b2 reporter activities induced by Sev or rNS1-SD30 virus infection or transfection of poly(I:C) (Figure 1B). This suggests that NS1 N-terminal RBD alone is sufficient to inhibit the activation of IFN-\u03b2 only in the presence of dsRNA; the C-terminal ED of NS1 could inhibit the activity of IFN-\u03b2 reporter in all tested conditions. Driven by RIG-I(N), NS1/126-225 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity and IFN-\u03b2 transcription (Figure 1C). Previous studies indicated that IAV NS1 sequesters dsRNA and binds RIG-I at its RBD, subsequently inhibiting the activation of IRF3 and preventing the induction of IFN-\u03b2 (11, 16). Our findings reveal that C-terminal ED of NS1 (NS1/126-225) blocked RIG-I(N)-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction in an RNA binding-independent manner.",

Once IRF3 is phosphorylated, it forms a dimer, translocates into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, and induces the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs through specifically binding to their promoter regions (27). In order to further investigate how NS1/126-225 inhibits the signaling that mediates type I IFN production, we used an IRF3-luciferase reporter plasmid, allowing for the measurement of IRF3 activation. As shown in Figure 2A, IRF3-luciferase reporter activation by RIG-I(N) was blocked in 293T cells overexpressing NS1/126-225 or wtNS1. We next addressed whether NS1/126-225 affected the dimerization and nuclear localization of endogenous IRF3 mediated by RIG-I(N). Non-reduced SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of cell lysates after RIG-I(N) transfection showed that NS1/126-225 or wtNS1 expression produced a considerable reduction in the activated dimer form of IRF3 (Figure 2B). Similarly, RIG-I(N)-induced phosphorylation of IRF3 was strongly repressed by NS1/126-225 or wtNS1 and that phosphorylated IRF3 was largely distributed in nuclear fractions (Figure 2C). ELISA assays of IFN-\u03b2 in the medium of cells transfected with plasmids encoding NS1/126-225 or wtNS1 along with RIG-I(N) showed that both NS1/126-225 and wtNS1 inhibited the production of IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 2D). Together, these data indicate that NS1/126-225 inhibits the expression of type I IFN induced by RIG-I(N) through blocking the phosphorylation of IRF3.",

IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity and transcription levels of IFN-\u03b2 were then detected. Reporter assay results showed that NS1/126-225 inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 activity induced by RIG-I(N) or MAVS, whereas NS1/126-225 could not suppress IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation driven by TBK1, IKK\u03b5, or IRF3(5D) (Figure 3A).

Thus, we hypothesized that TRAF3 is the target of NS1/126-225. Co-IP experiments revealed that NS1/126-225 interacted selectively with TRAF3 but not other components (Figures 4A,B). In another experiment, wtNS1 and NS1/74-225 also interacted most potently with TRAF3 (Figure 4C). This association was confirmed under physiological conditions in an experiment that detected this interaction by overexpression of Flag-TRAF3 in infected A549 cells, where RIG-I served as a positive control (Figure 4D). Furthermore, PR8 NS1 also interacted with TRAF3 in infected A549 cells (Figure 4E). To address whether the wtNS1 protein physically interacts with endogenous TRAF3, we performed endogenous IP assays on H5N1/HM or PR8-infected cell lysates. Our results showed that TRAF3 could be co-precipitated by the NS1 antibody (Figure 4F). In addition, the NS1 proteins of the strain A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9) and other avian H9N2 strain did not bind TRAF3 (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). These results demonstrate that NS1/126-225 or wtNS1 interacts with TRAF3 in a strain-specific manner.",

Compared to the control, NS1/126-225 reduced the RIG-I(N)-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 (Figure 6, left). To explore the type of TRAF3 ubiquitin chains, Flag-TRAF3 was transfected into 293T cells with ubiquitin mutants, including the pUb-K48-HA or pUb-K63-HA expression plasmid. The results showed that NS1/126-225 could decrease the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 but not the K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 (Figure 6, right).

Therefore, it was necessary to test whether wtNS1 or NS1/126-225 affect this process to accomplish its negative regulatory role in IFN-\u03b2 production after Sev infection. The interaction of MAVS and IKK\u03b5 was readily detected by Co-IP, while Sev infection resulted in a significant decrease in the MAVS\u2013IKK\u03b5 interaction. Interestingly, the interaction of MAVS and IKK\u03b5 was remarkably increased when cotransfected with NS1/126-225 or wtNS1 (Figure 7E), indicating that NS1/126-225 or NS1 promotes the recruitment of IKK\u03b5 to MAVS.

RIG-I recognizes and binds dsRNA structures with 5\u2032-triphosphates upon infection to initiate the host antiviral response. During the course of viral infection, the NS1 protein of IAV inhibits host IFN responses either by sequestering viral dsRNA or by binding to RIG-I and TRIM25 or RIPLET proteins required for RIG-I activation and IFN signaling pathways (11, 16, 18, 19). In this study, we found that the NS1 C-terminal ED (AA126 to 225) of H5N1 virus inhibits the activation of IFN-\u03b2 pathway. To achieve a negative regulatory function in the cellular antiviral response, NS1/126-225 associates with TRAF3 to remove the Lys63-polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3 and to disrupt the MAVS\u2013TRAF3 complex. NS1/126-225 also increases the recruitment of IKK\u03b5 to MAVS, releasing TRAF3 from the mitochondria. This further decreases the level of K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3, impairing IRF3 phosphorylation and reducing the production of IFN-\u03b2 (Figure 9).",

Typically, the RBD of NS1 mediates the inhibition of IFN synthesis, and the ED of NS1 induces the inhibition of gene expression, together with its known interactors (11). In this study, we have found that the NS1 C-terminal ED (NS1/74-225 and NS1/126-225), but not the RBD (NS1/1-73 and NS1/1-125) block IFN-\u03b2 reporter activity induced by RIG-I(N). Expression of NS1/126-225 resulted in the inhibition of IRF3 activation, indicating that the NS1 protein blocks IFN-\u03b2 activation through an RNA-independent manner. It was demonstrated in previous studies that influenza A viruses TX/98 and A/Viet Nam/1203/04 expressing C-terminally truncated NS1 proteins of 73, 99, or 126 amino acids were attenuated. The resultant reduced growth correlated with a high level of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induced by these mutant viruses (28, 38). In addition, in both influenza B and C viruses, the C-terminal domains of the NS1 proteins were found to possess IFN antagonist activity (39, 40). More importantly, the N terminus-truncated NS1 proteins encoded by PR8, which was translated from internal AUGs at positions 235 and 241 of the NS1 open reading frame, were found to inhibit the activation of IRF3 and IFN-\u03b2 transcription (41). This observation is supported by our findings that the influenza A virus NS1 ED plays an important role in the ability of the NS1 protein to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 pathway.",

For this purpose, we examined a step within the signaling pathway that NS1/126-225 targets and found that NS1/126-225 acted downstream of MAVS and upstream of TBK1. The Co-IP assays showed unexpectedly that NS1/126-225 binds to TRAF3, which interacts with MAVS forming a platform for RNA virus signaling. We also tested the binding of TRAF3 to the full-length NS1 protein and found that this interaction exists, and co-localized in the cytoplasm. The NS1/126-225 protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm. TRAF3 expression led to a marked increase in the NS1/126-225 cytoplasmic localization, suggesting that NS1/126-225 inhibits the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 pathway. Although all types of influenza virus NS1 proteins interact with TRIM25, only part of NS1 prevents IRF3 activation, indicating that TRIM25 is not required for the inhibition of IRF3 activation. In this study, we did not observe the interaction between NS1/126-225 and RIG-I, consistent with the results described in a previous publication (41). Consequently, RIG-I seems to be non-essential for the optimal inhibition of IFN production in IAV-infected cells. However, our study demonstrated that the influenza A virus NS1 ED targets TRAF3, subsequently inhibits IFN production, implying that TRAF3 is a key factor involved for IAV to escape host innate immune responses.",

TRAF3 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and needs to be recruited to mitochondrial MAVS in order to activate TBK1 complexes (44). Many viral proteins, accessory and non-structural proteins in particular, hijack TRAF3 or the TRAF3 complex to mediate immune evasion. SARS coronavirus M protein or Open Reading Frame-9b prevents the formation of TRAF3\u2013TANK\u2013TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complex or MAVS\u2013TRAF3/TRAF6 signalosome to evade host innate immunity (45, 46). SARS-CoV papain-like protease interacts with and disrupts STING\u2013TRAF3\u2013TBK1 complex, it also inhibits the TLR7-mediated innate immunity through removing Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6 (47, 48). Herpes simplex virus 1 ubiquitin-specific protease UL36 deubiquitinates TRAF3 then counteracts the IFN-\u03b2 pathway (49). Over the past 10 years, there have been major advances in understanding how influenza A viruses successfully escape the surveillance of the immune system. The current report furthers this research revealing the surprising finding that NS1/126-225 acts by targeting TRAF3; specifically, NS1/126-225 targets the TRAF domain of TRAF3. TRAF3 links the upstream IFN signaling responses of MAVS to TBK1 relying on the TRAF domain. This report also shows that a specific interaction between TRAF3 and MAVS was observed when TRAF3 and MAVS were co-expressed in 293T cells. However, the interaction between TRAF3 and MAVS was disrupted in the presence of NS1/126-225. Interestingly, the interaction between MAVS and IKK\u03b5 was markedly increased in NS1/126-225-expressing cells. It has been previously demonstrated that, after Sev infection, K63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys500 of MAVS recruits IKK\u03b5 to the mitochondria, functionally causes release of TRAF3 from MAVS initiating the signal to shutdown the IFN response (31). The MAVS\u2013IKK\u03b5 complex was enhanced when NS1/126-225 was present, indicating that NS1/126-225 can utilize this process to shut down further activation of IFN pathway. Taken together, these data indicate that NS1/126-225 impedes the interactions between components of MAVS\u2013TRAF3 complex, preventing the phosphorylation of IRF3, where it would activate the IFN-\u03b2 response.",

TRAF3, serving as a crucial functional link, is modified with a polyubiquitin chain providing a scaffold for complex formation, and, not surprisingly, many viruses encode proteins that inhibit ubiquitination processes to overcome host innate responses. Previous studies showed that nairoviruses and arteriviruses encode for ovarian tumor domain-containing proteases that hydrolyze ubiquitin chains from host proteins (50, 51). In this report, we have shown that NS1/126-225 suppresses the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3. It is likely that NS1/126-225 works through recruiting a deubiquitinase to cleave the TRAF3 ubiquitin chain since it has been shown that NS1/126-225 does not belong to any known deubiquitinase family. For example, DUBA, a member of the Otubain (OTUB) family, has been shown to deubiquitinate TRAF3 and negatively regulate TLR3- and RIG-I/MDA5-mediated IFN induction (52). It was also shown that two OTUB deubiquitinating enzyme family members, OTUB1 and OTUB2, can deubiquitinate TRAF3 and TRAF6, leading to the inhibition of virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 expression and cellular antiviral responses (53). Therefore, whether these proteins, or other DUB proteins, are involved in this regulation, and the detailed regulatory mechanism of TRAF3 activity triggered by NS1/126-225 remains to be discovered.",

However, premature stop codons or, alternatively, suppression of the genuine stop codon (codon 231) resulted in length variations at NS1\u2019s C-terminus. Abdelwhab et al. analyzed NS1 protein sequences of all AIV subtypes in birds from 1902 to 2015 to study the prevalence and distribution of carboxyl terminal end truncation (\u0394CTE). They found that NS217 proteins lacking amino acids 218-230 were the most prevalent form (88%). This truncation is prevalent in LPAIV of non-H5/H7 subtypes; particularly H9N2, H10, and H6 viruses that are known to be widespread and mostly (semi)endemic in land-based poultry (54). Similar truncations have also been observed in swine influenza viruses, which harbor a C-terminally truncated NS1 and have also been found in human H1N1 viruses that have been in public circulation since the 2009 pandemic (55). Hence, whether the interaction of NS1 and TRAF3 are associated with the \u0394CTE requires further investigation.",

Following IAV infection, RIG-I recognizes and binds 5\u2032-triphosphate dsRNA to initiate host antiviral response. The NS1 protein of IAV inhibits host IFN responses either by sequestering viral dsRNA or by binding to RIG-I and TRIM25 or RIPLET proteins required for RIG-I activation. In addition, the NS1 C-terminal effector domain (AA126 to 225, NS1/126-225) associates with TRAF3 to remove the Lys63-polyubiquitin chains on TRAF3 and to disrupt the MAVS\u2013TRAF3 complex. NS1/126-225 also increases the recruitment of IKK\u03b5 to MAVS. This releases TRAF3 from the mitochondria, further decreasing the level of K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and impairing IRF3 phosphorylation.
