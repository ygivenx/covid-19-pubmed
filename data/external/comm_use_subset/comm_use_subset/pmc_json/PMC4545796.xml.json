            "text": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease that usually affects infants and young children under 5 years of age worldwide. HFMD typically causes self-limiting illness, but development of severe cardiopulmonary and neurologic complications have also been reported [1, 2]. The clinical manifestations are typically ulcerations in the oral cavity, buccal mucosa (enanthema) and tongue with peripherally distributed cutaneous lesions and vesicular rash (exanthema) on the palms of hands and soles of feet. Other parts of the limbs including knees, elbows and buttocks may also be affected. Transmission occurs via person-to-person through direct contact with respiratory secretion, saliva, fluid from blisters, and feces from infected individuals. A number of enteroviruses belonging to the family Picornaviridae cause HFMD, although human enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus (CV) type A16 are two of the most important enteroviruses implicated in many large-scale outbreaks in Asian-Pacific countries including Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and China [2\u20134]. Additional enterovirus species including CV-A6, CV-A10 and CV-A4 also cause HFMD [5\u20139]. Clinical symptoms resulting from CV-A16 as well as other enteroviruses are usually relatively mild and indistinguishable with low incidence of severe complications. In contrast, serious complications such as encephalitis, myocarditis, and poliomyelitis-like illness were observed when EV71 were reported as the causative pathogen [10\u201312].",

            "text": "HFMD has been continuously present and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality of young children particularly in Asia. Typically, HFMD exhibits cyclical pattern of outbreaks every two to three years. Factors underlying the prevalence of HFMD remain controversial. Data from countries with long history of HFMD outbreaks suggest that dissemination is associated with socio-economic status, population ethnicity [13], regional climate [14\u201316], and attendance in school or care centers of school-age children [17]. The magnitude of HFMD outbreaks appears to fluctuate [3, 18, 19]. HFMD in tropical climate countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, typically showed years-round activity with no discrete epidemic periods although peaks during the rainy and winter seasons were also detected depending on season, year, and geographic regions [20, 21]. At present, no specific treatment for HFMD exists. Vaccines or antiviral drug against EV71 are currently being developed in Taiwan, China and Singapore but are not yet commercially available [22\u201324]. Prompted by geographically widespread outbreaks, careful monitoring of the spatial and temporal epidemiology is considered to be of great importance to control the spread of HFMD according to the different regional characteristics. As reported by the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand, HFMD has shown an upward trend in the last five to six years. In June 2012, the largest recorded outbreak of HFMD occurred throughout the country. This outbreak affected more than 39,000 individuals, including three deaths, over a period of four to five months with hot spots in Chiang Rai and Mae Hong Son provinces [25]. In our previous study, we monitored HFMD activity in Thailand between 2008 and 2012. Our results revealed that the HFMD epidemic in 2012 was significantly different from previous ones in Thailand including the size of the epidemic and the viruses detected [26, 27]. During the 2012 epidemic, beside a high prevalence of EV71 and CV-A16, multiple EV types such as CV-A6 were also detected. Even though the standardized 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) pan-enterovirus PCR and viral capsid protein 1 (VP1) gene typing PCR assays were used [27], approximately one third of the suspected cases, mostly young children, were negative for enterovirus by these assays. These findings raised questions regarding the sensitivity of the current assay in identifying causative viruses other than EV71 and CV-A16 that may be present below the limit of detection by conventional PCR. In recent years, metagenomic has become an important strategy for virus discovery in human and animal diseases [28\u201330]. This technique, based on recognition of sequence similarities following non-specific nucleic acid amplification, circumvents some of the limitations of virus isolation, serology, and the amplification of only known conserved genomic regions [31]. To evaluate circulating enterovirus and previously uncharacterized viruses associated with HFMD, we describe here the virus community (virome) in fecal samples negative by RT-PCR for EV71 and CV-A16/A6 obtained from 29 pediatric patients with HFMD during the outbreak in Thailand in 2012.",

The inclusion criterion for patient enrollment has been described elsewhere [26, 32]. All samples were previously tested using a 5' UTR pan-enterovirus and EV71, CV-A16/A6 specific VP1 PCRs and found to be PCR negative for enteroviruses [27]. Demographic information of the patients for the 29 selected patients is summarized in Table 1. The HFMD patients were between 8 months and 5 years old (1 male: 1.4 female). Stool was suspended in 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution and subjected to a vigorous vortex to yield fecal supernatants. Then 140 \u03bcl of fecal supernatant from each of 29 HFMD patient samples were mixed into three pools, designated as HFMD-lib01 (10 samples), HFMD-lib02 (10 samples), and HFMD-lib03 (9 samples). The sample pools were centrifuged at 12,000x g and the supernatants were adjusted to 2 ml final volume using PBS. The pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm membrane (Millipore, MA, USA) to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial-cell-sized particle and to enrich for viral contents. The filtrates were concentrated using ultracentrifugation at 22,000 x g for 2 hours and the pellets were resuspended with 100 \u03bcl 1X PBS. To eliminate host genome and other non-viral nucleic acids, a mixture of DNases [Turbo DNase (Life Technologies, NY, USA) and Baseline-ZERO (Epicentre, WI, USA)] and RNase (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) were added to 120 \u03bcl of the concentrated suspension to the final volume of 140 \u03bcl followed by enzymatic digestion at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hours. Viral particle-protected nucleic acids were then extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Total nucleic acids were eluted in 25\u03bcl RNase free water (Life Technologies, NY, USA).",

The libraries were enriched by 15 cycles of PCR amplification. During the amplification, different tagged random primers containing short nucleotides signature at the 3\u2032-end of the primers (barcodes) were used to assign sequences to the corresponding pool. Finally, amplified adaptor-tagged libraries were further cleaned up by using Agencourt AMPure magnetic bead purification followed by library quantification using KAPA library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, MA, USA). The purified products from the three pools were combined in equal concentrations and subjected to sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform (Illumina, CA, USA)",

Only enterovirus (EV) species A to D and rhinovirus are human viruses. EV infections primarily cause diseases in the alimentary and respiratory tract, sometimes with manifestation in the central nervous system, most frequently in infants and young children [39]. EV-like sequences could be characterized abundantly in the pooled clinical samples including sequences most closely related to EV species A, B and D (2,142 reads) and rhinovirus (1,772 reads) (Fig 2). Approximately 45.9% (1,797/3,914) of enterovirus sequences were similar to several types within EV species A including CV-A21 [74.3% (1,336/1,797)] (Fig 2). In general, CV-A21 infection is thought to cause mild illness and is not typically associated with HFMD. The CV-A21 sequences identified in this study shared 80%-97% nucleotide identity, depending on the genomic region, to previous strains in the GenBank database. Other EV species A related sequences included 24.1% CV-A10 (433), 0.9% CV- A16 (17), 0.3% CV-A8 (6), and 0.2% EV71 (3) (Table 1). Sequences homologous to EV species B constituted 16% (342) of enterovirus reads, including CV-B1 (125) and echovirus (Echo) type 3 (17). On the basis of sequence similarity, another 200 reads were classified as EV-B but were unassignable to a specific type. In addition to EV BLAST analysis results, three nucleotide sequences from the lib01 pool, which could be assembled into a 371 nt long contig (accession number KP242036), were assigned to EV species D type 68 VP1 gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that EV68-lib01clustered with the previous reported strain identified from many countries worldwide with more than 92% nucleotide identity (Fig 3).",

Phylogenetic analyses of the viral capsid genes VP4/VP2 and VP1 and 5\u2032UTR suggested that the HRV-related sequence strain from pooled HFMD clinical samples formed a unique branch with HRV-Cc subspecies.

First identified in 2007 from a child with febrile illness, SAFV are found in the stool of children with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis and healthy children in Pakistan [34]. However, pathogenicity and clinical relevance of SAFV infection remain to be fully elucidated. SAFV replicates efficiently in the alimentary tract and is transmitted through oral-fecal route, consistent with possible association with gastrointestinal tract illnesses and diarrhea [49]. Infections by SAFV might also contribute to more severe symptoms in children such as HFMD-associated encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, and aseptic meningitis [50\u201353]. In this study, SAFV-related sequences were found in two HFMD pools, contributing to the third most picornavirus sequence reads detected [16.8% (792/4,706)] after HRV-C and CV-A21. Amongst the SAFV-like sequences, two contigs (5,405 nt and 524 nt) and a singlet (176 nt) were recovered from a sample pool. Together, these sequences spanned approximately 75% of the entire genome and encompassed partial L protein encoding region (176 nt), VP2 through 3C (5,405 nt), and the 3\u2032end of 3C through 3\u2032UTR (524 nt) (Table 2). BLAST searches of full-length sequences and phylogenetic analysis of the individual regions suggest that these samples contained a genotype similar to the strain JPN404 from Japan (HQ902242). Sequences shared 87.1%-98.6% nucleotide identity with other SAFV3 cardioviruses. The overall nucleotide identity in the partial polyproteins 1 (P1) and P2 regions to other SAFV genotypes were 66.3%-68.9% and 72.2%-90.6%, respectively.

Results showed that the SAFV-like sequence appeared to result from intertypic recombination between SAFV2 (major parent: EU681176) and SAFV3 (minor parent: EU681178) (Fig 4, Table 3 and S2 Table). The SAFV-like sequence shared 93.8% nucleotide identity to SAFV3 in the P1 region (p < 0.05). These similarity patterns were also observed for the strain JPN404. Based on boot-scanning analysis, the presence of one putative recombination breakpoint was detected within the beginning of 2A gene (around nucleotide position 1,871 of the contig or position 3,936 of the strain JPN404). Our findings together with recent reports on SAFV genetic diversity [54, 55], suggest the important role of recombination in the emergence of SAFV genotypes and strains.",

HBoV-like sequences were found in the HFMD01 pool (HBoV-lib01), constituting 15.2% (1,291/8,482) of total virus reads in HFMD.

Towards this, we tested each sample for the virus identified from the most frequent virus reads found in each pool using RT-PCR. For HFMD-lib01, we found one sample positive for CV-A16 after conventional sequencing and BLAST analysis, while the rest of the samples in this pool tested negative. In pool HFMD-lib02, which showed high number of reads for rhinovirus-C, we also found that only one sample tested positive for rhinovirus. Finally, we identified one sample positive for CV-A21 in HFMD-lib03 pool. Taken together, these results verified that the presence of enterovirus originated from a unique sample and contributed to the high number of reads observed in each pool.",

Analysis of the sequences either assembled into contigs or as singletons revealed a complexity of the virus population. Although previous examination of these samples did not initially detect enteroviruses using PCR-based assays, the present study utilizing deep sequencing enabled the detection of enterovirus sequences as well as other enteric virus at concentration as low as a few genome copies, providing a more systematic analysis of the prevalence of the viral genome.",

In addition to the commonly identified EV71 and CV-A16, other enteroviruses have been reported to cause HFMD outbreaks in different countries including CV-A10 and CV-A6 in Finland [5] and France [80] in 2010 and in China during 2008\u20132012 [81]. CV-A21 was least reported to cause HFMD with only 42 detections throughout the 36 years of surveillance in the United States [8]. However, a study in China cited a high incidence rate of CV-A21 infection in adults with RTI [82]. Another rarely detected virus found was EV68, originally isolated in the USA in 1962 from patients with RTI [83] and has been detected sporadically thereafter. EV68 is unusual among EV in that it shares phenotypic properties of both enterovirus and rhinovirus [84]. Reports suggested that this virus was associated with RTI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis with greater severity in infant and school-aged children. Between 2008 and 2010, an increasing number of EV68 clusters in cases of RTI have been reported worldwide [85\u201388]. Outbreaks have also been reported in the USA in 2014 when EV68 infection affected more than a thousand people, mostly young children and resulting in at least 12 deaths. The association of EV68 infection and diseases other than RTI remains uncertain. Studies have linked the virus with infection of the central nervous system including acute flaccid paralysis [8] and fatal meningomyeloencephalitis [89]. In addition, by using un-biased metagenomic analysis, our results not only expanded the number of identified types of enterovirus, both common and rare, but also revealed possible circulation of multiple enterovirus types during the outbreak.",

No role for HRV has been postulated for HFMD and the virus is typically present in respiratory secretion and associated with asthma exacerbation [93].

Our study found enterovirus, cardiovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and picobirnavirus in stools from pediatric HFMD patients. Several of these viruses are known to cause gastrointestinal diseases. Although co-infections with different viruses and correlates of disease severity are ongoing, it is conceivable that viral co-infections may aggravate clinical manifestation of an otherwise mild virus infection, which could result in compromised gut function and upregulated immune response leading to increased risk of morbidity. For example, during an HFMD outbreak in Sarawak, Malaysia in 1997, a subgroup of adenovirus and enterovirus were isolated from three fatal cases [108]. It is therefore conceivable that co-infection could precipitate or aggravate HFMD symptoms. Future studies to examine viral profile in individual clinical samples are warranted to clarify the possible role of co-infection with disease severity.",

Although stool samples used in this study were convenient samples collected for our previous study, inclusion of other clinical specimens such as throat swab, vesicular fluid, and skin lesions would be ideal. Stool samples may harbor unknown inhibitors of PCR and present nucleic acids of non-viral origin, thus complicating analysis. Nevertheless, our findings highlight the potential advantage of next generation sequencing to detect viruses from clinical specimens, which may be present below the limit of detection by conventional PCR assay.
