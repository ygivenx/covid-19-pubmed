Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 is the part of the oxyanion loop that participates in maintaining the correct conformation of the S1 subsite in the active enzyme. In contrast, in inactive enzymes, this short peptide forms a short 310-helix that twists the oxyanion hole of the S1 subsite (Fig. 1). This same conformational change is also observed in the collapsed 3CLpro of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV-3CLpro)5.",

In the present work, we mutated Leu141 to Thr141, a residue with strong \u03b2-structure and low helix tendency.

Under our experimental condition, 18.5 \u03bcM GLRQ was totally inhibited by 160 \u03bcM 5f (Supplemental Fig. S3), which implies that the substrate binding pocket of the GLRQ mutant maintains the active conformation. In addition, when 10 \u03bcM 5f was incubated with 5 \u03bcM GLRQ in PBS and analysed using the sedimentation velocity experiment described above, no peaks were induced except for the monomer peak (Supplemental Fig. S4).

Its enzymatic-specific activity, kcat/Km, increases with an increase in enzyme concentration92122, which provides evidence that further dimerization can be induced by the substrate during hydrolysis. Furthermore, a previous study has shown upward curvature in the reaction rate versus enzyme concentration plots for 3CLpro23. We measured the enzyme activity of GLRQ at different enzyme concentrations, and found that the velocity increases in a linear manner with an increase in enzyme concentration, which is in contrast to the activity of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5A). Although GLRQ hydrolyses the colorimetric pNA substrate with a lower efficiency than the wild-type proteinase, the reaction rate increases proportionally with a positive slope that goes through the origin; i.e., kcat/Km did not change with enzyme concentration (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that the enzyme is active as a monomer with no occurrence of substrate-induced dimerization.",

We analysed the packing between these two residues using two measurements: the distance and the cosine of the dihedral angle between the imidazole ring of His163 and the phenyl ring of Phe140 (Fig. 6). In the Monomer system, the distance between His163 and Phe140 is approximately 9 \u00c5. In the first chain of the WT system (WT Chain A), the side chains of His163 and Phe140 are well packed. The distance is approximately 4 \u00c5 and the cosine is close to \u22121, which means that the rings adopt a face-to-face conformation. These two conformations observed in the Monomer system and WT Chain A represent the inactive and active state of the catalytic site, respectively. In the second chain of the WT system (WT Chain B), the distance is approximately 5 \u00c5 and the cosine is shifted to 1. The distribution in MutantW is between the distributions in WT Chains A and B, with two minima at cosine values of \u22121 and 1, respectively. Although the MutantM system originates from the Monomer system, the MutantM system has a local minimum at a distance of 6 \u00c5 and a cosine of 0. This minimum may represent an intermediate state of the inactive-active transition. These results indicate that the conformations of His163 and Phe140 in the mutants fall between the active and inactive state.",

For the mutant GLRQ, the loop conformation and active site structure transitioned between inactive and active structures regardless of whether the simulation started from an inactive conformation or an active conformation. Because the three mutations, G11A, R298A, and Q299A, stabilize the monomer structure, the only mutation in the Ser139-Leu141 loop, L141T, was deduced to be the major driving force that destabilizes the 310-helix towards the active loop conformation. This single mutation may not be sufficient to achieve a highly active enzyme, however. More mutations may be necessary to increase the activity of GLRQ.

Why does nature select the dimer structure as the active form for SARS-3CLpro when multiple strategies for enzyme activity regulation are available? Our current study provides more evidence that the virus needs a main proteinase to process its viral polyprotein at the appropriate time. A previous study has shown that the substrate can enhance SARS-3CLpro dimerization21. During the viral replication process, the enzyme modulates its activity to control the digestion process as the amount of polyproteins change via dimer association and dissociation22. In addition to maintaining enzyme activity, SARS-3CLpro also needs to tune its activity according to the substrate concentration. The SARS virus may use this strategy to simultaneously prepare proteins that are necessary for assembly.",
