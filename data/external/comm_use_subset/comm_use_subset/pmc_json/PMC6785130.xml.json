In recent years, an increase in TBEV infection rates in affected countries and in its geographical distribution has been observed, involving previously unaffected areas such as Switzerland and northern Germany [4\u20136]. Although the disease is not always fatal (mortality rate of 1\u20132%), a high percentage of patients (35\u201358%) suffer from permanent sequelae, such as cognitive or neuropsychiatric afflictions, balance disorders, headaches, dysphasia, hearing defects, and spinal paralysis after overcoming the main symptoms [2, 7]. Specific antiviral therapy for tick-borne encephalitis does not exist. Neurons are the primary target for TBEV infection in mice and humans, and according to post mortem studies of TBEV-infected patients, the cerebellum is one of the main foci affected [8\u201310]. Understanding the interaction between TBEV and human neural cells is essential as it could lead to possible new treatment targets and a better understanding of why TBEV infection can result in severe neurological symptoms. Like all flaviviruses, TBEV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of positive polarity (approx. 11 kb) with a 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5\u00b4end. The coding segment is flanked on both ends by untranslated regions (UTR). Viral proteins are encoded in a single open reading frame that is translated in one poly-protein which is then proteolytically processed into three structural (C, prM, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) [11\u201313]. While the structural proteins are the main building units of the viral particle, the non-structural proteins are crucial in the TBEV life cycle. They are essential components of viral replication within the host endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus-derived membrane compartments and the virion assembly processes and are involved in immune response evasion/counteractions [14\u201316].",

There are various strategies viruses use to accomplish this goal and generally aim at three levels: host translational shut-off, processing of host mRNA, and host transcriptional shut-off [17, 18]. Translation of eukaryotic and viral proteins is often controlled at the rate-limiting step of initiation and viruses such as Bunyamwera virus, influenza A virus or poliovirus were shown to target initiation factors [19\u201323]. More specifically for flaviviruses, a recent study [24] documented repression of the host translation initiation step during DENV infection and general translational repression was also recorded for WNV and ZIKV. While inducing host translational shut-off, viral proteins are still synthesised thanks to alternative translation initiation strategies, such as cap-independent translation [20, 25\u201327].",

Each of the RNA polymerase complexes is responsible for the transcription of different genes. RNA polymerase I (POLR1) yields a single transcription unit 45-47S pre-rRNA, which undergoes a complex maturation process that generates 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA [28, 29]. RNA polymerase III (POLR3) produces 5S rRNA, tRNAs, and specific small RNAs [29]. RNA polymerase II (POLR2) transcribes protein-coding genes and certain small RNAs [30]. Out of all the transcripts synthesised in the eukaryotic cell, ribosomal RNA is the most abundant and a key component of ribosomes. Virus-induced interference with transcription and subsequent processing of host rRNA has been described for influenza A virus [31], herpes simplex virus type I [32], human papillomavirus type 8 [33], human cytomegalovirus [34], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [35].

DAOY HTB-186 cell line is derived from desmoplastic cerebellar medulloblastoma of a 4-year-old Caucasian male [36]. A549s are derived from a lung cancerous tissue (alveolar basal epithelial cells) of a 58-year-old Caucasian male [37]. Vero cells are derived from kidney epithelial cells from African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops). PS cells (porcine kidney stable) were grown in L15 medium with 3% new-born calf serum (NCS), 1% antibiotics-antimycotics, and 1% L-alanyl-L-glutamine [38]. The human osteosarcoma cell line MG-63 (Sigma-Aldrich) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics-antimycotics, 1% L-alanyl-L-glutamine, and 50 nM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol.

Metabolic labelling with 5-EU was performed for 2 hours. Cell viability was measured as described earlier. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed using RNA Blue reagent. Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Next, RNA was separated in MOPS-buffered denaturing gel, as described above. The quantity of RNA was normalised to the cell number. Capillary blotting of RNA to the PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) using 20\u00d7 SSC buffering system was performed afterwards. Subsequently, the modified detection method Click-on-membrane was performed according to the method described by Ko\u010dov\u00e1 et. al. (in preparation). Briefly, the UV-fixed membrane was washed in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and the Click reaction on membrane was performed as follows: membranes were incubated in Click reaction buffer (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 with 0.25 mM sodium ascorbate, 0.5 mM THPTA, 0.1 mM CuSO4, and 10 \u03bcM picolyl biotin azide) for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature. Blocking and triple labelling using biotin-streptavidin system was performed as described above. The chemiluminescence signal was developed using Novex CDP-Star kit (Invitrogen; #WP20002), and signal was subsequently quantified using Fiji software [46].",

In order to establish whether TBEV also affects translation, de novo protein synthesis kinetics was measured in TBEV-infected cells using Click chemistry [49]. For this purpose, we utilized a suitable in vitro experimental system of the cerebellum-derived human medulloblastoma cell line DAOY HTB-186 to broaden previous findings [47]. Two closely related members of the European subtype of TBEV with different virulence were used for comparative purposes: a medium virulent prototype strain, Neudoerfl, and a highly virulent strain, Hypr [41]. Initially, we characterized the course of infection for both TBEV strains. DAOY cells were infected at an MOI of 5 with either strain and at 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 hours p.i., replication kinetics, infection rate, viral protein (C, NS3) production and viability of infected cells were determined. Both strains successfully replicated in DAOY cells, with the Hypr strain reaching at least one order of magnitude higher titres during the course of infection until 48 hours p.i., when both strains eventually produced equal titres (Fig 1A). The infection rate was also considerably higher for the Hypr strain, culminating at 36 hours p.i. (87.5% of infected cells), whereas the Neudoerfl strain infected only 43.6% of cells (Fig 1A). Relative quantification of genomic RNA at 24 and 48 hours p.i. revealed that Hypr replicated with higher efficiency than Neudoerfl (Fig 1B). TBEV C and TBEV NS3 protein detection corresponded to replication kinetics and for both strains proteins could be detected earliest at 18 hours p.i., increasing thereafter (Fig 1C). While TBEV Neudoerfl affected the viability of the infected cells only mildly (maximal decrease by 16.6% at 36 hours p.i.), TBEV Hypr lowered the viability of the infected cells by 23.8% and 62.5% in comparison to mock-infected control at 36 and 48 hours p.i., respectively (Fig 1D). Therefore, in order to compensate the potential bias originating from cell death, we standardised our experiments to viability which is directly proportional to the number of living cells (S1 Fig). In the following experiments we pursued interaction of TBEV with DAOY cells during the period of productive infection for both TBEV strains, ranging from 24 to 48 hours p.i.",

Viperin mRNA, as well as protein levels, were analysed at 12 hours post-transfection (S3A Fig). As a control, GFP expression construct was used. S3B Fig shows that viperin protein was produced; however, the protein levels were significantly reduced in TBEV-infected cells compared to control cells. Hypr strain infection also resulted in a statistically significant decrease in mRNA levels of viperin. As expected, GFP production in TBEV infected cells was negatively affected in case of both TBEV strains (S3C Fig). Again, Hypr strain infection also caused a significant decrease in GFP mRNA. Consequently, TBEV induces a general translational shut-off, which can negatively affect even the production of overexpressed transcripts.

There are several hallmarks typical for nucleolar stress including disruption of nucleolus structure [51]. We, therefore, characterised the localization and production of nascent RNA at the cellular level and also investigated the structure of the nucleolus. DAOY cells infected with TBEV Hypr strain were analysed at 24, 36, and 48 hours p.i. using in situ Click reaction with 10 \u03bcM picolyl biotin azide and subsequent visualisation via streptavidin conjugated with DyLight-549. As shown in Fig 5D, the overall production of nascent RNA in TBEV-infected cells started to decrease from 36 hours p.i.; de novo synthesised RNA was exclusively detected in nuclei with foci of nascent RNA molecules localised in nucleoli. In addition, these nascent RNA foci were not structurally altered upon TBEV infection. The specificity of the labelling reaction was determined using EU-unlabelled cells in the Click reaction (S5A Fig). In order to further verify that TBEV did not induce nucleolar re-arrangement due to nucleolar stress, we analysed the nucleolar structure upon TBEV Hypr infection using nucleophosmin (NPM1; a nucleolar marker). As a positive control, cells were treated with 1 mM H2O2 for 45 minutes. No disruption of nucleoli in TBEV-infected cells was observed (S5B Fig). These data imply that TBEV inhibits 45-47S pre-rRNA production without triggering the nucleolar stress pathway.",

Nevertheless, POLR1 protein levels were impaired in TBEV Hypr-infected cells at 48 hours p.i. This may be a result of the previously mentioned translational shut-off since it coincided at 48 hours p.i. Besides, POLR1 mRNA levels were negatively affected by TBEV infection, too (Fig 6C).

We analysed the rate of rRNA production in DAOY cells after treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of translation elongation. First, we determined the time- and dosage-dependent effect of CHX in DAOY cells using a Renilla (RL) luciferase-based reporter system. DAOY cells were first transfected with pRL-CMV and treated with CHX (50, 100, and 300 \u03bcg/ml). As shown in S6 Fig, all CHX concentrations tested decreased the production of luciferase. Moreover, the inhibition rate of luciferase production increased with longer exposure to CHX. Next, rRNA production in DAOY cells with decreased translational rate was assessed. Cells were treated with CHX (100 \u03bcg/ml) for 6 or 14 hours and de novo RNA synthesis in CHX-treated cells was subsequently determined. Fig 7A shows a statistically significant decrease in levels of nascent 45-47S pre-rRNA for both intervals. In particular, the levels decreased to 22 \u00b1 9% or 56 \u00b1 16% during CHX treatment for 14 or 6 hours, respectively. In addition, total levels of mature 18S and 28S rRNAs were quantified in CHX-treated cells. Significant decreases in 18S rRNA levels were observed after a 14-hour incubation (65 \u00b1 9%; Fig 7B). 28S rRNA levels were reduced to 81 \u00b1 4% compared to control cells; however, this effect was not statistically significant (Fig 7B). Quantification of 5S rRNA, a POLR3 transcript, revealed a statistically significant decrease even for this rRNA species after 14 hours of CHX treatment (46 \u00b1 11%; Fig 7C). These data demonstrated that during translation inhibition induced by CHX, the quantity of rRNA transcripts of both RNA polymerases (POLR1 and POLR3) were decreased. In comparison to the general rRNA synthesis shut-down resulting from the action of CHX, TBEV infection induced only a decrease in POLR1 rRNA transcripts (Fig 7D). This suggests that TBEV infection specifically targeted POLR1, which may subsequently result in translational shut-off.",

Surprisingly, the effect of translational arrest was so robust that even the protein levels of two commonly used housekeeping genes, GAPDH and HPRT1, were significantly lowered (Fig 3A and 3B). Cell lines of both neural and non-neural origin underwent translational shut-off, demonstrating thus the general nature of this phenomenon upon TBEV infection. However, the rate of reduction varied substantially in individual cell lines suggesting cell-dependent effects. TBEV Hypr strain caused a greater translational shut-off in all cell lines compared to the Neudoerfl strain. This may be due to the increased virulence and neuroinvasiveness of the Hypr strain [53] or due to susceptibility and tropism of the virus strains to specific cell types. Recent studies have demonstrated that some flaviviruses can cause translation suppression via diverse mechanisms [24, 48]. These findings together with our results revise the idea of flaviviruses as \u201cnon-host cell protein synthesis influencers\u201d [25, 54, 55]. Indeed, flaviviruses have been thought to avoid the host-cell protein synthesis shut-off as they replicate at a slower rate and global protein synthesis manipulation might have potentially deleterious effects on cell viability and virus yields [56, 57]. However, reduced synthesis of host proteins had no adverse effect on the production of viral NS3 and C proteins (Fig 1C), viral gRNA (Fig 1B) or production of viral progeny (Fig 1A). This suggests that protein synthesis shut-off does not stop TBEV from successful replication.",

Thereby it is anticipated to see an increase in viperin mRNA levels upon TBEV infection in DAOY cells. However, the absence of endogenous viperin protein in TBEV-infected cells is surprising. Thus, translational shut-off may yield multiple advantages to TBEV. Apart from gearing the host protein synthesis apparatus to the purposes of the virus, it may also perform as an immune evasion strategy by preventing ISG production. A widely used stable overexpression approach in an ISG/viperin study [59] might therefore mask the real interactions among flaviviruses and host cells during the infection.

Only scarce information is available regarding the virus-induced reduction of rRNA expression, production, and maturation. For example, murine hepatitis virus directly reduces the levels of mature 28S rRNA [62]; Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus was shown to decrease both, 18S and 28S rRNAs [63]. Additionally, over-expression of HIV Tat protein in Drosophila melanogaster led to the impairment of 45S pre-rRNA precursor processing [35]. Similarly, herpes simplex virus 1 decreased the rate of rRNA maturation despite unaltered levels of 45-47S pre-rRNA and unchanged POLR1 activity [32]. The reduction of rRNA levels can be associated with the induction of nucleolar stress, which is characterized by several hallmarks including nucleolar and ribosomal disruption eventually leading to the activation of the p53 signalling pathway. A possible link between flaviviral pathogenesis and nucleolar stress was suggested previously. DENV and ZIKV, but not WNV were shown to induce nucleolar stress in infected cells by disruption of nucleoli, which resulted in an increased rate of apoptosis via the p53 signalling cascade [64]. However, no disruption of nucleoli was observed in the case of TBEV-infected DAOY cells (S5B Fig), possibly not surprising as the TBEV infection specifically affects only the POLR1 activity.",

Translational shut-off can otherwise be elicited by host cell defence mechanisms, such as activation of protein kinase R (PKR) or PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) [65\u201367]. To elucidate the exact mechanism of the inhibition of host protein and rRNA production and actual involvement of viral and host factors further experiments will be needed. These may for example assess whether viral proteins can directly inhibit transcription and/or translation. The present study does not elucidate this question and more work will be required to understand the processes; underlying the effects described here.",

In contrast, TBEV infection only affected the 45-47S pre-rRNA precursor (and mature 18S and 28S rRNA levels) and did not affect 5S rRNA. This suggests TBEV-specific inhibition of POLR1 activity, which could result in reduced production of host proteins. Further analyses are needed to characterise the connection between rRNA production arrests and translational shut-off upon TBEV infection.",
