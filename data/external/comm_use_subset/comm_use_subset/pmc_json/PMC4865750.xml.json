To test sequence coverage of the targeted genetic variants, we assessed strains with mutations known to confer resistance to ciprofloxacin4. Because WGA may incorporate bias22, these experiments used non-amplified whole genome extracted DNA to more accurately determine the assay LOD. Linear regression was utilized to fit data to a line and determine the point at which each genetic variant had 30X read coverage above the cutoff as determined by non-template controls24 (Fig. 4). This crossing point was determined to be the assay LOD. An LOD range was given for each genetic variant based on the standard error of the linear regression. In this context, each genetic variant fell within ranges of detection between 300 and 1200 input genome copies similar to the cutoff levels determined earlier. As demonstrated previously, the percentage of correctly assigned reads was between 80\u2013100% at concentrations near or above the LOD (Fig. 4).",

In cases of limited sample volume and a large number of potential targets, real-time PCR or HRM real-time PCR screening is not feasible. A multiplexed upfront amplification strategy could be used to amplify targets of interest allowing for screening with these low cost, quick time-to-answer singleplex assays. To test MIPs applicability as a target amplification technique for other molecular assays, we assessed HRM assays targeting ciprofloxacin resistant genetic variants with amplicons generated by the MIP protocol. Detection of two gyrA mutations and a parE deletion in F. tularensis4 using the MIP protocol as an upfront target enrichment demonstrated differences between wild-type and ciprofloxacin resistant strains (Fig. 7a,b). Melting peaks with the gyrA C248T G259T mutation had an overall decrease in melting temperature, and the parE \u0394TTAAA mutation had an increase in melting temp due to the increase in GC content. Furthermore, the use of MIPs significantly amplified target sequences based on Cq values for HRM experiments performed with purified genomic DNA versus amplified MIP DNA (Fig. 7c,d). Specifically, MIPs significantly reduced detection above background for the HRM analysis even after a 1:10,000 dilution of the MIP amplified material was required for the assays to fall within the optimal Cq range (Fig. 6c,d). Overall, cumulative datasets with these MIPs suggest this technique is a highly multiplexable capture system that can be utilized with multiple molecular detection assays for genetic variant identification.",

Real-time PCR is advantageous to other molecular diagnostics in many aspects including cost, time to answer, and sensitivity. One major aspect for time to answer is assay sensitivity and the ability to detect pathogen directly from patient samples without the necessity of culture. Bacteremia in septic patients can range more than 10-fold although<1000 colony forming units/ml of blood is common3132. Real-time PCR offers sensitivities approaching one target copy per reaction282933 allowing sample processing and detection directly from patient samples. NGS capabilities have outpaced Moore\u2019s law boasting continuous technical improvements over the past decade however, relative to real-time PCR, diagnostic sensitivities are still lacking9. Metagenomic sequencing from clinical samples requires ultra-deep sequencing to obtain desired coverage levels of targeted pathogen and is not practical for routine clinical use due to cost and informatics burden. Targeted sequencing helps to bridge the gap between the sensitivities seen with real-time PCR and the quantitative data associated with NGS.",

Mock clinical samples required an approximate 10-fold greater number of genome copies for positive detection above background levels. This difference is likely attributed to the carryover of inhibitors from complex matrices and variable efficiencies of sample processing methods which are known to affect PCR LODs9343536. Other factors affecting LOD include poor signal to noise and misidentification of pooled samples. Specifically, excess MIP backbone within each sample resulted in higher noise at low sample input concentrations (Supplemental Figure S1). De novo assembly of the un-mapped reads showed residual MIP backbone present after the cleanup. This was due to the formation of concatemers during the amplification process. The resulting background was more problematic as input concentrations approached the background cutoff. Similarly, incorrect assignment of dual indexed samples or sample bleeding2223 was more pronounced at lower input concentrations. At these values the percentage of correctly mapped reads dropped below 50% for most capture regions tested. This read misidentification is an inherent limitation with multiplexed NGS which, as technology improves, can be overcome23.",

Metagenomic sequencing could both classify the organism along with known resistance markers; however, the expertise and computing infrastructure required for analyzing data is still burdensome for clinical and biosurveillance programs. Metagenomic sequencing is not conducive for pooled sample NGS runs due to the difficulty obtaining adequate sequence coverage for genetic variants in complex matrices, increasing per sample costs. Depending on the NGS instrument, ultra-deep sequencing requires runs times ranging from days to over a week depending on desired coverage937. Targeted sequencing allows for significant coverage of desired regions over background genome and simple reference based mapping9. This permits sample pooling resulting in significant cost reduction with sequencing results in hours depending on desired amplicon length38. The cost burden of MIPs as an upfront amplification technology is marginal and increases NGS library preparation time by approximately 5\u20136 hours which is only slightly longer than multiplexed PCR based amplification technologies.",

Techniques such as high level multiplex PCR often have reduced specificity when highly multiplexed due to non-specific amplification resulting from interactions in primer pairs45. Target circularization techniques such as MIPs have increased specificity attributed to 1) dual enzymatic events required for gap fill and ligation, 2) exonuclease digestion of non-circularized material, and 3) a common backbone which physically restricts the two homologous binding arms45. Sequencing data shown here demonstrated the ciprofloxacin MIP assay captured targeted regions of interest within the organism specifically and reproducibly at a high degree of multiplex. In fact, Pearson coefficients for intra-organism multiplex capture of targeted regions in B. anthracis and F. tularensis showed a high degree of correlation (Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, correlation analysis of inter-organism probes from all six capture regions was highly related and reproducible among experiments. This high degree of correlation suggests that the multiplexed probeset reproducibly captured regions of interest with similar efficiencies across a broad range of input DNA.",
