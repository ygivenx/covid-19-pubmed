            "text": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification of eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Despite the identification of this modification over four decades ago, only recently have major breakthroughs in our understanding of this modification been made due to the development of m6A-seq, which allows immunoprecipitation of fragmented m6A-modified RNAs followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. m6A-seq and subsequent enhanced versions of the technique led to transcriptome-wide maps of cellular m6A modification (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012; Patil et al., 2016). m6A writers have also been identified, a catalytically active methyl-transferase, METTL3 (Wang et al., 2016), together with adapter components, catalyses m6A addition onto specific RNA sequences containing the DRm6ACH motif, where D = A, G or U; R = A or G; H = A, C or U. The RNA demethylases FTO (Jia et al., 2011) and ALKBH5 (Zheng et al., 2013) can erase m6A marks offering a dynamic regulation of m6A status in RNA. Importantly, a family of effector m6A readers have also been identified comprising five YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing proteins. YTH readers directly bind m6A in target RNAs through an aromatic cage (Liao et al., 2018), directing their targets towards different biological fates. YTHDF2 recruits the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and promotes degradation of m6A-containing RNAs (Du et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2014) while YTHDF1, YTHDF3 and YTHDC2 stimulate mRNA translation of their targets (Wang et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017; Hsu et al., 2017) and YTHDC1 regulates mRNA splicing (Xiao et al., 2016). Whether other proteins can directly recognise m6A has remained a question to date. Other RNA-binding proteins can read m6A indirectly, in a so-called \u2018m6A switch\u2019 mechanism, in which m6A destabilises the local RNA structure in hairpins allowing recruitment of either hnRNPC to U-tracts (Liu et al., 2015) or hnRNPG to a purine-rich motif (Liu et al., 2017), both readers then regulate alternative splicing. Recently, IGF2BP proteins were reported to enhance mRNA stability and translation of m6A-containing RNAs and proposed to be a novel class of m6A readers (Huang et al., 2018).",

KSHV has a biphasic life cycle, with a latent phase and a productive lytic phase. During latency, the KSHV episome is dormant in the nucleus of endothelial progenitor cells and B-lymphocytes (Giffin and Damania, 2014), with few viral latent genes expressed. Under various stimuli, the KSHV episome can be reactivated into lytic replication, leading to the ordered expression of more than 80 viral proteins. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) viral protein, which is encoded from open reading frame 50 (ORF50), is the first lytic protein produced and is essential for the latent-lytic switch (Guito and Lukac, 2012).",

Through the use of RNA affinity, in addition to YTH readers, eight members from the Tudor domain \u2018Royal family\u2019, including SND1 (Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing protein 1), were specifically enriched in m6A-modified KSHV sequences. The \u2018Royal family\u2019 is a well-characterised family that reads methylated residues in histones through the use of an aromatic cage (Chen et al., 2011) which is structurally similar to the one found in YTH readers (Luo and Tong, 2014). Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrate the ability of specific Royal domains to selectively bind m6A-modified RNA. As these domains do not bind all m6A-modified RNA sequences it suggests this binding may occur in a RNA secondary structure/sequence-dependent manner. We further developed a modified RIP-seq technique, which significantly improves the resolution of standard RIP, accompanied by a unique bioinformatic analysis to characterise for the first time the transcriptome-wide binding profile of SND1 to cellular and KSHV mRNAs, revealing SND1 as a bona fide RNA-binding protein that targets m6A-modified RNAs in KSHV-infected cells, including the extensively m6A-modified ORF50 RNA. SND1 eCLIP (enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation) analysis using publically available datasets deposited in the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) further confirmed that SND1 has a binding profile similar to other m6A reader proteins. Importantly, depletion of SND1 in KSHV-infected cells significantly reduced the stability of unspliced ORF50 RNA and led to markedly reduced levels of RTA protein together with a global impairment of KSHV lytic replication. Furthermore, we show that m6A-modification in ORF50 RNA regulates SND1 binding to this RNA, particularly to the unspliced form. These data identify SND1 as an essential m6A reader for KSHV lytic replication and implicate the \u2018Royal family\u2019 as a family which comprises m6A readers. This, considerably expands the landscape of m6A readers and the epigenetic functions of Royal members beyond protein methylation.",

            "text": "We have previously developed dedicated software (m6aViewer) which implements a novel m6A peak-calling algorithm that identifies high-confidence methylated residues with more precision than previously described approaches (Antanaviciute et al., 2017). Utilising this software we mapped m6A modifications in the KSHV transcriptome by performing m6A-seq in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, a BCBL1-based, primary effusion lymphoma B-cell line containing latent KSHV episomes capable of doxycycline-inducible reactivation of lytic replication. We carried out m6A-seq in latent cells and cells undergoing lytic replication for 8 hr and 20 hr post-induction in two biological replicates. In latent cells, we consistently observed m6A peaks in six viral RNAs, including ORF72 and ORF73. At 8 hr post-reactivation, 33 m6A peaks were identified in 21 KSHV ORFs in both biological replicates (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a). At 20 hr post-reactivation, 75 m6A peaks were mapped in 42 KSHV ORFs (Figure 1a). The positions of these m6A peaks were highly reproducible across the different time points and replicates (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b). 12 viral m6A peaks were further validated by two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2). m6A peaks in cellular RNAs were also consistently called, with 18,946 m6A peaks common to both replicates in latent cells and 18,935 and 13,926 m6A peaks in cells reactivated for 8 hr and 20 hr, respectively (Figure 1b, Supplementary file 4). Cellular m6A peaks remained mostly unchanged between latent and 8 hr of lytic replication. Lower detection of m6A peaks at 20 hr post-reactivation was observed in part due to KSHV-mediated host cell shut-off (Conrad, 2009) (Figure 1c). However, the majority of uniquely identified m6A peaks at this time point were found in RNAs whose expression was increased during lytic replication (Figure 1c). Cellular m6A peaks were enriched in the coding region (CDS) and 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) throughout KSHV infection (Figure 1d). In viral mRNAs, the majority of m6A peaks were located in the CDS (Figure 1e). We also confirmed the DRm6ACH motif both in cellular and viral mRNAs (Figure 1f and g, respectively). Approximately 60% of viral m6A peaks contained the GGm6AC[G/U] motif, a significant over-representation of the motif when compared to the expected DRm6ACH frequency.",

All raw sequencing data were subjected to quality control and processing as described in methods and m6A peaks were identified with m6aViewer. Peaks were filtered to keep only those with a minimum of 20 mean reads, 1% FDR (benjamini-hochberg) and an enrichment of 4-fold m6A-IP/input. After applying these cut-offs, our TREx BCBL1-Rta cells datasets contained twice as many m6A peaks as compared to the Tan dataset in the same cell line. ~17,000 and~10,000 cellular m6A peaks were identified in our dataset during latency and lytic replication, respectively, while the Tan dataset yielded ~9,000 m6A peaks during latency and ~4,500 m6A peaks during lytic replication (Figure 2a). The most cellular m6A peaks were identified in the Hesser datasets in iSLK cells with ~25,000 m6A peaks. A direct one-to-one reciprocal overlap comparison between each of our m6A peaks and those found in the other datasets was not possible, mostly due to vastly different peak widths (with the other datasets having narrower peaks and containing short read length coupled to single end data). In such situations, many peaks cannot be mapped one-to-one, with multiple peaks often overlapping a single one when comparing datasets, which leads to overlap quantifications that are not easily interpretable. Therefore, we compared the overlap of m6A-modified transcripts identified between all three studies. In TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, 72% of our 5,830 m6A-modified transcripts in latent cells were also present in the same cell line during latency in the Tan dataset, while 52% of our 4,059 m6A-modified transcripts in lytic cells were common to the lytic Tan dataset (Figure 2b).~80% of m6A-modified transcripts in our TREx BCBL1-Rta dataset were also identified in the Hesser dataset which mapped m6A in iSLK cells (Figure 2b). This analysis shows a high reproducibility identifying m6A-modified transcripts in KSHV-infected cell lines by three different groups.",

We then compared the m6A-IP coverage maps of the KSHV transcriptome in lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines, overall, viral m6A peaks were strikingly similar in both studies (Figure 2c). Of note, m6A peaks in ORF50 RNA were consistently mapped in similar regions in both iSLK and TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1), with the highest similarity found between TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines. Although, in particular instances, m6A peaks differed between studies, for example ORF56 and ORF64 had a distinct m6A peak in this study but not in Tan et al. (Figure 2c and d, purple boxes), while K12 was m6A-modified in Tan et al. but not in our study (Figure 2c and d, green box). Intriguingly, when we compared the m6A-IP coverage maps between our lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and lytic iSLK cells from Tan et al., although clear common peaks were present, these maps differed more than the TREx BCBL1-Rta cells (Figure 2c and d, blue lines) suggesting that the KSHV transcriptome may be differentially modified depending on the cell type, suggesting potential epitranscriptomic remodelling of silencing and activating m6A motifs may take place differently between cell types (Hesser et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018).",

            "text": "We were intrigued to determine whether any m6A readers uniquely interact with methylated viral mRNAs. Of particular interest were the m6A peaks found in the second exon of ORF50 RNA, as this RNA encodes the latent to lytic switch RTA protein. To this end, RNA affinity coupled to mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Viral RNA baits were centred on the closest GGACU motif to the m6A peak positions of the largest peak of ORF37 and the first and fourth m6A peaks of the second exon of ORF50 (Figure 1h) (hereafter referred to as ORF37, ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 baits respectively). See Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1 for m6A peak positions from all m6A-seq time points. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three m6A baits enriched for YTH readers (Figure 3a). An intriguing observation was that of the three viral baits, exclusively the methylated ORF50-1 (m6A-ORF50-1) distinctly enriched SND1, a Tudor domain-containing protein. SND1 was in the top thirteen enriched protein hits, together with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3. Further binding validation of YTHDF1 and SND1 in RNA affinity experiments demonstrated that YTHDF1 was greatly enriched in all three methylated baits while SND1 showed a modest but clear enrichment exclusively in m6A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). SND1 binds symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMA) via its Tudor domain (Liu et al., 2010), thus it harbours the ability to selectively recognise methyl groups. In addition to SND1, m6A-ORF50-1 bait also prominently pulled down three spliceosomal proteins known to interact with the Tudor domain of SND1, snRNP200, snRNP116 and PRPF8 (Yang et al., 2007). These proteins were within the top fifteen enriched protein hits. Multiple proteins related to RNA processing were also enriched in this bait (Supplementary file 1). SND1 belongs to the Tudor domain \u2018Royal family\u2019, comprising five subfamilies: Tudor, plant agenet, chromo, PWWP and MBT (Maurer-Stroh et al., 2003). Members from each subfamily share a structurally related \u03b2-barrel that harbours an aromatic cage implicated in binding methylated arginines and lysines (Chen et al., 2011). Intriguingly, the aromatic cage used for m6A recognition by YTH readers is structurally similar to the one present in the \u2018Royal family\u2019 (Luo and Tong, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2014). Thus, further scrutiny for Royal members was carried out in the mass spectrometry data. Strikingly, several Royal members were also enriched in methylated viral baits. All three plant agenet members, which were recently identified as RNA sequence-dependent m6A readers (Edupuganti et al., 2017; Arguello et al., 2017), were exclusively bound to m6A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3a). Three PWWP domain-containing proteins were also enriched in m6A-ORF50-1 bait while m6A-ORF37 bait retrieved the chromo protein CBX3 (Figure 3a). These results suggest that Royal domains may be capable of reading methyl-decorations not only in proteins but also in RNA. None of the indirect m6A readers, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPC or hnRNPG, or IGF2BP proteins were enriched in any of the baits (Supplementary file 2). Eight proteins with methyl-transferase activity were also recruited to methylated baits (Supplementary file 2), of these, METTL16 is the second m6A methyltransferase identified to date (Pendleton et al., 2017), which methylates structured RNAs where the adenosine is present in a bulge in the nonamer sequence UACAGAGAA, where A is modified (Mendel et al., 2018). The remaining identified proteins may play a previously uncharacterised role in the m6A RNA metabolism. Taken together, these results identify several members from the \u2018Royal family\u2019 as putative m6A readers.",

            "text": "We next determined whether the Royal domains from the Royal members enriched in methylated viral RNAs display affinity for m6A-modified RNA in the absence of any other protein interaction. The complete Royal Tudor domain of SND1 (residues 650\u2013910) is required for sDMA-binding (Liu et al., 2010), consequently, a GST-recombinant protein containing these residues (548-910), referred here as SND1-C-terminus, was used in native electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). Notably, SND1-C-terminus shifted m6A-ORF50-1 bait in contrast to the control bait (Figure 3b). Neither ORF50-4 nor ORF37 methylated baits were selectively bound by SND1-C-terminus (Figure 3c and d, respectively). Note that the membranes had to be overexposed to obtain a good shift signal due to the small amount of shifted RNA in comparison with the free bait, consistent with the modest enrichment of SND1 in m6A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2). Similarly, a weak shift has also been previously observed in EMSAs for FMRP protein (Edens et al., 2019) and IGF2BP proteins (Huang et al., 2018). RNA secondary structure prediction of all baits indicates that they form strongly base-paired hairpins with an apical loop in which m6A is exposed and an additional large unpaired bulge; however, ORF50-4 and ORF37 feature this unpaired bulge in the middle of their stem (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3). This may imply that SND1 cannot bind when the unpaired bulge is present at this position irrespective of m6A. In contrast, the beginning of the stem of ORF50-1 shows weak base-pairing with four unpaired bases (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3, black box) that may allow opening of the hairpin and selective SND1-binding when m6A is present. Curiously, when running m6A-ORF50-1 bait on its own (without any protein), two distinct bands were visualised, one lower band which migrated at the same speed of A-ORF50-1 bait and another higher band migrating slower (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4). Electrospray ionisation (ESI) of the ORF50-1 baits showed that there were no truncated forms and that the correct molecular weight of a methyl group had been added (15 daltons), demonstrating the purity of the baits (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4). As m6A can destabilise local RNA structure in hairpins (Liu et al., 2015), it seems plausible that m6A addition to ORF50-1 destabilises the hairpin which then migrates slower compared with the non-methylated bait. To test this hypothesis, a cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) with strong base-pairing throughout the stem (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3) was tested in EMSAs. Remarkably, SND1-C-terminus did not shift this bait (Figure 3e), highlighting that structural features of the RNA ligand are critical for SND1-binding and that the beginning of the m6A-ORF50-1 hairpin (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3, boxed region) may be required for an interaction with SND1. We further mutated seven nucleotides to make this region very structured and stable, as demonstrated by the increase in free energy of this stable hairpin (sORF50-1). No specific selectivity for m6A-sORF50-1 by SND1-C-terminus was seen (Figure 3f), indicating that destabilisation of this region is required for SND1 binding. Shorter exposure of the free m6A-sORF50-1 bait did not reveal two distinct bands as the ones present in m6A-ORF50-1 hairpin (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4). To further support the hypothesis that Royal domains harbour selectivity for m6A-modified RNA, GST-recombinant proteins containing the Royal domains of FXR1, PSIP1 and CBX3 were tested in EMSAs. Coomassie staining for all recombinant proteins can be seen in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5. The Royal domains of FXR1 and PSIP1 selectively shifted m6A-ORF50-1 bait, in contrast, none of the other baits were bound (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6a and b, respectively). The CBX3 chromodomain displayed a very faint shift for m6A-ORF50-1 bait, however this shift was not consistent between protein preparations (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7a) indicating that this domain either may not be able to read m6A, or other protein partners could be required for its interaction with m6A in vivo. Control glutathione S-transferase (GST), a protein with no RNA-binding properties, was also tested in EMSA showing no selectivity for m6A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7b). EMSAs were also performed in the presence of excess herring sperm DNA as a source of non-specific DNA. In the presence of sperm DNA no shift was detected and the free bait remained uncomplexed (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7c), suggesting that non-specific DNA prevents the interaction between SND1 and m6A-ORF50-1 bait. This is not surprising as excess of DNA may sequester SND1 which is a known DNA-binding transcription factor. Together, these results confirm that Royal domains in the absence of any other protein interaction display selectivity for m6A-modified RNA, our data also suggests that this selectivity may occur in a RNA secondary structure-dependent manner.",

            "text": "Next, we aimed to characterise the RNA-binding sites of endogenous SND1 transcriptome-wide during KSHV infection by performing RIP-seq in two biological replicates. Latent and lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated for either 8 or 20 hr were used. We aimed to obtain the best protein binding site resolution by sonicating the majority of the total RNA to <200 bp (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a and b). Unexpectedly, after construction of the cDNA library from the SND1-RNA immunoprecipitated (RIP) samples, the majority of the fragments ranged from 150 to 1000 bp (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1c). Thus, this technique has a binding site resolution of ~1 kB. A transcript-wide analysis enabled us to identify SND1 RNA targets, using a false discovery rate (FDR) < 1% and a fold change of RIP reads over input reads >2, this analysis uncovered SND1 as a bona fide RNA-binding protein, yielding 5061 target transcripts (Supplementary file 5). Of these, 3319 transcripts were mRNAs and 748 were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). These target RNAs were consistently bound by SND1 during latency and lytic KSHV replication (both at 8 and 20 hr). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these transcripts code for proteins that are involved in regulating GTPase activity, nervous system development and cell morphogenesis (Figure 4a). Next, all highly expressed transcripts identified by RIP-seq (FDR < 1%) were divided into high-confidence targets (those which had at least twice the normalised coverage in RIPs than input) and high-confidence non-targets (those which had at least twice as much coverage in inputs than RIPs) and the proportion of m6A-bearing RNAs in each group was determined. Strikingly, we observed that ~50% of high-confidence targets and ~24% of high-confidence non-targets were m6A-modified RNAs (Figure 4b), representing a marked enrichment of m6A-bearing RNAs in the target group. It is worth noting that this transcript-wide analysis will not identify all SND1 targets, as when looking at the SND1-binding profile at the transcript level, it was evident that some RNAs are bound by SND1 at a specific region only (Figure 4c).",

These results are not unexpected as they are in agreement with the finding that SND1 does not bind m6A indiscriminately. We then mined previously processed PAR-CLIP and m6A-seq data sets (Wang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2017) from HeLa cells and calculated the percentage of total RNA targets of YTH readers that contain m6A-modified transcripts. ~ 65% of all RNA targets contained m6A-modified transcripts (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2). In addition, we compared the overlap of target genes containing or lacking m6A modification between SND1 and each heterologously expressed YTH reader. To our surprise, despite comparing TREx BCBL1-Rta and HeLa cells, we found that ~50%,~32% and~37% of SND1 m6A-modified targets are common to YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, respectively (Figure 4e). When we compared the SND1 targets that lack m6A, only ~4%, ~1% and ~3% were shared with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3, respectively (Figure 4f). These results show that SND1 does not merely co-precipitate with YTH readers and that it has a distinct RNA-binding profile.",

            "text": "To identify SND1 RNA targets that could be missed by transcript-wide analysis, a novel localised enrichment analysis was developed similar to that used in ChIP-seq analysis (see Materials and methods). In brief, both spliced transcripts and introns were segmented into a total of ~750,000 transcriptomic regions based on changes in their fold change RIP/input (Figure 4g). Applying a fold change >2 and >50 mean reads per region (FDR < 1%), 32,314 transcriptomic regions were significantly bound by SND1. These regions encompassed 12,915 Ensembl transcripts and after applying a cut-off of >2 fold m6A-IP/input enrichment and a minimum RIP read depth of 50,~40% of these transcripts were m6A-modified. 4872 of these total targets showed SND1-binding throughout 5\u2019UTR, CDS and 3\u2019UTR (Figure 4h). We then focused on analysing SND1-enriched intronic regions, as introns tend to be longer than spliced RNAs and RIP-seq has a low resolution, we hypothesised that if SND1 is an m6A reader we might observe m6A peaks overlapping with SND1-enriched regions in introns. Out of the total 32,314 SND1-enriched regions, 2563 regions were found in introns. Of the latter, 516 intronic regions (20%), directly overlapped with m6A peaks (Figure 5a and e). As a control for random overlap, 8,328 SND1-unbound intronic regions were used, these were defined using a fold change RIP/input < 0.5 and >50 mean reads per region (FDR < 1%). Of these, only ~1.3% (109) directly overlapped with m6A peaks (Figure 4e). SND1-enriched regions overlapping m6A peaks in UTRs (Figure 5b) and lncRNAs (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3a) were also observed. In 5\u2019UTRs and 3\u2019UTRs we found ~40% overlap with m6A peaks in SND1-enriched regions compared to only ~20% overlap of SND1-unbound regions (Figure 5e).",

In contrast, at 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation, several adenosines in this intron are m6A-modified and SND1 binding ensues (Figure 5c). The reverse scenario was also observed for example in the overlapping DUSP5P1-RHOU transcripts, in which specific m6A peaks and SND1-enriched regions present at 0 hr and 8 hr post-reactivation disappeared at 20 hr of lytic reactivation (Figure 5d). A list of these differential SND1-binding events to target RNAs can be accessed in Supplementary file 6.

Since the eCLIP datasets were derived from HepG2 cells, we firstly assessed the overlap between the m6A profile in latent TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and HepG2 cells using an existing m6A-seq dataset from HepG2 cells (Huang et al., 2018) (Figure 6a). This revealed an extensive overlap of transcripts which contain m6A sites in these two cells lines, with 77% of TREx BCBL1-Rta m6A-modified transcripts being present in HepG2 cells. We then investigated the overlap between transcripts which are m6A-modified and bound by SND1 from RIP-seq and eCLIP datasets (Figure 6b). This showed an overlap of 1166 transcripts bound by SND1 of which 88% contained m6A sites. We next compared the extent of overlap between m6A and eCLIP peaks on transcripts (Figure 6c). We found comparable binding site overlap for SND1 and established readers with m6A peaks, whereas a control protein (TIAL1) showed reduced overlap between m6A peaks and its binding sites. We investigated the repertoire of transcripts bound by SND1 and other reader proteins and found extensive binding to protein coding transcripts (Figure 6d). SND1 showed a similar distribution to m6A across transcripts with a bias towards coding region binding in common with most other reader proteins, whereas the control TIAL1 protein displayed a strong 3\u2019 UTR bias (Figure 6e). We used HOMER to identify motifs bound by SND1 and other established reader proteins using the ENCODE eCLIP datasets. This analysis, using peaks called from all transcripts, revealed a common sequence GGAC, the core of the consensus motif surrounding m6A sites. For SND1, this motif is further enriched from the eight highest scoring motif, when performed on all eCLIP peaks (30,121 peaks), to the second highest scoring motif, upon restricting the analysis to SND1 binding sites on exons which contain the m6A modification (7965 peaks), of which 58% (4,637) directly overlap an m6A site (Figure 6f). Together, this analysis reveals that SND1 recognises the consensus m6A motif in vivo and has a similar binding profile to other established reader proteins.",

As a comparison, a highly expressed viral lytic RNA, ORF57, did not reach the cut-off to be considered a high-confidence target (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3e). We additionally identified 33, 23 and 14 KSHV transcripts as high-confidence SND1 targets at 0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation, respectively (Figure 7a). Deep-sequencing coverage for high-confidence SND1 targets can be seen in Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2. Validation of SND1-binding to the different regions containing m6A peaks in the second exon and the intron of ORF50 RNA was performed by RIP followed by RT-qPCR. A ~ 40 fold SND1 enrichment was detected in the second exon of ORF50 and a ~ 10 fold enrichment in the intron compared with the SND1 enrichment detected on the non-target 18S rRNA (Figure 7b). We further tested by RIP the binding of endogenous FXR1, FXR2, PSIP1, YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 to ORF50 RNA, while non-specific rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG) was used as negative control antibody. The YTHDF1 RNA target SON (Wang et al., 2014) was used as a binding control RNA for YTH readers. Both YTH readers and FXR2 bound ORF50 RNA, showing a ~ 8 fold enrichment (Figure 7b) and ~15 fold enrichment was observed for FXR1. PSIP1 showed a limited but consistent enrichment (~3 fold) above the negative control IgG. These results highlight that all these Royal members can target ORF50 RNA, SND1 displaying the highest affinity.",

Here, two TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines with stable shRNA knockdown of SND1 (SND1 KD1 and SND1 KD2) and a shRNA scramble cell line were generated. Surprisingly, following 24 hr of lytic replication there were no significant differences between the scramble and the knockdown cell lines in the amount of KSHV lytic transcripts produced (Figure 7c). In accordance with mRNA levels, RTA and ORF57 proteins were not reduced (Figure 7d). Similarly, the early lytic protein ORF54 was not decreased (Figure 7d). These data were also confirmed by RNA-seq performed in scramble and SND1 KD2 cells from two biological replicates. Following 24 hr of lytic reactivation, expression of the KSHV transcriptome in SND1-depleted cells was not significantly altered from scramble cells, with the exception of upregulation of ORF71 and ORF72 mRNAs (Figure 7e). qRT-PCR analysis confirmed a ~ 4 fold-induction of these transcripts in SND1-depleted cells during the lytic cycle (data not shown). These results possibly suggest that SND1 plays a role in maintaining low expression of these latent RNAs during lytic replication. Importantly, in the presence of overexpressed RTA protein, KSHV lytic replication is essentially unchanged in SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, thus these cells still fulfil all viral functions necessary for triggering the lytic cascade.",

In contrast, the parental BCBL1 cell line lacks Myc-tagged RTA and reactivation is achieved by addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB), which leads to the expression of unspliced ORF50 RNA. This native RNA matures to the spliced form giving rise to RTA protein, which then transactivates the ORF50 promoter in a positive transcriptional feedback mechanism (Guito and Lukac, 2012). However, as SND1 does not take part in the splicing of ORF50 RNA (Figure 7c), it therefore suggests a potential role in the stabilisation of ORF50 RNA, which could be masked by constitutive overexpression of Myc-tagged RTA in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. Thus, the same lentiviral shRNAs targeting SND1 were used to knockdown SND1 in BCBL1 cells. Remarkably, both SND1 knockdown cell lines showed a dramatic decrease in viral RNAs, including ORF50 RNA (Figure 7f), and RTA, ORF57 and ORF54 protein levels (Figure 7g). These data were also confirmed by RNA-seq performed in scramble and SND1 KD2 BCBL1 cells from two biological replicates. After 24 hr of lytic reactivation, 48 KSHV RNAs were significantly downregulated in SND1-depleted cells compared with scramble cells (FDR < 5%), including ORF50 RNA (Figure 7h). These results indicate that in the absence of SND1 there is a global impairment of lytic KSHV replication downstream of RTA and uncover SND1 as an essential protein for lytic KSHV replication.",

Strikingly, native ORF50 RNA was significantly more unstable in SND1-depleted cells (Figure 8b) with ~80% of ORF50 RNA remaining at 6 hr post-transcription inhibition in scramble cells and ~50% in depleted cells. To further determine whether SND1 may also play a role in regulating the stability of ORF71 and ORF72 RNAs during the KSHV lytic cycle, the turnover of these transcripts together with other high confidence SND1 KSHV RNA targets was also investigated.

Firstly, single-point mutations were performed in the GGACU motifs present in ORF50 baits to elucidate whether the chosen motifs were m6A-modified in the context of the full length ORF50 RNA. Wild type (WT) FLAG-ORF50 -containing both ORF50 exons and the intron- and mutant plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells and m6A enrichment quantified by m6A-IP-qPCR (Figure 8c). In transfected cells, ORF50 RNA was particularly m6A-modified in ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 regions, suggesting cell type differences between TREx BCBL1-Rta and HEK-293 cells. Point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait, but not in ORF50-4 bait, significantly reduced m6A enrichment, confirming that this site is m6A-modified. Next, the binding of SND1 to WT FLAG-ORF50 and to a FLAG-ORF50 plasmid with a point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait was evaluated by RIP. No significant decrease in SND1 binding was observed (Figure 8d), indicating that other SND1 binding sites are necessary for ORF50 RNA-SND1 interaction.",

HEK-293 cells were transfected with WT FLAG-ORF50 plasmid and 4 hr after transfection, control 0.25% (v/v) DMSO or 200 \u00b5M DAA was incubated for an additional 24 hr. Note that DAA did not result in cytotoxicity at this concentration after 26 hr post-treatment (Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1). DAA effectively reduced m6A enrichment in all m6A-modified regions of ORF50 RNA (Figure 8c) and led to a significant decrease of SND1 binding across ORF50 RNA (Figure 8d). Interestingly, DAA completely abolished SND1 binding to the native ORF50 transcript, indicating that m6A inhibition on ORF50 RNA regulates SND1 binding to it, however the exact points of interaction between SND1 and ORF50 RNA remain to be elucidated at single nucleotide resolution.",

            "text": "SND1 is a multi-functional protein. It functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2, STAT5, STAT6 and c-Myb (Jariwala et al., 2015). Additionally, SND1 has multiple roles modulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. SND1 is a component of the RISC complex (Jariwala et al., 2015) and acts in the processing of specific miRNAs (Heinrich et al., 2013). m6A promotes processing of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) (Alarc\u00f3n et al., 2015), thus SND1 may also process m6A-modified pri-miRNAs, which could explain the SND1-binding in methylated introns we observed. In agreement with our finding that SND1 stabilises ORF50 RNA, SND1 binds to the 3\u2032UTR of angiotensin II type one receptor (AT1R) and stabilises this mRNA leading to elevated protein AT1R levels (Jariwala et al., 2015). Intriguingly, AT1R mRNA contains a single m6A site which is located in the 3\u2019UTR region (Sun et al., 2016). Finally, SND1 also participates in RNA editing (Jariwala et al., 2015). Under stress conditions, in mammalian cells SND1 co-localises with G3BP protein in stress granules (Gao et al., 2010) and stabilises AT1R and IGFBP2 mRNAs (Gao et al., 2015). Similarly, in plants SND1 is essential for the stabilisation of a subset of stress-responsive mRNAs (Frei dit Frey et al., 2010). It will be of interest to address to what extent SND1 regulates the stability of its target RNAs. Curiously, the readers YTHDF1-3, FXR1, FXR2 and FMR1 have also been identified in mammalian stress granule cores (Jain et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Differences in the binding affinities for the different RNA baits used in this study between YTH readers and the Royal members can be inferred from previous structural studies. Interestingly, in SND1 (Chen et al., 2009a), plant agenet members (Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010), PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 (Qin and Min, 2014), the aromatic pocket is hydrophobic and surrounded by both positive and negative residues thus, it seems plausible that binding only ensues when matching electrostatic interactions are achieved between the RNA sequence and the Royal domain, consequently, methylated proteins would adopt a different orientation to interact with negatively charged residues while m6A-decorated RNAs would interact with positively charged residues. This model would explain the RNA structure dependency observed for these proteins in binding m6A-modified RNA. In contrast, the aromatic cage of YTH readers resides in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by a positively charged surface, rendering the YTH domain favourable to bind any methylated RNA sequence. Of note, plant agenet members contain two plant agenet domains (Agenet1 and Agenet2) in tandem, each harbouring an aromatic cage. Whilst the aromatic cage of Agenet2 is proposed to be the site that binds methylated lysines (Adams-Cioaba et al., 2010), Agenet1 exhibits a basic surface patch with potential for RNA binding (Myrick et al., 2015). The plant Agenet domain of FMRP (1-134) has already been shown to harbour RNA-binding ability to RNA homopolymers, with progressively increased affinity when testing longer FMRP constructs (1\u2013180 and 1\u2013214), suggesting a cooperative effect between the positively charged residues distributed along the N-terminus region (Milosevich and Hof, 2016). In a similar manner, the other domains present in SND1 cannot be disregarded in considering how SND1 may bind its target RNAs. Our RIP-seq data and eCLIP analysis reveals for the first time that SND1 is indeed a bona fide RNA-binding protein acting at the transcriptome level. Structural and biochemical analysis had already proposed that the N-terminal region of SND1, specifically SN3 and SN4, possess RNA binding (Li et al., 2008), thus, in addition to the Tudor domain interacting with methylated RNA, the N-terminal region of SND1 most likely also contributes to RNA binding and may play a significant role in determining which RNAs are targeted by SND1, including those that are methylated.",

Of the Tudor subfamily, the Tudor domain-containing (TDRD) proteins, AKAP1, SMN and SPF30 display methyl-arginine-binding and are involved in RNA metabolism (Chen et al., 2011), therefore these are ideal candidates to reveal more m6A readers. In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed SND1, most of the mammalian TDRD proteins display male germline-enriched expression and are essential for spermatogenesis (Chen et al., 2011). It will be of interest to examine whether m6A-decorated RNAs are regulated post-transcriptionally via TDRD proteins during germ cell differentiation. Notably, spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding protein (STRBP) was within the top ten enriched proteins in m6A-ORF50-1 bait. The remainder members of the Tudor protein subfamily bind methyl-lysine residues and contain other domains related to chromatin biology, consequently, these proteins are unlikely to participate in RNA metabolism. The discovery of PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 as putative m6A readers is surprising as the PWWP domain is a well-established nucleosome-binding domain and these proteins participate in DNA repair (Qin and Min, 2014). However, FMRP takes part in the DNA damage response (Alpatov et al., 2014) but FMRP is also a RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of its m6A-containing target RNAs (Edupuganti et al., 2017). An m6A RNA-mediated response to UV-induced DNA damage was recently reported (Xiang et al., 2017), as such, these PWWP proteins could represent a link between methylation of RNA and DNA damage. In support of the putative m6A reading ability of these proteins is the fact that mass spectrometry identification of PSIP1 short (p52) isoform, which includes the PWWP domain, revealed that ~95% of interactors function in pre-mRNA processing. Moreover this isoform co-localised with SRSF2 in nuclear speckles and modulated alternative splicing (Pradeepa et al., 2012), thus the implication of these proteins in m6A RNA metabolism requires further investigation.",

At the desired time point a fraction of the cells was removed to serve as input RNA to control for RNA expression and stored in TRIzol (Thermo Scientific) at \u221280\u00b0C. For each RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), 7 \u00d7 106 cells were used. Cells were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde (Calbiochem) for 10 min at room temperature. Crosslinking was stopped by addition of glycine at a final concentration of 125 mM for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS (Lonza) and re-suspended in 200 \u03bcl of ice-cold shearing buffer [50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) NP-40] supplemented with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) and 1 \u00b5l of murine RNase inhibitor (NEB). Samples were then sonicated with an EpiShear multi-sample sonicator (Active Motif) with pulses of 30 s of sonication followed by a 30 s rest for a total of 12 min at 30% amplitude. Polystyrene sonication tubes (Active Motif) were used to achieve efficient sonication.

DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Ambion) was used to remove any contaminating DNA from RIP RNA samples. Total RNA from input samples was isolated with the use of TRIzol (Thermo Scientific) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol and treated with DNase I using the DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Ambion). Input RNA was saved without applying sonication because we observed lower quality sequencing libraries when using sonicated input RNA than when using input RNA that was heat-fragmented. Saved input RNA was therefore heat-fragmented for 8 min at 94\u00b0C before proceeding with library construction. Due to the large size of RNA fragments observed after SND1 immunoprecipitation, isolated RNA from RIP samples was further fragmented for 7 min at 94\u00b0C before first strand synthesis. 100 to 200 ng of each input and RIP sample was used for NGS libraries which were made using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA library production kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All samples were multiplexed and sequenced on two 151 bp paired-end lanes on a HiSeq 3000 instrument (Illumina). For RIP-seq, two independent biological replicates were prepared for each time point analysed (0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation). Additionally, for one biological replicate, two technical replicates were deep-sequenced for all RIP samples. A third biological replicate RIP sample at 0 hr was also deep-sequenced.",

Input samples were processed together with immunoprecipitated samples from the proteinase K treatment onwards. Purified input and immunoprecipitated RNA was resuspended in 10 \u03bcl of RNase-free water and reverse transcribed as described in the RT-qPCR analysis section. qPCR normalisation was performed similarly to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled to detection by qPCR analysis using \u0394\u0394Ct method (relative quantification). An example for m6A-IPs follows. Each m6A-IP sample Ct value for each primer used was normalised to the corresponding input Ct value: \u0394Ct normalised m6A-IP = Ct m6A-IP \u2013 [Ct Input \u2013log2 (Input dilution factor)]. Input dilution factor = (fraction of the input reaction saved)\u22121. As 1% input was saved, the dilution factor is 100 or 6.644 cycles (i.e. log2 of 100). Percentage of recovery from the initial reaction (% input) was then calculated for each primer as 100 x Amplification efficiency (AE) (-\u0394Ct normalised m6A-IP). m6A enrichment was finally calculated as the fold change between the % input for a region containing m6A peaks over the % input for a negative control region. SND1 enrichment was calculated as the fold change between the % input for a region of interest over the % input for a region of a non-target control RNA such as 18S rRNA. For HEK-293 cells, RIP-qPCR was performed the same way as described for TREx BCBL1-Rta cells with the exception that the sonication time was reduced to eight min and 50 \u03bcg of fragmented RNA were used per IP.",

To define significantly enriched m6A peaks in both viral and cellular RNAs, a minimum fold change of m6A-IP reads over input reads of \u22651.5 in addition to a false discovery rate of 5% (FDR < 5%) was required in both biological replicates. Peaks positions were considered overlapping between replicates if the calls were within 100 nucleotides between corresponding positions. To determine the number of SND1 RNA targets identified by transcript-wide analysis that are m6A-modified, a more stringent m6A peak calling cut-off was used to compliment a more stringent SND1 RIP cut-off, with a minimum of 100 read paired at the tallest point in the m6A peak and a 2-fold enrichment of m6A-IP reads over input reads using a FDR < 1%. For target overlap between heterologously expressed YTH readers and SND1, high-confidence SND1-bound genes (summarised at HGNC gene symbol annotation level, where multiple Ensembl genes mapped to a symbol, the longest was used) were defined at a cut-off of FDR < 1% and a minimum of 2-fold RIP enrichment over input, while m6A peaks were used as before (FDR < 5%, 1.5 fold minimum enrichment in both replicates).",

R package Rsubread (Liao et al., 2014) was used to obtain raw read counts as follows. Each uniquely mapping read pair was counted towards the total transcript count for each sample, while multi-mapping reads were counted as partial reads, based on the number of mapped positions. Since the library preparation protocol preserved the strand of the original RNA molecule, only \u2018correctly\u2019 stranded read pairs were counted for each transcript. DESeq2 R package (Love et al., 2014) was used to normalise the data and identify transcripts that showed a significant increase in the coverage of the normalised RIP samples when compared to the input controls. In order to increase the resolution of the SND1-bound regions, custom Java code was used that identified transcriptome regions that were enriched in the RIP data when compared to the control data. Initially, the application segmented regions into intronic or exonic sequences: a region was classified as exonic if the sequence was present in at least one mature transcript. The per-base raw read coverage was determined for both intronic and exonic sequences and normalised using the size factors determined from the earlier normalisation step (DESeq2) to account for library compositions and sizes. Using a sliding window approach, first each mature transcript or intron was divided into contiguous segments that loosely showed putative enrichment in the RIP data (>1 fold enrichment) compared to the input data and those that putatively were depleted in (or equal to) RIP (\u22641 fold enrichment). Low coverage segments (<20 reads in RIP) were filtered out as quality control. All data from the different samples in the analysis were then merged to generate a single dataset that contained read depth data for all consensus segments identified this way, both intronic and exonic. Each segmented region was subsequently treated as an individual \u2018gene\u2019 for re-analysis using DESeq2, specifically testing for RIP signal enrichment over input (alternative hypothesis: normalised segment read coverage in RIP greater than in input) in order to identify regions with a significant increase in RIP over input signal.",

Binding reactions were incubated with increasing amounts of recombinant protein which was freshly isolated (e.g. no more than two days after purification from bacteria and stored at 4\u00b0C). The same biotinylated baits used in the RNA affinity experiments were used for EMSAs. All baits were used at 3.75 nM oligo final concentration, except for cORF50-1 which was used at 16 nM. Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 10 \u00b5l reactions were mixed with 2 \u00b5l of 5 X loading dye and 10 \u00b5l were loaded onto a 6% (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1 X TAE buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetate and 1 mM EDTA/NaOH pH 8.0).

After qPCR, a melting curve analysis was performed between 65\u00b0C and 95\u00b0C (with 0.2\u00b0C increments) to confirm amplification of a single product. To assess primer amplification efficiency (AE), for each gene of interest a standard curve was constructed using a pool of cDNA derived from unreactivated and reactivated cells. At least four different dilutions of pool cDNA were quantified to generate a standard curve. The slope of the standard curve was used to calculate the AE of the primers using the formula: AE = (10\u22121/slope). For gene expression analysis all genes of interest were normalised against the housekeeping gene GAPDH (\u0394CT). A summary of all the primers used in this study is provided in Supplementary file 3.
