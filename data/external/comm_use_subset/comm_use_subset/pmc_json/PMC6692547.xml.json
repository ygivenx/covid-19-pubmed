Only one SNP was non\u2010synonymous and resulted in an isoleucine to leucine change at position 67 (in HA1). This particular polymorphism was near 100% frequency in the sequence reads and was four amino acids away from an established antibody epitope site (Site E).8 Both sequences (first isolate ORCH00001 and second isolate ORCH00002) were submitted to the GenBank\u00ae genetic sequence database and given accession numbers (MK262897 and MK262898, respectively).",

This occurred despite vaccine receipt and prior infection with the same influenza subtype. The timing of the first episode, relative to the second, was such that neutralizing antibodies should have been present.13 Although the two viruses were genetically similar and clustered with other viruses that circulated within the community, it is possible that the I67L polymorphism could impart a structural change affecting antibody recognition. This case suggests that an influenza virus can evade the immune response of an immunocompetent, vaccinated child who was recently infected with a similar virus.",

A focus on medically attended influenza would have missed this case. Cocirculation of clade 3C2.a2 variants within a single community causing reinfection may offer a possible explanation for the prolonged and intense influenza season experienced in 2017\u20102018. Further assessments are needed to assess the frequency of within\u2010season reinfection with influenza A (H3N2).",
