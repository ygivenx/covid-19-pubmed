Although overall mortality associated with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm09) infection was considered low, individuals at risk of complications were identified, such as immunocompromised individuals that included HIV-infected [2], [3]. As a prevention strategy, vaccination was recommended to HIV-infected individuals following the same recommendations for healthy individuals [4], [5]. However, there was uncertainty regarding the best vaccination schedule for patients with impaired immunity [6], [7]. Although few studies have explored modified vaccination regimens for this population, further studies are needed to evaluate vaccine dosage and number of applications, and novel adjuvants [8].",

The non-inferiority limit for seroconversion and ratios of geometric mean titers were \u221210% and 0.5, respectively. Statistical significance of differences between proportions was assessed using the chi-squared test. Comparison of means was based on the t-test. Cumulative curves of antibody titers were compared across groups using the Log-rank test. All tests used 95% confidence limits. Logistic regression was used to adjust the degree of association of the vaccination schemes to seroconversion at 42 days after baseline for demographic and clinical factors. Likewise, the association of antibody titers to relevant covariates was explored in multiple regression models.",

Studies from the northern hemisphere enrolled patients from November to December of 2009, which overlapped with the second wave of the H1N1pdm09 pandemic in these locations [20]. Since circulating and vaccine strains of H1N1pdm09 virus were virtually the same, sub-clinical infection with the circulating viruses may have boosted the immune response in individuals from the northern hemisphere, leading to higher HA titers. In Brazil, in contrast, vaccination was carried out prior to the southern hemisphere\u2019s winter of 2010. H1N1pdm09 circulation in 2010 in Brazil decreased significantly when compared to 2009 [20]. In fact, the Brazilian surveillance system detected influenza A H3N2 and B circulation in 2010, but no concomitant H1N1pdm09 circulation [20]. Thus, there was minimal H1N1pdm09 circulation during our study and, consequently, immune boosts due to virus circulation were unlikely. In our study, one third of the HIV-infected participants had seroprotective antibody titers at baseline. This value is higher than that observed in other H1N1pdm09 studies conducted in the northern hemisphere [6], [7], corroborating the high H1N1pdm09 circulation in 2009 in Brazil [9].",

These results are consistent with other reports of decreased sustained antibody response among HIV-infected adults [21]. Data on the durability of influenza antibodies after seasonal vaccination for the general population suggest that protection lasts for at least one year [22], [23]. For the HIV-infected population, very limited data is available as most studies only report 30-days of follow-up. Sustainability of antibody response is important since the influenza season often spans an estimated six months [24]. Furthermore, pandemic influenza infections may occur during non-seasonal months necessitating prolonged immunity [25]. Our study shows that a higher proportion of the patients who received two double doses were able to sustain protective antibody responses at six months. Thus, our data suggest that a modified vaccination schedule may confer higher sustained seroprotection. This finding has important implications for both HIV care and public health policy.",

Currently, there is increased awareness of the need for representative inclusion of women in HIV clinical trials. More than one third of our participants were women, a higher percentage when compared to all trials previously published on H1N1pdm09 vaccination among HIV-infected individuals.

A series of publications have described the similarities between the hemagglutinin from the 1918 and 2009 viruses, which are both low glycosylated [29], [30], [31]. Although more glycosylated than those from 1918 and 2009, viruses from the 1970s are also more similar to these agents than to viruses that circulated in 1990/2000 that are heavily glycosylated. Therefore, previous exposure to viruses from the 1970s could confer cross-immunity to H1N1pdm09. Consequently, it is possible that vaccination against H1N1pdm09 could have boosted an existing immunity to low glycosylated hemagglutinins, which is more likely to be present in participants aged >40 years.",
