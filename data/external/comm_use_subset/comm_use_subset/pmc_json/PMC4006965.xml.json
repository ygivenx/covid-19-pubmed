While influenza surveillance remains a priority, ILI can also be caused by a wide range of viral pathogens that present with a spectrum of respiratory symptoms [3-6]. In the tropics, viral respiratory pathogens have been reported to exhibit different seasonality and transmission characteristics compared to temperate climates [2,7-9]. This necessitates a better understanding of their epidemiology to assess the utility and importance of surveillance in these settings. The year-round circulation of respiratory viruses in the tropics may also predispose patients to co-infection with multiple pathogens, with implications for severity of disease [10,11] and secondary bacteria infection [12,13].",

The definition of FRI contrasts with influenza-like illness (ILI, defined as fever \u226538.0\u00b0C with cough or sore throat) to broaden the capture of other febrile cases that also result in absenteeism while limiting cases to those with fever as an indicator of severity.

Detailed laboratory methods were previously described [14]. We used the multiplex PCR strategy based on the Resplex assays described below, and performed additional singleplex PCR assays to determine the influenza subtype. Total nucleic acids were extracted from each specimen using the DNA minikit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A total of 20 \u03bcl of extract were tested with Resplex I and II (version 2.0, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) [18] for respiratory micro-organisms on the LiquiChip 200 Workstation, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The Resplex I and II (version 2.0) assays are multiplex PCR assays coupled with bead array detection technology and can simultaneously detect and subtype 18 different pathogens including influenza A (FLU-A) and influenza B (FLU-B). Specimens that were Resplex II positive for FLU-A were further subtyped with real-time PCR for H1 or H3 (Singapore Ministry of Health), or for FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09. Briefly, 5 \u03bcl of total genetic extracts were tested using an in-house developed assay based on the one-step SuperscriptIII/Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the LightCycler machine from Roche or the Applied Biosystems real-time PCR machine (7500).",

We counted the clinical symptoms/signs and calculated the corresponding empirical proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the overall symptom load. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the differences in symptom expressions for each pair. Differences were identified at a significance level of 0.05. To assess the presence of paired symptoms/signs for all viruses, we conducted binomial tests to compare the joint proportions of symptom pairs occurring together to the expected proportions assuming independence of symptoms. The ratio of the observed proportion of symptom pairs relative to the product of the marginal proportion of each symptom is defined as the excess probability ratio which measures effect size. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of having an individual symptom/sign among viral mono-infections by assigning a categorical variable for all viruses as the primary predictor. Potential confounding was addressed by adjusting the model for age, smoking status, asthma and heart disease. Non-significant variables were dropped at a significance level of 0.05 to obtain the final model. Statistical analyses were performed using the R Statistical Software (version 3.0.0) [19].",
