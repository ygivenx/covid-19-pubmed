This is especially important regarding the fact that intracellular infections are difficult to eradicate (1) and infected cells and tissues are considered as microorganisms reservoirs, which may release them from time to time resulting in the recurrence of various systemic infections (2). Various colloidal systems such as niosomes, liposomes, microemulsions and micro and nanoparticles are amongst the most important drug delivery systems which are utilized for the preparation of such targeted carriers (3, 4). For instance Lutwyche et al. achieved a higher intracellular antibiotic delivery by gentamicin encapsulation in a liposomal drug delivery system and an increased therapeutic activity against intracellular pathogens was achieved (5).",

The developed nanoparticles have the potential to target infected tissues and phagocytic cells and exert their antibacterial effect on various microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) were chosen as model bacteria for evaluating the effect of the developed nanoparticles on microbial organisms as they are considered as the most significant bacteria involved in various infectious diseases in human being and are internalized in phagocytic cells (-). S. aureus is a widespread pathogen which is considered to be responsible for food poisoning and nosocomial infections (21). S. epidermidis is another pathogen which is involved in extraneous devices and implants related infections due to its particular capability of growing biofilms on polymer surfaces (22). P. aeruginosa is a gram negative bacterium which is another common cause of nosocomial infections, where only a limited number of antibacterial agents show an acceptable defense against this organism (23).

Finally the solution was centrifuged three times (Sigma 3K30, Osterode, Germany) at 21000 rpm for 30 min in order to remove any extra PVA and was then lyophilized (Christ Alpha 1-4, Osterode, Germany).

Encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, size, polydispersity index and zeta potential of GLA loaded NPs are reported in Table1. According to Table 1, NPs size was in the range of 175 to 212 nm and the prepared nanoparticles were highly uniform and monodispersed (Figures 1a and 1b). By increasing the drug to polymer ratio from 1:1 to 1:4, size was increased from 184 to 212 nm. This result may be related to an increase in viscous forces of droplets which resists against droplets break down by sonication especially in higher polymer concentrations. These resisting forces stand against the shear forces in the oil phase and determine the final size and particle size distribution in nanoparticles (26). Furthermore, Table 1 shows that by increasing the amount of polymer, higher encapsulation efficiencies were achieved. Maximum encapsulation efficiency was attained when the amount of drug to polymer ratio was 1:4. As it is observed higher polymer concentration is related to a higher encapsulation efficiency which may be explained in two different ways. First, it can be proposed that when the polymer concentration is high, the polymer molecules may precipitate on the surface of the dispersed phase droplets. As a result drug molecules diffusion through the two phases boundary is restricted and a higher encapsulation efficiency is achieved (27). Alternatively, it may be proposed that a higher polymer concentration can increase the viscosity of the system and make a barrier toward the free diffusion of drug molecules through the boundary phase of polymeric droplets (28).",

The ratio between continuous and dispersed phases may have an effect on the stability and size of nanoparticles.

It has been suggested that by increasing the ratio of aqueous phase, the external surface energy of oil droplets, will be dispersed in a higher volume and results in a lower droplet breakage and subsequently the particle size will be increased. It should be mentioned that GLA is poorly soluble in water and has a higher affinity for the oil phase in an oil in water emulsion which will lead to a higher entrapment efficiency and drug loading with increasing the oil phase ratio (9).",

The results shown in Table 1 suggest that an increase in the sonication time would result in a reduction in the size of nanoparticles. When a higher sonication time (10 min) is utilized, the high energy results in a rapid dispersion of oil droplets with a smaller size and a monomodal profile of distribution. The emulsification step is one of the most vital steps in the nanoparticles formation process. Inappropriate phase dispersion will result in the formation of larger particles with a wider particle size distribution.

This reduced negative charge may be attributed to the higher amount of unentrapped drug molecules with lower polymer concentrations and their shielding effect on the carboxylic moieties of PLGA molecules on the particle surface (29). It has been shown that the extent of phagocytosis is increased with an increase in NPs zeta potential where the minimum phagocytosis is related to the instance in which zeta potential is approximately zero (30). On the other hand, due to the negative surface charge of endothelial cells and their repulsive forces toward the negatively charged NPs, the half life of these NPs may increase in blood systemic circulation keeping the NPs more available to the phagocytic cells (31).",

Due to the amorphous nature of PLGA, no melting point was observed in PLGA thermograms. The pure GLA demonstrated a sharp peak at 300 \u00b0C which can be related to its melting point. The DSC thermograms of the physical mixture of GLA and PLGA showed peaks which were the result of plain superposition of each of the two substances DSC thermograms. The enthalpy reduction for the physical mixture of drug and polymer can be explained by the presence of smaller amount of drug molecules in the mixture in comparison with pure drug. The DSC curve of GLA containing NPs did not show the endothermic peak of GLA which suggests that the drug is incorporated into the nanoparticles in a disordered and amorphous shape. Any severe alteration in the thermal behavior of either the polymer or the drug may be related to drug polymer interaction (33). In the current study no formation of any new peak and no shifting of any peak in the DSC thermogram was observed. ",

Drug release rate from various drug delivery systems is usually controlled by dissolution and/or diffusion (34). In this study the presence of water insoluble polymer in NPs matrix composition may interfere with the drug release from NPs where it can reduce the amount of water penetration in NPs and subsequently affect drug dissolution and diffusion. PLGA microparticles drug release is usually composed of two phases of initial burst release followed by a slower release phase. This burst release is of special importance as it affects microparticles toxicity and their therapeutic efficacy. The burst release is generally defined as the total amount of released drug from the particulate system through the first 24 h. this total amount of drug release is normally about 10 to 80% of the total drug loading in such particles (35, 36).",

The results showed that during the first 10 h, an initial burst release led to an early release of 100%, 55% and 29% of drug from pure GLA, GLA loaded NPs with 1:1 drug to polymer ratio and GLA loaded NPs with 1:3 drug to polymer ratio, respectively. The burst release of GLA may be related to the drug molecules that are poorly entrapped in the polymer matrix.
