Unfortunately, this is not the case for influenza, RSV, and other viral respiratory infections. Despite the enormous global health impact of viral respiratory infections [4], accurate viral and immune markers to predict clinical outcomes for patients are still lacking. Several methods have been used to precisely correlate viral copy number and disease severity [5\u20139]. Molecular quantitative assays have been suggested to detect and monitor clinical viral respiratory disease, particularly in immunosuppressed pediatric patients [10]. However, their results are conflicting and there continues to be a lack of clinical tests to accurately measure viral load [5, 6, 8, 9]. Furthermore, respiratory infections in these patients are associated with prolonged viral shedding and concerns for emergent antiviral resistance (for those in whom the viral infection is treatable). Quantitative determination of viral load may provide an important tool to directly evaluate the efficiency of antiviral therapy, to determine if changes in therapy are necessary and to assess need for further isolation to protect transmission to other highly susceptible hosts. These problems highlight the importance and potential value of developing assays for absolute, precise and reliable quantitative viral detection to improve the accuracy of clinical decision making in immunocompromised children with viral respiratory infections.",

Quantitative determinations by real-time PCR are indirect and provide a relative quantification of viral load [12]. However, the precision of such assays is limited by the nature of cycle threshold (Ct) determination with resulting values having a relative standard deviation that can exceed 50% [13\u201315]. In addition, assay workflow and design is complicated by the need for quantitative calibrators, introducing error risk and requirements for consistent supplies of well-characterized, commutable reference material. The latter can be particularly difficult to obtain for less commonly quantified viruses in general, and particularly for RNA viruses, such as those studied here [16\u201321]. Marked variation in assay performance characteristics and in materials used as calibration has been described. The implementation of international standards, such as those that have been made available by the World Health Organization (WHO) has led to reduction of this problem. However, standards are only available for a limited number of pathogens and can vary over time [22, 23].",

            "text": "Digital PCR (dPCR) is a PCR method for the detection and quantitation of nucleic acids [14, 18, 24]. dPCR offers several advantages over real time methods [21, 25]. Digital PCR differs from real-time methods in the way the sample target is measured, by dividing up the reaction into multiple, smaller endpoint reactions which allows direct absolute quantification of the target [17, 26, 27]. dPCR methods do not depend on calibration curves [19, 25, 28] and are less subject to enzyme inhibition as they employ endpoint amplification [26, 29, 30]. They are more robust in the presence of viral sequence heterogeneity, showing less susceptibility to mismatches between primers-probe patient viral sequence. Such miss-matches are more likely to cause false-negative results or under-quantitation using qPRC, compared to dPCR [11, 31, 32]. This is particularly important for RNA viruses which have high mutation rates and need only a few weeks to escape immune response or to produce drug-resistant mutants [31, 33\u201336]. Finally, clinical results generated by dPCR are more precise, reliable and reproducible than those by real-time PCR, thereby highlighting its potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive utility. Although dPCR has been previously used for quantitative detection of systemic viruses [17, 37, 38], its use has been more limited for localized viral infections such as those in the respiratory tract.",

Medical records were reviewed to extract information on age, gender, race, primary diagnosis, date of infection with influenza or RSV, symptoms and clinical course, other laboratory results, supportive and antiviral treatment. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was defined by crackles, hypoxia, tachypnea, or apnea and/or radiographic evidence of pneumonia (infiltrates or consolidation). The institutional infection control and prevention policies mandate that patients with either influenza or RSV infection have a negative test in order to discontinue isolation precautions. As a result, many patients get subsequent testing even in the absence of symptoms. Patients were considered asymptomatic if there were no symptoms at the time of sample collection.

For RSV, viral load was significantly associated with severity or presence of respiratory illness in children \u22645 years of age. An analysis of cycle threshold values and disease severity in 4410 patients by Fuller et al. showed that in those with RSV infection, viral load was associated with disease severity only in patients younger than 2 years of age [15]. DeVincenzo et al. reported that patients intubated because of RSV-induced respiratory distress had higher viral loads than those who were not, and that higher viral loads were associated with longer hospitalization [5]. We could not measure viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples in our study. However, a study showed that viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tracts are strongly correlated when measured at the same time [41]. In an autopsy study of patients with fatal RSV LTRI, the viral antigen was extensively present in the lung tissue [42]. This points to a possible association between viral load and RSV disease severity. However, many studies have not found this association [6, 7]. Gerna et al. reported a direct relationship between viral loads and clinical symptoms in their patient cohort, but viral loads were not associated with an increased risk of developing bronchiolitis [7].",

In contrast, Meschi et al. found no significant increase in mean values of viral RNA concentration in patients with pneumonia.

Reduction of influenza and RSV viral loads by using different treatments has been reported in several animal models [59, 60]. However, few studies report the reduction of viral loads after treatment that are associated with clinical improvement in humans, particularly children at high risk of severe infection. Clinical trials of adults experimentally infected RSV show reduction in viral loads after treatment [61, 62]. Khanna et al. reported a decrease of >2 log10 copies/mL in RSV load in 11 (58%) of 19 adult patients with hematologic malignancies within 7 days of initiating treatment [63]. Several case reports and case series have described the role of oseltamivir in decreasing viral load in respiratory secretions [40, 64, 65]. The significant reduction in viral load for both influenza virus and RSV seen in our study agrees with these studies.",

Assays reported to date have been performed using real-time PCR. dPCR provides advantages such as endpoint quantitation without the need for calibration curves, improved precision, and reduced likelihood of quantitative bias based on amplification efficiency or inhibition [17, 26, 27]. From 137 samples that were initially positive by BioFire FilmArray\u00ae, 19 were negative by dPCR. All 19 samples were collected after completion of antiviral treatment. This might be anticipated due to subsampling error in patients with very low viral load or due to some degree of sample degradation in similarly low load samples (near the assay LOD). These results are in agreement with previous work from our group and others on cytomegalovirus, showing that although dPCR exhibits increased precision over qPCR at higher viral loads, diminished sensitivity can be seen in samples with low viral load values, potentially attributable to reduced input sample volume in the dPCR system [66\u201368].",

Hence, the timing of acquiring the second or subsequent samples with respect to clinical disease and treatment varied among patients, as did the volume retrieved during nasal washes collection. Clinical information was obtained retrospectively by chart review. Given the lack of commercially available quantitative standards it is difficult to develop quantitative real time PCR methods. Therefore, we did not develop a real time assay to perform a direct comparison of quantification between real-time methods and dPCR but rather sought to develop and validate a digital PCR assay that performs well, correlates with clinical disease and can be used to monitor response to antiviral therapy. A highlight of our study was that most patients in our cohort were immunocompromised and represented a population in which respiratory infections can be severe and could therefore potentially benefit from reliable measurement of viral loads.",

Digital PCR offers an effective method to monitor the efficacy of antiviral treatment for respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts with the potential to aid in decisions regarding therapy and isolation.
