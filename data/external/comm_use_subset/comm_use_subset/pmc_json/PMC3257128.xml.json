A treatment of hypertension is to decrease the circulating volume and/or to slack the blood vessels [2]. Angiotensin II has important roles not only in the regulation of blood pressure but also in the development of vascular wall remodeling [3]. Conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) is catalyzed by well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is a metallo-proteinase with dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase activity. However, chymase (EC 3.4.21.39) which is a chymotrypsin-like enzyme expressed in the secretory granule of mast cells, also catalyzes the production of angiotensin II in vascular tissues even when ACE is blocked (Figure 1).",

Chymase shows enzymatic activity immediately after its release into the interstitial tissues at pH 7.4 following various stimuli in tissues. Since chymase has no enzymatic activity in normal tissues, chymase inhibitors are expected to have high safety because chymase inhibitors may not have an effect on any other targets in normal tissues [5]. In order to generate Ang II, human, monkey, dog and hamster chymases cleave the angiotensin I at Phe8-His9 peptide bond. Chymase also converts precursors of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 to their active forms thus contributing to vascular response to injury. Both TGF-\u03b2 and MMP-9 are involved in tissue inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in organ damage [6]. Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of chymase in the escalation of dermatitis and chronic inflammation pursuing cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis [7]. Therefore, inhibition of chymase is likely to divulge therapeutic ways for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, allergic inflammation, and fibrotic disorders. Chymase inhibition may also be useful for preventing the progression of type 2 diabetes, along with the prevention of diabetic retinopathy [8]. Moreover, the role of chymase in inflammation has prompted its restorative value in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma [9].",

In general, chymase inhibitors readily decompose in plasma, thus the stability of the chymase inhibitors in human plasma has always been a matter of great concern. For a drug candidate, it is essential to enhance the stability of the active compound in human plasma. So, there is always a dire need to search for more stable inhibitors with high activity against human chymase.",

Electronic molecular features such as electron density, frontier molecular orbital density fields such as lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and molecular electrostatic map have also been revealed to be significant in other QSAR studies to explain biological activity and molecular properties [52]. The HOMO density field was useful in a study of ACE inhibitors, and the LUMO density field was found to be important for explaining the TA100 mutagenicity [53,54]. Thus, determining molecular electronic properties responsible for the potent activity of selected chymase inhibitors should illuminate the fundamental molecular level forces responsible for their potency.",

The obtained hits are scrutinized based on their estimated activity and calculated drug-like properties. Molecular docking is also performed for the evaluation of compounds for important binding site interactions and affinity. Finally, we have carried out DFT-based QSAR studies on a set of chymase inhibitors retaining structural diversity and a wide biological activity range, along with potent hits retrieved by newly developed pharmacophore model (Hypo1). The objective of this DFT study is two-fold. One purpose is to derive the QSAR model itself and the other is to scrutinize the usefulness of conceptual DFT quantities. Moreover, it also served as a validation technique for the generated pharmacophore model. Various electronic properties such as LUMO, HOMO, and locations of molecular electrostatic potentials, are computed. The results of this study are expected to explore the crucial molecular features contributing to binding specificity and be useful for understanding the molecular mechanism by which these compounds act and can be further utilized to get compounds with better activity by rational modification.",

For a more statistically significant hypothesis, there should be greater difference between these two cost values. The possibility of correlating the experimental and estimated activity data enhances to 75\u201390% with a cost difference of 40\u201360 bits between the total and null cost values [57,58].

Moreover, the total cost of the generated hypothesis should be closer to the fixed cost. All ten generated hypotheses scored a total cost closer to the fixed cost which leads to a good model.

The hit compounds that showed a fitness score of more than 66 were selected as final hits for further evaluation process.

Compound HTS12673 which showed an estimated activity value of 6.716 nM has scored a GOLD fitness score of 78.73.

The correlation of HOMO energies with IC50 data indicates that the HOMO of the inhibitor may transfer its electrons to less energy, LUMO, of some amino residues in the active site of chymase. The calculations show that compounds 1 and 20 have shown the highest (\u22125.873 eV) and lowest (\u22126.415 eV) HOMO level energies respectively. This trend is in good agreement with the experimental observations suggesting that compounds 1 and 20 have exhibited the highest (0.46 nM) and lowest (5900 nM) inhibitory profile, respectively, in all investigated chymase inhibitors.

Experimental study also deduced that introduction of heteroatoms to the inhibitor compound enhanced its stability in human plasma (20). For instance, the placement of an ethoxy group in compound 2 instigated its stability. Electron donor rings can be identified as those with the greatest electron density from the HOMO. In the case of compound 1, HOMO is scattered over the 4-methylpiperazine moiety together with the carbonyl group and LUMO is spread over the region 2-hydroxyl-4-oxoazetidine containing heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen. Docking results also showed that this region of compound 1 is involved in important interactions with the key residues of protein. For compound 20, HOMO is composed of aniline ring and LUMO spreads over sulfonyl and benzoic acid groups. LUMO plot over methylbenzenesulfonamide group in hit compounds BTB showed hydrogen bonding interactions with important amino acids Gly193 and Ser195 at the active site of the enzyme. Whereas the HOMO plot is scattered on 2-methoxyphenol group and dihydroquinazolin moiety, the six membered ring part of dihydroquinazolin group is involved in important \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions with the side chain imidazole ring of His57 amino acid.

Overlay of HTS on \u201cHypo1\u201d and its docking with the protein also speculated the involvement of these groups in key interactions with the active site of protein. The effect of the orbital energies on the inhibition activities can be associated with the charge transfer, \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0, or \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c3 stacking between inhibitors and aromatic amino acid residues in the binding site of chymase.

Daga and Doerksen have stated the binding mode and the role of stereoelectronic properties in binding of spiroquinazolinones showing phosphodiesterase 7 (PDE7) inhibitory activities [64]. Recently, the electrostatic funnel illuminated from three-dimensional mapping of the electrostatic potential was reported by Dehez et al., driving the diphosphate nucleotide rapidly toward the bottom of the internal cavity of membrane-protein mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier by forming a privileged passageway [65]. Considering these discoveries comprehensively, we supposed that the electrostatic potential of the inhibitor also played a significant role in the binding and interaction with chymase together with orbital energy and consequently influenced the inhibition effect. The 3D isosurface maps of MESP were interpolated on the electron density surfaces of constant electron charge density (0.0004 e/au3). As is well known, the electrostatic potential is defined as the interacted energy of a positively remote charge point with the nuclei and the electrons of a molecule.

For hit compounds, appearance of localized negative potential regions located at the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl and sulfonyl groups and nitrogen of the pyridine ring are consistent with the docking results which recognized this region as hydrogen bond acceptor. Moreover, one more prominent localized negative charged region protruding over the oxadiazole group was oriented adjacent to Gly193, to be recognized as a hydrogen bond acceptor. The strong electrostatic interaction of the negative potential with key residues Gly193 and Ser195, namely the formation of the hydrogen bond, will enhance the inhibition effect substantially together with the orbital interaction through the exchange of energy. The blue electropositive maps of these compounds were mainly distributed over the methyl group.

The HypoGen algorithm implemented for the pharmacophore hypothesis generation process is executed in three phases, namely, constructive, subtractive, and optimization phases. In constructive phase, identification of features common to the most active compounds takes place whereas all pharmacophoric features that are also present in the least active compounds are removed in subtractive phase. Finally, in the optimization phase, the hypothesis score is improved by regression parameters which are used for the estimation of the activity value of each training set compound. The relationship between the geometric fit value and activity value is utilized for this computation. Pharmacophore hypotheses showing best correlation in the 3D arrangement of features in a given training set compounds with the corresponding pharmacological activities are formed and ranked. Several structure activity relationship (SAR) pharmacophore models were derived from training set compounds using HypoGen module of DS. In this study, the top 10 hypotheses which were returned by the hypotheses generation process with significant statistical parameters were selected for further calculations.",

            "text": "The generated quantitative pharmacophore model was validated to find out whether it is competent enough to identify the active structures and estimate their activity values precisely. This validation process was performed based on test set prediction and Fischer randomization methods. In developing statistical models, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine a model or predictor for its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test [69]. However, of the three test methods, the jackknife test is deemed the most objective [29]. The reasons are as follows. (i) For the independent dataset test, although all the samples used to test the model or predictor are outside the training dataset used to train it so as to exclude the \u201cmemory\u201d effect or bias, the way of how to select the independent samples to test the model or predictor could be quite arbitrary unless the number of independent proteins is sufficiently large. This kind of arbitrariness might result in completely different conclusions. For instance, a model or predictor achieving a higher success rate than the other model or predictor for a given independent testing dataset might fail to keep so when tested by another independent testing dataset [69]; (ii) For the subsampling test, the concrete procedure usually used in literatures is the 5-fold, 7-fold or 10-fold cross-validation. The problem with this kind of subsampling test is that the number of possible selections in dividing a benchmark dataset is an astronomical figure even for a very simple dataset, as elucidated demonstrated by Equations 28\u201330 in [70]. Therefore, in any actual subsampling cross-validation tests, only an extremely small fraction of the possible selections are taken into account. Since different selections will always lead to different results even for a same benchmark dataset and a same model or predictor, the subsampling test cannot avoid the arbitrariness either. A test method unable to yield a unique outcome cannot be deemed as a good one; (iii) In the jackknife test, all the samples in the benchmark dataset will be singled out one-by-one and tested by the model or predictor trained by the remaining samples. During the process of jackknifing, both the training dataset and testing dataset are actually open, and each sample will be in turn moved between the two. The jackknife test can exclude the \u201cmemory\u201d effect. Also, the arbitrariness problem as mentioned above for the independent dataset test and subsampling test can be avoided because the outcome obtained by the jackknife cross-validation is always unique for a given benchmark dataset. Accordingly, the jackknife test has been increasingly and widely used by those investigators with strong math background to examine the quality of various predictors (see e.g., [30,71\u201375]). However, to reduce the computational time, we adopted the independent testing dataset cross-validation in this study as done by many investigators with SVM as the prediction engine. A test set comprising 97 compounds with experimentally known chymase inhibitory activity values was used in test set prediction method. Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping protocol running with BEST/Flexible conformation generation option was used to map the test set compounds. Fischer randomization method as available in DS was applied on training set compounds to prove that the generated pharmacophore model was not obtained by chance. A pharmacophore is only useful as a predictive model in finding novel, potential leads suitable for further development only if it is able to detect the compounds with known inhibitory activity. In order to identify new potential lead compounds, the selected pharmacophore model was subsequently used as 3D structural search query to screen the Maybridge and Chembridge chemical databases consisting of 60,000 and 50,000 of structurally assorted compounds, respectively. All queries were performed using Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping protocol running with Best/Flexible search method in DS. To be retrieved as a hit, a molecule must fit all the features of the pharmacophore hypothesis. The hits obtained through database screening were further filtered using Lipinsiki\u2019s rule of five in order to carry only drug-like compounds in further studies.",

            "text": "Computational docking operation is a useful vehicle for investigating the interaction of a protein receptor with its ligand and revealing their binding mechanism as demonstrated by a series of studies [18,46,76\u201384]. Docking plays a significant role in predicting binding orientation and affinity of small molecule drug candidates to their protein targets with known 3D structures [85,86]. Hence, docking serves as an important tool in the rational computer-assisted drug design [87,88]. GOLD 4.1 (Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking) from Cambridge Crystallographic Data center, UK uses a genetic algorithm for docking ligands into protein binding sites to explore the full range of ligand conformational flexibility with partial flexibility of protein [89]. In this study, it has been utilized for the docking of training set compounds along with the new hits retrieved from chemical databases. Protein coordinates from the crystal structure of chymase co-crystallized with \u03b2-ketophosphonate (PDB ID: 1T31), determined at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 were used to define the active site [9]. All the water molecules present in the protein were removed and hydrogen atoms were added. The active site was defined with a 10 \u00c5 radius around the ligand present in the crystal structure. At the end of the computation, the 10 top-scoring conformations of every ligand were saved. Early termination option was applied to pass over the genetic optimization calculation when any five conformations of a particular compound were envisaged within an RMS deviation value of 1.5 \u00c5. The GOLD fitness score is calculated from the contributions of hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions between the protein and ligand, intramolecular hydrogen bonds and strains of the ligand. The protein\u2013ligand interactions were scrutinized by DS.",

After successfully validating \u201cHypo1\u201d using test set and Fischer randomization methods, it was further used in database screening. Hit compounds were subjected to various drug-like filtrations and molecular docking studies. Finally, three structurally diverse compounds with high estimated activity and strong molecular interactions with key active site amino acids were identified. Furthermore, a DFT study, which articulated the influence of the electrostatic features of compounds on their inhibitory activity well, was performed. Analysis of orbital energies and plots of MESP has shown very clear trends between electronic properties and inhibitory activity (IC50) data. An increasing trend was observed between IC50 and HOMO energy values. The molecular electrostatic potential features were also consistent with the key chemical features of \u201cHypo1\u201d thus successfully validating \u201cHypo1\u201d by the DFT method. Therefore, the results of this study will be helpful, not only in the development of new potent hits for chymase, but also in providing a better understanding of the interaction between the chymase and inhibitors. This will in turn assist in the rational design of novel potent enzyme inhibitors.",
