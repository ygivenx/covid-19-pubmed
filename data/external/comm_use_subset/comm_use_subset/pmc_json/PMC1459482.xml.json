            "text": "Epidemics of Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever result in a fatal illness in the majority of patients who become infected, with case-fatality rates nearing 90%. Studies of patients who survive infection indicate that components of the adaptive immune system are activated in infected survivors [1], suggesting that vaccination of target populations could significantly reduce mortality from exposure to Ebola virus. We previously described a vaccine that elicits strong adaptive immune responses and uniformly protects nonhuman primates from a high-dose challenge with Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) [2,3]. A single immunization with vectors derived from adenovirus type 5 (5 Ad5) containing Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes elicited protective immune responses within 1 mo. The strength of rAd5 vectors for use as vaccines derives from their ability to elicit rapid immunity due to high insert expression levels and natural targeting of Ad5 to dendritic cells, which may enhance antigen presentation. Moreover, the use of replication-defective viral vectors for gene delivery is desirable from a safety perspective for products that will be developed for human use.",

Ebola virus comprises four species, ZEBOV, Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV), Ivory Coast, and Reston, with ZEBOV and SEBOV contributing the highest mortality in natural outbreaks. Therefore, the Zaire and Sudan (Gulu) ebolaviruses were selected for studies in which we sought to provide a basis for selection of a human vaccine candidate by identifying the optimal vaccine composition with respect to antigen strength and immune protection in nonhuman primates. Ebola NP was included in the vaccine because it is highly conserved among Ebola subtypes and has been found to elicit strong cellular immune responses in animal models [4,5].",

Homologous recombination led to the generation of rAd5-Ebola GP viruses. Adenoviral vectors in crude lysates were plaque-purified using limiting dilutions and agar overlays, and Ad vector clones were analyzed for presence and expression of the transgene. Positive clones were amplified for large-scale production using PER.C6 cells in 48 triple-layer 3 \u00d7 175 cm2 flasks. Viruses were purified by standard two-step CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation and subsequently desalted and formulated by three consecutive dialysis steps into Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2.5% glycerol. Purified Ad vectors were stored as single use aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C. Virus particle titers were determined by anion-exchange HPLC based on described procedures [8].

Deletion of the transmembrane domain eliminated GP-induced cytopathicity in transfected HEK293 cells in contrast to wild-type GP (Figure 1B), but total \u0394TM expression was equivalent to wild-type protein levels (Figure 1A). To determine whether the \u0394TM mutant of the ZEBOV could protect against infectious Ebola challenge, cynomolgus macaques were immunized with rAd vectors encoding NP and either \u0394TM(Z) or GP(Z). Immunization with GP(Z) + NP protected all animals vaccinated with either 1011 or 1012 adenoviral particles and challenged with 1,000 pfu of ZEBOV 28 d later (Figure 2A). In contrast, survival frequencies decreased in animals receiving the \u0394TM(Z) vaccine. In the group vaccinated with 1012 adenoviral particles, protective immunity was decreased by 33% and, at 1011, by 66%, indicating a substantial decrease in efficacy in animals vaccinated with \u0394TM + NP versus GP + NP (p < 0.05). In a separate experiment (unpublished data), 1011 particles of \u0394TM alone failed to protect against infection. Analysis of cell-mediated immune responses showed that GP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were present in the majority of animals by 3 wk postimmunization (Figure 2B, left and middle panels, respectively) and correlated well with NP-specific cellular responses (unpublished data). Antigen-specific cellular responses measured by intracellular cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1]) secretion were indistinguishable between GP(Z)- and \u0394TM(Z)-vaccinated animals. Similarly, humoral immune responses measured by anti-Ebola GP ELISA IgG titers were comparable in all vaccinated animals (Figure 2B, right graph). Neutralizing antibody titers were low, and were absent in some surviving animals (unpublished data).

To establish the lowest dose of adenoviral vectors that would afford protection against Ebola infection, a dose-response analysis was performed. Animals were immunized with rAd vectors encoding GP(Z) and NP at increasing doses from 109 to 1012 particles per animal. Survival was 100% in all groups receiving a dose of 1010 or greater, whereas challenge infection was uniformly lethal in the 109 dose group (Figure 3A). Ebola virus isolation from plasma by plaque assay on Vero cells was negative for all surviving animals (unpublished data). Plasma could in theory contain factors such as immunoglobulin or cytokines that could impede virus replication. While other methods, such as RT-PCR, could potentially be used to detect such virus, a negative signal with this assay is not conclusive of sterilizing immunity, and no clear correlation between viremia and mortality has been established in nonhuman primate models of Ebola virus infection. Survival was therefore used as the study endpoint in these experiments. Prechallenge CD4+ T cell responses for TNF-\u03b1 were unremarkable, as reported previously for immunized cynomolgus macaques (Figure 3B). CD8+ T cell responses were similar across vaccine dose groups, except for the higher responder immunized at 1012 rAd particles. Antigen-specific IgG was also generated in immunized animals, and the levels were equivalent among animals in the groups that survived Ebola virus challenge (Figure 3C, left graph). However, there was a difference of more than one log (p = 0.004) in IgG levels between survivors immunized at 1010 particles (9,600 \u00b1 6,000) and fatalities immunized at 109 rAd particles (600 \u00b1 300), suggesting that such levels may correlate with protection for this immunization regimen. In contrast, neutralizing antibody titers against GP did not differ significantly between survivors and fatalities (Figure 3C, right graph), suggesting that ELISA IgG titers may be a stronger predictor of protective immunity for this vaccine. These results indicated that the threshold for immune protection lies at about 1010 rAd particles. Therefore, subsequent experiments were carried out using this dose to increase sensitivity to detect differences in antigenic strength between various immunogens.",

Deletion of the GP transmembrane domain abolished cytopathic effects in transfected HEK293 cells, but the corresponding \u0394TM(Z) vaccine was less efficacious than wild-type GP(Z) in protecting the cynomolgus macaques against infection. Although cellular and humoral immune responses were indistinguishable between groups receiving the different immunogen forms, the inherent variability in quantitating the responses in outbred macaques may obscure our ability to identify immune responses responsible for higher survival. Alternatively, \u0394TM(Z) may differ from wild-type GP(Z) in antigenic qualities that are not captured by measurements of total antigen-specific IgG or intracellular cytokine responses stimulated by a broad peptide pool. For example, the transmembrane-deleted protein is secreted and likely shows conformational differences from the membrane-anchored protein. Subsequent modifications of the glycoprotein to retain membrane attachment and a more native envelope structure yielded a mutant, E71D, with reduced in vitro cytopathicity. Recently, it was suggested that this region of GP contributes to viral receptor binding [22]. It is noteworthy that the envelope glycoprotein cytopathicity of other viruses such as HIV is linked to receptor binding and fusion [23], raising the possibility that Ebola GP shares similar properties.",

Since the vaccine will be licensed initially against one agent, protective immunity was evaluated against challenge with this species, Zaire ebolavirus.

Preliminary studies suggest that protection can be observed in animals receiving the bivalent vaccine that survive ZEBOV challenge when subsequently exposed to the Gulu strain of SEBOV (unpublished data).

            "text": "In a dose-ranging experiment with rAd expressing GP and NP, immune protection correlated well with GP-specific ELISA IgG titers. This observation is consistent with early Ebola vaccine studies performed using a gene-based GP and NP vaccine in guinea pigs. In the current study there was also a trend toward increased survival in animals with higher CD8+ T cell responses when vaccines containing different antigen combinations were evaluated for protective efficacy. In combination, these findings suggest that the GP-specific humoral immune response provides a correlate of immunity; however, it is likely that the T cell response contributes to protection, and the Ig response may be a reflection of T cell help. Further improvements in the sensitivity of the T cell assay, as well as immune depletion studies, may provide further insight into this question.",

            "text": "Ebola virus protective immunity has also been achieved more recently using replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus vectors [24], supporting the concept that vaccination for Ebola can successfully protect against disease mortality. While this vaccine merits further investigation, and replication-competent viruses have contributed to many effective vaccines, concerns remain about live viruses because the amount of viral replication cannot be controlled, and their environmental effects are uncertain. Such considerations may pose challenges to development of vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccines for human use. The recent recommendation that the live-attenuated polio vaccine, a relatively safe vaccine, no longer be used in the United States [25], and the inactivated virus be used instead, exemplifies these challenges. In contrast, the rAd vector vaccine is nonreplicating and can be manufactured to high yields, and safety data exist for this platform. Here we show that immunity follows a single injection with 1010 rAd particles, a dose that is two orders of magnitude lower than previously reported for this single-modality vaccine. Such doses of rAd vectors have proved to be well tolerated and immunogenic for other recombinant genes in vivo and can be evaluated for the vectors reported here, alone or in DNA prime/rAd boost combinations. One theoretical concern regarding a rAd vaccine is the possibility that preexisting immunity to natural Ad5 infection, occurring in up to 50% of the U.S. population, may affect vaccine efficacy. Recent preliminary results from HIV vaccine trials suggest that antigen-specific immune responses can be readily elicited by rAd5 vectors even in study participants with prior immunity to adenovirus type 5, especially when vaccine doses higher than 109 are used (unpublished data). Given that Ebola GP is more immunogenic than HIV Env, we would expect that significant immune responses can be generated to the present vaccine; future clinical trials will resolve this question. In addition, DNA priming can be used prior to rAd boost to overcome Ad immunity and has also been shown to be effective in preventing Ebola infection [2]. In case Ad5 immunity should become problematic, several alternative rAd platforms, involving Ad35 and other exotic serotypes, are under development. Preexisting immunity to Ad35 is quite low (\u223c10%\u201315%) worldwide [26], and the same principles reported in this paper would apply to the development of such vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "Immunization with 1010 rAd particles of E71D(Z)+E71D(S/G) was effective against infectious challenge with ZEBOV. These data provide evidence that protection does not require the inclusion of the NP gene in the vaccine, and document that protective immunity can be conferred by responses to the GP antigen alone. Indeed, diminished survival was observed only in vaccine groups containing this gene, raising the possibility that under some conditions inclusion of NP may dilute protective immune responses. However, the significance of this result is limited by the relatively small animal numbers used here. It is noteworthy that elimination of NP from the vaccine and dose reductions to 1010 rAd particles do not diminish protection, and simplify the vaccine for future development in human trials. A first-generation Ebola DNA vaccine is currently under evaluation in phase I clinical studies, and the rAd component is currently being manufactured as a clinical grade preparation that is undergoing safety studies and will be tested in Phase I trials pending regulatory approvals. After the completion of initial studies testing individual DNA and rAd vaccine components, these candidates will be evaluated in prime boost combination. Vaccine safety and immunogenicity relative to the nonhuman primate challenge model will guide assessments regarding its utility as a preventive vaccine in humans.",
