Children are on average infected two to three times more frequently than adults. [2]. There are more than 200 respiratory viruses that can cause ARIs. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human enterovirus (EV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV), adenovirus (HAdV), and human bocavirus (HBoV) are the most common viral agents associated with ARIs, accounting for around 70% of ARIs [3, 4]. The frequency of mixed respiratory viral detection varies from 10% to 30% in hospitalized children [5\u20137]. In addition, several new human respiratory viruses have been described in recent years, including human metapneumovirus [8, 9], human bocavirus [10], and novel human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [11], human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) [12], and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2014CoV) [13].",

The age distribution of ARIs indicated that children under 3 years old were more likely to be infected by HRSV confirmed the importance of RSV in children with ARIs, especially in children < 4 years of age [36\u201339]. We observed a high rate of HRSV-detections in 2013\u20132014 (44.4%), while in 2016\u20132017 it was less than 10% which could be due to the annual variation in the circulation pattern of HRSV. Such year-to-year variation in the epidemiological patterns of viral infections confirms importance of the long-term study of the ARIs epidemiology [40].",

Finally, in our study, IFV (344/1560, 22.1%) was the second most frequent detected pathogen with markable seasonality in winter months. During the 2013\u20132014 epidemic season, influenza virus detection rate was low\u20146.9% of all respiratory viruses, which was in accordance with the official influenza surveillance results of Ministry of Health, Russia [42]. In our study in 2014\u20132015, influenza viruses were detected in 17.2% among all respiratory viruses. Among those, the percentage of influenza A virus accounted for 73.3% and influenza B virus made up 26.7% of all detected influenza viruses. At the same time, in Russia influenza B was the main etiological agent, accounting for 50.6% of all detected influenza viruses. In 2015\u20132016, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was predominant in Russia, accounting for 79% of all influenza-positive samples consistent with our results (82%). In 2016\u20132017 influenza A(H3N2) virus was dominant in Russia detected in 61.3% of all influenza virus cases [42]. In our study influenza A and B viruses were detected with approximately the same frequency (48% and 52% respectively).",

Co-infection is most often found in children under the age of 5, due to the immaturity of the immune system and, thus, greater susceptibility to infection [45]. In our study, we significantly more frequently detected cases of simultaneous infection with two or more viruses in children under 7 years of age compared with children of school age (12.2% versus 3.4%), while there was no significant difference in the incidence of viral co-infection between the age groups of 0\u20131 year, 1\u20133 years and 4\u20136 years.",
