The interaction between CoV spike (S) proteins and specific cellular receptors on host cell surfaces mediates viral attachment and fusion of viral and cellular membranes, playing a vital role in successful infection in the host22\u201324. The CoV S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with high molecular weight that protrudes from the surface of virions. The amino-terminal S1 domain is responsible for the recognition of cellular receptors, and the carboxy-terminal S2 domain mediates the subsequent membrane fusion process25. Recently, two research groups independently resolved the structure of PDCoV S protein by cryo-electron microscopy26, 27. PDCoV S protein is a trimer containing three receptor-binding S1 subunits and membrane-fusion S2 subunits27. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the PDCoV S1 subunit that is responsible for receptor binding shares a similar structural fold with alphacoronavirus.",

We found that ectopic expression of pAPN rendered non-susceptible cells susceptible to PDCoV infection and promoted PDCoV infection in poorly susceptible cells. However, pAPN knockout or treatment with APN-specific antibody and inhibitor only decreased PDCoV infection to some degree. Additionally, pAPN knockout in porcine intestinal epithelial (IPI-2I) cells, a cell line established from porcine ileum, did not completely block PDCoV infection but significantly affected viral replication. We also demonstrated that the APN enzymatic activity inhibitor did not disrupt PDCoV infection, indicating pAPN enzymatic activity is not involved in this process. Our work suggests pAPN is not a critical receptor but is an important factor during PDCoV infection.",

PDCoV S displayed higher homology with PEDV, PRCV, and TGEV (Fig. 1a). pAPN acts as a functional cellular receptor for TGEV and PRCV infection31, 35. Whether pAPN is indeed a functional receptor for PEDV remains controversial, but it is involved in PEDV infection36\u201338. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PDCoV S is close to the cluster containing PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV (Fig. 1b). Thus, we evaluated the role of pAPN in PDCoV infection.",

First, MTT assays and western blots were performed to detect the cytotoxicity of the three inhibitors and whether they affected the expression of endogenous APN in IPI-2I cells. Nearly no cytotoxicity could be detected (Fig. 4a), and APN expression was not affected in cells treated with any of the three inhibitors (Fig. 4b). Then, IFA and TCID50 assays were performed to analyze the roles of three inhibitors in PDCoV infection. The results of IFA showed that the numbers of PDCoV S-specific fluorescence-positive cells were reduced in 2,2\u2032-dipyridyl- and 1,10-phenanthroline-treated cells, but not in bestatin-treated cells, compared with control cells (Fig. 4c, d).

Isolated pAPN knockout IPI-2I (IPI-2I-APNKO) cell lines were further confirmed by sequencing and western blot analyses (Fig. 5b, c). Sequencing analysis demonstrated the alleles of the APN gene in the clonal cell line harbored a 5-nt deletion and a 1-nt insertion in exon 1 of the APN genome, resulting in the production of a truncated peptide with no function (Fig. 5b). Therefore, IPI-2I-APNKO cell lines were used to functionally assess the role of endogenous pAPN in PDCoV infection. Compared with wild-type IPI-2I cells (IPI-2I-APNWT), the viral titer in IPI-2I-APNKO cell lines was decreased by 1 log (Fig. 5d). We tested another isolated pAPN knockout cell line, IPI-2I-APNKO2, and similar results were observed (data not shown).

First, the internalization assay was conducted to analyze the earliest viral entry process. RT-qPCR and western blot showed that viral genome RNA copies and protein levels in IPI-2I-APNKO cells were both lower than those in IPI-2I-APNWT cells (Fig. 6a, b). To further detect the viral assembly or release, IPI-2I-APNKO and IPI-2I-APNWT cell lines were infected with PDCoV, respectively. At 24 h after infection, the cells and supernatants were separately collected for RT-qPCR and western blot. The ratios of the viral genome RNA copies and protein levels were almost identical between supernatant and cell lysates (Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that pAPN has no effect on viral assembly or release.

IPI-2I-APNWT and IPI-2I-APNKO cell lines were incubated with the same dose of TGEV or PDCoV. Cytopathic effects (CPEs) caused by PDCoV infection were observed in both IPI-2I-APNWT and IPI-2I-APNKO cells, even though IPI-2I-APNKO cells presented a mild CPE (Fig. 7a). However, loss of the APN gene in IPI-2I-APNKO cells led to the disappearance of CPEs in TGEV infection (Fig. 7a). PDCoV S protein and TGEV M protein levels in IPI-2I-APNWT and IPI-2I-APNKO cells were also analyzed by IFAs. As expected, PDCoV S-specific fluorescence in IPI-2I-APNKO cells was partially reduced (Fig. 7b), while TGEV M-specific fluorescence was undetectable (Fig. 7c). Similar results were demonstrated by western blot using antibodies against viral N proteins (Fig. 7d, e).

            "text": "To further explain the different roles of pAPN in PDCoV and TGEV, we compared the amino acid sequences of TGEV and PDCoV S1-CTD. Although the two proteins shared similar secondary structure elements, the N-terminus of PDCoV S1-CTD was shorter than that of TGEV, which led to a shorter turn of \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and of \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 in the PDCoV structure (Fig. 8a, b). Hence, the homologous model showed that S1-CTD of both PDCoV and TGEV adopted \u03b2-turns (\u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24), forming the tip of the \u03b2-barrel to recognize pAPN (Fig. 8c). For TGEV, residues in the two \u03b2-turns both contacted pAPN comfortably, forming a contact network (Fig. 8c). Conversely, only the top residues in the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 turn of PDCoV supported an interaction with pAPN, and the \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 turn failed to contact pAPN (Fig. 8c), indicating that its contribution to the interaction with pAPN is smaller than that of TGEV. Overall, the different lengths of the two \u03b2-turns (\u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24) between PDCoV and TGEV may determine their variability in pAPN usage during viral entry.",

            "text": "As an emerging swine enteropathogenic CoV and the sole member of the genus Deltacoronavirus that has been successfully isolated by cell culture in vitro, PDCoV is a good model to study deltacoronaviruses. However, very little is known about this emerging virus, including its receptor and infection mechanisms. A recent study showed that the \u03b2-sandwich core structure of PDCoV S1-CTD, which may be responsible for receptor recognition, is similar to that of alphacoronaviruses, which mainly use APN as a cellular receptor27. Furthermore, PDCoV in infected pigs was primarily detected in the villous epithelium of the mid-jejunum to ileum20. Large amounts of APN are also expressed on the surface of porcine small intestine enterocytes31. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of pAPN in PDCoV infection. Interestingly, ectopic expression of pAPN successfully reestablished PDCoV infection in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells, and pAPN overexpression effectively promoted PDCoV infection in poorly susceptible HeLa cells expressing pAPN. However, pAPN knockout in IPI-2I cells, a cell line that was established from porcine ileum and is highly susceptible to PDCoV infection, did not completely block PDCoV infection. We also performed pAPN knock-down experiments with pAPN-specific siRNA in LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney) cells, and the viral titers were decreased by only 0.6 log in pAPN-knock-down LLC-PK1 cells compared to the LLC-PK1 cells transfected with control siRNA (data not shown). A recent study found no interaction between purified pAPN and PDCoV S1-CTD by dot-blot assay27. Although we detected a possible weak interaction with the purified full-length PDCoV S protein and pAPN through molecular sieve analysis, a direct interaction could not be confirmed by pull-down assay (data not shown). In contrast, another CoV, TGEV, which uses pAPN as a functional receptor, failed to infect IPI-2I-APNKO cells, as demonstrated by CPE, viral protein expression, and viral genome replication. These results indicate that pAPN plays a decisive role in TGEV infection and only a contributing role in PDCoV infection in IPI-2I cells. Coincidentally, pAPN was initially identified as a PEDV-binding protein in swine kidney cells by virus overlay protein binding assay, and non-susceptible cell lines expressing pAPN became susceptible to PEDV40, 41. However, more recent evidence showed that pAPN knockout did not decrease PEDV infection, and no interaction between PEDV S1 and pAPN was detected, implying that pAPN is not a functional receptor for PEDV entry37. Thus, whether pAPN promotes PDCoV or PEDV infection through direct interaction with S protein or along with other cellular proteins requires further investigation.",

            "text": "CoV S proteins contribute to the first step of viral infection and seem to be a vital determinant of host range and tissue tropism. Considering that pAPN is a functional receptor for TGEV, but not for PDCoV, we analyzed differences between PDCoV and TGEV S protein structures. In general, S protein S1 subunits, which contain two independent, functional subdomains S1-NTD and S1-CTD, mediate viral entry into cells during CoV infection. Although MHV S1-NTD is reported to recognize sugar receptors and a unique protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 134, protein receptor recognition for most CoVs depends on S1-CTD46. In particular, APN receptor in several alphacoronaviruses, such as TGEV and PRCV, interacts with S1-CTD35. Understanding the differences between S1-CTD structures of various CoVs is helpful to explain the role of pAPN in viral infection. Therefore, we analyzed the possible recognition of pAPN by PDCoV and TGEV S1-CTD. We found that the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 turns in TGEV S1-CTD strongly supported its interaction with pAPN. However, for PDCoV S1-CTD, only residues at the top of the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 turn contacted pAPN. The markedly shorter \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 turns in PDCoV S1-CTD may cause insufficient contact with pAPN during viral attachment. These findings may help explain the limited role of pAPN in PDCoV infection. PDCoV can be detected in other tissues of infected pigs1, 4, 10, 47, suggesting that another, unidentified protein may contribute to the PDCoV recognition and entry processes. In addition, the S gene of CoV has been shaped by recombination and positive selection that may have led to changes in receptor-binding affinity48, 49. For example, isolated MERS-CoV strains from a recent outbreak in South Korea had point mutations in S1-CTD and showed decreased binding ability to the cellular receptor50. A highly neurotropic MHV JHMV strain infected host cells through a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 receptor-independent manner51. However, whether the evolution of PDCoV S1-CTD is responsible for the shorter \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 turns and impaired ability to use pAPN requires further investigation. Moreover, the receptor-binding region of CTD is believed to bear mainly epitopes recognized by CoV neutralizing antibodies35, 50, 52, 53. Thus, the receptor-binding regions of CoVs are under selective pressure from the host immune system. We speculate that the shorter \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24 turns in PDCoV S1-CTD compared with TGEV S1-CTD may be the result of positive immune pressure from the host. Conformational changes help PDCoV to evade host immune surveillance, while the ability of PDCoV to hijack pAPN may be impaired. These findings imply that a yet unidentified receptor may be utilized by PDCoV in the process of viral evolution and variation.",

We therefore evaluated the role of hAPN in PDCoV infection. PDCoV efficiently infected non-susceptible BHK-21 cells expressing hAPN by transient transfection, as demonstrated by detection of PDCoV S protein-specific fluorescence. However, TGEV failed to infect BHK-21 cells overexpressing hAPN (data not shown). These observations suggest that PDCoV may employ both pAPN and hAPN, while TGEV can only employ pAPN. In addition, a previous study suggested that calves are also susceptible to PDCoV infection54. Although no diarrhea or other clinical signs were observed in PDCoV-inoculated calves, persistent fecal viral RNA shedding and serum IgG antibody responses against PDCoV were detected54.

However, whether pAPN promotes PDCoV infection through direct interaction with PDCoV S protein or with the cooperation of other host proteins must be further elucidated. The findings of slight infection in HeLa cells and successful infection in non-susceptible BHK-21 cells expressing hAPN suggest that a possible co-receptor exists in both porcine and human cells, revealing the potential risk for PDCoV cross-species transmission. Therefore, detailed study focused on virus-host interactions and identification of critical functional receptor usage is necessary to increase the understanding of PDCoV infection.",
