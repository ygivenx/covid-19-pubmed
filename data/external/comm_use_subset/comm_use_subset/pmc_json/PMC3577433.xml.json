One genotype of CBoV was associated with respiratory disease as it showed higher prevalence in diseased animals than healthy controls\n[10].

The resulting sequences were aligned and the length of the region between the VP stop and the NS start codon calculated. This region varied in length from 392 to 506 nt (Figure \n2C). Mfold analyses of the longest NTR sequence (506 nt) showed that the long palindromic hairpin terminal repeats (e.g. approximately 150 nt at both ends in MVC or bovine parvovirus, BPV) were missing, but a typical \u201crabbit ear\u201d structure was detected that was nearly identical to a structure in the MVC 5'NTR sequence (Figure \n2B). These results suggested that inverse PCR may have been impeded by strong secondary DNA structures (Figure \n2A &C, between two red arrows). None of the currently reported NTR regions of bocavirus obtained by inverse PCR contained both complete inverted terminal repeats seen in MVC or BPV\n[18-20].",

The presence of three distinct canine bocaviruses, phylogenetically interspersed with viruses from different mammalian hosts, may reflect their origins from different cross-species transmissions. The detection of CnBoV3 in liver tissue indicated that the virus had likely breached the mucosal barrier of the typical sites of bocavirus replication in the respiratory or enteric tracts. The detection of episomal forms by PCR indicated that replication may be occurring in hepatocytes or other liver cell types and that viremia was also likely present although the lack of available blood sample prevented direct testing. We also detected in that animal co-infection with a canine circovirus. Circovirus infection can lead to lymphocytic depletion and immunosuppression in the host\n[22]. Whether CnBoV3, canine circovirus, or their combination were involved in this dog\u2019s severe symptoms requires further investigation.",

Necropsy showed the presence of necrotizing vasculitis, granulomatous lymphadenitis and anuric renal failure. Clinical and post-mortem tests for multiple infectious agents of enteric disease were all negative. Liver Tissue was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further processing. Tissue samples (~25 mg) were homogenized, filtered, and nuclease treated as previously described to enrich for nucleic acids within viral particles\n[23]. Nucleic acids were then extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), randomly amplified using random RT-PCR with randomized 3\u2019 primers and nucleic acid libraries prepared as previously described\n[24] for sequencing using the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument (454 Life Science, Roche). The pyrosequencing reads were sorted, trimmed, assembled and compared to the GenBank non-redundant databases as previously described\n[9]. Potential viral sequences were identified with translated protein sequence similarity matches (BLASTx to GenBank's NR database with E-value < 10-3) to known viral sequences. The presence of virus protein sequences detected by 454 pyrosequencing was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Genome walking and degenerate PCR were used to amplify the viral genome. Enriched viral nucleic acids from the infected tissue was also handled using the ScriptSeq RNA-Seq library preparation kit (Epicentre) and sequenced by MiSeq system (illumina). The resulting near complete genome of CnBoV3 was deposited in GenBank with accession no. KC580640. Phylogenetic analyses based on aligned amino acid sequences from full-length VP proteins were generated by the neighbor joining method in MEGA\n[25], using amino acid p-distances, with 1,000 bootstrap replicates.",
