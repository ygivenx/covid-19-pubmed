From 2009 to 2013, a total of 1046 hospitalized ALRI patients (children and adults) were treated at 12 sentinel hospitals in eastern China. We found that most patients had RSV single-infections and that 37.3% had mixed viral infections caused by RSV and other respiratory tract viruses. Additionally, we observed that coinfections with RSV and influenza were the most frequently diagnosed mixed infections among our patient population, a finding consistent with those of previous studies in China [17\u201321] and other countries [15, 22\u201326]. Taken together, these findings indicate that coinfections may influence severe illnesses in patients with RSV infections, especially in young children aged <5 years.",

In our study, only a few patients with RSV infections were treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs (Ribavirin and Potassium sodium dehydroandroandrographolide succinate) that were not specific for RSV. Most of the antimicrobial drugs administered to patients in this study were not appropriate for patients with RSV infection but are commonly used in such patients in China. It is well known that antimicrobial drug overuse selects for highly resistant organisms, causes immune dysfunction, and increases viral loads, which may explain the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with RSV infection [12, 26\u201328].",

RSV infection is common in young children, and implementing disease control strategies (such as safe vaccination) during the appropriate seasons may have a significant impact on public health. Clinical and laboratory data pertaining to patients with RSV infection may be helpful for optimizing patient treatments. Timely and accurate diagnosis of RSV infection in patients with ALRIs is necessary to prevent large-scale RSV spread and to reduce the burden imposed by the disease and the misuse of antimicrobial drugs. These preliminary results indicate that more surveillance data are needed to estimate the RSV disease burden and to determine whether geographic locations, climate, other environmental factors and RSV coinfections impact the severity ofRSV-related epidemics.",
