In particular, disease-control communities are nervous about the future of global efforts, which have drastically reduced the disease burden related to major infections and maternal and child health. In this paper, the author first reviews the environment surrounding health strategies and plans, as well as lessons learned from the first 15 years of global health in the 21st century. Then, the quest for a new paradigm of disease-control efforts and challenges and opportunities for Japan are discussed. The article is based on a keynote speech presented at the 2015 Global Health Workshop of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities (APRU), which was hosted by Osaka University, on October 30\u201331, 2015, in Osaka, Japan.",

Until recently, it was a common experience at riversides throughout Western Africa to see a child guiding an elderly person blinded by onchocerciasis. A statue depicting this scene has been erected in front of the World Health Organization (WHO) main building. The second good example celebrating the closure of the MDG is Professor Youyou Tu\u2019s receiving of the Prize for her discovery of artemisinin, a very powerful anti-malaria drug.

The target was to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 3/4 between 1990 and 2015. MDG 6 was to combat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, and other diseases. The targets were to halt their increase by 2015, begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, and begin to decrease the incidence of malaria and other diseases. The goals were therefore clear and few, and the targets were relatively quantitative. This simple framework was agreed on and invested in by everybody.",

A typical example is onchocerciasis, an indigenous parasitic disease which occurs at riversides, particularly in West Africa. In the past, this disease often led to the abandonment of rich riverside farmland. But now, after regular mass treatment, people can return to these farming areas and resume farming. According to a World Bank estimate, the recovered farmland is producing food for a population of 17 million. Hence, control of onchocerciasis has contributed to the alleviation of hunger through food production and income generation. Health contributes to other goals and vice versa. Other examples are water quality and gender equality, both of which have a positive synergy with health. Accordingly, the SDGs represent a unique environment within which all health strategies and plans are required to work for the next 15 years.",

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the G7 leaders felt it critical to address the root issues of terrorism by interrupting the vicious cycle of poverty and ill health. During this era, the number one disease burden for the working population in developing countries was HIV/AIDS, followed by tuberculosis. MDGs were already chosen, at the UN Assembly in 2000, and served as an excellent platform for attracting international commitments and resources to fight against poverty and ill health through investment in priority disease-control efforts. This led to the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund). Furthermore, two other important outcomes arose from the response to 9/11 which have shaped today\u2019s global health landscape. One is strengthening of health security, triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience in Asia in 2003. While 9/11 was physical terrorism, it is natural to be concerned about bio-terrorism as well. These combined concerns over terrorism and unusual new infections drove the world to drastically overhaul the quarantine system, resulting in the agreement of the International Health Regulations (IHR) public health treaty in 2005. Since then, all countries are requested to report unusual health events. Japan has reported a few incidents, such as the Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, and more recently, dengue fever in 2014. WHO receives some 300 reports annually and assesses each for its significance to global health. Major influence also came from the report of the National Academy of America: Making the Nation Safer,3 which shaped the health research agenda for health security.",

Chris Murray2 studied the growth of health ODA and found that it increased from some 5 billion United States Dollars (USD) in 1990 to 27 billion USD in 2010. It should be noted that the composition of providers for this health ODA is changing. Resources from bilateral donors grew after 9/11, but contributions from international organizations remained quite modest. In contrast, the largest growth was observed from the private sector and from new funding mechanisms, such as the Global Fund, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). The growing activities of non-state actors in global health are noteworthy. For example, the annual budgets of the BMGF and M\u00e9decins sans frontiers (MSF) are almost equal to the budget of WHO. Global health has evolved from the individual or philanthropic efforts of outstanding individuals and international organizations acting in this high-profile domain within international communities, and now represent a multi-polar field with many actors, particularly non-state actors.",

Specifically, AIDS-related mortality is down by 30% from its peak in 2005. Tuberculosis prevalence has fallen by 41%, and its mortality rate has fallen by 45% against the 1990 baseline. Malaria control is progressing. Four neglected tropical diseases\u2014human African trypanosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, blinding trachoma, and leprosy\u2014are on track to be eliminated as public health problems, and guinea worm disease is also progressing towards eradication. The reduction in child mortality has also been remarkable: compared to approximately 12 million child deaths in 1990, only 6 million children died last year. Eighty percent of African children receive the basic vaccine package of BCG, polio, and DPT. Tobacco is one of the most serious epidemics, and its control is critical to prevent lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

The adoption of this strategy carries much weight because it means that the health ministers of all 194 member countries agree with it. This is very important. This strategy defines who and how many to treat. Because the target set by the MDGs expired at the end of 2015, WHO started to produce new-generation strategies and plans aimed at the post-MDG era. A new strategy was adopted for tuberculosis in 2014 and for malaria in 2015. In 2016, a new strategy will be developed for HIV/AIDS. Strategy building is a resource-intensive process. WHO needs to consult with the member states, bring in scientific communities, and listen to civil societies. Informally, WHO has conversations with donors to determine whether they will financially support the proposed new strategy, in order that it be rendered a useful tool for affected countries, in terms of both resource mobilization and for the donors in terms of investment planning.",

            "text": "Figure 2 shows my view of the global health circle, taking the example of HIV/AIDS, which has functioned very well to date. First, we need global consensus. In the case of HIV/AIDS, the UN General Assembly adopted relevant resolutions in 2000 and 2010. If you recall the year 2000, HIV treatment had become standard in the northern hemisphere, but patients in the southern hemisphere were left behind because the drugs were very expensive. The standard regimen used in most Western countries cost about 10 000 USD per year. This treatment gap attracted attention from political leaders and was discussed at the Kyushu-Okinawa Summit in 2000. However, political will alone could not solve the practical bottleneck of the high cost of the standard treatment regimen. Practical technical guidelines that accounted for the availability of technology and other resources in developing countries were lacking. At that time, HIV testing was expensive and difficult, and WHO faced the challenge of diagnosing HIV without sophisticated tests and treating patients with a cost-effective combination of generic drugs. WHO\u2019s technical leadership was expected to overcome such challenges and see that the political commitments were successfully implemented in the field. This is a typical example of the norm/standard-setting function of WHO. Having established the norm and standard, we then need a global strategy to define how many patients to treat, how they should be treated, and when treatment should be initiated. Resources must then be mobilized to support the targeted disease-control efforts. Finally, monitoring is also very important, because sometimes resources are invested in the wrong place. For example, in many countries, the largest segment of health education on HIV still targets the general population, in which the likelihood of being affected by AIDS is relatively low. For different reasons, those who are at very high risk of HIV infection, such as sex workers, intravenous drug users, and the transgender population, are left behind. This is an important area where WHO and UNAIDS work in collaboration and blow whistles for public health authorities.",

As the name NTD implies, the populations most affected tend to be marginalized and voiceless.

The humanitarian gesture to help \u201cthe poorest among the poor\u201d attracted the corporate social responsibility arms of major pharmaceutical companies, resulting in drug donation programs.

In the case of hepatitis as a cause of hepatic cancer, linkage within the cycle is not complete, despite the clear consensus, expressed by the World Health Assembly Resolutions in 2010 and 2013, to expand hepatitis programs. The first challenge has been the development of guidelines for hepatitis C, because a new but highly expensive drug has come onto the market in high-income countries. For the Japanese market, one tablet costs about 500 USD, and patients need to take the tablets daily for 12 weeks. Whether to put this new drug in the guideline or to stick to the traditional interferon-based treatment regimen is controversial: everyone wishes to bring new drugs into the guideline, but if the treatment is not implementable, it will not be useful for practice. A second challenge is the development of a new global strategy for hepatitis, including treatment targets. Setting targets is difficult because the majority of heavily affected countries are middle-income countries, where ODA is not available. Hence, all resources should be mobilized domestically under the responsibility of national governments. Such responsibility will be scrutinized by monitoring organizations, which encourage governments to set targets low to avoid issues of government accountability. Linkage of technical components with financial realities is essential to any completion of this circle.",

In addition, since NCD are most common in countries not eligible to receive ODA, as in the case of hepatitis, crafting strategies and setting treatment targets are very challenging.

            "text": "While the SARS outbreak contributed to shaping global health policy in the last decade, the implications of the recent Ebola outbreak need to be explored. The statistics of the Ebola outbreak to date read nine countries infected, transmission across three continents, 26 000 cases, and 11 000 deaths, with the heaviest burden in three West African countries. Indeed, this is the largest Ebola epidemic but not the first. In previous outbreaks, patients were confined to remote villages, and the outbreak subsided after several dozen cases. However, this most recent outbreak was distinguished by the increased mobility within and between countries after the end of civil wars in some of the countries, and also the employment of many mobile workers by the booming mineral industry. These characteristics enhanced transmission into capital cities, where health infrastructure has not caught up with the growing population. WHO has been criticized for responding to the Ebola pandemic too late, handling it inefficiently, and coordinating poorly with other agencies. These shortcomings are partly the consequence of the shifting of priorities from communicable disease control to NCD control, which resulted in insufficient funding for the relevant programs. An independent review panel of WHO7 has identified the above issues and urged WHO to expedite reforms to better prepare for future epidemics. In addition, a high-level UN panel report and an Institute of Medicine report are coming soon. The major foci will be full implementation of IHR to detect signals of international health concerns, governance of response (including declaring global public health emergencies), as well as strengthening WHO\u2019s global health infrastructure to support all these activities. Here, governance specifically means accountability, division of labor, and funding, and will require additional discussion at high policy levels. A test case for this is the division of labor in developing funding mechanisms currently hosted by WHO and the World Bank for funding reactions to large-scale epidemics. The former is called the WHO Contingency Emergency Fund8 and the latter is termed Pandemic Emergency Facilities.9",

For Japan, the greatest challenge is aging. Beginning in 2010, we have witnessed a gradual decline in the Japanese population, together with a sharp increase in the ratio of persons over 65 years old, particularly those exceeding 75 years. Japan has a very large population of centenarians aged over 100 years. Keio University has studied a cohort of centenarians10 and monitored their health status changes to investigate factors contributing to and impeding longevity. Indeed, longevity poses many challenges, not only for public health, but also for other social aspects. For example, persons with cognitive impairment face difficulties in making rational decisions, which are a fundamental aspect of our society. If we look at the prospect of population aging, more than 30% of the Japanese population already exceeds 60 years of age.",

Such population aging is a global phenomenon, and not exclusive to Asia, Europe, and North America; Chile, for example, is also seeing remarkable aging of its population. In other words, aging is a common challenge for all APRU member countries. The Japanese experience of response to population aging can serve as a relevant case study for the world, Pacific Rim countries in particular. In the 1950s, the Japanese focus was on tuberculosis control. In 1952, 25% of the national medical expenditure was allocated to tuberculosis treatment, and 50% of all national hospital beds were occupied by TB patients. After a sharp decline in tuberculosis, Japan then transformed such service infrastructure to NCD control, particularly to the prevention and treatment of stroke. The Osaka University group,11 now headed by Professor Iso, has reported the evidence for public health interventions for stroke prevention and control. A second contribution from Japan could be our experience in policy development, as shown in Figure 4.12 Japan started to prepare for the growing elderly population from the 1970s. Our experience offers case studies of both success and failure. For example, free medical care for the elderly was introduced in 1973, triggered by a very populist governor. As governor of a big city with a small aging population, this politician thought that his policy was both affordable and sustainable. However, it soon became obvious that the free medical care program was very difficult to continue when the urban population aged and economic slowdown decreased tax revenue. Nevertheless, every politician who raised the possibility of discontinuing the program paid a great political cost at election time. The program was finally discontinued only after several elections.",
