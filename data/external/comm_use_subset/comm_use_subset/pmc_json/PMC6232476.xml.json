The major surface protein of IBV, S, is a type 1 glycoprotein which oligomerizes to form trimers (7) and is thought to be the main inducer of protective immunity (8\u201312). The S protein is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, the N-terminal subunit S1 (approximately 500 to 550 amino acids, 90 kDa) and the C-terminal subunit, S2 (630 amino acids, 84 kDa), which contains the transmembrane domain. The S1 subunit plays a critical role in binding to cellular receptors since it contains the receptor binding domain (13, 14), determines the virus serotype, and is responsible for the induction of neutralizing antibodies (14\u201316). Multiple studies have shown that recombinant S1 expressed in adenovirus and Newcastle disease virus vectors can induce a certain level of protection in specified-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens against challenge with wild-type virus (11, 17, 18).",

This system has many potential applications, such as to enhance our understanding of the role of individual genes in pathogenicity and to lead to a new generation of rationally designed live attenuated vaccines (20). Previous work using the reverse genetics approach demonstrated that replacement of the ectodomain of the S glycoprotein of the apathogenic IBV Beaudette strain with the same region from either of two pathogenic IBV strains, M41-CK or 4/91, resulted in two nonvirulent rIBVs, BeauR-M41(S) and BeauR-4/91(S), respectively. Notably, both rIBVs based on the BeauR backbone acquired the same cell tropism of that of the donor S, M41-CK or 4/91 (22, 23). Other work demonstrated that the Beaudette S2 subunit confers the unique ability of Beaudette to replicate in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, a continuous cell line licensed for vaccine production (24, 25). Vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) or BeauR-4/91(S) can confer protection against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity, reductions in clinical signs and viral load in the trachea at 5 days postchallenge (dpc), further demonstrating the dominant role of the S glycoprotein in inducing protective immunity (23, 26).",

Notably both rIBVs have the advantageous ability to replicate in Vero cells (26; E. Bickerton et al., unpublished data) due to the presence of the Beaudette S2 subunit. We report here on the first application of rIBV with a chimeric S gene to be used in a vaccination trial. The rIBV BeauR-M41(S2) was also investigated in order to elucidate the relevant roles of both subunits in protective immunity.

Vaccination with rIBV expressing homologous S1 and S2 subunits (i.e., full S gene) in the Beaudette backbone induced partial protection classified by the level of ciliary activity and presence of clinical signs following challenge with wild-type IBV. Comparison of in vitro growth characteristics shows that inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene in the rIBVs does not impede replication in vitro. However, our data show that despite the ability to induce a degree of virus-specific protective immunity, the rIBVs are hindered by limited in vivo replication and the attenuated BeauR backbone.",

Higher IBV-specific serum antibody titers compared to challenge-only controls shows that vaccination with chimeric rIBVs was able to prime the birds for challenge. Whether the lack of full protection against the loss of ciliary activity and clinical signs was due to the absence of a homologous S2 subunit or an incorrect folding of M41/QX (S1) and BeauR (S2)\u2014and therefore lower infectivity\u2014could not be answered in this study.

After vaccination, there was no loss of ciliary activity in the trachea, indicating the apathogenicity of the rIBVs (data not shown). Similar to trial 1, at 21 dpv the chickens were challenged with M41-CK. Clinical signs were observed until 7 dpc; BeauR-M41(S) was the only vaccinated group to show less prevalent clinical signs postchallenge compared to the M41-CK challenge control (Fig. 6A and B). There was little difference between the BeauR-M41(S1), BeauR-M41(S2), and M41-CK groups in terms of the presence and severity of clinical signs (Fig. 6A and B), but in the vaccinated groups clinical signs resolved more rapidly compared to the M41-CK controls. Ciliary activity was assessed at 4 dpc, and the level of protection afforded were assessed according to European Pharmacopeia standards (28). The BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group retained \u223c60% ciliary activity, showing an improved level of protection in comparison to groups vaccinated with BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-M41(S2), in which 20% protection in each group were evident (Table 2).

Although the titers of infectious challenge virus recovered from tracheas at 4 dpc were not significantly reduced in BeauR-M41(S)-, BeauR-M41(S1)-, and BeauR-M41(S2)-vaccinated chickens compared to controls (because of the variation within each group), there was a general trend that vaccination resulted in a reduction in viral infectivity, with no detected infectious virus recovered in four of five birds in the S group, three of five birds in the S1 group, and one of five birds in the S2 group (Fig. 7E).

Here, we extended this work and replaced only the S1 subunit of the ectodomain of BeauR with the S1 domain of M41 or QX, representing two strains that circulate in poultry flocks worldwide. These rIBVs have the advantage of being able to replicate in Vero cells, potentially allowing large-scale vaccine production in cell culture rather than in embryonated eggs. In this first vaccination study, using a single dose of BeauR-M41(S1) or BeauR-QX(S1) in 1-week-old chicks, the birds were not protected against homologous challenge based on ciliary activity and clinical signs. Vaccination with BeauR-QX(S1) induced significantly higher serum titers postchallenge, and the clinical signs associated with challenge virus, although present, decreased rapidly compared to unvaccinated birds challenged with QX. Together, these data show that vaccination with chimeric rIBVs are able to induce a degree of virus-specific immunity with partial local protection in the mucosal head tissues and the primary site of replication, the trachea.",

One-week-old birds were immunized once with BeauR-M41(S), BeauR-M41(S1), or BeauR-M41(S2). Replacement of the apathogenic BeauR-S1 or S2 subunits with a S1 or S2 from a pathogenic strain, allowed BeauR to remain apathogenic, suggesting that the S1 or S2 alone do not play a role in the pathogenicity of IBV. This further expands our previous work showing that spike switching of BeauR-S with M41-S had no effect on pathogenicity (23). Here, vaccination of chickens with a rIBV based on a BeauR backbone expressing a full S gene from the donor serotype enhanced the level of protection afforded against tracheal ciliostasis, with three of five birds classed as fully protected. However, when classified under European Pharmacopeia standards for assessment of IBV vaccines (28), at which 80% protection (at a group level) against ciliostasis is required, the BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group was only able to confer partial protection (\u223c60%) and therefore is still not satisfactory for the criteria used for the assessment of IBV vaccines for industrial application. Consistent with previously published work, we show that collectively as a group the chickens vaccinated via ocular-nasal routes with BeauR-M41(S) had \u223c60% ciliary activity remaining, a reduction in clinical signs, and viral load postchallenge (26). The protection seen at the trachea may potentially be improved with assessment of ciliostasis at a later time point, as Armesto et al. (23) reported that vaccination with BeauR-4/91(S) gave \u223c60% ciliary activity at 4 dpc, which then improved to 90 to 100% at 6 dpc. In trial 1 the viral RNA load in the trachea and CALT from the S1-vaccinated groups was reduced at 2 dpc, whereas in trial 2 all vaccinated groups had a clear significant reduction in viral RNA loads at 2 and 4 dpc in the trachea and CALT. The qPCR used here is designed to detect the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the genome (29), and it therefore may be detecting incomplete virions or challenge virus captured in the lumen of the trachea. To further support the viral RNA load data, infectious viral load recovered from the trachea in both trials 1 and 2 were lower in rIBV-vaccinated chickens, indicating a degree of local protection at the site of infection, which was not robust enough to completely protect against viral replication in vivo and the loss of ciliary activity.",

In the coronavirus replication cycle, the spike mediates the critical steps of receptor binding and membrane fusion. Upon binding of the S1 receptor binding domain to the host cell, an irreversible conformational switch to the postfusion state allows the S2 subunit to fuse viral and cellular membranes, facilitating entry of the viral genome and therefore downstream viral replication (32\u201334). Recently, the crystal structure of the prefusion spike from mouse hepatitis virus and human coronavirus (HKU1) were resolved, highlighting the critical role that the interaction between the trimers of S1 and S2 plays in stabilization of the prefusion conformation of spike (31, 32). Here, expression of a chimeric spike in a recombinant IBV backbone with the lack of a homologous S2 possibly resulted in conformational changes either within the S1 subunit or complete S protein, potentially affecting receptor binding and entry, but may have also altered immunogenic epitopes. The S2 subunits of BeauR shares 87 and 97% amino acid sequence similarities with QX and M41-CK, respectively, showing that there are only a few different amino acid residues between them. The interactions between S1 and S2 subunits are critical for the maintenance of conformation, recognition, and efficient fusion of the spike to host cells; it has been consistently shown that even a single amino acid change within the S2 subunit of coronavirus spikes may influence the secondary structure of the overall spike or the S1 subunit (35, 36).",

During embryo passages, however, the Beaudette strain may have acquired mutations which are likely to contribute to its lack of pathogenicity and restrict its in vivo tropism and replication. Replacement of the BeauR S1 or S2 with corresponding subunits from a pathogenic strain did not indicate a significant impairment of in vitro growth of the viruses in comparison to the BeauR virus, showing no indication that BeauR-M41(S1) and BeauR-M41(S2) were unable to enter the cells, fuse with cell membranes, or fail to replicate in vitro. Nevertheless, the lack of full protection afforded by BeauR rIBVs against wild-type challenge and the limited in vivo replication strongly suggest that attenuations have occurred in genes playing an essential role in replication and that these are negatively impacting its suitability as a vaccine vector. Development of an alternative, less-attenuated backbone for the expression of heterologous genes in rIBVs may promote the development of these live attenuated vaccines for the control of IBV.",

As discussed earlier, the BeauR backbone is impeded by poor in vivo replication, and the lack of protection shown against ciliostasis indicates that there is a poor level of local immunity induced in the trachea by vaccination with BeauR rIBVs. Cytotoxic responses can also play a key role in the early control of IBV, as indicated by previous studies showing NK cell activation (42), IBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell-lymphocyte (CTL) activity of splenocytes isolated from IBV-infected chickens (41), and higher CTL proportions in respiratory tissues following IBV infection (43). Cellular infiltrates in head-associated lymphoid tissues, as well as a reduction in viral load in the trachea and CALT, also imply that the rIBVs infected the chickens and suggests a possible role for the cell-mediated response. However, that we were unable to consistently detect the recombinant S1 viruses at 2 dpv raises possibilities that the viruses were either rapidly cleared from the tissues, replicate poorly at these sites of inoculation, or have limited replication in a few cells which are below detectable limits of the assays. In the BeauR-M41(S)-vaccinated group, more than 50% of the chickens were positive for vaccine virus, as assessed by RT-PCR, in the Harderian gland and nasal turbinates at 1 and 2 dpv, respectively. The primary site of IBV infection is thought to be the ciliated epithelium lining the trachea; however, following ocular-nasal vaccination, the virus has been detected in the nasal turbinates (44) and Harderian gland (45).",

There is also evidence of an impaired humoral response in young chicks with regard to IBV vaccination; vaccination of 1- and 7-day-old chicks showed a delay in both systemic and local IgA and IgG levels compared to vaccination of older chicks (14, 21, or 28 days old) (46).

This was characterized by a reduction in the viral load recovered from the trachea and CALT, cellular infiltrations at head mucosal and inoculation sites, higher serum antibody titers in vaccinated groups, and the induction of virus-neutralizing activity. Vaccination with BeauR-M41(S), despite expressing the homologous full S to attempt to overcome any issues with heterologous S1 and S2 subunits and suboptimal folding, only induce a partially protection against the loss of ciliary activity. Since the in vitro growth characteristics show that inclusion of a foreign S gene or a chimeric S gene in the rIBVs does not impede replication in vitro, perhaps the attenuated Beaudette backbone has hindered the in vivo replication of these rIBVs; thus, to improve protection, multiple vaccinations, or an alternative backbone may be required.",

To quantify infectious viral load in trachea, tissue-derived supernatant was titrated in TOCs. To determine whether infectious virus was present, 10-day-old SPF embryonated eggs were inoculated with 100 \u00b5l of allantoic fluid; then, at 24 to 48 hpi they were assessed for viral presence by RT-PCR using primers specific for the 3\u2032 UTR, as described previously (53). For quantification of viral load, qPCR was performed using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with primers and probes specific to the 5\u2032-UTR region, as described previously (29). Serial dilutions of M41 cDNA (generated from 1 \u00b5g of tRNA) were included to generate a standard curve, and the data, expressed in terms of the cycle threshold (CT) value, were normalized using the CT value of the 28S cDNA product for the same sample (54).",
