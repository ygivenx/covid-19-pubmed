The challenge is to simultaneously address the demand for detection and characterization of unusual or exotic pathogens, drug resistance, or virulence traits as appropriate, and meeting the requirement for health-care cost containment and financial efficiency. In this perspective, a number of high profile microbiology services consolidations have already taken place in the private sector over the last decade: (i) BioReference Laboratories, Inc., acquiring Edge BioServ (2013) and merging with OPKO Health (2016); (ii) Sonic Healthcare Limited acquiring CBLPath, Inc. (2010) and an additional ten such acquisitions (2010\u20132017) in Europe alone; (iii) LabCorp, Inc., with seven such acquisitions (2010\u20132017); Quest Diagnostics, Inc., with six such acquisitions (2010\u20132017); and others. It was expected that this trend of CML consolidation would expand to larger academic health-care providers, such as the Karolinska University Hospital merger in Stockholm (2005\u20132008); the Charit\u00e9 Hospitals mergers in Berlin (2003); or the multi-faceted mergers led by the Royal Free London and University College London Hospitals forming UCL Partners (UCLP, 2005 onward). Due to the projected cost efficiencies and anticipated health-care improvements, regional or local authorities support such consolidation initiatives often in partnership with the academic sector. The laboratory network of the Assistance Publique\u2014H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP) or the recent (2015) launch of the University Laboratory of Brussels (LHUB-ULB) are representative examples.",

However, the effectiveness of such interactions is highly dependent on the ability for a correct understanding and interpretation of the message. Regular telephone calls (anchored by less frequent face-to-face meetings) are still considered effective as they allow for immediacy and a two-way dialog and opinion exchange (22, 23). Clinicians often emphasize the input resulting from the physical presence of CMs on ward rounds as ensuring a strong professional interaction with staff and the understanding of new technological diagnostic options, emerging pathogens or drug resistance mechanisms and local epidemiological trends (24, 25). In terms of education, maintaining the physical presence of CM on satellite clinical sites contributes to the continuing education of staff at those sites. The validation of results from the satellite laboratory owing to a telemicrobiology system is a promising solution making it possible to maintain the physical presence of a microbiologist at distant sites and ensure the satellite lab functions efficiently (26). Nevertheless, telemicrobiology requires efficient communication between teams located in satellite and central labs and a reliable IT department to manage potential connectivity dysfunctions.",

This wide variation supports the argument that further consolidation in CMLs within Europe remains possible. Consolidation frequently results in the adoption of 24/7 working patterns and increased automation, while microbiological services increasingly integrate within wider laboratory services where infectious serology and now molecular testing are often processed by biochemists in a general core-laboratory (28). Consequently, clinical microbiology analysis progressively moves toward an organization relying on different analytical platforms operated independently from the discipline or type of pathogen considered. External linkage to allow collaboration and systematic referral of specimens for further characterization and data to national reference laboratories (NRLs) with a public health mandate is essential. Furthermore, communication and collaboration with food safety, water quality, and environmental laboratories are also playing an important role in a public health microbiology network at national level within the One Health context (29). The relationships between different laboratory structures constituent within a regional clinical microbiology network are summarized in Figure 1.",

Same-day, direct assays, including molecular assays for selected organisms, are performed as a matter of routine thus reducing time to obtain results (TTR) (31). A potential paradigm shift for core laboratories in the implementation of innovative technologies at high-throughput testing volumes is the widespread deployment of molecular diagnostics in both distal and centralized laboratories. Near-patient testing would include so-called 1- to 2-h \u201cplug-and-play\u201d nucleic acid amplification tests for which a rapid result can directly impact patient care. More-complex/high-volume tests would be dispatched to a core facility. An indicative list of tests that can be performed at peripheral CMLs is shown in Table S1 in Supplementary Material. However, each hospital presenting its own specificity, the stakeholder input in the processing priorities, definition of ideal turnaround times and adequate format of test result reports is central to the success of the consolidation process.",

Therefore, cost savings and efficiencies achieved in individual test volumes have a relatively small impact on the overall operating hospital budget. However, as laboratory tests are estimated to impact up to 60 to 70% of medical decisions the major impact of the CMLs consolidation will be indirect through the support of medical decisions both at an individual patient and public health level (33, 34). Such aspects are presented in the following section.",

Only a few studies have evaluated the true impact of rapid microbial identification (RMI) including direct DNA identification from positive blood cultures (36\u201338). For example, it has been demonstrated that most clinical changes involved treatment escalation in the general patient population and treatment de-escalation in the oncological patient population (39). In the pediatric population, RMI is particularly helpful in quickly confirming contamination by cutaneous bacteria. In some studies, it was shown that the delay in administering the modified treatment was high (>4 h in ap. 50% of cases), suggesting that communication between health professionals can improve further (39). These observations underline the different impact of the RMI across various hospitals, but also emphasize the important role of clinical pharmacists who can contribute to better coordination of care (40).",

In order to enable the efficient use of genomic typing technologies, laboratory-based surveillance will need to be linked even more closely with epidemiological data to better detect and monitor outbreaks and improve our understanding of epidemiological changes (45). This deep informational linkage relies upon an extensive system interoperability, where the availability of funds, staff skills, appropriate operational metrics, and management structures are often beyond the reach of individual institutions and require a collective approach. The conversion of health records into electronic form (Electronic Healthcare Records) and the developments of Big Data (General Practitioner records of individual patients\u2019 illnesses and treatments, and data from hospitals about patient attendances, diagnoses, and treatments) at national and EU levels represent new opportunities for facilitating public health efforts (46).",

A number of high profile translational research initiatives (100,000 Genomes Project, UK; the Precision Medicine Initiative, USA; and others globally) are meant to support the eventual technological transfer of high-throughput analytical approaches from research into the CML (52, 53). A characteristic example is the introduction of WGS capabilities into routine health care, which can now support a clinically relevant sample processing turnaround (54) and the high diagnostic granularity needed in complex clinical cases (55). The speed, size, and cost of the equipment has decreased, making the required upfront capital investment by health-care institutions feasible. At the same time, the decrease in the per base cost of sequencing has reduced by 92% from 0.52 to 0.04 USD per DNA Mb (National Human Genome Research Institute, January 2010\u2013January 2015) (56), supporting that operational cost savings can be used to offset the initial capital investment. However, a current bottleneck in the wider adoption of these initiatives is the data analysis and diagnostic interpretation processes which have to be certified, validated, and broadly accepted to be performed routinely and across centers. Consolidated laboratories may help to assess the clinical impact of such new advances by providing the accredited benchmark against which the new methods will be compared (57, 58). A similar approach can be taken for the \u201clab-on-a-chip\u201d methods (59).",

It would be particularly interesting to explore the impact of this new model on the wider quality and efficiency of health services, correlating with patient outcome metrics, such as length of hospital stay, mortality, and readmission rates. This broader health system view should include the impact on the clinical management in clinical fields that require significant laboratory input. This suggests the need for more complex studies, not just assessing assay performance for example, but rather entire process performances including the time, expertise and costs both of reporting results and of downstream clinical actions. Beyond the clinical care impact, CMLs also provide key information outputs for the protection of population health, which need to be assessed. In this perspective, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and microbiology experts designed and implemented the EULabCap monitoring system of national public health microbiology performance indicators toward ensuring sufficient capabilities at clinical and reference laboratory levels for well-informed infectious disease prevention and control actions (60).",

The inherent systemic flexibility that is necessary to receive different types of data at different speeds and from different locations\u2014and link all that to routinely collected clinical data and report back\u2014is not an insignificant task by itself. A number of questions are raised regarding the new pathways that might be necessary, the different regulatory approaches within Europe to handling this data under the EU personal data protection directives, and data quality issues (46). The ethical implications of big data analysis (BDA) have not been fully explored. In a recent review, Garattini et al. discussed the ethical implication of BDA in terms of loss of individual autonomy and erosion of freedom of choice in response to population-level benefits. If not correctly addressed by the inclusion of ethical design in the creation of big data, such ethical issues might become limiting factors preventing BDA from reaching its full potential (46). The significant role of the CML networks should not be underestimated in the sharing of routine clinical metadata or data collected. Their potential integration into a common data set (biorepositories\u2014as proposed by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) (61) would maximize the opportunities for patient contributions to be translated into therapeutic and diagnostic solutions. The consolidation process for example provides a tangible opportunity to extend the scope of pooled analyses of individual patient biomarker data from heterogeneous laboratory platforms and cohorts into population-level studies using merging algorithms (62). At a population level, CML networks can actively support ongoing surveillance, e.g., on AMR, and can add value by connecting some or all of these data (under appropriate management and regulatory structures) to national public health surveillance systems or international networks, such as EARS-Net or the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), recently launched by the World Health Organization (63, 64).",
