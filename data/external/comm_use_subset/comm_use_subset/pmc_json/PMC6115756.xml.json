            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes severe enteric diseases with a high mortality rate in suckling piglets [1]. For decades, pathogenic strains of PEDV have caused recurrent outbreaks with enormous economic losses worldwide. The 28-kb PEDV genome has a gene organization typical of an Alphacoronavirus, i.e., ORF 1a/b, spike (S), open reading frame 3 (ORF3), envelope (E), membrane (M) and the nucleocapsid (N) genes [2]. Although not entirely elucidated, it is assumed that PEDV replication is initiated by the interaction of the S protein to cellular receptors, followed by endocytosis-mediated viral internalization [3]. After the release of viral genomic RNA into the cytoplasm, replicase proteins undergo extensive intracellular membranes modification to promote viral RNA synthesis. Shortly after synthesis of structural proteins, nascent virions are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), before being released, via smooth-walled vesicles, by exocytosis. While the roles of structural proteins in coronavirus (CoV) replication have been extensively studied, the contribution of the accessory ORF3 protein, particularly in PEDV replication, remains quite elusive. Mounting evidence has suggested that ORF3 is one of the key determinants of PEDV virulence [4]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which it modulates viral pathogenicity are as yet clearly defined.",

The full-length ORF3 (675 nt; 224 aa) is found in wild-type PEDVs, while the truncated ORF3 (624 nt; 207 aa; 82\u201398 amino acid deletion) is common in cell-adapted or attenuated PEDVs [4]. Structurally, ORF3 has been predicted to harbor multiple transmembrane domains, existing as a tetrameric ion channel [5]. However, results from assays using cells stably expressing ORF3 revealed that the protein was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm [6]. Cells expressing ORF3 also displayed a prolonged S phase of the cell cycle and augmented vesicle formation [6]. These results altogether point to the possibility that ORF3 might not be a typical ion channel, but rather a multifunctional protein that is involved in many cellular processes. Notably, since cell culture-adapted variants of PEDV usually possess abortive ORF3, be it absent or truncated [4], it is also likely that ORF3 might interfere with PEDV replication in cultured cells [7].",

It is also difficult to assess ORF3 expression in virus-infected cells as specific antibodies are either not accessible or ineffective. In this study, we constructed recombinant PEDV bearing ORF3 with specific epitope tags and evaluated the ORF3 expression in infected cells in comparison to those transfected by the expression plasmid. We demonstrated that the expression of ORF3 in PEDV-infected cells is distinct from that transiently expressed in individual cells. Furthermore, we found that ORF3 and S are co-localized in several cellular compartments in infected cells and the ORF3-S interaction was also confirmed. Collectively, our results suggest that ORF3 may interact with S during PEDV assembly and consequently exert its activity at this step of virus replication.",

We thus attempted to generate recombinant PEDVAV12 carrying the codon-optimized ORF3-FL and-Trnc carrying myc-tag at the C-terminal as depicted in Figure 1A. The recombinant viruses, PEDVAV12_ORF3-FL and-Trnc, could be propagated in VeroE6-APN cells with massive syncytium formation (Figure 1B). To confirm the presence of the ORF3 gene, we isolated viral RNAs of each recombinant virus and verified the sequence. Notably, both viruses contained the expected ORF3-myc with up to two amino acid mutations detected in some variants of ORF3-Trnc protein (Figure S1). To test whether the additional myc-tag affected the viral growth, we compared the viral growth kinetics between the reverse genetics-derived PEDVAV12 encoding untagged ORF3 and myc-tagged ORF3. We found that both viruses could efficiently infect and induce massive syncytium formation in VeroE6-APN cells with titers obtained from cells infected with each virus exhibiting no statistical difference (Figure S2).",

However, the observed ORF3 protein bands expressed in transfected and infected cells appeared in different patterns. While the expressed ORF3s protein displayed a single band in transfected cells, additional bands were detected in infected cells (Figure 2B, Left panel). We surmised that the observed Western blot expression patterns of each ORF3 protein in infected cells are distinct and might not be relevant to other viral proteins and the PEDV growth as indicated by no correlation between the amount of S and ORF3s proteins in infected cells (Figure S3). Further analysis by immunofluorescence assay also revealed that the ORF3 proteins are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of transfected and infected cells (Figure 2A,B).",

Interestingly, the ORF3 protein was expected to be in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; 44%), Golgi apparatus (Golgi; 11%) and vesicle of the secretory pathway (11%). To assess the subcellular localization of the ORF3 protein in ER and Golgi, we performed confocal immunofluorescence staining of cells transiently expressing ORF3 or PEDV-infected cells. Investigation at a lower magnification was also performed to present a syncytium boundary in infected cells (Figures S4 and S5). Analysis of co-localization of ORF3 proteins demonstrated that the ORF3-FL and-Trnc are partially localized in the ER (Figure 3) and Golgi (Figure 4) with no statistical difference of PCC values between groups (PCC \u00b1 SD; ER: ORF3-FL = 0.48 \u00b1 0.20, ORF3-Trnc = 0.76 \u00b1 0.11 and Golgi: ORF3-FL = 0.44 \u00b1 0.14, ORF3-Trnc = 0.51 \u00b1 0.15, Figure S6). However, there was a significant decrease in co-localization of ORF3-FL with the ER and Golgi markers as compared to those from ORF3-Trnc in infected cells (PCC \u00b1 SD; ER: ORF3-FL = 0.12 \u00b1 0.07, ORF3-Trnc = 0.46 \u00b1 0.12 and Golgi: ORF3-FL = 0.27 \u00b1 0.09, ORF3-Trnc = 0.65 \u00b1 0.05, Figure S6), suggesting a distinct biological characteristics of the ORF3 variants during virus infection. Notably, we tested that localizations of ORF3 in the ER and Golgi compartments are not due to the extra C-terminal myc-tag by replacing the myc with Flag tag at the C-terminal region. The results showed that Flag-tagged ORF3 protein was also similarly localized in the ER and Golgi (Figure S7).",

Likewise, a similar pattern was noted in the context of infection as vesicle-like compartments containing SAV12, and ORF3 proteins could be detected (Figure 6). Additionally, co-localization of ORF3-Trnc with SAV12 was more concentrated and localized together in the vesicles (Figure 6) at a higher PCC value than the ORF3-FL in infected cells (PCC \u00b1 SD; ORF3-FL = 0.24 \u00b1 0.07, ORF3-Trnc = 0.53 \u00b1 0.04), Figure S6). Of note, mean PCCs to assess ORF3-S localization are shown in Table S2. To further determine whether ORF3 could be co-localized with the S protein derived from other PEDV strains, we overexpressed ORF3 together with the S protein from field-isolated PEDV in G2b genogroup (S-G2), which is substantially distinct from the G1 genogroup like SAV12 [13,14]. Similarly, ORF3 was found co-localized with S-G2 in the same manner as those observed in SAV12 (Figure S9).",

It is thus possible that these proteins may share common functions. Our results in this study, however, suggest that ORF3 may play multiple roles in addition to being ion channels during replication of PEDV in host cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study has demonstrated that ORF3 in cells stably expressing the protein was predominantly cytosolic [6]. In addition, cells expressing ORF3 exhibited a prolonged S phase, suggesting that ORF3 may be associated with the host\u2019s cell cycle machinery [6]. Furthermore, our findings that the ORF3 protein expressed in transfected and infected cells displayed different patterns led us to speculate that the additional band in infected cells might be due to post-translational modifications that occurred during protein trafficking through the ER-Golgi compartments [15]. Indeed, the in silico analysis of ORF3 by the WoLFPSORT program predicts its cellular localization in ER, Golgi apparatus, and vesicle of the secretory pathway, which is confirmed by our immunofluorescence data. These results are actually in line with what reported previously about ORF3 [6,7] and other coronaviruses [16,17].",

            "text": "Our observation that ORF3 and S are both expressed on the cell surface points to the possibility that these two proteins might interact with each other. Indeed, we showed that both ORF3-FL and-Trnc proteins were co-localized with the S protein. Interestingly, ORF3-Trnc displayed a more apparent association with the S protein particularly at the perinuclear membrane of transfected cells and the vesicle-like compartments in infected cells. Ultrastructural characterization in PEDV infected cells has revealed that the PEDV virus replication site was mainly at the perinuclear space where maturation of the virus particles was formed and packaged into the vacuoles through the vesicular pathway in the ER and Golgi compartments [21]. The fact that ORF3 were found co-localized with S protein at the perinuclear area and in the vesicular structures may suggest its contribution at this step of the replication cycle. It is also notable that other accessory proteins from other coronaviruses have been shown to interact with viral structural proteins such as S, M, and E proteins [15,16,20]. In addition, recent evidence has suggested a possible association between S and ORF3 to increase virus replication and virulence in nursing piglets. Recombinant PEDV viruses lacking ORF3 were of very low virulence despite the expression of S derived from a highly pathogenic variant. Interestingly, when the functional ORF3 was restored, the recombinant viruses bearing S from the pathogenic strain and ORF3 displayed increased virulence [22]. These data, therefore, suggest that S and ORF3 may work in concert to regulate PEDV replication in vivo.",

It is noteworthy that while some variants of full-length ORF3 were shown to inhibit PEDV replication [8], some studies report that the protein could promote PEDV replication in vitro [5,6]. In this regard, we cannot definitively distinguish whether ORF3 functions in promoting or suppressing PEDV replication or what other viral proteins could contribute to the regulatory role of ORF3. Consequently, further work is required to determine precisely how ORF3 exerts its functions. Understanding these functions may, in turn, enable the development of new attenuated vaccines to prevent PED.",
