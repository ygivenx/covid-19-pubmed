However, multiple methods have been established to detect PRRSV specific antibody as a serological marker for PRRSV infection, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and immunofluorescence and immunochromatographic strip-based assays [4\u20139]. Generally, PRRSV-specific Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) appear typically after 28 days post-inoculation (dpi) [1, 10], but non-protective antibodies produced within the first week post-infection may be more useful for early detection of PRRSV infection. These early antibodies include non-neutralizing antibodies specific for structural proteins such as PRRSV N protein or nsps [1, 11]; N protein and certain nonstructural proteins (nsp1, nsp2 and nsp7) have been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic [12, 13]. Indeed, most currently available commercial ELISA kits that detect PRRSV-specific antibodies (e.g., IDEXX HerdChek PRRS ELISA) employ anti-N antibody as a serological marker for PRRSV infection or Modified Live Virus (MLV) immunization status [1].",

            "text": "Although commercial tests such as ELISA are highly sensitive for determining the presence of PRRSV-specific antibodies in serum samples, ELISAs are not suitable for quantitative analysis of antibody levels. This shortcoming is due to the fact that OD values obtained from ELISAs usually vary within a narrow range (from 0.1 to 2). Moreover, most ELISA kits use prokaryotically expressed single recombinant PRRSV structural antigens (generally PRRSV-N protein) as coating antigens. Consequently, such systems cannot evaluate PRRSV-specific antibody responses against other PRRSV enveloped proteins or nonstructural proteins (nsps). It should be noted here that systems employing multiple PRRSV antigens will probably not be developed due to the tremendous effort required for expression and purification of multiple ELISA plate coating antigens. Moreover, due to the general nature of ELISA coating antigens expressed in E. coli, false positive or false negative results have been frequently reported [12, 14]. Therefore, development of an improved method for both accurate detection and quantification of PRRSV specific antibodies is urgently needed.",

Briefly, the LACA detects PRRSV-specific antibodies in pig serum samples using mammalian cell-expressed recombinant PRRSV protein antigens (N and nsp1\u03b1) fused with Rellina luciferase. Similar to LIPS, LACA utilizes the enzymatic activity from captured luciferase-fused antigen-antibody complexes to convert a substrate to luminescent form to quantify antibody levels indirectly [15, 16]. As an immunoprecipitation assay, LIPS was originally developed by Dr. Peter D. Burbelo from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). LIPS utilizes luciferase-fused antigen and has been used for detection of antigen-specific antibodies or autoantibodies resulting from infection or autoimmune disease, respectively [18\u201320].",

To perform this comparison, a total of 107 PRRSV-positive (as defined by IDEXX ELISA) field serum samples collected from pigs from various farms were further tested by both LACA assays along with IFA verification. Among these field samples, an IDEXX ELISA-positive serum sample was found to be negative using both IFA and LACA (both N and nsp1\u03b1), suggesting a false-positive result for this sample based on IDEXX ELISA. In comparison with the results from IFA, 102 of 106 (96.2%) IFA-positive samples were defined as anti-PRRSV antibody-positive by N-Rluc LACA, while 101 of 106 IFA-positive samples (95.3%) were defined as positive by nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA (Table 5).

There is another assay utilizing luciferase-linked antigen for antibody detection, the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) assay [16]. LIPS uses immobilized Protein A/Protein G beads to pull down antigen-antibody complexes for antigen-specific antibody detection and quantification [15, 16, 28]. It has been widely used for pathogen-specific antibody detection including swine pathogen porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) [29], as well as for auto-antibody profiling of autoimmune disease patients [20, 30\u201332]. However, compared to LACA, there are certain disadvantages for LIPS while both assays employ luciferase-fused antigen and luminance signal from luciferase substrate for indirect detection and quantification of antigen-specific antibodies. On the one hand, the LIPS assay requires skilled technicians to conducted complicated immunoprecipitation (IP) procedures. On the other hand, LIPS requires immobilized protein G or A beads (agarose or magnetic beads conjugated to Protein G or A) which are less cost-effective for large scale screening beyond academic research.",

However, the two types of assay differ in reporter enzymes used (HRP for ELISA, luciferase for LACA), substrates (TMB for ELISA, luciferin for LACA), antigens (plate-coated antigen for ELISA, cell lysates for LACA) and opacity of plates (transparent for ELISA, black for LACA). Advantages of LACA over ELISA include the fact that luciferase-linked viral antigens used in LACA can be directly obtained from lysates of plasmid-transfected cells without requiring purification procedures [33\u201336]. Moreover, luciferase activity in LACA generates highly quantitative data spanning a relatively wider range of values (from 103 to 106) than for ELISA, which is more suitable for evaluating dynamic changes in antibody responses against a specific antigen over time.",

In our study, the PRRSV-specific antibody response could be measured as early as 3 dpi by N-Rluc LACA, but not by IDEXX ELISA for the same panel of sequential serum samples. These results therefore indicate greater analytical sensitivity of the LACA than of ELISA, perhaps due to LACA detection of swine anti-N IgM; because no N-specific IgG would be expected to be produced by 3 dpi, it is possible that the Protein G coating used in the LACA could capture N-specific IgM or other N-specific antibody types from swine sera. Nevertheless, the maximal level of antibody detected at 14 dpi by N-Rluc LACA was quite similar to that analyzed by IDEXX ELISA. As noted a decade ago, humoral immune responses against PRRSV infection are not restricted to PRRSV structural proteins, since antibodies recognizing nsps were detected as early as one week after PRRSV infection [1] with certain nonstructural proteins (nsp1, nsp2 and nsp7) highly immunogenic [13]. Since nsp1\u03b1 is both the first nsp produced post-infection and the first viral protein synthesized during PRRSV replication in cells, we also tested Renilla luciferase-fused nsp1\u03b1 as an alternative antigen for LACA. Based on our results, the earliest detection of PRRSV-specific antibody was observed at 10 dpi for nsp1\u03b1-Rluc LACA, with a longer duration of antibody detection that peaked at 21 dpi and remained high at 28 dpi (the end time point of the experiment).",

On the one hand, since the luciferase-fused PRRSV antigens used in this study (both N and nsp1\u03b1) were each derived from a single PRRSV strain (SD16 for N and HuN4 for nsp1\u03b1), it is possible that PRRSV strains circulating within the swine herd possessed corresponding proteins with different antigenic determinants, resulting in false negative results. Moreover, only 125 confirmed positive and 122 confirmed negative serum samples were used to validate the LACA assay, a limited sample size. Therefore, systematic screening for luciferase-fused PRRSV antigen or a combination of different PRRSV antigens may significantly improve LACA sensitivity.",
