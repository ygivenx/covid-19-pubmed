            "text": "In the global eradication program for poliomyelitis, the laboratory diagnosis plays a critical role by isolating poliovirus (PV) from the stool samples of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. The isolation procedure of PV have been established based on the cell culture system using a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD cells) and a mouse L cell line expressing PV receptor (L20B cells) [1,2]. The advantages of cell culture-based procedure are; 1) apparatuses for molecular diagnosis are not required, and 2) a high sensitivity (detection limit of 1 infectious dose that contains 50 to 1,000 virions in picornavirus infection) [3]. The disadvantage is that some expertise and quality control system are required for the cell culture system and for the identification of the cytopathic effect of infected cells. As for the timeliness of reporting, the cell culture-based procedure is time-consuming. It takes for 10 days to confirm the sample as PV-negative even after the introduction of the latest procedure \"New Algorism\" recommended by WHO [2]. Currently, detection of the circulating vaccine-derived PV (cVDPV) has a high priority in the eradication program and will be in the post-eradication era. Therefore, rapid (at the order of day) and sensitive detection of PV in laboratory diagnosis could contribute to shortening of the timeliness of reporting for mop-up vaccine campaign to control cVDPV outbreaks.",

PV-like 5'NTR is observed for enteroviruses belonging to Human enterovirus species C (HEV-C) and HEV-D, and CBV-like 5'NTR is observed for those belonging to HEV-A and HEV-B, respectively [11]. Therefore, we designed the primer sets to detect PV-like 5'NTR according to conditions required for the primer in RT-LAMP reaction in terms of the location and Tm values of the primers http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/lamp/primer.html (Figure 1b). Among the 5 primers used in the RT-LAMP reaction, 2 primers were preferable (a complete match for PV-like 5'NTR near the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in RT-LAMP reaction, FIP primer) or specific (a complete match for PV-like 5'NTR at the 3' end of the DNA fragment generated in RT-LAMP reaction, BIP primer) to PV-like 5'NTR (Figure 2). Other 3 primers (F, B, Loop B primers) were designed with conserved sequences between PV-like and CBV-like 5'NTRs.",

            "text": "In the primers examined in this study, the specificity to PV-like 5'NTR was defined by 2 primers (FIP and BIP primers, Figure 2). The sequences of primers we used might detect most of the cVDPVs or immunodeficient VDPVs, which were circulating or infecting for about 2 to 10 years [14-16] (Figure 5). However, one cVDPV strain (EGY88-074), which was isolated in an early stage of the circulation in Egypt with its 5'NTR that was probably derived from other enterovirus genomes by recombination [14], contained a different nucleotide at the 3' end of F primer. This nucleotide change was not observed for another cVDPV strain (EGY93-034), which was isolated in the late stage of the circulation, suggesting that this nucleotide change was not stable during the circulation. Therefore, some cVDPV isolates with this rare mutation might not be detected with the primer set examined in this study.",

However, detection of enteroviruses from stool samples showed only slightly lower positive rates for HEV-A and HEV-B (100 and 52%, respectively) compared to those for PV and other HEV-C (94 and 93%, respectively) (Figure 3d). The relatively low positive rates of HEV-B among these virus species might depend on the designed specificity of RT-LAMP to PV-like 5'NTR. Sequence analysis of 5'NTR of HEV-B isolates indicated that these field isolates could have some genetic features similar to PV-like 5'NTR (Figure 4). Therefore, with relatively low specificity of RT-LAMP system (100-fold difference between PV-like and CBV-like 5'NTR), the mixed genetic features of the 5'NTR of HEV-B field isolates might have affected the specificity of the RT-LAMP system.",

            "text": "An essential factor of the sensitivity of RT-LAMP system for the detection of PV from stool extracts seems to be the amount of viral RNA available for the reaction in addition to the quality of the RNA. We found one stool sample (CAM2553) was negative by the RT-LAMP among the 16 stool extract that was positive for PV by cell culture (Figure 3d). The 5' NTR of the PV2(CAM2553) did not have any nucleotide changes from that of its parental PV2(Sabin) strain (Figure 4). It is plausible that the low amount of viral RNA in the sample caused this false-negative result under the detection limit of RT-LAMP. The amounts of PV in the stool extracts were not generally high (< 100.5 to 102.5 CCID50/50 \u03bcl, Table 1). In the RT-LAMP reaction examined in this study, we purified viral RNA from 200 \u03bcl of stool extract and collected in 50 \u03bcl of elusion buffer (4-fold concentration by this procedure), and then 2.5 \u03bcl of this purified viral RNA solution was used for RT-LAMP reaction. Therefore, the net amount of viral RNA used in RT-LAMP reaction corresponds to that contained in 10 \u03bcl of stool extract. For the isolation of PV, 200 \u03bcl of stool extract is inoculated into the cells. Therefore, there is 20-fold difference in the available viral RNA or the infectious units between the RT-LAMP system and the cell culture system because of the intrinsic difference of the scale of the assay (12.5 \u03bcl vs. 1.0 ml). Because of a high particle-to-infective-unit ratio of PV, which was estimated as 56 to 153 copies of viral genome per CCID50 in this study (Figure 3c), relatively high sensitivity was attained in RT-LAMP system almost comparable to that of cell culture-based isolation. It should be noted that the sensitivity of this RT-LAMP system (< 400 copies) was not high compared to those of optimized RT-LAMP systems (1-100 copies), and was lower than that of a conventional real-time PCR system [17] (< 10 copies). Additional procedures to increase the concentration of viral RNA and to improve the quality of RNA would be helpful to improve the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP system for the detection of PV from stool extracts.",
