Epidemiological studies have shown that the virus has a worldwide distribution, whereby at least two distinct genetic lineages are cocirculating and reassorting [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Because of the high seroprevalence, cattle is the proposed natural reservoir of IDV, in which IDV causes mild respiratory disease symptoms [11]. In addition to cattle, IDV-specific antibodies have been detected in swine, feral swine, equine, ovine, caprine and camelid species, suggesting a broad host tropism for IDV [3,4,9,12,13,14]. However, the most striking observation is the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational exposure to livestock [15].",

For instance, the utilization of the 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a receptor determinant, that allows the hemagglutinin esterase fusion (HEF) glycoprotein of IDV to bind the luminal surface of the human respiratory epithelium [16]. Interestingly, the utilization of this receptor is also described for the closely related Influenza C virus (ICV) [17]. Furthermore, the detection of IDV-directed antibodies among humans with occupational exposure to livestock and the molecular detection of IDV in a nasopharyngeal wash of a field worker with close contact to livestock indicates that cross species transmission occurs [15,18]. However, thus far, there is no indication of wide spread prevalence among the general population although the virus has been detected during molecular surveillance of aerosols collected at an international airport [19,20]. Therefore, it remains unclear whether IDV can indeed infect cells within the human respiratory tract and, thus, whether it has a zoonotic potential.",

In addition, we sequentially passaged IDV further on na\u00efve well-differentiated hAEC cultures to determine whether infectious progeny virus is produced. This revealed that IDV is able to efficiently replicate in well-differentiated hAEC cultures and can be passaged subsequently without extensive genetic adaptations. Moreover, due to the similarity of IDV with ICV, we compared their viral kinetics and cell tropism. This showed that IDV has higher replication kinetics compared to ICV, and that both viruses share a cell tropism preference towards ciliated cells. These results emphasize that there is no fundamental restriction of IDV replication within the human respiratory epithelium. Therefore, these findings might explain why IDV-specific antibodies can be detected in humans with occupational exposure to livestock.",

Two microliters of RNA was used as templates to amplify of each of the 7 individual genomic segments with segment specific primers (Table 1) using Superscript IV one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to manufacturer guidelines. For each sample the amplified segments were pooled together at equal molar concentrations in order to reach a uniform sequencing depth for each individual genomic segment. The sequencing libraries of the pooled amplified segments were prepared using the Nextera XT library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina platform using 300 bp paired-end reads, according to manufactures protocol. The raw MiSeq Illumina reads were first trimmed using Trim Galore! (version 0.4.5) and then FastQC (version 0.11.7) was used to assess the overall read quality [32]. Trimmed reads from the inoculum virus sample were then aligned against the D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 reference sequence (GenBank: KF425659\u2013KF425665) using the Bowtie2 aligner (version 2.3.4.1) and Samtools (version 1.8) was used to generate a consensus sequence from this alignment [33,34].

To analyze temperature dependent effects, incubation of the cultures was performed at temperatures that correspond with those of the human upper and lower respiratory tract, 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C respectively. The release of viral progeny from the apical washes was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR for viral transcripts and virus titration for an infectious virus. The first viral transcripts were detected at 24 h post-infection (hpi) among all donors, independently of the incubation temperature (Figure 1A,B). However, some temperature-dependent differences were observed when the infectivity of the progeny virus was analyzed. When incubated at 33 \u00b0C, viral titers were detected for every donor at 48 and 72 hpi, but only one donor shows a viral titer at 24 hpi (Figure 1C). In contrast, we observed viral titers as early as 24 hpi for IDV infection at 37\u00b0C for every donor that increased over time (Figure 1D). These results suggest that IDV kinetics seems to be more efficient at ambient temperatures corresponding to the human lower respiratory tract, although the differences between the viral titers at 72 hpi are minor.",

However, commercial antibodies against IDV are currently unavailable, so we ordered a custom generated antibody directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) of the prototypic D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 strain. After securing the NP-antibody specificity (Figure S1), the microscopic analysis of IDV-infected hAEC cultures revealed clusters of NP-positive cells at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C, whereas no fluorescence signal was observed in the control hAEC cultures (Figure 1E\u2013H). The majority of the fluorescence signal from the NP-positive cells has a cytoplasmic distribution pattern, but some of those also appeared to have a nuclear staining pattern. These findings suggest that, like other Orthomyxoviruses, the NP of IDV is actively translocated to the nucleus during viral replication [37,38].

After 48 hpi, we collected the apical wash of P2 and made a 10-fold diluted that was sub-passaged upon na\u00efve hAEC cultures of the same donor (P3). As before, we performed these experiments at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C to assess whether there are temperature dependent effects. We monitored the production of viral progeny at 48 and 96 hpi for each of the passages. In the first passage (P2), viral RNA was detected at 48 hpi and increased with one order of magnitude at 96 hpi (Figure 1I). However, we observed that the viral RNA yield at 37 \u00b0C was approximately one order lower in the first round compared to the viral RNA yield at 33 \u00b0C, while at 96 hpi this difference slightly reduced. Interestingly, no difference between the different incubation temperatures was observed in the final passage (P3) (Figure 1J). Also, no pronounced differences were observed in the viral titers between the different temperatures or passage numbers at 96 hpi (Figure 1J). However, at 48 hpi, we only detect infectious virus in the apical wash from the last passaging experiment that was performed at 37 \u00b0C (P3; Figure 1J). These results show that the viral progeny from the initial experiments on well-differentiated hAEC cultures is infectious and that IDV can be serial-passaged on hAEC cultures from different donors at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C.",

            "text": "Because cattle are considered to be the main reservoir for IDV, we wondered whether any genetic changes might have occurred during the serial-passaging experiment of IDV on well-differentiated hAEC cultures. Since host adaptations usually arise after a few generations, we chose to only sequence the complete genome of the parental inoculum and the viruses that were obtained after 3 serial-passages at 33 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C. In total, we detected 33 different nucleotide variants among the different samples (Figure 2 and Table 2). Interestingly, these nucleotide variants were only detected in 6 of the 7 genomic segments. No nucleotide variants were detected for the genomic segment encoding for the NS1 and NS2 proteins. For our parental inoculum virus, we detected 11 nucleotide variants that were distinct from the D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 reference sequence that is deposited in Genbank (Figure 2 and Table 2). To assess for possible host and/or temperature-dependent adaptations in the passage 3 viruses we only considered nucleotide variants that were represented in viruses obtained from at least 2 different donors for each incubation temperature. This revealed that within the coding sequence for the HEF protein the frequency of the non-synonymous variant N249S at nucleotide position 770 seems to become more prevalent in the viruses that were three times serial-passaged in well-differentiated hAEC cultures (Table 2). This seems to have occurred independently from the temperature at which the viruses were propagated (Table 2). Interestingly, at nucleotide position 841 in the HEF gene segment we detected two genetic variants in the parental inoculum virus, which leads respectively to a non- or synonymous variant V273I and V273V (Table 2). The non-synonymous V273I variant has the highest prevalence, however it is absent among four of the six passaged virus isolates. Indicating that these isolates have reverted back to the corresponding D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 reference sequence in Genbank (Table 2), whereas among the two remaining virus isolates the synonymous V273V variant dominates (Figure 2 and Table 2). This shows that in humans, as well as all of the current known isolates from cattle and swine, the valine amino acid at position 273 is favored over an isoleucine. In contrast to these changes, we observed only one non-synonymous change at position N249S that seems to be a potential adaptation of IDV to well-differentiated hAEC cultures (Figure 2 and Table 2). Although, to what extent this non-synonymous N249S variant influences the replication kinetics of IDV on well-differentiated hAEC cultures remains to be addressed. Nonetheless, the deep sequencing results highlight that despite multiple passages there is most likely minimal adaptation required for IDV to replicate efficiently in the human respiratory epithelium.",

            "text": "Influenza C virus is a well-known common cold virus that is able to cause a mild upper respiratory tract infection in humans [39,40]. Because of this property and the structural similarity between the HEF of IDV and ICV, we wondered how IDV replication efficiency relates to ICV in our well-differentiated hAEC cultures [16]. To address this question, we first sought to limit any potential experimental variance between the readout of the viral titers. This was done by calibrating the virus stock production and viral titration of ICV (C/Johannesburg/1/66) and IDV (D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013) on a single cell line, namely HRT-18G. For the direct comparison of both viruses we inoculated well-differentiated hAEC cultures of two human donors with 10,000 TCID50 of ICV or IDV and incubated the cultures at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. This was done to determine whether there are any temperature-dependent replication kinetic differences between ICV and IDV. The viral replication kinetics were monitored as before, by collecting apical washes every 24 h, however this time for a duration of 120 h instead of 72. This was done because previously we only observed minor replication kinetic difference for IDV between 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. We observed that, after removing the inoculum and extensive washing, the viral RNA yield increases over time for both viruses at 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C (Figure 3A). However, during the first 24 h the viral RNA yield of ICV is approximately a 1\u20131.5 order of magnitude higher compared to IDV, but in the end reaches the same plateau level (Figure 3A). For both viruses, the viral RNA yield plateau at 33 \u00b0C is approximately one order of magnitude higher compared to 37 \u00b0C (Figure 3A). Interestingly, when we analyzed the viral titer of the corresponding samples, a gradual increase can be observed for ICV that reaches a plateau at 72 h. In contrast to ICV, we observed a steep increase at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C for IDV that reaches a plateau between 72\u201396 hpi. The steep increase results in a pronounced difference of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude difference in the production of infectious progeny virus between ICV and IDV (Figure 3B). This difference seems to be independent of the incubation temperature and clearly demonstrates that IDV replication on well-differentiated hAEC cultures is more efficient compared to ICV (Figure 3B).",

To discriminate between the ciliated and non-ciliated cell types, we used well-defined antibodies to visualize the cilia (\u03b2-tubulin IV) and tight junction borders (Zonula occludens-1, ZO-1). We used our IDV-NP-antibody for detection of IDV-infected cells, whereas for ICV we used the commercially available pooled human intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). We used IVIg since most people have encountered one or multiple ICV infections during their life and therefore this likely contains antibodies directed to ICV [39,40]. This we corroborated by an hemagglutination inhibition assay using IVIg (Figure S2). By overlaying the different cellular marker stains with that of the virus antigen, we observed that for both ICV and IDV the virus-antigen signal overlaps with that of the ciliated cell marker (Figure 3C,D).",

The majority of antigen-positive cells for both IDV and ICV overlapped with the ciliated cell marker with an overall percentage of 97.3 and 95.5, respectively (Figure 3E). This is in line with our initial observation and shows that both IDV and ICV have a predominant preference for ciliated cells. In addition to the cellular tropism, we also calculated the overall infection rate for IDV and ICV, which is 4.3% and 3.3%, respectively. The slightly higher infection rate of IDV compared to ICV seems to be in accordance with the previous observed differences in replication kinetics (Figure 3A,B).",

We also demonstrate that IDV viral progeny is replication competent, as it can be efficiently sequentially propagated onto well-differentiated hAEC cultures from different donors at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C. This seems to occur without extensive adaptation to the human host, as only a single non-synonymous mutation in the coding sequence of the HEF gene segment was identified among multiple samples. Intriguingly, the replication characteristics of IDV revealed much higher replication kinetics compared to Influenza C virus, despite sharing the cell tropism preference for ciliated cells. These results show that there is no intrinsic impairment for IDV propagation within the human respiratory epithelium.",

            "text": "For successful inter-species transmission, a virus needs to overcome several barriers before it can replicate efficiently in the new host species [41]. These barriers can be classified into three major groups; (i) viral entry through availability of the cellular receptor and proteases, (ii) viral replication and subversion of the host innate immune system followed by (iii) viral egress and release of infectious progeny virus. Our results clearly demonstrate that IDV fulfils most of these criteria for humans, as there is no fundamental restriction for viral replication and the sequential propagation of IDV within well-differentiated hAEC cultures from different donors did not lead to major genetic changes. Since only a single non-synonymous mutation was detected in the HEF protein among multiple samples. It is possible that this non-synonymous mutation results in some advantageous adaptation for the virus, however, since there is currently no reverse genetic system available for IDV, we cannot assess its functional relevance in our model at this time. Furthermore, we cannot assess whether IDV can be transmitted between humans with our model. Nonetheless, it has been demonstrated that IDV can be transmitted between both guinea pigs and ferrets, of which the latter is a surrogate model for assessing the transmission potential of emerging Influenza A viruses among humans [42,43,44,45,46]. This knowledge in combination with the detection of IDV in aerosols collected at an international airport, and the limited epidemiological data of IDV prevalence among humans, warrants the need for increased surveillance of IDV among humans [19,20].",

However, in our experiments we observed that ICV replicates efficiently in well-differentiated hAEC cultures at temperatures corresponding to both the upper and lower respiratory tract, albeit with a lower efficiency at 37 \u00b0C. This suggests that ICV in humans can replicate at lower regions in respiratory tract, which is in accordance with the detection of ICV in patients with lower respiratory tract infection [47]. Our results suggest that this is also possible for IDV that even had a higher replication efficiency at both temperatures in comparison to ICV. Similar observations have recently been made in undifferentiated primary nasal turbinate, tracheal and lung epithelial cells [48]. Nevertheless, whether the observed viral replication kinetics for ICV and IDV in our human in vitro surrogate model of the in vivo respiratory epithelium is recapitulated in those of swine and bovine origin remains to be evaluated. Especially, since both viruses have been demonstrated to be associated with respiratory infections in swine and cattle [1,2,49,50]. Furthermore, it is interestingly to note that in an experimental in vivo setting IDV can be found in both the upper and lower regions of the respiratory tract of cattle, whereas ICV has thus far only been detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates from the upper respiratory tract of cattle [11,49]. Therefore, it would be interesting to assess to which extend the different ambient temperatures in the upper and lower respiratory tract of both swine and cattle influences the viral replication efficiency of both ICV and IDV.",
