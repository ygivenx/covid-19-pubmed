The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) determines three-month mortality based on the following formula: 3.8\u00d7(log serum bilirubin [mg/dL])+11.2\u00d7(log INR)+9.6\u00d7(log serum creatinine [mg/dL])+6.4 [17].

For DHF by WHO 1997 classification, both AST and ALT were significantly higher during the febrile phase compared to DF or DSS, and for severe dengue by WHO 2009, AST and ALT were significantly higher during the febrile and critical phases.",

Tang et al. showed that dengue and hepatitis B co-infected patients showed an aberrant cytokine secretion profile compared with those with dengue alone. [25].

Because dengue infection can cause acute damage to these non-hepatic tissue types that express AST, raised aminotransferase levels may not be entirely due to severe liver involvement. It is therefore possible that the patients with high AST levels were also more likely to be classified as severe dengue under the 2009 criteria due to the common pathways to non-hepatic tissue damage, even though there is no association with poorer outcome.",

Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase values were tracked according to clinical judgment rather than at regular intervals during illness. We did not have dengue serotype data for each patient, but in 2006, DENV-1 was predominant in Singapore with a switch to DENV-2 in 2007\u20132008 [30]. Serology-positive cases were not included in primary analyses because our clinical laboratory used a rapid diagnostic test with potential for false positive results [31], we did not have paired sera to confirm dengue diagnosis [9], and not every patient with elevated AST or ALT was comprehensively evaluated for other etiologies of viral and non-viral hepatitis. Although serology-positive cases presented later during illness, we saw no difference in outcome. Five serology-positive patients (0.34%) required ICU admission versus 0.43% of PCR-positive cases, while four patients (0.27%) died in the serology-positive cohort, versus 1 patient (0.14%) among PCR-positive cases. However, relative data accuracy in our retrospective study was made possible by using a standardized dengue clinical care path. Another limitation of this study is the relatively few cases with substantially elevated liver aminotransferase levels. At the same time, since our cohort comprised primarily adults, additional studies in pediatric populations will be useful to confirm our findings.",
