            "text": "Worldwide acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are among the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in children [1,2]. While most ARTIs result in relatively mild and self-limiting disease, sometimes disease progresses to severe acute respiratory tract infections (SARIs). SARIs are characterized by respiratory failure and are an indication for admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) because of the need of respiratory support. Some viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses have been shown to be the single cause of SARI, but for other viruses like human rhinoviruses (HRVs) and human coronavirus-NL63 (HCoV-NL63) this is under debate [3\u20135]. It may be that these viruses cause minimal or mild disease only, but in combination with bacterial co-infections, viral co-infections or alternatively, underlying high-risk conditions infection may result into SARI [6\u20138]. This hypothesis follows observations of detection of viruses in the nasopharynx of children in absence of clinical signs and symptoms [9\u201312]. Another explanation for the variable association between infection and severe disease could be the extent of infection, as reflected by viral loads. High viral loads may be associated with increased host cell damage and a more profound immune response, but this relationship has not been confirmed consistently [13\u201315]. To address the possible causative role of virus infections in SARIs, we performed a retrospective study in our hospital, which has implemented routine testing for fifteen respiratory viruses over the study period.",

Erasmus MC-Sophia is a tertiary paediatric referral centre. Clinical and virological data were extracted from the clinical and laboratory databases. We collected all qualitative and quantitative diagnostic virological data obtained with real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on respiratory tract samples (nasal washing, sputum, throat swab, nose swab, or bronchoalveolar lavage specimen (BAL)) of patients admitted to PICU or medium care (MC). Nasal washings were obtained by infusing 1\u20132 ml NaCl intranasally. Samples were obtained on clinical indication. Only samples obtained upon admission or within 72 hours after admission were included. Patients could be included more than once if re-admitted with SARI or ARTI, and a sample was obtained > 35 days after the first discharge and tested positive for a different virus. For further analysis these patients (SARI: n = 1; ARTI: n = 1) were considered new patients. The following clinical data was obtained: age, gender, reason for admission, clinical diagnosis, underlying medical condition, specimen used for RT-PCR, C-reactive protein (CRP)-levels, bacteriological test results, types of respiratory support, length of PICU stay and hospital stay, and final outcome. Based on this clinical data, we subsequently grouped patients with SARI or ARTI as primary reason for PICU or MC admission respectively.",

In the present study we specifically focused on samples obtained from patients admitted to PICU or MC with SARI or ARTI, caused by a single virus infection in the absence of typical bacterial and viral co-infections (PICU-SARI patients and MC-ARTI patients respectively). We further defined respiratory support into supplemental oxygen need (nasal cannula), non-invasive respiratory support (non-rebreathing mask and optiflow), invasive respiratory support with endotracheal intubation (nasopharyngeal tube, trachea tube, trachea-cannula) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).",

Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct)-value < 40 were considered positive. Of note Ct-values are inversely correlated to viral load, and only provide semi-quantitative results. For the purpose of this study we combined RSV type A and B results and we excluded patient samples obtained during an emergency department visit, out-patient-clinic visit or from patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. Positive viral test results were traced back to patients admitted to PICU or MC. We compared all patients with a single virus detected and admitted to PICU with patients admitted to PICU with SARI (PICU-SARI patients), and all patients admitted to MC with patients with ARTI admitted to MC (MC-ARTI patients).",

Absence of sputum for bacteriological testing was not a reason for exclusion, as sputum could not be obtained from all children. Furthermore, we analysed other bacterial cultures if performed and a positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid, blood or BAL were defined as bacterial co-infection and thus a reason for exclusion from further analysis.

An overview of the epidemiological data is shown in S1 Fig. We identified 44 PICU-SARI patients with a median age of 9.6 months (LIQR 2 -UIQR 25, min 0.46\u2014max 152) and an equal gender distribution (males: 22/44, 50%) (Table 1). One patient was admitted twice because of SARI, with RSV or HRV as single causative agent detected, and with an admission interval of 23.5 months. Thirty-four patients had an underlying medical condition (34/44, 77%). The remaining ten patients were healthy until admission (10/44, 23%) (Table 1). The most common underlying medical condition was pre-term birth (10/34, 29%). Reasons for admission were: obstructive upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (9/44, 20%), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (15/44, 34%) and severe wheezing with respiratory distress (18/44, 41%). One patient was admitted with an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE (n = 1)) with SARI and one patient with SARI related respiratory fatigue due to muscular disease (n = 1) (2/44, 5%). Respiratory support consisted of supplemental oxygen (9/44, 20%), non\u2013invasive respiratory support including non-rebreathing mask and optiflow was given in eight patients (8/44, 18%), whereas 27 patients required invasive respiratory support (27/44, 61%). For one patient additional ECMO was applied due to insufficient oxygenation (1/44, 2%). RSV was more frequently detected in boys (9/13, 69%), most patients were admitted with bronchiolitis (10/13, 77%), six had no underlying medical condition (6/13, 46%), and eight required invasive respiratory support (8/13, 62%). HRV was detected in six girls (6/11, 55%), most patients were admitted with LRTI (4/11, 36%) or wheezing (4/11, 36%), all patients had an underlying medical condition, and seven patients required invasive respiratory support (7/11, 64%). Overall, the median PICU-stay was 3 days (min 0-max 39), after which patients were either transferred from PICU to MC (n = 14, 32%, after which n = 8 (57%) were transferred to another hospital or discharged n = 6 (43%)), transferred from PICU to another hospitals (n = 22, 50%) or were discharged after PICU admission (n = 8, 18%). Admission duration in other hospitals could not be analysed, as data was not available. The overall hospital stay for patients admitted to both PICU and MC was 7 days (min 3-max 30). Two patients died during PICU admission because of cardiorespiratory failure. One of these was a previously healthy child admitted for cardiorespiratory arrest upon influenza A virus infection, the other was a patient with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type-2, who developed respiratory failure due to PIV-3.",

In addition, nine others of the fifteen respiratory viruses tested for were identified as single agents that may be associated with SARI in previously healthy children as well as in children with a medical history. Except for ADV and HCoV-NL63, the remaining seven viruses were also associated with ARTI in previously healthy children as well as in children with a medical history. Our data does not support a relationship between viral load as reflected by surrogate marker Ct-values on the one hand and disease severity reflected by MC or PICU admission on the other. This is counter-intuitive and indeed various studies have indicated that higher viral loads are related to more severe disease as well as locally increased cytokine production [7,14,15,17\u201325]. Other studies failed to replicate this finding [11,26\u201329]. Our findings may have been influenced by the selection of hospitalized and seriously ill children. Although Ct-values as presented in our study do not represent an absolute quantitation of viral loads, we did use these semi-quantitative values as a surrogate marker for viral load in our patient samples, as is not unusual in this type of studies [14,20]. Moreover, viral load may be one of many factors that could be associated with disease severity. In this respect the role of a deleterious or counter-productive immune response may be a factor related to disease severity. This has been subject of several studies into the pathogenesis of viral respiratory disease and a better understanding may lead to novel targets for treatment of critically ill patients [30\u201338].",

We described eleven critically ill patients with HRV as single pathogen detected, supporting other studies that have described HRV as an agent that may cause more or less severe disease [3,41,42].

Indeed we cannot fully exclude that some of our patients may have had secondary or pre-existing bacterial infections during hospitalization. We can also not fully exclude the presence of atypical bacteria such as M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae or B. pertussis as these were not routinely tested for.
