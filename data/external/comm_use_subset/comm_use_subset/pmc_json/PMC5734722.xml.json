A major risk factor remains large volume antibiotic prescribing in primary and secondary care[1] and the rise of easily transmissible genetic elements encoding resistance to last-line antimicrobials raises the real possibility of a post-antibiotic era[2]. Rapid and accurate diagnosis would allow reduction in the volume of antimicrobial prescription. Respiratory tract infection remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide[3] and hence is a driver of antimicrobial prescription. However, in primary care these infections are often viral and self-limiting and antimicrobial prescription is not necessary. For example, it is estimated that of the 40 million antimicrobial prescriptions issued annually for RTI in the United States, 23 million are unnecessary [4]. Thus, there is a pressing need for novel point-of-care (POC) in-vitro diagnostics to reduce the over prescription of antimicrobials in respiratory tract infection (RTI) in primary care.",

The gold standard for VOC detection is gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS), which allows identification of individual VOCs. However, these instruments are large, expensive, cumbersome, usually laboratory based and require specialized staff to operate them and to interpret the data. Thus, the analysis and sample collection from the patient are often separated. Furthermore, for the detection of very low concentration gas phase biomarkers, they require the use of some form of pre-concentration system (typically achieved through the use of absorbent tubes using a material such as Tenax\u2122), followed by desorption into the GCMS for analysis.",

Readers are referred to a recent review for a comprehensive description of electronic nose devices and their potential use in respiratory medicine [13]. In brief, however, these instruments attempt to replicate the biological olfactory system and rely on an array of commercially available gas sensors, with overlapping sensitivities so that they are able to analyze a sample as whole. These instruments can be made smaller, are cheaper than GCMS, use air as the carrier gas and require minimal training to use. Though they have shown promise, many instruments either do not have the required sensitivity nor the repeatability required in a clinical setting (10). A recent development to solve these issues is the gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS). In these instruments, the GC component undertakes some separation of the complex chemical mixture and the IMS detects these separated chemicals with ultra-high sensitivity (down to parts per trillion)[14]. We hypothesized that a GC-IMS instrument could be used to collect exhaled breath samples at the bedside that could distinguish bacterial from viral RTI. We therefore performed a prospective cross sectional proof-of-concept study in hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of RTI in order to assess the feasibility of this technique.",

This was mounted on a hospital trolley and so could be brought to the patient\u2019s bedside. Patients delivered a breath sample directly into the machine by exhaling into a disposable mouthpiece. The patient was asked to inhale and then exhale a single deep breath. Only the last three seconds of exhaled breath was collected for analysis, ensuring analysis of end-tidal breath only; because of this, the exhaled breath was required to be greater than 3 seconds (typically 5 to 10 seconds). If a patient delivered a breath of less than three seconds (as timed by the device) they were asked to repeat. The results of VOC analyses were stored in the device\u2019s internal memory for later downloading and review. Because of the potential for strong flavours from food and drink to produce erroneous results, all patients were asked to eat nothing and drink only water for 30 minutes prior to providing samples, and to remain completely nil by mouth for 15 minutes prior to providing a sample. Although longer fasting periods have been used by other researchers, in practice within a secondary care setting, these periods of time were the best achievable. An ambient air sample was collected for each breath sample for comparison immediately after collection of the patient breath sample, in the room in which the patient had delivered the sample. This allows the background air contamination to be subtracted from the patient\u2019s sample. The total analysis time for each sample was 10 minutes. Fig 1 shows a typical output from the BreathSpec using a patient sample.",

The accuracy in this cohort was moderate: AUC 0.73 (95% CI 0.61\u20130.86). The testing procedure was well tolerated, and all patients who agreed to provide breath samples were able to do so, despite being hospitalized and around 50% of patients receiving supplemental oxygen. The vast majority (71/81 [88%]) of eligible patients who were approached agreed to participate.",

Most of these are either due to the small sample size or the exploratory nature of this study. Firstly, the diagnostic algorithm has not been validated in an external cohort. Secondly, rates of microbiologic testing that were performed on the cohort were low: 25% of patients had sputum culture sent and 21% had throat swab sent for viral multiplex PCR). As a result, there were few patients with confirmed bacterial and viral infections and the majority of patients were classified as probable bacterial or viral RTI on the basis of proxy radiographic and biochemical tests (chest radiography and CRP), rather than microbiologic tests. Although there is some evidence that a CRP of greater than 100mg/L is associated with bacterial RTI and a CRP of less than 20mg/L with viral RTI[16], CRP is an imperfect test for this purpose. As CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation it is also possible that defining our groups in the way we have done will split them by disease severity, rather than by aetiology. There is some evidence that this is the case, with the \u201call bacterial RTI\u201d group having a significantly lower oxygen saturation and higher respiratory rate, both markers of severity of disease. In this situation, any differing VOC signature could be related to severity specific host responses to disease, rather than the aetiologic agent.",

This is made more problematic by the fact that the low numbers of positive viral PCR results forced us to recruit patients identified in the laboratory to have positive results; in fact, the majority of the patients in the \u201cconfirmed viral RTI\u201d group were recruited in this way. This is another potential source of selection bias that could introduce a difference between the \u201call bacterial RTI\u201d and \u201cother RTI\u201d groups. The problem of low rates of identification of a causative organism is one that is common in both LRTI aetiology studies and clinical care[17].",

Fourthly, a decision was made not to use a wash-in (where the participant breathes clean or scrubbed air prior to exhaling into the device), which in principle could have resulted in ambient air VOCs being erroneously attributed to the patient. This decision was made because it may have been uncomfortable for our patient population of interest; that is, patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infection. To mitigate against misattribution of ambient air samples, a sample of room air was collected for each patient. In the event, the background air variations were small. In addition, as the unit uses a GC pre-separation it is likely that interfering molecules will be detected separately to any biomarkers, so a wash in is not critical in this situation.",

Further clinical studies are needed to validate this technique in much larger patient sets, using comprehensive diagnostic microbiology and robust case definitions agreed by an expert panel.
