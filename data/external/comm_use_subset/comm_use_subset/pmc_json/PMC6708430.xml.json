Even the most predictable zoonoses, such as Lassa fever virus from Mastomys natalensis and rabies from feral dogs, are estimated to kill thousands of individuals per year worldwide (Richmond & Baglole, 2003; Taylor & Nel, 2015). Less predictable spillover events also create large public health impacts. For instance, the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic killed more than 11,000 people over the course of the 30\u2010month epidemic (Kaner & Schaack, 2016), and outbreaks of SARS and MERS have killed hundreds (de Wit, Doremalen, Falzarano, & Munster, 2016). Although large\u2010scale vaccination campaigns of wild animals have shown the ability to reduce spillover events in temperate regions (e.g., Europe and North America for rabies in red foxes and raccoons), similar efforts cannot provide the coverage needed for control of most emerging zoonoses because of difficulties in reaching wildlife populations with conventional vaccines in the more remote and inaccessible environments where these pathogens frequently emerge.",

Conventional, nontransmissible vaccines protect only those individuals directly vaccinated (e.g., administered parenterally or through bait). In contrast, transmissible vaccines have the potential to reach more of the targeted wildlife population through animal\u2010to\u2010animal transmission. A transmissible vaccine works on the same principles as other live vaccines\u2014following administration to an individual, the vaccine leads to stimulation of a protective immune response\u2014but with its capacity for transmission, the vaccine is able to spread and immunologically protect other susceptible individuals beyond those directly vaccinated. Results from mathematical modeling indicate that transmissible vaccines substantially increase vaccine coverage and thereby the scope for pathogen elimination or eradication (Basinski et al., 2018; Nuismer et al., 2016; Nuismer, May, Basinski, & Remien, 2018). To date, transmissible vaccines remain largely untested. However, a transmissible vaccine comprised of an attenuated myxoma virus encoding an antigen from rabbit hemorrhagic fever virus (RHFV) was able to transmit between rabbits and proved protective against both myxoma and rabbit hemorrhagic fever (Angulo & Barcena, 2007; B\u00e1rcena et al., 2000). Efforts are now underway to develop transmissible vaccines targeting other pathogens in wildlife populations including Ebola and Lassa fever viruses in their natural animal reservoirs (Marzi et al., 2016; Murphy, Redwood, & Jarvis, 2016; Tsuda et al., 2011, 2015).",

Recombinant vector vaccines (RVVs) consist of an antigen\u2010expressing pathogen gene(s) engineered into a competent but avirulent viral vector (Bull et al., 2018). The possible combinations afforded by this approach appear almost unlimited, and the ability to choose vectors from a wide range of possibilities should permit rates and pathways of vaccine transmission to be tuned to at least some degree. However, recombinant vaccines face regulatory issues due to their genetically modified status, and the ability to transmit\u2014a big advantage in pathogen control\u2014may provide a hurdle to regulatory approval. There are multiple means by which transmissible RVVs may overcome potential regulatory issues for their use in wildlife populations. If the vaccine is only weakly transmissible (e.g., R0<1), the vaccine will inevitably approach extinction once it is no longer being directly administered to the target population (Nuismer et al., 2016). Similarly, if the vector occurs naturally in the host population, vector\u2010specific immunity may lead to vaccine extinction (Basinski et al., 2018). Finally, if the RVV is genetically unstable and progressively evolves to delete or downregulate the inserted transgene, the vaccine may revert over time, leaving behind only the original viral vector.",

As a result, it is currently unclear what level of instability can be tolerated for a transmissible vaccine to remain effective, or how unstable a transmissible vaccine needs to be to guarantee its ultimate extinction. This balance between immunogenicity and target antigen loss will dictate whether vaccine decay is slow enough to enable broad protection against a target pathogen but fast enough to ensure vaccine extinction in a reasonable time frame.",

In the absence of cross\u2010immunity, the dynamics of the transmissible vaccine and pathogen can be described without explicitly tracking the density of vector generated by reversion: When a reversion transforms vaccine to vector, the host that was vaccine\u2010infected merely moves back into the pool of susceptible hosts. Consequently, we need follow only the densities of hosts susceptible to vaccine and pathogen (S), infected with vaccine (V), infected with pathogen (P), or recovered from vaccine infection (RV) or pathogen infection (RP) and immune to infection by both vaccine and pathogen.

To bracket the range of possible scenarios, our second model assumes the opposite extreme of the first: complete cross\u2010immunity between vector and vaccine. Integrating cross\u2010immunity necessitates a more complex model where the dynamics of the vector are tracked explicitly. In this model, when a reversion transforms the vaccine into vector, the revertants are removed from the vaccine\u2010infected class (V) and moved to the vector\u2010infected class (M). Because the vector no longer carries or expresses pathogen genes, vector and pathogen share no cross\u2010immunity and can co\u2010infect. In contrast, because we assume the vaccine carries both pathogen and vector genes that elicit an immune response, cross\u2010immunity exists between vaccine and pathogen and vaccine and vector. We assume this cross\u2010immunity is complete and precludes co\u2010infection (Basinski et al., 2018).

This implies that, all else being equal, genetically unstable transmissible vaccines that generate short\u2010lived infections (i.e., large recovery rate, \u03b3V) will be more effective than those that generate long\u2010term infections from which the host recovers only very slowly (i.e., small recovery rate, \u03b3V).

Consequently, although we successfully solved for the critical level of direct vaccination required to prevent pathogen invasion, the expression becomes unwieldy. Instead, we report the key results gleaned from numerical investigations. Plotting the relative performance of a transmissible vaccine as a function of its basic reproductive number, R0,V, and reversion rate to vector, u, demonstrates that any cross\u2010immunity between vector and vaccine substantially reduces the scope for a transmissible vaccine to outperform a traditional vaccine (Figure 3, compare to Figure 2). This result generalizes previous work (Basinski et al., 2018) by showing that the rate of reversion to vector plays an important role. Specifically, in the presence of cross\u2010immunity, even rates of reversion as low as 1.5\u00d710-2day-1 (one reversion every 66.7 days, on average), can cause a highly transmissible vaccine to be outperformed by a conventional and directly administered vaccine (Figure 3). Here too, we find that, all else being equal, transmissible vaccines with a rapid host recovery rate are more effective than those with a slow recovery rate. The benefit of rapid host recovery is, once again, the reduction in opportunities for within\u2010host evolution to cause reversion of genetically unstable transmissible vaccines and the production of insert\u2010free vector with which the vaccine must effectively compete. These results demonstrate that when cross\u2010immunity between vector and vaccine exists, the development of effective transmissible vaccines will depend on engineering highly stable recombinant vector vaccines with low rates of reversion to vector.",

We investigated the scope for resolving this conflict by identifying parameter combinations that allowed the vaccine to first eradicate the pathogen and then subsequently self\u2010extinguish (Figure 5). This analysis confirmed the challenge of engineering an effective, yet self\u2010extinguishing, transmissible vaccine and demonstrates that reversion rate, u, and vaccine/vector basic reproductive number, R0,V, must fall within a narrow band of combinations (Figure 5).

The reason is that, although cross\u2010immunity makes pathogen eradication more challenging, it practically guarantees that a transmissible vaccine self\u2010extinguishes from competition with vector, although this process may be slow when rates of reversion are not appreciable. On balance, then, cross\u2010immunity does little to reduce opportunities for designing an effective, self\u2010extinguishing, vaccine. Cross\u2010immunity does, however, affect the parameter combinations that enable success, requiring increased transmission rates and reduced reversion rates (to see this, compare the bottom rows of Figures 5 and 6). Just as in the absence of cross\u2010immunity, the scope for engineering an effective and self\u2010extinguishing transmissible vaccine is substantially greater when recovery from vector/vaccine infection is relatively rapid (i.e., \u03b3V is relatively large).

Our results demonstrate that recombinant vector vaccines can remain effective, even when genetically unstable and prone to reversion to insert\u2010free vector. Not surprisingly, this is particularly true for transmissible vaccines that experience little cross\u2010immunity with the viral vector. In addition to confirming the importance of cross\u2010immunity, our results show that, all else being equal, those vaccines that transmit rapidly and generate only short\u2010lived infection will be the most tolerant to genetic instability. Short\u2010lived infections are favorable because they reduce opportunities for mutation and strain selection within hosts to increase the abundance of revertant vaccine.",

The most immediate reason for ensuring that transmissible vaccines self\u2010extinguish is for regulatory reasons. In this respect, deletion of the insert would restore the vaccine to the status of viral vector, an entity that may be naturally circulating in the wild population. Fortunately, deletion is also the process most easily controlled by engineering. For example, deletions are well known to occur between direct repeats in DNA (Cunningham et al., 1997; Springman, Molineux, Duong, Bull, & Bull, 2012), and modification or elimination of those repeats reduces the spontaneous rate of deletions (Sleight, Bartley, Lieviant, & Sauro, 2010). Genome engineering may also afford the possibility of designing accelerating rates of genomic instability. Our model assumed a constant rate of decay to revertant; a rate that accelerated over time would have many advantages. Such methods are not obviously ready for implementation, but they are at least suggested by \u201ccounting mechanisms\u201d that have been employed in bacteria (reviewed in Bull & Barrick, 2017).",

In most cases, the choice of a vector may be based on considerations that lie outside model results, and the model results will then inform the possibilities and avenues for success. Consider cytomegalovirus (CMV), a vector currently being used in the development of transmissible vaccines targeting Ebola and Lassa fever (Marzi et al., 2016; Murphy et al., 2016; Tsuda et al., 2011, 2015). CMV appears promising because of its high level of species specificity, and ability to readily reinfect previously infected hosts (Murphy et al., 2016), a property shown to be critically important here, and in a previous study (Basinski et al., 2018). In contrast, our results also illuminate a potential weakness of CMV, which tends to generate long\u2010lived infections that our results suggest increase opportunities for vaccine reversion. Ultimately, a rigorous assessment of vector quality will require robust estimates for key parameters such as transmission rates and rates of reversion to vector, something that should be a central focus of ongoing efforts to engineer successful transmissible vaccines.",

One important assumption is that reversion from vaccine to vector has no impact on rates of transmission, despite the clear reasons to expect greater rates of vector transmission after the genetic cargo has been unloaded. Although we did not explicitly model this scenario, we expect doing so would support our current results. For instance, if the vector transmits more rapidly than the vaccine, we expect cross\u2010immunity to become even more important and the efficacy of a transmissible vaccine to be further reduced. As a consequence, the difference between vectors that generate cross\u2010immunity and those that do not would become even more significant. Another important assumption of our model is that it is possible to directly vaccinate newborn animals and that these newborn animals have the same rate of transmission as adult animals. If recovery from vaccine infection is rapid and newborn animals have limited encounters with the population at large, this could substantially limit the efficacy of a transmissible vaccine. Evaluating how this important assumption influences our results will require more complex models that explicitly integrate age structure. Finally, our modeling framework focuses on a single well\u2010mixed population and thus ignores potential impacts of spatial heterogeneity (Basinski, Nuismer, & Remien, 2019) and population structure (Varrelman, Basinski, Remien, & Nuismer, 2019).",

Identifying the quantitative impact transmissible vaccines are likely to have on real pathogen populations, however, will require considerable progress in estimating key parameters such as vector transmission rates, recovery rates, and rates of reversion to insert\u2010free vector.
