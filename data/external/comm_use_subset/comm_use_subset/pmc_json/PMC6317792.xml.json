            "text": "Viral acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are associated with cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells that exhibit diminished production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. Though these cells recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I\u2013restricted viral epitopes, ex vivo stimulation of these cells with these same viral peptides fails to elicit production of interferon (IFN)\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-2, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1; degranulation as measured by CD107a staining; or other features of functional CD8+ T cells. This is a unique feature of viral ARI because T-cell dysfunction occurs in chronic rather than acute infections of many other organs. Although CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to CD8+ T-cell dysfunction, recent work on a variety of viruses has identified inhibitory receptors as a key mediator of this phenotype. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is the most well-studied inhibitory receptor in T-cell impairment, but there is growing evidence that other inhibitory receptors also play a role. The tendency of CD8+ T cells to have significantly reduced functionality in the context of respiratory virus infection has been termed \"T cell impairment\".",

In mouse models, absence of CD8+ T cells leads to delayed clearance of viruses, whereas humans that have defects in T-cell immunity associated with aging, immune suppression, or cancer tend to have more severe infections and poorer outcomes [1, 2]. However, despite this clear need for CD8+ T-cell\u2013mediated immunity, infections due to a broad range of acute viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pneumonia virus of mice, vaccinia virus (respiratory but not systemic infection), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and others, have been associated with a state called T-cell impairment [3\u201311]. Broadly defined, T-cell impairment occurs when virus-specific CD8+ T cells fail to produce inflammatory cytokines or perform cytotoxic functions at the site of infection, while the same virus-specific cells at other sites, such as the spleen, are completely functional (Fig 1). Epitope-specific cells in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes are completely functional [7]. This suggests that the inflammatory environment of the lung parenchyma drives the process of T-cell impairment during ARI.",

It also appears to require active infection, because dendritic cell vaccination leads to functional virus-specific CD8+ T cells [4]. However, adoptive transfer of cells into a na\u00efve lung causes the transferred cells to lose some effector potential, though infection further decreases the function of these cells, indicating that the lung environment itself may program some degree of suppression even in settings without infection [12, 13]. Impairment also occurs during secondary infections [3\u20137, 14], which may indicate one reason why humans have poor T-cell memory to respiratory viruses and are susceptible to reinfection.",

            "text": "Much work remains to fully elucidate the mechanisms of impairment. One essential component is the action of inhibitory receptors, the most well-described being PD-1. PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors interfere with signaling through the T-cell receptor and thus have far reaching consequences on T-cell function, from cytokine release to metabolism [20\u201322]. PD-1 signaling alters metabolism in multiple ways: it suppresses PI3k (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation, diverts metabolic pathways away from glycolysis and towards fatty acid oxidation, and increases reactive oxygen species that promote apoptosis [21, 23, 24]. PD-1 is expressed on T and B cells, as well as occasionally on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [25]. PD-1 has two ligands, PD-L1 (expressed on almost all cell types) and PD-L2 (expressed on APCs and B cells). PD-1 is up-regulated by antigen stimulation, while inhibitory ligands are induced by interferons [25]. Because antigen stimulation and interferon release tend to occur simultaneously only at the site of infection, this facilitates impairment specifically in the infected tissue and explains why T cells in the spleen or lymph node are not impaired in ARI.",

T-cell exhaustion requires long-term antigen exposure before inhibitory receptors become up-regulated. Acute LCMV infection is associated with transient PD-1 expression, whereas chronic LCMV infection leads to sustained PD-1 expression on epitope-specific T cells [28]. In contrast, T-cell impairment is seen relatively early (day 7\u20138) in the adaptive immune response to ARI, and PD-1 expression remains high on lung lymphocytes weeks after virus is cleared [4]. Additionally, during T-cell exhaustion, there are subsets of exhausted T cells that can be rescued by anti\u2013PD-1 blockade or that remain terminally differentiated and unresponsive to PD-1 blockade [29, 30]. It is not yet known whether similar subsets of impaired T cells exist in the lung.",
