            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is of significant importance for production and animal welfare in the cattle industry\n[1-3]. The bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major contributors to BRD, inducing clinical signs that may vary from none to fatal\n[4,5]. The seroprevalence is generally found to be high, with up to 100% seropositive herds in some areas\n[6-10]. A recent nationwide serological study indicated that 54% of the dairy herds in Norway had BRSV present in the herd the previous year\n[11]. BRSV infections can appear as epidemics with outbreaks affecting many animals in several herds within the same area or as part of protracted respiratory disease problems in single herds, i.e. enzootic pneumonia. BRD epidemics occur frequently in Norway during the winter, when the animals are housed indoors. BRSV was isolated in Norway already in 1976 during a severe epizootic outbreak which spread throughout most of the country\n[12]. Only sporadic outbreaks were reported in the following years, but in 1995 another severe epidemic was reported\n[13]. The Norwegian cattle population is currently free from bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV 1)\n[14] and bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV)\n[15], and Mycoplasma bovis has never been detected\n[16].",

The gene coding for the surface cell attachment glycoprotein (G protein) has the highest reported mutation rate and is commonly used as the target for investigations involving molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic analysis\n[17]. The G protein is one of the main targets associated with induction of protective immunity\n[18] and the high variability of the protein could indicate that the acquired immune response constitutes an important selective pressure. Previous studies have shown that quasispecies of BRSV are present in vivo. The role of this quasispecies distribution is uncertain, but it could represent a reservoir for virus adaptation during infection\n[19,20]. Antigen variation of the G protein as an escape mechanism in relation to the use of vaccines have been discussed\n[4,21]. Vaccines against BRSV are rarely used in Norway.",

In brief, RNA was incubated at 65\u00b0C for five min and chilled on ice, and RT reaction was run using Superscript III RT (Invitrogen) and the G2.5 primer and incubated at 55\u00b0C for 60 min. For the nested PCR the primer sets G2.5, F2.7 and VG1, VG4, respectively were used\n[17]. The cycling conditions were 40 cycles with 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s using the PfuUltra II Fusion HS (Agilent Technologies) DNA polymerase. The cycles were preceded by a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for one min and completed by an elongation step at 72\u00b0C for three min. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification protocol (Qiagen), and nucleotide sequences were obtained (Sanger sequencing) from a total of 24 samples (GATC Biotech AG, Germany). Primer sequences were removed prior to analysis. The sequences of animals from 10 herds and from a Norwegian BRSV isolate from 1976 (A1/N/76), which also originated from an epidemic in the South-Eastern area of Norway, were included. The nucleotide sequences used in this study have been submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession numbers KF501149 \u2013 KF501172.",

This is in accordance with previous findings of Larsen et al.\n[27] that revealed that cell-culture adaption and passages in cells and/or calves did not induce extensive changes in the G protein gene. When the PCR products were generated for sequencing in the present study, a proof-reading polymerase was used to minimise procedure generated mutations.

The deduced amino acid sequences retrieved in our study could be divided into two clades where six nucleotide substitutions systematically gave a difference of five amino acids between the clades. Prozzi et al.\n[28] showed that the antigenic subgroups are related to the sequence variability of the central conserved region (codon position 154 to 192) of the G protein. In another study, Langedijk et al.\n[29] demonstrated that two point mutations at positions 180 and 205 defined the classification of the antigenic subgroups. Some of the differences observed in the present study were located in the area that is determinative for antigen subgrouping\n[29] as well as in the conserved central hydrophobic region\n[17]. Amino acid residue 205 of the Norwegian strain B is a Pro, while for strain A and the other aligned isolates Ala is present. Proline can impede the protein folding and thus potentially modify properties of the G protein. In the study of the evolution of BRSV by Valarcher et al.\n[17], Ala205 was found for subgroups I and II while Thr205 was present for the other subgroups. It was speculated whether this could introduce an O-glycosylation site that could modify the antigenicity of the linear epitope described for positions 199 to 209\n[29]. Furthermore the Ala205 to Thr205 substitution caused lack of binding of a specific MAb used for antigenic subgrouping of BRSV\n[29]. This illustrates the central role of residue 205 and could indicate that the Ala205 to Pro205 mutation found in our material could be a factor that would ease the similar spatiotemporal circulation of both strains. It is interesting that the two distinct strains were not found within the same herd. A recent Swedish study with samples from different parts of Sweden showed that the viral G protein sequences were highly similar\n[30] and could not be divided into distinct strains while in Denmark extensive sequence divergence (11%) of the G protein gene was found in recurrent outbreaks in closed herds\n[19].",

The distant relation between this isolate and the current Norwegian strains do not indicate if the current strains are direct descendants, or if they only originate from a common ancestor. This isolate, causing a large outbreak of BRSV in Norway at that time, was originally thought to be introduced to Norway by an animal imported from Denmark\n[12]. Further studies, including samples from the time period between these isolates, are needed to determine the origin of the current strains.",
