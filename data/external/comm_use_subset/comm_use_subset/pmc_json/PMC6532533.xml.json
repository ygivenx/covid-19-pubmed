Recently, a retrospective analysis carried out in a single center in Washington identified at least one respiratory virus in 22% of adults with non-ventilated HAP (21). The higher frequency of respiratory viruses found in our study could be due to the systematic active surveillance of nosocomial pneumonia and, compared with the study by Valenti et al., to the availability of molecular methods that increased the sensitivity for the detection of respiratory viruses in our study.",

This coincides with the findings of previous studies, in which the main viruses identified in patients with HAP were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and coronavirus (21, 23, 27\u201329). This highlights the relevance of infection control measures in preventing the spread of respiratory viruses from patients, caregivers and healthcare personnel, focusing not only on individuals with influenza-like illness, but also those with common colds or other respiratory symptoms. It also highlights the importance of developing effective vaccines and drug therapies for respiratory viruses other than influenza, given the current scarcity of preventive and therapeutic interventions. Despite the lack of specific treatment for most cases of VAHAP, routine identification of respiratory viruses in these patients could be useful to support a decision of withholding or stopping antibiotics in certain cases with no evidence of bacterial infection, potentially reducing adverse effects, costs and drug resistance.",

However, when comparing the baseline characteristics of these subjects with those who were not included, no statistically significant differences were observed (Table 1), which supports the representativeness of the sample. On the other hand, tests such as broncho alveolar lavage, or broncho alveolar brushing, which could increase the sensitivity to bacteria, are scarcely performed because they are considered invasive and not essential for patient care. Although difficult to overcome, this could be an important limitation because we were not able to assure that the infection was solely due to a viral etiology. In addition, we did not interfere in the management of the patients and, therefore, the frequency of these tests and others, such as PCT or CRP, was not altered during the study. More studies with the routine use of PCT or other markers of bacterial infections are needed. Another issue that should be clarified in further studies is the clinical implications of each type of respiratory viruses since some of them (i.e., influenza, SRV) are considered clinically relevant more often than others, such as parainfluenza and some types of rhinovirus, and our study was not powered to detect such differences. Lastly the study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital with a non-homogeneous sample of patients in which two thirds of the participants had at least one known risk factor for viral pneumonia, such as chronic lung disease (67%), congenital heart disease (29%), and neoplasia (27%), so the results obtained should be taken into account in this context and not necessarily generalized to all pediatric patients with HAP.",
