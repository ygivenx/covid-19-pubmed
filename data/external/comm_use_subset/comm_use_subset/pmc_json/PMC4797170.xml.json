            "text": "The interferon inducible anti-viral 2-5 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) enzyme is part of the cellular innate immune response [1\u20133]. There are eight to ten OAS isoforms due to alternative splicing and gene duplications [4, 5]. In humans, the OAS gene family is composed of four genes on locus 12q24.1-q24.2: hOAS1, hOAS2, hOAS3 and hOASL [6, 7]. A pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) such as dsRNA or mRNA with significant double stranded structures stimulates OAS to catalyze the polymerization of ATP to form 2\u2019-5\u2019-linked oligomers of adenylate (2-5As) [4, 8]. The subsequent elongation reaction is (n + 1) ATP \u2192 Ppp5\u2019A(2\u2019p5\u2019A)n + nPPi [9]. 2-5A functions through its receptor, the 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease (RNaseL), a ubiquitous 83-kDa protein that dimerizes into its catalytically active form upon binding 2-5A [4, 10, 11]. The activated RNaseL cleaves the single stranded RNA with UU or UA dinucleotide at the 3\u2019 end [4, 8, 12, 13]. Thus activated OAS-RNaseL system degrades viral and cellular RNA and subsequently inhibits protein synthesis [14]. Earlier studies also showed that OAS-RNase L system triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway [15, 16]. It is also known that OAS silencing attenuates interferon induced anti-proliferative and antiviral signaling and stimulates anchorage independent cell growth [8]. The exogenous recombinant porcine OAS1 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity through the activation of the IFN system that is independent of RNaseL [17]. Thus OAS1 dependent polymerization of ATP regulates multiple cellular functions that are dependent or independent of RNaseL.",

The haplotype variations in OAS1 gene also confer susceptibility to multiple sclerosis [23]. A recent study also showed a non-synonymous SNP rs2660 (G-A) is associated with racial disparities in prostate cancer [24]. It is being demonstrated that OAS1 gene alternative splicing is in part due to SNP at the splice acceptor site (rs10774671) generates p46 and p48 isoforms with different ATP polymerization activity [25]. Collectively, SNPs in OAS gene results in variation in activity of the enzyme which could be associated increased susceptibility for several disorders listed above. Thus, development of a simple and accurate assay to detect the activity of OAS1 enzyme is of significant clinical interest.",

Later, Justesen et al. developed a method to separate radioactive ATP and 2-5A by PEI-cellulose thin layer chromatography without the use of alkaline phosphatase [30]. The method was subsequently improved to measure inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) through a spectrophotometric assay [9]. This method is a coupled enzymatic reaction utilizing three enzymes UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The coupled reaction results in formation of NADPH which is measured by fluorescence spectroscopy [9]. The use of extensive OAS1 chromatographic purification steps, expensive reagents, and series of reactions utilized in this methodology to detect OAS enzyme has made it more cumbersome, laborious and expensive.",

The phosphate generated during the enzymatic reaction converts the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (methylthioguanosine, a guanosine analogue; MESG) to a purine base product, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine and ribose1-phosphate via a catalyst purine nucleoside phosphorylase. This conversion causes a shift in absorbance from 330 nm of substrate (MESG) to 360 nm of purine base product (2-amino-6mercapto-7-methylpurine) [31]. Further this method was modified to detect pyrophosphates generated in several biochemical reactions by converting the pyrophosphates to inorganic phosphates by a phosphatase. Thus the reaction producing pyrophosphate can be coupled to inorganic phosphate detection [31]. This modified method of detecting pyrophosphate has been known to measure activity of acetyl CoA synthetase and amino-acyl-tRNA synthetase activity which are also involved in pyrophosphate generation [32, 33]. The modified pyrophosphate detection method is also employed in hydroxamate-MESG assay which measures the activity of adenylating enzyme via measurement of pyrophosphate generated from ATP during the activation of carboxylic acid to form acyl-adenylate intermediate. The coupled hydroxamate assay characterizes the adenylate enzyme that do not undergo rapid ATP \u2013PPi exchange during the acylation of the protein substrate like hydroxamate [34].",

We exploited the polymerization reaction which converts ATP in the elution buffer to 2-5A and pyrophosphates by poly I:C affinity purified OAS and coupled the OAS enzyme reaction generating pyrophosphate with the modified method of detecting pyrophosphates based on conversion of MESG substrate to purine based product 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine by phosphates.

The bound enzyme was eluted and was analyzed for the expression of p46 isoform of OAS1 before testing the purified lysates to detect OAS enzyme activity. The OAS1 (p46) isoform protein expression was detected in crude cell lysates from DU145 cell lines but was absent or non-detectable in 293T, LNCaP and RWPE1 cell lines. The 293T cell line was used as a negative control as it lacks the active form of OAS1 (Fig. 2a). Figure 2b shows the OAS1 (p46) isoform expression in the cell lysates purified by Poly I:C conjugated Sepharose beads. OAS1 (p46) was detected in the poly I:C sepharose affinity purified lysates from DU145 cells but not in the purified lysates from other prostate cell lines and 293T cells. Thus the presence of OAS1 in purified lysates of DU145 suggested that the poly I:C conjugated sepharose affinity purification system is functional and results in the enrichment of OAS enzyme. The absence of detectable OAS enzyme from the DU145 cell lysate purified with inactivated Sepharose beads with no bound poly I:C used as a negative control further supports the specificity of the affinity purification system. Furthermore, no GAPDH expression was observed in the purified fraction suggesting the poly I:C conjugated sepharose beads specifically captured only OAS (Fig. 2b). The first wash flow through, collected after binding of OAS enzyme to poly I:C-sepharose beads resulted in undetectable p46 OAS1 enzyme suggesting that the affinity column captured essentially all the enzyme present in the cell lysate (Fig. 2b). These purified fractions were used for detecting OAS enzyme assay by simple and rapid pyrophosphate assay.",
