FluA is further classified on the basis of two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) [1, 2]. All subtypes of FluA comprise various combinations of the H and N glycoproteins. Sixteen H subtypes (H1-H16) and nine N subtypes (N1-N9) have been characterized in avian species, while the H17N10 subtype is found in bats [3, 4]. Most subtypes of FluA virus such as H5 and H7 subtypes are not pathogenic in poultry, but outbreaks in poultry and wild birds are correlated with the highly virulent FluA virus, which can cause severe economic losses owing to massive numbers of deaths of domestic poultry [4\u20136].",

It will be a challenge to control the H7N9 outbreak in humans before it spreads further. Currently, sporadic cases, but no evident outbreaks, of this novel virus have been documented in wild birds and poultry, and there is some limited evidence of human-to-human transmission during unprotected exposure [12], and there are no vaccines for humans.",

The primers and probes for the H7 and N9 genes were designed within certain regions of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes that are relatively conserved among all H7N9 subtypes, thus allowing the detection of all human and avian H7N9 viruses.

No co-infections with viruses were found in the multiplex tests, 819 samples tested negative for FluA, and the Ct values of RP gene were all positive with 18.5 ~ 29.6 for 1,011 clinical specimens (Table 5). In comparison, the Ct values of RP gene were also all positive with 18.6 ~ 29.8 in 1,011 samples, 192 specimens tested positive for FluA using the WHO protocol. With respect to the H7 gene, both assays identified 35 positive samples. However, the multiplex assay also detected 35 positive samples with respect to the N9 gene, while the WHO protocol only detected 32 positives, and the Ct value of N9 gene in three patients was high with 36 ~ 38 indicating low titres of the H7N9 virus. In an addition, to demonstrate whether the three N9 samples that differed between the two assays were positive or negative, firstly, we amplified DNA products using N9-specific primers, and DNA sequencing of the cloned products revealed that these three samples were confirmed to be positive. Secondly, the sputum of the three cases was individually re-collected and re-detected again, and the Ct values of the three cases in N9 gene were all less than 34. In the three cases, the Ct values of RP gene were individually 27.5 ~ 28.5 (the early samples) and 26.8 ~ 28.5 (the late samples) in the twice samples. Moreover, 35 patients with confirmed novel H7N9 virus infections accepted hospital treatments and their clinical specimens (including throat swab [135 specimens], sputum or tracheal aspirates [160 specimens], etc.) were tested for the presence and distribution of the H7N9 virus by the multiplex and WHO-recommend real-time RT-PCR assays every day following admission, which contributed to the evaluation of therapeutic treatments received by the patients. Eight fecal samples from the 35 patients tested positive for the H7N9 virus using the multiplex assay, while only seven tested positive using the WHO-recommend assay. No positive results for the H7N9 virus were found in blood (35 specimens), urine (30 specimens), cerebrospinal fluid (one specimen), pleural fluid (one specimen) and bone marrow specimens (two specimens). The results of the throat swabs and sputum or tracheal aspirates specimens from 35 patients with H7N9 infections were shown in Figure 1. The results demonstrate that the H7N9 virus persisted in sputum or tracheal aspirate specimens for an average of 6.14 days, while the virus persisted in throat swab samples for 2.42 days.",

            "text": "Subsequently, additional real-time RT-PCR methods for the detection of avian influenza A (H7N0) were published as the virus emerged in China [14, 19\u201324]. These methods were only applied to the analysis of the H7 and N9 genes of the H7N9 virus and did not include the M gene, which aids in the determination of novel H7N9 viruses. Nor did they use the RP gene, which can be used as a control to monitor the quality of clinical samples to ensure accurate results [1, 2]. Additionally, the sequences of the primers recommended by the WHO contained slight discrepancies from those found in publicly available gene databases of novel H7N9 viruses isolated from human cases. Thus, the M, H, and N primer sets in the WHO protocol do not exactly match the sequences of the novel H7N9 virus (Table 1) [13]. For example, the 6th base of the FluA reverse primer was changed from \u201cG\u201d to \u201cA\u201d, the 3rd base of the H7 reverse primer was altered from \u201cC\u201d to \u201cT\u201d, and the 2nd and 23rd bases of the N9 forward primer and the 19th base of the N9 reverse primer were altered from \u201cT\u201d to \u201cG\u201d, \u201cT\u201d to \u201cG\u201d, and \u201cA\u201d to \u201cG\u201d, respectively, relative to the novel H7N9 sequences. These errors may adversely affect viral detection in clinical specimens. Therefore, the nucleotide sequences of primers and probes should be modified according to the variation of novel influenza virus H7N9 sequences.",

The primers and probes in the multiplex assay were designed using the Influenza Primer Design Resource. The H7 and N9 primers and probes exactly match the sequences of the novel high virulent H7N9 virus for humans and low pathogenic avian H7N9 virus, and the FluA primers and probes completely match the M gene of most FluA viruses using base degeneracy rules (Table 1). For example, the 6th base of the H7 forward primer and 15th base of the H7 reverse primer are \u201cR\u201d, indicating \u201cA\u201d or \u201cG\u201d, and the 5th, 23rd and 26th bases of the H7 probe are \u201cR\u201d, \u201cY\u201d and \u201cY\u201d, which indicate \u201cA\u201d or \u201cG\u201d, \u201cC\u201d or \u201cT\u201d and \u201cC\u201d or \u201cT\u201d, respectively.

The positive results of the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay were generally in accordance with that of the real-time RT-PCR assay in the WHO protocol. As previously noted, the Ct values for the amplification of the H7, N9, FluA and RP genes in the two assays were generally similar. In an addition, the Ct values for RP gene assessed by both assays were low with 18.5 to 29.8 in these clinical specimens, which indicated good qualities of clinical specimens.

Remarkably, the percentage of positive sputum or tracheal aspirate specimens (100%) was higher than that of the throat swabs samples (71.43%) on the first day after hospital admission, and the average number of days that patients\u2019 sputum or tracheal aspirate samples tested positive for H7N9 viruses (mean value =6.14 days) was significantly greater than that of the patients\u2019 throat swabs samples (mean value =2.42 days).
