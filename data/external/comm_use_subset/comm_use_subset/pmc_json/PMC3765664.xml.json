Pseudovirus expressing VSV-G was included as the positive control. The target cells were respectively infected with MERS-CoV pseudovirus normalized for equal HIV-1 p24 content, and luciferase activity was measured at 72 h after infection. As shown in Figure 1, almost all tested human cells and a variety of animal cells could be infected by the produced pseudovirus. Particularly, MERS-CoV pseudovirus infected HT-1080 and SARS receptor-expressing ACE2-293T cells, maintaining a high infective ability in identified MERS-CoV receptor DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells. In addition, human cell types, such as Hep-2, HEP-G2, A549 and MT-2, and animal cell types, including FRhK-4, MDCK, Vero, Vero E6 and NBL-7, were infected by MERS-CoV pseudovirus to a significantly higher degree than other cell types, such as PK15, Caco-2 and HeLa. However, no high infectivity was observed in MA-104. Our results also demonstrated that VSV-G positive control could highly infect almost all tested cell types, possibly due to the broad host range of VSV-G in the capability of infecting multiple tissues in various hosts, while Env- pseudovirus negative control was unable to infect tested cell lines [10] (Figure 1).",

As shown in Figure 2A, clear bands corresponding to the HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S protein were identified in the generated pseudovirus of MERS-CoV by using antibodies against HIV-1 p24 and MERS-CoV S protein, respectively, while there was only p24, but no MERS-CoV S antigen, was detected in the VSV-G pseudovirus containing p24. These data suggest that specific S protein of MERS-CoV was effectively incorporated into the packaged HIV-1 particle, generating MERS-CoV pseudovirus. Western blot was also carried out to detect the expression of DPP4 in cells susceptible to pseudotyped MERS-CoV. Among the tested cells, PK-15 exhibited the highest expression of DPP4, followed by Huh-7. While DPP4 was expressed in FRhK4, HEP-G2, Caco-2, Vero, Vero E6, and MDCK cells, a relatively low level of this protein was detected in the cells of A549 and ACE2/293T cells. Nevertheless, no DPP4 expression was shown in HT-1080, Hep-2, MT-2, HeLa, NBL-7, 293T and MA-104 (Figure 2B-C).",

As shown in Figure 3A, three tested representative mouse sera demonstrated neutralizing activity (>96%) against MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection in the DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells at titers of 1:160, while the control sera from mice immunized with PBS showed no neutralizing activity against tested pseudovirus. The above sera were further evaluated for neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection using a live MERS-CoV-based inhibition assay. The results indicated that neutralizing antibodies of these sera (test sera 1\u20133 and control sera 1\u20133) corresponded to those tested by pseudovirus inhibition assay (Figure 3B), suggesting that the established pseudovirus-based inhibition assay is sufficiently reliable to evaluate neutralizing antibodies induced by candidate vaccines against MERS-CoV.",

As shown in Figure 4A, a small molecule HIV entry inhibitor targeting gp41 (ADS-J1) [12,13] and the 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified human serum albumin (HP-HSA) targeting HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 receptor, CD4 [14] could inhibit >90% and >68% of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at the concentration of 20 and 2.5 \u03bcM, respectively, when tested in NBL-7 cells. However, the highly potent peptidic HIV entry inhibitors, C34 and T20 [15], showed moderate inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at 2.5 and 20 \u03bcM. To further confirm our results, we detected the inhibitory ability of HP-HSA and ADS-J1 compounds as well as C34 and T20 peptides in the DPP4-expressing cell line Huh-7 [8]. Interestingly, the results were similar to those for the same compounds tested in NBL-7 cells, with around 90% of MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry inhibition at concentrations of 20 \u03bcM (Figure 4B). These two compounds, which carry net negative charges, may interact with the positively charge residues in the spike protein of the pseudotyped MERS-CoV, in a similar way as they inhibited infection of HIV [12-14]and other enveloped viruses, such as inhibition of SARS-CoV infection by ADS-J1 [16] and inhibition of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection by HP-HSA [17]. However, C34 and T20 peptides at 20 \u03bcM did not show any inhibitory activity in Huh-7 (Figure 4B), suggesting that these peptides are unable to inhibit MERS-COV pseudovirus entry into the DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells. As expected, none of the compounds inhibited pseudotypes containing VSV-G when tested in NBL-7 and Huh-7 cell lines (Figure 4A and 4B).",

ADS-J1 exhibited some cytotoxicity to Huh-7 cells with CC50 (the concentration causing 50% cytotoxicity) of 26.9 \u03bcM. However, its IC50 (the concentration causing 50% inhibition of MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection) is 0.6 \u03bcM and its selective index (CC50/IC50) is about 45. These data indicated that the decreased infectivity of the peudotyped MERS-CoV in the presence of these compounds is not due to their cytotoxicity, but is associated with their inhibition on MERS-CoV entry. These results confirmed that the established pseudovirus inhibition assay could be used as an effective way to rapidly screen MERS-CoV entry inhibitors.",

In this study, we generated a pseudotyped MERS-CoV based on the viral surface S protein, and detected its infectivity in different cell types. Indeed, the generated pseudovirus was able to infect a variety of cell lines, including human and non-human cell types. Generally, its cell susceptibility was consistent with that of wildtype MERS-CoV reported previously [18], being able to maintain high infectivity in DPP4-expressing cells, such as Huh-7, MDCK, Vero, Vero E6, FRhK4, HEP-G2, and A549, and incapable of infecting HeLa and MA-104 cells with no DPP4 expression. Its infectivity to DPP4-expressing PK-15 and Caco-2 cells was relatively lower than that of wildtype virus [18]. This is possibly because that pseudotyped MERS-CoV, which contains only viral S protein with ability of single-cycle infection but lacks the capability for multiple rounds of replication, might have lower infectivity than wildtype MERS-CoV that contains all viral proteins necessary for virus replication.",

Similar phenomena were observed by Pohlmann and the colleagues, showing that the lentiviral pseudotype had a lower infectivity in DPP4-expressing A549 and that 293T cells from different batches maintained variant infectivities [9]. Reports have shown that HEK cells with undetectable DPP4 had relatively higher infectivity to wildtype MERS-CoV [18]. It may be possible that like SARS-CoV, which has alternative receptors (such as DC-SIGN and/or L-SIGN) in addition to ACE2 [5,19,20], MERS-CoV might also have an alternative receptor that has not been identified so far.",

However, to carry out this type of inhibition assay, it is necessary to utilize biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities. Unfortunately, this strict condition is often inconvenient and cannot be accessed by many researchers. In contrast, our pseudovirus-based inhibition assay can be performed without the requirement of BSL-3 laboratories, considerably simplifying the detection of neutralizing antibodies, as this method does not involve live viruses and is, therefore, safe to carry out [10,23]. Moreover, we demonstrated consistency of neutralization results between the live virus-based inhibition assay and the established pseudovirus-based inhibition assay. These neutralizing results are also consistent with those obtained from the experiments on antisera of mice immunized by another RBD fragment containing residues 358\u2013588 of MERS-CoV S protein, as reported recently [24]. The above results suggest a viable alternative for the rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV natural infection and the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines when BSL-3 facilities are not available. Furthermore, in the absence of BSL-3 facilities, the pseudovirus-based inhibition assay provides a convenient and reliable way to rapidly screen compound- or peptide-based MERS-CoV entry inhibitors to test neutralizing antibodies. With easy production of pseudovirus, rapid read-out and detection of inhibition, this method is particularly suitable for handling a large variety of samples in a short period of time.",
