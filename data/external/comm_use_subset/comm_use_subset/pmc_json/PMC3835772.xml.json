These unusual events are referred to as \u201crecoding\u201d [1, 2]. Two of the major recoding mechanisms are programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) and stop codon readthrough. These mechanisms are utilized by retroviruses and some other RNA viruses to express their structural and enzymatic proteins at a defined ratio [1, 3\u20135]. Both \u22121 frameshifting and stop codon readthrough are site specific and occur at a defined frequency much higher than the background error rates of maintaining the reading frames.",

            "text": "The discovery of the \u22121 PRF mechanism was made by Atkins and coworkers [6], and the utilization of this recoding mechanism by viruses was described as a strategy by which Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) expresses its gag-pol polyprotein from the overlapping gag and pol open reading frames from a single translation initiation codon of the 5\u2032gag reading frame [7]. In \u22121 frameshifting, only a defined percentage of the translating ribosomes shifts to the \u22121 reading frame and translates the downstream gene. This percentage is referred to as the frameshifting efficiency, which dictates the molar ratio of viral structural and enzymatic proteins, encoded by the gag and pol gene, respectively. For efficient \u22121 frameshifting to happen, two cis-acting elements programmed in the overlapping region of the mRNA are often required to signal the translating ribosomes to shift backward by one nucleotide. The first element is a heptanucleotide stretch termed \u201cslippery sequence\u201d with a typical composition of X XXY YYZ (XXX and YYY: a stretch of three identical nucleotides; the triplets indicate the 0 reading frame). Although the slippery sequence is the site of action where the ribosomes actually shift to the \u22121 frame, this element alone is not sufficient to cause efficient shifting. A secondary signal called \u201cstimulator\u201d is usually required in the form of an RNA structure downstream from the frameshift site, separated by a spacer region (typically 6\u20139 nucleotides in length). In some cases, the stimulator is a conventional stem-loop structure, but most often it is a pseudoknot, which is a structural motif of RNA formed when a stretch of nucleotides within a loop region in a secondary structure basepairs with residues outside that loop [8\u201310] (Figure 1). The indispensable role of a downstream pseudoknot in efficient \u22121 frameshifting has been established in a large number of RNA viruses including members from the retroviridae family, coronaviridae family (such as SARS CoV), totiviridae family, and Luteoviridae family [5, 11\u201318]. Although a 3\u2032 RNA structure is utilized as a frameshift stimulator in most cases, absence of such a structure has also been reported in efficient frameshifting such as in the case of Semliki Forest virus [19].",

In the MMTV pseudoknot, L3 consists of an unpaired adenosine that is intercalated between the two stems S1 and S2 thereby inducing a bent conformation of the pseudoknot. In the SRV-1 pseudoknot, L3 is absent, and the two stems S1 and S2 stack coaxially to form a quasi-continuous helix. The luteoviral pseudoknots are small and compact (with only 4-5 basepairs in S1 and 3 basepairs in S2). Extensive S1-L2 and S2-L1 interactions are present in all of the luteoviral pseudoknots. Overall, the available structures do not share common structural feature(s) other than the fact that they all adopt the general pseudoknotted topology. These results indicate that the frameshift stimulating ability of a pseudoknot is not dependent on its specific or unique structural feature(s). Several lines of evidence suggest that the thermodynamic stability and mechanical strength of a frameshift stimulating pseudoknot to resist unwinding by the helicase activity of the ribosome may correlate more strongly with frameshift stimulation.",

In a low resolution (~16 \u00c5) structure, obtained by cryoelectron microscopy, of mammalian 80S ribosome in complex with the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) pp1a/pp1b pseudoknot frameshift signal, as well as eEF2 occupying the A-site and a tRNA occupying the P-site [35], it is found that the paused pseudoknot is stuck at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel of the ribosome, and the D-helix of the P-site tRNA bends heavily toward the 3\u2032 direction (compared to a structure with nonframeshift stimulating stem-loop RNA). The opposing forces placed by translocation and the wedged pseudoknot may create local tension on the mRNA, which can be relaxed by frameshifting. The superior ability of pseudoknots to pause ribosomes is presumably due to the unique pseudoknotted topology. The presence of stem2 greatly limits the rotational freedom of stem1, making the pseudoknots harder to unwind by the translating ribosomes than simple stem\u2013loop structures with comparable thermodynamic stability [36].

The requirement for extra energy input may explain why the pseudoknot is more resistant to unfolding by optical tweezers (presumably by ribosomes as well). The mechanical strength of pseudoknots was further correlated with the frameshift stimulating ability of the pseudoknots [37, 38]. By extrapolating the data, it was proposed that pseudoknots with certain mechanical strength would be able to stimulate \u22121 frameshifting of 100% efficiency, and pseudoknots with even higher mechanical strength would stall the ribosomes completely like a roadblock (with or without frameshifting), leading to translation termination [38].

By investigating a number of designed pseudoknots with varied numbers of basepairs in the stems, it was shown that the strongest pseudoknots (as predicted) only induced limited frameshifting, as judged by the amount of full-length frameshifted products. However, analysis of the pulse labeled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes did shift frames but failed to pass the pseudoknot structures to continue translation; the strength of the pseudoknots correlated not only with the fraction of frameshifted ribosomes but also the roadblocking effect. Based on these observations, it was proposed that the optimal frameshifting efficiency would be produced when a balance of the two effects is achieved. According to this hypothesis, the naturally occurring frameshift stimulating pseudoknots should have optimal mechanical strength to cause the right amount of translating ribosomes to shift frames but should not be too strong in order to ensure that the ribosomes are not stalled permanently. It is also implied that strong pseudoknots that exhibit a roadblocking effect should not be present in the coding regions of mRNAs.",

Are there strong roadblocking pseudoknots in the viral genomic mRNAs? To address these questions, we have developed a computer program capable of identifying potential H-type pseudoknots in any given mRNA sequence and ranking the identified pseudoknots according to the relative strength of their helical stems.

Some of these potential pseudoknots have overlapped pseudoknot-forming sequences; that is, two or more potential pseudoknots are mutually excluded and cannot exit at the same time. After eliminating overlapped pseudoknots with higher free energy, the number of potential pseudoknots in the SRV-1 genomic mRNA decreases to 31.

The involvement of the LV and LDV pseudoknots in efficient frameshifting was established [44, 45]. The pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV are comparable to each other in terms of the lengths of the spacer region, S1, S2, L1, and L3, and the calculated stem free energies. The lengths of L2 are more varied. The length of L2 in EAV (68 nt) is substantially longer than those in other viruses of this family. Interestingly, we find that this L2 sequence harbours a potential pseudoknot with 31 nt (Figure 2). This pseudoknot seems very credible because it is very similar to the structurally well characterized T2 bacteriophage gene 32 mRNA autoregulatory pseudoknot [46] and the SRV-1 gag-pro frameshift stimulating pseudoknot [24, 25]. Moreover, this potential pseudoknot, when placed in an \u201cup-side-down\u201d orientation, stacks just right on top of the stem1 of the frameshifting pseudoknot. Stacking of the four stem regions of the two pseudoknots creates a quasi-continuous double helix of 28 basepairs in length. The slippery sequence in EAV (G UUA AAC) is somewhat deviated from the consensus slippery sequence of X XXY YYZ found in most other viruses. Whether the elaborate arrangement of pseudoknots in EAV plays any role in regulating frameshifting efficiency, and if it does, whether it is related to the \u201catypical\u201d slippery sequence, await further investigations. All of the frameshift stimulating pseudoknots in EAV, LV, LDV, and PRRSV rank first among all of the potential pseudoknots identified within the full-length genomic RNAs. ",

Importantly, our approach of pseudoknot detection was not restricted to a limited sequence window downstream from the known frameshift or readthrough recoding sites.

As shown in Table 1, in ~78% of the viruses, the pseudoknot detected downstream from the frameshift or readthrough site rank 1st or 2nd among all possible pseudoknots within the genome. The pseudoknot with the lowest free energy (\u221248.7 kcal/mol) in Table 1 is found in Lelystad virus. The detected pseudoknot downstream from the pro-pol framshift site in HTLV-I/STLV-I (Figure 2, not listed in Table 1) has an even lower free energy of \u221254.2 kcal/mol. This pseudoknot is the most stable pseudoknot among all the possible pseudoknots (regardless of locations of the pseudoknots within the viral genomes) detected in this study. In comparison, the artificial strong pseudoknots that can act as ribosomal roadblocks described in a previous study [40] has a calculated free energy of \u221273.9 kcal/mol (22 bp in S1 and 6 bp in S2). Apparently, the frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknots in a lot of viruses have evolved to become the most stable pseudoknot within the viral genomic mRNAs; but at the same time they are not too strong. These pseudoknots seem to have optimal stability to stimulate the right amount of frameshifting and readthrough and subsequently be unfolded by the translating ribosomes. In other viruses in which the detected frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknot ranks lower or no pseudoknot is detected downstream from the frameshift site, the most stable potential pseudoknots all have a calculated free energy value higher than the putative pro-pol framshift stimulator pseudoknot in HTLV-I/STLV-I. These results clearly show that the viral genomic mRNAs do not contain ultra-stable \u201croadblocking\u201d pseudoknots that would significantly stall ribosomes and might induce no-go decay of the mRNAs [40, 62].

A typical CPK-1 pseudoknot has a S2 of 6-7 base pairs and a very short L1 of 1-2 nucleotides; L3 is absent therefore the two helical stems S1 and S2 can stack to form a quasicontinuous helix. An inspection of the detected frameshift or readthrough stimulator pseudoknots reveals that more than 40% of these pseudoknots conform to the CPK-1 family (Table 1). The alternative tandem pseudoknots (Figure 3. Not listed in Table 1) in HIV1 and the elaborated pseudoknot in EAV (Figure 2) also conform to the CPK-1 family. Interestingly, it was found that the founding member of the CPK-1 family, a pseudoknot in gene 32 mRNA of bacteriophage T2 whose natural biological function is translational autoregulation, was unable to serve as a frameshift stimulator [63]. Most likely, the common features defined by the CPK-1 motif may primarily serve a structural role for maintaining a stable and compact pseudoknotted scaffold upon which diverse biological functions can build on, presumably mainly by the more variable parts of the pseudoknots, including S1 & L2, and possible interactions between them.",

This theory provides a very good explanation for the frequent utilization of CPK-1 type pseudoknots in various viruses. It is clear that while a large number of detected pseudoknots conform to the CPK-1 family, the lengths and compositions of S1 and L2 of these pseudoknots show a fair degree of variations, especially when viruses from different groups are compared. Moreover, additional features could be added to the \u201cbasic\u201d CPK-1 pseudoknot fold (such as seen in the EAV, HCV229E and SARS pseudoknots) which would make the pseudoknots even more versatile in fine-tuning the frameshifting.",

These pseudoknots sample a wide range of stem and loop sizes, as well as the presence or absence of an intervening sequence (L3). Given the wide range of sequences studied, it is not particularly surprising to observe all these variations associated with the detected pseudoknots. Since different viruses (especially viruses that are remote in evolution) may have different requirements for certain level of frameshifting efficiency, variations in the frameshifting pseudoknots, as well as the slippery sequences and spacers, may be necessary for the fine-tuning of the frameshifting efficiency to meet the specific need of different viruses.

It was also shown that a sequence downstream from the originally proposed stem-loop also contributed to frameshifting, either modelled as an intramolecular triplex [69] or an extended bulged stem-loop [70]. In HIV-1 strain MVP5180 from subgroup O, a very classic H-type pseudoknot locating 8nt downstream from the gag-pol frameshift site was shown to be required for stimulating a higher frameshifting efficiency than that in group M [71].

In HIV-1 (HXB2), two mutually excluded potential pseudoknots were detected downstream from the slippery sequence (Figure 3), one with no spacer and the other with a normal length spacer. Intriguingly, another pseudoknot that contains the slippery sequence is detected. This pseudoknot can stack on top of the pseudoknot immediately downstream from the slippery sequence. Given such an elaborated arrangement of tandem pseudoknots (both belonging to the CPK-1 family) and another mutually excluded pseudoknot at the HIV-1 gag-pol frameshift junction, we asked ourselves this question: can we come up with a reasonable hypothesis about the PRF mechanisms in this case that would explain the possible involvement of these pseudoknots?

            "text": " The answer is: yes we can. Let us assume that the tandem pseudoknots are present at the gag-pol frameshift junction (due to its lower free energy compared to the alternative pseudoknot). These pseudoknots can significantly slow down the translating ribosome when the pseudoknots are being unwound by the ribosome. When the ribosome scans through the unwound mRNA sequence and is approaching the slippery sequence, the top pseudoknot is fully unwound and the stem1 of the bottom pseudoknot should also be disrupted. Stem2 of the bottom pseudoknot remains intact. The six basepairs of this stem2 are actually the same as the first six basepairs in stem1 of the mutually excluded pseudoknot (Figure 3). Now that the tandem pseudoknots are unwound, the alternative pseudoknot can form rapidly (because a large portion of its stem1 is already in place). The newly formed pseudoknot, with an optimal spacer from the slippery sequence, jams the entrance of the mRNA tunnel of the ribosome. This novel mechanism of PRF elegantly explains the results from our bioinformatic study and is consistent with current paradigm of PRF mechanism. Equilibrium of relevant alternative RNA structures has been shown to play a functional role in the regulation of read-through efficiency in murine leukaemia virus, suggesting a general involvement of equilibrium-based mechanism in translational recoding [72]. We plan to carry out a large scale analysis on the several thousand sequences for different strains of HIV1 viruses to assess the degree of conservation on the putative PRF signals.",

Second, the frameshift or readthrough stimulating pseudoknots in most viruses are among the most stable pseudoknots within the viral genomic mRNAs. The stabilities of these pseudoknots have been fine-tuned during evolution to be optimal for the decoding events. Third, pseudoknots of the CPK-1 family occur most frequently. The favorable CPK-1 scaffold can accommodate significant variations (especially in the stem1 and loop2 regions) which are presumably important for the fine-tuning of framshift or readthrough stimulating ability of the pseudoknots. Fourth, some HIV1 viruses may utilize a novel mechanism that involves three pseudoknots to regulate the frameshift efficiency at the gag-pol junction. Results from this study also prove the usefulness of our pseudoknot-detecting program. Since this is a general-purpose program that can identify all possible pseudoknots in a long RNA sequence, we expect that the program will find its application in some other related studies such as identifying potential cases of pseudoknot-dependent \u22121 PRF in cellular genes.",
