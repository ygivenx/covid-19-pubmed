Neonatal neuro-developmental follow up (NNFU) clinics were designed for effective monitoring and assessment of these infants at regular time intervals. Regular attendance at scheduled appointments by children with their parents or care givers and sensitive feedback of the assessment to the family are important factors in early prediction of neuro-developmental delay in high risk infants [6].",

            "text": "The validity of using the parent completed ASQ system as an alternative approach to evaluate developmental outcome has been extensively evaluated [19-22] and has the advantage of being a cost-effective and simple screening tool for long term follow up of preterm high risk infants [23]. Some literature has suggested that parents may be unable to complete questionnaires satisfactorily due to reading, organizational, mental health and cognitive disabilities [19]. A limitation of this study is that we did not obtain socio-economic data of the parents as a determinant of the rate of ASQ reply and the accuracy of reporting developmental delay in their infants. It has been previously shown [24] however that the accuracy of parent reporting is not influenced by socio-demographic factors or maternal educational level. A further limitation is the potential difference in populations between the SARS and non-SARS groups as they were recruited in different time periods which may have affected the accuracy of our result. Future studies may compare alternative assessment types at the same time period.",

If there is no a priori planning there is a risk of inconsistent patient management as was illustrated here. This applies not only to NNFU clinics but to all clinics providing care for patients with chronic health conditions. Well planned mail and telephone contact may be of assistance in providing patient care during the time of infectious disease containment measures particularly if staff is deployed to work in other areas. Such contact may also help with maintaining the engagement of families and return to clinic. Consideration should be given for remuneration of physician and other health care providers for this telephone assessment. If staffing was adequate a telehealth or internet based [25] assessment may be more appropriate to diagnose certain types of conditions. After the crisis has passed, workload adjustments may be required to enable rapid rescheduling of face to face assessments. These reflections are timely in view of the current focus of hospitals and public health authorities' planning for anticipated influenza pandemics. In conclusion, non-urgent care clinics should have a priori planning for identification, contacting and assessment of their high risk patients during the periods of clinic closure due to infectious diseases outbreaks.",
