In humans, Marburg virus disease (MVD) typically begins with high fever accompanied by a severe headache, chills, myalgia and malaise. For many patients, this is followed by abdominal pain, severe nausea, vomiting and watery diarrhea. After about 5 days, more than 75% of the patients develop some form of hemorrhagic manifestation such as mucosal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, hematemesis, and ecchymosis [2]. Later stages of the disease can manifest in multiorgan failure, shock, and coma. Acute liver failure, with concomitant increases in liver-associated enzymes, is a common disease manifestation [3]. Case fatality rates can approach 90%, with death typically occurring 8\u201316 days following the onset of symptoms [1,2].",

This threat has been exemplified by the occurrence of two large outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1998\u20132000 and in Angola in 2004\u20132005, which together resulted in greater than 400 cases with more than 350 deaths [1]. MARV is closely related to the Ebola virus and there is the possibility of larger outbreaks similar to the current Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa.",

            "text": "The MARV genome is negative-sense, single stranded RNA of approximately 19 kb encoding seven genes including NP (nucleoprotein), VP35 (polymerase cofactor), VP40 (matrix protein), GP (glycoprotein), VP30 (transcription activator), VP24 (secondary matrix protein) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein). These genes and their products represent potential targets for the development of therapeutic agents. There are currently no licensed vaccines or antiviral therapies for MARV infection, although several approaches are actively being pursued for postexposure therapeutic interventions. Daddario-DiCaprio et al. showed the first complete postexposure protection of nonhuman primates against MARV infection using a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector expressing the MARV GP [4]. However, the construct was given just 20\u201330 min after viral challenge and safety and efficacy of this therapeutic modality in human subjects remains unproven. Postexposure administration of recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2, a strategy designed to mitigate coagulopathy seen in severe MARV infections, failed to provide substantive protection of infected monkeys [5]. Recent studies using liposome formulated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the NP gene of MARV in guinea pig and nonhuman primate models are promising [6,7]. In addition, studies have demonstrated the importance of the MARV NP gene in both viral assembly [8] and viral RNA synthesis [9], highlighting the critical role the NP gene plays in the life cycle of the MARV.",

            "text": "Antisense oligomers, such as AVI-7288, are synthetic molecules designed to interfere with the translation of gene products by sterically blocking mRNA resulting in the inhibition of gene expression [10]. AVI-7288 is designed to prevent viral replication by binding to NP mRNA in a sequence-specific manner, thus sterically blocking translation. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are uncharged antisense compounds composed of moieties with 6-sided morpholino bases linked by phosphorodiamidate linkages, as opposed to a ribose base as in RNA, linked through methylene phosphorodiamidate. PMOs are attractive as antiviral agents due to their metabolic stability, and bioavailability [11,12]. PMOs and peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMO) have been shown to inhibit the replication of Ebola virus [13,14], coxsackievirus B3 [15], influenza A virus [16,17], alphaviruses [18], vesiviruses [19], dengue virus [20], and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [21]. In a previous report, we introduced a new class of positively-charged PMO (PMOplus) containing piperazine linkages within the molecular backbone and containing a limited number (between 2 and 5) of positive charges [14]. The positive charges may enhance both cellular penetration and avidity to the negatively charged RNA target sequence of the virus. We previously showed that administration of PMOplus, in a combination therapy containing antisense agents targeting NP and VP24 of MARV, provided 100% protection of cynomolgus macaques when given 30\u201360 min after infection [22]. Subsequently, we showed that a single agent designated AVI-7288, targeting the NP of MARV, was as effective as the combination therapy [23]. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of AVI-7288 alone in cynomolgus macaques in a delayed time-to-treatment study in which the PMOplus was administered 1, 24, 48, or 96 h following infection with MARV.",

A recent report demonstrated post-exposure treatment protection of rhesus monkeys from MARV-Angola strain with treatment delay up to 3 days [7]. AVI-7288 has previously been shown to be highly effective in providing survival benefit in cynomolgus macaques infected with the Musoke strain of MARV, however, the PMOplus therapy in these experimental studies began on the day of infection [23]. In contrast, a treatment regimen for infected humans would usually need to be initiated in a longer post infection time period. Hence, it is important to determine the potential benefit of AVI-7288 when initiation of treatment is significantly delayed after infection. Thus, the primary objective of this study was to determine the survival benefit provided by AVI-7288 when initially administered up to four days after infection with the Musoke strain of MARV, utilizing the cynomolgus macaque animal model.",

Furthermore, differences in survival between groups receiving AVI-7288 treatments at different times PI were not statistically distinguishable. Two of the three AVI-7288 treated animals (0197 in the 24 h group and 9172 in the 96 h group) that succumbed to infection were slow to mount an IgG immune response (1:30 and 1:270 titers, respectively). However, a low IgG titer was not adequate to provide a reliable marker of survival as several of the survivors had low IgG titers on day 14 PI. There was no notable relationship between the magnitude or duration of the MARV-specific IgG response and the time of AVI-7288 dosing or macaque survival. Overall, the results of this study indicate that, when administered IV once per day for a total of 14 days, AVI-7288 protects cynomolgus macaques against MARV even when the treatments are initiated as late as 96 h after viral infection.",

One monkey had faint staining for viral antigen in macrophages within foci of inflammation in the thyroid gland. Although it is possible that this is an indication of persistent viral infection in the thyroid, it is more likely that these macrophages contain viral antigen due to phagocytosis of cellular debris containing viral antigen. Similarly, another animal had viral antigen in acellular debris within a tonsillar crypt. This probably reflects persistence of isolated viral antigen rather than the presence of intact, viable viral particles. However, eight of the male monkeys had testicular lesions with positive viral antigen in the foci of testicular inflammation; this might indicate that these macaques had persistent MARV infections at the time of their deaths. This is consistent with findings in humans who died of MARV during the original 1967 outbreak in which autopsy revealed large necrotic lesions in the testicles [29]. Furthermore, a man who survived MARV infection during this outbreak is believed to have infected his wife via sexual contact more than 6 weeks after his clinical recovery and viable MARV was subsequently recovered from his seminal samples as late as 16 weeks after his discharge from the hospital [30]. The possibility of venereal transmission may not be confined to MARV; a household contact of an Ebola patient from the 1995 Kikwit outbreak was presumably infected by sexual intercourse and four out of five convalescent patients examined had seminal fluid samples that were PCR positive for Ebola virus [29]. Given the on-going large Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, sexual transmission of the virus is a concern [31]. Interestingly, although eight of the survivor male macaques in this study had MARV antigen in their testicular lesions, none of these tissues yielded viable virus by plaque assay suggesting that the treatment suppressed viral replication in the animals\u2019 testes. Additional research needs to be done to clarify the potential for viral persistence in the testis.",
