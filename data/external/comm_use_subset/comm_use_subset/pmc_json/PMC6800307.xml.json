Non\u2010human primates (NHP) are a highly human\u2010relevant disease model for infectious agents due to high genetic conservation between humans and NHP.1, 2, 3 However, significant cost and ethical issues often necessitate the use of smaller animal models for both basic and translational research. Mice (Mus musculus) are a favoured small animal model due to widespread availability, incisive transgenic models, comprehensive genomic information4 and readily available reagents. However, for many viruses, alternative animal models better recapitulate human physiology and disease. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have been employed to study the pathogenesis of a variety of human pathogens, including human and avian influenzas, coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS\u2010CoV),5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV),15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 human metapneumovirus (HMPV),21 Ebola virus22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and henipavirus (Nipah virus and Hendra virus).29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 While ferrets can be productively infected with many of these viruses, a lack of some tools to interrogate ferret immunological responses to infection limits insights that might impact the development of vaccines and/or therapeutics. Here, we review recent insights gained from ferret models of human respiratory diseases, with a major focus on influenza, and highlight several knowledge gaps whose closure will greatly enhance the informational gain from ferret models to advance development of human vaccines and therapeutics.",

Ferrets are an extremely valuable model for studies on influenza pathogenesis42, 43 and both direct and aerosol transmission.44, 45 Critically, ferrets are a susceptible host for highly pathogenic avian strains of influenza with pandemic potential, such as H5N1 and H7N9, although disease severity in infected ferrets is somewhat variable.42, 46, 47, 48 Similar variability in pathogenesis has been reported for some seasonal strains such as recent H3N2 isolates,49, 50 which display a range of disease severity in humans51 but generally remain mild in ferrets.52, 53\n",

Currently licensed seasonal vaccines, historically trivalent (TIV) but increasingly quadrivalent inactivated vaccines (QIV), can protect both ferrets56, 57 and humans58, 59 from infection and disease.

The utility of such cross\u2010reactive reagents has been shown experimentally. For example, prime\u2010boost immunisation using DNA and adenoviral\u2010based influenza vaccines provided effective protection in experimentally challenged ferrets, with protection correlating to the capacity of CD3+ T cells to express interferon gamma (IFN\u2010\u03b3) following in vitro stimulation on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HA peptide pools.92 Caution should be taken when using antibodies developed for other species in ferret experiments, as there may be subsets of cells displaying variable reactivity to the antibodies.105, 106 In addition, currently available anti\u2010ferret B\u2010cell antibodies such as CD79\u03b1 target intracellular epitopes, requiring fixation and permeabilisation. This limits downstream applications such as RT\u2010PCR or the recovery of antigen\u2010specific immunoglobulin sequences from sorted B cells.

Next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS) has become increasingly important for immunological research and has led to the generation of huge amounts of data and the development of tools for data extraction and analysis. An important aspect of T\u2010 and B\u2010cell research is the immune cell receptor repertoire during an infection and the effects of allelic variation of important immunological molecules such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on host immune responses. A draft copy of the ferret genome is available,62 but genes coding for B\u2010 or T\u2010cell receptors have yet to be fully annotated and validated. Genomic sequencing and assembly of closely related species such as minks143 are also far from complete, though several similarities such as genome size and relative abundance of repeat elements have been found. In comparison, high\u2010quality draft genome assemblies for dogs and cats are available and have been used for genome\u2010wide association studies144 and identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).145 The identification of SNPs in immunoglobulin genes is useful for distinguishing between somatically mutated B\u2010cell receptor sequences and germline variants in affinity\u2010matured antigen\u2010specific B\u2010cell populations. There are currently databases of immunoglobulin sequences for well\u2010established animal models such as those found in the international ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information system database146 and have been useful for identifying somatic hypermutations in immunoglobulin sequences.147 A curated and annotated database of immune gene sequences is a prerequisite for PCR primer design and post\u2010sequencing data analysis used to recover and express antibodies from single\u2010sorted B cells148 and recombinant T\u2010cell receptors.149\n",

Currently, only one IgG subclass that has been identified in ferrets, while four different IgG subclasses have been identified in other carnivores such as dogs154 and minks155 and three in felines,156 suggesting other unidentified ferret IgG subclasses may exist. The diversity and function of ferret Fc receptors are also unknown. Different IgG and Fc receptor subclasses in humans and mice have shown to be important for different antibody\u2010mediated effector functions such as antibody\u2010dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Human Fc gamma receptor IIIa (Fc\u03b3RIIIa; Fc\u03b3RIV in mice) is the main receptor involved in ADCC, and human IgG3 (mouse IgG2a) followed closely by human IgG1 (mouse IgG2b) displays the highest affinities for this receptor. Advanced assays for ADCC and other Fc\u2010mediated responses to influenza have been developed in recent years in both NHP157 and humans.158, 159 Such non\u2010neutralising mechanisms have been shown to be important for broadly protective responses against antigenically distinct strains of influenza157, 160, 161 and development of universal influenza vaccines. Many of the current ADCC and related assays rely on the detection of Ab\u2010mediated activation of NK cells to express cytokines such as IFN\u2010\u03b3 or degranulation markers such as CD107a,162 but there are currently no reagents to differentiate NK cells from other cytotoxic lymphocyte populations such as CD8+ T cells.163 While a ferret\u2010specific T\u2010cell IFN\u2010\u03b3 expression assays164 to measure CD8 T\u2010lymphocyte activation have been developed and validated, the future elucidation of corresponding antibody/Fc receptor ferret orthologues will enable ferrets to be used to evaluate ADCC responses.",

The inability to isolate monoclonal antibodies from ferret B cells has limited studies into the antigenic recognition of influenza proteins in ferrets. Confirming epitope\u2010specific recognition of HA at the monoclonal antibody level in ferrets is critical, as there have been several reports that human and ferret serum antibodies can display variable antigenic recognition.165, 166 This is critically important as antisera from infected ferrets is widely used in HI assays as part of the strain determination process for influenza vaccines.167, 168\n",

For example, neutralising antibodies in adult humans recognised mostly Sb and Sa, while responses in ferrets were mostly directed to Sa.166 Another similar study characterising humoral responses against influenza B (IBV) using reverse\u2010engineered viral mutants showed that the proportion of human antibodies targeting non\u2010canonical antigenic sites of IBV HA are comparable to canonical antigenic sites (120 loop, 150 loop, 160 loop and 190 helix).172 This is in contrast to IBV\u2010specific responses in mice and ferrets, where most serum antibody is directed against canonical antigenic sites only. These results suggest inter\u2010species differences in humoral recognition of the influenza HA. Other studies lend support, with a head\u2010to\u2010head comparison between humans and ferrets immunised or infected with various seasonal H3 vaccine strains showing key differences in serological recognition of viral HA173 based on molecular modelling and antigenic cartography. Similarly, cross\u2010reactive H1N1 antibody responses in ferrets are not predictive of cross\u2010reactive responses in humans,174 confirming fundamental differences in B\u2010cell responses between humans and ferrets.",
