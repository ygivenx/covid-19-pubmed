A virus discovery method to amplify RNA and DNA virus sequences directly in patient material (VIDISCA-454) without prior knowledge of the viral genome sequence has been developed [5]. The resulting DNA library is then subjected to Roche-454 next generation sequencing and this method has been successfully used to identify human coronavirus NL63 [6], a novel HIV-1 subtype [7], and 2 novel parvoviruses in bats [8].",

Subsequently, second strand DNA synthesis was performed with 5 U of Klenow fragment (Westburg). Double-stranded DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and digested with Mse I restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs). Adaptors with different Multiplex Identifier sequences (MIDs) were ligated to the digested fragments of the different samples. Next, a PCR with adaptor-binding primers was performed. After purification (Agencourt AMPure XP PCR, Beckman Coulter), the purified DNA was quantified with the Quant-it dsDNA HS Qubit kit (Invitrogen) and diluted to 107 ng/\u00b5l. Samples were pooled and Kapa PCR (Kapa Biosystems) was performed to determine the quantity of amplifiable DNA in each pool. Subsequently, the Bioanalyser (hsDNA chip, Agencourt) was used to determine the average nucleotide length of the libraries and the pools were diluted until 106 copies/\u00b5l to be used for a titration (DNA:beads ratio of 0.5\u22361, 1\u22361, 2\u22361 and 4\u22361) in an emulsion PCR according to the suppliers\u2019 protocol (LIB-A SV emPCR kit).
