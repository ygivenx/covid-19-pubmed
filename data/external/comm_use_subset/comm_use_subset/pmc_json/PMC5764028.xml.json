They often have a larger vulnerability to infections because of limited prior immunity, and they mix at school with high contact rates [4] thus representing key drivers for influenza spread. The closure of school has been associated to the potential of reducing influenza propagation in the community by breaking important chains of transmission. It is expected to potentially delay the peak, and reduce the epidemic impact, at peak time and of the overall wave. Though not specifically recommended by the World Health Organization during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it is envisioned as a possible non-pharmaceutical intervention for pandemic mitigation left to the decision of national and local authorities [5, 6].",

Benefits and limitations appear to depend on the specific epidemic context. For example, influenza epidemics characterized by a larger attack rate in children compared to adults are expected to be more sensitive to the closure of schools [9]. This experience was reported in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, where closed schools coincided with a marked reduction of influenza activity [10\u201322]. School closure interventions are often considered along with other mitigation strategies, as it happened with social distancing in Mexico following the pandemic outbreak [15, 23], making their effect more difficult to isolate. Studies generally report a slowing down effect in the incidence during closure, however in some cases the effect may be mixed with the natural decline of the epidemic, because of late implementation [8]. In addition, no clear trend is observed in the impact of school closure on the epidemic burden depending on the time of closure \u2013 before, around, or after the peak [8].",

For the latter, regular school closure during holidays in temperate regions has been considered as a natural example to evaluate the impact of school closure [24\u201326]. Directly extending the application to pandemic situations has however important limitations. Closure associated to winter holidays is regularly scheduled in the school calendar, whereas school closure as an intervention corresponds to an unplanned interruption of school attendance that may take different forms (e.g. proactive vs. reactive, at the national or local level, with a gradual closure of classes or of the entire school) [7, 27\u201329]. In addition to the different nature of closure, also its duration changes from a fixed scheduled period of holidays to one of variable extension depending on the ongoing epidemic and resulting outcome. How individual behavior changes in all these conditions is the critical aspect to quantify in order to accurately assess the impact of school closure on transmission.",

Few of them are based on estimates for social mixing changes [20, 30], as data collected during a pandemic are limited [30, 31], leaving other approaches to rely on assumptions about contacts that may critically affect the studies\u2019 findings. Applications to seasonal influenza may on the other hand count on a more accurate description of population mixing. Surveys conducted over the calendar year to measure variations of mixing patterns [32\u201335] offer indeed the opportunity to perform data-driven modeling studies that mechanistically assess the role of school holidays on seasonal influenza. Interestingly, they also highlighted considerably large differences across countries in the way contacts change from term-time to school holidays [32], suggesting the need for country-specific estimates to accurately and reliably parameterize models.",

Three modeling studies were developed so far with similar objectives. Towers and Chowell studied the impact of day-of-week variations in human social contact patterns on incidence data collected at a large hospital in Santiago, Chile, during 2009 H1N1pdm [49]. Their approach was not spatial, therefore did not consider mobility changes, and mainly focused on the sensitivity of influenza incidence variations to the latency period. Apolloni et al. used a stylized analytical approach to evaluate the role of age-dependent social mixing and travel behavior on the conditions for epidemic spatial invasion [20]. The model can compare different contexts, with or without schools in terms, and also account for associated changes. The contexts are however considered independently (no full school calendar can be considered) and the epidemic impact is evaluated only in terms of conditions for spatial dissemination. Going beyond these limitations, more recently Ewing et al. introduced an age-specific spatial metapopulation model to evaluate how behavioral changes associated to winter holiday impact the flu season [48]. The model is applied to the United States and it integrates data on travel behavior, whereas mixing is assumed from estimates available from Europe and adapted to summer holiday changes measured in the UK during the 2009 pandemic [30]. Their findings identify changes in mixing patterns as the key element responsible for the epidemic effects induced by holidays.",

The aim is to reduce assumptions in favor of input data, and to exclusively focus on seasonal influenza and associated parameterization. Contact data associated to four types of calendar days are considered, belonging to Regular Weekday, Regular Weekend, Holiday Weekday, Holiday Weekend (here \u2018regular\u2019 refers to non-holiday period), allowing us to assess the role of weekends in addition to holidays. A richer calendar with additional holidays beyond Christmas break is also considered. Confirming and extending prior results with a different modeling approach and input data would greatly support our understanding of the role of changes in mixing and travel on influenza epidemics.",

The result is a spatially heterogeneous propagation where the two ingredients act at different levels. Mixing is patch-dependent and determined by the local demography. The large variations observed in the distribution of children vs. adults lead to heterogeneous distributions of the values of the reproductive numbers per patch. In specific mixing conditions \u2013 e.g. those of a holiday weekend \u2013 a large fraction of patches has Rp\u22431, indicating that those locations are found to be close to the critical conditions for epidemic extinction. Influenza is mainly sustained in patches having larger Rp during those periods, and epidemic activity is then transferred to other patches through the mobility of infected individuals. Three-fourth of Belgian districts reach their epidemic peak in the simulations within one week of the empirical peak time. Districts exhibiting greater delays lie on the border of the country. This may be due to the model neglecting the mobility coupling between these regions and the neighboring countries, which is considerably large in some districts (e.g. the flux of individuals of the Luxembourg province commuting abroad represents almost 40% of the total flux of commuters of the district). Our study considered the country to be isolated for the sake of simplicity. We expect this border effect to be increasingly negligible for larger countries.",

This was also found in previous empirical studies [25, 48]. To identify the mechanisms behind this effect, we isolated the changes in mixing and those in travel behavior during school closure, comparing different experimental scenarios, similar to Ewing et al. [48]. We found that mixing changes during weekends and holidays lead to a considerable delay of the epidemic, whereas travel changes would produce no noticeable effect. Moreover, changes in the social contacts would explain the entire difference observed between the realistic model based on the calendar and a model that does not include school closure. This confirms prior modeling findings on winter holidays for several influenza seasons in the United States [48]. In contrast to that work, we found however that an important mitigation of the epidemic impact at peak time also occurs, besides the peak delay.",

This mainly results from the reduction of the number of contacts between children, as measured by the social contact survey conducted once schools are closed [32]. Travel changes, on the other hand, do not act directly on the transmission potential but affect the coupling force between epidemics in different patches and the opportunity for individuals to be exposed to the disease. For this reason, changes in travel behavior have a smaller effect that is found to be negligible for influenza epidemic spread, as also observed in the work of [48]. This is also consistent with the large literature on travel restrictions showing the little or no effect that these interventions have on pandemic spatial spread [38\u201340, 44, 46, 73, 76\u201378]. In addition to holidays, we also found that the closure of school during weekends has a visible effect on the epidemic, periodically dampening transmission, similarly to what observed in [49]. This is generally not reported by influenza surveillance systems, as data are collected on a weekly basis.",

If the school break occurs earlier (as for the Fall holiday) or much later in the influenza season (e.g. Easter holiday), no effect is produced on the resulting epidemic.

By systematically exploring this interplay through synthetic scenarios, we confirm the importance of Christmas holiday in mitigating the influenza epidemic. Most importantly, we found that the break would have the largest impact for a very early season when school closing would occur at or around the epidemic peak. Reduction in transmission due to fewer contacts leads to a strong reduction of the incidence and ultimately of the total epidemic size, as also observed in pandemic settings [8]. In the other synthetic influenza seasons explored, a rebound effect was obtained when schools reopened after the break, most notably for the early season anticipating of two weeks the 2008/2009 influenza epidemic (-2w model). This was previously observed in other contexts [23, 24, 79\u201384], also when no additional interventions beyond school closure were considered [24, 80]. The various tested scenarios show that Christmas break would have a larger mitigating impact if it occurs before (or around) the peak and when the incidence is about half the peak value or larger.",

We chose this break as it led to the largest epidemic impact in our case study, and also because it generally occurs before the influenza epidemic peak (this is the case for all influenza seasons from the studied seasons to the current one, pandemic season excluded). As such, we expect it could have a favorable impact on the epidemic outcome in the majority of influenza seasons. Previous work analyzing the length of school closure found that two weeks or more appear to be enough to result in a recognizable effect [14, 24, 25, 80, 84], whereas shorter closures may not be beneficial or may not have an obvious impact [85\u201389]. Our synthetic results show that the extension would be advantageous only if implemented after the Christmas break, with a mitigation of the peak incidence and a minimal peak delay of a few days. Extensions are generally considered in the realm of reactive closures against a pandemic influenza. Here we decided to test this scenario as a regular closure given that \u2013 in a broader context \u2013 authorities in Belgium are currently discussing whether to modify the school calendar for pedagogical reasons: the aim would be to reduce summer holidays and redistribute holiday periods throughout the year [90].

            "text": "Our findings are obtained on seasonal influenza, and results on peak delay were also recovered by modeling works on synthetic influenza pandemics considering reactive school closure [17]. The straightforward extension of our conclusions to the pandemic case faces however several challenges. First, effects induced by school closure may be specific to the specific epidemic profile, and therefore they may lead to different results depending on the pandemic under consideration [7]. For example, beneficial effects of school closure during 2009 H1N1 pandemic may have resulted from the larger magnitude of children attack rates vs. adults. Epidemic contexts more homogeneously impacting age classes may be less affected by school closure. Second, the nature of the school closure may alter the behavior of individuals during that period. In our study we considered holidays that are regularly planned in the school calendar and associated to specific social activities (e.g. vacation trips, family visits and others), for which contact data are available [32]. School closure during an influenza pandemic may be envisioned as a proactive or reactive measure to the ongoing outbreak. Not being planned, it is expected to have a stronger disruptive impact on social mixing of individuals on the short term compared to regular closure. On the other hand, it is argued that prolonged closure may limit the reduction of contacts on the long term, because of costs and logistics, and reduction in compliance rate [7, 25]. Having shown here that changes in social mixing represent the single element critically responsible for the impact of school closure on the epidemic outcome, we note that modeling results on school closure in the case of a pandemic would strongly be affected by assumptions considered for mixing changes, in absence of data.",

            "text": "While a large body of literature has recently focused on behavioral changes during an epidemic [91\u201395], still little is known to quantify them [30\u201334, 96\u201399]. Our work focused on Belgium, as a rather detailed survey was conducted in the country to estimate contact rates in the population of different age classes at different periods of the calendar year [32]. These estimates constituted the input data to parameterize our spatial modeling framework. Modeling approaches to study epidemics in settings where no data exist are often based on the assumption that mixing would reduce following school closure and import estimates available from other settings or epidemiological contexts [17, 28, 48]. This may lead to several issues. Contacts and their changes along the calendar may be country-specific [4], thus affecting epidemic results when applied to a different context. Estimates of the overall reduction of the number of contacts during school closure vary widely. Transmission models fitted to epidemic data estimated reductions ranging from 16-18% for holidays during seasonal influenza in France [25], to 25% in Hong Kong for proactive school closure during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [14], to 30% for the social distancing interventions (including school closure) implemented in Mexico following the start of 2009 pandemic [15]. A large-scale population-based prospective survey in Europe estimated the changes in contact patterns for holiday versus regular period to correspond to a reduction in the reproductive number as high as 33% for some countries, whereas for others no significant decrease was observed [32]. Finally, such overall reduction does not allow to fully parametrize a contact matrix. Such evidence does not support the parameterization of mixing changes from different countries and/or epidemic situations (e.g. seasonal vs. pandemic) [48]. The reduction is expected to be heterogeneous across mixing groups, because of compensatory behaviors (e.g. children drastically reduce children-children contacts but increase children-adults contacts during holidays) [32, 34]. Assumptions on the relative role of specific age classes in absence of data may lead to biases in the modeled epidemic outcome, especially for epidemics reporting large differences in attack rates in children vs. adults. Our work highlights the need to expand our knowledge on contacts and associated changes induced by social activity or by the epidemic itself, in order to better parameterize models and provide reliable and accurate results for epidemic management.",

While a larger heterogeneity is known for the distribution of contacts across age classes [4], our approach still accounts for the major role of children vs. adults in the spread of the disease. Moreover, the validation analysis shows that considering children and adults and the associated mixing and travel behavior is enough to reproduce the spatio-temporal unfolding of the epidemic to a good accuracy. Also, we did not distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Santermans et al.

Also, we argue that the main effect behind the observed impact is in the interplay between the incidence profile and holidays timing, all other aspects being equal. To fully assess this aspect, we systematically explored earlier and later epidemics than the 2008/2009 season, thus synthetically accounting for other (similar) influenza seasons. We did not consider age-specific susceptibility, as it was largely addressed for example in studies related to the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic [101].

This may help the management of epidemics and lessen the pressure on the public health infrastructure. The effect is due to both school holidays and weekend closures, the latter periodically dampening transmission. Variations in travel behavior do not lead instead to visible effects. The observed impact strongly depends on the timing of the school closure, and to a lesser extent on its duration. Christmas holiday is the school break generally playing the most important role in mitigating the epidemic course, though variations are observed depending on the influenza season (e.g. early vs. late epidemic). The addition of one week extension after Christmas holiday may represent an additional strategy to further delay the epidemic peak and mitigate its impact.",
