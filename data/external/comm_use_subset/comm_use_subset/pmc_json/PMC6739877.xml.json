They replicate on host derived membranous vesicles that are induced following viral infection, the formation of which requires the activity of key membrane bound viral enzymes (Altan-Bonnet, 2017). Within the membrane bound viral replication complex, translation of the viral genome and the synthesis of new viral RNA occurs in a highly coordinated process. Positive sense RNA viruses have evolved novel gene expression mechanisms that enable them to overcome the genome size limitations that accompany error-prone replication and which might restrict their overall coding capacity (Firth and Brierley, 2012). In addition, viral modification of the host cell translation machinery often provides a competitive advantage allowing for the efficient translation of viral RNA in an environment where competing cellular RNAs are in abundance (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017). This ability to compete with cellular RNAs is particularly important for the initiation of infection where the incoming viral genome may be present at only a single copy per cell.",

They are also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised; individuals with genetic immune-deficiencies, cancer patients undergoing treatment and transplant recipients often experience chronic norovirus infections lasting months to years (van Beek et al., 2017). The economic impact of HuNoV is estimated to be at least ~$4.2 billion in direct health care costs, with wider societal costs of ~$60 billion (Bartsch et al., 2016). Despite their socioeconomic impact, we have, until very recently lacked a detailed understanding of much of the norovirus life cycle and many significant questions remain unanswered. HuNoV replicons (Chang et al., 2006), a murine norovirus that replicates in cell culture (Karst et al., 2003; Wobus et al., 2004) and the recent B cell (Jones et al., 2014), stem-cell derived organoid (Ettayebi et al., 2016) and zebrafish larvae infection models (Van et al., 2019), have all provided invaluable tools to dissect the norovirus life cycle. However, due to the technical limitations associated with many of these experimental systems, in comparison to other positive sense RNA viruses, our knowledge of the intracellular life of noroviruses is significantly lacking (reviewed in Thorne and Goodfellow, 2014).",

In addition, the norovirus VPg proteins contain a highly conserved C-terminal domain which we have shown to be necessary and sufficient for binding to the translation initiation factor eIF4G via an interaction that requires a highly conserved phenylalanine residue (Figure 1A) (Chung et al., 2014; Leen et al., 2016). Using affinity purification on m7-GTP sepharose, we confirmed that the NV VPg protein, as produced during authentic virus replication in a NV replicon bearing cell line, interacts with the cap-binding complex eIF4F (Figure 1B). Components of the eIF4F complex, namely the eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4A helicase and the eIF4GI scaffold protein, along with poly-A binding protein (PABP) and eIF3 subunits, were readily purified on m7-GTP sepharose, whereas GAPDH was not. In NV-replicon containing cells, mature VPg was also enriched on m7-GTP sepharose but the NS3 protein, known to have RNA binding and helicase activity (Li et al., 2018), was not. Furthermore, we demonstrated that transfection of GFP-tagged versions of either the MNV or NV VPg proteins into 293 T cells allowed for the affinity purification of eIF4F components and that mutations in the eIF4G binding domain of VPg reduced this association (Figure 1C).",

Most of the proteins identified were components of the host cell translation complex including ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors and host RNA binding proteins. These data agrees with but significantly extend our previous observations using a less sensitive multi-step affinity purification approach to characterise host factors associated with the MNV VPg protein only (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2014). In addition, we identified hnRNPA1 which we have previously shown to act in norovirus genome circularization (L\u00f3pez-Manr\u00edquez et al., 2013). YBX1, DDX3 and several other proteins that we have previously found to interact with the 5\u2019 end of the viral RNA (Vashist et al., 2012a) were also enriched on VPg (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1). To validate a select number of these interactions and to assess whether the interaction of VPg with eIF4G is required for their association with VPg, we performed western blot analysis of complexes purified from cells transfected with either the WT or eIF4G-binding mutants (Figure 1E). Except for YBX1, the association of all proteins tested were reduced by the introduction of eIF4G-binding site mutations into the MNV VPg protein. Together, these data extend our previous observations and confirm that the norovirus VPg proteins interact with a complex network of host factors, many of which have been implicated in the host cell translation initiation process.",

The insertion positions were previously identified using a transposon based mutagenesis screen as sites that tolerate insertions, without compromising virus viability (Thorne et al., 2012). Our approach was somewhat analogous to that recently published for coronaviruses (V'kovski et al., 2019) but instead used stable isotope labelling of permissive cells and the FLAG affinity purification tag rather than proximity labelling. Unlabelled or stable isotope labelled highly permissive BV2 microglial cells were infected with either wild type MNV or the equivalent virus carrying the FLAG epitope purification tag in either NS1/2 or NS4, and the viral replication complex was purified. The experiment was performed three times by swapping the labelled derivatives of arginine and lysine as described in the Materials and methods. Silver stain of the purified complexes confirmed the presence of the bait proteins, with both the uncleaved and cleaved forms of NS1/2 and NS2 being highly enriched (Figure 2B). As expected, complexes purified from NS1/2-Flag virus infected cells co-purified untagged NS4 and vice versa (Figure 2B), as we have previously shown these proteins to interact to form a complex (Thorne et al., 2012). Western blot analysis of the purified complexes confirmed that viral non-structural and structural proteins were specifically enriched in the purified complexes, including NS5 (VPg)-containing precursors (Figure 2C). We noted that anti-NS4 monoclonal antibody was unable to detect protein in the extracts prior to enrichment, which most likely reflected the limited sensitivity of the antibody. Quantitative mass spectrometry of the purified complexes allowed the identified of viral and cellular proteins enriched in the complex (Figure 2D and Supplementary file 2).",

In contrast, NS1/2 effectively pulled down mature VPg (Figure 2C and S2.2). Consistent with this, NS1/2 enriched the VPg binding partner eIF4G more than 2-fold, while pulldown of NS4 resulted in no eIF4G enrichment, likely indicating that the NS4/5 (VPg) precursor cannot effectively function in translation initiation (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). This is consistent with a previous observation that binding of C-terminal VPg fusion proteins to eIF4G is inhibited (Leen et al., 2016), but may further suggest that the function of VPg is also altered when present as an N-terminal fusion with NS4. Comparison with the proteomics data obtained using VPg as a bait protein (Figure 1) showed some degree of overlap with our replication complex proteome data (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). Consistent with our observations with the well-established VPg partner eIF4G, most host factors identified using VPg were enriched by >2 fold using only the NS1/2 tagged virus, and not the NS4-tagged virus. Ontology analysis of host factors enriched by both VPg and NS1/2 more than 2-fold reveals a cross-section of the replication complex proteome dedicated to translation, and RNA metabolism (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 3).

            "text": "A high density CRISPR library screen was undertaken to identify genes that contribute to the norovirus life cycle. The Brie library (Doench et al., 2016) was selected due to the reduced off-target effects relative to previously described CRISPR libraries used for norovirus studies (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 2016). In addition, to minimise the impact of gRNAs that may have deleterious effects on long term cell viability and to increase our ability to detect genes that may be important, but not essential, for norovirus-induced cell death, the infection was reduced to 24 hr as compared to 2\u201310 days post infection in previous studies. BV2-Cas9 expressing cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying the Brie gRNA library carrying 78,637 independent guide RNAs to 19,674 genes (Doench et al., 2016). The transduced cells were then infected with two MNV strains, CW3 and CR6, which cause acute and persistent infections in immunocompetent mice respectively (Nice et al., 2013; Thackray et al., 2007), and guide RNA abundance compared to mock infected cells at 24 hr post infection as illustrated in Figure 3A. Genes that were enriched by STARS analysis following MNV infection represent putative pro-viral factors which when disrupted, resulting in slower cell death, whereas those with a negative STARS value represent putative anti-viral factors where virus-induced cell death has occurred quicker, resulting in their underrepresentation in the final pool of cells. MNV-CR6 infection resulted in 212 genes being enriched and 42 being negatively selected (Figure 3B), whereas for MNV-CW3 279 and 18 genes were positively and negatively selected respectively (Figure 3B). In most cases, there was a clear correlation between the datasets obtained using either strain (Figure 3C). STARS analysis was used to ranks genes with positive and negative values with an FDR value less than 0.05 (Supplementary file 4). In both screens, the MNV receptor Cd300lf was the most highly positively selected gene identified, in agreement with previous reports (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 2016). The previously characterised pro-viral MNV gene VapA (McCune et al., 2017) was also identified in both screens (Supplementary file 4). The second most highly enriched gene was G3BP1, a gene also identified in one of the two previous CRISPR screens performed on norovirus infected cells (Orchard et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Comparing the CRISPR data obtained in this study using two divergent strains of MNV showed a high degree of overlap, with 89 common pro-viral hit and five common anti-viral hits (Supplementary file 4). However comparison with the previous reported CRISPR screen used to identify the MNV receptor (Orchard et al., 2016) showed only seven proviral hits for CW3 and 8 for CR6, of which only four were common for both strains across all screens (Supplementary file 4). The four genes identified were the MNV receptor CD300lf, the stress granule component G3BP1, the histone methytransferase Kmt2d and Smarce1, which encodes an actin dependent regulator of chromatin. The discrepancy between the screens performed here and those in previous studies likely reflects the experimental conditions under which the screens were undertaken that is 24 hr of infection vs 2\u20133 days in the previous screens. The previous screen was performed under much more stringent conditions that were unlikely to identify proteins that play a role in the norovirus life cycle but are not essential. Pathway over-representation analysis (Liao et al., 2019) of the genes pro-viral genes identified in the CRISPR screens performed in this study highlighted mRNA processing, RNA splicing and methylation as the three most highly represented gene ontology (GO) terms (Supplementary file 4). The gene encoding PTBP1, polypyrimidine tract binding protein, was one of the genes identified in these enriched GO terms. PTBP1 is a protein we have previously shown to bind to a 3\u2019 pyrimidine-rich stretch in the MNV genome which is important for viral pathogenesis (Bailey et al., 2010). The interaction of PTBP1 with the viral 3\u2019 end also facilitates the recruitment of PTBP1 to the viral replication complex where it contributes to an as yet undefined aspect of the norovirus life cycle (Vashist et al., 2012b).",

A clear defect was observed in the ability to replicate to produce infectious virus in three independently selected \u0394G3BP1 cell lines (Figure 4B). This effect was mirrored by an inability to induce cytopathic effect leading to virus-induced cell death (Figure 4C and D).

To establish the experimental system, we first confirmed that the presence of VPg on the 5\u2019 end of the Norwalk RNA was essential for the replication of the replicon RNA and for the capacity to form G418 resistant colonies. Transfection of replicon RNA, purified from replicon containing cells, into BHK cells readily resulted in the formation of antibiotic resistant cell colonies (Figure 5A). In contrast, RNA that was proteinase K treated prior to transfection was unable to produce replicon containing colonies. Transfection of replicon RNA into wild type U2OS osteosarcoma cells allowed the formation of replicon-containing colonies, although the efficiency of formation was significantly less than that seen in BHK cells (Figure 5B). CRISPR modified U2OS cells that lacked G3BP1 (Kedersha et al., 2016) were unable to support NV replication, as evident by the lack of antibiotic resistant colonies (Figure 5B). To further examine the role of G3BP1 in human Norwalk virus replication, WT or G3BP1 deficient U2OS cells were transfected with NV replicon VPg-linked RNA, and RNA synthesis monitored overtime following the addition of G418. While a significant increase in NV viral RNA levels was seen in WT U2OS cells, those lacking G3BP1 were completely unable to support NV RNA synthesis (Figure 5C). We further validated these observations by transfection of the NV replicon in murine BV2 microglial cells which were able to support HuNoV replication by the formation of small microcolonies of antibiotic resistant cells (Figure 5D). In the absence of G3BP1 the formation of antibiotic resistant microcolonies was completely ablated and then subsequently restored in \u0394G3BP1 cells engineered to express the wild type version of G3BP1 (Figure 5D). These data indicate that like for MNV, G3BP1 is essential for human Norwalk virus replication.",

These data confirm that the RNA binding domains of G3BP1 are essential for its function in the norovirus life cycle.",

Transfection of MNV viral VPg-linked RNA into WT cells resulted in high yields of infectious virus (Figure 7A) and viral proteins (Figure 7C). The levels of infectivity obtained following transfection of \u0394G3BP1 cell lines with MNV viral RNA was comparable to that obtained in WT cells in the presence of the nucleoside analogue 2'-C-methylcytidin (2CMC), a known inhibitor of the norovirus RNA polymerase (Rocha-Pereira et al., 2012; Rocha-Pereira et al., 2013) (Figure 7A). No viral proteins were detected in either of the \u0394G3BP1 cell lines suggesting a defect at a very early stage in the viral life cycle (Figure 7C). Transfection of VPg-linked RNA into the \u0394G3BP1 cell lines reconstituted with WT G3BP1 restored the ability to produce infectious virus (Figure 7B) and the production of viral proteins (Figure 7D). A minor increase in viral infectivity was observed in the \u0394G3BP1 cell line reconstituted with the \u0394RGG construct producing viral titres that were higher than those obtained from the WT complemented line in the presence of 2CMC, suggesting low levels of viral replication (Figure 7B). However, the levels of viral proteins produced in this line was below the limit of detection by western blot (Figure 7D). These data confirm that G3BP1 is required for a post entry stage of the norovirus life cycle and that in the absence of G3BP1 no norovirus replication was observed within the sensitivity of the assay used.",

The production of viral positive sense RNA was reduced to background levels in the absence of G3BP1, comparable to levels observed when the 2CMC was present during the infection (Figure 8B). Viral negative sense RNA synthesis was also reduced to below the detection limit of the assay in \u0394G3BP1 cell lines (Figure 8C). Surprisingly, we were able to detect an ~5 fold increase in viral negative sense RNA production at 6 hr post infection of WT cells in the presence of 2CMC, which, given that 2CMC was added after the inoculation phase (Figure 8B), likely represents the first round of viral negative sense RNA synthesis, confirming the sensitivity of the assay. Addition of 2CMC during the inoculation phase reduced this background levels (data not shown).",

Complementation with WT G3BP1, but not the mutant forms lacking the RNA binding domains, also restored viral positive and negative sense RNA synthesis (Figure 8F and G). We did not detect viral positive or negative sense RNAs in the \u0394RGG complemented cell line, despite the presence of low levels of viral infectivity (Figure 7B). This discrepancy likely reflects the relative sensitivities of the assays and the nature of the strand specific qPCR assay which requires low levels of RNA input to maintain strand specificity. Together these data suggest that the function of G3BP1 is prior to, or at the level of viral negative sense RNA synthesis, with the most logical steps being either viral RNA translation or the formation of viral replication complexes.",

            "text": "We have previously shown that norovirus VPg interacts with eIF4G to recruit ribosomal subunits and direct viral translation (Chaudhry et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2014). The interaction between VPg and eIF4G occurs via a direct interaction between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and the central HEAT domain of eIF4G (Leen et al., 2016) and does not require any additional cellular cofactors, as a stable complex can be formed between VPg and the eIF4G HEAT domain at least in vitro. The interaction between the eIF4G HEAT domain and the eIF3 complex plays a central role in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation (Marcotrigiano et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2013). Our proteomics analysis also confirms that the norovirus VPg proteins form a complex that contains multiple components of the large and small ribosomal subunits (Figure 1D). It has been established previously that G3BP1 associates with 40S subunits (Kedersha et al., 2016). To assess a potential role for G3BP1 in the formation of VPg-driven translation complexes in cells, we examined the ability of GFP tagged versions of MNV VPg to pull down ribosomal proteins in the presence and absence of G3BP1. GFP-tagged WT MNV VPg was readily able to pull down eIF4G, G3BP1 and RpS6, a component of the 40S subunit (Figure 9A). However, in the absence of G3BP1, the ability to pull down RpS6 and RpS3 was lost (Figure 9A and Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we found that disruption of the VPg-eIF4G interaction by the introduction of the F123A mutation into the eIF4G binding domain, also significantly reduced the ability to pull down RpS6, RpS3, as well as RpL4, a component of the large ribosomal subunit (Figure 9B and Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1). We also observed that upon reconstitution of G3BP1 expression, the levels of RpS6, RpS3 and RpL4 associated with VPg were enhanced (Figure 9B and Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1). We note however that the levels of ribosomal proteins associated with the GFP-tagged VPg in this assay is relatively low, we think this reflect the fact that in the context of viral infection where VPg is covalently linked to viral RNA, secondary interactions between translation initiation factors and the viral RNA likely stabilise this complex. We have previously seen that the eIF4A protein binds directly to the 5\u2019 end of the sapovirus genome (Hosmillo et al., 2016). Furthermore, eIF4G is known to make secondary stabilising interactions with the template RNA that are critical for translation initiation (Yanagiya et al., 2009). Therefore we hypothesise that in the absence of covalently linked viral RNA, the association of VPg with ribosomal subunits is less robust and therefore less able to be maintained during the purification process used in the GFP-Trap approach. Therefore, to assess how the loss of G3BP1 may influence the association of VPg-linked viral RNA with ribosomal subunits in a more physiologically relevant system, we quantified the amount of viral VPg-linked RNA bound to ribosomal subunits by RNA-IP. By inclusion of the viral RNA polymerase inhibitor 2CMC we were able to assess viral RNA association with ribosomal proteins in the absence of viral RNA synthesis. We found that in the absence of G3BP1, the amount of viral RNA associated with the ribosomal subunit protein RpS3 was decreased (Figure 9C). These data suggest that that G3BP1 likely contributes in some manner to the association of VPg and viral VPg-linked RNA with ribosomal subunits.",

            "text": "To assess the impact of G3BP on the translation of viral VPg-linked RNA following viral infection, we evaluated the impact of loss of G3BP1 on the recruitment of viral RNA to polysomes under conditions where viral RNA synthesis was inhibited, namely in the presence of 2CMC. This approach enabled us to assess only the capacity of the incoming parental viral RNA to assemble into translationally active complexes, a stage often referred to as the \u2018maiden round\u2019 of RNA virus genome translation. To this aim, cells were infected with MNV in the presence of 2CMC and polysomes profiling on extracts prepared from cells at 4 and 9 hr post infection performed (Figure 10A). Quantification of the viral RNA levels in cells in the presence of 2CMC confirmed that the absence of G3BP1 has no impact on the overall levels present at the time points examined (data not shown). We noted that even in the presence of 2CMC, which inhibits viral RNA synthesis, there was a small but measurable increase in free 80S ribosomes over time in WT cells but not in cells lacking G3BP1 (Figure 10A). We have previously found that MNV infection results in translation shut off and that this effect is at least partially due to the activity of the NS6 protease (Emmott et al., 2017). The fact we observed 80S accumulation in WT cells, even in the absence of viral RNA synthesis, but not in cells lacking G3BP1, indirectly lead us to suspect that translation of viral RNA had occurred in WT cells, but was much less efficient in cells lacking G3BP1. Further analyses indicated that while most ribosome-associated norovirus RNA in WT cells was found in polysomes containing fractions, less viral RNA was found in ribosome-containing fractions (1\u201312 in Figure 10A and B) in the absence of G3BP1 and, in comparison to WT cells, very little viral RNA was found in fractions containing polysomes (Figure 10B). Extending the fractionation to include the free RNA and ribonucleoprotein complexes at the top of each gradient confirmed that in the absence of G3BP1 norovirus RNA is less efficient at assembling into polysomal fractions, suggesting a defect at the level of viral protein synthesis (Figure 10C). Together these data support the hypothesis that G3BP1 functions to promote the translation of norovirus VPg-linked RNA, by facilitating the association with ribosomal subunits and the formation of polysomes on viral RNA.",

In order to ensure comparable overall translation efficiencies between extracts, RNA generated from a cricket paralysis virus IRES (CrPV) bicistronic reporter plasmid (a kind gift from Professor Ian Brierley, University of Cambridge) was used to measure cap-dependent and cap-independent translation (Wang and Jan, 2014). The dual luciferase construct was in vitro transcribed, capped and poly(A) tailed. Renilla luciferase was produced via cap-dependent translation initiation whilst firefly luciferase was synthesised via cap-independent, CrPV IRES-dependent translation (Figure 11A). Both cap-dependent (Figure 11B) and CrPV IRES-dependent translation (Figure 11C) were comparable in extracts prepared from WT and \u0394G3BP1 cell lines (Figure 11A). To compare norovirus VPg-dependent translation efficiency between WT and \u0394G3BP1 lysates, viral VPg-linked RNA was first extracted from sucrose cushion-purified MNV virions and the presence of VPg on the viral RNA 5\u2019 end confirmed by resistance to XrnI mediated degradation in vitro (Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1 panel A). The translation profile of the purified viral RNA was further analysed by translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in comparison to in vitro transcribed viral genomic and sub-genomic RNAs (Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1 panel B). We found that norovirus VPg-dependent translation was reduced in nuclease treated extracts prepared from cells lacking G3BP (Figure 11D). Quantification of the levels of multiple viral proteins produced over multiple experiments indicated that translation in nuclease treated extracts was on average reduced by ~40\u201350% because of G3BP1 ablation (Figure 11E). A similar reduction in in vitro translation was observed across multiple time points (Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1 panel C). This 50% reduction in translation efficiency was also consistently observed in extracts that were not nuclease treated, and therefore contained physiologically relevant levels of cellular mRNAs (Figure 11F and G). These data further confirm that G3BP1 functions to enhance norovirus VPg-dependent translation initiation.",
