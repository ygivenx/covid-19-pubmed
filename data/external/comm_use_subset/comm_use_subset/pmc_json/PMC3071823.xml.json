            "text": "Since it was first recognized in 1998, Nipah virus (NiV) has caused several outbreaks in humans of encephalitic disease associated with high lethality. In the first outbreak, which was in Malaysia and Singapore, 265 humans became sick and some \u223c40% of them died. Epidemiological links pointed to human contact with sick pigs in commercial piggeries, and the outbreak was brought under control through culling of approximately \u223c1.1 million pigs [1], [2], [3], [4]. Since then, the virus has re-emerged in Bangladesh and neighboring India, starting in 2001, and between then and now, has caused several smaller but even deadlier disease outbreaks with case fatality rates ranging between 60 and 90% [5], [6], [7], [8]. Unlike the Malaysian outbreak, the route of transmission in these outbreaks was considered to be bat-to-human via food contaminated with bat saliva [9]. In some cases, nosocomial transmissibility and person-to-person spread was also noted [5], [10], [11], [12]. An additional concern is that NiV is also potentially an agent of agro-terror since the rate of transmission of this virus in the pig population is close to 100% [13]. Effective vaccine and therapies are needed to combat the threats posed by NiV.",

It has several distinctive genetic and biologic features [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] although its morphology and genome organization is similar to that of other members of the subfamily. NiV has six genes arranged in tandem, 3\u2032-N, P, M, F, G and L-5\u2032 [15], [16]. The N, P and L are required for reconstituting viral RNA polymerase activity, the matrix protein M is required for particle formation and budding, and the two surface glycoproteins G and F are required for attachment and entry into the host cell [19], [20]. EphrinB2 and B3 have been identified as the NiV entry receptors [21], [22], [23]. After fusion of the virus and the cell membrane, the viral ribonucleoprotein is released in to the cell cytoplasm. Following transcription and replication, the viral components migrate to the plasma membrane for assembly and budding of progeny particles [24], [25].",

The same approach for human use vaccines is undergoing extensive evaluation, largely for HIV and AIDS [27]. A soluble NiV G protein approach has also shown promise [28], [29]. However, subunit approaches are in general less effective than particulate immunogens, and can suffer from suboptimal presentation to the immune system [30], [31], [32]. Immunogenicity in mice to NiV glycoproteins has been reported recently using two vectored approaches for gene delivery; one using Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons [33] and the other involving inoculation of a mix of two complementing defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV\u0394G) vectors, one for expressing each of the two NiV glycoproteins [34]. The latter approach is new and seems promising but its regulatory approval as human vaccine might be problematic [34], [35].",

Plasmid-mediated expression of selected viral proteins results in the spontaneous assembly and release of VLPs. These particles make highly effective immunogens because they possess several features of the authentic virus such as their surface structure and dimensions [31], [36]. They are also safe because they do not contain any viral genetic material. VLPs, where one or more of the constituent proteins serve as immunogens (native VLPs), are particularly effective as vaccines for infectious disease. The fact that two such vaccines [Gardasil (Merck & Co) for human papillomavirus (HPV), and Sci-B-Vac (SciGen) and Bio-HepB (GlaxoSimthKline) for Hepatitis B virus (HBV)] have already been approved for human use, and many, for non-enveloped and enveloped viruses [31], [32], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42] are at various stages of development, attests to the desirability of this approach for vaccine development.",

NiV virus-like particles have also been described [48]; the results of this study showed 1) that NiV G and F proteins individually retained some budding capacity although it was far less efficient than that of the M protein and 2) NiV N, M, F and G-containing VLPs resembled the virus in some respects but differed significantly from it with respect to ratio of VLP-incorporated F protein; most of it was present in precursor F0 form. Recently, the vaccine potential of native VLPs of NDV [49] has been described: these particles, composed of HN, F, M and NP proteins, had several virus-like properties. However, since the F protein in this formulation was modified by design to ablate the cleavage site, it remained in its precursor form; consequently, the NDV VLPs were non-fusogenic, and therefore incapable of inducing syncytia formation.",

The G and F proteins were included because they mediate attachment and entry into the host cell [50], [51], [52], both are major targets of neutralizing antibodies, and both are major players in vaccine induced protection [52], [53], [54]. NiV G and F together are also the most effective as immunogens; this was elucidated in a canary pox virus vector-based experimental protective efficacy study [26]. The M protein was included in our formulation because it is required for particle formation and release [20], [25], [45]. Under optimized conditions, we were able to make substantial, quantifiable amounts of NiV VLPs composed of these three NiV proteins. This has allowed us to characterize their properties in detail to show that they possessed many virus-like/vaccine desirable properties in vitro. It has also allowed us to test for immunogenicity in vivo in Balb/c mice; note that although NiV does not cause disease in these animals, NiV proteins injected in them are known to induce robust neutralizing antibody response [29], [33], [34]. Importantly, NiV-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies are protective in the hamster model of NiV disease [55].",

This assay provides only a comparative assessment of VLP formation since it only accounts for VLPs that are able to incorporate and passage minigenomes. However, based on the assumption that the ratio of empty and minigenome-containing VLPs will be equivalent in each reaction, the method provides an indirect means to determine the optimal set of conditions for VLP production as determined by VLP-incorporated minigenome-encoded CAT enzyme activity. Briefly, the steps involved in the VLP infectivity assay were 1) transfection of NiV minigenome construct and co-transfection with full complement of the NiV protein expression plasmids, N, P, L, M, F and G, using Lipofectamine 2000. 2) following replication (48 hours post-transfection), passage of equal volume of VLP-containing transfected cell SUP on to fresh cells previously transfected with N, P and L plasmids and 3), determination of CAT activity in the VLP infected cells 48 hours later. Replication of the VLP-incorporated incoming mingenomes based on reporter gene activity indicates the level of particle formation and release, VLP infectivity, and successful minigenome packaging.",

Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids as shown in Figure 1. For titrating NiV G, F and M plasmids, increasing concentrations of either G, or F or M expression plasmids were, in turn, co-transfected with fixed concentrations of the other two plasmids. The minigenome and N, P and L plasmids were transfected using a predetermined ratio [57]. The VLP-containing cell SUP was harvested 48 hours post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation, and equal volume from each was passaged onto fresh cell monolayers (VLP-infected cells) previously transfected with the core proteins required to support the incoming packaged minigenomes. The VLP infected cells were harvested 48 hours later and tested for optimal particle production based on incoming minigenome-encoded CAT activity. This time point was chosen because maximal VLP formation was also found to be time dependent and optimal at 48 hours post-passage (data not shown). The reproducibility of the results was verified in an independent repeat experiment. Results presented in Figure 1 show that within the given range, and based on the levels of minigenome-encoded CAT activity, varying the concentrations of G, F and M plasmids had a bearing on VLP formation. CAT activity in the VLP infected cells appeared optimal in the boxed lanes 7 and 8 but further analysis to ensure reporter activity in the linear range (data not shown) indicated that the largest amount of minigenome-containing NiV VLPs were produced when the cells were transfected with the NiV M, F and G plasmid ratios of 3\u22361\u22361 as in lane 7.

The VLP pellet was resuspended in TN buffer and viewed by EM after negative staining. The result presented in Figure 2A shows a VLP-containing band in the sucrose gradient. Viewing of the negatively stained purified particles by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 2B) showed numerous virus-like particles. The size variation of these VLPs was consistent with the parental virus: NiV is a pleomorphic virus ranging in size from 40\u20131900 nm [63], [64]; the sizes of the VLPs ranged from \u223c40\u2013500 nm. The particles also resembled authentic NiV morphologically, and this is seen more clearly in the magnified images presented in Figure 2C; here, the fringe of the glycoproteins is clearly visible on the VLP surface.

The right hand panel in the Figure 3 shows VLP-incorporated proteins in two different preparations of NiV VLPs. The protein bands are consistent in size to NiV proteins G, F0, F1 and M proteins [17], [48]. The relative amounts of the VLP-incorporated G and M proteins appeared to be similar to that reported in NiV virions also [17]. This was in spite of the fact that the viral proteins in that study were revealed using rabbit sera raised against bacterially expressed Hendra virus proteins. However, the ratio of the VLP-incorporated F1 to F0 was different from that in the virions. This difference is more likely to be a reflection of timing and protein turnover rather than the reagents used to reveal them since in a previous study, pulse chase experiments have shown that similarly to the VLP-incorporated F1 to F0, intracellular cleavage of the precursor NiV fusion protein by cathepsin L results in near equal mix of mature fusogenic, and the precursor forms [65]. Absence of the NiV-specific bands in two different 293T cell lysate preparations processed similarly (and shown in the left hand panel in Figure 3) confirms specificity of the VLP-incorporated proteins.",

Briefly, the VLPs were pre-incubated with NiV-specific antibody, Junin virus (JV)-specific antibody, and with OPTI-MEM I (Invitrogen Inc) medium only for one hour at 37\u00b0C before inoculating onto near confluent 293 cell monolayers grown overnight in 60 mm dishes.

The monolayers were then viewed for the formation of syncytia after staining with crystal violet. The results in Figure 4 show that 293 cells exposed to NiV VLPs induced syncytium formation and that this process was neutralized by NIV-specific antibodies; prior incubation with the unrelated JV antibodies failed to block this process.",

These genes represent key sensors of non-self that signal, and ultimately shape the nature of innate immune response that modulates the type and duration of adaptive immune responses [66], [67]. The differential expression of genes in VLP-exposed 293 cells relative to the \u201cmock\u201d infected 293 cells was measured by real-time PCR. Same concentration of total cell RNA from the VLP-stimulated and the \u201cmock\u201d stimulated control cells were used for first strand synthesis and Sybr green PCR amplification of the relevant genes as described under Methods. The integrity of RNA in each sample was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure 6A). Data representing the differential transcription profile of VLP exposed vs. \u201cmock\u201d stimulated cells is shown as a heat map (Figure 6B). A 4-fold cutoff threshold was used to determine modulation in gene expression. We noted significant VLP-stimulated up-regulation (89 fold and 7 fold) in the expression of NFKB2 and TBK1 genes respectively. Close to four fold (3.9 fold) up-regulation was noted also in IL-8 and MAPK8 genes. NFKB2 and IL-8 are target genes in the downstream NFKB pathway, and TBK1 which are in the IRF and JNK/p38 pathways respectively.",

The two vaccination strategies that have already been explored are the canary pox-based vector approach [26] and soluble subunit approach [28], [29]. NiV vaccine by the former method is undergoing development as a veterinary vaccine [26]. The same approach is being evaluated for human use vaccines, mainly for the prevention of HIV and AIDS [27]. The subunit approach has limitations as already mentioned above [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. One particular challenge revealed by studies that tested a soluble NiV G protein-based subunit vaccine formulated with adjuvant is the potential difficulty of eradicating infection in the central nervous system. In that study [28], live virus was present in the brain of one cat, and viral RNA was present throughout the 21 day post-challenge period in the brains of the remaining challenged animals. A recently reported vaccination strategy [34] requires simultaneous inoculation of two VSV\u0394G vectors, one expressing NiV G, and the other expressing NiV F proteins. It was of interest to note that supernatants of cells co-infected with these two defective viruses were infectious and could be passaged indefinitely in the absence of VSV G trans-complementation. This vaccination approach seems promising since self-propagated stock of these two viruses induced robust neutralizing antibody response in mice. However, potential pathogenicity of VSV-based vaccine vectors remains a concern [34], [35]. The potential of a recombination event resulting in a single VSV vector virus expressing both these NiV proteins is unlikely, but it may still be problematic for a human use vaccine.",

VLPs are particularly effective in producing a protective antibody response because of their virus-like size range, their particulate nature, and their virus-like dense, repetitive and ordered surface structure [31], [36]. The spacing of the antigenic epitopes on the VLP is also optimal for B cell activation [31]: EM analysis showed that our particles resembled the real virus in terms of size and surface structure [63], [64]. The image in Figure 2D is the first elucidation of VLP structure of any paramyxovirus imaged by CryoEM, and it provides a careful assessment of their morphology; it alludes to a surface similar to that revealed for measles virus by the same imaging technique (Dr. Elizabeth Wright, Emory University). The proteins on the VLP surface are clearly visible here; the average distance between the spikes was 9.13 nm and standard deviation was 1.72 nm. This is of interest given that epitopes spaced between 5 and 10 nm are known to be sufficient to drive optimal B cell activation [36].",

However, in that study, most of the particle-incorporated NiV F protein was predominantly in the uncleaved precursor form. This finding is clearly distinct from ours since our VLPs contained substantial amounts of cleaved F protein, and this may have been related to ratios of the interacting proteins expressed in 293T transfected cells. In a recent study of NDV VLPs [49], the particle-incorporated proteins were reported to have virus-like protein ratios, but the F protein remained in its precursor form because the cleavage site required to produce the fusion competent form was mutated by design. What effect a VLP-incorporated non-fusogenic F protein may have, relative to the fusogenic form, on the level and quality of VLP-induced immune response is not clear at present since difference in immunogenicity between fusion-competent and fusion-defective VLPs has not been experimentally evaluated so far. However, a recent report suggests that viral fusogenic membrane glycoproteins may enhance vaccine potency [68].",

We could deduce the presence of biologically active G and F proteins on the VLP surface by the fact that they were able to induce the formation of syncytia in 293 cells (Figure 4); this is a process that requires the interaction of both the surface glycoproteins, the attachment protein G, and the fusion competent F protein, when they come in contact with the cognate receptor-bearing cells. Formation of syncytia or multinucleated cells in replication competent enveloped viruses, especially paramyxoviruses, is induced by a process that is described as \u201cfusion from within\u201d, and it can be blocked or neutralized by prior treatment of the virus with specific antisera. In contrast, \u201cfusion from without\u201d is induced by non-replicating viruses at high multiplicities of infection, and it too can be blocked by pretreatment with virus-specific antibodies ([69], and references therein; [70]). Our non-replicating particles likewise induced syncytia formation in 293 cells that could be neutralized with NiV-specific antibodies (Figure 4). To our knowledge, this is the first study describing fusion from without induced by VLPs of any paramyxovirus, or any other enveloped viruses, although it has been described for the VLPs of the non-enveloped rotavirus [71]. The mechanism(s) of fusion from without is not clear but two models have been proposed [72], [73]; one proposes that particles connecting adjacent cells effectively promote fusion between them, and the other is that when particles decorated with the surface glycoproteins fuse with the target cell membrane, the glycoprotein complexes diffuse freely in the lipid bilayer, and mimic fusion from within. The type of VLP-induced syncytia formation and eventual cell death is also not known. We are in the process of investigating it.",

Our VLPs were highly effective immunogens, and all, especially in the three higher treatment groups produced high levels of response by day 35 (Figures 5A). Importantly, NiV VLPs were able to induce neutralizing antibodies. This response was clearly dose-dependent (Figure 5B). All ten mice receiving a primary inoculation of 7 or 14 \u00b5g VLPs (subgroup C and D) were able to produce such response; but even of those animals that received a first dose of only 3.5 or 1.75 ug/mouse (treatment group B and A respectively), 3 of 5 and 1 of 5 produced neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization antibody response was first seen on day 28, and increasing titers were seen in some animals within a week of it; we believe that this response, induced by our non-replicating and potentially safe particles, formulated without adjuvant, compares favorably with the levels of such response induced at an equivalent time point by some replication competent pseudotype viruses [34].",

The mechanism by which NiV VLPs are recognized by host cells and trigger the induction of innate immune response, and how this translates into effective adaptive immunity is not known. Here we have taken the first step (Figure 6) towards understanding this process. With the experimental conditions as described, we observed VLP-induced activation of some of the genes that are known to be involved in the induction of an effective innate immune response [75]. Results presented in the heat map in Figure 6 show that relative to the \u201cmock\u201d treated cells, NFKB2 gene (in the NFKB pathway) was up-regulated 89 fold as a result of VLP exposure, and TBK1 (in the IRF pathway) was 7 fold higher. In the light of these findings, we are testing PCR array expression profiles of the same set of 84 genes in 293 and other cells at earlier and later time points to identify their upstream effectors, and NiV VLP-responsive signaling networks. In this respect, the murine system, with the many available immunological reagents and knockout strains may provide the best system to identify these host sensors. Currently there is minimal information on live NiV infection-responsive cell-signaling changes [76] and there is none on array-based transcriptional alterations for comparative analysis. Likewise, it has not been possible to compare the NiV VLP-induced transcription modulation with those induced by other paramyxovirus VLPs since to our knowledge, such studies have not been undertaken so far. Lastly, a growing number of reports point to viral surface glycolproteins as relevant in host cell signaling and triggering of innate immune response. We believe that particles like NiV VLPs, with many virus-like properties (including their surface glycoproteins organized to resemble the parental virus, Figure 2D) would induce an effective innate immune response for the promotion of the desired adaptive immunity [67], [76].",

They were co-transfected with the previously optimized minigenome and N, P and L constructs [16], [57]. Forty eight hours post transfection, the cell SUPs were clarified by centrifugation, and same volume of SUP from each sample was used to infect new cell monolayers (VLP infected) which were transfected 24 hours previously with the core plasmids N, P and L to support replication of the VLP-incorporated minigenome RNA; the VLP-infected cells were harvested 48 hours later for reporter gene analysis. Panel A shows the plasmids transfected in each reaction. Panel B: shows minigenome-encoded CAT activity in VLP infected cell monolayers. Lane 1 is a negative control. Absence of CAT activity in duplicate lanes 2 and 3 indicates that VLP formation, and consequently VLP-incorporated minigenome transfer and expression, does not occur in the absence of M, F and G proteins. The results in lanes 4 through 15 shows that CAT levels varied in VLP infected samples depending on the concentration of M, F and G constructs used at transfection. Thus, the amount of M, F and G plasmids used at transfection had a bearing on the level of particle formation, and the consequent CAT reporter gene transfer and expression. CAT activity in the VLP infected reactions appeared optimal in the boxed lanes 7 and 8. Further analysis of CAT levels in the linear range (data not shown) demonstrated that optimal VLP formation was achieved with the ratios of M, F and G expression plasmids of 3\u22361\u22361 (lane 7).",
