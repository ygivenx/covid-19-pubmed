Therefore, continuously replicating viral infections represent scenarios of an ineffective immune response or immune tolerance. Mechanistic studies of persistently replicating viral infections including lymphocytic choriomenengitis virus (LCMV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) mouse models have provided numerous insights into immune mechanisms of viral persistence [1\u20134]. In general, study of these and other models have focused on adaptive immune tolerance or the loss of adaptive immune function in determining viral persistence [5\u20138]. Thus, a paradigm has emerged that viral persistence is linked to defective or tolerant adaptive immune responses [3].",

Human NoV and the closely related murine NoV (MNoV) also establish persistent asymptomatic infection, which may contribute to spread and population-level persistence in between outbreaks [9\u201312]. Study of MNoV strains that differ in persistence has begun to identify viral and host correlates of persistent infection. MNoV strain CW3 is cleared whereas strain CR6 persists in wild type mice [10,13]. We recently discovered that persistent intestinal CR6 infection is cleared by IFN-\u03bb-stimulated innate responses with no requirement for an adaptive immune response [14,15]. IFN-\u03bb is closely related to type I IFN, but with more specialized roles at epithelial surfaces [16]. This finding suggests that the adaptive immune response is not always necessary for control of persistent infection and that IFN responses play a role in MNoV persistence.",

CW3 spreads systemically and is controlled early by the type I IFN response [13,17]. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to identify the role of type I IFN in control of systemic CW3 persistence. We found that type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) expression on dendritic cells (DCs) was necessary for CW3 clearance. The adaptive immune response generated in mice with IFNAR deficient DCs was of increased magnitude, commensurate with the increased early viral replication, and the functional capacity of adaptive immune cells was maintained during persistent infection. Therefore, CW3 persistence in this model represents an example of viral persistence due to innate rather than adaptive immune deficiency.",

We also examined mice lacking signal transducers for toll like receptor (TLR) signaling Myd88 or Trif (Myd88\n-/- or Ticam1\n-/-). None of these individual signaling molecules was critical for CW3 clearance (Fig 1A). However, mice lacking the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 (Irf3x7\n-/-), which are utilized for interferon gene transcription by both cytosolic sensing and TLR pathways, failed to clear CW3 (Fig 1A).

However, unlike Ifnar1\n-/- mice, these lineage-specific Ifnar1 deficient mice survive CW3 infection. To assess viral clearance in these mice, we sacrificed mice 21 days after inoculation and measured viral genomes in the MLN. Persistent CW3 was detected in mice with either LysM-specific or CD11c-specific Ifnar1 deficiency (Fig 1B). In contrast, cre-negative littermate control mice or mice lacking IFNAR on Villin-expressing intestinal epithelial cells (Ifnar1\nflox/flox x Villin-cre) were able to clear CW3 infection (Fig 1B). Together, these data indicate that reduced induction of IFN or failure of myeloid cell subsets to respond to type I IFN results in CW3 persistence.",

Therefore, we assessed the tropism of CW3 over time in mice with CD11c-specific deletion of Ifnar1 (subsequently referred to as CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/-). Viral genome copies were dramatically increased in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice four days after inoculation in systemic and intestinal tissues as well as in the stool (Fig 2A). The greatest differences in genome copy number on day four were in the spleen (15,000-fold), liver (4,000-fold) and MLN (2,000-fold). CW3 was cleared from all tissues in control mice by 14 days after inoculation. The high titers of CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice were partly controlled between day 4 and day 14, with reductions in viral genomes between 8\u2013400 fold (Fig 2A). However, persistence of viral genomes was observed in the spleen, liver and MLN of CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice for at least 35 days (Fig 2A). CW3 was only sporadically detected in the ileum and colon of CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice after day 21 and was undetectable in the stool of CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice after day 14 (Fig 2A). Thus, CW3 persistence in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- was primarily localized to systemic rather than intestinal tissues. Similarly, CW3 persisted in the spleen and MLN but not in the colon of Irf3x7\n-/- mice (Fig 2B). These data are consistent with a primary role of the type I IFN response in DCs broadly limiting early viral replication and preventing viral persistence in systemic tissues.",

The cell-intrinsic antiviral mediators Ifit1 and Isg15 were present in significantly greater quantities in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice (Fig 3). Additionally, transcripts for the T cell chemokine CXCL9 were increased and transcripts for the macrophage chemokine CCL5 were unchanged in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice (Fig 3).

We further assessed NK cell numbers and expression of the surface markers KLRG1, CD62L, and Ly6C to determine if NK cell recruitment or differentiation was altered by the reduced IFNAR1 expression. NK cell numbers were unchanged (S1A Fig); NK cell expression of KLRG1 and Ly6C was not changed and expression of CD62L was modestly increased in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice (S1B Fig).

Titers of serum antibodies to both viral particles and the viral protein NS1 were significantly higher (3- and 70-fold respectively) in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice compared to littermate controls (Fig 5A). To determine if the increased antibody titers resulted in enhanced neutralization of viral particles, we performed a serum neutralization assay. Serum from CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice was more effective at neutralization of PFUs than serum from littermate controls at the 10\u22122 dilution (Fig 5B). Together, these data demonstrate that there is increased seroconversion and virus neutralization in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice.

Therefore, we stained T cells for expression of IFNAR1 to determine if it was altered in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice. T cells from CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice had 25% less IFNAR1 in uninfected mice and 50% less IFNAR1 expression 8 days post-inoculation with CW3 (Fig 6A). Thus, expression of IFNAR1 is modestly reduced on T cells in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice and may impact their activation in response to virally-induced IFN. Prior work identified the immunodominant CD8 T cell epitope for CW3 [21], which we used to assess the cellular immune response in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice. At the peak of T cell expansion eight days after inoculation, we observed an increased proportion of CW3-specific CD8 T cells in spleens (1.4-fold), MLNs (3-fold), and Peyer\u2019s patches (2-fold) of CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice compared to cre-negative littermate controls (Fig 6B). Likewise, a greater proportion of CD8 T cells in spleens of CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice responded by expressing IFN\u03b3 (1.7-fold), TNF\u03b1 (1.3-fold), or the degranulation marker CD107a (1.3-fold) following peptide restimulation ex vivo (Fig 6C). Among cells that responded to peptide restimulation in vitro, there was no significant difference in number of simultaneous functions (IFN\u03b3 production, TNF\u03b1 production, or degranulation) per cell (Fig 6E). To determine if there were increased T cell cytokine responses in vivo we quantified transcripts for IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and Granzyme B from spleens of mice 8 days after inoculation with CW3. There were increased transcripts for IFN\u03b3 and Granzyme B, while TNF\u03b1 transcripts were unchanged (Fig 6D). Together, these data indicate that, although there is a decrease in T cell IFNAR1 expression, persistence of CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar\n-/- mice is not correlated with a defect in CD8 T cell expansion or functionality. In fact, there was an increased expansion of equally functional CD8 T cells in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice.",

Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of simultaneous functions per cell following peptide restimulation (Fig 7D). We also analyzed cell surface expression of the following proteins: 1. PD-1, which is upregulated transiently after activation and sustained on exhausted T cells; 2. Ly6C, which is upregulated and sustained after activation but downregulated on exhausted T cells; 3.

Although DCs are activated (Fig 4) and a CD8 T cell response is initiated (Fig 6), we considered the possibility that virally-infected Ifnar1-deficient DCs were unable to present viral antigens to activated T cells. To test this possibility, we utilized a CW3 strain that was engineered to express the peptide SIINFEKL from chicken ovalbumin (CW3-SIINFEKL) and an antibody that recognizes SIINFEKL in the groove of the class I MHC molecule H2-Kb. DCs, Macrophages, and B cells can be infected by CW3 [19,23] whereas T cells have not been shown to support CW3 infection. Staining of CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- splenocytes three days after inoculation showed a modest increase in staining intensity for SIINFEKL-Kb on B cells, macrophages, and DCs but not T cells following inoculation with CW3-SIINFEKL compared to the corresponding cells from mice inoculated with CW3 (Fig 8A). Therefore, the absence of Ifnar1 does not prevent display of antigen on cells susceptible to viral infection. However, it remained possible that CW3 developed mutations to evade recognition by CD8 T cells. To determine if mutation of the CD8 T cell epitope occurred during persistent CW3 infection, sequencing of virus from the spleen was performed 21 days after inoculation. Examination of the sequence of persistent CW3 revealed no deviation in the CD8 T cell epitope sequence from the virus in the inoculum (Fig 8B). Therefore, the CD8 T cell response fails to clear CW3 despite persistence of the un-mutated epitope sequence.",

To test the function of the adaptive immune system in a setting where all virally infected cells are Ifnar1-sufficient, we utilized a previously published Rag1\n-/- splenocyte transfer in which CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells contribute to clearance of viral infection [24]. CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- or littermate control mice were infected with CW3; 21 days later, splenocytes were isolated and transferred into persistently infected Rag1\n-/- mice. Six days after splenocyte transfer, genomes were detected by qPCR in spleens and ileums from Rag1\n-/- and viral titers were determined mice by plaque assay. Splenocytes from either CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- or littermate control donors were similarly able to clear PFUs from the spleen and ileum (Fig 6A). Likewise, splenocytes from either donor were similarly able to reduce viral genomes in spleen (10-fold) and ileum (10-fold) (Fig 6B). These data demonstrate that the adaptive immune response in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice, including both CD4 and CD8 T cells, is functional in an Ifnar1-sufficient environment in vivo and suggest that increased viral replication in Ifnar1-deficient cells is sufficient for establishing persistent viral replication despite a functional adaptive immune response.",

Prior studies utilizing the LCMV model causally link diminished CD8 T cell functionality to viral persistence [6] and other studies have demonstrate a role for type I IFN in regulating this process [25\u201329]. Furthermore, antigen abundance has been positively correlated with the degree of CD8 T cell dysfunction [5,30]. The MNoV persistence demonstrated herein contrasts with this paradigm as it was not associated with failure to generate an adaptive immune response or loss of adaptive immune function. In fact, there is an enhanced adaptive immune response commensurate with increased viral replication, and this enhanced adaptive immune response is sustained during persistent infection. These data demonstrate that an innate immune defect in type I IFN can result in viral persistence without attendant effects on the adaptive arm of the immune system. These results provide a different view of viral persistence than prior work in the LCMV model. However, it is important to note that antigen abundance may be lower in the MNoV model relative to the LCMV model. Additionally, the importance of type I IFN in protecting against lethal infection differs between CW3 and LCMV [17,25], providing a potential basis for differing roles of type I IFN in these two models.",

Unlike the LCMV model, persistent infection of CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice is not correlated with loss of CD8 T cell numbers or function. Instead, increased viral titers are balanced by a commensurate increase in CD8 T cell expansion and antibody production: wild type mice have intact innate control and a relatively lower level of CD8 T cell expansion and antibody production; Ifnar1\n-/- mice represent an unbalanced scenario with uncontrolled early viral replication resulting in death prior to development of an adaptive response; CD11c-Ifnar1\n-/- mice represent a \u2018sweet spot\u2019 where increased viral growth is controlled but not cleared by an enhanced adaptive immune response resulting a persistent balance between viral replication and clearance (Fig 10).

Likewise, these data imply that some persistent infections could be treated by modulating innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, rather than targeting adaptive immune responses. Indeed, both of these principles are manifest in persistent HCV infection in humans. The HCV NS3/4A protease inhibits the induction of IFN by cleaving MAVS [33]. Prior to the recent development of small molecule inhibitors of HCV replication, the most effective therapy for persistent HCV infection included IFN treatment. So, successful treatment for HCV serves to circumvent the viral inhibition of IFN induction. Thus, HCV may be an example of a medically relevant persistent viral infection that persists due, in part, to loss of innate immune function. Persistence of other continuously replicating RNA viruses, such as chikungunya, measles, polyomavirus, may be similarly due to ineffective innate responses.",
