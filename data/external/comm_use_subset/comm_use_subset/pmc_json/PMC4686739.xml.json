Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive, or relapsing and remitting demyelinating disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS) specifically. In addition to demyelination, there is partial loss of oligodendroglial cells and axonal degeneration predominately within white matter, although some demyelination in MS also involves gray matter (Sharma et al., 2001; Bo et al., 2003; Vercellino et al., 2005; Lassmann et al., 2007; Rudick and Trapp, 2009). The mechanism of demyelination in MS is unknown, but may involve a T cell response triggered by virus infection (Allen and Brankin, 1993; Hern\u00e1n et al., 2001; Hemmer et al., 2002). Despite numerous attempts to identify an etiologic agent, a specific virus has not been recognized. Various animal models have been developed to study MS, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Kornek et al., 2000) as well as viral-induced CNS demyelinating disease models. One particularly useful mouse model utilizes MHV-induced demyelination that mimics the pathology of MS (Das Sarma, 2010).",

Both strains are capable of causing hepatitis, encephalitis, and meningitis, however, the two strains differ in their ability to induce subsequent demyelination and axonal loss (Das Sarma et al., 2009). Seven days post-infection, RSA59 produces demyelination that is best observed in the spinal cord. In contrast, RSMHV2 does not produce demyelination and only rarely demonstrates axonopathic changes in spinal cord white matter (Das Sarma et al., 2009). The inability of RSMHV2 to induce demyelination is due in part to a lack of transport of viral antigen (and the subsequent inflammatory reaction) to the white matter. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate deficits in the ability of RSMHV2 to spread between neurons when compared to inter-neuronal spread by RSA59 (Das Sarma et al., 2009). RSA59-induced demyelination occurs in the setting of both axonal degeneration as well as macrophage mediated myelin stripping along intact axons (Das Sarma et al., 2009). While spike glycoprotein mediates spread of viral antigen to white matter through axonal transport, specific mechanisms leading to subsequent demyelination are not known. Viral antigen in white matter axons may be sufficient to trigger an inflammatory response that damages myelin. Alternatively, viral antigen may need to spread directly into oligodendrocytes, or indirectly to oligodendrocytes via astrocytes, using the spike protein.",

            "text": "Previously, another demyelinating strain, MHV-JHM, has been shown to produce a rapidly fatal encephalomyelitis, although some temperature sensitive mutants can produce non-fatal demyelination due to selective destruction of oligodendrocytes (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982). RSA59 or its parental demyelinating strain MHV-A59 can infect oligodendrocytes in vitro, isolated from either rat or mouse, or in oligodendrocyte cell lines (Liu et al., 2006, 2011; Li et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the inability of the RSMHV2 strain to induce demyelination has not been resolved and may be due to an inability to selectively destroy/impair oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord white matter. Alternatively, the failure of RSMHV2 to effect demyelination may be related to impaired axonal transport as has already been observed (Das Sarma et al., 2009). In the current study, viral tropism of RSA59 and RSMHV2 in spinal cord oligodendrocytes, myelin, neurons, and astrocytes is compared in order to further clarify the mechanism(s) of viral-mediated demyelination.",

Mock-infected controls were injected similarly with an uninfected L2 cell lysate at a similar dilution. Mice were monitored daily for potential signs of disease including weight loss, waddling gait, partial limp, or lack of appetite. As with our prior studies, all mice developed minimal or no signs of disease, and mice were therefore sacrificed at time points based on the known disease course from prior histologic studies (Das Sarma et al., 2002, 2008). At the time of sacrifice, mice were anesthesized with ketamine/xylazine, then perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by cold PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and finally with 10 ml of PBS containing 10% sucrose. Spinal cord and brain tissues were removed and placed at 4\u00b0C for 4 h in 10% sucrose, followed by 30% sucrose overnight. Tissues were embedded in OCT medium (Tissue Tek, Hatfield, PA), sectioned sagitally with a microtome to 6 \u03bcm thickness, and mounted on glass slides.",

OPCs mainly grow on top of the astrocyte layer and are less adherent than astrocytes. Dislodged oligodendrocytes were plated onto Poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips and maintained in serum free growth medium until the culture reached 80% confluence. Adherent cells were trypsinized and plated onto glass coverslips for cellular characterization.",

Four-week-old, MHV-free, C57BL/6 (B6) mice (Jackson Laboratory) were inoculated intracranially with either RSA59 or RSMHV2. MHV replication reaches its peak at day 5, and inflammation reaches its peak at day 7 post-infection. At day 5 post-infection, viral antigen from the RSA59 strain is localized to the spinal cord gray matter with subsequent spread to the adjacent white matter. At day 7 following RSA59 infection, viral antigen is mainly localized to the white matter (Das Sarma et al., 2008). In contrast, while at day 5 post-infection, the RSMHV2 strain viral antigen is transported to the spinal cord from the brain, viral replication and spread is primarily confined within the gray matter even at day 7 post-infection with infrequent spread to the white matter. Based upon the viral antigen dissemination kinetics, imaging was performed on spinal cord cryosections from day 6 post-infection when viral spread is maximal while cellular damage is limited. Since the viral strains used express EGFP, virus-infected cells were viewed directly by fluorescence microscopy. Identification of oligodendrocytes was performed using anti-sera to Olig2 (transcription factor for oligodendrocytes), usually present in oligodendrocyte nuclei. Detection was performed utilizing a red fluorescent Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody.",

Therefore, the RSA59, but not the RSMHV2 strain is capable of intra-axonal transport with spread to the myelin sheath.",

As can be seen in Figure 7, viral antigen (EGFP) colocalizes with neurons and their axonal microtubules in the spinal cord white matter. Merged Tau immunofluorescence images with EGFP demonstrates colocalization in the white matter and the region of the gray-white matter junction (Figure 7C), demonstrating that viral antigen is present in the axons of infected neurons. Similarly, MAP2(2a + 2b) immunofluorescence, a marker of the somatodendritic compartments of neurons, colocalizes with EGFP (Figures 7F,I). Note that MAP2 is also expressed in some axons and EGFP positive axons crossing through the gray matter from the posterior columns demonstrate doubly labeled axons (Figure 7F). Neurofilament antibody labeled the neuronal cell bodies and axons in the spinal cord (Figure 7K). In the white matter of the spinal cord, there are several examples of Neurofilament immunofluorescence colocalizing with EGFP (Figure 7L). Anti-Synaptophysin antibody marks presynaptic vesicles.

Following viral infection, axonal damage can occur concurrently with and independently of demyelination and direct viral-mediated axonal damage can occur as a primary pathology, separate from demyelination. Despite the fact that both strains can infect neurons, there is impaired inter-neuronal spread of the RSMHV2 strain in vivo and in vitro as well as a lack of translocation from gray matter to white matter (Das Sarma et al., 2009) in the spinal cord. Strain specific viral dissemination and selective replication in CNS cells are also critical for MHV induced neuropathology. Our studies demonstrated that different doses of the viral strains (RSA59, 20,000 PFU vs. RSMHV2, 100 PFU) do not affect astrocyte infection within the brain (Das Sarma et al., 2008). The two very distinct and different doses of viruses used are based on 50% of the LD50, where previously it has been demonstrated that both strains replicate at a similar rate in the brain and spinal cord and viral titers at day 5 and day 7 post-infection are almost the same (Das Sarma et al., 2000, 2009). Moreover, even at 100 PFUs inoculation, RSA59 can cause demyelination although the number and size of demyelinating plaques formed was less compared to an inoculum of 20,000 PFUs (Das Sarma et al., 2000).",

Furthermore, there were no examples of Olig2 nuclear/EGFP cytoplasmic fluorescence of cells as was observed in the RSA59 infected mice. In vitro, oligodendrocyte precursors were infected by both strains whereas differentiated oligodendrocytes were only infected by the DM strain, suggesting that one needs to infect the mature oligodendrocytes, cells capable of producing myelin, in order to cause demyelination. Infection of OPCs might, however, prevent remyelination following demyelination as the OPCs are likely to be the cell type of choice for remyelination. Moreover, RSA59 strain not only infected oligodendrocytes, but also caused formation of syncytia. In contrast, RSMHV2 infected oligodendrocytes were unable to form syncytia.

Immunofluorescence and colocalization studies with neuronal cytoskeleton specific markers also demonstrate that RSA59 strain colocalizes with axonal microtubules, dendritic microtubules and neurofilament protein as well as presynaptic vesicles (synaptophysin). The latter result provides evidence for a mechanism by which RSA59 can spread transynaptically to the spinal cord white matter and gain access to oligodendrocytes and the myelin sheath. In a recent study, we also demonstrated that RSA59 can directly infect and activate microglia in the spinal cord white matter (Chatterjee et al., 2013).",

This differential viral tropism between the brain and spinal cord is likely due to the route by which virus gains access to the white matter. Mice are infected by transcranial inoculation, a traumatic disruption of the gray-white matter interface that permits viral particles direct access to myelin. From the myelin sheath, viral particles could then spread proximally to the oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. In contrast, viral involvement of the spinal cord occurs non-traumatically. A major mechanism of viral spread to spinal cord white matter is through spike-mediated axonal transport (Das Sarma et al., 2009), which may partly explain the inability of RSMHV2 viral antigen to enter oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord. Our results demonstrate that even though RSMHV2 virus reaches spinal cord gray matter neurons and replicates (Das Sarma et al., 2008), it does not spread to oligodendrocytes or myelin. Thus, spike glycoprotein must also play a significant role in facilitating direct spread of virus from neurons to oligodendrocytes.",

            "text": "The overall pattern of co-localization of viral antigen in specific CNS cell types provides a logical mechanism for MHV infection of the spinal cord. Brain neurons can be infected with both RSA59 and RSMHV2 following intracranial inoculation. Virions are likely unrestricted within neuronal cytoplasm and therefore able to diffuse or be actively transported through the axoplasm into spinal cord gray matter. From the axoplasm, only the RSA59 virus is then capable of spreading to spinal cord neurons and being transported anterogradely to the white matter, or of crossing into the myelin sheath and from there, into the oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. The lack of co-localization with GFAP with either strain indicates that the spread of MHV infection in the spinal cord does not involve an indirect route to oligodendrocytes through astrocytes. The lack of viral infection in spinal cord astrocytes is unexpected since our previous work (Das Sarma et al., 2008) clearly showed that both RSA59 and RSMHV2 could infect brain astrocytes in vivo. As described above, there was a similar discrepancy in the colocalization of EGFP in brain vs. spinal cord oligodendrocytes due to the different routes of infection (unpublished data). Traumatic transcranial inoculation likely provides viral access to astrocytes due to disruption of the pia and blood/brain barrier whereas no such disruption occurs in the spinal cord. Our results are similar to those seen with other viral strains; direct viral induced oligodendroglial dystrophy is a common etiology of JC virus induced demyelination (Weiner et al., 1972; Major et al., 1992).",

Seven day old mock infected mixed glial cells or cultures enriched for oligodendrocyte precursors or OPCs were double immunostained with anti A2B5 antibody, a marker for oligodendrocyte precursors (red) and anti GFAP, a Type-II astrocytic marker (green); nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Mixed glial culture (A) demonstrates labeling for both cell markers; cultures enriched for oligodendrocyte precursors or OPCs stain positive for TYPE-II astrocytes (B) or OPCs (C), respectively. Three sets of mixed glial cultures enriched for OPCs were infected with RSA59 (D\u2013F) or RSMHV2 (G\u2013I) at a MOI of 1. Virus-infected cells were identified by EGFP (green). EGFP expression in A2B5 positive cells shows that RSA59 can infect OPCs and form syncytia that is characteristic of infection by the demyelinating MHV strain (D\u2013F). In RSMHV2-infected cultures, several cells were double positive for A2B5 (red) and EGFP (green), however, no syncytia were observed in RSMHV2-infected oligodendrocyte precursors (G\u2013I). Magnification (A\u2013I: 600X). Arrows mark double positive cells.",

Confluent oligodendrocyte precursor enriched cultures were maintained in oligodendrocyte differentiated medium for 7 days and infected with RSA59 or RSMHV2 at a M.O.I. of 1 for 24 h. Virus-infected cells were identified by EGFP (green). Differentiated oligodendrocytes were stained with anti-GalC antibody (marker for differentiated oligodendrocytes, red). Sister cultures of differentiated oligodendrocytes were either mock infected (A\u2013C) or infected with RSA59 (D\u2013F), or with RSMHV2 (G,H). In all three RSA59 infected cultures (D\u2013F) syncytia formation is obvious and there are drastic reductions in the expression of GalC, but in RSMHV2 infected cultures, most of the infected cells were not oligodendrocytes. These data suggest that RSA59 can infect differentiated oligodendrocytes whereas RSMHV2 is unable to infect differentiated oligodendrocytes. Magnification (A\u2013H: 600X). Thick arrows mark differentiated matured oligodendrocytes in (A\u2013C). Thin arrows in (D\u2013F) mark infected mature oligodrndrocytes which formed syncitia. Arrowheads in (G,H) mark the differentiated oligodendrocytes which are not infected by RSMHV2.",
