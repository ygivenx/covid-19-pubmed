This observation correlates well with the higher degree of sequence conservation between bats and human/mouse for intracellular molecules (Table 1). It is worth to note that although the transcription factors Foxp3 and ROR\u03b3t, expressed by CD4+ T regulatory cells (Treg) and CD4+ Th17 cells respectively in human and mice, were also highly conserved in P. alecto, identification of cross-reactive antibodies against these molecules was unsuccessful.",

However, since human/mouse antibodies failed to detect the major lymphocyte surface markers CD4 and CD8 from bat lymphocytes, a strategy based on the expression of transcription factors was adopted to further characterize the T cell subsets. Human and mouse T cell subsets express different transcription factors upon differentiation into effector cells242526. As such, Gata3 has been reported to be the master regulator driving the development of the CD4+ Th2 subset, whereas the CD4+ Th1 subset expresses predominantly Tbet. As for the CD8+ T cell population, co-expression of Tbet and Eomes was described, although Tbet is expressed at an earlier stage than Eomes during the development into effector cells and gets down-regulated later during memory formation2728. Based on the assumption that similar T cell subsets with similar expression pattern of transcription factors exist in bats, we devised the following flow cytometry strategy. Total bat splenocytes were first gated on live single cells, excluding doublets (Fig. 1a). The total lymphocyte population was further defined by its forward and side laser light scatter properties (Fig. 1a). Using cross-reactive anti-CD3 antibody, the CD3+ lymphocyte population was then identified and selected (Fig. 1b). This cell population stained negative for IgG and CD11b, specific markers for B cells and myeloid cells, respectively, further supporting that these CD3+ cells are very likely T lymphocytes (Fig. S1a\u2013c). Tbet, Eomes and Gata3-specific staining of the CD3+ population indicated a prominent (58%) Tbet+ Eomes+ double positive population in this particular bat spleen, which may correspond to CD8+ effector T cells (Fig. 1b). Tbet+ Eomes\u2212 (that could represent the CD4+ Th1 cell population or early activated CD8+ T cells) and Tbet\u2212 Gata3+ population (CD4+ Th2 cells) were also readily detected although the percentages of both cell populations were relatively low compared to the Tbet+ Eomes+ CD3+ lymphocytes (Fig. 1b).",

Thus, simultaneous and combined detection by flow cytometry of protein (using antibodies) and mRNA (using Flow-FISH) at a single cell level is possible33. Here, bat splenocytes were stained with anti-CD3, anti-Eomes, anti-Tbet and anti-Gata3 antibodies followed by in situ hybridization specific to CD4 and CD8 mRNA. Results indicated that 34% and 25% of the CD3+ cells were CD8mRNA+ and CD4mRNA+ respectively (Fig. 2). The fact that these percentages added up to 60% only of the total CD3+ population suggests lower sensitivity of flow-FISH assay compared to antibody staining. In addition, since the specificity and sensitivity for each target mRNA vary from one probe to another; direct quantitative comparison of different cell populations identified by Flow-FISH may be biased. However, it is possible to analyze sub-populations within a specific cell subset identified by Flow-FISH. Here, the combined Flow-FISH and antibody detection approach reveals that majority (75%) of the CD3+ CD8mRNA+ cells co-expressed Tbet and Eomes, and only about 1% expressed Gata3 (Fig. 2b). This result thus validates our FACS strategy based on the differential expression of Eomes, Tbet and Gata3 to identify the CD8+ T cell population. In addition, comparable percentages of CD4mRNA+ and CD8mRNA+ cells that were Tbet+ Eomes\u2212 were observed (13.4 and 10.6%, respectively). This observation thus supports that bat CD3+ Tbet+ Eomes\u2212 cells are likely to represent the CD4+ Th1 subset as well as early activated CD8+ T cells. Among the CD4mRNA+ cells, another 12% expressed Gata3 (which could be CD4+ Th2 cells), and 13% co-expressed Tbet and Eomes. However, the greatest majority of CD4mRNA+ cells were Tbet\u2212 Gata3\u2212 Eomes\u2212 triple negative, which could represent na\u00efve CD4+ T cells or other subsets that could not be identified due to the lack of cross-reactive antibodies.",

Predominance of Tbet+ Eomes+ double positive cells (largely representing the CD8+ T cell population) was confirmed in the spleen from the 4 bats examined (Fig. 3a). In sharp contrast, the T cell subsets from the bone marrow comprises of ~70% Tbet+ single positive T cells (assumed to be CD4+ Th1 cells) and ~30% Tbet+ Eomes+ double positive T cells (CD8+ T cells) (Fig. 3b). The predominant populations in the MLNs were Tbet\u2212 Eomes\u2212 Gata3\u2212 cells (assumed to be CD4+ T cells) and Eomes+ single positive T cells, which have been described as memory CD8+ T cells in other mammals34 (Fig. 3c). In PBMCs, Tbet\u2212 Eomes\u2212 Gata3\u2212 triple negative as well as Gata3+ single positive T cells (both subsets assumed to be CD4+ T cells) dominated (Fig. 3d). Together, the data suggest a predominance of CD8+ T cells in the bat spleen, whereas bone marrow and PBMCs display majority of CD4+ T cells and MLNs harbor similar proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",

Even more strikingly, we found that over 30% of the total leukocytes present in bats bone marrow are CD3+ T cells, which is far greater than the percentage described in human and mouse bone marrow which typically ranges between 4% and 8%35. This finding suggests that in bats the bone marrow may play a major role in T cell hematopoiesis in contrast to other mammals where the thymus usually fulfills this function; this hypothesis is consistent with the fact that we were unable to find the thymus in these wild caught bats.",

Bat splenocytes or PBMCs were stimulated with PDBu and the ionophore ionomycin (activation of protein kinase C bypassing the T cell receptor), in the presence of brefeldin A and monensin that block the Golgi apparatus and allow intracellular accumulation of cytokines produced in response to the stimulation. Cross-reactive anti-human TNF and anti-human IL-10 antibodies, as well as anti-bat IFN-\u03b3 antibody were used to detect by flow cytometry the production of these cytokines. In addition, Flow-FISH was used to detect the production at the mRNA level of IL-2 (T cell growth factor), granzyme B and perforin (cytolytic molecules mainly produced by CD8+ T cells and NK cells103738), IL-17A and IL-22 (inflammatory cytokines produced by Th17 cells) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) (an immunosuppressive cytokine associated with Treg as well as Th17 differentiation3940). Results showed that upon stimulation with PDBu/Iono a great proportion of the CD3+ cells present in the spleen produced TNF and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 5a,b), whereas a smaller percentage produced IL-10 (Fig. 5c). Expectedly, a greater percentage of CD3+ MHCII+ cells produced TNF compared to the MHCII\u2212 T cell population (Fig. S2). Furthermore, TNF production in CD3+ T cell subsets ranged from 23.6% in Tbet\u2212 Eomes\u2212 Gata3\u2212 (representing CD4+ T cells) to 73.5% in Tbet\u2212 Eomes+ T cells (possibly representing CD8+ memory T cells) (Fig. S3a).

More recently, with the genome sequences of a few bat species (including P. alecto) and some of their transcriptomes available20212246, in silico analyses have provided further insights into the genetic makeup of the bat\u2019s immune system. In particular, the identification of immune-related transcripts linked to cytokine production, lymphocyte activation, regulation of apoptosis and regulation of lymphocyte activation were among the most represented transcripts found2022. Transcripts associated with T and B cell identification, activation, inhibition and differentiation have been reported to be similar to other mammals. Interestingly, the absence of NK cell-related genes such as KLRs and CD16 in the transcriptome of various bat species suggests that the NK cell receptor repertoire in bats might be significantly different from that found in other mammals202246.",

            "text": "Firstly, our data revealed a different proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells depending on the organ/tissue examined. In spleen, CD8+ T cells were predominant over the CD4+ T cell subsets. In the lymph nodes, a similar proportion of Eomes\u2212 Tbet\u2212 Gata3\u2212 (CD4+ T cells) and T cells expressing Eomes only (which represents a CD8 memory phenotype in humans and mice) was observed. Instead, Gata3-expressing T cells were predominant in PBMCs suggesting that CD4+ T cells outnumber CD8+ T cells in the blood. Similarly, the bone marrow contained Tbet+ single positive cells (CD4+ Th1 cells) and Tbet+ Eomes+ double positive cells (CD8+ T cells) in a 2 to 1 ratio. Surprisingly, over 30% of leukocytes present in the bats bone marrow are T lymphocytes, a significantly greater percentage than that described in human and mouse bone marrow which ranges between 4% and 8%. Furthermore, the CD4+ to CD8+ T cell ratio in human and mouse bone marrow is reported to be 1 to 235, as opposed to the 2:1 ratio found in bats. This unique T cell profile may suggest that the bat bone marrow assumes the function of the thymus in providing support for T cell development. Alternatively, on-going infection, inflammation and/or autoimmunity could explain the high number of CD4+ T cells in the bone marrow of these wild caught bats47484950. Likewise, predominance of CD8+ T cells in the spleen from these animals may indicate the presence of viruses in this organ or may represent the immune steady state of the bat spleen, specifically geared towards fighting viral infections. Interestingly, when total splenocytes from these bats were incubated with whole dengue virus (DENV) or peptides derived from various viruses including DENV, Nipah and rabies virus, no significant cytokine production and/or cell proliferation could be measured (data not shown). This result indicates that these bats have not been exposed to these viruses before, and may favor the hypothesis that at steady state, bats secondary lymhoid organs such as the spleen have a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells than other mammals. Further investigation in bats bred under specific pathogen free conditions in which an immune steady state or baseline can be established would be required to address these hypotheses.",

In mouse and human, MHCII+ IgG-expressing B cells are B cells that have previously encountered and interacted with their cognate specific antigen, and undergone antibody isotype switching as part of their activation and differentiation process. They can be either antibody secreting cells (plasmablasts) or long lived memory B cells5152. The fact that most of the bat B cells examined are IgG+ thus suggests that these cells are antigen-primed B cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation of their B cell receptor. This finding is not very surprising and likely reflects that these wild-caught bats have been exposed to antigens from various pathogens and other sources. Further characterization of bat B cells includes assessing the ability of these cells to present antigens and to respond to specific stimulation such as TLR agonists or anti-Ig antibodies, and their ability to secrete antibodies.",

It is worth noting that Th17 cells have been reported to play an active role in tumor regression which is tempting to link to the low level of tumor-related mortality reported in bats53. As for Tregs, their role is to suppress or negatively regulate virus-induced CD8+ T cell-mediated inflammation, in order to prevent extensive tissue damage.
