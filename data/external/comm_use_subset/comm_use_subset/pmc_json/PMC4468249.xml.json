From the 5th day, diagnosis depends mainly on detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies using ELISA methods [7, 8]. Therefore, both virus and antibody detection are crucial for the identification of infected cases. The reference method of DENV diagnosis is virus isolation [9, 10], which takes a week and requires highly equipped laboratories. The most widely used methods are antigen detection in ELISA or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) formats [8]. Antigen detection is based on the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the DENV [11]. RDTs are fast (10\u201315 minutes) and suitable for point-of-care screening. However, RDTs clinical sensitivity (21\u201399%) and specificity (77%\u201398%) vary greatly [7, 8, 12, 13]. The gold standard method for molecular detection of DENV is real-time RT-PCR, which detects DENV RNA within 60\u201390 minutes [14\u201316]. Real-time RT-PCR is highly sensitive and specific [14, 16\u201318]. It requires precautions (carry over prevention systems and physical separation of pipetting sites), sophisticated equipment, and is cold chain dependent, which makes it difficult to implement at the point-of-need.",

There is only one development for the application of Nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [19] but several applications of reverse transcription Loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for the detection and differentiation of DENV serotypes have been described [20\u201323]. RT-LAMP reactions are performed at 60\u00b0C, tests run for more than 30 minutes, and results are measured either by turbidity index or by visual qualitative fluorescence detection of SYBR Green [24]. In contrast, real-time recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) amplifies at 39\u201342\u00b0C and uses a fluorescent exo-probe for detection [25]. The RPA assay is very fast (3\u201315 minutes) and can be operated on a portable device, the tubescanner (19x17.5 cm). In this study, a-point-of-need reverse transcription RPA (RT-RPA) assays for the detection of DENV1-4 without differentiation between the serotypes were developed and evaluated with samples from Senegal and Thailand. A mobile RPA unit was deployed to Kedougou in Senegal and to Bangkok, Thailand.",

            "text": "In Bangkok, Thailand, the RNA of ninety plasma samples extracted and tested between 2012\u20132013 by RT-PCR, and stored at -80\u00b0C was tested. RNA was simultaneously screened by RT-RPA assays and serotype specific real-time RT-PCR (S1 Table). The sensitivity was 72% and 94.4% for RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR, respectively (S3 Table). RT-RPA assays sensitivities for DENV serotypes were 66.6% (16/24), 44% (4/9), 80.9% (34/42), and 60% (6/10) for DENV1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Five samples were only positive in RT-RPA and therefore the DENV serotype was not determined. No correlation was found between threshold time values of RT-RPA and Ct of the real-time RT-PCR (S6 Fig, R2 = 0.179).",

It should be rapid, sensitive, specific, stable at high temperatures (>30\u00b0C), and cheap. Currently point-of-care DENV detection is carried out with RDT assays. RDTs are simple and rapid but of limited sensitivity and specificity [7, 13]. Real-time RT-PCR is highly sensitive, usually performed in highly equipped laboratories and not suitable for point-of-care testing. In contrast, RPA technology is as sensitive and specific as real-time RT-PCR, isothermal and easy to use at point-of-need [26, 29\u201335]. In addition, RPA is fast (3\u20135 minutes including the reverse transcription step) and can be performed on a portable device (tubescanner). In this study, two RT-RPA assays for detection of DENV (DENV1-3 and DENV4) were developed which cover but do not differentially determine DENV1-4, as required for molecular epidemiological studies. Distinguishing DENV1-4 at the point-of-care is not clinically relevant. The assays were very sensitive with a respective limit of detection of 241 and 14 molecules detected, highly specific, and were evaluated as mobile tests in a low resource setting in Kedougou in Senegal.",

While SYBR Green detection of the RT-LAMP reaction could basically also be done with the tubescanner, RPA is much faster (3\u201315 minutes) and utilizes only three oligonucleotides (two primers, one exo-P). Recent advances in software development to assist LAMP design may help overcome challenges for highly variant viruses, the tolerance for mismatches in LAMP assays however still needs to be explored [40]. The tolerance of RPA oligonucleotide sets and in particular, of the exo-P probe portions to mismatches [26, 33] are advantageous for RPA amplicon design but remain subject to testing.",

Efficient RPA tolerates mismatches per primer which should not accumulate at the termini or at the center of the primers and in concordance with what is known about PCR primers mismatches at the 3\u2019 end of the primers impede the RPA reaction [42]. As a whole RPA amplification systems appear to tolerate the presence of 5\u20139 mismatches in a primer and probe set [26, 33]. We assume that the long 32 nt 5\u2019 section of DEN RPA P3, which matches almost perfectly to DENV1-4, allows for tolerance of the accumulation of the mismatches in the smaller 3\u2019 portion of the probe since it does not conflict with the principle of dissociation of the smaller section the exo-P after Exonuclease action. Shifting the mismatches into the smaller section of the probes may thus be exploited for the design of exo-P for the detection of other highly variable RNA target sequences. In contrast, real-time PCR, which utilized shorter primers and probes, is more sensitive to the presence of mismatches in the target sequence [43]. The linearity of the assay also does not represent a correlation of linearity and sensitivity as seen in real-time PCR assays [29].",

A magnetic bead extraction was applied to avoid the creation of aerosols and because trials at the Institute Pasteur in Paris in a climate chamber have shown that most commercial centrifuges short-circuited at 80% humidity and temperatures above 38\u00b0C (Jean-Claude Manuguerra, personal communication). All reagents were cold chain independent and performed well at 38\u201340\u00b0C ambient temperature. We were able to run the laboratory in the open air and observed no influence of dust on the assay quality. We will continue to follow this concept to allow easy deployment of up to date molecular detection to infrastructure poor settings. Further work will attempt to reduce pipetting steps by drying RPA primers and probe into the RPA reagent pellet, implementing a multiplex RT-RPA assay combining the two DENV RPA assays into one reaction and identifying even simpler extraction protocols.",

            "text": "The DENV RT-RPA assays were evaluated with plasma samples and RNA extracts in Senegal and Thailand. The RT-RPA clinical sensitivities were 98% for samples tested in Senegal and 72% for RNA extracts in Thailand, whereas real-time RT-PCR sensitivity was 98% and 94.4%, respectively. The lower clinical sensitivity of the RT-RPA assays on the RNA extracts in Thailand might not be due to the assay detection limit, which is between 10\u2013100 RNA copies (Figs 3, 4 and 5). As shown in S3 Table, most of the samples, which were negative in RT-RPA had Ct values between 14\u201330 in real-time RT-PCR. Genetic variations between Asian and African DENV strain could not be the reason for the difference in the assay sensitivity [44\u201347]. As mentioned above, the RPA targeted the conserved 3\u2019 NTR of the DENV genome and RPA amplification can tolerate 5\u20139 mismatches. In Senegal, RNA was extracted from plasma samples and screened directly with the RT-RPA assays, while in Thailand, RNA stored at -80\u00b0C for 6\u201318 months was tested. The integrity of the RNA is affected by freezing and thawing, albeit, freezing of clinical samples has a less pronounced effect [48, 49]. It appears that in contrast to real-time RT-PCR [50], RT-RPA performance is influenced by the quality of the RNA confirming an observation we described earlier [26].",
