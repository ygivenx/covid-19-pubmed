            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gamma coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, which has been identified as the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (IB) as well as serious acute viral respiratory and urogenital diseases in commercial chickens flocks worldwide [1,2]. Infected chickens develop respiratory symptoms, kidney and oviduct lesions, reduced egg production with poor egg quality, and possible secondary complications [3,4]. IBV can replicate within the epithelial surfaces of the kidneys and cause granular degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of the tubular epithelium, and massive infiltration of heterophils in the interstitium. IBV-induced kidney lesions are typically characterized by interstitial nephritis and tubule lesions that are most prominent in the medulla [5,6].",

            "text": "Interactions between viruses and hosts occur at two levels: viral capacity to gain access to the target cell and competition between the viruses and host cells to control the cellular protein synthesis machinery. The virus/host interactions are largely determined by the virulence of the pathogen and the host immune response [7], and may lead to changes in host gene expression. However, many aspects of IBV-host interactions remain unclear. Elucidation of the basis of the interactions between IBV and kidney cells will provide new insights into the immune mechanisms underlying host antiviral strategies and the pathogenesis of viral infection. To date, a limited number of studies have examined host gene expression in response to IBV infection on a relatively large scale using microarrays or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis [8,9]. Gene expression alterations in avian embryonic tissues infected with IBV isolate B8358 were evaluated using a microarray containing 1191 unique chicken and turkey gene transcripts. Regulated expression has been established with several functional gene classes and pathways, including those coding kinases, interferon (IFN)-induced genes, chemokines, adhesins, vesicular trafficking and fusion proteins genes, extracellular matrix protein genes, the cell cycle, cell metabolism, physiology, and development, translation, RNA binding, lysosomal protein degradation and ubiquitination-related genes [10]. In addition, the gene transcription profiles of tracheal epithelial cells were examined 3 days postinfection with an attenuated IBV-Massachusetts strain [11]. These authors investigated 25 direct immune-related genes and found an up-regulation in toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR3, IFN-induced antiviral genes (Mx), and genes responsible for cytotoxic T cell killing, such as the Fas antigen and granzyme-A. More recently, changes in ex vivo and in ovo protein expression in Vero cells as well as chicken trachea and kidney tissues were reported after IBV infection [8,9,12,13]. However, there is limited information available regarding transcriptomics of host kidney cells in response to IBV infection. The current study was designed to compare the transcriptomes of kidney cells in IBV-infected chickens to those of control chickens. A subset of genes of interest identified by microarray analysis was validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The putative importance of some of these genes in IBV pathogenesis and immune response were also analyzed. The global gene expression profiling of chicken kidney tissue after nephropathogenic IBV infection will enable a better understanding of the pathogenesis of IBV infection and extend the knowledge of the nature of virus-host interactions.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report to use microarray technology to acquire a global profile of host gene expression in chicken kidney cells after IBV infection. Herein, we identified 1777 genes that were differentially regulated more than three-fold compared to the corresponding control group and mostly associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, 12 of the immune and inflammatory response DE genes were validated by qRT-PCR. Genes that were differentially expressed during infection can potentially provide insight into the complex regulatory phenomena in response to IBV infection. In our previous study, we identified expression alterations of 53 proteins in kidney tissues of chickens infected with another nephropathogenic IBV strain, ck/CH/LDL/97I, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis [8,9]. The shared proteins/genes identified by the two methods were mainly involved in oxidoreductase, receptor binding, and transferase activities, whereas some were associated with immune responses. This might be at least due to the different sampling timepoints and the different virulence of viruses used for infecting chickens. The IBV strain ck/CH/LDL/091022 used in this study is highly nephropathogenic and more virulent than ck/CH/LDL/97I [14]. For Newcastle disease virus, it was reported that the more virulent strain persisted longer in the birds and, therefore, was able to increase the magnitude and duration of cell-mediated immunity [18].",

Activation of the innate immune system relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specific pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) [19]. TLR4, TLR5, TLR15, and TLR16 belong to the TLR family and are involved in sensing and initiating immune responses to viral infection [20]. All of the TLRs were significantly up-regulated after IBV infection. Reportedly, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection can also induce TLR4 expression [21], suggesting that TLR4 possibly has a similar effect both in avian and mammalian species as well as during coronavirus infection. Similar to the present results, a previous study reported that the transcription level of TLR15, a poultry-specific TLR, was significantly up-regulated after infection with Marek\u2019s disease virus [22], infectious bursa disease virus infection [23], and avian influenza virus H9N2-infected chickens in the lungs [24], implicating a similar role of TLR15 in sensing and initiating responses to viruses after infection.",

IBV can induce acute IFN-\u03b1 production [29] and the ability to induce IFN is linked to the virulence and adaptability of the IBV strain to a particular host system [30,31]. In this study, IFN expression was not significantly upregulated after IBV infection; however, some IRFs and ISGs, such as IRF1, IRF7, IRF8, IRF10, NF-kB, STAT1, MyD88, OSAL, MX1, IFIT5, ISG12-2, RSAD2, IFI35, and IFI27L2 were all up-regulated. Therefore, we hypothesized that IFN might be induced during early infection, as indicated by the subsequent enhanced production of ISGs because increased expression of a variety of ISGs, such as OSAL, MX1, IFIT5, ISG12-2, RSAD2, IFI35, protein kinase R (PKR), and IFI27L2, was found in this study. STAT proteins form homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes to activate transcription of some ISGs [32]. Similar to the results in the current study, a previous report showed that STAT1 expression was significantly increased response to IBV infection in ovo[10], suggesting that IBV infection can activate the JAK-STAT pathway and activate transcription of ISGs. MX1 is a dynamin-like large guanosinetriphosphatase (GTPase), which has antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses [33]. PKR (also known as EIF2\u03b1K2) is constitutively expressed as an inactive kinase that is activated by viral double-stranded RNA and plays an important role in the cellular antiviral response pathway. OASL is a member of the OAS gene family, which in combination with RNaseL constitutes an antiviral RNA decay pathway [34]. The activation of both OAS and PKR results in global degradation of cellular RNA and translation inhibition, which may also inhibit viral propagation [28]. In addition, we found that the MxGTPase pathway, the protein kinase R pathway, and the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate-synthetase-directed ribonuclease L pathway might be involved in anti-IBV infection, but the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway was not. These pathways might exert their effects through different mechanisms of action, such as direct targeting of viral entry, inhibition of protein synthesis, or degradation of viral RNA [35], and play an important role in anti-IBV responses and host defense during IBV infection.",

In this study, increased expression of IL6, IL18, IL10RA, IL17RA, CCL4, CCL20, CCL17, and CCL19 was observed after IBV infection; however, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 expression was found to be decreased. IL6 was also up-regulated during other nidovirus infections, such as SARS-CoV, porcine respiratory coronavirus, equine arteritis virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [37-39]. These findings suggested that IL6, IL18, and IL10 may have similar functions in IBV infection as those in other coronavirus infections. The important negative regulators SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were significantly up-regulated in this study. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 participate in the feedback system of IL6 signal transduction by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of a component of the IL6 receptor gp130 [40]. The observed changes in expression of IL6, SOCS-1, and SOCS-3 in kidney tissues of IBV-infected chickens suggested a balance between pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which seemed to be critical for IBV pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Our data also presented an interesting set of apoptosis-related genes after IBV infection. In this study, the expression of the Fas, caspase (casp) 1, casp9, casp18, Bcl-2L1, BCL2-antagonist/killer 1, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a genes was significantly increased compared to the control group. The caspase proteins are executioners of apoptosis [41]. Extrinsic signals to initiate the apoptotic pathways from receptors (e.g., Fas ligand) culminate in the activation of caspase 8, which activates the effector caspase 3, while intrinsic signaling requires the participation of the mitochondria in releasing cytochrome c to activate caspase 9 for the downstream activation of caspase 3. Both pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax and Bak) and anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) from the Bcl-2 family are key proteins in the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway [28]. Recent reports have suggested that IBV also triggers apoptosis during the late stages of its cytolytic infection cycle. Similar results were found in IBV-infected Vero cells at 24 h postinfection, revealing an up-regulation at the transcriptional level of both pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-survival Mcl-1, which may play essential roles in maintaining the intricate balance between life and death of infected cells to ensure a successful infection cycle [42]. Taken together, it can be hypothesized that IBV activates apoptosis through Fas/FasL activation and mitochondrial-dependent pathways, similar to that of TGEV [43,44]. Furthermore, Bak and Mcl-1 may play key roles in the regulation of IBV-induced apoptosis, not only at an early stage of infection in vitro, but also at a late stage of infection in vivo. In other words, apoptosis is a nonspecific defense mechanism against IBV infection through abortion of viral multiplication by premature lysis of infected cells.",

The analysis of the global profile of host gene expression provided a good overview of host response to IBV infection and is helpful for understanding IBV mechanism of disease or death. The results also provided basic information needed to extend our understanding of the nature of the virus-host interactions. However, analysis of the innate host immune response in kidneys at those time points may not be sufficient to completely understand IBV immunologic mechanisms. In addition, the roles of individual cell types in this response cannot be effectively measured in this way. Therefore, further analysis of the above-mentioned concerns is warranted. Given the consistent utilization of current vaccines and the continued emergence of new virulent IBV genotypes throughout the world, the development of better vaccines and control strategies will require a greater understanding of pathogenic mechanisms.",
