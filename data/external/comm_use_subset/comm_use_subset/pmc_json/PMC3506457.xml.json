            "text": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) is a crucial transcription factor regulating multiple cellular pathways leading to survival or death of the cell depending on the stimulus. In unstimulated cells, the NF-\u03baB dimers (p50/p65 heterodimer or p50/p50 homodimer) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B (I\u03baB). Upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 (IL-1), CD40L, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) etc., signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1 exposes the p50/p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF-\u03baB dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to \u03baB motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription\n[1].",

On the contrary, many pathogens such as African swine fever virus, HIV-1 and cowpox virus\n[3-5] have developed strategies to interfere with host NF-\u03baB responses.

In human hepatoma cells, ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP and heterologous expression of the ORF2 protein led to reduced recruitment of SKP1 and CUL1 subunits to the SCF\u03b2TRCP ubiquitination complex, resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein. This, in turn, led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent DNA binding of the p65 protein, which is the major subunit of the NF-\u03baB trans-activation complex. Analysis of two NF-\u03baB target genes further confirmed the above observation. The possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of HEV infected hepatocytes is discussed.",

This vector was inducible by NF-\u03baB activating agents like TPA or IL-1\u03b2. Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-\u03baB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids. Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF-\u03baB CAT activity (Figure\n1A). However, no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression (Figure\n1A). In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity was an artifact of the experimental system, cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), a known inducer of NF-\u03baB activity\n[11], or transfected with an expression construct of I\u03baB kinase \u03b2, which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF-\u03baB activity\n[12]. TPA treatment increased NF-\u03baB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF-\u03baB activity (Figure\n1A). Similarly, co-expression of ORF2 in IKK\u03b2 transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF-\u03baB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKK\u03b2 (Figure\n1B). These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF-\u03baB activity.",

By performing a pulse chase assay, using 35S]-cys/met labeling mix, the half-life of I\u03baB\u03b1 in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes, whereas in cells expressing both IKK\u03b2 and ORF2, approximately 15% of I\u03baB\u03b1 was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes (Figure\n2A). Notably, the levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the end of the labeling period (0 minute chase) in IKK\u03b2 alone expressing cells were less than that in IKK\u03b2 and ORF2 coexpressing cells, indicating that I\u03baB\u03b1 is a very labile protein in IKK\u03b2 expressing cells. The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of I\u03baB\u03b1 at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100%. To further confirm whether I\u03baB\u03b1 stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in ORF2 expressing cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody. As seen in Figure\n2B, ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction (Figure\n2B, lane 2 and 4; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below). As expected, mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction (Figure\n2B, lane 1 and 3). This is attributed to the fact that basal NF-\u03baB activity is higher in Huh7 cells\n[13]. In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls, equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin and anti-phospho c-Jun antibodies.",

Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody to check the levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 (3rd panel). A parallel set of samples were labeled with [35S]-cys/met and immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody to check the expression of ORF2 (Figure\n3B, 4th panel). To further check whether the ORF2 expression in these cells inhibited the association of I\u03baB\u03b1 with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP, ORF2 and myc tagged \u03b2TRCP co-expressing cells were labeled with [35S]-cys/met and aliquots of the lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody and immunoblotted using anti-I\u03baB\u03b1 antibody.

Alternatively, it binds to \u03b2TRCP itself and blocks the formation of the SCF complex. We thus checked the association of ORF2 with the above components. No interaction was detected between ORF2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 (Figure\n3C, lane 6) as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay. The possibility that \u03b2TRCP over-expression might be promoting ORF2 association with I\u03baB\u03b1 was ruled out by testing ORF2 and I\u03baB\u03b1 association in full-length or \u0394F- \u03b2TRCP over-expressing cells (Figure\n3D, lane 7 and 8). Lane 1 shows the level of I\u03baB\u03b1 in control cells. Subsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interacts with SKP1 and CUL1. The ORF2 protein did not associate with either SKP1 or CUL1 (Figure\n3D, lane 1 and 2) under conditions, where IKB\u03b1 associated with these proteins (lane 3).",

Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of ORF2 with another F-box protein, SKP2. We were unable to detect any interaction between ORF2 and SKP2 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay (Figure\n4B, top panel). In order to ensure that SKP2 was indeed functional in these experiments, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody. Endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein (Figure\n4B, middle panel) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein (Figure\n4B, lane 4, upper and middle panels).

The viral antigens are presented through their association with the major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I).

As a control to check whether the observed phenomenon was specific for NF-\u03baB, aliquots of the LPS treated lysate were immunoprecipitated with anti-SP1 antibody (specific for SP1 transcription factor, which also binds to MHC-I heavy chain promoter) and purified ChIP DNA was PCR amplified using MHC-I heavy chain promoter specific primer.

No other function of ORF2 protein has yet been reported. In this article, we present evidence which suggest that the ORF2 protein may be playing an important regulatory role during the viral life cycle. The fact that the observed phenomenon was not an artifact of the experimental setup was evident from multiple experiments. First, ORF2 was capable of directly interacting with the F-box protein \u03b2TRCP, both in vitro and in vivo. Second, \u039435 ORF2 mutant that is unable to translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was also capable of inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity, thus ruling out the possibility of ER stress induced artifact. Third, ORF3 protein of HEV was unable to elicit such a function in parallel experiments.",

Although self-limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate ~1\u20132%, a high 10\u201320% mortality rate is observed during pregnancy\n[6]. Hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which HEV completes its life cycle inside the host. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that NF-\u03baB activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients\n[9]. Our findings that the ORF2 protein has the ability to inhibit NF-\u03baB activity in human hepatoma cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation.",

Hence it is worth speculating that the ORF2 \u03b2TRCP interaction would occur in the cytoplasm. Although ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro-translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm, where it is detected as a non-glycosylated protein. Importantly, in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates, retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm\n[16]. Thus, cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with \u03b2TRCP. Indeed, experiments done using \u039435 ORF2 protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with \u03b2TRCP and inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity. Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism.",

In an infected cell, by default, pathogenic antigens are processed by the proteasome and presented by the MHC class I molecules so that the former can be recognized by cytolytic T cells. This helps in pathogen clearance at an early stage of infection. Thus, it is beneficial for any pathogen to escape this step. In fact, downregulation of MHC class I both at transcriptional and post-translational level is observed in many pathogenic infections\n[17-19]. Since NF-\u03baB is one of the major transcription factors induced during pathogen infection that enhances gene expression of many chemokines and class I molecules in the infected cell, inhibition of the NF-\u03baB activity by pathogen encoded proteins will ensure evasion of host immune response at an early stage; thus providing the pathogen a time window to establish successful infection.",

However, whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects, can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus. Nevertheless, the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event.",
