There are many outstanding questions regarding its pathogenic potential, despite evidence for its detrimental effects on human health such as gastroenteritis and extraintestinal diseases [1\u20137]. Also, some food and waterborne outbreaks have been traced to P. shigelloides [8\u201313], and the incidence of Plesiomonas infections linked to immunocompromised health [14] is increasing, especially in light of present-day lifestyles [15]. Climate change and global warming are also predicted to contribute to increased incidence of waterborne infectious diseases including Plesiomonas infections [16\u201319].",

Retrospective reviews of infections due to P. shigelloides in China and Hong Kong have been published [38], and cases of P. shigelloides co-infection with viral and bacterial diarrheal pathogens are common in the literature [39]. Prevalence of P. shigelloides gastroenteritis varies considerably across regions, with lower rates reported from North America and Europe and higher estimates from Southeast Asia and Africa [40]. Nonetheless, there is a general underestimation of P. shigelloides infection, in part because it shares some clinical manifestations with other pathogens [38]. P. shigelloides is not routinely examined in clinical settings, and as such, awareness regarding this pathogen remains limited.",

Matrices are built from publication dataset (e.g.; authors, words, countries, references, keywords) for coupling, co-citation, collaboration, conceptual framework and multiple correspondence analyses. Bibliographic coupling occurs between two articles \u2148 and \u2149 when their reference lists cited at least one common source [62]. But, in a collaboration network, the nodes comprise authors and the links co-authorships [63]. The number of bibliographic coupling that occurs between articles \u2148 and \u2149 or co-authorship in scientific collaboration network denotes the strength of the network [61]. A network depicts relationships in a system as a set of nodes (components) and links (relationships) [64]. Co-Word or conceptual framework analysis explore K-means clustering and other dimensionality reduction techniques to identify clusters of common concepts known in a bibliographic collection. It relies on word co-occurrences in a publication dataset [61,64]. Scientific productivity or an author\u2019s contributions in a field is evaluated in term of Lotka\u2019s law [65]. The Lotka\u2019s law is an inverse square law that describes how often authors published in a field [65].",

To obtain subject-specific results and for the sake of accuracy (in order to avoid false-positive results), only article titles were searched. A title-specific search has been reported to increase recovery and specificity with a minimal loss of sensitivity compared to a topic search [44,45,66]. Articles were downloaded in the BibTeX file format. In order to account for variations in country population on rate of scientific production, the world population was retrieved from the World Bank website (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) and the mid-period population corresponding to the top 19 countries was extracted for calculation of article per million populations.

We found that the number of research articles on P. shigelloides increased non-linearly from 5 to 155 articles. However, a negative trend in rate of increase was noted (\u22120.8%) suggesting that research on P. shigelloides has not been of broad interest in the past 27 years, likely due to discontinuation of Plesiomonas-related research by certain authors and differences in regional distribution of the microorganism. Furthermore, the function estimates and goodness-of-fit indicated that scientific output on P. shigelloides does not follow Lotka\u2019s law, suggesting that the number of articles related to Plesiomonas research will further decline in the future. In general, emerging and re-emerging bacterial pathogens are not accorded the same degree of attention as their viral counterparts. Health emergencies (e.g., outbreaks of infection) relating to emerging viral pathogens including Zika and Chikungunya viruses have driven the generation of new scientific knowledge, resulting in a significant increase in the number of research articles on these subjects [68]. For instance, in 2005 only eight articles were published on Chikungunya virus, but by 2014, the number had reached 302 [69]. Similarly, only 43 articles on Ebola virus were published in 2013 prior to the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, but this increased to more than 600 articles in 2014 [70].",

It has been suggested that the economic strength (growth) of a nation influences the research output [43,71\u201373].

Others focused on P. shigelloides hemolytic expression; serological analysis of the Plesiomonas core; and multilocus sequence typing of Plesiomonas and its pathogenic potential. The United States and Sweden dominated the list of top 20 countries most actively researching Plesiomonas in terms of numbers of articles and citations. In addition to economic strength and availability of research facilities and funding [43,71\u201373], this productivity can be ascribed to a high level of intra-national and possibly multinational collaboration with other institutions, which can impact research visibility and citation frequency [43,73,75]. In particular, the dominance of the United States has been noted in other fields of research [42,54,76,77]. Also, authors\u2019 multiple affiliations influence country collaboration network. Conversely, the low contributions from developing countries including countries from Africa characterized by a high frequency of self-funded or independent studies [78], mirror the situation of research in other fields. The shift in rank among the top 20 nations most active in the Plesiomonas research field when productivity was measured based on total citation per country ought not be regarded as a precise measure of productivity. Citation rate does not reflect publication output of an author or country [76], since the smaller the number of articles used for estimation, the larger the impact of a few frequently cited articles [76]. Self-citations and inaccurate citations can also provide false quality metrics [76].",

Alliances between developing and developed countries are rare in a number of scientific areas [78]. Among researchers in the United States, collaboration pathways were largely intra-national, as suggested by a large number of publications but 6 multiple country publications. In contrast, collaborations by authors in Cuba, Finland, Czech Republic, Italy, Slovakia, and Sweden tended to be multi-national, which is more valuable for the epidemiological control of pathogens.
