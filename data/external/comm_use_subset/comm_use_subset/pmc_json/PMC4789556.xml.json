Their evaluation is approached from different perspectives. First, we describe features associated with each dataset and their respective attributes. Second, the databases are compared in terms of shape and size of the epidemic curves generated from the data in each. Finally, different qualitative aspects (usefulness, simplicity, flexibility, quality of data, acceptability, representativeness, and timeliness and stability) are described and compared in order to identify strengths and weaknesses and assess their potential application to the surveillance for SECD. The report here contributes to understand the nature and extent of the data collected to monitor PEDV and PDCoV in the US and helps to establish the baseline information on the SECD epidemiological dynamics after 2 years of disease spread in the country.",

Federal, state, and tribal animal health officials use the EMRS to record and view animal disease data, manage incident response services and resources, and create reports and maps to facilitate disease investigations and associated epidemiological analyses. On June 5, 2014, according to the Federal Order (FO) issued by the USDA, the EMRS was designated as the official system for the recording of all SECD situation data collection, information management, and reporting. The FO mandated the reporting of SECD cases (16). The EMRS also received testing data provided by the NAHLN laboratories. The NAHLN data were electronically transmitted into the EMRS to facilitate the response activities. The emergency response officials investigated all the SECD case reports that were initiated by sharing the lab results or other communication channels and determined the SECD status of each reported herd/premise. On the basis of lab test results and consultations with herd owners and herd veterinarians, the premises received a status of confirmed or presumptive positive for PEDV, PDCoV, or both viruses. In accordance with the USDA case definition, a confirmed positive herd/premise was a site with animals that had at least one positive for PEDV or PDCoV to a PCR test and a history of clinical signs consistent with SECD, whereas a presumptive herd/premise had animals that tested positive for either disease without manifesting clinical signs (17, 18). The status of the premises was reported into the EMRS as soon as a federal or state official had confirmed all the information sources required and the status could be updated, modified, or closed until the new information became available.",

The SHMP data were spread over an extended period of time, suggesting a lower transmission rate compared to what may be estimated using the EMRS data \u2013 noteworthy, NAHLN data would not allow estimating a transmission rate. In the NAHLN and EMRS, many reports were concentrated at the beginning of the curve, likely, because they included a number of reports that occurred earlier in the epidemic. In contrast, in the winter of 2014\u20132015, when the three databases had been in place for almost 2 years, all the epidemic curves pointed toward an increase of PEDV incidence versus the previous summer levels, which is particularly evident from data in the EMRS database.

Although the disease dynamics seemed to be slightly different between states, probably associated with different times of disease introduction, demographic, and epidemiological conditions; the most swine-densely populated states showed similar trends over time, suggesting that the pattern observed in the entire country is not just a reflection of what occurred in Iowa (Figure 3).",

First, a new Laboratory Messaging System (LMS), data management system, was launched to store and manage all PEDV testing data. This new data system was the USDA\u2019s repository for laboratory testing data and was connected to other key data systems, including EMRS. The LMS provided a system to transmit testing data electronically to USDA by using HL7 electronic result messaging technology. As of March 2015, five NAHLN laboratories were electronically messaging their PEDV test results to USDA rather than providing weekly data files. Another major change included the requirement of the premises identification data with the laboratory records. However, even with this requirement, the PEDV laboratory test records often did not include the premises identifiers, since the individual lab policies or the premises information were not provided by the submitters. The inclusion of the national premises identification data with the testing records slowly increased from 40% in June 2014 to nearly 90% in October 2014. In terms of flexibility, logistics for implementation of the EMRS was more complex, and consequently, its adaptation to new situations required more time and effort than the NAHLN or the SHMP.",
