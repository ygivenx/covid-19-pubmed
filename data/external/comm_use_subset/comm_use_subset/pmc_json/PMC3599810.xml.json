            "text": "Natural Killer (NK) cells were initially characterised by their spontaneous lytic activity against certain tumor and virus-infected cells [1,2]. Besides their role as cytotoxic cells through the production of perforin and granzymes, NK cells are potent producers of cytokines like Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [3] and thus play important roles in immunomodulation and the defence against viral, parasitic and bacterial pathogens [4]. A considerable number of phenotypically and functionally different NK-cell subsets have been identified up to date [5]. For example, human NK cells can be divided into functionally and also developmentally distinct subsets according to their differing expression of CD56 in combination with CD16 [6,7] and more recently CD11b and CD27 [8]. In the mouse likewise CD27 and CD11b (Mac-1) are used to dissect NK cells into functionally and developmentally different subsets [9]. Additionally, the chemokine receptor CXCR3 is used in combination with CD27 to distinguish NK-cell subsets in the mouse [10].",

Moreover, in parasitic as well as in viral infections increases in NK cell number and activity have been reported [14,15], but also inhibitory effects on NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production by viral infections are described [16-19]. Despite these hints on important functions of porcine NK cells in vivo, so far no investigations on the existence of functionally differing NK-cell subsets have been reported. Nevertheless, a recent study from our group with newly developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the activating receptor NKp46 enabled a more comprehensive insight into the phenotype of porcine NK cells and putative subsets [20].",

In contrast, NKp46 in the pig was shown to divide porcine CD3-CD8\u03b1+ NK cells into NKp46- and NKp46+ subsets in blood and all organs tested [20]. CD3-CD8\u03b1+NKp46- NK cells show phenotypic and functional properties of NK cells although they produce reduced levels of IFN-\u03b3 compared to the NKp46+ subset after in vitro stimulation. Additionally, a third NK cell population with elevated NKp46 expression levels was identified in high frequencies in spleen and liver, pointing towards a special role of NK cells with this phenotype.",

The following primary antibodies were used for cell surface staining: unconjugated or Alexa647-conjugated anti-NKp46 (IgG1, clone VIV-KM1, [20]), anti-CD3 (IgG2b, clone BB23-8E6, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-CD3 (IgG2a, clone BB23-8E6-8C8, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), eFluor450-conjugated anti-CD3 (IgG1, clone PPT3, custom-conjugation by eBioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), unconjugated or FITC-conjugated anti-CD8\u03b1 (IgG2a, clone 11/295/33), PE-conjugated anti-CD8\u03b1 (IgG2a, clone 76-2-11, BD Biosciences), anti-CD16 (IgG1, clone G7, Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA), Biotin-conjugated anti-CD27 (IgG1, clone b30c7, [37]). All non-commercial monoclonal antibodies were produced in-house [38]. Where indicated, these antibodies had been purified and covalently conjugated to fluorochromes or Biotin. Alexa Fluor-647 Protein Labelling Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used for conjugation of anti-NKp46 mAbs according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. FITC conjugation for anti-CD8\u03b1 mAbs was performed as described elsewhere [39]. Anti-CD27 mAbs were biotinylated using Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific, Pierce, Vienna, Austria) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Unspecific binding was assessed by appropriate isotype-matched control antibodies. For indirect labelling, anti-mouse anti-IgG1-PE (Southern Biotech) and Streptavidin-Brilliant Violet 605 conjugate (BioLegend, San Jose, CA, USA) were used as second-step reagents. To discriminate between live and dead cells, Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies) was used according manufacturer\u2019s protocol with 0.05 \u03bcL reactive dye per reaction. If unconjugated and conjugated antibodies with the same isotype were used in combination, a sequential staining was performed. Unconjugated primary mAb was used in a first step, followed by isotype-specific dye-conjugated antibodies. After secondary incubation, free binding sites of mouse-isotype specific antibodies were blocked by whole mouse IgG molecules (2 \u03bcg per sample, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK) followed by a further incubation step with fluorochrome-conjugated primary mAbs.",

The internal standard (IS) was generated by pooling equal aliquots of the cDNA samples investigated in this study. Primers for target genes were designed using either the public domain programmes Primer3 [43] or Primer-BLAST [44] for CXCR3. All primers were synthesised commercially (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany). Sequence information of used primers is listed in Table 1. Whenever possible, primers were forced to span over exon junctions in order to increase specificity. For amplification of target genes SYBR\u00ae green I (0.5\u00d7, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as reporter dye. The qPCR reaction-mixes contained iTaq\u00ae DNA polymerase (0.3 U/reaction, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), gene specific primers (250 nmol/L each), a final concentration of 200 \u03bcmol/L dNTP each and 3 mmol/L MgCl2 (for CXCR3 1.5 mmol/L were used) within provided reaction buffer (1\u00d7, Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed on a CFX96\u2122 (Bio-Rad), PCR conditions are listed in Additional file 1. Optimisation and validation of the qPCR assays with target gene-specific primers are likewise described in more detail in Additional file 1. Specificity of the generated PCR products using a cDNA pool of samples was further verified by automated sequencing using the pGEM-T Easy vector system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and M13 standard sequencing primer (Eurofins MWG Operon). The multiplex qPCR assay for the reference genes (\u03b2-Actin, Cyclophilin A and GAPDH) that were used to normalise each target-gene expression was performed as previously described [45]. Each plate contained corresponding randomly assigned RT-minus controls (10% of all samples investigated), the no-template controls (NTC), as well as the IS. All samples were measured in duplicates.",

A gating hierarchy was used throughout the experiments to exclude doublets, dead cells as well as CD3+ T cells. Remaining CD3- lymphocytes were further analysed for CD8\u03b1 and NKp46 expression (see Additional file 2). As previously described [20], among CD3- lymphocytes two NK populations could be found in blood, namely NKp46- and NKp46+ cells that were both CD8\u03b1+ (Figure 1A, upper graph). The third NKp46-defined subset that was found in spleen (Figure 1A, lower graph) was characterised by a low to negative CD8\u03b1 expression and increased expression of the activating receptor NKp46. This applied to all animals analysed, resulting in a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for NKp46 that was 4\u20137 times higher than in the splenic NKp46+ subset (7258 \u00b1 1649 to 1362 \u00b1 397 respectively, Figure 1B, upper graph). CD8\u03b1+NKp46+ cells in blood and spleen showed comparable expression levels of the activating receptor (1462 \u00b1 437 and 1362 \u00b1 397 respectively). We then investigated differences in the expression level of CD8\u03b1 in the respective NK-cell subsets. Splenic NKp46high NK cells showed a significantly reduced level of CD8\u03b1 expression compared to the other splenic NK-cell subsets in all animals analysed (NKp46high: 495 \u00b1 219, NKp46+: 2702 \u00b1 647, NKp46-: 3098 \u00b1 818, Figure 1B, lower graph). Of note, NKp46- and NKp46+ NK cells in blood as well as spleen also showed a differential expression of CD8\u03b1, although it was not as obvious as for the NKp46high subset. Within each location NKp46- NK cells showed the highest expression of CD8\u03b1, thus indicating a correlation between an increase of NKp46 and a decrease of CD8\u03b1 expression on porcine NK-cell subsets.",

The latter is an important marker to distinguish between NK-cell subsets in mouse and human [8-10,46] and the porcine orthologue of CD27 was recently identified [37]. No marked difference in CD16 or CD27 expression between blood NKp46- and NKp46+ NK-cell subsets could be observed, although NKp46+ cells showed a slightly increased CD27 expression (Figure 1C). A clear difference between the three splenic NKp46-defined NK-cell subsets could be observed for CD16 (NKp46high: 42 588 \u00b1 12 000, NKp46+: 35 521 \u00b1 12 419, NKp46-: 31 285 \u00b1 11 267, Figure 1C) and was even more obvious for CD27 expression (NKp46high: 7978 \u00b1 2866, NKp46+: 1562 \u00b1 909, NKp46-: 1149 \u00b1 604, Figure 1C). NKp46- NK cells showed the lowest and NKp46high NK cells the highest expression of both markers, thus indicating a positive correlation between NKp46, CD16 and CD27 expression levels.",

If the same holds true for porcine NK cells, splenic NKp46highCD27high NK cells should be the most prominent cytokine producers compared to the other subsets. We therefore compared IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production between the different NK-cell populations in blood and spleen of several individuals (n = 4). Intracellular staining for IFN-\u03b3 in total PBMC and splenocytes was performed after in vitro stimulation with a combination of rhIL-2, rpIL-12 and rpIL-18 overnight. Cells cultured in medium alone served as negative control and did not show any IFN-\u03b3 production. The percentage of IFN-\u03b3+ NK cells was significantly higher in the blood NKp46+ NK-cell subset compared to blood NKp46- cells after cytokine stimulation (21.7% \u00b1 4.7 versus 9.7% \u00b1 3.1, respectively, Figure 2A and B). Nevertheless, the produced amount of IFN-\u03b3 per cell, investigated by the MFI, was similar for both blood NK-cell subsets (19 072 \u00b1 7009 for NKp46+ and 20 006 \u00b1 8634 for NKp46-, Figure 2B, right graph). Splenic NKp46high NK cells clearly showed the highest frequency of IFN-\u03b3+ cells compared to the other two splenic subsets whereas NKp46- cells had the lowest frequency (NKp46high: 11.2% \u00b1 3.6%, NKp46+: 7.2% \u00b1 3, NKp46-: 2.9% \u00b1 1.5, Figure 2A and B). Additionally, the amount of IFN-\u03b3 produced per cell was considerably higher in the NKp46high subset (NKp46high: 25 790 \u00b1 2615, NKp46+: 10 432 \u00b1 3211, NKp46-: 12 008 \u00b1 2396, Figure 2B, right graph).

Likewise after triggering of CD16, splenic NKp46high NK cells showed an increased cytolytic activity compared to the other two NK-cell subsets (18.4% \u00b1 4.6 and a MFI of 1725 \u00b1 267, Figure 5A+B). A slight increase of both read-outs after co-receptor triggering with CD16 and NKp46 could be observed for this NK-cell subset compared to the NKp46+ cells where no obvious additive effect on degranulation could be found.",

Moreover, expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 was investigated since the expression of CXCR3 in combination with CD27 can be used for the identification of NK-cell subsets with different functional properties in the mouse [10]. Therefore, FACS-sorted NKp46-defined NK-cell subsets of blood and spleen were analysed for expression of these markers by quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 6). Additionally, NKp46 mRNA levels in the different NK-cell subsets derived from blood and spleen were analysed. Results confirmed data obtained from protein expression, showing the same differential expression of NKp46 mRNA in the respective subsets (Figure 6). Interestingly, despite high NKp46 expression, for the NCR-family member NKp30 a reduced expression was found for splenic NKp46high NK cells compared to the other two splenic subsets. Blood NKp46- NK cells seemed to express slightly higher levels of NKp30 as blood NKp46+ NK cells. NKG2D mRNA levels were very homogeneous among the different NKp46-defined subsets. Also, this receptor showed the lowest variation in expression levels between different individuals. The most prominent difference in RNA expression was observed for the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Splenic NKp46high NK cells showed an overall higher expression of this receptor compared to NKp46- and NKp46+ NK-cell subsets from both spleen and blood.

We observed a negative correlation, thus an increase of NKp46 expression was accompanied by decreased expression level of CD8\u03b1.

Additionally, it was reported that cells within distinct human NK-cell subsets show different levels of NKp46 expression. Thus, higher CD56 expression [23,49,50] as well as higher CD27 expression [46,47] was associated with higher surface density of NKp46 on human NK cells. Obviously, the latter is akin to the correlation of NKp46 and CD27 we observed in the pig. More recently a phenotype of human NK cells with elevated expression of NKp46 was reported, which show an activated phenotype and seem to play a profound role in hepatitis C virus infection [23]. Likewise to our findings, in that study NKp46high NK cells showed a higher expression of CD27.

In the mouse, CD27 in combination with CD11b is used to differentiate functionally as well as developmentally different NK-cell subsets [9,51]. CD27 divides the mature CD11bhigh murine NK cells into two distinct subsets. CD27high NK cells show a higher proliferative capacity and additionally an increased cytokine production compared to the CD27low NK-cell subset [9,10]. In regard to cytotoxicity, differing reports exist. It was shown that murine CD27high NK cells show elevated cytolytic activity compared to the CD27low NK-cell subset [9]. However, another report describes the CD27low/-CXCR3- NK cells to be the more cytolytic subset in the mouse [10]. In human NK cells, high CD27 expression is also linked to higher cytokine production and the CD27low/- phenotype correlates with an overall higher cytolytic activity [8,46,47]. In contrast, the recent study on human NK cells that used NKp46 to distinguish between different NK-cell subsets showed that NKp46highCD27high NK cells have an enhanced cytokine production and cytolytic activity [23]. We likewise observed this bi-functionality in the NKp46highCD27high NK-cell subset in spleen, with an elevated IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production after in vitro stimulation but also higher cytolytic capacity after triggering of the activating receptors CD16 or NKp46 compared to the other two splenic NK-cell subsets. Consistent with this data, it was already suggested that higher density of the activating receptor NKp46 on the NK-cell surface is associated with higher cytolytic function [23,48,50]. Interestingly, we could not observe an obvious synergistic effect after co-crosslinking of both receptors in our study. Nevertheless, similar results were shown for CD16 and NKp46 co-triggering in resting human NK cells [52]. We observed an overall lower cytotoxic activity in the NKp46- subset in blood and spleen when stimulated with anti-CD16 antibody, although the expression level of CD16 was only slightly lower as in the NKp46+ NK cells. In our previous study we showed that blood NKp46- porcine NK cells had a cytotoxic capacity comparable to blood NKp46+ NK cells in killing assays using xenogeneic and allogeneic cell lines as targets [20]. The lower killing capacity we observed in this study may be caused by the triggering of only a single activation pathway, whereas the killing of target cells is likely to result from the triggering of several activating receptors and/or lack of inhibitory signals.",

Although the proportion of CD107a+ cells was not higher in the splenic NKp46high subset compared to blood NKp46+ NK cells, NKp46high NK cells showed the highest CD107a expression levels on a per cell basis. Thus, these data may suggest also a higher killing capacity on a single cell level within the splenic NKp46high NK cells. Taken the functional findings together, our data indicate that NKp46high NK cells are in a highly activated state and can readily release high amounts of cytokines or cytolytic granules upon stimulation.",

            "text": "To get further insight into the phenotype of the NKp46-defined NK-cells subsets in the pig we finally performed RT-qPCR analyses of distinct NK-cell associated markers. Expression analyses of other activating receptors, namely NKp30 and NKG2D, showed no marked differences between the NKp46-defined NK cell subsets in blood as well as in spleen. Splenic NKp46high NK cells showed slightly lower levels of the NCR-family member NKp30. NKG2D that is described as important NK-cell receptor involved in target recognition in other species [53] was very uniformly expressed between the different NK-cell subsets in the pig, which is consistent with data in mouse and human where NKG2D shows an overall similar expression pattern between different NK-cell subsets [9,47]. The most prominent difference in expression between the NKp46-defined NK-cell subsets was observed for CXCR3. Splenic NKp46high NK cells showed elevated levels of this chemokine receptor compared to the other two subsets. Likewise, mouse CD27high NK cells showed the highest levels of CXCR3 and recently a further sub-division of murine NK-cells by these two markers has been proposed [10]. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is associated with the recruitment of NK cells into the lymph node [54] and accumulation in tumors [55]. In the murine spleen, CXCR3 is important for intrasplenic trafficking of NK cells upon inflammatory signals [56] as well as the mobilisation and migration of NK cells from the spleen into the periphery [57]. Thus, one can speculate that the elevated expression of CXCR3 on porcine splenic NKp46high NK cells may indicate that this NK-cell subset is in a \u201cready-to-go\u201d state for recruitment of NK cells into the periphery or within the spleen.",
