Clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated geographic, dietary, and medication effects on the microbiome, making generalizations about age difficult. Most studies evaluate the fecal microbiome, which represents a \u201ccatch-all\u201d approach for estimation of colonic contents and may not represent location-specific microbiomes. The microbiome in close association with the mucosal surface may differ, and may be a small sub-population of the general microbiome that cannot be captured with gross fecal analysis11,12. Differences may be attributed to effects of the intestinal epithelial cells, which are constantly interacting with the microbiome. The mucosa contributes to host defense through several mechanisms, with immune competence being closely related to mucosal barrier function12,13. It is well appreciated in human and non-human primates that the elderly experience immunosenescence14\u201316, and currently there are no approved therapeutic strategies that target immunosenescence, specifically MT, or have indications for ageing, although prebiotics and probiotics are commonly used over the counter strategies.",

In the current series of studies we aimed to survey the structural and functional changes of the gut with ageing, using a relevant non-human primate model that is not confounded by medications or dietary influences17,18. We hypothesized that the GI barrier defects that we have observed in older monkeys10 may be improved with oral dosing with serum bovine immunoglobulins (SBI) which is a clinically utilized non-absorbable dietary protein product that consists of multiple immunoglobulin classes from a large pool of bovine donors. It thus captures immunoglobulin types generated from a wide range of pathogens. These immunoglobulins enable some direct binding of pathogens and their toxins, whereas the Fc region of the protein interacts with immune cells that support intestinal homeostasis to reduce inflammatory stimuli and MT19. It is believed that its predominant effect is enhancement of intestinal barrier integrity rather than endotoxin binding to reduce MT20.",

Our data suggests that adequate colonic physical barrier elements and innate immune responses to MT are present in old monkeys, and thus it may not be surprising that additional oral immunoglobulin therapy was not effective in reversing leaky gut or improving health. The microbiome profile was similar across ages, and not considered to be a major driver for loss of mucosal barrier function.

MT rates in old monkeys were significantly elevated as portal vein endotoxin levels, a direct measure of translocated Gram-negative bacterial product, had a distribution that indicated higher amounts in the blood draining the gut and travelling to the liver (Fig. 2A). Accordingly LBP-1, which is produced in the liver as a result of endotoxin exposure, was nearly five-fold higher in old monkeys (Fig. 2B; p < 0.05 for both endotoxin and LBP-1). sCD14 levels were not different between young and old monkeys in this cohort (845 vs 734 \u00b5g/mL; p = 0.73). The histostructure of the colon did not differ with age (Table 1).

Average bacterial DNA sequence depth after amplification was higher in older monkeys (34% greater), consistent with the greater bacterial loads in mucosal scrapings seen by qPCR. While none of these measures are perfect indicators of total bacterial number, together they support a hypothesis of higher loads on the aged colon mucosa. Goblet cells produce protective mucus which physically separates bacteria from the cells of the gut barrier and an inverse relationship between the bacterial abundance and goblet cells was also observed (Fig. 4D). There were no differences by age grouping in the amount of mucus detected within goblet cells of the colon (Table 1). The microbiome profiles across the 3 sampling sites were not significantly different between the young and old monkeys, which was expected based on the consistent diet and our prior evaluations from the same colony (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Tables S2\u2013S4)10. Diversity of microbiome profiles differed by sampling location, with the mucosa being significantly less diverse than the feces or colon lumen content at the phylum level (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004 respectively after post-hoc Tukey\u2019s honest significant difference test; Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, there were no statistically significant associations between the relative abundances of individual taxa and the numeric age or the age group of the monkeys at a false discover rate of 0.05.",

Six young and 6 old monkeys transitioned to a Western diet (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6) for 8 weeks, while 6 additional old monkeys stayed on the chow diet after baseline assessments to control for changes over time. At the end of the diet challenge old monkeys exhibited significantly elevated liver enzymes, plasma cholesterol, and glucose values, whereas young monkeys consuming the Western diet and old monkeys remaining on chow were unaffected (Fig. 5). Healthy old monkeys went from having normal to impaired fasting glucose values (>100 mg/dL fasting glucose). Five of the 6 old monkeys were available to re-evaluate ALT values 8 weeks after return to the healthy chow diet, and notably ALT remained significantly elevated in 3 of the 5 animals (Supplementary Fig. S2). This indicated that old monkeys are both less resilient to the nutritional stress of a diet challenge, and individuals are susceptible to persistent hepatitis. Cholesterol increased in both young and old monkeys consuming the Western diet, but more than doubled in value from baseline in the old monkeys (p < 0.001) as compared to more nominal changes in young monkeys (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5B). MT markers were measured in Western diet-fed monkeys and they did not further increase in old monkeys, while young monkeys\u2019 values did not change significantly in response to the 8-week diet challenge (Supplementary Table S7). We did not measure the microbiome, as prior diet studies have shown this intervention is not long enough to enable the detection of stable changes in fecal profiles with this number of subjects4,22.",

In doing so, we confirm that healthy ageing is not associated with large structural changes in the colon as has been discussed across models and clinical studies23, but rather with functional deficits in permeability of the GI barrier. We posit that age-related increases in GI permeability (leaky gut) may be linked to greater numbers of resident bacteria on the mucosal surface. The main functions of a competent intestinal mucosal barrier are the regulation of bacterial numbers and types residing on the surface, and clearance of pathogens detected in submucosal sites and reticuloendothelial tissues on the serosal side of the gut. Bacterial clearance mechanisms could be overwhelmed or compromised by immune deficiencies that occur with normal ageing16. MT and health is improved in antibiotic-treated or germ-free aged rodents, which supports overgrowth of bacteria on the mucosa as a mechanism for age-related barrier dysfunction3,6. We observed that high MT burden in old monkeys primes them for deterioration of metabolic and liver biomarkers in response to diet challenge and underscores the need for attention to diet quality in the aged, as it relates to frailty and health outcomes24,25. We also tested 2-week intervention of SBI, which is known to reduce endotoxemia or MT26,27, and found it does not provide benefit in aged monkeys.",

Our results show innate immune responses measured as IgA and \u03b1-defensin in circulation were higher. Although these biomarkers are not specific to gut-derived antigens, they do demonstrate upregulation in accordance with endotoxemic burden32,33. However, there are few studies that evaluate circulating levels of defensin proteins, so their value as biomarkers is not yet fully understood.

A consequence of Western diet (high calories, high fat, high simple sugars) consumption is liver damage4,5,37, and in the monkey model we have shown that both age and diet independently predict the severity of liver disease38. Thus we rationalized that advanced age plus Western dietary challenge would interact on GI barrier function to synergistically drive a worsened health outcome. A leakier gut in aged monkeys pre-existed the exaggerated responses to dietary challenge. This is consistent with the concept of \u201cinflamm-ageing\u201d and the observations that metabolic disease, and specifically subclinical hepatitis, is greater in older people35,36. When biomarkers LBP-1 and sCD14 already indicate that high MT rates exist, diet challenge did not further exacerbate this biomarker response which is consistent with recent clinical trials comparing the responses of young and old people to a short-term diet challenge39. Oral immunoglobulins have been used extensively in veterinary medicine for decades to aid in intestinal support, prevent endotoxemia and reduce inflammation, and thus we hoped that such therapy would be effective in reducing endotoxemia and inflammation seen in ageing20. SBI is clinically indicated in HIV-associated enteropathy which, like ageing, is associated with immune deficiency. However, even in HIV patients, an SBI intervention similar to that conducted here did not consistently improve GI barrier function40, with positive trials generally being limited to diarrheal disease and colitis27. The results presented herein from the monkey studies indicate that immunoglobulin responses are present in response to a leaky gut, and additional immunoglobulins do not improve barrier function. Consistent with the failure of this immunoglobulin approach is the failure of new pharmacotherapies with endotoxin binding capacity (sevelamer is an example) to reduce MT biomarkers41. Thus, we suggest that other strategies to reverse immunosenescence, such as inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin or long-term caloric restriction, which are effective enhancers of human and non-human primate T cell function, as potentially being more effective31,42.",

The presence of abundant protective mucus and the resultant selection pressure to reduce bacterial diversity are both features that prevent metabolic disease development in animal experiments12,45. The observed relationship between goblet cells, which produce mucus, and bacterial gene counts at the mucosa support this concept.",

We have now demonstrated an increase in MT in two separate cohorts of aged monkeys in this paper and in a previously published third cohort10. We are confident that the reproducibility of this age-related effect, seen in the absence of dietary challenge or disease, strengthens the subsequent observations relating to the microbiome, effects of diet and SBI interventions. We cannot generalize that aged males will be similar, but sex-effects in MT rates have not been reported. We also cannot imply causality to changes in mucosal barrier function and microbiome. Our model has the advantage of lifelong comparability of environment (including diet, geography, and social contacts) which is known to shape the majority of microbiome profiles. We see microbiome changes in this stable model only after many months of dietary intervention22, consistent with what is known about aged humans transitioning their physical and nutritional diet24. We know microbiome manipulations can alter permeability in mice3, but our data suggests that microbiome changes with healthy ageing are small and limited to shifts in abundance. Such changes could result from reduced immune surveillance, and thus increased MT follows. Our model suggests that antibiotic approaches, pre/probiotic approaches known to enhance mucus, or immune restoration are worthy of pursuing and translating to human health.",

Our SBI outcomes are clinically relevant as it is a cheap and readily available intervention being utilized in enteropathies that have an immune component. In conclusion, the ageing GI is still a relatively unknown landscape. We provide data in a primate GI system that ageing without dietary, comorbid disease, or treatment effects leads to reduced barrier function of the mucosa. The ageing GI may make old primates less resilient to challenges such as poor diet quality. The translational relevance of our study is to shape future investigations into improving barrier function, and disseminating negative findings about SBI.",

Most females are housed within their natal social group for the duration of their naturally determined lifespan21. Due to the nature of a breeding colony, aged males are not retained, so our study populations were all female. Females were classified as either young or old (>18 years), and evaluated them in a series of studies depicted in Fig. 1. Animals in the colon survey study (Study 1) were fed a commercial laboratory primate chow (Laboratory Diet 5038; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) with daily supplemental fresh fruits and vegetables. This standard laboratory diet comprised of 13% of calories from fat; 69% of calories from carbohydrates; and 18% of calories from protein (Supplementary Table S5). These animals were housed in large indoor/outdoor enclosures that provide elevated perches and climbing structures within multigenerational social groups and ad libitum opportunities to socialize, eat, and exercise. Diet consumption patterns were evaluated in a representative selection of young and old monkeys from the same colony by measurement of diet fed and diet remaining over 24 hours. Measures were available on average over 3 different days (range of 1\u201310 consumption measures/monkey). Blood and tissue samples were collected from Study 1 at a scheduled euthanasia time point, which differed from studies 2 and 3 as anaesthesia was achieved with sodium pentobarbital and blood was terminally collected from the vena cava. A separate selection of old and young monkeys from the colony were challenged with a Western Diet (Study 2; Supplementary Table S5). The Western diet comprised of 35.5% total calories supplied as fat and 14% as saturated fat. Carbohydrates were 46% of total calories with 22% supplied as simple sugars and total caloric density was. Protein content was comparable to the chow diet at 19% of calories, however the protein source was predominantly from animal sources. Dietary fibre was comparable between diets and approximates recommended human consumption levels at 35 g/day. Assessments were performed pre-diet and 8-weeks post-diet initiation. At the 8 week time point, the old monkeys continued on Western diet to evaluate the effects of SBI supplementation (Study 3). Old monkeys (n = 6) were given placebo or 6 g/day of SBI daily added to 80 g of their daily food allotment for 2 weeks in a cross-over study with 4 weeks washout between treatment periods. This dosing duration has resulted in improved MT parameters in animal studies20,26. The SBI product used was EnteraGam\u00ae (Entera Health Inc., Cary NC), which is a medical food product available by prescription for the treatment of severe inflammatory bowel disease and HIV-associated enteropathy. The dose was chosen to deliver the paediatric dose (4 g/d), while allowing for waste. The dosed food was consumed fully before additional food was offered to the monkeys. Daily observations were made and all monkeys were compliant in consuming the SBI dose. Blood samples were collected at the end of each treatment period. One animal was euthanized such that 5 monkeys were assessed with placebo and 6 monkeys were assessed with SBI treatment. The euthanasia occurred during the washout period following SBI therapy and was necessitated due to a diagnosis severe pancreatitis. Pancreatitis was confirmed by diagnostic pathology on tissues collected at necropsy.",

The DNA was likely related to the presence of more bacteria as mean sequence depth by Illumina DNA sequencing identified to bacterial taxa (B) were approximately 1.35 fold higher in old monkeys, and PCR-measured total bacterial 16S gene counts normalized to tissue weight (C) were more than doubled on average in old monkeys. The colon mucosa is protected by a mucus layer which physically separates the microbiome. Goblet cells, which produce mucus, relate to bacterial gene counts on the mucosal surface such that more goblet cells were associated with fewer bacterial genes (D; young monkeys are open circles [\u25cb] and old monkeys are closed circles [\u25cf]). The microbiome profile did not differentiate by age in monkeys consuming the same diet and exposed to the same lifelong conditions (Panel E; LI = large intestine). Results are from monkeys described in Study 1 (n = 9 young and n = 10 old monkeys).",

Old monkeys maintained on a chow diet showed no changes over time. Old monkeys are shown with black bars, young monkeys are shown in white, and the post-diet challenge value indicated for each group by checkerboard.
