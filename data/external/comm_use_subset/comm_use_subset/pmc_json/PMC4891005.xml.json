In the last decade, the continuous outbreaks of EV71 in Asia-Pacific region have caused considerable deaths [3]. More than 7 million HFMD cases were reported in China between 2008 and 2012, of which 2457 were fatal [4, 5]. No effective antiviral drug is currently used for treating EV71 infection [6]; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective agent against EV71 infection.",

As shown in Figure 1A, the RD cells without viral infection were flat with spindle-like sharps and attached well on the surface of culture dishes. When cells were infected with EV71 at a multiple of infection (MOI) of 1, many cells showed CPE. They became round, detached from the surface of culture dishes and floated away 12 hours post-infection (p.i.) (Figure 1B). When the cells were pretreated with 15 \u03bcM of OM 4 hours prior to EV71 infection, most cells were healthy with only a few exhibiting CPE (Figure 1C), an indication that the infected cells were significantly protected from CPE. Surprisingly, almost all EV71-infected cells were healthy when pretreated with 30 \u03bcM of OM (Figure 1D). Similar results were also obtained from HEK 293 cells and Hela cells (data not shown). The reduction of EV71-induced CPE by 50% (IC50) was determined byusing GraphPad Prism5. As shown in Table 1, the IC50 of OM was 2.38\u00b10.79 \u03bcM. Cell viability was employed to determine the toxicity of OM in RD cells by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assays after treating RD cells with OM for 24h. Compared with untreated cells, cell viability was not obviously affected by OM at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM. The CC50 (concentration of OM required for 50% cell kill) of the uninfected cells was 83.87\u00b11.12 \u03bcM. The selectivity of OM on RD cells was 35.24 (Table 1), indicating OM's potential to be an effective antiviral agent against EV71 infection.",

Figure 2 shows a representative pair of silver-stained 2-DE maps between two samples from three pairs of gels (Figure 2A and 2B). After comparison, 52 spots showed significant (with over 2-fold, p < 0.05) difference. The individual protein spot was extracted and digested for MALD-TOF MS and MS/MS analysis. Typical images of five paired spots were cropped and enlarged as shown in Figure 2C. We successfully identified 18 proteins with significant differential expression. Among them, eight proteins were markedly up-regulated whereas ten were down-regulated in the OM-treated RD cells as compared to the control group. The characteristics of proteins (including name, abbreviation, NCBI accession number, theoretical molecular mass, pI, peptide count, protein score (confidence interval in percent), number of unmatched masses, sequence coverage, fold change, and functions) are listed in Table 2. Functionally, they can be categorized into six categories: structural molecular activity (17%), metabolism (39%), cytoskeleton and transport proteins (11%), gene transcription associated proteins (6%), heat shock proteins and chaperones (17%), and cell proliferation, metastasis, and signal transduction proteins (11%).",

As si-ERp57-1 was more effective on knocking down ERp57, si-ERp57-1 was chosen for further experiments in our study. Consistent with the reduction of mRNA level, ERp57 protein level was also significantly decreased by si-ERp57-1 (Figure 4B). We further examined if knockdown of ERp57 would affect virus entry. RD cells were first transfected with either scrambled or si-ERp57-1 for 48 hours, and then infected with EV71 at MOI of 20 for 1 hour on ice. The infected cells were washed with PBS for three times to remove potential free viruses that had not entered the cells. We employed qRT-PCR to measure the intracellular viral RNA levels. Our data showed that the entry of EV71 had not been affected by ERp57 knockdown (Figure 4C). To further investigate if ERp57 knockdown would affect EV71 replication or reproduction, we first measured the intracellular viral RNA levels at different time points. We showed that ERp57 knockdown significantly decreased the intracellular viral RNA levels at 3 and 5 hours p.i.

After uncoating, the first and key event is viral protein translation driven by IRES [31]. Therefore, we hypothesized that OM may inhibit EV71 infection by down-regulation of IRES activity through ERp57. To test this hypothesis, we generated two constructs to express reporters Renilla luciferase (RLuc) and Firefly luciferase (FLuc). As shown in Figure 5A, two continuous stop codes (TGA TGA) were inserted between RLuc and FLuc genes in pRF plasmid; while the IRES sequence of EV71 was inserted between RLuc and FLuc genes in pIRES plasmids. In both constructs, the CMV promoter drives RLuc expression. FLuc translation is stopped when mRNA is transcribed from pRF, whereas the translation would be successful from that of pIRES. Hence, the IRES activity can be measured and expressed by the ratio of FLuc to RLuc activities.",

ERp57, a chaperon protein involved in catalyzing bisulfate bond exchange for correct protein folding in ER stress, has been shown a crucial role in the entry of DNA virus SV40 [28]. Besides virus entry, it is possible that ERp57 may exhibit other functions in the life cycle of other viruses. As an RNA virus, EV71 has a life cycle that is completely different from that of SV40. An important question is whether ERp57 exhibits a similar function in the life cycle of EV71. To address this question, we first investigated if the viral entry of EV71 would be affected by knockdown of ERp57. To our surprise, the depletion of ERp57 did not affect virus entry into the host cells (Figure 4C). Interestingly, we found that the virus replication was significantly suppressed at 3 to 5 hours p.i. after ERp57 knockdown in the host RD cells (Figure 4D). Accordingly, the secreted virions evidently decreased at 5 to 7 hours p.i. (Figure 4E). In our previous study, we have shown that EV71 undergoes the fast replication phase from 3 to 6 hours p.i. in RD cells, and carries out fast package from 6 to 9 hours p.i. (package phase) and secretion initiation [30]. Our results suggested that ERp57 involves mainly in the early phase of viral life cycle.",

We hypothesized that ERp57 may affect viral translation through regulating viral IRES activities. Our results showed that knockdown of ERp57 significantly reduced the viral IRES activities (Figure 5B). Intriguingly, OM also suppressed the IRES activity in a dose dependent manner (Figure 5C), demonstrating a correlation between drug effects and ERp57 functions. To further validate our findings, we conducted gain-of-function studies. ERp57 was ectopically expressed in host cells to test its effects on IRES activity. As expected, results from this study exhibited an increase of IRES activity by ectopic ERp57 expression (Figure 6A). This suggests that OM may affect ERp57 functions in an indirect or direct manner. We have noted that ectopic expression of ERp57 partly rescued the inhibition of early replication of EV71 (Figure 6B), indicating that in addition to ERp57, there must be other host factors contributing to the inhibitory effects of OM on EV71 reproduction. As shown in Table II, 10 proteins were down-regulated and 8 proteins were upregulated by OM. Whether these proteins contribute to the viral inhibition of OM should be investigated in future studies. Although several other compounds isolated from Garcinia oblongifolia (e.g., Oblongifolia L or P) share similar structure to OM, it antiviral effects against EV71 was much weaker (data not shown). Further investigating the underling mechanism may help us to develop OM derivatives with more potent anti-EV71 activity.",

            "text": "In summary, we showed that OM, an active compound isolated from a traditional Chinese herb, potently inhibited EV71 infection. By employing comparative proteomics studies, we identified that ERp57 was an effector of OM. Knockdown of ERp57 inhibited viral replication through downregulating viral IRES activities, whereas ectopic expression of ERp57 increased IRES activity and partly rescued the inhibition of viral replication by OM. Our results demonstrated that OM inhibited the early replication of EV71 partly through downregulating ERp57. OM could potentially be further developed into a therapeutic drug for treating EV71 infections, and ERp57 may serve as a target for developing host-based antiviral drugs against EV71 infection.",
