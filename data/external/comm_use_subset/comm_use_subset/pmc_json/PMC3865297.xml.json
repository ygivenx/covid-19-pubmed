            "text": "Membrane proteins often act as cellular receptors, transporters and various ion channels, and are involved in several crucial cellular processes, such as immune responses, nutrient uptake and nervous system signaling [1-6]. A structural understanding of these membrane proteins is beneficial to elucidating the role that each plays in the above processes [7,8]. However, there are several limitations to the study of membrane proteins structure, such as low-yield expression and localization in inclusion bodies [9,10]. To date, the high-yield expression of soluble, functional membrane proteins for structural studies has been notoriously problematic due to the scarcity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems which contain the protein processing machinery of eukaryotic secretory pathways [11,12]. Newly-developed approaches also suffer from limitations, such as cell-free protein expression, which allows for fast and efficient protein expression, yet suffers from inefficient folding and low protein activity [13,14]. Recombinant protein expression with different fusion tags has been successful in many cases, although it remains a challenge to express eukaryotic membrane proteins [1,7,9]. The human liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (hLSECtin), a type II integral membrane protein, has a well-established biological activity, but the three-dimensional structure remains unknown due to low expression yields and aggregation into inclusion bodies [15-19].",

The Tat core domain contains the sequence \u2018YGRKKRRQRRR\u2019 and it has been demonstrated that Tat peptide fusions can increase the yields and solubility of heterologous proteins [23]. Interestingly, our results here revealed that the Tat peptide was likely to promote the soluble expression of the membrane protein hLSECtin-CRD in E. coli without losing bioactivity and the protein expression level was not influenced compared with Tat-free proteins. It provided a novel method for the improvement of expression of soluble membrane proteins in prokaryotic cells by fusion with the Tat peptide, which may be potentially expanded to the expression of other membrane proteins.",

These results demonstrated that Tat-hLSECtin-CRD can specifically bind to mannose, although the binding ability is weak (Figure 4), revealing that the Tat tag not only enhanced the solubility of membrane proteins but also does not disrupt their bioactivity and biological functions.

Owing to their vital cellular functions, the study of membrane proteins has become the subject of intense research recently, especially the study of protein structure. Unfortunately, there is little structural information available for most membrane proteins due to the difficulties in obtaining sufficient bioactive protein [36]. Attempts at high-yield and soluble expression of membrane proteins have become a bottleneck in efforts to undertake structural or functional analyses [7,9]. Traditionally, eukaryotic membrane proteins were expressed in eukaryotic systems by recombinant techniques but with much lower yields [10]. The high-yield expression of these constructs could be achieved in prokaryotic systems but only for some prokaryotic proteins, since eukaryotic membrane proteins aggregated into inclusion bodies due to the lack of appropriate posttranslational modification mechanisms [11,12]. During the last decade, the advent of novel strategies to express membrane proteins has resulted in significant advancements such as baculovirus expression vector systems, cell-free expression systems, insect cells and mammalian cells expression systems etc [37,38]. However, no single method was suitable for all proteins. Previously, Wu et al. have shown that the HIV-1-encoded Tat peptide could increase the yields and the solubility of heterologous protein in prokaryotic expression systems [23]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the Tat peptide could also increase the yields and the solubility of the membrane protein hLSECtin-CRD.",

The biological activity of hLSECtin has been well documented, but little structural information exists due to the lack of abundant soluble protein for crystallization [41-44]. The gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3 and expressed in human peripheral blood and thymic dendritic cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and liver Kupffer cells [18,45]. As an endocytic receptor, an attachment factor and a glycan-binding receptor, hLSECtin could bind to various carbohydrates in a Ca2+-dependent manner via its CRD domain, including mannose, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) [46-48].In this study, we demonstrated that the Tat-hLSECtin-CRD protein has a distinct mannose-binding activity, suggesting that the Tat tag does not disrupt the bioactivity of heterologous proteins. Although our data effectively demonstrated that the Tat tag could promote the soluble expression of the membrane protein hLSECtin-CRD in E. coli, the mechanism is still unknown. The potential mechanism will be investigated in our future work that will focus on the regulation of gene expression and translation.",
