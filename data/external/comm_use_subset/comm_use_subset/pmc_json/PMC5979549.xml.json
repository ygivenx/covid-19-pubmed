IAV infection can increase the expressions of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, MyD88, IRAK4 and TRAF6, the phosphorylations of Akt, MAPK, and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 [4,5,6,7,8]. In severe IAV-infected or died patients, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, and MyD88 are lastingly and highly expressed [9,10]. It has been reported that lasting activation of TLR3 is detrimental to IAV-induced acute pneumonia, conversely, IAV-infected TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice have an unexpected survival advantage with significantly lower viral titer, less inflammatory mediators, and fewer pathological changes in lung [11,12]. TLR4 is reported to markedly cluster at the site of IAV-cell interaction on cytomembrane and determines IAV entry and tissue tropism through MyD88 expression and p38 MAPK activation [13]. Inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus can induce severe oxidative stress and rapidly leads to ALI through TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6-NF-\u03baB signaling [14]. TLR4\u2212/\u2212 mice are reported to be highly refractory to IAV-induced ALI, and TLR4 antagonist eritoran can decrease viral titer and IAV-induced lethality [15]. Activation of TLR7 is also necessary for efficient replication of IAV [16]. Several inhibitors of TLR7/8-MyD88 signaling can effectively suppress IAV replication and IAV-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) [7]. Moreover, activation of TLRs-MyD88 signals are also essential for MMP-9 release and neutrophil excessive migration, both of which are two principal causes for ALI/ARDS [17]. In addition, PI3K/Akt and the downstream cascades of TLRs, such as MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways, are also required for IAV infection and proliferation [13,18,19,20,21].",

Using these plasmids, we have performed several times of drug screening assays, and found that sophora root (Sophora flavescens Aiton), a traditional herbal medicine which has been used as an antipyretic, diuretic, and anthelmintic agent in China for thousands of years, can significantly inhibit the TLRs-MyD88-NF-\u03baB pathway. Oxymatrine (C15H24N2O2, OMT) is a major active compound of sophora root [22]. It has been reported that OMT has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammation, anti-virus, hepatoprotective, and immunosuppression activities, and currently is extensively employed to treat viral hepatitis, traumatic brain injury, acute pancreatitis, sepsis, and ALI in the clinic [23,24,25]. In the previous study, we have found that OMT, at a low concentration, only inhibits IAV infection in vitro, but cannot in vivo. In the present study, we again determined the effect of OMT on IAV infection at a high concentration in vitro and in vivo, and investigated the mechanism of action of OMT, mainly focusing on the TLRs, PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.",

The inhibition of OMT on IAV replication only occurred during 1\u20135 h post infection (p.i.) (Figure S2).",

In addition, it has also been reported that OMT can inhibit the activations of TLRs-MyD88-MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathways in brain damage [28], in CCl4-induced cirrhotic rats [29], and in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells [30]; therefore, we also determined the effect of OMT in IAV-infected cells on these signal pathways. As showed in Figure 4A,B, OMT could significantly inhibit IAV-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65, but not significantly on IAV-induced phosphorylation of JNK, investigated by a western blotting assay. In addition, to detect the influence of OMT on the transcriptions of NF-\u03baB downstream target genes, we have purchased a pNF-\u03baB-luc reporter plasmid which has 4 duplicated NF-\u03baB response elements (GGGAATTTCC) (D2206, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).

In 2009 H1N1 \u2018swine flu\u2019 outbreak, Chinese government had released a document entitled \u201cRecommended Schemes for Pandemic Influenza A Diagnoses and Treatments\u201d, which recommended four anti-flu TCM prescriptions [31]. In 2011 and 2018, Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission had also released a related document for the diagnoses and treatments of \u2018flu\u2019, respectively; both of which separately recommended five TCM prescriptions [32,33]. In the past decade, we have always been devoted to the research of anti-IAV drug screening from TCMs. Recently, we have constructed a series of luciferase reporter plasmids based on the gene promoters of the TLRs-MyD88/TRIF-TRAF6 signal pathway, and have screened out several TCMs with excellent anti-IAV activity, and sophora root is one of them. After investigating some previous researches and related literature, we find that sophora root and its major active compound OMT have been used for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis in the clinic for many years [34]. Moreover, during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2001, Chinese bureau of science and technology has announced that the composite sophora japonica injection (mainly containing OMT) has distinct effects in the treatment of SARS, which has displayed the magical power of OMT to treat systemic inflammatory responses [23]. So we speculate that if OMT can inhibit IAV infection, it may be directly utilized to fight IAV in the clinic. As we initially expect, OMT really can inhibit the replications of IAV, including ST169 (H1N1), PR8 (H1N1), ST1233 (H1N1), HKG1 (H9N2), GDA1 (H9N2), GD105 (H5N1), ST602 (H3N2), and ST364 (H3N2), in vitro and in vivo. Among them, ST169, PR8, ST1233, ST602, and ST364 belong to human IAV, while HKG1, GDA1, and GD105 belong to avian influenza virus.",

In the present study, we find that OMT can significantly decrease the expressions of TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, MyD88, and TRAF6 genes after IAV infection, and we preliminarily speculate that OMT may inhibit IAV proliferation and IAV viral pneumonia via inhibiting TLRs signaling pathways.",

It has been reported that activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway supports IAV infection [26], and inhibition of Akt will suppress IAV entry and IAV RNP nuclear export [18]. Pleschka S. et al. have showed that activation of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is a prerequisite for IAV replication, and blockade of ERK pathway can retard RNP export and reduces virus titers [19]. Marjuki H. et al. have showed that IAV-induced activations of ERK and PI3K are required for the fusion of IAV viral particles with the target cells mediated by V-ATPase-dependent intracellular pH change [35]. Guo B. et al. have showed that p38 MAPK is a key determinant of virus entry and tissue tropism [13]. Activation of NF-\u03baB signaling is also a prerequisite for IAV infection, NF-\u03baB inhibitors can specifically diminish IAV vRNA transcription from its cRNA promoter and reduce vRNA synthesis [21]. Our results have shown that OMT can significantly decrease IAV-induced activations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB pathways, which may imply that these signal pathways may also be implicated in the anti-IAV activity of OMT.",

So we think that OMT-inhibition on IAV replication may be through inhibiting TLR4, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.
