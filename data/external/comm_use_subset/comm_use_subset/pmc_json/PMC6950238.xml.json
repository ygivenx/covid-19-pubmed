            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. They are classified into four genera (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and deltacoronavirus) and infect both mammalian and avian hosts [1,2]. Equine coronavirus (ECoV) belongs to Betacoronavirus 1 species, within the Embecovirus subgenus of the Betacoronavirus genus, as does human coronavirus OC43, HKU1 and bovine coronavirus [3]. ECoV was isolated for the first time from a two-week-old diarrheic foal in North Carolina (USA) in 1999, suggesting the role of ECoV in causing enteric disease [4]. Since 2010, several cases of ECoV infections have also been reported in adult horses from the United States, Europe and Japan [5,6,7,8,9]. Equine coronavirus has been detected in fecal samples from horses with clinical signs that included anorexia, lethargy, fever and, less frequently, diarrhea, colic and neurologic deficits [10,11]. The morbidity rate varies from 10% to 83% during outbreaks. Mortality is low and has been related to endotoxemia, septicemia or hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy [12,13]. The outbreaks in adult horses demand further studies on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of ECoV infections. For this, diagnostic assays with high sensitivity and specificity are crucial.",

            "text": "ECoV is known to be associated with enteric infections but can also be detected in a small percentage of horses with respiratory signs. Virus shedding can be observed in fecal samples or nasal swabs from sick horses as well as healthy horses, but with a strong association between clinical signs assumed to be related to ECoV infection and virus detection in fecal samples suggesting a possible etiological role of ECoV [10,14]. Recently, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods have been established and were shown to be able to detect ECoV in feces efficiently. However, ECoV viral nucleic acid is generally only detectable by qPCR within a limited timeframe of 3\u20139 days post infection, as reported from both field and experimental studies [6,7,12,15]. On the other hand, serological assays can be used to support the diagnosis of a clinical ECoV infection by showing seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer in paired serum samples. Serological assays are also needed to gain more insight into the transmission rate of infection within animal populations [16]. Antibodies induced by betacoronaviruses persist in blood for a longer period after infection [17,18]. The virus neutralization (VN) assay has long been used as a gold standard to confirm serological responses to coronavirus infections [19,20,21]. Although the VN assay is highly specific for the detection of antibodies, it is also time-consuming and laborious to perform. Alternative high-throughput serologic assays that correlate well with neutralizing antibodies are therefore needed. Severe infections of ECoV have been shown to be associated with high viral load, but mild or asymptomatic infections may occur with low levels of virus replication being negative in PCR and with variable immune responses [12]. Consequently, specific, sensitive and high-throughput serodiagnostic methods are necessary to avoid the underestimation of prevalence in surveillance studies.",

The N-terminal S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding, while the C-terminal S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion [22,23]. The S1 subunit is the most variable immunogenic antigen among coronaviruses, and therefore it is an ideal candidate for the detection of CoV species-specific antibodies [24,25].

The horses presented similar clinical signs as described in [27], and virus shedding was confirmed by qPCR analysis [7]. At the acute stage, 11 out of 27 horses were qPCR positive, while at the convalescent stage, this number had decreased to six. Serum samples were further validated by VN assay (Figure 3B; Table S1). Seven out of 27 horses showed seroconversion, while another 14 horses showed a significant (4-fold or greater) increase in VNT. Performing the wELISA (see Figure 3A; Table S1), the same seven out of 27 horses showed seroconversion; acute phase sera were negative (OD value < 0.35) whereas the convalescent phase sera all had OD values greater than 1.00 (1.14\u20132.90). Thus, seroconversion rates calculated from wELISA and VNT showed a 100% correlation (Table S1). For the horses that showed a 4-fold or greater increase in VNT (n = 14), nine of the acute phase sera had positive OD values between 0.35 and 0.70 (2x background) and also a higher than 2 (n = 2) to 4 (n = 7) fold increase in the OD value in the convalescent serum. Five of the VNT positive paired serum samples had OD values of >0.70 (twice the background OD value) in the acute phase serum. Two of these samples with an OD value of 1.12 and 1.41 respectively in wELISA also showed a greater than 2-fold increase in OD value. The three VNT positive samples with less than 2-fold increase in OD values already had high OD values in the acute phase serum as well as high VNT (mean OD value = 2.51, mean VNT = 8.30). For the six horses that did not show a significant rise in VNT, five serum samples collected at the acute stage already had high antibody levels as shown by ELISA and neutralization assay (mean OD value > 2.6, mean VNT > 9, Table S1). Further, the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the overall correlation between the OD values obtained with wELISA and VNT (log2 titers) from acute and convalescent-phase sera of the 27 horses (Figure S1). Results indicate that OD values and VNT show a good degree of correlation (R2 = 0.83, p < 0.0001). These data support the use of the wELISA as a diagnostic tool in case of suspected ECoV outbreaks.",

In our study, we set up an ECoV S1-based ELISA method in two complementary formats. The conventional wELISA format is for general laboratory usage with simplified, easy to perform coating procedures. On the other hand, coated plates of the dELISA format could be stored for a longer time period, making it ideal for transportation and kit development. We showed that both formats performed equally well, and their results correlated nicely. When comparing with the VN assay by ROC analysis, our ELISA method with both formats was shown to have high accuracy. In our current study we applied wELISA for the analysis of the paired outbreak samples, while the dELISA was further validated and used for the high-throughput screening of larger amount of serum samples.",

The S1 chimeric protein was expressed in mammalian cells, and hence both the protein conformation and modification (e.g., glycosylation) are mimicking the S proteins on the surface of virus particles [29]. As the most divergent and immunodominant component of coronaviruses, S1 has been widely used in the development of methods for specific coronavirus serological studies [19,20,26,30]. Our findings validate that ECoV S1 is a highly suitable antigen for the detection of antibodies against ECoV showing very good agreement between the ELISA and VN assays. Recently, similar conclusions were also drawn for the role of MERS S1 in MERS serology [31].",

In the virus neutralization assay seroconversion or a 4-fold or greater increase in ECoV antibody titers could be detected in sera of 21 out of 27 horses within weeks of the initial observation of clinical disease and detection of viral RNA in feces. Of these 21 positive horses 18 showed seroconversion or a 2-fold or higher increase in OD values in the wELISA. The three remaining VNT positive samples had high OD values already in the acute phase serum. Of the six ECoV negative paired samples five had high VN antibody titers and OD values already at the acute phase. This might be due to late sampling of these horses or previous exposure to ECoV (Table S1). This study confirms that the ECoV S1 ELISA is a useful diagnostic test for the demonstration of a potential ECoV outbreak and should be considered as a useful adjunct to investigation of fecal samples by qPCR.",

Results showed that the overall seroprevalence in the different cohorts tested is 25.9%\u201382.8%. These percentages are in agreement with the study performed by Hemida et al. [32], in which they detected coronavirus infections in horses in Saudi Arabia and Oman and they found that 74% of them had detectable neutralizing antibodies to ECoV. A lower percentage (9.6%) of positive animals was found in another ECoV seroprevalence study conducted in the USA [33]. Several factors might contribute to these differences in results. There is only limited information regarding ECoV prevalence in Europe including the Netherlands [6,28], and it is possible that the overall ECoV distribution differs between continents. Moreover, our study employs eukaryotically expressed ECoV S1 protein as coating antigens, while in the US study chimeric S2 protein expressed in Escherichia coli was used. The expression in mammalian cells guarantees a more native configuration of the protein, in particular of glycosylated antigens such as the coronavirus spike protein. Reports had shown that both coronavirus S1 and S2 subunit elicit antibody responses, but the level of immune responses triggered by them may differ [34,35]. Furthermore, the criteria for determining the cut-off value are different for the two studies. In our study we defined positive and negative samples on the basis of a VN assay, whereas the US study used negative qRT-PCR and absence of clinical signs as criteria to define horses as ECoV negative. In this way, seropositive horses may have contributed to higher cut-off values and potentially a lower sensitivity of the assay.",

The risk of becoming infected increases with age. This hypothesis is further supported by the age distribution of PCR-confirmed ECoV infection cases: foals (age 0\u20136 months) have the lowest infection rates, and the infection rate increases with age [10].",

Intriguingly, we noticed that Icelandic horses also are seropositive against ECoV (panel H, Table 1). Twenty-four serum samples showed high ECoV ELISA reactivity (S/P value > 0.5) and also had neutralizing antibodies with VNT varying between 32 and 768. The horse population of Iceland has been geographically isolated for more than 1000 years and is free from most common equine contagious diseases such as equine influenza, equine herpesvirus 1, strangles and equine viral arteritis [40].
