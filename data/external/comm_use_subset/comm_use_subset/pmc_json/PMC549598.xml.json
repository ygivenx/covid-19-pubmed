Traditionally, scientists have used travel- and contact-tracing methods, but the recent SARS epidemic showed that sequence-based techniques for pathogen detection can also be important tools to help understand outbreaks. Jianjun Liu and colleagues adapted mass spectrometry (MS)\u2013based genotyping, already used as a high-throughput way of detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA, to the analysis of the SARS virus from clinical samples.",

Liu's colleagues at the Genome Institute of Singapore had previously shown that common genetic variants in the SARS-CoV genome could be used as molecular fingerprints to help trace the route of infection. However, as \u201csequence analysis of large numbers of clinical samples is challenging, cumbersome, and expensive,\u201d they felt that \u201cwhat is needed is a rapid, sensitive, high throughput, and cost-effective screening method.\u201d Towards this goal, Liu and colleagues now demonstrate that an MS-based technique can quickly yield accurate information on clinical isolates (in this case from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore).\n",

They analyzed isolates taken from 13 patients with SARS at different stages of the Singapore outbreak, identified nine sequence variations, and discovered a new primary route of introduction of the virus into the Singapore population. They also found a Singaporean origin for a German case of SARS, a result that could not be derived from standard sequencing methods. The analysis of the uncultured lung tissue also found different sequences in a single patient, which suggested the presence of multiple viral sequence variants in one host.",
