            "text": "The field of landscape genetics seeks to identify relationships between heterogeneous landscape features and genetic variation in free\u2010living organisms and has become a popular method for investigating drivers of processes such as gene flow, genetic drift and selection. (Manel & Holderegger, 2013; Manel, Schwartz, Luikart, & Taberlet, 2003). Landscape genetics has grown substantially since its formal inception in 2003, facilitated by technological advances that have increased the availability of molecular and landscape data in conjunction with more powerful computational and analytical approaches. Landscape genetics is fuelled by a steady stream of new ideas and methodologies, which, while exciting, can contribute to a lack of consensus or consistency in some key aspects. These aspects include the formulation of research questions, sampling strategies, analytical methods (Balkenhol, Waits, & Dezzani, 2009; Richardson, Brady, Wang, & Spear, 2016; Wagner & Fortin, 2013) and even the identity of the field itself (Dyer, 2015; Storfer et al., 2007). In fact, landscape genetics has yet to develop its own comprehensive, unifying theory for linking spatial and temporal landscape heterogeneity to genetic variation (Balkenhol, Cushman, Waits, & Storfer, 2016). While these issues are expected to be remedied as the field matures, many suggestions have been made to facilitate this progress. These have included calls for an increase in cross\u2010disciplinary collaboration (Balkenhol, Gugerli et al., 2009) and an expansion of the scope of landscape genetic research beyond its current emphasis on vertebrates (Balkenhol, Cushman, Waits et al., 2016; Dyer, 2015) and, particularly, mammals (Kozakiewicz, Carver, & Burridge, 2018).",

            "text": "One logical avenue for cross\u2010disciplinary expansion of landscape genetics is in disease ecology (Biek & Real, 2010). Elucidating the specific influences of landscape features on pathogen transmission can provide key insights into the processes that affect disease risk and incidence. However, accomplishing this has been a challenge for disease ecologists (Ostfeld, Glass, & Keesing, 2005). Indeed, the field of spatial epidemiology has only recently begun to emphasize the use of explicit landscape approaches in studies of spatial heterogeneity in infectious disease (i.e., \u201clandscape epidemiology\u201d; Ostfeld et al., 2005; Meentemeyer, Haas, & V\u00e1clav\u00edk, 2012). A major challenge for the study of landscape epidemiology, a field which does not traditionally implement genetic approaches, is that it is typically dependent on the ability to identify the location and timing of transmission events such that they can be compared to landscape features of interest. Transmission events are essentially impossible to observe, so disease ecologists often assume that contacts between infected and susceptible individuals are a reasonable proxy for transmission. Such contacts generally must be inferred indirectly using methods such as proximity collars, mark\u2010recapture or telemetry, often using spatial overlap as a proxy for contact (Craft & Caillaud, 2011). These methods are logistically challenging to employ, and whether an inferred contact resulted in transmission is uncertain (Craft, 2015). Further, much landscape epidemiological research uses infection or exposure data to indicate past transmission, but these methods provide static snapshots of pathogen prevalence and may be inappropriate for inferring how transmission or spread has occurred (or is occurring) over time (Meentemeyer et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The spatial distribution and movement of hosts are major factors affecting the likelihood, timing and spatial patterns of pathogen transmission and spread (Dougherty, Seidel, Carlson, Spiegel, & Getz, 2018). Landscape genetics can identify landscape factors that are important drivers of host population structure. These landscape factors can determine the spatial configuration of a population, its density, its connectivity with other populations, its demographic structure and its genetic health\u2014all of which have implications for the dynamics of microorganisms infecting the host species (Ellis, V\u00e1clav\u00edk, & Meentemeyer, 2010; Prentice, Marion, White, Davidson, & Hutchings, 2014; Spielman, Brook, Briscoe, & Frankham, 2004). Further, pathogen dynamics can be inferred directly using pathogen genetic data (Archie, Luikart, & Ezenwa, 2009; DeCandia, Dobson, & vonHoldt, 2018) and incorporated into landscape genetic analyses. Understanding specifically how infectious agents respond to the influence of landscape factors on hosts enables us to predict how such agents might spread based on present landscape configurations, as well as under potential future landscape scenarios (Real & Biek, 2007). This knowledge can subsequently inform management efforts at the population level (such as vaccination targeted at key regions, culling), as well as broader decisions relating to the management of the landscape itself, which is a key aim of landscape genetics generally (Manel & Holderegger, 2013; Segelbacher et al., 2010). Landscape genetics is being applied by managers at relatively low rates compared to related ecological fields such as landscape ecology, conservation biology and telemetry research (Bowman et al., 2016). Therefore, studies that contribute to the management of disease agents within populations could increase the practical impacts of landscape genetics significantly. However, the conceptual underpinnings of pathogen landscape genetics are not fully developed, and the methodologies employed are diverse and potentially confusing for new practitioners.",

(2005), offering an approach to overcome many feasibility issues associated with understanding landscape influences on pathogen transmission. The landscape genetic approach to studying disease was later reviewed by Biek and Real (2010), who were optimistic about its growth and future use. In particular, they noted that microparasites, such as viruses, are well\u2010suited to landscape genetic study due to their rapid mutation rate and potential spatial genetic structure that can be compared to heterogeneous landscape features at fine temporal and spatial scales. Analyses could be conducted using both pathogenic organisms and agents that do not cause significant diseases in their hosts (Biek, Drummond, & Poss, 2006). They also identified that methodologies such as GIS, which are commonly employed both in the wider landscape genetics literature and in spatial studies of infectious disease, had not been widely implemented in molecular epidemiology (Archie et al., 2009). Further, other popular landscape genetic tools, such as those focused on differential landscape permeability (e.g., least\u2010cost paths), were greatly underused despite compatibility with pathogen spatial genetic data.",

The rate of publication has remained relatively steady (and arguably low) since then, with none of the subsequent 7 years recording more publications than in 2009, when six papers were published.

This is likely because DNA is easier to obtain from larger, free\u2010living hosts than for pathogens, and methods for genotyping and characterizing host spatial genetic variation are more familiar to landscape geneticists, who predominantly study free\u2010living organisms (Storfer, Murphy, Spear, Holderegger, & Waits, 2010). Among pathogens that are associated with a particular animal vector, the vector is often genotyped (9 of 14 studies of vector\u2010borne diseases), as vectors such as ticks or mosquitos are also easily sampled, and vector gene flow can be used as a proxy for pathogen spread. Vectors can be targeted for population control as a means of limiting pathogen spread, which makes their study of immediate relevance to wildlife and livestock managers (Townson et al., 2005). Pathogen genetic data are used in only 16 of 51 pathogen landscape genetic studies, which was somewhat surprising considering that the pathogen is the primary motivation behind many of the reviewed studies. One study included both host and pathogen genetic data (Talbot, Vonhof, Broders, Fenton, & Keyghobadi, 2017).",

In general, viruses evolve more rapidly than other microparasites, which makes them well\u2010suited to study of genetic variation for inference of transmission history (Archie et al., 2009; Grenfell et al., 2004). However, a majority of landscape genetic studies involving viruses used host genetic data, potentially reflecting the relative difficulty of obtaining viral data, which we discuss later in this section. Instead, the high representation of viruses is largely due to the considerable effort devoted to studying rabies, which comprised half of all landscape genetic studies on viral systems. Rabies is one of the most well\u2010known wildlife pathogens globally, due to its negative impacts on wildlife, domestic animal and human health (Gordon et al., 2004). Large outbreaks have occurred in North American and European wildlife in recent years, where considerable resources have been devoted to its management (Holmala & Kauhala, 2006; Slate et al., 2009). Animals infected with rabies also often exhibit behavioural changes that may make them easier to identify (Lef\u00e8vre et al., 2009), potentially aiding sampling of infected individuals.",

This approach represents a direct application of the conventional landscape genetic paradigm to the study of disease transmission, where a typical animal landscape genetic study is interpreted in the context of the pathogenic organism. This can provide useful indications of the potential for individuals carrying pathogens to disperse across particular landscape features, which can be used to inform management efforts. For example, DeYoung et al. (2009) identified long\u2010distance gene flow among grey fox populations in Texas that was unrelated to landscape features tested, determining that current rabies oral vaccination plans should be expanded given the high potential for long\u2010distance host movement. In another rabies study, landscape genetics was used to characterize striped skunk dispersal across riverine and highway barriers to assess their utility as barriers to pathogen spread (Talbot, Garant, Paquette, Mainguy, & Pelletier, 2012).",

            "text": "Using host or vector genetic data to predict pathogen spread is attractive as it avoids sampling of the agent itself, which may be substantially more difficult, especially in wildlife populations. Identification of infected hosts often requires laboratory testing and may require specific, potentially invasive sampling approaches (e.g., necropsy) for accurate diagnosis. In addition, extensive sampling may be required to obtain adequate sample sizes when prevalence is low and must be conducted strategically to capture spatial heterogeneity. Direct study of pathogens may not be possible when predicting the risk of spread in as\u2010yet uninfected populations, or where identification of infected individuals is unreliable. However, a direct association of host or vector gene flow with spread of the microparasite should not be assumed given the potential influence of other factors such as other host and/or vector species, environmental persistence, pathogen reproductive mode or simply transmission via movement of nonreproducing hosts (Maz\u00e9\u2010Guilmo, Blanchet, Mccoy, & Loot, 2016; Tesson et al., 2016). For example, Lee et al. (2012) showed disassociation between host and virus genetic structure owing to host movement events that did not result in host gene flow (reproduction), but did result in transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats. Indeed, correlation between host dispersal and parasite genetic structure is often weak (Maz\u00e9\u2010Guilmo et al., 2016). Therefore, studies using host or vector data alone have limitations for inferring or predicting pathogen spread, or lack thereof, directly. However, host landscape genetic studies can provide indications of the potential risk of spread of infectious agents, and the understanding gained about host movements can inform subsequent studies of pathogen dynamics.",

More commonly, host neutral genetic variation is used to explain spatial patterns of infection risk or prevalence. A prominent example is a study of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white\u2010tailed deer. Blanchong et al. (2008) found that populations with lower CWD prevalence showed higher genetic differentiation from those that had high CWD prevalence. This genetic differentiation was found to be associated with roads and rivers, which were likely barriers to both host gene flow and CWD spread.

This can create strong selection that acts on various genes, and geographic variation in selection at loci that are known to be associated with adaptive immune genes may reflect variation in pathogen pressure, and individual infection or disease risk (Fumagalli et al., 2011).

Genetic material may be absent from, or uninformative in some infectious agents, such as prions or clonally transmissible cancers, necessitating genetic analysis of the host (Kelly et al., 2014; Storfer et al., 2017). In addition to the aforementioned difficulties with pathogen diagnosis, pathogen nucleic acid can be difficult to isolate from samples taken from the host or vector and would ideally be present in the blood, saliva or other easily collected sample. Samples may also require enrichment to obtain sufficient quantities of genetic material for analysis, which can be difficult to accomplish for many pathogens, particularly viruses. However, genetic information from viruses may be particularly useful for molecular epidemiologic analyses due to their rapid mutation rate that can closely infer transmission history (Archie et al., 2009; Brunker, Hampson, Horton, & Biek, 2012). Further, viruses are prominent emerging pathogens and have relatively small genomes, aiding whole genome\u2010analysis. Landscape effects on viral transmission are typically studied using phylogenetic approaches (Fountain\u2010Jones, Craft et al., 2017; Joannon, Lavigne, Lecoq, & Desbiez, 2010; Streicker et al., 2016; Young et al., 2017).

Highly pathogenic agents (i.e., those that cause a greater severity of disease) are typically of utmost interest due to their potential implications for wildlife conservation, agricultural production and human health. Among the studies identified in our literature search, agents that form chronic infections and have moderate or high pathogenic effects on their sampled host/vector organisms were more frequently investigated (see Supporting Information Appendix S1). However, genetically inferring transmission histories of pathogens in host populations experiencing high rates of mortality may be problematic because hosts through which the pathogen has spread may no longer be present in the population and are unable to be sampled. Similarly, acutely infectious agents from which the host recovers after a short period of time may also evade sampling. These characteristics may be less problematic for agricultural populations where morbidity or mortality can be identified and samples collected immediately, but inevitably leave \u201cbreaks\u201d in the inferred chain of transmission among wild populations. While complete sampling of wild populations is rarely possible in any case, obtaining adequate sample sizes is easier for apathogenic or low\u2010pathogenicity agents that form chronic infections and may be sampled at any time postinfection (e.g., feline immunodeficiency virus; Biek et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2012; Fountain\u2010Jones, Craft et al., 2017).

Frequently, epidemiological simulations are used to predict the spread of pathogens and their effect on host populations (Calonnec, Cartolaro, Naulin, Bailey, & Langlais, 2008). However, the use of landscape genetic simulations in pathogen studies has been relatively limited. Landscape genetic simulations have been used to predict raccoon rabies transmission risk across a river barrier by simulating various rates of host dispersal and comparing these outputs with empirical genetic data from the host (Rees et al., 2008). The spread of particular host genes relevant to disease can also be simulated to inform management efforts. For instance, Landguth, Holden, Mahalovich, and Cushman (2017) used landscape genetic simulations to determine optimal planting regimes to maximize the spread of blister rust resistant genes among whitebark pine populations. Such simulations could undoubtedly be applied to vector species in particular, such as predicting the spread of pesticide resistance genes in mosquitos (Chang et al., 2016) and selecting appropriate sites for introduction of genetically modified vectors (Lavery, Harrington, & Scott, 2008). In addition, with the need to develop further landscape genetic frameworks for the study of pathogens, simulation modelling can prove useful in testing and validating these techniques, as it has done in the broader landscape genetics field (Cushman et al., 2013; Zeller et al., 2016). For example, Leo, Gonzalez, Millien, and Cristescu (2016) used landscape genetic simulations to validate their multitaxa integrated landscape genetic framework, which appears to be a promising solution to the challenge of studying pathogens with multiple hosts and/or vectors.

These techniques produce measures of landscape or \u201ceffective\u201d distance among populations or individuals for each hypothesis, which can be tested against observed genetic variation. The primary applications of resistance surface modelling in landscape genetics have been the identification of dispersal corridors and predicting the impacts of landscape and environmental change, such as habitat fragmentation or climate change, on connectivity. Similar to that, landscape genetic resistance surfaces can identify transmission corridors or future patterns of spread (e.g., Streicker et al., 2016), and such tools have been identified previously as having great utility for pathogen landscape genetic studies (Biek & Real, 2010). However, resistance surface modelling remains infrequently applied among pathogen studies. Careful consideration is required for identifying the most relevant landscape variables to be tested and correctly parameterizing (assigning costs to) the resistance surface(s) so that these variables are represented in a biologically meaningful way. Developing landscape resistance hypotheses for transmitted agents may be more difficult as their interactions with the landscape are often indirect, mediated by the ecology of hosts and vectors. Pathogen ecological niche models offer an empirical approach for constructing resistance surfaces based on ecological factors influencing pathogen prevalence (Escobar et al., 2017; Fountain\u2010Jones, Pearse et al., 2017), but these also may not adequately represent host/vector movements.",

            "text": "The application of microparasite molecular markers to the study of host movements should be considered with some caveats in mind. As we have discussed previously, host movements and parasite transmission are not necessarily coupled (Maz\u00e9\u2010Guilmo et al., 2016), and assumptions about how closely parasite gene flow may reflect host movements must be made with care. Also, rapid mutation and rapid dissemination of new alleles (i.e., infectious agent transmission can generally occur much more quickly than host reproduction) largely limit the use of genetic data from the microparasite to the study of very recent or ongoing landscape changes, while older processes are better studied using host genetic data. However, choice of infectious agent based on its characteristics (e.g., mutation rate, prevalence in a population, mode of transmission) may be tailored to the type and age of the host process under study. We thus do not propose that microparasite genetic data alone should be used to study host movements in their entirety, but rather that it may have specific utility as a complementary approach to host markers for providing a more complete analysis of host movement. Such insights might include contacts between specific hosts, potentially including interspecific interactions. As new infectious agents are discovered and their relationships with host movements become better understood, microparasite molecular markers will have increasing utility in landscape genetic research of host populations.",

The majority of such work has been conducted on RNA viruses owing to their small, rapidly mutating genomes, requiring relatively little sequencing effort to detect contemporary phylogenetic signals. Other pathogens that evolve more slowly, such as bacteria or fungal pathogens, require the sequencing of larger portions of their genomes to capture equivalent phylogenetic signals (Biek, Pybus, Lloyd\u2010Smith, & Didelot, 2015). While this is becoming increasingly feasible (Kao, Haydon, Lycett, & Murcia, 2014), more complex computational analysis is required to make meaningful conclusions.",

            "text": "Several approaches may be used for relating phylogenetic information with landscape variables. Neighbour joining trees can identify clusters for quantifying population\u2010level landscape genetic relationships (Joannon et al., 2010). The calculation of genetic distances based on maximum likelihood trees (Carrel, Emch, Tung, Jobe, & Wan, 2012; Real et al., 2005; Young et al., 2017) results in distance matrices that can be correlated with landscape resistance matrices using conventional landscape genetic approaches. Relaxed random walk phylogeographic approaches (Lemey, Rambaut, Welch, & Suchard, 2010) that can reconstruct pathogen dispersal have been linked to landscape predictors using a \u201cphylogeographic GLM\u201d method (Faria, Suchard, Rambaut, Streicker, & Lemey, 2013; Jacquot, Nomikou, Palmarini, Mertens, & Biek, 2017). The phylogeographic GLM approach has enabled a better understanding of how landscape and hosts can constrain pathogen spread. For example, using the phylogeographic GLM approach on viral genomic data, roads and rivers, coupled with dog distribution, were found to impact rabies spread in Tanzania (Brunker et al., 2018). However, this approach is limited to discrete sampling locations and is computationally intensive (Dellicour, Rose, & Pybus, 2016). A recent framework by Dellicour et al. (2016) modifies the phylogeographic GLM approach to use resistance surfaces to efficiently quantify landscape resistance along transmission pathways inferred by continuous phylogeographic analyses. These landscape resistances are then correlated with temporal estimates of transmission along these routes to estimate how the landscape has shaped rates and directions of pathogen spread. Such approaches are yet to be broadly applied, but appear to be important developments that should see increasing application in the future.",

            "text": "Overall, landscape genetics has been relatively underutilized in disease ecology research. We believe this is partly due to a lack of cross\u2010disciplinary awareness between the two fields, but also a lack of a clear landscape genetic framework specifically designed for tackling pathogen systems, which are often complex and do not facilitate easy translation of existing landscape genetic tools. However, we note there has been a recent effort to develop new frameworks for such research, expanding the utility of the landscape genetic toolset. These tools will increase our capacity to study complex multihost and host\u2010vector systems, improving the integration of multiple genetic datasets and accounting for interspecific interactions. Improved understanding of host\u2013parasite associations will facilitate the use of microparasite genetic markers to provide insights into host processes that may be difficult to detect using conventional host landscape genetics. Identification of idealized systems that are designed to target specific ecological questions will also facilitate progress in this field. Recent methods that enable the incorporation of quantitative landscape data into spatio\u2010temporal phylogenetic reconstructions of recent transmission events, coupled with advances in high\u2010throughput sequencing, hold great promise for studying how the landscape shapes transmission processes. We believe that these recent developments represent a renewed interest in advancing landscape genetic research in pathogen systems, which we expect will translate to continued growth of research in this area.",
