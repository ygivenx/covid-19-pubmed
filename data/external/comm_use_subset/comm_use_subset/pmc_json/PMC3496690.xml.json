Most respiratory infections which lead to cough are caused by viruses such as picornaviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenza, influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial viruses and adenoviruses. But they may also be caused by other pathogens such as human bocavirus or mycoplasma\n[5-8].",

This suggests, that whilst the vast majority of URTI are self-limiting, some may persist to cause a troublesome chronic cough\n[10]. Although concomitant conditions that could explain coughing (i.e. nasal disease, reflux disease, asthma) can be identified in a proportion of chronic cough patients, many of them respond poorly to specific therapy\n[11]. Furthermore the majority of patients presenting with typical symptoms of these conditions do not complain of severe cough, suggesting that whilst participating in triggering cough events, they may not be relevant to the development of chronic cough. Other, largely unknown, factors may be driving cough hypersensitivity and the associated inflammation.",

As similar unmyelinated C-fibre and thinly myelinated A\u03b4-fibre afferent nerves innervate the airways, skin and viscera it is tempting to infer a similar aetiology in cough.

Some patients present with BAL lymphocytosis with increased numbers of activated CD4+ Th1 cells\n[12], a phenomenon associated with autoimmune disease in chronic cough\n[13]. Infiltration of lymphocytes as a result of viral infection can sensitize neural pain responses in post-herpetic neuralgia\n[14] and respiratory infections are linked to neurological syndromes such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9\n[15,16]. Additionally, infection in murine models increases neuropeptide release which could activate neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1R) on both CD4+ T-cells\n[17], and sensory nerve terminals, reducing the excitation threshold for action potential initiation\n[18]. Both mycoplasmal and viral infections have been linked with the development of autoimmune reactions which could lead to CD4+ autoreactive T-cell mediated mucosal damage\n[19,20]. The presence of infection could also stimulate the production of cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2\n[21] and CXCL8 from macrophages and epithelial cells as well as activate mast cells.",

Although there have been many epidemiological studies investigating symptomatic respiratory infection, the incidence of asymptomatic carriage is less well known, although detection of persistent adenovirus and EBV has been documented in the lung\n[28,29]. Nevertheless, the pathogens detected in our study are reflected in other publications\n[30-33] and low rates of PCR detected coincident infection have also been reported by other authors\n[34]. For example, asymptomatic carriage of RSV and hMPV is rare. One study reported only one case of RSV and no cases of hMPV in 158 control patients\n[35], so it is unsurprising that these viruses were not detected in our subjects. In contrast, Chlamydophila pneumoniae frequently causes asymptomatic or low grade infection\n[36]. Serum microimmunofluroscence tests to Chlamydophila sp. report 64.3% seropositivity in healthy volunteers\n[37] and serological studies of Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection in COPD have found a significantly increased positivity (33%) when compared to healthy controls (7%)\n[38]. Overall, our study detected Chlamydophila sp. in 16.6% of subjects, 30% of controls but 10% of chronic cough patients, suggesting that prevalence might be lower in patients with chronic cough. There tended to be fewer detected pathogens in chronic cough group as a whole, compared with the healthy volunteer group, 20% vs 50% respectively but given the small sample size this was not significantly different. The protective effect of coughing, increased mucous production or a heightened immune state, might all account for this observation.",

In keeping with this finding, there was no difference in the objective cough counts between lymphocytic and non-lymphocytic groups [see Additional file\n2, implying that neither local infection nor the inflammatory process is obviously linked to cough severity. It is known that the long-term, predominantly monocytic, pathology of chronic infection differs markedly from that of the predominantly neutrophilic acute phase\n[39], suggestive of distinct infective activities and host responses. Indeed the mechanisms which promote cough in URTI, might be very different from those evident in chronic cough. For example, patients with chronic airway diseases might react differently to non-isomolar solutions than those with URTI\n[40] supporting the notion that distinct neuronal mechanisms might be important in chronic cough.",

The presence of such inflammation is common in a proportion of chronic cough patients\n[21,41], although it is difficult to draw the conclusion from the data collected in our study that this inflammation is related to an infective or autoimmune process. Nonetheless, the association between lymphocytosis, auto-immune disease and the modulation of neuronal function is well established in conditions such as IBD, neuropathic pain syndromes and many other neurological conditions\n[42-45]. It must be noted though, that the symptoms in these diseases are often attributed to auto-immune mediated damage of peripheral nerves where some modalities of sensation can be exaggerated whilst others are lost. In IBD patients, and multiple rodent models of colitis, T-cell mediated, neutrophilic and eosinophilic, inflammation results in necrosis of enteric axons and significant neuroplasticity\n[46]. The subsequent expansion of surviving neurons, observed in these models\n[47], probably accounts for the increased numbers of TRPV1 expressing neurons\n[48]. A similar mechanism might account for increased TRPV1 expression in chronic cough\n[49]. Moreover, some post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) patients report pain associated with healing onset rather than the appearance of lesions\n[50]. The mechanism by which the well documented nerve damage caused by autoimmune diseases might contribute to cough is not clear, although a form of infective or autoimmune ganglionitis is an intriguing possibility. Future studies should address this question.",

An involvement of respiratory viruses or consequent autoimmune lymphocytosis in chronic cough cannot be completely ruled out. Firstly, this study was not powered to detect differences between controls and chronic cough patients for organisms with a high prevalence in the general population. Secondly, the effects of infection can outlast the pathogen\n[51] and auto-immunity itself may only become apparent after a substantial period of time. In addition, we cannot preclude the existence of a current but undetected/undetectable infection, in the lung or at a distal site not sampled. In the case of PHN, Zoster infection is thought to lead to T-cell infiltration to selective dorsal root ganglia. This inflammation is associated with significant loss of myelinated neurons and atrophy of the dorsal horn\n[52]. Whilst VZV might still be detected in lymphocytic infiltrates in a number of ganglia, the affected peripheral tissue is not thought to be a viral reservoir\n[53].",

Through parallel comparison of chronic cough patients, sampled and tested in the same way as healthy volunteers, we have not been able to show an association between the presence of infection and lymphocytosis or cough reflex sensitivity. Given the limited sample sizes employed in this study, further work is required to fully define the potential role for infection in the mechanisms underlying chronic cough and the peripheral or central, nervous sensitisation or neuroplastic change which might contribute to reflex hypersensitivity. Whilst our study demonstrates that it is unlikely that all chronic cough is caused by a single infection, larger sample sizes will be needed in future studies, to fully address the extent to which a proportion of chronic cough patients might suffer from ongoing respiratory infection, as one of many potential causes of this condition.",
