Of 484 specimens, 283 (58.47%) were positive for viral agents. Of whom, 218 (77.03%) were mono-infection, 65 (22.97%) had mixed viral infection with at least one other virus. The most common viral etiologies of SARI were seasonal influenza A/H1N1 (16.32%) and rhino virus (15.5%). Pandemic influenza A/H1N1/09 was first detected in this surveillance system in week 42nd of 2009 and lasted for 4 weeks only. After that, there were only 2 cases detected. The proportion of specimens positive with pandemic influenza A/H1N1/09 increased from 50% (week 42nd) and became totally predominant (accounted for around 77-100 %) from week 43rd to week 45th, and suddenly decreased to 0 % in week 46th. Rhinovirus infection seems occurred seasonally with the majority of patients appearing from January to March. However, no seasonality was observed for other specific pathogens causing SARI. Interestingly, this study has detected the presence of a parainfluenza 4 outbreak and of sporadic human FluC cases in 2009. In addition, this study first identified the presence of human corona virus NL63 and HKU1 in Vietnam.",
