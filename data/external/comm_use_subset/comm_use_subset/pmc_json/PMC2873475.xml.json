It is commonly used for studies of infectious diseases and is susceptible to infection with a large number of pathogens, such as influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, and canine distemper virus [1-8]. The ferret is an essential model for influenza research as it develops a number of the clinical symptoms of influenza that are also seen in humans and, in contrast to mice, can be infected by human isolates of influenza virus [9]. With the recent two-animal ruling by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the licensing of drugs or vaccines directed against diseases of low or no incidence, the ferret represents an inexpensive small, non-rodent animal model. Despite the fact that ferrets have been used in biomedical research for decades, little is known about the genome of M. p. furo. Currently, there are only a limited number of partial or full length cDNAs present in the GenBank. This not only impacts the number of molecular genetic assays available for analysis, but also hinders the development of antibody-based assays, such as flow cytometry. The lack of reagents for molecular analysis of the mechanisms involved in infection and immunogenic protection is restricted, limiting the usefulness of this animal model.",

Global transcriptional changes detected using microarrays has improved our knowledge about virus-host interactions [17-19]. Examination of the mRNA levels in the host upon infection can help determine infection-specific transcriptional signatures and allow for distinction between different pathogens [20]. These functional genomic analyses may provide valuable knowledge about which components of the innate immune response the host activates to clear the pathogens, as well as the strategies that viruses or bacteria use to defeat these [21]. Identification of immune signatures can be used to assess the strength of the adaptive immune response and to predict protective immunity after vaccination [22]. To date, this type of analysis in the ferret is only possible through heterologous species array hybridization, which may introduce false positives due to the evolutionary distance between the target species and the microarray platform chosen (reviewed in [23]).",

The sequence reads were then assembled and annotated using a newly-developed annotation pipeline. The annotated reads were combined with ferret sequences already available in the GenBank, and used to create an oligonucleotide-based microarray.

Based on the annotations, these contigs represented a total of 11707 ferret genes. All contigs in the Ferret_seq1 group were used for microarray probe design. The remaining contigs were megablasted against the available genomic ferret sequence as well as the HTGS and the NT databases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). From these, 10710 contigs with sequence length larger than 100 bp and an e-value smaller than 10-5 were selected to be included on the ferret-specific microarray (called Ferret_seq2 here after).

We thus used the human GlobinClear \u00ae kit from Ambion to eliminate the globin interference and achieved an approximately 75% reduction of the globin mRNA (additional file 1). We further decreased the globin transcripts by complementing the human globin oligomix of the kit with ferret specific antisense RNA oligos directed towards the HBA and HBB genes, accomplishing an 85% reduction (additional file 1). We also hybridized blood-derived RNA with and without globin clear treatment on the ferret microarray.

Using the quality scores assigned for each probe by the Agilent's probe design algorithm (denoted as BC score, with a range from one - high quality to four - low quality), we excluded all probes with BC scores of three and above.

We also included 4210 ferret entries in the EST database and 132 mRNAs were retrieved from the sequence repositories at NCBI. The ESTs were blasted against themselves to remove overlapping EST entries leaving 2270 entries. The mRNA and the ESTs were then uploaded to the e-array portal, and again probes with BC scores of three and higher were excluded from the array.

The 609 probes on the ferret array corresponding to these genes were analyzed by ANOVA to filter out the genes that varied over the analyzed tissues despite being classified as housekeeping genes. More than 400 transcripts were significantly different (p-value distribution based on the 1000 permutations, p-value cut off of 0.001 and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing). The remaining transcripts were clustered using K-means clustering to distinguish between the genes that varied within each group from those that were truly non-variable between the groups. The latter indicate suitable housekeeping genes. We identified 41 genes from the Eisenberg and Levanon list with even expression across the tested tissues (Figure 4).",

We identified five housekeeping genes with even expression levels across the samples. We also selected three genes per tissue, with the exception of the spleen, that were highly expressed only in the specific tissue. Primers and TaqMan probes were designed for each of the transcripts individually. We also designed primers and TaqMan probes enabling multiplex analysis, allowing for simultaneous analysis of tissue specific transcripts and housekeeping genes in a single reaction. Based on the theoretical optimal pairs combinations, the genes encoding apolipoprotein H (Apo-H, liver), albumin (Alb, liver), pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc, lung), Claudin-18 (Cldn18, lung), Glycine receptor subunit beta (Glrb, brain), Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1, brain), ataxin 2-binding protein 1 (Fox1, brain), non-POU domain containing, octamer-binding protein (Nono, housekeeping gene) and lastly the activating transcription factor 4 gene (Atf4, housekeeping gene) were selected for analysis. We started the analysis by confirming the suitability of the two housekeeping genes. Both these genes showed even transcription profiles for the tested tissues. We then compared the relative expression differences between these genes. Based on the log2-transformed microarray data, the average difference of the fold-changes between the Nono and the Atf4 transcripts was approximately 3.5. Confirmatory analysis using qRT-PCR estimates this to be 3.0, which is in agreement with the microarray results (Figure 4). We also verified a number of the tissue-specific transcripts detected by the array analysis. The albumin and the pulmonary surfactant-associated protein C both showed low C(t) values, as expected. However, the fold-change ratio comparisons between the array data and qRT-PCR were higher when analyzed by qRT-PCR. A possible explanation is that the signal intensity of Alb and Sftpc genes is higher than the upper limit of the dynamic range of the microarray scanner. We then examined the Fox1 gene, exclusively expressed in the brain. This gene is expressed at lower levels than Alb and Sftpc, and the fold-change difference between Fox1 and Atf4 is approximately 1.5 when measured by the array and 0.5 when confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis (data not shown). Lastly, we tested several common housekeeping genes by real time PCR using SYBR green. These genes were the 60S ribosomal proteins L32 and L34 (Rpl32 and Rpl34) and the Sin3A-associated protein, 18 kDa (Sap18). As with the array analysis, the C(t) values across the tissues were more variable than the 41 selected by the ANOVA/K-means clustering analysis (data not shown).",

The generation of reagents is critical to probing further into the mechanisms of disease and infection using this model. The ferret animal model is highly adapted for studies of influenza virus infection because the animals develop a number of the symptoms of influenza that are also seen in humans [4-8]. A severe course of disease is seen when infecting the ferrets with highly pathogenic strains such as the H5N1 avian influenza strains [3,25]. Ferrets can be infected by human isolates of influenza virus, while mice, for example, require adapted strains [9]. Humans and ferrets share the same molecular structure of sialic acid residues, which serve as the receptor for influenza attachment to the host cell in the airway epithelium. This enables the influenza virus to use the same host cell entry mechanism. In addition to influenza virus, the ferret model has been shown useful for studies of SARS CoV infection [1], Canine distemper virus [26], Campylobacter sp. infection [27] as well as in Alzheimer's disease research [28].",

We used the GLOBINclear\u2122 kit to decrease the effect of alpha and beta globin mRNA expression in total RNA preparations derived from whole blood (Ambion, Austin, TX). Initially, sequence comparisons of the globin A, B and E genes from ferret, human and mouse were done using clustalw at the EBI server http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html with default settings. These comparisons showed that the ferret globin transcripts were more similar to the human orthologs than to those of mouse. We thus used the human GLOBINclear \u00ae kit from Ambion to reduce the globin interference.",

Samples with a cRNA synthesis yield below 1.65 \u03bcg and a specific activity less than 9.0 pmol Cy3 per \u03bcg cRNA were repeated. Labeled cRNA (1.65 \u03bcg) was then fragmented and mixed with the HI-RPM hybridization buffer and hybridized for 18-20 hours. The arrays were then washed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were then scanned using a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each slide was scanned at 5 \u03bcm resolution with two different PMT gain settings (450 and 480 V).

The raw data files were then opened in MS Excel \u00ae and the signal intensity (gProcessedSignal) was normalized by dividing all data points with the signal value of the 75th percentile of all of non-control probes (gPercentileIntensityProcessedSignal), as suggested by Agilent. The normalized expression data from each experiment was then copied into a multi-experiment spreadsheet and scaled using the average of the new spreadsheet containing the expression data from all signal values of the 75th percentile of the non-control probes, in accordance with the protocol from Agilent.

We also used principal component analysis and K-nearest neighbor's classification to classify the samples, using the default setting in MeV. Selection of tissue specific gene expression was done using one-way ANOVA analysis using p-value distribution based on the theoretical F-distribution, p-value cut off of 0.001 and Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. This analysis was followed by Pavlidis Template Matching (PTM) pattern, manually setting the thresholds for the specific expression patterns. The housekeeping genes were selected using a gene list derived from Eisenberg and Levanon and identified through ANOVA analysis and K-means clustering. From the gene list we selected genes not significantly changed between the tissue groups. To sort out genes with large intra tissue variability we subjected the non-significant hits to K-means clustering and then manually selected the clusters with no or limited variability between the tissues. These genes were then hierarchically clustered using Pearson correlation (Figure 4).",
