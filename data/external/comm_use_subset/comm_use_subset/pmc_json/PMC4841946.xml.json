IB affects chickens of all ages, causing respiratory, reproductive, and renal manifestations [1]. Although control of IBV infection is primarily achieved through live attenuated vaccines, the infection is difficult to contain because immunization with different serotypes of the virus do not necessarily cross-protect against other serotypes [2]. Within an infected poultry flock, quick and accurate detection of the presence of the virus is imperative to properly vaccinate uninfected flocks. In addition, rapid differentiation of IBV infection from other upper respiratory tract diseases (e.g., avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious laryngotracheitis, avian mycoplasmosis) is important so that appropriate measures can be taken in a timely manner [3].",

            "text": "Current diagnostic assays for IBV include virus isolation in embryonated eggs, tracheal organ culture, cell culture immunoassays, and molecular assays that detect viral RNA [10]. Virus isolation has been considered to be the reference standard. However, such isolations are expensive and time consuming because several passages may be required to detect the virus. Immunoassays use IBV-specific monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus in direct or indirect fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. Although faster and simpler than virus isolation, immunoassays tend to lack specificity and sensitivity. None of these immunoassays detect all strains or types of IBV [11\u201313]. Molecular assays, such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for the detection of IBV are commonly used because highly specific and sensitive results can be obtained in a timely manner. Molecular assays detect viral RNA directly from a clinical sample or from virus isolated in a laboratory host system. When RT-PCR is used to amplify the spike glycoprotein (S) of IBV, the assay can be coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or nucleic acid sequencing to identify serotypes of the virus [2, 10, 12\u201316]. More recently, many fluorescent probe-based real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed to detect IBV strains [2, 3, 9, 10, 15, 17]. Real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assays have been developed that amplify a fragment of the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the IBV genome to detect turkey coronaviruses and IBV [17] or that target the N gene for IBV detection [9].",

The main advantages of SYBR green I assays over other real-time PCR detection formats are: (1) SYBR green I is a low-cost fluorochrome; (2) SYBR green I assays are simpler to use, especially in regard to primer design and optimization procedures [25]; and (3) artifacts commonly observed in specific probes, particularly at amplification cycles beyond the 30th round, are minimal and can be ruled out by melting curve analysis.
