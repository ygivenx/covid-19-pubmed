An investigation was initiated to explore possible risk factors for illness. HMPV is a cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, particularly among young children (1) and older adults (2). In the United States, the typical HMPV season extends from November\u2013February through May\u2013July (3). No vaccine is currently available to prevent HMPV infection.",

The number of HMPV infections detected and the percentage of HMPV-positive respiratory virus panels from hospital A did not appear high compared with the same period in 2015 (hospital A, unpublished data, 2015 and 2016). Among the six patients identified in 2016 (Table), five had underlying medical conditions, including premature birth (three), congenital heart disease (three), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (two), developmental delay (three), and cerebral palsy (two). Four children required mechanical ventilation, and two of the four had acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumothorax. Two of the six patients died; both had considerable medical comorbidities. Four of the patients were American Indian; all four survived, although two required mechanical ventilation and two required supplemental oxygen. Two of the four American Indian children were transferred to hospital A from an Indian Health Service facility. During preliminary discussions with the North Dakota Department of Health, local Indian Health Service personnel did not describe a notable increase in respiratory illness during the investigation period, although testing for HMPV was not routinely done.",

Twenty-two patients were current or previous smokers. Ten patients required either mechanical ventilation (two) or noninvasive ventilation (eight); among these 10 patients, nine reported chronic lung disease. Three adult patients died.
