            "text": "According to the WHO, respiratory tract infections are still among the leading causes of death in children and adults worldwide [1]. The most common pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus are normal and transient residents of the nasopharyngeal (NP) niche, where they are embedded in a complex microbiota of generally presumed harmless commensals. The human microbiome in general is assumed beneficial to the host due to stimulation and maturation of immune systems, promotion of mucosal structure and function and providing actual \u2018colonization resistance\u2019 against pathogen invasion [2]. Although colonization by the \u201cpotential pathogens\u201d of the NP microbiome is mainly asymptomatic, progression towards upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia or even sepsis and meningitis may occur [3], [4]. The exact mechanisms by which this occurs remain largely unknown, although an imbalance in the composition of microbiota, for example by acquisition of new pathogens, viral co-infection or other host or environmental factors have been suggested [5]\u2013[8]. In addition, clear correlations between invasive attack rates and season are observed for many of the potential pathogens of the upper respiratory tract [9], [10], a phenomenon that cannot be fully explained by concomitant changes in colonization rates of the individual pathogenic bacteria [11], [12]. This suggests that local containment of the colonizing pathogenic bacteria by the host and/or the surrounding ecosystem is of major importance in prevention of disease progression. Despite an abundance of data on incidence, prevalence and density of potential pathogens in NP microbiota of children and adults, the detailed composition of the NP microbial community, both during health and disease have not been studied. We, therefore, performed a meta-genomic study on the detailed composition of and variability in NP microbiota in young children sampled during different seasons.",

            "text": "We studied the NP microbiota composition of 96 healthy 18-months old children. Their characteristics are depicted in Table S1. Being aware of the current discussions on the artefacts that may be introduced by pyrosequencing [13], [14], we applied a stringent protocol for filtering and clustering of sequences. The approx. 1 100 000 generated sequences (on average 11000 sequences per sample) yielded about 92 000 unique sequences, representing 13 taxonomic phyla and 243 species-level phyla types (OTUs). The data were normalized for equal numbers of reads per sample. The 5 most predominant phyla were Proteobacteria (64%), Firmicutes (21%), Bacteroidetes (11%), Actinobacteria (3%) and Fusobacteria (1.4%) (Figure 1). In addition, we found representatives of Cyanobacteria, probably reflecting plant chloroplasts obtained through inhalation. Sporadically and/or in low abundance we found sequences for the candidate divisions OD1, TM7 and BRC1 and the phyla Deinococcus-Thermus, Nitrospira, Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi. On a lower taxonomic level, the most prevalent genera were Moraxella (40%), Haemophilus (20%), Streptococcus (12%), and Flavobacterium (10%). Other fairly common genera were Dolosigranulum (5%), Corynebacterium (2%), Neisseria (2%) and Fusobacterium (1%). The 30 most common OTUs representing almost 98% of all reads, and their relative and absolute presence are shown in Table 1 (For the complete list of OTUs; see Table S2). Although the top 6 predominant phyla are identical to those of neighbouring microbiota, the composition, i.e. relative contribution of each phyla to those microbiota seems fairly different. In the oral cavity, microbiota are dominated by Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (overall 50% Gram-positive bacteria), whereas the microbiome of the nostril contains more than 80% gram-positive bacteria, mostly Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [15]. These data, therefore, suggest different dynamics (i.e., different biological equilibria) in the NP microbiome.",

This resulted in a limited core microbiome (as representing >0.1% of sequenes and being present in all 96 children) of specific phyla only, namely Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, however no single OTU was found universally. Because of the observed high inter-individual variation, we applied a less strict definition of core microbiome, i.e. OTUs present in more than 50% of all samples and representing >0.1% of the sequences. With this definition we observed a core microbiome of Moraxella, Haemophilus influenzae, Enhydrobacter (Proteobacteria), Streptococcus, Dolosigranulum (Firmicutes), and Corynebacterium (Actinobacteria) (Table 1).",

When distinguished by the time of sampling (fall/winter versus spring) groups of children did not differ significantly in demographics or life style characteristics, infectious symptoms, medical history or environmental parameters (Table S1), reducing the likelihood of internal confounders as a cause of potential seasonal correlations with microbiota profiles. However, with respect to microbiota profiles, we observed marked differences between samples obtained in fall/winter versus samples from spring (Table 2). In samples obtained in late fall and winter, we observed a predominance of Proteobacteria (relative abundance (% of all sequences): 75% versus 51% in spring), Fusobacteria (absolute abundance (% of children): 14% versus 2% in spring), and Cyanobacteria (absolute abundance: 64% versus 30% in spring; relative abundance: 0.27% versus 0.09% in spring) were significantly more abundant compared to spring, whereas Bacteroidetes were more frequently present in samples obtained in spring (relative abundance: 19% versus 3% in fall/winter, absolute abundance: 91% versus 54% in fall/winter) (Figure 3a). On OTU level we observed amongst others more Bacillus, Brevibacillus and Lactobacillus species, and Flavobacterium and B. fragilis (both Bacteroidetes) in samples from spring compared to fall/winter. In addition we found less \u03b1-Proteobacteria, Oxalobacteriaceae, Microbacteriaceae, Ralstonia, Pseudomonas and Acidovorax (all Proteobacteria), Cyanobacteria, and Porphyromonas catoniae (Bacteroidetes) in samples from spring compared to fall/winter (Figure 3b). When re-evaluating the core microbiome per individual season (i.e. OTUs present in more than 50% of samples of a certain season), we observed an additional core of Proprionibacterium and Cyanobacteria for fall/winter and an additional core of Flavobacteria, Brevibacillus and Bacillus (almost exclusively) for spring. The latter groups of bacteria, i.e. Bacteroidetes and (Brevi)bacillus and Lactobacillus species, are generally related to protection against overgrowth of pathogenic species due to the production of bacteriocins and other inhibitory substances [7], [16]. In other microbiota like the gastrointestinal and vaginal tract they are highly related to maintenance of a balanced microbiome as well [17]\u2013[19]. Since infections with respiratory pathogens, especially pneumonia, are strongly related to fall and winter season [9], [10], the presence and abundance of these bacteria in respiratory microbiota in spring might therefore suggest in general a more balanced respiratory microbiome in this specific season as well protecting against onset of respiratory or invasive infections.",

We found no evidence for associations between the observed seasonal shift in microbiota and the overall presence of respiratory viruses, nor for any of the individual viruses when tested by SAM analysis (Figure 3b). Although these data do not exclude an effect of respiratory viruses on microbiota composition, they do suggest other season-related factors like environmental factors (temperature, humidity, smoke exposure, crowding), or nutrient- or vitamine-related effects, or a combination of factors might be important for the observed shifts in microbiota profiles [3], [16], [20]. Interestingly, day-care attendance or smoke exposure could not be related to the observed shifts in microbiota, although the latter was encountered very rarely. This further underlines that different or more complex effect may be responsible for the observed phenomenon. In addition, no association was observed between seasonal changes in microbiota and recent antibiotic use, which was rather limited in this population (Table 1, Figure 3b). Because of the explicit correlation between season and microbiota profiles, correlations between other environmental determinants and microbiota could not be accurately tested, which underlines that in future studies one needs to control and power for seasonal effects.",

On average, 76% of the overall NP microbiome in children was composed of Gram-negative bacteria, however with a wide range of 9\u201399% Gram-negative bacteria per sample. In addition, there was a higher contribution of Gram-negative bacteria to microbiota obtained in fall/winter (81%) compared to spring (72%) (Independent samples t-test: p = 0.044).

In line with other human body habitats, we found a complex, diverse and highly variable microbiota with a relatively limited core microbiome. There is considerable seasonal variation in NP microbiota. This implies the time of sampling should be considered when describing or comparing NP microbiomes, and preferably controlled for when other potential determinants like the impact of viruses or antibiotics on microbiota profiles or the correlation between microbiota profiles and diseases will be tested. Whether these seasonal changes in composition of the NP microbome are causally related to seasonal occurrence of respiratory tract infections remains to be determined, though seems relevant for further understanding of pathogenesis of infectious diseases and in the long run potentially for understanding of effects of current and design of future preventive measures.",
