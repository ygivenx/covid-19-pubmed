            "text": "Lung alveolar epithelium is composed of type I and type II cells (Mason 2006). Alveolar epithelial type II (AEII) cells are cuboidal and constitute 60% of all alveolar epithelial cells (Crapo et al. 1982). AEII cells play a key role in maintaining the integral function of the pulmonary alveolus (Driscoll et al. 1995), and serve as progenitors of AEI cells contributing to alveolar epithelial repair (Uhal 1997; Fehrenbach 2001). AEII cells are considered as a defender of the alveolus given their physiological and biological functions to synthesize, secrete, and recycle all components of the surfactant that controls alveolar surface tension (Mason and Williams 1977). AEII cells regulate the transepithelial sodium ion transport for alveolar fluid clearance, modulate the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and thus contribute to the host defense system. AEII cells not only guide neutrophils into the alveolar space during their emigration (Burns et al. 2003) but also act as effector cells through interaction with resident and mobile cells, either directly by cell\u2013cell contact or indirectly by ligand\u2013receptor crosstalk through releasing cytokines and growth factors. AEII cells are particularly vulnerable to mechanical stress, as evidenced in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in the context of ventilator-induced lung injury, and in ex vivo model of mechanical stretch systems of lung epithelial cells (Dreyfuss et al. 1988; Hotchkiss et al. 2002; Cabrera-Benitez et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2012).",

This differential adhesion procedure was repeated three times, and then the AEII cells were gently collected and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at room air. The cell pellets were resuspended in 3 mL DME/F12 and the crude cell suspension was layered on a 1.040\u20131.089 g/mL discontinuous Percoll gradients. A solution of 40 mL light gradient (1.040 g/mL) contained 4 mL PBS 10\u00d7, 12.55 mL Percoll solution (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and 23.45 mL distilled water. A solution of 40 mL heavy gradient (1.089 g/mL) contained 4 mL PBS 10\u00d7, 25.96 mL Percoll\u00ae solution (MP Biomedicals), 10.04 mL distilled water, and one drop of phenol red. Each solution at 3 mL of volume was gently loaded into FBS of 15-mL centrifuge tubes, followed by centrifugation at 300 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C using a swing out rotor to generate an enriched layer of AEII cells at the interface between the two layers of Percoll gradients. The deceleration was achieved by turning off the power when the desired centrifugation time was reached. The enriched cell pellets were transferred to a 15-mL centrifuge tube containing 13 mL BSS and centrifuged twice at 300 g for 10 min at room air. The cells pellets were resuspended in 2 mL BSS and a magnetic bead separation approach was applied to remove any possible contamination of macrophages (Anti-CD14 MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The isolated AEII cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min at room air, resuspended in 2 mL SAGM containing 1% FBS, and incubated in 60-mm culture dishes at 37\u00b0C for 60 h while medium was changed every other day. The cells were then subcultured in either SAGM or DMEM containing either 1% or 10% FBS for up to 21 days.",

It is necessary to establish primary culture of human AEII cells for our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms under pathological conditions of the lung diseases such as the lethal ARDS and ventilator-induced lung injury. Since Dobbs (Dobbs et al. 1986) first published a method of isolation and culture of adult rat ATII cells, a number of studies have been carried out to isolate AEII cells in humans (Fuchs et al. 2003; Bove et al. 2010) and in rodents (Bates et al. 2002; Witherden et al. 2004; Lazrak et al. 2012). The studies have shown that the isolated human AEII cells exert function in vitro (Wang et al. 2007, 2011; Ballard et al.2010; Qian et al. 2013; Bove et al. 2014). However, several major concerns have arose including rapid loss of cell function, especially loss of surfactant protein expression (Dobbs 1990; Bates et al. 2002; Witherden et al. 2004) and cell differentiated into ATI phenotype within a few days (Bates et al. 2002; Bove et al. 2010).",

In this study, we modified the protocols from several previous studies for AEII cell isolation, characterization, and culture. First, we used the normal peripheral lung tissue from patients undergoing lung resection as our tissue source. Second, the combined application of trypsin with elastase was able to decrease the dosage of trypsin and thus may have helped reduce tissue injury and improved harvest (Waymouth 1974). Third, we believe that the removal of fibroblasts is a crucial step during the isolation and purification procedure (Komiyama et al. 2003; Kaushik et al. 2008). Finally, the SAGM containing 1%FBS was an important recipe in maintaining the biological characteristics of human AEII cells and preventing their differentiation into AEI cells.",

SAGM contains epinephrine, hydrocortisone, and retinoic acid, which appears to be important for inhibition of differentiation (Rippon et al. 2004). The epidermal growth factor in SAGM can promote cell proliferation in mammalian cells (Worster et al. 2012). We demonstrate that SAGM supplemented with 1% FBS but not 10% FBS was able to maintain the AEII phenotypes, but the other kinds of medium containing different concentration of FBS failed to maintain the AEII cell phenotype. Although the AEII cell population doubling was somewhat slow, the phenotype of AEII cells appeared to last longer (i.e., over 20 days) as compared to previous studies (Bates et al. 2002; Witherden et al. 2004; Bove et al. 2010). This time frame is usually long enough for common mechanistic studies in vitro following insults such as mechanical stretch, hypoxic exposure and acid challenge (Ishizuka et al. 2001; Bouvry et al. 2006; Cabrera-Benitez et al. 2012).",

A technical challenge of primary AEII cell culture was the rapid loss of expression of surfactant proteins (Dobbs 1990; Witherden et al. 2004). Our AEII phenotype was evidenced by the sustained expression of surfactant proteins (Ballard et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2011; Qian et al. 2013), epithelial markers (KL-6, CK-8) (Driscoll et al. 1995; Hermans and Bernard 1999), and AEII cell differentiation marker of AQP-3 while lacking AQP-5 of an AEI cell marker (Armstrong et al. 2004). Finally, the primary AEII cells also showed excellent biological function by upregulation of cytokines, chemokine, and adhesion molecule at gene and protein levels in response to stimulation with TNF-\u03b1. This provides an important tool to study inflammatory responses involved in AEII cells.",
