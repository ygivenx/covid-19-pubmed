HSV-1 infection triggers a rapid induction of cellular defense responses. One of the earliest responses to infection is activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR). An important function of activated PKR during viral infection is phosphorylation of the eukayotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, resulting in translational arrest and reduction in the global synthesis of viral and cellular proteins2. In some cases, viral invasion also induces other host defense responses, including type I interferon (IFN)3,4 and autophagy5, which in turn affect viral infection of HSV-1.",

Viral protein \u03b334.5 of HSV-1 wild type F consists of 263 amino acids, and can be divided into three domains: a 160-aa amino-terminal domain, 10 repeats of 3-aa (Ala-Thr-Pro), and a 73-aa carboxyl-terminal domain7. Multiple roles of \u03b334.5 have emerged from the association of \u03b334.5 with various cellular proteins in targeting different host pathways. For instance, \u03b334.5 interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), suppressing production of type I IFN8,9. \u03b334.5 directly interacts with the mammalian autophagy protein Beclin-1 and antagonizes autophagy10. Moreover, HSV-1 has evolved an effective strategy through \u03b334.5 recruiting protein phosphatase PP1\u03b1 to reverse the eIF2\u03b1-mediated translational arrest, to allow for successful viral replication11\u201313. \u03b334.5 was initially described over two decades ago, but the specific virus-host interactions mediated by this multifunctional protein are still being elucidated.",

Depression of NOP53 sensitizes cells to DNA damage, delays DNA repair, and abolishes G2/M checkpoint activation18. Localization of NOP53 is mediated by multiple unique nucleolar localization sequences19. Nucleolar NOP53 can translocate to nucleoplasm and stabilize p53 in response to the ribosomal stress20.

We ectopically expressed the wild-type (wt) Flag-tagged NOP53 (residues 1 to 478), truncated NOP53-N4 (residues 250 to 478), or negative control and then infected them with HSV-1/F at the MOI of 0.1. As shown in Figs. 1a and 1b, increase of NOP53 and NOP53-N4 resulted in increases of intracellular viral yields by 14.3 and 8.8 fold, respectively, at 36 h post-infection (h.p.i.), and by 13.6 and 8.9 fold, respectively, at 48 h.p.i., in comparison with the negative control infected with HSV-1/F (Fig. 1a). Increase of NOP53 and NOP53-N4 resulted in increase of extracellular viral yields by 14.7 and 10.6 fold, respectively, at 36 h.p.i., and by 12.6 and 12.6 fold, respectively, at 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 1b). We also detected that ectopic expression of the full length NOP53 enhances viral replication, indexed by viral protein HSV-ICP8, while NOP53-N4 appears to enhance viral replication to a level comparable to that achieved with wt NOP53 (Fig. 1c). These preliminary results indicated that the integrity of the C-terminal region N4 is important for NOP53 in support of viral replication. We then found that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of NOP53 results in reduction of viral yields by 31.1 and 52.3 fold at 36 and 48 h.p.i., respectively (Fig. 1d). Western blot results also showed that the level of viral protein HSV-ICP8 is down-regulated (Fig. 1e). In addition, over-expression or knockdown of NOP53 did not cause measurable decrease in cell viability (Supplementary figure 1). These results suggest that NOP53 promotes the production of viral particles and increases the level of viral proteins of HSV-1/F in IFN-independent fashion.",

In agreement with earlier findings27, gradual infection of HSV-1 moderately modulated global protein synthesis (Fig. 2a, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8).

RT-PCR was used to elucidate the levels of viral mRNA; we detected that ectopic expression of both NOP53 and NOP53-N4 significantly up-regulate the level of viral mRNA (Fig. 2c). NOP53-N4 also enhanced viral replication to a level comparable to that achieved under enhancement by wt NOP53 in HeLa cells. On the other hand, siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOP53 resulted in reduction of viral yields by 24 and 33 fold at 36 and 48 h.p.i., respectively (Fig. 2d), and also a reduction in the level of viral mRNA (Fig. 2e). These results indicate that NOP53 improves the production of viral particles and level of viral proteins of HSV-1/F, without affecting global protein synthesis.",

There are two main regulatory steps that control polypeptide chain initiation: the activity of the Met-tRNA-binding factor eIF2 complex and the formation of the eIF4F mRNA cap-binding complex28,29. The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 on serine 51 (Ser51) prevents recycling of the trimeric eIF2 complex, resulting in translation initiation attenuation30,31, while the eIF4E controls eIF4F complex formation and cellular translation via phosphorylation on serine 209 (Ser209)32,33. In this study, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged NOP53-N4 or negative control and then infected with HSV-1 at MOI of 10 for 8, 12, 24, and 36 h. As shown in Fig. 2f, we found that HSV-1 infection significantly enhances the level of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) and phospho-eIF4E (p-eIF4E) at 8 and 12 h.p.i.

The best-studied antiviral defense targeting viral translation is the dsRNA-dependent PKR37. To test whether NOP53 targets PKR for p-eIF2\u03b1 depression, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Flag-tagged NOP53-N4 or negative control, and then infected with HSV-1/F for 12 and 18 h.

To clarify the relationship of NOP53 redistribution with viral replication, DNA polymerase inhibitor PMEG42 was used for nuclear and cytoplasmic separation analysis. As shown, replication inhibitor PMEG led to the sequestration of NOP53 in the nuclei of HSV-1/F infected cells, without affecting the level of NOP53 expression (Fig. 4c). To investigate whether viral infection might modulate NOP53 level in cells, we studied the time-course of NOP53 during HSV-1 infection, and detected that NOP53 level was not significantly affected (Fig. 4d).

As shown in Fig. 4e, endogenous NOP53 overwhelmingly migrated from nucleus to cytoplasm of HeLa cells after HSV-1/F infection at 12 and 24 h.p.i. (d-i); and the discrete globular structures were slightly dispersed in nuclei of HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5-infected cells (j-o). To further study whether \u03b334.5 participates in the redistribution of NOP53, we ectopically expressed GFP-tagged NOP53 in cells and then infected them with HSV-1/F (Fig. 4f, i\u2013l) or HSV-1/ \u0394\u03b334.5 (m-p). The cytoplasmic translocation of exogenous NOP53 was observed only in HSV-1/F-infected cells. Upon infection, HSV-1/F exhibited nearly 100 fold higher replication than HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5;43 ectopic expression of \u03b334.5 can efficiently rescue viral replication of \u0394\u03b334.5 to the extent of HSV-1/F13. To verify whether \u03b334.5 directly stimulates NOP53 migration, HeLa cells were ectopically expressed with GFP-tagged NOP53 and Flag-tagged \u03b334.5 (u\u2013x), and were then infected with HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5. Thus, the redistribution of exogenous NOP53 was observed in repaired HSV-1 (\u0394\u03b334.5 R) infected cells. These results demonstrate that \u03b334.5 induces the cytoplasmic translocation of NOP53.",

In consideration of the relationship between NOP53 redistribution and viral replication priority, N4-T protein was employed in this study. First, HeLa cells were exposed to HSV-1/F in the presence or absence of N4-T, to explore whether N4-T promotes viral proliferation. As shown in Fig. 5a, the viral yields of HSV-1/F at 24, 36, 48, and 72 h.p.i. were 6, 62, 44, and 13 fold higher, respectively, in cells treated with N4-T at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml, than in cultures treated with PBS. We also explored the effect of N4-T on the level of viral protein throughout the infection course, and found significantly up-regulated expression of HSV-ICP8 (Fig. 5b). We further examined whether N4-T promotes HSV-1 replication via regulation of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. The results revealed that p-eIF2\u03b1 level is gradually decreased and HSV-ICP8 expression is up-regulated, with increasing concentrations of N4-T (Fig. 5c). N4-T treatment failed, however, to affect the levels of p-eIF2\u03b1 and HSV-ICP8 upon HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 infection (Fig. 5d). N4-T also had no effect on the p-eIF2\u03b1 level induced by unrelated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection, although it up-regulated the expression of viral protein NP (Fig. 5e). It is possible that N4-T promotes NDV replication by suppressing the activity of IFN-\u03b2. These findings indicate that cytoplasmic NOP53 directly depresses p-eIF2\u03b1 level in the presence of \u03b334.5.",

Increase of NOP53 and NOP53-N4 resulted in an increase in extracellular viral yields of 3.9 and 2.6 fold respectively at 36 h.p.i., and 5.8 and 4.7 fold respectively at 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 6b). Under the current experimental conditions, we found that both NOP53 and NOP53-N4 subtly promote viral replication, as indexed by viral protein HSV-ICP8 (Fig. 6c). On the other hand, knockdown of NOP53 barely reduced the production of viral particles. At 36 and 48 h.p.i., NOP53 decrease resulted in reduction of viral yields by 1.3 and 6.3 fold respectively (Fig. 6d). These results reveal that NOP53 has a mild effect on the replication of HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 in Vero cells, indicating that \u03b334.5 is required for NOP53 function to promote HSV-1 replication in type I IFN-independent manner.",

The crucial functional regions of \u03b334.5 that are associated with NOP53 were determined by construction of Flag-tagged \u03b334.5 and a series of variant plasmids, including N-terminus region (residues 1 to 190), C-terminus region (residues 190 to 263), Beclin-1 binding motif deleted mutant (\u039468\u201387), and site mutation of V193E and F195L (Fig. 7a). Specifically, both the V193 and F195 sites are required for \u03b334.5 to bind to PP1\u03b113. In the present study, we used GFP-specific antibody to immune-precipitate ectopically-expressed GFP-tagged NOP53-N4, and used Flag-specific antibody in Western blotting to detect whether Flag-tagged \u03b334.5 was present in the immune complex. The result revealed that NOP53-N4 can interact with \u03b334.5 (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, we found that NOP53-N4 is in the immune complex with \u03b334.5 and its variants; no interaction was observed, however, between NOP53-N4 and the C-terminus region of \u03b334.5 (Fig. 7c). To summarize, NOP53 interacts directly with \u03b334.5 but does not rely on \u03b334.5 binding to cellular proteins PP1\u03b1, Beclin-1, or eIF2\u03b1.",

As shown in Fig. 7e, the ectopic expression of \u03b334.5 up-regulated the expression of HSV-ICP8 in control cells, but failed to play a role in NOP53 knockdown cells. Our findings revealed that NOP53 is essential for \u03b334.5 to maintain HSV-1 virulence. We also found that NOP53 knockdown does not repress the accumulation of exogenous \u03b334.5, demonstrating that NOP53 is unrelated to regulating the stabilization of \u03b334.5.

Eosinophils, inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrotic cells with pyknotic nuclei were observed in the livers of infected mice (c). In NOP53 knockdown mice (e) and UL18 knockdown mice (g), no obvious inflammatory cell infiltration was observed, although a few eosinophils and necrotic cells were observed. Furthermore, there was a large number of ICP8-positive cells in the livers of control shRNA treated mice (d); the numbers were greatly decreased under treatment with NOP53-specific shRNA (f) or UL18-specific shRNA (h). The results indicate that NOP53 depression significantly reduces both virus growth in vivo and the associated inflammatory response.",

The phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 plays a principal role in shutoff of protein translation to protect host cells against viruses. Therefore, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade or subvert this antiviral defense response for successful replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that certain viral gene products are able to recruit PP1\u03b1 to counteract eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation; these include the DNA virus protein DP71L protein of African swine fever virus (ASFV)46,47, E6 oncoprotein of human papillomavirus (HPV)48, and RNA virus protein 7 of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)49. It is well understood that HSV-1 \u03b334.5 mediates the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, but the cellular regulatory protein that is involved in this process has yet to be determined.",

            "text": "HSV-1 infection triggers a rapid induction of host innate immune responses. Herpesvirus DNA can be recognized intracellularly by a variety of DNA sensors, with the best documented being the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, which initiates subsequent type I IFN production50,51. It has recently been reported that RIG-I-mediated STING up-regulation restricts HSV-1 infection52. Our previous study revealed that NOP53 targets RNA sensor RIG-I to suppress the activity of IFN-\u03b2 for efficient viral replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and NDV21. It has been reported that HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 infection produces greater amounts of IFN-\u03b2 than in HSV-1/F-infected cells53. We found, however, that the increase of NOP53, in two forms of transient transfection and in vitro expression, was unable to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 and promote viral replication upon HSV-1/\u0394\u03b334.5 infection. In addition, NOP53 promoted HSV-1/F replication in type I IFN-deficient Vero cells. Two major lines of evidence thus support that \u03b334.5 manipulates NOP53 to promote HSV-1 replication mainly by regulating IFN-independent eIF2\u03b1 activity. This improves our understanding of how the viruses manipulate NOP53 for efficient replication via negatively regulating distinct antiviral responses produced by the infected cells.",
