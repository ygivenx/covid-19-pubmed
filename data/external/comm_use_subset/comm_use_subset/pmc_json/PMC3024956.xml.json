Viral shedding curves (Figure 5A) indicated that the mice in the PBS group shed virus as early as 2 days after challenge. The viral shedding in each experimental group decreased to various degrees after challenge. Reduction in shedding (Figure 5B) of the VLP+rAd group was the highest (92.9%), with more than 50% of reduction in each mouse. Reductions in shedding of the VLP group, the rAd+VLP group, and the rAd group were 76.7%, 36.1%, and 31.1%, respectively. These numbers were lower than those of the VLP+rAd group, and varied largely among individuals in each group. Our results suggest that the VLP2/6 prime-rAdVP6 boost regimen is more effective than other regimen in conferring immunoprotection against RV challenge in mice.",

In contrast, the VLP+rAd group not only elicited high level humoral, mucosal, and cellular immunities, but also protected against RV challenge and effectively reduced the amount of virus shedding.

The reasons for this disparity are unclear. One possible explanation may be the difference in inducing innate immunity between rAd and VLP, which leads to a difference in type and strength of the adaptive immune responses [29]. VLP and rAd are recognized by different pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors [35,36], which may lead to differences in cytokine activation. The sequence of prime-boost immunization may also affect the cytokine milieu. This milieu may determine the final direction, strength, and breadth of various adaptive immunities, including the balance between Th1 and Th2 immune responses through different mechanisms [37]. However, these mechanisms cannot be unravelled by our data alone. A systems biology approach to analyze the markers of the immune responses by different prime-boost regimens may be needed [38].",

Viral shedding curves for each animal were plotted, and the areas under the curves for each animal were calculated. Reduction in shedding was calculated for each immunized animal by comparing the area under the curve to the mean of the areas under the curves of the control group. Reduction in shedding was then calculated for each vaccination group by determining the mean reduction of each vaccinating group. A >50% reduction in virus shedding for an individual animal or for a group was considered significant protection from virus challenge.",
