Coronaviruses, which are enveloped viruses with positive sense, 5Vcapped and 3Vpolyadenylated RNA genomes, range from 27.6 to 32 kb [1]. Two thirds of the coronavirus genome encodes the replicase activity, including a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and viral proteinases. The remaining one third of the genome encodes the structural proteins and small group-specific ORFs [1]. Recently, there have been occasional outbreaks of infectious bronchitis (IB) and it remains one of the most important poultry diseases in many countries of the world [2,3,4]. Consequently, study and exploiture an effective anti-IBV medicine have significant value and broad interest. ",

The S protein interacts with cellular receptors and induces cell and viral membrane fusion [5]. The E and M proteins are localized in ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and considered to play critical roles in viral budding [6,7]. N proteins, which interact with viral genomic RNA, forming ribonucleocapsid (RNP) complexes, have been associated with replication and transcription [8,9,10]. It is a highly immunogenic phosphoprotein also implicated in viral genome replication and in modulating cell signaling pathways. The N-terminal of N-protein (NTD) serves as a functional unit critical for the specific interaction with RNA, where exhibits a U-shaped structure, with two arms rich in basic residues [11]. Additionally, the key functional residues of NTD are highly conserved among coronaviruses between different antigenic groups [12,13,14]. The N protein has been a major protein target in the exploration of anti-IBV medicine [11,12,13,14,15,16]. ",

These two values were both much higher than that of ribavirin (0.78 \u00b1 0.15 mM) (P < 0.01). These results indicated compared with ribavirin, both (-)-\u03b1-pinene and (-)-\u03b2-pinene possessed lower cytotoxicity on Vero cells.

In all experiments cells infected with untreated virus were used as control. The percent reduction was calculated relative to the amount of virus produced in the absence of the drug. As shown in Figure 2, ribavirin showed the maximum antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 0.78 \u00b1 0.15 mM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 90.18 \u00b1 2.80% for IBV. As is commonly known, ribavirin interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication [23]. However, no significant effect was detected when ribavirin was used for pretreatment of cells or viruses or when ribavirin was only added during the adsorption phase. Unlike ribavirin, (-)-\u03b1-pinene showed the maximum noncytotoxic antiviral activity when added at a concentration of 7.88 \u00b1 0.06 mM during the replication period with inhibition of the viral replication of 86.98 \u00b1 3.04% for IBV, whereas, it also showed inhibition of 67.64 \u00b1 2.31% in the pretreatment virus phase. Similarly to (-)-\u03b1-pinene, (-)-\u03b2-pinene also showed significant anti-IBV inhibition during the replication period and pretreatment virus phase, with the inhibition of 81.02 \u00b1 1.48% and 55.41 \u00b1 1.64%. These results suggested that the inhibitions of (-)-pinenes against IBV appear to moderately occur before entering the cell but much stronger occur after penetration of the virus into the cell. Additionally, biochemical studies indicated that the bioactivity of N protein is an important target for the replication of IBV virus [11,13,16]. Hence, we infer that N protein may be suppressed by (-)-pinenes.",

Further studies on the anti-IBV mechanism are needed to support this point of view.

The values (Esum) amounted to \u22126.32 and \u22122.65 kcal mol\u22121, respectively (Table 2).
