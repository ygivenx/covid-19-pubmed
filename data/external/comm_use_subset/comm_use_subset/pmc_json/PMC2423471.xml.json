They induce a so-called \u201cantiviral state\u201d by inducing both cytosolic and nuclear events. IFN Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) is an Ubiquitin (Ub)-Like molecule (UbL), highly induced upon both type I and type II IFN treatment [1]. It is expressed as a 17 kDa protein, containing 2 Ub domains and a C-terminal oligopeptide (eg. octapeptide in human, hexapeptide in mice). Maturation of ISG15 includes N-terminal Met excision [2] and removal of the C-terminal peptide giving a 15 kDa protein [3]. Maturated ISG15 can then be conjugated via an isopeptide binding to the \u03b5-amino group of a Lys residue in the target protein [4]. Alternatively, the processed 15 kDa ISG15 molecule can be secreted and exerts immunoregulatory functions on peripheral blood lymphocytes [5].",

            "text": "Conjugation of Ub(L) requires the cooperative activity of at least 3 enzymes. The ubiquitination cascade is initiated by an Ub-Activating enzyme (termed Uba, Ube or E1) adenylating the C-terminus of Ub(L), thereby forming an acyl-phosphate linkage with AMP. The catalytic Cys residue in UbE1 subsequently attacks this high energy bond, forming a thiolester bond to the C-terminal Gly of Ub(L). In humans, Ub molecules are found to be activated by UbE1 (also known as A9S1) [6] or UbE1L2 (also named Uba6) [7], [8], ISG15 by UbE1L [9], SUMO by AOS-Uba1 [10] and Nedd8 by AppBp1-Uba3[11]. Ub(L) molecules thiolester-linked to its Ub-Activating enzyme are transferred to a Ub-Conjugating enzyme (termed Ubc or E2), also by a thiolester linkage on a Cys residue. UbcH8 has been identified as a major Ub-Conjugating enzyme effecting ISG15 conjugation [12], [13]. Around 400 proteins are recognized as Ub-Ligases or E3s. Roughly, they can be discerned as RING (Really Interesting New Gene)-finger proteins, acting as a molecular scaffold, and HECT (Homologous to E6-AP C-Terminus)-domain proteins, which also exert a catalytic contribution. Ub-Ligases confer specificity, and place the Ub or UbL molecule in close proximity to the Lys residue of the substrate. The formation of polyubiquitin chains is a process mediated by the Ub-Conjugating enzyme together with the Ub-Ligase. Recently, the IFN-induced HERC5 has been identified as an ISG15 E3-Ligase in human cells [14]. The Estrogen-response Finger Protein (EFP), also an IFN-induced protein, functions as an E3-Ligase for ISGylation of 14-3-3\u03b4 [15]. Definitely, these recently discovered ISG15-Ligases are only the onset of a more extensive list. As Ub, most UbLs are synthesized as inactive precursors, being processed by De-UBiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) exposing the mature protein with a C-terminal Gly residue. DUBs not only exert their function by protein processing, they also have a function in removal of the Ub(L) from their substrate. Ub Specific Protease 2 (USP2), USP5 (also named Isopeptidase T), USP13 (IsoT3) and USP14 have been identified as proteases with a dual specificity for Ub and ISG15 [16], [17]. USP18 (also named UBP43) specifically cleaves ISG15 [18]. Of note, USP18 also competes with Jak1 for binding to the Type I IFN receptor IFNaR2 [19].",

            "text": "ISG15 is upregulated upon viral infection. Its role in antiviral defense is underscored by viral mechanisms to counteract ISG15 function. For example, the influenza B Non-Structural NS1B protein binds ISG15, thereby preventing its association to UbE1L [9]. Also the papain-like protease of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus, counteracts ISG15 functioning by removing it from its substrate [20]. The Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease cleaves IFN Promoter-Stimulator-1 (IPS-1) leading to reduced ISG15 expression and conjugation [21]. In a more direct way, ectopic expression of ISG15 in cells lacking a functional IFN response reduces Newcastle Disease Virus and Influenza Virus replication [22], and also overcomes fatal intracerebral infection in IFNaR\u2212/\u2212 mice by Sindbis Virus [23]. ISG15 knock-out mice proved to be more sensitive to Influenza, Herpes and Sindbis viral infection [24]. An inverse dose-response correlation of exogenously expressed ISG15 and release of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virions is also found and suppression of ISG15 expression by siRNA counteracts IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV virion release [25].",

We compared ISG15 sequences from hominid origin with those of OWm, which diverged some 25 million years ago, and of murine origin, which diverged from primates approximately 75 million years ago [29]. ISG15 from different origins were aligned to two Ub molecules (Figure 1). The N- and C-terminal part of ISG15 share respectively 32 and 37% sequence identity with Ub. The ISG15 variability largely exceeds what can be expected by genetic drift alone [2].",

Human fibroblast 2fTGH cells were stably transfected with these constructs, and 2 cell clones expressing TAP-tagged HuISG15 or TAP-tagged AgmISG15 with comparable expression levels were selected (see Figure S1). To rule out experimental variation, this experiment was also performed in transiently transformed HekT cells with either TAP-tagged HuISG15 or AgmISG15. As shown in Table 2, the TAP experiments identified substantially more ISGylation substrates of AgmISG15 compared to HuISG15 in human cell-lines. Details of the identified peptides can be found in Table S1.

Western blot analysis on total cell lysates containing \u03b2-ME confirmed ISGylation of UbcH10, H13 and H17 with AgmISG15 but not with HuISG15, as seen by a 15 kDa shift upon staining with anti-V5 Ab detecting the ectopic expressed UbcH proteins (Figure 3a,b and Figure S2a). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by binding ISGylated proteins through ISG15's FLAG-tag to an anti-FLAG affinity gel. Also here, the ISGylation of UbcH10, H13 and H17 by AgmISG15 could be established (Figure 3c). Worth mentioning, when the co-immunoprecipitated samples were obtained in a more concentrated way, a faint band of co-immunoprecipitated UbcH13 and UbcH17 could be seen with HuISG15 (Figure S2b), hinting at a qualitative rather than quantitative difference in ISGylation between Hu and AgmISG15.",

We performed an in vitro assay analyzing the loading of either HuISG15 or AgmISG15 with HuUbE1 or HuUbE1L. Thiolester formation of both ISG15 orthologues with HuUbE1L was observed, as expected. Importantly, as anticipated from the sequence similarity, HuUbE1 was also found to be able to form thiolester bonds with AgmISG15, whilst no loading of HuISG15 could be seen (Figure 7a). The thiolester nature of the bond was verified by addition of \u03b2-ME. Western blot analysis evaluating the total ISGylation pattern further confirmed this alternative activation pathway for AgmISG15 (Figure 7b for the experiment in HekT cells, Figure 7c in COS cells). The cells were transfected with combinations of an empty vector or vectors encoding HuUbE1L, HuUbE1 and UbcH8 together with FLAG-tagged HuISG15, AgmISG15 or MoISG15. Visualising the ISGylation pattern on the different samples only observed significantly enhanced ISGylation by Hu and MoISG15 upon ectopic expression of UbE1L. A beneficial effect on Hu/MoISGylation efficiency upon ectopic expression of UbE1 was minimal. By contrast, even with the higher basal ISGylation level of AgmISG15, overexpression of both UbE1L and UbE1 were able to further markedly enhance its conjugation capacity.",

            "text": "This variability in ISG15 sequence may indicate a redundant function of ISG15. Alternatively, it could point towards a role for ISG15 in the immune system, since high interspecies sequence divergence is very often associated with genes involved in host defense. Organism-specific niche occupation may lead to distinct repertories of invading pathogens causing species-specific pressures for adaptation of the host immune system [41], [42]. This increased evolutionary rate in immune genes may be further enhanced by the high mutation rates of the pathogens [43]. In line with the assignment of a specific role for ISG15 in host defense, naturally occurring loss-of-function ISG15 mutants have not yet been observed sofar, whereas a duplication of the ISG15 gene has been seen in crucian carp [44]. Although the precise function of ISG15 remains enigmatic, several lines of evidence point to its role as an antiviral agent. ISG15 is one of the most prominently induced genes upon type I IFN treatment, and several viruses such as Influenza B and SARS have developed mechanisms to counteract ISG15 function [9], [20]. ISG15 was also found to be critical for the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV replication and release [25]. Moreover, although ISG15 knock-out mice were initially found to be as vulnerable to viral infections as their wild type countermates [45], a subsequent study discovered ISG15 knock-out mice to be more vulnerable to Influenza, Herpes and Sindbis viral infection [24].",

In human cells, protein modification by ISG15 of OWm greatly outperforms that of Hu and MoISG15. Mutation of the residues in HuISG15 to the corresponding residues in the OWm orthologue mapped amino acid 89 as a critical residue for ISGylation. The occurrence of an acidic residue (preferably an Asp in human cells and Glu in mouse cells) at this position greatly enhances its ISGylation capacity. The Asp residue at position 89 in OWmISG15 also occurs in sheep and cows. In rodents and fish, this residue is a Glu residue. The incidence of the unfavorable Asn residue at position 89 for ISG15 modification in HuISG15 is also found in chimpanzee and dog ISG15. However, notwithstanding the greatly enhanced ISGylation capacity by mutation of the single Asn 89 residue in HuISG15 to an Asp residue, the overall ISGylation pattern in human HekT cells was still intermediary compared to AgmISG15. Additional mutations were created in the HuISG15 N89D mutant. Mutation of D133N and QIT31-33KIA further increased its ISGylation capacity. The triple HuISG15 mutant N89D D133N QIT31-33KIA proved to be as effective as AgmISG15 in conjugating target proteins in HekT cells. The use of this hyperefficient ISG15 variant may help to unravel the physiological function of ISG15.",

            "text": "Based on interaction interfaces of Nedd8 bound to AppBp1-Uba3 [36], Narasimhan and colleagues predicted 7 hot spot residues on ISG15 constituting the interface with UbE1L. Three of these residues show a high degree of conservation among the different Ub(L)s (i.e. R92, E132 & R153 in ISG15), 4 other residues are presumed to confine specificity for UbE1L (R87, K90, W123 & F149) [35]. We built a similar homology model for the UbE1L, using the crystal structures of the AppBp1-Uba3-Nedd8-ATP complex. Structure superposition shows that residue 89 corresponds to L8 in Nedd8 (Figure 6a), a well-conserved residue that is also found in Ub (Figure 1). Mutation of L8 in Ub significantly reduced its target conjugation ability [47], and in yeast this residue proved to be essential for viability [48]. This suggests that residue 89 in ISG15 and L8 in Ub have a similar important role in conjugate formation. L8 in Nedd8 is part of a hydrophobic patch (L8, I44, V70) that interacts with V323 and Y331 of Uba3, embedded in the two \u03b2-sheets preceding its C-terminal domain. Mutation of these residues greatly reduced Nedd8 adenylation and consequently conjugation [36]. However, residues L8, I44 and V70 in Nedd8 correspond with the non-hydrophobic residues N89, T125 and N151 in ISG15, suggesting different types of interaction in this region. The two Uba3 \u03b2-strands correspond to the region 880\u2013895 in the UbE1L model, but the alignment in this region is too poor to allow reliable modeling of the actual interactions. Moreover, residues 152-LRL-154, which are part of the C-terminal region of ISG15 juxtapose to N89 (Figure 4). This region aligns with 71-LRL-73 in Ub which was described to be of high importance for UbE1 binding affinity and for substrate specificity [49]. Our model suggests that residue 89 makes a contact with R565 in OWmUbE1L, which lies in the N-terminal domain, known to select for a specific UbL [36], [37]. In HuUbE1L, this Arg is replaced by a Trp. Strikingly, the sequence 560-GTLGTRG-566 in OWmUbE1L is very similar to the corresponding region 602-GTLGTKG-608 in HuUbE1 (see also Figure 6b). Based upon this observation, we experimentally demonstrated that HuUbE1 could efficiently activate AgmISG15, in contrast to Hu and MoISG15. This non-redundant role for UbE1L in activating MoISG15 is also in line with the loss of MoISG15 conjugation in UbE1L knock-out mice [50]. Unlike UbE1L, which is IFN-inducible and has a tissue and cell-line specific expression profile [51], UbE1 is ubiquitously expressed. Taken together, our findings support a role for residue 89 in ISG15 as a hot spot residue in the interface with its Activating enzyme, thus providing an explanation for the hyperISGylation seen for OWmISG15. Recently, with the discovery of UbE1L2 (Uba6) as the Activating enzyme for FAT10 and as a second Activating enzyme for Ub [7], [8], the theory of an Activating enzyme harboring unilateral assignment for a specific Ub(L) was overthrown. Here, we describe promiscuity of UbE1 for OWmISG15 activation. This is the first report of ISG15 being activated by another Activating enzyme than UbE1L. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is also the first report of an UbL -other than Ubiquitin- being activated by UbE1.",

            "text": "In contrast, homology modeling and structural superpositions do not predict a direct role for residue D133 or residues QIT31-33 of ISG15 in the activation step (Figure 4 and 6a). The D133 residue is part of a ridge of negatively charged residues along the ISG15 molecule [35]. The function of this ridge is unclear. D133 in HuISG15 corresponds to a negatively charged residue in Ub, SUMO, Nedd8, RUB1, Apg12 (all Asp residues) and Urm1 (occupied by a Glu residue). Models based on the AppBp1-Uba3-Nedd8-ATP complex or the Sae1-Sae2-SUMO-Mg-ATP complex, do not predict direct contact of residue 133 in ISG15 with Ube1L. The same hold true for residues 31\u201333. This suggests that mutations at position 31\u201333 and 133 influence total ISGylation by a different mechanism than mutation at position 89. This must occur later in the ISGylation process, since no effect of these mutations can be observed in the absence of the N89D mutation. Of note, notwithstanding their position on different Ub domains in ISG15, residues 31, 33 and 133 are situated at the same face of the molecule (see Figure 4) close to the electronegative ridge. As the total protein ISGylation results from the balance between conjugation and de-conjugation, mutation of QIT31-33 to KIA and D133 to N in HuISG15 N89D conceivably could affect recognition or activity by (a) discriminate DUB(s), retaining the targeted protein in the ISGylated state. In line with this hypothesis, a role has been described for the N-terminal Ub fold of ISG15 in the efficiency of DUB recognition/activity of the SARS coronavirus papain-like protease [52].",

UbcH10 (UbE2C) acts as an UbcH for the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC), promoting cyclinA degradation and mitotic exit. During the G1 phase, UbcH10 is auto-ubiquitinated allowing re-accumulation of cyclinA and entry in the S phase [53]. UbcH10 is often referred to as the cancer-related UbcH as it is markedly overexpressed in the majority of cancerous cell lines [54]. Recently, also UbcH16 (E2-25K or HIP2) has been identified as an APC-dependent UbcH promoting Ub K48-linked chain extensions on pre-attached Ubs [55]. UbcH17 (UbE2T) has recently been identified as the UbcH essential to ubiquinate FANCD2, which needs to be ubiquitinated in order to bind BRCA2 and take part in the DNA repair process. UbcH17-depleted cells have abnormal chromosomes, characteristic for Fanconi anemia [56], [57]. These findings may help explain the role for ISG15 in anti-tumor defense.",

HekT cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding the indicated FLAG-tagged HuISG15 variants (indicated with asterisk) each holding one amino acid substitution, FLAG-tagged wt Hu- or AgmISG15. Total cell lysates were prepared in a buffer with reducing agentia. The conjugation competence of the different ISG15 proteins is exposed by their FLAG-tag.

The other residues of ISG15 with an important effect on total ISGylation, situated at positions 133 (yellow) and 31\u201333 (cyan blue), do not make contact with UbE1L and are likely to be involved in another feature of the ISGylation process.

The samples were divided in two aliquots; and were subjected to SDS-PAGE under non-reducing or reducing conditions. The proteins were stained with IRDye Blue protein stain and visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system. The extra band representing thiolester formation between UbE1 and AgmISG15 is flanked by two asterisks. These thiolester bonds are disrupted by the addition of reducing agent (here \u03b2-ME).
