            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are highly contagious pathogens that are associated with a wide spectrum of human illnesses involving the respiratory, ocular, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems [1]. They belong to the family Adenoviridae, genus Mastadenovirus with seven species (A-G), including each various types [2]. Ubiquitous in the environment, HAdVs are non-enveloped, double stranded DNA viruses that vary in size from 70 to 100 nm [3]. HAdVs are recognized as a common cause of respiratory infection in persons of all ages. The illnesses range from influenza-like fever and discomfort to pneumonia and death [4]. Indeed, HAdVs infections are usely mild but some groups such as very young children, elderly, immunocompromised persons, or persons with underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease, might be at higher risk degree for severe disease [5,6,7,8]. The most common HAdVs species that cause respiratory tract infections in children are B (HAdV-B3 and B7) and C (HAdV-C1, C2, and C5). Serotypes B3, B7, and B21 are the most frequent strains responsible for epidemics of acute febrile respiratory disease [9]. Circulating HAdVs can vary temporally and geographically with possibility of emergent genomic variants which can be associated with more severe illness [10,11].",

An ILI patient was defined as a person presenting with sudden onset of fever (>38\u00b0C) or history of sudden onset of fever in the recent past (\u2264 3 days) and either cough or sore throat and/or rhinorrhea in the absence of other diagnosis, according to the CDC case definition. Each sample is accompanied by a case report form collecting demographic and clinical data. The questions included information on date of enrollment and symptom onset, sex, age, clinical symptoms, previous treatments, travelling history, vaccination status for influenza, and whether or not the patient was hospitalized. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the specimens were processed immediately for virus diagnosis.

The principles of the 4S network were approved by the Ministry of Health in its guidelines for influenza surveillance policy, finalized with the support of Pasteur Institute in Dakar and the Strengthening Influenza Sentinel Surveillance in Africa (SISA) project funded by the WHO. The protocol and oral consent were determined as routine surveillance activity, and therefore non-research by the Senegalese National Ethics committee and the steering committee for 4S network, an entity representing MoH, IPD, WHO and Clinicians in compliance with all applicable National regulations governing the protection of human subjects. Data were collected in an objective of surveillance and are anonymous. The information provided to participants was an informal description of the study. Respiratory specimens were collected, only after informed consent was granted, verbally, to local health care workers by the patients or parents in the case of minors. Oral consent was documented in the patient form with two questions about received information and about oral consent. Patients could refuse to participate, no specimen will be taken. For the surveillance activities, written consent is judged not necessary by the Senegalese national ethics committee, which has also previously approved the work of the National Influenza Center. Collections of non-sensitive data or an observation from normal care in which participants remain anonymous do not require ethics committee review. The patients included in this study were of all ages and consulted the sentinel sites due to influenza-like symptoms; the patients, or parents in the case of minors, accept the tests for respiratory viruses largely because they are free and safe.",

This rate seems very higher in comparison with available data. Indeed, much lower rates are reported in similar other studies conducted in other countries. A study conducted in Kenya [16] on refugees from different countries (Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya) yielded a detection rate of 21.7%, in Gabon Douki et al [17] detected HAdV in 16.3% of outpatients with ILI. These detection rates are still lower in other geographical regions: South Korea with 10.1% or 0.6% [18,19], China with 2.7% or 6.3% [20,21], Philippines with 0.9% [22], Malaysia less than 2% [23], USA with 5.7% or 2.8% reported [24,25], Canada in the Ontario Provence with 0.9% [26], Peru with 6.2% [27], Venezuela with 1.6% [28], England with 6.6% [29]. The analysis of these data tends to confirm a higher prevalence of adenoviruses in the respiratory sphere in African populations. This trend was largely confirmed when we investigated the importance of HAdV in children with acute respiratory infections. Indeed we observed that proportions in Cameroon (27.3%) [30] and Senegal (29.2%) (Fall et al, on submission) were considerably higher than those found in other geographical areas: Nascimento-Carvalho et al., [31] in Brazil with 3%, Moe et al., [32] in Norway (1.7%), Wansaula et al., [33] in USA (1%) or Lu et al., [34] in China.",

The most frequently co-detected viruses were influenza viruses (53.1%), rhinoviruses (30%), enteroviruses (18.5%) and RSV (13.5%). However, we noted no significant differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between patients with single HAdV infection and those co-infected. The same observation was reported in studies conducted in diverse geographical contexts [27,41]. A previous study conducted in Chilean children stated that the clinical severity in patients with single HAdV infection and those with mixed infections was the same [47]. The overall finding is that the clinical value of such co-infections is not clear and still requires independent investigations in order to assess the association between co-infection and severe illness or symptoms.",

HAdV-B species from Senegal clustered with genome types HAdV-7, HAdV-7d, HAdV-55 and HAdV-11 (88% bootstrap value). HAdV-7d serotype, firstly identified in 1980 in Beijing [59], is of particular concern as it was often associated with illnesses presenting with more severe and higher levels of morbidity than other respiratory HAdV pathogens, and also may result in higher levels of fatalities [60\u201362]. The HAdV-55 genome type, formerly known as HAdV-11a, is a genotype resulting from recombination between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 [63]. The serotype has recently reemerged as a highly virulent pathogen, causing severe [64] and sometimes fatal pneumonia among immunocompetent adults, particularly in Asia [65\u201367]. So the circulation of such HAdV genome types in Senegal emphasizes the need to reinforce HAdV surveillance, especially in hospitalized patients, by including HAdV genome detection and genotyping in the documentation of severe respiratory infections.",

So the sequencing results do not reflect the full spectrum of HAdV strains that may be circulating in ILI patients in Senegal, and even for selected samples it may have a bias toward samples with a high viral load. Another limitation concerned the molecular methods used for typing HAdVs in this study, a method which targeted a short hexon hypervariable region that has been shown to correlate closely with serotype. This method does not provide genomic detail and might miss recombination events located in other regions of the genome. Therefore, full-genome sequencing would be more informative on Senegalese strains, especially for HAdV-B7 and HAdV-B55 types. The results of this study should also be interpreted with caution especially for HAdV ILI causality (carriage in healthy or asymptomatic individuals).",

The circulation of though HAdV-7d and HAdV-55 genome types is of note as these serotypes are recognized causes of more severe and even fatal acute respiratory infections. So in the interest of global public health we strongly suggest molecular surveillance and genotyping of newly detected HAdV strains in Senegal and even by whole genome sequencing for some especial strains. Our study offers also an important perspective on the burden of adenovirus-associated respiratory illness in Senegal. Such a perspective, especially among children, should include asymptomatic controls, SARI cases, information on disease outcome, atypical clinical signs, duration of symptoms, and treatment. Data regarding viral load, shedding, and other possible etiologies (e.g., bacterial and other viruses) would also enable a more thorough assessment of the viral effective disease (or symptom) causality.",
