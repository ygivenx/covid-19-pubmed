In addition, AMs encompass a self-renewal ability, which maintains the characteristics of existing AMs and embraces alveolar characteristics [7]. The CMs from bone marrow helps restore the number of AMs when the population decreases due to severe infection or radiotherapy, etc. [8]. The specific characteristics of AMs implies that CM-based studies are not applicable to AMs. Hence, using AMs such as 3D4/31, are more appropriate to study pulmonary health and immunity.",

            "text": "Previously, classical M1 macrophages were closely associated with the glycolysis pathway, which is a key regulator of macrophage activation. However, recent studies on M2-like macrophages such as AMs report that lipid metabolism plays an important role in macrophage differentiation and activation of the M2 form. Two basic lipid metabolisms (fatty acid synthesis [FAS] and fatty acid oxidation [FAO]) are known to work centrally [9]. The FAS pathway can be summarized as follows: carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), and the production of palmitic acid (most basic fatty acids found in mammals) from malonyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase (FASN) [10]. Using these or externally absorbed lipids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced through the FAO and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The FAO pathway functions by converting fatty-acyl-CoA to acyl-CoA by the action of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), subsequent to beta-oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix by several enzymes include acetyl-CoA acyltransferase (ACAA), and finally production of acetyl-CoA by \u03b2-oxidation, and involvement in the TCA-cycle for generating ATP [11].",

Enhanced steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC3) signaling promotes the metastasis of lung cancer and myeloma cells, which are known to be fatal in patients [12,13]. However, SRC3 plays an essential role in lipid metabolism and macrophage survival, by initiating FAO and preventing excessive fatty acid accumulation by reacting sensitively to fatty acid concentration [14]. Moreover, SRC3 signaling is activated by infection, thereby increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes (catalase) and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell death, and improve bacterial clearance [15].

Since the research on the medical efficacy of plants has been continuously carried out and most of the plants have been studied, there is a growing demand for new plant species that have not been studied previously. The succulent plant, represented by aloe, is inhabited in unique environments such as desert, tropical regions, and coasts with high salinity, and has undergone relatively less research than other plant species [17]. Nevertheless, a small number of succulent plants, such as aloe and prickly pear, have been successfully used for commercial purposes because of their proven efficacy in immunity [18,19]. For this study, we selected Dudleya brittonii (D. brittonii) from several succulent plant species by collecting various information about respiratory immunity. D. brittonii, also called giant chalk dudleya, is a succulent plant mainly found in California and Mexico, and is widely used for ornamental purposes [20]. Due to a dearth of biological studies on D. brittonii, the effect on cells or animals is yet to be elucidated. Interestingly, according to the University of San Diego, Kumeyaay, a native American in California, used D. brittonii for treating asthma, an inflammatory airway obstruction disease closely associated with macrophages. Therefore, in this study, we attempt to verify the survival and metabolic efficacy of D. brittonii extract (DB) in AMs.",

We observed that DB does not induce any significant change in the cell cycle either by applying single treatment or co-treatment with PMA, in 3D4/31 macrophages. However, the dead cells population was increased 2-fold as compared to the vehicle when DB was co-treated with PMA; furthermore, exposure to DB also reduces the number of dead cells as compared to the vehicle only treated cells (Figure 2A, 2B; p<0.05). These results demonstrate that DB reduces the cell death in activated macrophages, and provides evidence of enhanced cell survival effect after DB exposure. We simultaneously confirmed the effects of DB on ROS production (12 h after treatment with DB and/or PMA). DCFDA, a plasma membrane permeable molecule and sensitive indicator of ROS, was applied for the investigation. We observed intracellular reduction of ROS levels (20.93%\u00b12.89%) in 3D4/31 macrophages after treatment with DB, as compared to vehicle treatment and PMA treatment (25.08%\u00b112.41% increase after PMA treatment).

For this assay, we measured the 27 gene expression levels in 3D4/31 macrophages after exposure to DB and/or PMA for 12 h. Treatment with DB alone resulted in decreased expression of glycolysis genes (glucose transporter 1 [GLUT1], hexokinase [HK] 2, HK3, phosphofructokinase platelet [PFKP], phosphofructokinase liver [PFKL], pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cells [PKLR], pyruvate kinase muscle [PKM]), and increased expression of FAO genes (long- chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [ACADL], acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1A [ACAA1], acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 [ACAA2], peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 [PPARA]) and TCA cycle genes (dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase [DLAT], citrate synthase [CTS], isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 alpha [IDH3], succinate thiokinase [SUCLG1], malate dehydrogenase [MDH] 1, MDH2), as compared to the vehicle (Figure 4A, 4B, and 4C, respectively; p<0.05).

Therefore, it is very important to keep the existing alveolar macrophage population healthy. Activation of AMs due to respiratory infections is a major threat to the AM population that exists from the time of birth; thus, the survival rate-enhancing efficacy of DB on activated AMs can be helpful for maintaining the respiratory health. AMs function even under normal conditions, even if there is no infection. Most functions of CMs are focused on the phagocytosis of the pathogen, but tissue-specific macrophages play an important role in maintaining homeostasis by removing apoptotic cells or cellular debris. Especially, AMs are closely related to inflammation and various diseases of the respiratory system. Pneumonia, Pasteurella multocida, foot-and-mouth disease virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, etc., cause great losses in the entire farmhouse because of their high infectivity [31\u201333]. Therefore, the survival rate enhancement effect of DB on AMs may help to prevent respiratory infectious diseases by improving the respiratory immunity of livestock. In addition, pneumonia is mainly caused by infections such as bacteria and viruses. In pigs, pneumonia easily caused by Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pasteurella multocida, etc., or complications [34]. Pig pneumonia has a high infection rate and spreads easily on the farms, which inhibit the porcine survival and growth, so proper treatment and prevention are important, but there is no proper treatment or prevention other than antibiotics. However, since the use of feed additive antibiotics is prohibited, a method of improving immunity to prevent pneumonia has been attempted. Since AMs play an important role in the control of pneumonia through anti-inflammatory and phagocytic actions, DB may be useful for the prevention of swine pneumonia [35,36].",

            "text": "Growth hormones and feed additive antibiotics have been used indiscriminately in an age when there is no regulation on livestock production, to promote the growth of livestock and prevent diseases. However, their use has been banned in most countries due to environmental pollution and residue of animal products [37]. As a result, due to the precise correlation between steroid (or antibiotics) and infectious diseases, the repercussion has been an increase in the incidence of diseases in livestock. Hence, the demand for newer methods has increased and is newly developed to replace steroid (or antibiotics) [38]. Currently, steroids can be used for the recovery from bacterial infections or lung diseases, but they have no direct effect on the removal of infections and have been reported to only play a role in helping recovery [39,40]. In this study, we observed increased survival rate of AMs with SRC3 expression, which is a steroid sensor. It has previously been reported that steroid treatment prevents livestock diseases, and lung infections are improved by steroid sensor stimulation such as SRC3 of AMs.",

            "text": "This study confirms that DB upregulates the FAS, FAO, and TCA cycle genes, as well as SRC3 mRNA expression and cell survival rate in 3D4/31 AMs. However, the reason for the increase in LDHA and the decrease in WST-1 cell viability due to DB treatment is difficult to explain. These irregular results are expected to be induced by anaerobic glycolysis [41] or antioxidant effect. WST-1 assay is based on the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase (M-DHase) [42], M-DHase carries out energy production through oxidative phosphorylation on mitochondria, which is the largest part of intracellular ROS production [43]. Therefore, if the antioxidant activity of DB is accompanied by the inhibition of M-DHase activity, it is expected that similar results can be obtained as a decrease of viability with the decrease of ROS. In addition, further research in respiratory immunity using small animals such as a mouse needs to be performed in vivo, before practical application to livestock. Despite these limitations, this study confirms a new mechanism for the association of lipid metabolism and survival enhancement in the porcine AMs, and suggests that administering DB could potentially improve the survival rate of AMs. This study provides new insights and directions for further research in the immunity of the porcine respiratory system based on AMs and natural materials.",
