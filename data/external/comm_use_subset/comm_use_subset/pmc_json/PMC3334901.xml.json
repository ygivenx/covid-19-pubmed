BALB/c mice were infected intravenously (i.v.) with sub-lethal doses of wild type Lm EGD-e (103), L.inn::vgc (107), or the wild type L.inn strain (107). Time points correlating with the critical phases of host immune response to listerial infection were selected and used to compare bacterial growth and induction of immune effectors in wild-type Lm, L.inn and L.inn::vgc strains. Day 3 of a Listeria infection refers to the end of the pre-immune phase before the expansion of specific T cells in the mouse model of listeriosis [14]. The presence of viable bacteria on this day has been shown to be critical for the successful induction of T cell-mediated immunity [15]. Therefore on day 3, bacterial load as well as spleen morphology was analyzed. Day 9 corresponds to the primary immune effector phase. At this time point, DTH to soluble antigen was measured in vivo as an indicator of DTH reaction and CD4+ T cell activity. Moreover, the numbers of antigen specific IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were analyzed. Day 60 post-infection as well as day 5 post-challenge were chosen to analyze the memory immune effector phase [16]. To this end the number of memory effector T- cells was determined quantitatively.",

L.inn::vgc and the wild type Lm showed significantly higher transcriptional induction of both IFN-a2 and IFN-b1 than wild type L.inn at 2 hours post-infection (Fig. 1B).

Spleen cells from mice immunized with L.inn::vgc produced significantly lower levels of IFN-gamma when compared to spleen cells from mice immunized with wild type Lm. The wild type L.inn strain failed to prime T cells for the production of IFN-gamma (Fig. S1, supplementary information).",

Both CD4+ (helper, MHC class II restricted) and CD8+ (cytotoxic, MHC class I restricted) T cell subpopulations have been implicated [20]. Experimental evidence indicates, however, that CD8+ T cells play the predominant role in mediating protective immunity [21]\u2013[24]. The ability of the recombinant L.inn::vgc to induce T-cell mediated immunity as a prerequisite for protective immunity was analyzed. Groups of BALB/c mice were infected with Lm (103), L.inn (107), or L.inn::vgc (107). Two months later, all mice were challenged with a lethal i.v. dose (105), corresponding to 20\u00d7LD50, of the wild type Lm, and survival was monitored. As controls, a group of untreated BALB/c mice that received a similar lethal dose of the wild type Lm were included. A single pre-immunization with the L.inn::vgc strain led to a significant protection against subsequent lethal infection with Lm. As expected, all mice that were pre-immunized with sub-lethal doses of Lm were also protected against a lethal listerial infection and survived whereas all non-immunized mice as well as those pre-immunized with L.inn died within 4 days after challenge (Fig. 4A).",

This number increased dramatically upon re-infection with the wild type Lm (2\u00d7103) in mice pre-immunized with Lm as well as with L.inn::vgc while pre-immunization with L.inn was not able to induce CD62L down-regulation seen in the other groups (Fig. 5).

To illustrate the proof of principle of this strategy we used the Listeria model by taking a non-pathogenic L.inn strain and complementing it with genes from pathogenic Lm which were previously shown to be a sine qua non requirement for intracellular growth and survival [18]. This novel vaccine strategy resulted in generation of a recombinant strain (L.inn::vgc) that possesses properties needed to induce the marked protective immunogenic properties of the wild type Lm but is attenuated in virulence as well as in its capacity to induce host detrimental cell-mediated inflammation. The recombinant L.inn::vgc strain showed a significant in vivo survival rate in the first 3 days post-infection (Fig. 1A). This observation is in accordance with our recent finding that the L.inn::vgc strain is able to survive in phagocytic host cells [18]. Moreover, it has the capability to induce identical Type I interferon at levels similar to wild type Lm. As previously shown by McAffrey et al., 2003, induction of type 1 IFN is a surrogate marker indicating access of Listeria into the cytosol of antigen presenting cells [17]. We have shown that the L.inn::vgc strain could use the complemented virulence factors to escape into the cytosol and subsequently be presented to CD8 T lymphocytes. In this context Zwaferink et al. 2008 have shown a role for IFNb in macrophage cell death. Treatment of macrophages with this cytokine could enhance host-cell membrane permeabilization by listeriolysin consequently leading to cell apoptosis [27].",

Morphological and histological analysis of spleen after infection with Lm have shown the induction of splenomegaly and granuloma as a result of monocytic infiltrations of the white pulp which were most pronounced on day 3 post-infection while infection with L.inn::vgc only resulted in a splenomegaly without any significant morphological changes detectable (Fig. 3A,3B). The intensity of the morphological and histological alterations in spleens paralleled the level of Listeria-induced DTH responses, as the in vivo induction of DTH after L.inn::vgc infection was also significantly lower than DTH induction following Lm infection (Fig. 3 and Fig. S1). We therefore show that the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain shows a significantly reduced proinflammatory and CD4+ mediated inflammatory response compared to Lm, thereby addressing one major concern regarding the use of live Lm as a vaccine.",

Previous experimental studies [30], [31] have revealed that persistence and number of viable microorganisms are important parameters for establishing efficient T cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, it has been shown that the presence of live bacteria in mice organs over the first 48 hours after immunization is critical for the induction of effector CD8+ T cell mechanisms [32]. Indeed we were able to show that all animals immunized with Lm or L.inn::vgc were protected against 20\u00d7LD50 of virulent Listeria (Fig. 4A). Although the L.inn::vgc strain elicits lowered CD4+ mediated inflammatory responses as compared to infection with Lm, it is capable of mounting a successful anti-listerial protective response, indicating that the observed in vivo survival pattern of the L.inn::vgc strain was sufficient to induce protection.",

It was previously reported that primary infection with the wild type Lm induces down regulation of CD62L on the surface of effector CD8+ T cells which reaches its lowest levels at day 8 post-infection [34]. However, over the following weeks, expression of CD62L is up regulated. During recall infection, CD62L is then rapidly down regulated on the surface of memory CD8+ T cells [32], [35]. In order to correlate protection against challenge with Listeria with antigen specific CD8+ T cells, we examined the induction of LLO91\u201399 specific CD8+ T cells in response to primary infection with the different Listeria strains. Infection with L.inn::vgc induced a significant population of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 4B) which, upon challenge with the wild type Lm, showed a CD62L expression pattern similar to that presented in mice primarily infected with the wild type Lm (Fig. 5). The identity of the memory T-cells induced in response to L.inn::vgc infection was confirmed by testing the CD44 expression on the CD8+ T-cells following recall infection with Lm where high expression of CD44 was observed on CD8+ T-cells derived from mice primarily infected with the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain but not with the wild type L.inn (Fig. S3). The inability of the Lm strain lacking listeriolysin O (LLO) [36] as well as the L.inn strain expressing only LLO [37] to induce a protective T cell response reflects the requirement of the entire virulence gene cluster in conferring a long lasting immunity. We therefore show that a non-pathogenic L.inn strain complemented with the entire vgc is capable of inducing a vigorous anti-listerial response.",

Using the intraperitoneal route of infection, we obtained a similar result i.e. protection following pre-infection with the Lm and L. inn::vgc strains but not with mice pre-immunized with the L. inn strain (Fig. S2). Thus despite a different route of infection Lm::vgc is able to induce protection in-vivo. The mouse is not a suitable and reproducible model for evaluating oral immunization protocols because of the specificity of the listerial InlA molecule [38]. Therefore experiments examining mucosal immunity will have to be carried out in the guinea pig model of listerial infection.",

These properties, imparting protective responses and rapid elimination from the host are considered to be desirable properties for successful vaccine vectors. Our results, namely, the in vivo survival pattern, the induction of interferon's and antigen specific CD8+ T cells, the lack of overt detrimental inflammatory reactions and most importantly the induction of protection against challenge with Listeria, allow the conclusion that the L.inn::vgc strain is potentially capable of inducing protection and that further development of this strain as a suitable live bacterial vaccine vector in clinical settings are warranted.",
