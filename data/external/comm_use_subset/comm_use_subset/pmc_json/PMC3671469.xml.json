            "text": "With approximately 243 million cases and more than 800,000 deaths reported in 2009, malaria remains the most important human parasitic disease. Among the five Plasmodium species able to infect human, P. falciparum is responsible for most cases of severe disease and death, mainly in African children below the age of five. The morbidity caused by P. vivax in tropical countries outside of Africa has long been underestimated (Anstey et al., 2009, Baird, 2009). Malaria is a factor of poverty in endemic countries (Stratton et al., 2008). In the absence of an effective vaccine and reliable approaches for vector control, chemotherapy remains the corner stone of malaria control. Quinine has been the first widely used antimalarial drug. Synthetic derivatives of quinine were the 8-aminoquinoline primaquine and the 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine (CQ). When resistance to CQ emerged in the late 1950 s, the strategy was to modify the chemical structure of the existing compounds. The synthesis of CQ-like drugs led to the discovery of amodiaquine (AQ) and later mefloquine (MQ), halofantrine in the United States and lumefantrine in China (Baird, 2005). But the pace of new drug development has been slow and no new antimalarial drugs have been introduced into clinical practice since artemether-lumefantrine registered in 1998 (Olliaro & Wells, 2009). For all new antimalarial drugs introduced the risk of resistance can be reduced by combination therapy (White, 1999; Nosten & White, 2007). In 2006, the WHO guidelines recommended new treatments combining two drugs with different mechanisms of action. Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs) are now standard treatment for falciparum malaria. However, a decline of susceptibility to artesunate has been recently reported in the Thai- Cambodian border region (Dondorp et al., 2010). So the search for new molecules with antimalarial activity is more important than ever.",

These strategies include ethnopharmacology (i.e. bio-evaluation of the efficiency of traditional medicines), medicinal chemistry, combinatorial chemistry and chemical libraries screening by high throughput screening, and drug design. These strategies have led to the discovery of potential antimalarials such as the synthetic endoperoxides and others (Dhanawat et al., 2009). But the clinical development of new compounds is often been stopped for various reasons: toxicity, chemistry, pharmacology, or economics, and less than one in ten promising molecules that have entered the pipeline reaches the stage of clinical studies. In the mid- 90 s, we extended the strategy developed by G\u00e9rard Jaouen (Vessieres et al., 1988) in anticancer therapy to antimalarial therapy (see Chavain & Biot, 2010 for review). The main antimalarials in current use (CQ, quinine, mefloquine, artemisinin, atovaquone) were modified by introduction of a ferrocenyl moiety in their chemical structure. More than 150 ferrocenic analogues have been synthesized, by us and others (Biot & Dive, 2010). The ferrocenic analogues were systematically tested against in vitro cultures of P. falciparum with CQ-susceptible and CQ-resistant strains. Ferroquine (FQ, SSR97193) was rapidly identified as a lead compound to meet candidate nomination requirements (Biot et al., 1997). The clinical phase IIb study (efficacy/safety in adults, adolescents and children) began in 2009 in Africa.",

New sandwiches and half-sandwiches metal complexes (Dunitz et al., 1956) have been synthesized and characterized. In vitro tests of their antimalarial activity were performed.

In the ferrocene-CQ hybrids series, we have shown that the ferrocene moiety has to be covalently flanked by a 4-aminoquinoline and an alkylamine (Biot et al., 2006). Ferroquine (FQ, SSR97193) was the first compound synthesized by us (Biot et al., 1997). Later, a second generation of analogues of FQ was designed and investigated. For example, we synthesized dual molecules including a FQ analogue conjugated with a glutathione reductase inhibitor or a glutathione depletory (Chavain et al., 2009) Nevertheless, this strategy failed to identify a \u201cnew\u201d lead for a further development. More interestingly, amino-alcohols based on the FQ structure are active against CQ-susceptible (CQS) and CQ-resistant (CQR) clones of P. falciparum. In addition, in this second generation of analogues the ferrocenic amino-alcohols exert antiviral effects with some selectivity toward SARS-CoV infection (Biot et al., 2006b).",

But the curative tests are more significant and showed that P. berghei and P. vinckei infections were cured in presence of 8.3 mg/kg/d of FQ for four days when with CQ 30 to 55 mg/kg/d were necessary to cure CQS strains and the drug was unable to cure resistant strains, even at a toxic dose (Biot et al., 1997, Delhaes et al., 2001, Dive & Biot, 2008, Biot & Dive, 2010).

In vitro FQ is mainly metabolized to a major N-monodemethylated metabolite, SSR97213 (EVT0233) and to a further potential metabolite that is an N-didemethylated compound. Antimalarial activity of N-monodemethyl-FQ was found to be comparable to that of parent compounds on two CQS clones and remained much more active than CQ on two CQR clones. On the another hand, N-didemethyl-FQ had a decreased activity on CQR clones, mainly if IC90 of compounds is taken into account (Daher, et al., 2006a).",

            "text": "In addition, in the study from Thailand the main FQ in vivo metabolite (SSR97213) was investigated (Barends et al., 2007). SSR97213 was shown to be highly potent against P. falciparum (N = 64, IC50 = 37 nM with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 34.3 to 39.9 nM, or IC50 = 16.0 ng/mL with 95% CIs = 14.9 to 17.3 ng/mL) on all the clinical isolates. To investigate whether P. vivax was sensitive to FQ a study was conducted in northwestern Thailand on 63 isolates collected from October 2006 to April 2009 to examine the effects of FQ and its demethylated metabolite (SSR97213) on the ring stage and the schizont maturation by microscopy. All samples were collected from patients with acute P. vivax who had mono-species parasitaemia of > 100/500 white blood cells. FQ was found to have a potent ex vivo effect on P. vivax schizont maturation (median IC50 = 15 nM; 75% CIs = 12 to 20 nM, n = 52) with SSR97213 being less active (IC50 = 77 nM; 75% CIs = 14 to 205 nM), and no significant cross-sensitivity between FQ and other antimalarials was detected; consequently FQ may be a suitable replacement for chloroquine in the treatment of drug-resistant P. vivax malaria (Leimanis et al., 2010). In the Gabonese study (Kreidenweiss et al., 2006), IC99 s were reported in comparison with IC50 s (Kreidenweiss et al., 2006). For artesunate and FQ, the IC99 s were 5.76 nM (95% CIs = 0.57 to 49.1 nM) or IC50 = 2.21 ng/mL (95% CIs = 0.22 to 18.9 ng/mL), and 5.75 nM (95% CIs = 1.10 to 56.9 nM) or IC50 = 2.50 ng/mL (95% CIs = 0.48 to 24.8 ng/mL). These values are close to the reported IC50 s, indicating a strong potency and the ability to efficiently kill all parasites present in the field isolates. Finally, the susceptibility of P. falciparum isolates from Madagascar (n = 21), Guyana (n = 65) and Cambodia (n = 62) to FQ was measured at the local Pasteur Institutes using the [3H]-hypoxanthine incorporation method. The mean IC50 (with minimum and maximum IC50 values), were 5.96 nM (0.2-43.2), 8.68 nM (3.05- 55.77) and 10.18 nM (2.53-43.43), respectively (Eric Legrand, personal communication).",

The in vitro assays emphasized the specific importance of the intra-molecular hydrogen bond in FQ. Indeed in our studies based on methyl- FQ (an analogue of FQ without the intra-molecular hydrogen bond due to the presence of a methyl group on the 4-amino group), we clearly showed that the presence of the intra-molecular hydrogen bond allows FQ to escape resistance mechanisms and avoid crossresistance with the current antimalarials (Biot et al., 2009; Dubar et al., 2011).",

Ongoing phase IIb dose-range study accounting for 440 patients conducted across seven African countries is currently assessing in four groups the safety and efficacy of an association of FQ-at a three dose level- with artesunate and FQ alone in patients with mono infection with P. falciparum.

One remaining question is the cause of the potent activity of the drug, mainly towards CQ resistant parasites, and its relation with the structure of the molecule. Some clues (role of the hydrogen bond, role of redox activity, nature of the metal present in the metallocene moiety) are currently under examination to clarify the mechanisms of entry of FQ in the infected red blood cell, its site and mechanism of action and its relation with the transporters involved in resistance against different aminoquinolines, which appear ineffective to expel the molecule out of the parasite. On the clinical front, it remains to determine how this new drug will be best combined with a partner to limit the risk of resistance.",
