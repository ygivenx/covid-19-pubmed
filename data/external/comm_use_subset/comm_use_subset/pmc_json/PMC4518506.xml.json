The low response rate and side effects associated with IFNs mean that nucleos(t)ide analogs are used most often. Nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibit the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity of the HBV DNA polymerase (P), thereby interrupting the elongation of newly synthesized DNA. The drugs also lower alanine aminotransferase levels, reduce serum HBV DNA levels, and induce seroconversion of HBV e antigen (HBeAg) to anti-HBe in CHB patients.",

            "text": "LMV was the first nucleoside analog to be licensed (in 1998); however, 80 % of patients become resistant after 5 years of therapy [5-8]. The most common mutation associated with LMV resistance is the substitution of methionine 204 with isoleucine, valine, or serine (M204I/V/S) at the YMDD active site motif within the P protein RT domain [9\u201311]. The L80V/I mutation was first detected in patients with severe hepatitis after apparent LMV failure [12]. Mutation at the L180 or A181 residues also contributes to LMV resistance [13]. M204V/I mutations associated with LMV and LdT resistance also confer cross-resistance to other L-nucleosides and reduce sensitivity to ETV (but not to ADV or TDF) [10, 13\u201317]. ADV-resistance also becomes a limiting factor for treatment, although it develops more slowly than resistance to LMV [18]. Like ADV, TDF (a methyl derivative of ADV) exhibits antiviral activity against LMV-resistant HBV [19], although it is more potent than ADV and the rate of emergence of resistant mutants is slower. However, high doses of TDF and ADV cause nephrotoxicity in CHB patients [8]. Also, because nucleos(t)ide analogs do not prevent the initial formation of covalently closed circular DNA, new cells can be infected during therapy due to the persistent viremia [20].",

M204V or M204I are the most frequently observed mutations in this region, and confer resistance to LMV, LdT, and ETV [16, 17]. A less frequently observed mutation following LMV treatment is M204S, although additional mutations can be found in different RT regions [11]. To investigate the inhibitory effect of Phyllanthus extract on LMV-resistant mutants, we substituted methionine 204 with alanine, isoleucine, lysine, leucine, arginine, serine, threonine, or valine to generate YADD, YIDD, YKDD, YLDD, YRDD, YSDD, YTDD, or YVDD, respectively (Fig. 3a). We then examined the replication of these mutants by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 3b, top panel). Single-stranded (SS), DL, and partially double-stranded relaxed circular (RC) HBV DNA molecules were detected in HBV WT- or mutant-transfected cells, albeit with different replication efficiencies (Fig. 3b, top panel). The transfection efficiency was normalized against luciferase expression (Fig. 3b, third panel). The amount of HBV DL DNA isolated from YIDD-, YLDD-, YSDD-, and YVDD-transfected cells was 105.8, 107.7, 94.2, and 92.4 %, respectively, of that isolated from HBV WT (Fig. 3b, top and bottom panels). However, the amount of HBV DL DNA in YADD-transfected cells was 55.3 % of that in HBV WT. HBV DNA synthesis was very inefficient in YKDD-, YRDD-, and YTDD-transfected cells, with HBV DL DNA levels being 21.3, 27.6, and 16.2 % of that in the HBV WT-transfected cells (Fig. 3b, top and bottom panels). Core particles were formed at comparable levels in mutant- and WT-transfected cells (Fig. 3b, 2nd panel).",

Overlap of the HBs open reading frame (ORF) with the P gene leads to an alteration in two amino acids (Ile195 and Trp196) in all mutants (except YLDD); this change is likely to affect HBsAg secretion. In agreement with a previous report [9], we observed reduced HBsAg secretion in cells transfected with YADD, YKDD, or YTDD (Fig. 3c). The level of HBsAg secretion from YSDD-transfected cells was low because the YSDD mutant harbored an ATT CGG sequence in the HBs ORF, which codes Ile195 and Arg196 (the same as the HBs-negative YKDD and YTDD mutants) (Fig. 3c). It should be noted here that the YSDD mutation identified in a LMV-resistant patient harbored AGT, coding for Ile195 and Val196 in the HBs ORF, and was HBsAg positive [11], whereas our constructed mutant harbored TCG. In contrast to a previous report [9], we found that the YRDD mutant secreted a very low level of HBsAg and replicated inefficiently (Fig. 3c). With the exception of the YTDD mutant, HBcAg secretion by the mutant viruses was comparable with that by HBV WT (Fig. 3c).",

Replicative intermediate HBV DNAs isolated from intracellular core particles were then analyzed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 4). Cells were treated with LMV (4 \u03bcg/mL) and ADV (27.3 \u03bcg/mL or 100 \u03bcM) as controls (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3). HBV DL DNA synthesis in LMV-, ADV-, and Phyllanthus extract-treated HBV WT-transfected HepG2 cells was 6.5, 15.5, and 17.9 % of that in untreated WT-transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 4a). Similarly, LMV, ADV, and Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis in YADD-, YKDD-, YRDD- and YTDD-transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 4b, d, f, and h). Consistent with previous reports, HBV DNA synthesis by YIDD and YVDD mutants was not inhibited by LMV treatment, confirming that these mutants were LMV-resistant (Fig. 4c and i, lanes 3). However, HBV DNA synthesis by the YIDD and YVDD mutants was inhibited by ADV and Phyllanthus extract (Fig. 4c and i, lanes 2 and 4). This, Phyllanthus extract maybe a useful treatment for LMV-resistant CHB patients. A previous study demonstrated that the YSDD variant was LMV-resistant [11]; however, we found that HBV DNA synthesis by the YSDD mutant was only marginally inhibited by LMV (34.5 % HBV DL DNA) (Fig. 4g, lane 3), indicating that an additional L180M mutation in the P gene [11] might confer LMV resistance. Nevertheless, ADV and Phyllanthus extract inhibited HBV DNA synthesis by the YSDD mutant more efficiently than LMV (Fig. 4g).",

            "text": "Medicines derived from plants inhibit viral production by inducing inflammatory responses and/or the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [46, 47]. Here, we observed increased expression of mRNA for COX-2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 (Fig. 5a). By contrast, there was no increase in the expression of mRNA for TNF-\u03b1, another pro-inflammatory cytokine (Fig. 5a). Although expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA increased in HBV WT-transfected/extract-treated cells, there was no change in the expression of mRNA for IFN-inducible genes such as OAS and PKR (Fig. 5b), suggesting that IFN may not exert antiviral activity via transcriptional upregulation of IFN-inducible genes in this HepG2-transfected cell system. The significant reduction in HBV replication and the increased expression of IL-6 and COX-2 in HBV WT-transfected/Phyllanthus extract-treated cells led us to hypothesize that upregulation of COX-2 and IL-6 mRNA occurs through transcriptional activation of innate immune signaling genes. We found that the expression of RIG-I, TLR-3, MyD88, and TRAF-6 mRNA increased in HBV WT-transfected/Phyllanthus extract-treated cells, but not in HBV WT-transfected cells or in cells treated with the extract alone (Fig 5c). This is suggestive of transcriptional activations of innate immune signaling genes. Also, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK and expression of COX-2 increased in HBV WT-transfected/extract-treated cells, but not in HBV WT-transfected cells or in cells treated with extract alone (Fig 5d). These results suggest that IL-6 upregulation in HBV-transfected/extract-treated HepG2 cells is mediated by both increased COX-2 expression (via ERK1/2 and JNK activation) and increased RIG-I, TLR-3, MyD88, and TRAF-6 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that Phyllanthus extract inhibits HBV replication in HepG2 cells by activating the innate immune response by triggering intracellular signaling cascades (e.g., the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways), leading to the induction of COX-2 and IL-6.",

Here, we demonstrated that Phyllanthus extract has antiviral activity against LMV-resistant HBV mutants (Fig. 4 and Table 1). We also showed that the antiviral activity of Phyllanthus extract was not due to inhibition of intracellular HBV RNA and C protein expression, core particle formation, or pgRNA encapsidation (Fig. 2). Therefore, to examine the mechanism underlying Phyllanthus-mediated inhibition of HBV DNA replication (Figs. 2 and 4), we analyzed the expression of intracellular signaling molecules. We found increased expression of TLR-3, RIG-I, TRAF-6, and MyD88, COX-2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b2 in HepG2 cells transfected with WT HBV and then exposed to Phyllanthus extract, but not in HBV WT-transfected HepG2 cells or in HepG2 cells exposed to extract alone (Fig. 5c). This suggests that the extract triggers the innate immune response and/or inflammatory responses, thereby inhibiting HBV replication.",

            "text": "Upregulated IFN-\u03b2 expression (Fig. 5b) suggests that Phyllanthus might induce IFN-mediated antiviral responses via IFN-inducible OAS and PKR genes. However, we did not observe OAS and PKR upregulation in HBV WT-transfected/extract-treated HepG2 cells (Fig. 5b). Since HepG2 cells harbor inherent defects in IFN-mediated antiviral responses [48], and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 only modestly inhibits HBV replication in HepG2 cells [49], it appears that IFN-mediated responses may not be the major mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of the extract. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other IFN-inducible cellular factors, such as apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalysis polypeptide 1-like 3G (APOBEC3G) or human cytidine deaminase may be involved in limiting HBV replication without affecting pgRNA packaging [50]. IFN-\u03b1-inducible expression of APOBEC3G has been reported in human hepatocytes, and IFN-responsive elements in the APOBEC3G promoter have been identified [50]. In addition, the DDX3 DEAD box (an RNA helicase) is involved in augmenting IFN-regulatory factor signaling by interacting with TANK-binding kinase 1/I\u03baB kinase \u03b5 [51]. Several studies demonstrate that cellular factors, such as APOBEC3G and DDX3, are incorporated into core particles and interact with HBV P protein, thereby inhibiting reverse transcription [52, 53].",

Unlike HBx over-expressed cells [55], we found that COX-2 expression was not increased in HBV WT-transfected cells (Fig. 5a and d, lanes 2). Since upregulated expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein was observed only in HBV WT-transfected/extract-treated HepG2 cells (Fig. 5a and d, lanes 3), expression of COX-2 and IL-6 may be triggered in HBV replicating cells in the presence of Phyllanthus extract. Upregulation of COX-2 expression via activation of the ERK1/2 and/or JNK pathways may play a role in the observed antiviral activity (Fig. 5d, lane 3). IL-6 regulates early HBV gene expression and inhibits HBV replication by activating the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways [58]. We speculate that increased IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, and COX-2 expression in HBV WT-transfected/Phyllanthus extract-treated HepG2 cells may induce the expression of IFN-inducible genes and/or different inflammatory mediators, which then inhibit HBV replication.",
