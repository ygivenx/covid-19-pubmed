            "text": "Literature stresses the importance of social factors in HIV/AIDS epidemics, and the potential impact of emerging biomedicine \u2018and its attendant opportunities and (perhaps unintended) social consequences\u2019 (Friedman, Kippax, Phaswana-Mafuya, Rossi, & Newman, 2006, p. 959). Although an extensive literature exists on progress toward visions of ultimate eradication (see Burman, Aphane, & Delobelle, 2016), challenges such as ongoing societal stigma (Gilbert, 2016), poor infrastructure and treatment delivery issues (Koto & Maharaj, 2016) and continued risk-taking behaviours (Ngidi, Moyo, Zulu, Adam, & Krishna, 2016) persist. This article makes the argument that certain recent developments in knowledge management enabled by technological advances offer hope for the ultimate eradication of HIV/AIDS, and offers insights into how these novel developments might contribute to this end. HIV/AIDS, however, is not alone among a host of global disease threats. Rapidly spreading antibiotic resistance heralds a post-antibiotic era (Gallagher, 2015), or antibiotic apocalypse (Ash, 1996); a world in which childbirth, even minor surgery, minor injuries and exposure to tuberculosis or other bacterial infections can be life-threatening. Similarly, climate change has been discussed in apocalyptic terms, or as a phenomena that, if not addressed, can result in large-scale loss of life (Feinberg & Willer, 2011), and HIV antiretroviral resistance (Herman, 2016) might also have catastrophic consequences if it follows the same trend as that associated with antibiotic resistance. Knowledge management has to date, however, failed to offer outright solutions to these problems. This paper argues, however, that in light of recent technological advances, knowledge management and social sciences theory development can now offer an important complement to the \u2018natural\u2019 sciences processes of scientific research, with important implications for research problem-solving.",

It is possible that given exposure to knowledge of threats on an \u2018apocalyptic\u2019 level, or potentially catastrophic global threats, individuals may deny or discount their existence, exhibiting decreased willingness to address them (Feinberg & Willer, 2011). There are other reasons for failure to address apocalyptic threats, and many other crises (not to mention global conflict) which might qualify for apocalyptic status, or have high potential human life costs. Whereas denial (Feinberg & Willer, 2011) might be one form of response to such imminent and serious threats, it is argued in this paper that another more useful response to these challenges is emerging, according to different literatures.",

The key characteristic of this body of literature can be described as a focus on dramatically increasing the global intensity of collaborations between problem-solvers. What is novel, or new, about these movements is that they share a common characteristic, namely arguments for the importance of social science theory as a complement to natural science methods of scientific research. Further, this literature suggests bottlenecks to innovative research capacity can also have their roots in human behaviour and systems of researchers.",

Certain of the highest cited papers and most influential academic books were first rejected by journal reviewers and editors, including Nobel Prize winning manuscripts in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology and Medicine, raising \u2018important questions about current publishing policies which govern the dissemination of new information\u2019 (Campanario, 2009, p. 558). In relation to the failure of Newtonian theory to integrate new theory development into its core, Lakatos (1970) argues that scientific progress can be constrained by the failure of theoretical frameworks to be responsive to new ideas, and that the structure of academic processes can hold back innovation.",

Further, \u2018critics often argue that peer review operates to regulate paradigmatic science (in the Kuhnian sense) rather than to welcome brand new knowledge\u2019 and there is therefore a \u2018real risk that evidence contrary to the established views can be suppressed or discarded\u2019 (Campanario, 2009, p. 559). Empirical research in certain instances has been found to be associated with biases (Henrion & Fischhoff, 1986), including \u2018file drawer bias\u2019 where studies failing to reject the null hypothesis literally remain in \u2018file drawers\u2019 (De Long & Lang, 1992) and serious concern has long existed across many scientific disciplines about the processes by which science is disseminated, in that theoretical innovation can be constrained by gatekeepers (Peters & Ceci, 1982). Notwithstanding bias in theory testing methods, dissemination of theory for fair criticism and contestation is perhaps a necessary condition for the progression of science.",

Mahoney (1977, p. 161) documents a \u2018tendency for humans to seek out, attend to, and sometime embellish experiences that support or \u201cconfirm\u201d their beliefs,\u2019 which has led to a bias against the dissemination of new perspectives, which is fundamentally at odds with Popper\u2019s (1972) notions of falsification, which require theoretical ideas to disseminate prior to their testing, or to provide opportunities for empirical falsification. Serious issues related to the resistance of academics themselves to scientific discovery Campanario (2009) seem to support Kuhn\u2019s (1962) and Lakatos\u2019s (1970) seminal arguments that constraints to scientific innovation can primarily have roots in human behaviour, and that social science has an important role in addressing these problems. Campanario (2009, pp. 550, 560) argues that the \u2018important topic of scientists\u2019 resistance to scientific discovery\u2019 is under-researched, as case studies show that \u2018scientists with something truly original to communicate often have to fight against the silence, the lack of interest, and as a result the absence of citations and recognition.\u2019",

It is argued in this paper that developing a stream of literature, or a field, explicitly focused on maximising human collaborations (as a dimension of knowledge management) could act as a counterpoint to the rapidly burgeoning field of big data and information management and enable a curative paradigm in health as well as more effective problem-solving in social science. This paper seeks to identify and link literature in support of this objective, and to make an argument that this literature may usefully be synthesised under the banner of an emerging field, namely probabilistic innovation, driven by a social movement toward the democratisation of knowledge (and therefore science, medicine and social science).",

An analogy might illustrate this challenge. If an airport could land and take off about a hundred aircraft in a day, exponentially increasing those landing would be akin to increasing problem-solving inputs using a crowdsourced R&D platform, and exponentially increasing those taking off to problem-solving outputs. Such an airport would then need to manage congestion in such a way to be able to land and take off hundreds of thousands of aircraft in a day. Posed this way, such a research problem might seem insoluble, at least at the scale discussed here. This research problem, however, if solved, holds the promise of radical innovations in socially important problem-solving. Solving cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, Ebola, antibiotic resistance, as well as a host of other problems might truly become a simple function of maximising problem-solving inputs, if these inputs could transmit to successful outputs.

The problem, however, is that unlike open-source software development, solutions become proprietary knowledge of the firm putting the problem on the site, and this knowledge is not released back into the crowd (Callaghan, 2014a). Arguably, this is one of the reasons why crowdsourced R&D has not delivered the successes open-source software development has, such as Android and Linux.

A primary limit to maximising scientific collaboration is congestion. Study of motor vehicle traffic flows might offer insights relevant also to Internet traffic in general, and more specifically for the management of maximised crowdsourced R&D inputs. Problems of traffic flows are well researched; two different literature camps have emerged over time, namely physicists, arguing spontaneous \u2018jams\u2019 occur, akin to the movement of water or particles, and engineers, including traffic engineers who conceptualise jams to be caused by obstacles, which can therefore be managed, or removed (Surowiecki, 2004). Traffic jam congestion has been the subject of simulation research (Munoz & Daganzo, 2002; Nagel, 1994), and a body of literature exists which might be usefully applied to crowdsourced R&D applications in contexts of congestion. Modelling high volume Internet traffic relationships might offer useful insights into how maximum inputs into crowdsourced R&D processes can be optimally managed. If circularity in the use of the crowd is attained, such as crowd funding used to support crowdsourced R&D (Callaghan, 2014b) the growth of the system might become financially sustainable, which may increase knowledge inputs at the cost of congestion.

In large-scale crowdsourced data collection and analysis seeking to facilitate real time research, crowdsourced R&D inputs would therefore need to be differentiated according to their relative value to ensure overall costs of congestion from crowdsourced inputs are linked to benefits.

The rise of collaborative knowledge systems such as Wikipedia which applies technological tools and managerial dynamics to structure and manage its content; such systems are sociotechnical systems that enable collaboration not only between humans but between humans and automated content agents (Niederer & van Dijck, 2010). Understanding the complex dynamics of a system which seeks to maximise knowledge flows and process them to maximise outflows may benefit from incorporating a systems analysis approach.

Maximised collaborations are therefore also constrained by the inherent characteristics of human researchers. Human systems, however, have also arisen in the form of organisations, institutions and networks which face host of other barriers which constrain collaborations, posing further challenges which are specific to crowdsourced R&D. An example of crowdsourced R&D in the medical field is Ekins and Williams\u2019s (2010, p. 393) vision of crowdsourced pharmaceutical research:Living in our connected world, pharmaceutical researchers can communicate in a variety of ways to leverage ideas from around the globe. These ideas do not have to come from within the walls of a single organisation. Taking this further: why limit access to just ideas? Open tools and data could feed an ecosystem. They could also breed a new class of researcher without affiliation, who has allegiance to neither company nor research organisation. They test their hypotheses with data from elsewhere, they do their experiments through a network of collaborations, they have no physical lab; while a shared cause may not be essential, confidentiality agreements and software may unite them as a loose cooperative.\n",

Notwithstanding challenges facing open modes of innovation, open mode applications of crowdsourced R&D to drug discovery is dramatically on the rise, according to Ekins and Williams (2010, p. 393/394):A recent example of the power of crowdsourcing is the availability of freely accessible online resources to enable and support drug discovery. For instance, online databases, including PubChem, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest on ChEBI database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/), DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca/), the Human Metabolome Database (www.hmbd.ca) and ChemSpider (http://www.chem.spider.com). These represent either government of privately funded initiatives with vastly differing resources and scopes \u2026 Sometimes, there are synergistic benefits of crowdsourcing; for example, the efforts behind the ChemSpider platform, originally a hobby project housed from a basement and recently acquired by the Royal Society of Chemistry, has been acknowledged to have greatly enriched the content in the NIH\u2019s PubChem.\n",

Conscious systems design might therefore be used to develop global connectivity that goes beyond social media, and model human shortcomings which constrain collaborative behaviour. Developing systems of interconnectivity to maximise collaboration may require an explicit systems approach, which explicitly models human shortcomings as part of systems. Forrester (1971, p. 110) argues that: \u2026 the human mind is not adapted to interpreting how social systems behave. Our social systems belong to the class called multi-loop nonlinear feedback systems. In the long history of evolution it has not been necessary for man to understand these systems until very recent historical times. Evolutionary processes have not given us the mental skill needed to properly interpret the dynamic behaviour of the systems of which we have now become a part.\n",

Human intuition, however, is shaped by feedback from simple systems, where causes of problems are proximal to their symptoms, but complex dynamic systems typically have causes which are separated from the problem both in time and space; what might appear to be causes can be coincident occurrences caused by feedback-loop dynamics of a larger system which also produce the problem itself (Forrester, 1971).

Pisano and Verganti (2008, p. 79) explain this further as follows:With open participation, you don\u2019t need to know your contributors. Indeed, the fact that you don\u2019t know them can be particularly valuable; interesting innovative solutions can come from people or organisations you might never have imagined had something to contribute. That is the concept behind Threadless.com, a largely online retailer of T-shirts, whose designs come from the masses. By operating an innovation mall where 600,000 members submit proposals for about 800 new designs weekly, Threadless gets a steady flow of unusual and singular ideas. (Mall members and visitors to the website vote on the designs, but the Threadless staff makes the final decision on which ones to produce and rewards their creators).For Shum et al. (2012, p. 109), the development of, and application of, collective intelligence is an urgent imperative to address the \u2018urgent, systemic problems now threatening the sustainability of societies.\u2019 Key to this, according to Shum et al. (2012), is the development of a global sociotechnical infrastructure, an example of which is the Global Participatory Platform (GPP). Shum et al. (2012, p. 109) conceptualise this type of sociotechnical system, or GPP as:a framework for different stakeholders to find their ecological niches at different levels within the system, serving the functions of (i) sensing the environment in order to pool data, (ii) mining the resulting data for patterns in order to model the past/present/future, and (iii) sharing and contesting possible interpretations of what those models might mean, and in a policy context, possible decisions \u2026 a resilient, epistemic ecosystem, whose design will make it capable of self-organisation and adaptation to a dynamic environment, and whose structure and contributions are themselves networks of stakeholders, challenges, issues, ideas and arguments whose structure and dynamics can be modelled and analysed.\n",

The One Billion Minds approach for open innovation (http://www.onebillionminds.com/) has already been mapped into the Life Sciences, where a million minds in the community have been called to participate in community annotation in Wikeproteins (http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/5//R89)To maximise collaborations further, these sites could be networked, as part of a global sociotechnical system. Lessons for real-time response can also be drawn from disaster management, and how sociotechnical systems operate to achieve real-time outcomes (Callaghan, 2016). Effectively, the development of a global sociotechnical system (or GPP to solve global societal problems) entails the democratisation of knowledge and processes, ensuring their contribution as a public good; this also entails engagement, and enablement, of different stakeholder groups (Shum et al., 2012). Shum et al.

The success of a global knowledge creation system seeking to maximise collaborations may also be dependent on the rate at which the system can learn. The literature discussed in preceding sections is taken to represent work related to how collaborative research can leveraged to better solve research problems, or relating to \u2018collaborative leverage\u2019; what links this literature is therefore its potential contribution to the goal of maximising collaborative problem-solving.",

The theorists in the innermost frame are taken to represent those with perhaps the most salient contributions to collaborative problem-solving. Those in the outer frame are taken to offer theoretical frameworks which further support the collaborative leverage process. The identification, and potential integration, of these subordinate bodies of theory into a core body of literature to support maximised collaborative problem-solving systems is considered important, for the following reasons. First, it is argued technological advancements have enabled what is essentially a new paradigm in collaborative problem-solving, and that over and above accelerating trends toward collaborations (Adams et al., 2004), a proactive attempt to \u2018catch\u2019 this building wave and operationalise its potential may result in dramatic improvements in global social problem-solving.\n",

Dominant in this body of literature is the simple notion that increased networking and collaborations can accelerate research and problem-solving, and that a radical approach to increasing these also required scholarly attention. Increased transparency and participation by stakeholders of all stripes is perhaps already changing the power dynamics of science and its problem-solving processes, reflecting a global shift toward probabilistic innovation; this shift is perhaps a necessary condition, in that the lack of outright solutions to apocalyptic problems sooner or later will trigger the necessity as \u2018mother of invention\u2019 effect, and people will ultimately start to \u2018self-organise\u2019 and begin to develop radical and novel solutions in response to these crises. This paper has sought to do just this, and to document emergence of these ideas. Further development of this stream of literature may usefully seek to document and investigate these ideas further.

A body of theory was identified and incorporated into discussion of what might be an emerging field, relating to how global systems of networked collaborations could usefully contribute to a radical new paradigm of maximised collaborative problem-solving. It was also argued that these developments reflect a deeper movement, perhaps on the scale of a social movement, toward the democratisation of science and the involvement of all affected stakeholders as problem-solving collaborators in some form or the other. These changes might herald the advent of a new era of transparency, harnessing of collective intelligence and the involvement (and legitimisation of involvement) of the \u2018crowd\u2019 in matters that affect it.",
