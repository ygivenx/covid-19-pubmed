Infants, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly are particularly susceptible, with 90% of deaths occurring in the latter group [2]. Influenza viruses can also cause pandemics that, although rare, are recurrent events historically associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality [3], [4], [5], [6]. Preventive vaccination has historically been the most efficient measure of influenza control, but this approach presents important limitations due to the accumulation of antigenic mutations in the virus, known as antigenic drift. Vaccines typically elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response limited to the specific viral strains included in the preparation and to closely related viruses [2]. For this reason, seasonal vaccines need to be annually reformulated based upon the forecasting of viral strains that will circulate in the coming influenza season. Furthermore, influenza vaccines have suboptimal immunogenicity and efficacy in the groups at highest risk of severe disease [7]. Moreover in the case of a pandemic, the use of vaccine is limited by the time required for its development and deployment [8].",

However, the natural and/or acquired resistance to these drugs has been reported [9], [10]. Resistance to adamantanes is prevalent among seasonal and avian influenza A viruses significantly reducing their usefulness [11], [12]. The sudden and widespread emergence of resistance to oseltamivir among pre-pandemic H1N1 viruses has raised further concerns over the current therapeutic options [13], [14]. Oseltamivir resistance was reported in patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 viruses and highly virulent H5N1 viruses [15], [16]. The resistance to zanamivir is rare [17], but its use is limited to patients who can actively inhale it, which often excludes young children, impaired older adults or patients with underlying airway disease [14], that is the groups of patients most vulnerable to serious influenza infection complications.",

The results obtained showed that IgG PN-SIA49 has a stronger neutralizing activity compared to Fab PN-SIA49 (Table 1) [26], [27]. Indeed, IgG PN-SIA49 neutralized all tested viruses belonging to group 1, except the virus strain belonging to H9N2 subtype, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging between 0.1\u20131.9 \u00b5g/ml (Table 1 and Figure S1).

Consistent with the in-vitro neutralizing activity, PN-SIA49 at 10 mg/kg afforded 66.6% protection against lethal H5N1 virus challenge (Figure 1D) whereas control mice rapidly succumbed to infection by day 8 post-challenge (p.c.).

Furthermore, IgG PN-SIA49 is endowed with a stronger neutralizing activity compared to its monovalent molecule (Table 1). Indeed, it is well documented in the literature that bivalency of IgG molecule may be an essential feature for the biological activity of a mAb, mostly due to an increase in antibody avidity [33], [34], [35], [36]. The increased avidity may also play an important role in the prophylactic and therapeutic application of an antibody, allowing the administration of smaller amount compared to the Fab fragment. Additionally, the whole IgG molecule has a longer half-life than its fragments, with a consequent prolonged effect of the molecule. For all these reasons, we used IgG PN-SIA49 to treat mice infected with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses and data obtained show that PN-SIA49 protects mice from H1N1 and H5N1 virus lethal challenge suggesting its potential application in treatment of influenza virus infections.",
