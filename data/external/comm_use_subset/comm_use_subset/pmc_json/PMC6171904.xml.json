Poor clinical outcomes of glioblastoma are due to aggressive brain infiltration, driven in part by microRNA-mediated alterations in protein levels [2], leading to inevitable recurrence after surgery [3]. Conventional treatment methods such as surgery, primary treatment method, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have not proven to be effective [4] for this aggressive disease with a median survival time of approximately 15 months from the time of diagnosis [5\u20137]. In particular, invasive GBM cells, described as \u201cguerrilla-like warriors\u201d, can escape surgery and are protected behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and survive biochemical attacks from chemotherapy [8, 9]. Innovative new therapeutic approaches to block these invasive cells are needed in order to improve clinical outcome [10].",

            "text": "In the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells need to adapt to biochemical challenges including acidity, hypoxia, and limited nutrient availability [1]. In order to sustain rapid growth, cancerous cells modify their metabolic activity by increasing glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, which requires high levels of glucose uptake, known as the Warburg effect [11, 12]. Differentiated cells favor oxidative phosphorylation via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA), or Krebs cycle, the major energy producing mechanism, which is very efficient in terms of ATP production. However, tumor cells adopt the seemingly inefficient process of aerobic glycolysis [13], which leads to consumption of large amounts of glucose and production of lactic acid [12]. Aerobic glycolysis [14] may provide tumor cells with the advantage of reducing the heavy dependency on oxygen for energy especially in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, increasing a chance for longer survival and also promotes tumor growth by shuttling metabolites into biosynthetic pathways rather than ATP synthesis [12, 14]. Adequate cellular responses to glucose withdrawal are critical for glioma cell survival in the hostile microenvironment where glucose levels may fluctuate. Under metabolic stress, cells activate the 5\u2032-adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, the master cellular sensor of energy availability [15], in order to promote glucose uptake and to conserve energy [15], avoiding cell death.",

Dysregulation of microRNA expression has been associated with oncogenic and tumor suppressor activities [18, 19] in several types of cancer, including GBM [20, 21]. Godlewski et al. [1, 22] identified the functional importance of miR-451 which targets the AMPK complex (LKB1/CAB39/STRAD/AMPK/MARK) and regulates cell fate in response to fluctuating glucose levels. (i) normal glucose levels induce up-regulation of miR-451 and down-regulation of AMPK complex, which induces elevated proliferation and decreased cell polarity/migration and (ii) glucose withdrawal leads to down-regulation of miR-451 and up-regulation of AMPK activity, which in turn induces increased cell polarity/migration and reduced cell proliferation.

            "text": "Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), major components of the brain extracellular matrix (ECM) in the brain [23], are reported to play a pivotal role in inhibiting axon growth and regeneration process in scars after CNS damage [24]. CSPGs are also known to serve as biophysical barriers, preventing brain cells from migrating across the boundary of two adjacent structures during CNS development [25\u201332]. In CNS tumors, CSPGs may provide a structural foundation and guidance for tumor invasion [33] as well as a physical barrier for cell infiltration like other ECMs. Not surprisingly, this heavy chain of CSPGs has been associated with tumor growth, penetration into neighboring tissues, and angiogenesis [34]. The accumulating interstitial pressure and severe tortuosity in the extracellular space within the tumor [1] due to the high concentration of CSPG ECM are a severe limiting factor for efficient delivery of large therapeutic drugs [35]. Therefore, lowering the CSPG levels by an digestive enzyme was suggested as a way of promoting intratumoral transport of larger therapeutic compounds, making this ECM a potential target for adjuvant therapy [36, 37]. For example, tumor growth and invasion was reduced when these ECM molecules were digested by blocking antibodies against versican [36] or manipulating RNA against phosphacan [38]. CSPG degradation by classical proteases such as MMP-1 and MMP-8 also results in an increase in diffusion and hydraulic conductivity in solid tumors [39]. In oncolytic virus therapy, the diffusion-limiting properties of CSPGs are blamed for low therapeutic anti-tumor efficacy due to the inefficient intratumoral spread of oncolytic viruses within the compact glioma [40, 41]. The CSPG receptor LAR was shown to be involved in promoting or inhibiting tumor invasion [33, 42]. In recent work [42], CSPGs were suggested to be a biochemical indicator of non-invasive tumor and diffusely infiltrating tumor. In the study, they found that (i) a CSPG-rich microenvironment was associated with a strong cell-ECM adhesion and stimulated resident astrocytes to actively escape the CSPG-dense lesions, leading to the self-contained non-invasive tumor surrounded by astrocytes. (ii) Glycosylated CSPGs were not found in invasive GBM [42] and no collective migration of astrocytes was observed. (iii) These CSPG conditions also changed the profile of ramified and activated microglia within and outside the tumor. (iv) CSPG-induced cell-ECM bonding was mediated by its receptor LAR and LAR-CSGAG complex [42]. Integrins usually mediate the cell-matrix interactions by tethering the cell to its surrounding ECM and activating intracellular signalling cascades [43, 44].",

M1 and M2 types of microglia were shown to promote glioma cell invasion by exchanging signaling molecules such as CSF-1, EGF and TGF-\u03b2 [49\u201352]. Astrocytes also play a significant role in the progression, aggression, and angiogenesis of CNS tumors [53, 54]. Mutual crosstalk between glioma cells and astrocytes plays a central role in cell infiltration through blood vessels through regulation of H+/Ca2+-channels [55] and is also responsible for resistance to therapy [53]. Resident astrocytes show reactive response with upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and MMPs in a co-culture with glioma cells U87 [56]. These complex biomechanical interactions may deter tumor cell infiltration [57, 58]. However, the fundamental mechanism of formation of these two distinct (invasive vs non-invasive) gliomas is poorly understood.",

Mathematical models developed by Kim et al. [62, 63] and other research groups [64\u201368] showed that the go-or-grow pattern of glioma cells can be determined by key regulatory factors including cell-ECM interaction, chemotaxis toward nutrients (glucose, oxygen), and cell-cell adhesion [69]. Powathil et al. [70] developed a multi-scale model, based on a classical cell cycle model by Tyson and Novak [71, 72], to investigate the effects of hypoxia on the cell cycle and tumor growth. Lee et al. [73] developed an IBM-based, multi-scale model in order to investigate the role of myosin II in regulation of deformation of the membrane and nucleus that is necessary for glioma cell infiltration through narrow intercellular gaps between normal glial cells. Recently, Kim et al. [49] modeled and analyzed the biochemical interaction between a glioma and M1/M2 microglia for their promoting role of glioma invasion. A mathematical model developed in [41] showed that CSPGs can inhibit OV spread as a physical barrier, decreasing anti-tumor efficacy of OV therapies. However, how the glioma cell invasion is regulated by the miR-451-AMPK-mTOR-cell cycle signaling network and CSPG-mediated remodeling of microenvironment (microglia and astrocytes) in the brain is poorly understood.",

Using these kinetic relations they explain the transitions between two main steady states, G1 and S-G2-M of the cell-cycle, which is controlled by changes in cell mass. Recently, Powathil et al. [70] used the equivalent mammalian proteins stated in Tyson and Novak\u2019s paper, namely the Cdk-cyclin B complex [CycB], the APC-Cdh1 complex [Cdh1], the active form of the p55cdc-APC complex [p55cdcA], the total p55cdc-APC complex [p55cdcT], the active form of Plk1 protein [Plk1] and the mass of the cell [mass] to include the intracellular cell-cycle dynamics in their hybrid model.

In this model, a new switch will be considered for quiescent stage (G0-phase) to explore the dynamic transition between migration and proliferation phases of the cell. The newly introduced pseudo-mass ([mass]s) will control the normal cell cycle and quiescent state so that it will put the tumour cell into G0 phase or in a typical cell cycle based on environmental stimuli such as glucose. The basic idea is that (i) when mTOR is up-regulated (proliferative phase; up-regulated miR-451, down-regulated AMPK), [masss] is equal to [mass], hence we are back to typical cell cycle; and (ii) when mTOR is down-regulated (migratory phase; down-regulated miR-451; up-regulated AMPK), the switch function (second term in the Eq (13)) gives us a high value (\u03b6) that results in high values of [masss], leading this way to the G0 phase.

These processes include tightly controlled signaling pathways [87, 88], control of tension, traction force generation on the adhesive binding sites [83], and feedback regulation of the actomyosin network [89, 90]. For example, the myosin II plays a significant role in glioma cell infiltration through the narrow intercellular gap between normal glial cells in tumor microenvironment by deforming both cell membrane and nucleus [91]. This specific role of myosin II and effect of its inhibitor such as Blebbistatin was investigated by Lee et al. [73]. In this work, we don\u2019t consider a detailed process of myosin II-mediated nucleus deformation or collective cell migration, which are certainly key aspects in a critical stage of many cancers [90]. Instead, we take into account the cell-ECM adhesion on initiation of tumor cell invasion. Here, we assume that the traction force is generated for only the cells that are under the following circumstances: (i) without physical constraints, (ii) that receive the correct migratory signal, (iii) that are free of the strong LAR-CSGAG binding.",

Finally, \u03b6i is the unbinding strength in [CSPG]-[LAR] reaction at the ith cell site. More precisely, the unbinding strength to CSPGs (\u03b6i) at the cell site i is given by\n\u03b6i=\u03b6i([(E\u00b7R\u00af])=[SER/([E\u00b7R\u00af]+\u03f5i)]m1KERm1+[SER/([E\u00b7R\u00af]+\u03f5i)]m1(27)\nwhere [E\u00b7R\u00af] is the [CS-GAG]-[LAR] levels, and m1,KER,SER,\u03f5i(m1\u2208Z+,KER\u2208R+,\u03f5i\u2208R+,\u03f5i\u2aa11) are Hill-type coefficients.

We note that a small randomness in the magnitude of traction force is allowed. So, the traction force is completely turned off for glioma cells in the growth phase, adhesive cells with high affinity to CSPGs via [CS-GAG]-[LAR] binding, or cells under physical constraints such as cells inside the dense tumor core. A cell is considered to be under physical constraints when other cells are present in the migration direction (Ti,g). For a more precise algorithm, let j, the index of a neighboring cell whose center position is in the closest direction to the migration direction (Ti,g), be given by j={k:maxk\u2208Niaxk-xi\u2223xk-xi\u2223\u00b7T^i} where T^i=Ti,g|Ti,g|, xk is the location of the center of the k-th cell, Nia={k:0<\u2223xk-xi\u2223\u2264dn} is the cells in the neighborhood of the cell i. The cell i is under physical constraints if j > 0. For example, the traction force is completely turned off when the glioma cell is completely surrounded by neighboring cells in the tumor core [61] or its infiltration is blocked by a thick layer of astrocytes at the edge of the growing tumor [42].",

In order to take into account the effect of glucose conditions in our model on phenotypic changes (proliferative versus migratory), we first test how the glucose level (G) affects the levels of key players (M, A, R) in our core control system. In Fig 3 we illustrate three different patterns of the steady state (SS; circles in Fig 3A\u20133F) of the core control system in response to low (G = 0.1; Fig 3A and 3D), intermediate (G = 0.45; Fig 3B and 3E), and high (G = 1.0; Fig 3C and 3F) levels of glucose in the M-A and R-A phase diagrams. By taking the thresholds, thM (= 2.0) of miR-451 levels, thA (= 2.0) of AMPK complex, and thR (= 3.0) of mTOR, we shall define the migratory region Tm (red dotted boxes in Fig 3A\u20133F) by\nTm={(M,A,R)\u2208R2:M<thM,A>thA,R<thR}\nand the proliferative region Tp (blue dotted boxes in Fig 3A\u20133F) by\nTp={(M,A,R)\u2208R2:M>thM,A<thA,R>thR}.",

This down-regulation of miR-451 and mTOR, and increased AMPK activity increase the migratory status of the cell. In contrast, the up-regulation of miR-451, and low AMPK activity, and increased mTOR level, leading to a proliferative phase, are induced under normal (high) glucose conditions (G = 1.0; Fig 3C and 3F; one SS Shigh = (4.11, 0.42, 4.59)).

As G is decreased (for example when glucose consumption is increased due to fast tumor growth), the miR-451 and mTOR levels remains elevated and AMPK activity is suppressed, until it reaches the left knee point of the curve (\u223c0.4), at which time the miR-451 and mTOR levels jump down to the lower branch and AMPK is up-regulated. Then the cell switches to the migratory mode. Therefore, the effect of glucose is history dependent: For an intermediate level of glucose (0.4=bmw<G<bMw=0.6; bi-stable mode in Fig 3B), the cells are in the proliferative phase if G was in decreasing mode, and in the migratory phase if G was in increasing mode. The bifurcation diagram in Fig 3J suggests that a state (G, M, R) with M > thM = 2.0, R > thR = 3.0 will be moved by the dynamic system (1)\u2013(3) into the upper stable branch, resulting in over-expression of miR-451 and mTOR and, thus, cells will be in the proliferation phase. On the other hand, if M < thM = 2.0, R < thR = 3.0, then (G, M, R) will stay in the lower stable state branch, leading to cell migration. This is consistent with results shown in [59] for a smaller miR-451-AMPK system. Fig 3K summarizes the relative locations of the proliferative and migratory phases in state of those key variables (miR-451, AMPK, and mTOR). As mentioned above, the behaviors of mTOR are same as those of miR-451.",

The cell dynamically changes its cell cycle status in response to the different glucose levels, alternating between high and low conditions. Under a normoxia condition, the initially high glucose level induces upregulation of miR-451 and mTOR levels and downregulation of the AMPK complex, sending a signal for a normal cell cycles (No of cell cycles = 8). When glucose is deprived around t = 300 h, the cell enters a quiescent phase (G0 phase; [G0] = 1) via downregulation of miR-451/mTOR levels and upregulation of the AMPK kinases, However, the cell returns to the normal active cell cycle when the glucose level is increased to the normal level around t = 500 h. Under a hypoxic condition, high glucose levels also induce the slower cell cycle (No of cell cycles = 3) via the miR-451-AMPK-mTOR core control system. Like the normoxia case, glucose deprivation induces the low mTOR (low miR-451, high AMPK) level, leading to G0 phase, but the subsequent escalation of glucose brings the cellular status back to a normal cell cycle through the miR-451-AMPK-mTOR system, escaping the G0 phase.",

Fig 5A\u20135C show time courses of variables in cell cycle (CycB, Cdh1, p55cdcT, p55cdcA, plk1, mass, and masss) and miR-451-AMPK-mTOR module when \u03b1 = 1.0 (low), 1.6 (base; \u03b1*), 2.5 (high). In the base case, the cell cycle system responds naturally to fluctuating glucose conditions, i.e. transitions between normal cell cycle and G0 phases in response to escalating or descending glucose levels (Fig 5B). For a low value of \u03b1 (\u03b1 = 1.0), the probability of having a proliferation phase is increased and the migration phase is impossible since the bifurcation curves (steady states of miR-451, AMPK complex, and mTOR (Ms, As, Rs) as a function of G) moves to the left (S1 Appendix). Therefore, the initial glucose level still leads to normal cell cycle via upregulated levels of miR451/mTOR and the corresponding low AMPK activities in the core system but the proliferation phase Tp with a normal cell cycle still persists in response to the low glucose level around the time intervals ([180 h, 220 h]\u222a[580 h, 620 h]) due to the sustained levels of miR-451, AMPK complex, and mTOR (M(t) > 3.0 > thM; R(t) > 4.1 > thR;A(t) < 1.0 < thA) as shown in Fig 5A. Therefore, lowering \u03b1 leads to a normal cell cycle regardless of high and low glucose conditions. When \u03b1 is increased (\u03b1 = 2.5; Fig 5C), the system induces the Tm-phase even for relatively high glucose levels, decreasing the chance of generating a normal cell cycle. Therefore, the enhanced inhibitory activities of miR-451 (\u03b1) increase the duration of the G0-phase and decrease the duration of the normal cell cycle. This effect of \u03b1 on the G0-phase and normal cell cycle is similar to the impact of \u03b3 due to the structure of the network and its dynamics (S1 Appendix). Fig 5D shows the distribution of duration of normal cell cycles and G0-phase for various \u03b1\u2019s (\u03b1 = 1.0, 1.6, 2.0, 2.5). As \u03b1 is increased, the average duration of G0-phase (red bar) is increased and the tumor cell spends more time in the quiescent phase. While the cell cycle period stays almost the same (\u223c30h), the total number of normal cell cycles (black circle) is significantly decreased due to the increased duration of the G0-phase.",

Fig 6A and 6B show time courses of variables in cell cycle (CycB, Cdh1, p55cdcT, p55cdcA, plk1, mass, and masss) and miR-451-AMPK-mTOR module when \u03b2 is decreased (\u03b2 = 1.0(\u03b2*) \u2192 0.07) or increased (\u03b2 = 1.0(\u03b2*) \u2192 2.0). For a low value of \u03b2 (\u03b2 = 0.07), the bifurcation curve is shifted to the right and the system induces the Tm-phase in response to high and low glucose levels (S1 Appendix) due to continuous suppressed levels of miR-451 and mTOR, and upregulation of the AMPK complex level (M(t) < 1.3 < thM; R(t) < 1.8 < thR;A(t) > 3.0 > thA)). This induces the continuous duration of the G0-phase in the presence of glucose fluctuation. On the contrary, when \u03b2 is increased to 2.5, the probability of Tp (or Tm) is increased (or decreased). The initial normal cell cycle from the high glucose level persists despite the low glucose level around the time intervals ([180 h, 220 h]\u222a[580 h, 620 h]) because it stays in the upper branch of the bifurcation curve (S1 Appendix). Therefore, the system adapts to full normal cell cycle without entering the G0-phase even in tumor microenvironment with fluctuating glucose supply. Fig 6C shows the distribution of duration of normal cell cycle and G0-phase for various \u03b2\u2019s (\u03b2 = 0.07, 1.0, 2.0). As \u03b2 is increased, the cell reduces G0-phase (red bar), increasing the total number of normal cell cycles (black circle). Fig 6D illustrates the distinct characteristic changes of the cell cycle mode in the \u03c4cyc \u2212 \u03c4G0 plane when \u03b2 is either increased or decreased. Here, \u03c4cyc, \u03c4G0 are duration of the normal cell cycle and G0 phases, respectively. The enhanced inhibitory activities of the AMPK complex (\u03b2) may enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy while an decrease in \u03b2 results in the quiescence-state system.",

While a high CSPG condition induces active and strong binding of a tumor cell to the ECM component by forming the [LAR]-[CSGAG] complex, low levels of CSPG in microenvironment do not warrant this adhesion. Fig 8B shows CSPG binding levels for various CSPG levels (E* = 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 50, 100, 250 \u03bcg/ml). In general, an increase in CSPG levels induces an increase in the binding. This transient activation of LAR-CSGAG binding is in good agreement with experiments by Fisher et al. [78]. In Fig 8C and 8D, we investigate CSGAG-LAR binding activities for various binding ratios KD=koffkon=0.03,2.9(base),29.5,296nM in response to dynamical changes in CSPG levels (E(t) = 50*cos(\u03c0t/24) + 50); Fig 8C). For the base parameter value (KD = 2.9 nM), the strong initial binding activities are weakened as the high CSPG level decreases and this binding force is enhanced again when the CSPG level is increased again. When KD is small (KD = 0.03 nM; red dashed), the system maintains the high level of the adhesion between a tumor cell and ECM in spite of the fluctuating CSPG levels. When KD is large (KD = 296 nM), the binding activity is reduced to 60% in response to the high CSPG level and still fluctuates to the changing CSPG stimuli. Fig 8E shows time courses of unbinding strength \u03b6i for various Hill coefficients (m1 = 1, 2(base), 10) in response to the fluctuating CSPG levels E(t) = 5 * cos(\u03c0t/24) + 5. Initial condition was R(0)=10,E\u00b7R\u00af(0)=0. The usual low unbinding strength from high CSPG levels transits to a peak high value whenever the CSPG level is low, leading to the aggressive invasion of a tumor cell (m1 = 2* (base); black solid). This suppressed \u03b6i (\u03b6i = 0, black arrowheads), i.e., strong LAR-CSGAG binding, prevents a tumor cell from invading the surrounding brain tissue in a CSPG-rich microenvironment. For a higher Hill coefficient (m1 = 10; blue dotted), the invasion is governed by the same CSPG-mediated regulation. For a lower Hill coefficient (m1 = 1, red dashed), \u03b6i shows the similar transient behaviors but the base \u03b6i value is increased, leading to the possibility of tumor cell invasion even in the CSPG-rich environment. Fig 8F shows time courses of unbinding strength \u03b6i for various KER = 0.005, 0.5(base), 5 in response to the fluctuating CSPG levels E(t) = 5*cos(\u03c0t/24) + 5. When KER is too large (KER = 5, blue dotted), the system does not generate enough stimulus of tumor cell invasion in a CSPG-depleted environment around t = 24 h and t = 72 h. On the other hand, when KER is too small (KER = 0.005, red dashed), the system maintains the high level of unbinding strength \u03b6i, leading to unrealistically persistent invasion stimuli in a CSPG-rich microenvironment.",

While tumor cells actively migrate away from the main tumor core in response to a low CSPG level (Fig 9A), no invasion activities are observed in a CSPG-rich environment (Fig 9B). A low CSPG microenvironment induces the down-regulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex (Fig 9M) and the weak binding between a tumor cell and surrounding ECM, allowing active migration of the tumor cell on the surface of the growing tumor core (Fig 9A). On the other hand, a tumor cell can form a tight adhesion to the neighboring CSGAG ECM in a CSPG-rich environment by up-regulating the LAR-CSGAG complex (Fig 9N), preventing the dispersal of glioma cells into the surrounding brain tissue (Fig 9B). Astrocytes in tumor microenvironment do not physically respond to the low CSPG level (Fig 9C). On the other hand, the heavy CSPG chains also induce active collective movement of astrocytes toward the periphery of the tumor (Fig 9D). Fig 9E shows the subsequent accumulation of astrocytes on the periphery of the growing tumor at the final time (t = 57 h) in a close-up profile. This dense band of interwoven astrocytes on the boundary of the solid tumor may constrain invasive tumor cells by providing a physical barrier [42]. Fig 9F shows the number of invasive astrocytes at time t = 2, 5, 10, 57 h in the low (blue) and high (yellow) CSPG conditions. Fig 9G and 9H show the spatial profile of ramified (pink asterisk) and activated (red circle) microglia at final time (t = 57 h) in response to low and high CSPG levels, respectively. Unlike astrocytes, no physical displacement of microglia is observed in both invasive and noninvasive tumors but distinct and uniform microglial activation states are apparent in spatial domain. While most of microglia are activated within the tumor core, no activation changes of initial ramified microglia are not observed in a low CSPG condition. The high level of CSPG divides the tumor microenvironment into two regions, tumor core region with activated microglia and stromal region with ramified microglia. This critical separation indicates that CSPG plays a central role in activation of the immune cells, microglia (Fig 9J). These different activation status of microglia were observed in glioma [49, 52, 108, 109] as well as other CNS diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s [110, 111] and Parkinson\u2019s disease [112]. Fig 9K and 9L show populations of growing and invasive tumor cells at time t = 12, 24, 57 h in response to low and high CSPG levels, respectively. Fig 9M and 9N show time courses of concentrations of [LAR] (blue solid) and its complex ([LAR]-[CS-GAG]; red dashed) at a tumor cell site (cellid = 32) in response to low and high CSPGs. This illustrates that the upregulated LAR-CSGAG complex in response to the high CSPG level is responsible for tight anchoring of a tumor cell to the heavy chain of CSPG ECM.",

            "text": "\nFig 10A shows the number of reactive (invasive) astrocytes in response to various levels of CSPGs (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123, 25, 125, 250 \u03bcg/ml). At relatively low concentrations of CSPGs (1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123), the astrocytes remain within the tumor microenvironment. However, with increasing CSPG concentrations (25, 125, 250 \u03bcg/ml), the astrocytes become reactive to the CSPG ECM and move toward the outer tumor boundary. These results suggest that abundant CSPGs are sufficient to induce displacement of astrocytes, leading to a thick wall of astrocytes surrounding the noninvasive tumor. We further tested how tumor-associated CSPGS can change the activation status of microglia within the noninvading lesions. Fig 10B shows the population of ramified (blue) and activated (yellow) microglia in response to various levels of CSPGs (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122, 25, 125, 250 \u03bcg/ml). A low level of CSPGs (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122) induced only ramified microglia. However, as the CSPG concentration increases (25 \u2192 125 \u2192 250 \u03bcg/ml), the population of activated microglia increases and population of the ramified microglia decreases. Those changes in reactive astrocytes (Fig 10A) and activation status of microglia (Fig 10B) as a function of the CSPG level are associated with decreasing population of invasive tumor cells (Fig 10C). Whereas LAR-CSGAG reactions are uniformly observed throughout the CSPG-rich noninvasive tumor (E* = 250 \u03bcg/ml; Fig 10E), it is absent in invasive tumor lesions with a low CSPG concentration (E* = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122\n\u03bcg/ml; Fig 10D). These district uniform distributions of the CSPG receptor molecules (LAR) are in good agreement with experimental observation [42]. The specific LAR-CSGAG binding activities in response to various CSPG levels (2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122, 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22121, 2.5, 250 \u03bcg/ml) are shown in Fig 10F. In the low CSPG condition, the LAR-CSGAG concentration is down-regulated and the binding activity is suppressed (E* = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122). However, as the CSPG concentration is increased, the level of LAR-CSGAG complex is increased, leading to a tight adhesion between the glioma cells and their ECM. CSPGs in turn is anchored by this LAR-mediated adhesion within the tumor lesion and resist tumor cell invasion.",

            "text": "We now investigate the effect of a breakdown of CS-GAG-mediated tumor-ECM bonding on tumor invasion. Chase-ABC has been used for degradation of CSPGs in many studies [24, 40, 41, 45, 46]. For example, treatment of the injured spinal cord in the brain with the Chase-ABC cleaves CSPG GAG side chains [113] and alterations in CSPG expression may occur both near and far from the site of spinal injury [114]. Fig 11A shows the spatial profiles of tumor cells at t = 0 (A1), 30 (A2), 45 (A3), 57 h (A4) when a CSPG-rich ECM is treated by Chase-ABC. Recall that no migratory tumor cells were observed in response to a high CSPG level (Fig 9B). A Chase-ABC-induced breakdown of CSPGs leads to active migration of tumor cells on the surface of the growing tumor core. Fig 11B and 11C show the spatial distribution of CSPG and Chase-ABC, respectively, at t = 0 (B1,C1), 10 (B2,C2), 57 h (B3,C2). Fig 9D shows time courses of concentrations of receptor LAR and the LAR-CSGAG complex at the site (cell id = 211) of a tumor cell (red arrow in Fig 9A) that was initially located within the tumor core (red arrow in Fig 9(A1). Initially, the LAR-CSGAG complex level is up-regulated in response to a high CSPG concentration (t = 0 h), preventing the tumor cell from invading the surrounding brain tissue. However, the subsequent Chase-ABC-mediated depletion of CSPGs (Fig 9(B2)) leads to a transition to down-regulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex level (black arrow in Fig 9D) at t = 10 h, resulting in the release of the tight adhesion to the tumor ECM and aggressive invasion of the tumor cell (Fig 9(A3) and 9(A4)). It is worth noting that this tumor cell (cellid = 211) begins to migrate from the surface of the tumor at a much later time (t > 30 h) despite the migration signal (the phase transition to down-regulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex) at the earlier time (t \u223c 10 h). This inhibition of tumor cell migration (cellid = 211) is due to physical constraints from the surrounding tumor cells within the tumor core (Fig 9(A2)). Once the tumor cell is free from other neighboring cells, the tumor cell on the surface of the tumor core initiates the invasion process without the associated mechanical anchoring to the tumor ECM. Fig 9E shows the normalized cell index for growth (blue) and invasion (yellow) of tumor cells at final time (t = 57 h) in response to low, high, and high+Chase-ABC CSPG levels. Chase-ABC-induced degradation of CSPGs changes the non-invasive tumor type to an invasive tumor. The invasion index in a Chase-ABC-treated tumor is small relative to the low CSPG case due to the delay of CSPG degradation by Chase-ABC. In Fig 9F, we investigate the effect of Chase-ABC treatment on tumor invasion in various CSPG conditions (E0 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122, 2.5, 25, 250 \u03bcg/mL). Chase-ABC may induce a nonlinear dynamics in tumor cell invasion. In general, in the intermediate and low levels of CSPGs (E0 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122, 2.5, 25 \u03bcg/mL), the ratio of Chase-ABC-mediated tumor cell invasion relative to the control case (case without Chase-ABC) is larger than in the high CSPG condition (E0 = 250 \u03bcg/mL), due to the faster degradation of CSPGs by the Chase-ABC. Fig 9G shows time courses of levels of LAR and the LAR-CSGAG complex at a cell site (cell id = 211) under a slower decay condition (\u03bcE*=1.0\u00d710-4\u03bcE). The phase transition (black arrow) from the strong (up-regulated LAR-CSGAG complex) to weak (down-regulated LAR-CSGAG complex) cell-ECM bond is delayed (Tt = 10h \u2192 20h), compared to the control case (Fig 9D). In Fig 9H and 9I, we investigate the dynamics of tumor invasion for various degradation rates of CSPGs by Chase-ABC: \u03bcE = 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22124, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22122, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121, 1-fold. As \u03bcE is decreased, the slower degradation of CSPGs delays the transition time (Fig 9I) for weakening of the tumor cell-ECM adhesive bonds, leading to the lower tumor invasion index (Fig 9H).",

            "text": "CSPGs, major components of ECM in the brain may form a complex structure such as a patch morphology like a dandelion clock [115] or a ring-like structure with partial opening [114]. Fig 12A and 12B show time courses of growth/invasion patterns at t = 0h (A1,B1), 20h (A2,B2), 36h (A3,B3), 60h (A4,B4) in the presence of a thick CSPG ring without (Fig 12A) and with (Fig 12B) a partial open section. Four invasion sectors in the domain are marked as Q1 (north-east), Q2 (north-west), Q3 (south-west), Q4 (south-east). See Fig 12A. Fig 12C and 12D show spatial distributions of CSPG levels for circular thick CSPG bands surrounding the tumor at the center of the domain in closed and open cases, respectively. For both cases, tumor cells initially invade the brain tissue in response to low CSPG levels on the periphery of the tumor by down-regulating the LAR-CSGAG complex level. Fig 12E and 12F show time courses of levels of LAR and the LAR-CSGAG complex at a cell site (cell id = 211; arrowheads in Fig 12(A4) and 12(B4)) in closed and open cases, respectively. In the closed case, tumor cell invasion on the front migration wave in all sections (Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4) is inhibited by up-regulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex level (arrow in Fig 12E) on the thick CSPG barrier at a later stage. In the open case, the tumor cells in the Q1 sector invade the brain tissue through the open space (arrowhead in Fig 12(B4)) with sustained downregulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex level (arrow in Fig 12F). Fig 12G and 12H show time courses of normalized tumor cell populations for total migratory cells (black dashed) outside the tumor core, migratory cells inside the ring structure (blue solid), and escaped migratory cells (green circle), in closed and open cases, respectively. Distribution of tumor cell population that adhered to the boundary of the CSPG-rich region at time t = 30, 40, 50, 60 h are shown in Fig 12I in more detail: cells in Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4 regions in the open (o-Q; dark blue) and closed case (c-Q, light blue), cells in the Q1 region only in the open (o-Q1; green) and closed case (c-Q1; yellow). In the closed case, tumor cells respond to the heavy chain of CSPGs and form strong adhesion to the CSPG ECM uniformly on the boundary of the CSPGs in the all sectors (c-Q) including the Q1 sector (c-Q1). In the open case, less tumor cells are adhered to the CSPG band in the Q2,Q3,Q4 sectors (o-Q) due to a subgroup of invasive tumor cells through the open space in the Q1 sector (o-Q1). Fig 12J shows the number of invasive tumor cells through the Q1 section at time t = 30, 40, 50, 60 h in the closed (blue) and open (yellow) cases. No migrative tumor cells through the \u2018closed\u2019 CSPG-dense loop are observed. These results illustrate the critical role of microenvironmental CSPG distribution in regulation of LAR-dependent glioma invasion. Our results also suggest the possibility of blocking aggressive tumor cell infiltration by rearrangement or injecting of a thick CSPG band on the periphery of a growing tumor, which may suppress the tumor cell infiltration by upregulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex in response to the high CSPG levels.",

            "text": "miRNAs recently emerged as one of the key regulators of cellular process such as the cell cycle [19, 116]. These miRNAs harbor a clinical significance as therapeutic components in anti-cancer therapy [117\u2013119]. AMPK and mTOR are one of master players in metabolic reprogramming in glioma [120]. Godlewski et al. [1, 22] identified a key molecular control system (miR-451, AMPK complex, and mTOR) that provides a critical switch between cell proliferation and migration. We developed a mathematical model of the core control system (miR-451-AMPK-mTOR) based on the experimental observations [1, 22] and analyzed the model\u2019s behavior in response to high and low glucose levels. The responses of the core control system for various glucose levels are in good agreement with experimental results [1, 22]: In particular, (i) the up- and down-regulation of miR-451 and mTOR in response to high and low glucose levels, respectively, and (ii) the down- and up-regulation of the AMPK complex in response to normal and low glucose. This allowed us to define the migratory and proliferative phase based on the status of these molecules and the hysteresis system generates a bistable window (Wb in Fig 3) as predicted in the previous smaller miR-451-AMPK model [59, 63]. The model system predicts oneway-, bistable-, and mono-stability switches under the perturbations of the key inhibition parameters \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 (S1 Appendix). Phenotypic changes under the perturbation of these \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 enabled us to predict the Tm/Tp-status of glioma cells in the glucose fluctuating microenvironment when specific components of the signaling system are perturbed, for example by miR-451-suppressing drugs (S1 Appendix).",

The mathematical model also predicts that the variations in inhibition of miR-451 (and mTOR) or AMPK activities (\u03b1, \u03b2) critically affect the durations of the G0 phase, thus overall cell cycle schedule, in a microenvironment where glucose levels fluctuate (Figs 5 and 6). These also imply that the microenvironment under these changes will either promote or inhibit the susceptibility of tumor cells by cell cycle-targeting drugs as well as duration of the quiescent phase (Fig 7). Many other signaling pathways such as p53, ROS, and autophagy molecules, play a role in regulation of cell cycle and overall metabolism in glioma [121]. For example, autophagy and mitochondrial dynamics influence cell cycle progression [120]. The analysis of the mathematical model in the current paper may serve as a starting point for further experimental investigation and more detailed modeling on extended key networks including PI3K/Akt [122, 123] and VEGF-independent vascularization of GBM [124].",

This type of multi-scale hybrid models [60, 61, 84, 85, 125, 126] is useful to describe detailed bio-mechanics of cells (tumor cells, microglia and astrocytes), reaction-diffusion of relevant diffusible molecules, and the corresponding intracellular signaling dynamics. Detailed biomechanical crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells (ramified/activated microglia, and astrocytes) through CSPG-induced LAR-CSGAG dynamics. Growth of the tumor cells depends not only the LAR-CSGAG signal status in the core control system but the physical constraints from the neighboring other cells, i.e., inhibition of tumor cell growth and invasion in the interior of the growing tumor mass [61, 84\u201386]. The model specifically predicts that a CSPG-rich microenvironment is highly associated with a non-invasive tumor (Fig 9B), while the absence or low level of glycosylated CSPGs promotes a diffusely infiltrative type (Fig 9A). Furthermore, the heavy CSPG chains induce upregulation of the LAR-CSGAG complex, providing a strong bond between tumor cells to the ECM (Fig 10E), and astrocyte\u2019s exodus from the dense tumor core (Fig 9D), surrounding the tumor. This strong cell-ECM adhesion and encapsulation of the tumor by accumulated astrocytes prevent tumor cells from invading the surrounding brain tissue. Absence of those two key factors in the CSPG low microenvironment (Fig 9C) triggers the aggressive infiltration of tumor cells by downregulation of the LAR-mediated adhesion (Fig 10D). These results are in good agreement with the experiments [1].",

            "text": "Reactive astrocytes, recognized as a pro-invasive component of the glioma, are reported to promote the proliferation [127] and invasion of brain tumor cells either by secreting tumor-derived connective tissue growth factors [58] and SDF-1 [128], or degradation of a preexisting ECM [129]. While the function of astroglial barriers was reported in the development and injury, the fundamental mechanism of astrocyte-induced inhibition of cellular tumor infiltration remains largely unknown [1]. It was suggested that the encapsulation of the non-invasive tumor by reactive astrocytes could provide a physical barrier to glioma infiltration [1]. Model simulations predict two distinct modes of astrocytes in response to CSPGs: (i) densely packed astrocytes, repelled by the CSPG-rich matrix, may contribute to the non-invasive characteristics of the tumor by inhibiting tumor cell infiltration on the tumor boundary; (ii) in response to a CS-GAG-deplete tumor matrix, more open, sparse field of resident astrocytes allows tumor cell invasion. Reactive astrocytes around spinal cord injury or traumatic brain form a physical barrier to promote inflammation and inhibit the spread of tissue damage in the neighborhood [130\u2013132]. In addition, the molecular agents in injury-associated astrogliotic module are likely present in the astrogliotic wall on the boundary of a non-invasive tumor type [1]. These evidences show the great complexity of the tumor-astrocyte interaction and invasive behaviors of tumor cells. These results also suggest the possibility of using the tumor-confining astrocytes for preventing tumor invasion. When this new strategy is combined with classical therapeutic agents, the overall anti-tumor efficacy may be significantly enhanced. A resection-induced injury after a image-guided surgery was reported to induce spatio-temporal alterations in the population of reactive astrocytes through changes in transcriptome and secretome within the peritumoral lesions, promoting both proliferation and invasion of tumor cells [133]. Therefore, the new anti-invasion strategies with CSPG-astrocytes need to be designed carefully to take into account the changes of these phenotypical changes in astrocytes in response to a conventional surgery.",

Our results also indicate the casual association of microglia and tumor invasion. However, the study also indicates the concurrent activation of ramified microglia with the non-invasive tumor dividing a CSPG-rich lesions and outer stroma. The activated phenotype of microglia positioned beyond the periphery of a non-invasive glioma was similar to microglia associated with injury [1], which is reported to suppress the wider spread of damage away from injury sites [135\u2013138]. Therefore, these tumor-associated microglia could be involved in a non-invasive function [1]. The microglial cells has two major subtypes, the inflammatory phenotype M1 and the M2 phenotype and this polarization of M1/M2 depends on many factors in tumor microenvironment in the pathological context [139]. Our results suggest that distinct status of ramified/activated microglia in response to the high and low levels of CSPGs may provide a bi-linear pro- or anti-invasive contributions to the tumor microenvironment (Fig 9G and 9H; Fig 10B). Further experiments and theoretical development are necessary to clarify the exact role of this dual role of microglia in the context of tumor-microglia interaction.",

This digestive enzyme was very specific to degradation of CSPGs in the context of the cell-cell adhesion. For example, Silver et al. [42] found that the formation of cell aggregation (U-87MG cell line) was not affected by other bacterial enzymes (penicillinase), but consistent monolayer growth was observed only in Chase-ABC-expressing cells. The model predicts that the non-invasive tumor in response to the high CSPG levels transits to invasive phenotype after Chase-ABC treatment by downregulating the level of the LAR-CSGAG complex, exhibiting microscopic tumor cell infiltration on the surface of the tumor mass (Fig 11A). Therefore, the critical CSPG-mediated transition (Fig 11D) between up- and down-regulation of the intracellular binding receptor plays a key role in regulation of invasive and non-invasive tumor phenotypes. The microenvironmental factors such as tissue composition and packing density, and the CSPG concentration also affect the anti-invasion efficacy due to its impact on degradation rate of CSPGs by Chase-ABC (Fig 11(G)\u201311(I)). Because of the physical constraints, Chase-ABC-mediated tumor cell invasion is limited to the outer surface of the tumor and its impact diminished toward the main tumor core. This suggest the indirect role of Chase-ABC in regulation of the invasive and non-invasive tumors [1].",

            "text": "Glycosylated CSPGs are usually distributed strategically at the particular junction areas of adjacent emerging structures [25\u201329, 31, 32]. While proteoglycans typically suppress the cell movement away from restricted regions, the fundamental nature of CSPG repulsion is poorly understood. It is a striking observation that CSPGs are uniformly distributed in non-invasive tumors [1] and these non-invasive tumor cells can thrive within the CSPG-rich environment. The overexpression of the CS-GAG receptor LAR in the non-invasive glioma population may explain a mechanism of the strong bond between the glioma cells and the ECM in this inhibitory microenvironment [1]. LARs and their CS-GAG side chains were shown to function as a adhesive agents by tethering tumor cells to proteoglycans [140]. Therefore, the LAR-mediated cell-ECM adhesion may lead to indirect but efficient cell-cell adhesion, and a non-invasive tumor lesion. The reactive astrocytes on the peritumoral microenvironment, repelled from the non-invasive tumor core by CSPGs, may also contribute to blocking tumor invasion as a secondary wall in addition to LAR-CSGAG-induced inhibition. A CSPG-rich microenvironment leads to growing gliomas with compact, non-invasive morphologies (Fig 9). So, surgical resection may be a better option to remove such compact gliomas [141]. Our simulations in the complex distribution of CSPGs show the complex invasive behaviors of tumor cells (Fig 12) in a multi-component tumor microenvironment. Our results also suggest the possibility of CSPG-astrocyte-mediated therapy for blocking aggressive tumor cell infiltration by manipulation or injecting of CSPGs on the periphery of a growing tumor, a strategy that has not yet been explored (Fig 12). Some migratory glioma cells were observed in CSPG-containing microenvironments [142, 143]. However, more and more evidences now suggest that the invasive ECM in glioma samples consists of CSPGs that do not contain CSGAG side chains [42, 144\u2013146]. In this vein, the presence of CSGAG side chain and its receptor LAR, rather than CSPG itself, in tumor microenvironment plays an important role in regulation of non-invasive and invasive glioma (Fig 13). Despite the poor understanding of LAR- and astrocyte-mediated inhibition of tumor invasion, our work shed a novel insight into better understanding of cell-ECM interaction and phenotypical characterization of non-invasive and invasive gliomas in a complex tumor microenvironment.",

Glucose withdrawal reduces miR-451 levels, resulting in up-regulation of AMPK activity and down-regulation of mTOR. This leads to reduced cell proliferation and enhanced cell motility. Normal glucose levels up-regulate miR-451, which leads to down-regulation of AMPK activity. In turn, down-regulated AMPK levels induce up-regulation of mTOR, which leads to increased proliferation and decreased cell migration. (B) Schematic components of miR-451, CAB39/LKB1/AMPK complex, and mTOR are represented by modules \u2018M\u2019 (dotted box on the left), \u2018A\u2019 (box with solid line in the middle), and \u2018R\u2019 (dotted box on the right), respectively, in our theoretical framework.

The CSPG-rich tumor microenvironment also affect the movement of astrocytes and activation of ramified microglia. Those variables in the core system and LAR-CSGAG receptor dynamics, and spatial distribution of astrocytes and microglia determine the cell fate, proliferation, dormant stage (G0 phase) or critical infiltration of a glioma cell.
