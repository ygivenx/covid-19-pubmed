Since the 1990s, a periodic vaccination strategy has been applied on pig farms nationwide to control the disease but these vaccines were not completely effective in preventing the disease, which led to a growing loss of newborn piglets in Fujian [7,8].

Its genome contains six ORFs, including pplab (pol), spike (S), membrane (M), ORF3, small membrane (sM), and nucleocapsid (N) [12,13]. The ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein and regulates virus production [14], and its loss might result in attenuation of the virus in the natural host [11]. The differentiation of ORF3 could be a marker of adaptation to cell culture and attenuation of virus [15], which could be a valuable tool to study the molecular epidemiology of PEDV [16]. The variation of field isolates of PEDV might change the genotypes and may be one of the possible reasons for the outbreaks in immunized pigs in Hebei, China [17]. Similar results were demonstrated in our primary study on field samples from 3 different swine farms in Fujian [18]. Thereby it is necessary to analyze the genetic heterogeneity of PEDV to find out which genotype prevails in Fujian. In this study, the ORF3 gene of PEDV field samples from different farms in Fujian province were cloned and sequenced for genetic diversity analysis.",

It is necessary to characterize the genetic sequence of the PEDV field samples and find out how the prevalence happened. In this study, 27 PEDV Fujian samples were identified, whose ORF3 gene sequence analysis indicated that they could be separated into two general groups. P55 with five reference strains were clustered into Group 2, which had a long length deletion in both of the nucleotide and amino acid peptide sequences. It indicated that this genotype might have prevailed in China as four strains in this group were collected from China but from different provinces (Table 1). In addition, the virulence of the virus was reduced in cell culture adaptation through the deletion mutant [15], but those five strains with the region deletion were virulent field samples, which revealed that there might be other mutations related to the virulence.",

Six Fujian strains were clustered into Group 1, which showed another genotype with unique point mutations that might be used in differentiation between PEDV groups or new DNA markers and brought potential antigenic variation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the collected Fujian strains were very distant from the vaccine development strain CV777, which might be the reason why the vaccine was inefficient in controlling the disease.
