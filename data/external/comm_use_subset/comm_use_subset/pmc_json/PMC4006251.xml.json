However, the reliability of any estimation is critically dependent on the model used, and its suitability in representing the biological phenomena related to the pathogen in question. The earliest efforts were at the beginning of the twentieth century, and concern a hypothesis that response (i.e. illness or death) occurs in an individual only if the exposed dose is greater than an innate tolerance level. Irwin [1] refers to the least dose required for response as the individual effective dose. In order to appreciate the observed variability in host response for different levels of dose, the tolerance levels of individuals are assumed to be distributed throughout a population, typically by the lognormal distribution [1,2] (i.e. the commonly referred to probit model of dose\u2013response). Other distributions can also be used\u2014for example, the Weibull distribution [3].",

For a dose of size k, the probability of response, PR, is therefore PR(k) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 phit)k. Thus, the dose\u2013response relation can be recast as the exponential distribution function,1.1with \u03b2 = \u2212log(1 \u2212 phit) (indeed \u03b2 \u2248 phit when phit is small). A crucial difference between independent action and individual effective dose is in the way in which the bacteria are perceived to interact; maximum synergism between bacteria in the latter (because the size of the dose alone dictates outcome), contrast with none in the former (because bacteria act independently).",

They therefore interpret \u03b2 through the competing risks of spore clearance (rate \u03bc) and germination (rate \u03bb) such that \u03b2 = \u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bc). It is assumed that the time from exposure to germination is exponentially distributed, giving rise to a relation equivalent to equation (1.2). But before symptoms occur, the germinated bacterium must multiply in order to produce toxins, the time for which is (also) assumed to be exponentially distributed. Thus, the final relation, PR(k, t), is given by the convolution of equation (1.2) and an exponential distribution.",

First, the host inhales a quantity of organisms all of which are transported to the extracellular space within the lung (forthwith referred to as the lung-space). Here, they are predated upon by cells of the immune system that can kill the bacteria directly (by degrading the membrane) or through a process called phagocytosis, whereby phagocytic cells (such as macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells) engulf the bacteria. However, upon phagocytosis, obligate intracellular bacteria can evade the antimicrobial defences and reproduce within the phagocyte. Following this intracellular proliferation, a phagocyte dies, releasing its contents into the lung-space. Thus, three events are possible: death (killing of bacteria) with rate \u03bc > 0, survival (phagocytosis of bacteria not resulting in bacterial death) with rate \u03b1 > 0 and birth (release of G\u2208\u2115 bacteria from a bacteria-containing phagocyte) with rate \u03bb > 0. Response is said to occur when the number of extracellular bacteria in the lung-space reaches the threshold, M. Conversely, infection is said to have resolved when the number of extracellular bacteria and bacteria-containing phagocytes both reach zero.",

In addition, a numerical solution is considered by means of discrete-event simulation (pseudo-code in figure 2). This approach serves to represent exactly the Markov model described above and provides equivalent results to the analytical approach (given, of course, a sufficient number of runs). An advantage of this is that host heterogeneity can be conveniently incorporated by sampling the threshold M from an appropriate distribution at each run of the simulation (an idea mentioned, but not adopted, in the birth\u2013death model of [23] and in the simple bacterial growth model of [24]). Incorporating host heterogeneity (individual effective dose) alongside stochasticity with respect to bacteria\u2013cell dynamics (individual action) has support from the in vivo studies [25,26], from which it is claimed that neither component of variability is alone sufficient to explain experimental results.\n",

In an in vitro study [28], human macrophages are infected with Schu S4. The authors find that at 16 h there is no evidence of cytopathogenicity and at 24 and 32 h, 8% and 25% of infected cells are unhealthy. Because cell death is governed by non-instantaneous processes [19], defining an actual time of death in such a study would not be possible. Here, the mean time until phagocyte death is taken as the time at which 50% of cells are unhealthy. However, such information is not expressly provided in [28], and so a value is estimated by fitting a distribution to the data that is available (by maximum likelihood). Because the final stages of the intracellular life cycle are poorly understood [29], the choice of distribution is not motivated by the biological mechanisms involved, but purely by goodness of fit. A lognormal distribution function (with log-mean 3.72 and log-standard deviation 0.385) is found to provide the best approximation to these data (by log-likelihood value) when evaluated alongside a gamma, Weibull and log\u2013logistic distribution. With this distribution, a median time of 41.5 h (figure 3a) is found (2.5% of cells are unhealthy by 19.5 h and 97.5% unhealthy by 88.2 h); the reciprocal of which is the birth rate, i.e. \u03bb = 0.0241 per hour.\n",

To explore this further, consider the time immediately after exposure. Here, there are no bacteria-containing phagocytes and two events can occur: death (killing of bacteria), with probability pd = \u03bc/(\u03bc + \u03b1) = 0.97, or survival (phagocytosis of bacteria not resulting in bacterial death), with probability ps = \u03b1/(\u03bc + \u03b1) = 0.03. If just one bacterium survives phagocytosis and proliferates then ultimately 358 bacteria are released back into the lung-space. To resolve infection, then all of these bacteria must be killed and this occurs with probability  (as events are independent). Hence, the survival of just one bacterium is effectively sufficient to cause illness. This can be modelled by a binomial distribution (\u00a71) which gives rise to the exponential distribution function (equation (1.1) with \u03b2 \u2248 ps). Therefore, the birth\u2013death\u2013survival model for F. tularensis can be interpreted as a single-hit-type model whereby a \u2018hit\u2019 is defined as the failed phagocytosis of a single bacterium. Note that if the threshold is fixed, say at the median Mmed = 2.4 \u00d7 1011, then an equivalent dose\u2013response relation is produced (because the probability of resolution is negligible for just 358 extracellular bacteria).",

It is claimed [5] that while the overall picture provided by the basic birth\u2013death model corresponds remarkably well to what is found in practice, the underlying interpretations are flawed and there is no experimental evidence to suggest any form of stochastic mechanism in the infection dynamics.

The underlying Markov structure of the model restricts the choice of statistical distribution in representing the occurrence of the three events\u2014birth, death and survival\u2014to those for which the Markov property holds. The simplest choice is the exponential distribution (in which events occur at random). Because of the memoryless property of this distribution, the length of time from bacterial uptake until phagocytic death is unknown, and so it is not possible to deduce the number of bacteria released on death (through equation (2.5)). Instead, an average number is used for all such instances\u2014corresponding to the average time until phagocytic death (\u00a72.2.1). But by removing this legitimate source of variability, this falsely increases the certainty of any model results. In fact, this relates to another issue\u2014the suitability of the exponential distribution in the first place. For death and survival, this choice is justified, because the movement of bacteria [49] and phagocytes [50] has similar properties to that of a random walk. However, for the time from bacterial uptake to cell death and the associated release of bacteria (birth), a simple in-cell mechanistic model (based on a pure birth process with saturation of available nutrients) suggests that the variance is being overestimated by the exponential distribution. In other areas, however, the variability may well be underestimated, because the model fails to account for variability in other sources that can affect dispersion, such as bacterial age [42], diameter [7,51], agglutination, number retained and deposition site [23].",

Instead, it is assumed that the length of time from exposure until response is insufficient for any discernible effect of the adaptive response to become apparent. However, if the adaptive response does come into effect before the time of illness, then this would, at first, reduce the growth rate of extracellular bacteria; decreasing the probability of response and increasing the incubation period of those that do respond (this is more likely to affect those with lower dose).

This supports the shorter incubation periods for monkeys (48\u201372 h) when compared with humans, and as a result only data up to 48 h are used in this study (latter times could involve illness which may indicate the transition to the adaptive response\u2014see above).

In estimating the survival and death rate (\u00a72.2.3), the deterministic solution for extracellular bacteria over time (equation (2.1)) is fitted to data from the two in vivo studies (figure 3c). These data clearly suggest an initial drop in the number of extracellular bacteria followed by exponential growth (the rate of which is lower in less virulent strains [7]). A birth\u2013death model cannot represent these characteristics (not shown, but exemplified in [23] in fitting to guinea pig plague data), but an accurate portrayal is obtained by extending this standard approach to incorporate phagocytosis. Furthermore, fitting the birth\u2013death deterministic solution only yields the net growth rate, \u03bb \u2212 \u03bc, which does not provide an explicit parametrization required to obtain the dose\u2013response relation and incubation period distribution (by either the asymptotic approaches of [14] and [15], or by the matrix-analytic approach detailed in the electronic supplementary material, A).",

            "text": "It is assumed that clinical infection occurs when some threshold number of bacteria is in the system. The triggering of symptoms is a very complex process with few data available to validate more detailed models. It is likely that the threshold will vary by individual, and it appears that a fixed threshold poorly describes the data (figure 5) at higher doses given the variability assumed in the other parameters. This is because the process is more deterministic in the higher dose range\u2014an observation consistent with the standard birth\u2013death model with host homogeneity [5,23]. On the other hand, if the threshold is lognormally distributed then, given deterministic exponential growth, the times at which the number of extracellular bacteria reach this threshold are normally distributed, as deduced for doses of 300 organisms and greater (not possible to verify from [43] owing to the recording sensitivity). This increased dispersion enables the model to capture the variability exhibited in the data for such doses. However, at lower doses, the majority of the variability is attributable to the stochastic in-host processes, so the characterization of the threshold itself plays a lesser role. This variability is caused by an initial bistability, but as the numbers of extracellular bacteria start to increase they reach a \u2018point of no return\u2019, from which the process becomes deterministic. This is supported in fitting the three-parameter lognormal distribution to low dose fixed threshold data, whereby an estimated location parameter of 3\u20134 days indicates the duration of the deterministic processes (cf. anthrax model of [47]). For the same dose range with the distributed threshold model, this and some other standard two-parameter distributions are unable to represent the skewness and kurtosis of the modelled incubation period distributions (figure 6b). In fact, the only distribution, out of those considered, that is able to do so is the (four parameter) Johnson SU family of distributions. While the gamma distribution would appear to provide the least appropriate choice, the lognormal distribution\u2014long associated with modelling incubation periods [57,58]\u2014is also clearly unsuitable.",

Also considered is the heterogeneity of individuals through a distributed threshold required for illness. For F. tularensis, this raises some interesting parallels to some of the classical dose\u2013response models. First, the infection dynamics for dose\u2013response can be simplified to the single-hit model, whereby the hit required for response is a failed phagocytosis. Second, the thresholds are found to be lognormally distributed, as in the probit model. These findings thus support the experimental evidence and postulations of [25,26] that response is a mixture of both the hypotheses of independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model). Future uses of the model considered here could include application to Coxiella burnetii (Q-fever) and L. pneumophila (Legionnaires' disease).",
