            "text": "Arteriviruses are enveloped viruses (approx. 60 nm diameter) with a 13\u201316 kb positive-sense RNA genome. The family Arteriviridae (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998; Snijder & Spaan, 2006) currently comprises four members: equine arteritis virus (EAV, the family prototype), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). The consequences of arterivirus infection can range from an asymptomatic, persistent or acute infection to abortion or lethal haemorrhagic fever (Maclachlan et al., 2007). Three of the four arteriviruses (EAV, LDV and SHFV) were first isolated and characterized approximately 50 years ago. In the late 1980s, two distantly related PRRSV genotypes, European (PRRSV-EU) and North American (PRRSV-NA), sharing a genome-wide mean nucleotide identity of only ~63 % (Allende et al., 1999; Su\u00e1rez et al., 1996), emerged simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic (Collins et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991). Since then, the virus has been causing worldwide epidemics of a previously unknown reproductive and respiratory disease and has become one of the most economically important swine diseases. Recently, a large outbreak of highly virulent PRRSV affected the Asian swine industry, causing considerable economic losses (Zhou & Yang, 2010).",

Despite striking differences in genome size and virion structure, the genome organization and expression strategy of the two groups were found to be comparable and their key replicative enzymes were postulated to share common ancestry (den Boon et al., 1991). A specific feature of their genome expression strategy is the generation of a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs to express a variety of genes from the 3\u2032-proximal region of the genome (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007). Arteriviruses and coronaviruses were united in the order Nidovirales, which was subsequently expanded by the addition of the roniviruses, toroviruses and bafiniviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006).",

            "text": "The polycistronic arterivirus genome contains at least nine known ORFs (Fig. 1a). The replicative enzymes are encoded by the 5\u2032-proximal replicase ORFs 1a and 1b, yielding two long non-structural polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, with the synthesis of the latter depending on a ribosomal frameshift near the 3\u2032 end of ORF1a. The pp1a and pp1ab precursors are processed into at least 13 mature non-structural proteins (nsps) by three or four viral proteinases encoded by ORF1a (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Fang & Snijder, 2010). In EAV, PRRSV and LDV, seven relatively small genes have been identified in the 3\u2032-proximal domain of the genome, positioned in the same relative order downstream of ORF1b (Fig. 1a). In SHFV, this region of the genome appears to contain three additional ORFs, which may have arisen from the duplication of ORFs 2\u20134 (Godeny et al., 1998) but have not been characterized in any detail. In the other arteriviruses, ORFs 2a\u20137 encode seven structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein and six envelope proteins, the glycoproteins (GP) GP2, GP3, GP4 and GP5, and the non-glycosylated envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998; Snijder & Spaan, 2006). By using reverse genetics to engineer gene knockouts, in both EAV and PRRSV the expression of each of these seven proteins was found to be critical for the production of infectious progeny (Molenkamp et al., 2000; Wissink et al., 2005). These experiments also revealed that cells transfected with mutants lacking expression of E, GP2, GP3 or GP4 release virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of RNA and the GP5, M and N proteins (Wieringa et al., 2004; Zevenhoven-Dobbe et al., 2004). Together with the earlier characterization of arterivirus particles (de Vries et al., 1992; Faaberg & Plagemann, 1995; Meulenberg et al., 1995; Snijder et al., 1999, 2003; Wieringa et al., 2004), these data indicate that the N protein and the disulphide-linked GP5\u2013M heterodimer form the structural core of the virion. The E protein and a GP2\u2013GP3\u2013GP4 heterotrimer are minor virus constituents that may play a role in receptor binding and/or virus entry (Van Breedam et al., 2010). Still, many details of arterivirus assembly, maturation and structural protein function remain to be elucidated.",

Overlapping coding sequences (CDSs) are particularly common in RNA viruses, but can be difficult to detect, especially when they are short. We have been using a number of complementary comparative computational approaches to systematically identify novel overlapping genes in RNA virus genomes (Firth & Brown, 2006; Chung et al., 2008; Firth et al., 2008; Firth & Atkins, 2009). When applied to arteriviruses, these methods detected a novel short ORF, hereafter termed ORF5a, overlapping the 5\u2032 end of the GP5 CDS in the +2 reading frame. Here, we present bioinformatic evidence and experimental verification for the functional importance of ORF5a in arteriviruses.",

It can be used to predict whether query ORFs are likely to be coding sequences via an approximate likelihood-ratio test, where the null model comprises any known CDSs and the alternative model comprises the known CDSs and the query ORF. When applied to the PRRSV-NA alignment, mlogd detected a positive coding signature for the previously defined arterivirus CDSs and also for ORF5a (Fig. 1b). In the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) PRRSV-NA reference sequence, NC_001961 (15 428 nt), ORF5a covers nucleotides 13 778\u201313 930 (51 codons) and therefore overlaps the 5\u2032 end of the GP5 CDS (nucleotides 13 788\u201314 390) by 48 codons (~24 % of the GP5 gene) in the +2 reading frame.

Incidentally, the presence of this ORF in EAV, though not its bioinformatic coding signature, had previously been noted by Pasternak et al. (2000). Since there is only a single SHFV sequence available, mlogd could not be used to test the coding potential of ORF5a in that virus. Although this analysis was based on the application of mlogd to specific ORFs, for illustrative purposes the mlogd score in a 15-codon sliding window in the +2 reading frame (with respect to ORF5) is shown in Fig. 1(b) for alignments of 127 EAV, 232 PRRSV-NA and 34 PRRSV-EU sequences (i.e. the available sequences with coverage of both ORF5 and at least 150 nt of its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 flanking sequences). Positive coding signatures are apparent for ORF5a (and also for the M and GP4 CDSs in cases where they fall in the +2 reading frame with respect to the GP5 CDS). Additional alignments were generated for 224 EAV, 8344 PRRSV-NA and 587 PRRSV-EU sequences that have full coverage of the GP5 CDS, and were analysed for conservation at synonymous sites as described in Firth & Atkins (2009) [see also Simmonds et al.

Enhanced conservation at synonymous sites is indicative of overlapping functional elements \u2013 either coding or non-coding. In all three alignments, greatly enhanced conservation was apparent in the region where ORF5a overlaps the GP5 CDS (Fig. 1b).",

When the context of the first AUG codon on a transcript is suboptimal, efficient leaky scanning to alternative downstream AUG codons can occur (Kozak, 2002). Here, neither the ORF5 nor ORF5a initiation codons have a guanine at the +4 position, but all five arterivirus ORF5 initiation codons have an adenine at the \u22123 position. In contrast, the ORF5a initiation codons have either a pyrimidine (EAV, PRRSV-NA and SHFV) or a guanine (PRRSV-EU and LDV) at the \u22123 position. Thus, in PRRSV-NA and EAV, where the ORF5a AUG codon is 5\u2032, there is the potential for efficient leaky scanning to the ORF5 initiation codon. In contrast, in PRRSV-EU, LDV and SHFV, where the ORF5a AUG is 3\u2032, conventional leaky scanning for ORF5a translation may be expected to be less efficient. However, in these sequences, the ORF5 and ORF5a AUG codons are very closely spaced (separated by just 2 or 5 nt) and it has been demonstrated that, if two AUG codons are separated by less than ~10 nt, efficient initiation may occur at the downstream AUG codon, even when the upstream AUG codon is in a strong context (Matsuda & Dreher, 2006).",

Some 10 800 sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a/ORF5 region were analysed. In contrast to the above comparative phylogenetic analyses, simply counting sequences ignores potential phylogenetic bias (some clades may be greatly over-represented relative to others; indeed; clustering the sequences with blastclust or clustal x shows this to be the case). Thus, the following analysis is more meaningful with respect to the range of features present rather than to the relative abundances of those features. Many sequences (including ~90 % of the ~9600 available PRRSV-NA sequences) cover ORF5 entirely but have no 5\u2032 flanking sequence. Therefore they do not allow analysis of the upstream ORF5a initiation codon or its context, but still allow analysis of the presence or absence of premature termination codons within the part of ORF5a that overlaps ORF5. Nonetheless 136 EAV, 445 PRRSV-NA, 622 PRRSV-EU, 1 SHFV and 5 LDV sequences have coverage of the ORF5a initiation site, and the above-mentioned initiation sites and contexts are very highly conserved (except that ~63 % of PRRSV-EU and ~9 % of PRRSV-NA sequences have a guanine instead of an adenine as the nucleotide at the \u22123 position of the ORF5 initiation codon context). Similarly, the above-mentioned ORF5a lengths are highly conserved in those sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a region, with the notable exception that PRRSV-NA exhibits two main forms of differing lengths: a 51 codon version (~26 % of sequences) and a 3\u2032-truncated 46-codon version (~74 % of sequences). A very small fraction of sequences were found to be ORF5a-defective as a result of either premature ORF5a-frame termination codons or substitutions within the ORF5a initiation codon. However, these do not necessarily represent sequences from viable viruses, but might instead be due to sequencing errors, sequencing of defective virus sequences or curation errors (e.g. five sequence records in which non-contiguous GP3 and GP5 sequences appear to have been fused in silico). Indeed, similar numbers of GP5-defective sequences were found during the analysis.",

Care was taken that the mutations introduced were translationally silent with respect to the overlapping GP4 gene (Fig. 2b). Following electroporation of in vitro-synthesized full-length RNA into BHK-21 cells, which are also susceptible to EAV infection, the phenotype of the ORF5a knockout mutants was compared with that of the wild-type control. Dual-labelling immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy for replicase (nsp3) and N protein was performed to verify comparable transfection efficiency and monitor the synthesis of genome and subgenomic mRNA7, respectively (not shown). Viral RNA synthesis in transfected cells was also analysed by Northern blot hybridization (not shown). Finally, infectivity titres in the medium of transfected cells were determined by plaque assay, both after the first cycle (18 h post-transfection) and following subsequent virus amplification in initially non-transfected BHK-21 cells.",

Much like the case of the arterivirus E and GP2 genes, whose translation is assumed to be initiated following leaky scanning of the 5\u2032-proximal domain of sg mRNA2 (Snijder et al., 1999), ORF5a and the overlapping GP5 gene are also likely to be expressed from a functionally bicistronic sg mRNA. Another striking similarity with the E\u2013GP2 gene pair (Snijder et al., 1999) is the fact that the ORF5a initiation codon precedes the GP5 gene in some arteriviruses (EAV and PRRSV-NA), but is just downstream of the ORF5 initiation codon in the others. This observation raises interesting questions about the evolution of this part of the arterivirus genome, in particular when evolving optimal sg mRNA synthesis and the expression levels of each of the viral structural proteins are taken into account. In EAV, a 10 nt segment starting with the ORF5 initiation codon can now be assumed to encode amino acids for three different proteins, GP4, the ORF5a protein and GP5, in three different reading frames, which again illustrates the pressure on RNA viruses to compress maximal coding information into a minimal sequence.",

For example, in one construct the overlap between ORF4 and ORF5 was removed to create an insertion site for foreign sequences (de Vries et al., 2000). This was achieved by using a 24 nt insertion that, fortuitously, now proves to be exactly in-frame with ORF5a, although in the ORF5a protein it introduces the substitution of Asp-12 for Ala and Tyr-15 with the sequence Cys-Glu-Leu-Lys-Gln-His-Ala-Val-His. In view of the reported wild-type phenotype of this recombinant virus (de Vries et al., 2000), this drastic change appears to be tolerated. Similarly, after passaging in cell culture 70 times, a spontaneous insertion of 12 nt into ORF5a (Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu inserted after the amino-terminal Met-Phe) of PRRSV-NA was tolerated (Han et al., 2009). In contrast, derivatives of the EAV-based vector in which the 24 nt-sequence served to insert additional foreign sequences, encoding e.g. GFP (de Vries et al., 2001) or ectodomains of other arterivirus GP5 proteins (Dobbe et al., 2001), must have suffered because of the disruption of ORF5a.

Its expression from the 3\u2032-proximal domain of the genome, and the apparent lack of an effect of ORF5a inactivation on viral RNA synthesis, would suggest that the protein is an additional virion component, and its hydrophobicity profile would place it in the virus envelope. On the other hand, knockouts of the other seven structural-protein genes were lethal to the virus, suggesting that the ORF5a protein belongs to a different functional category. Unfortunately, several attempts to raise antisera using synthetic peptides representing sequences from the non-hydrophobic domain of the EAV ORF5a protein were unsuccessful, thus obstructing our efforts to directly analyse virus particles for the presence of the ORF5a protein or analyse its subcellular localization in the infected cell. We used the SINV replicon system to express ORF5a proteins with epitope tags (haemagglutinin- or myc-tags at either the amino or carboxy terminus), but the \u03945a-2 mutant virus was no longer complemented by these fusion proteins. Finally, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of the ORF5a protein in virions by mass spectrometric analysis of purified EAV. However, a recent proteomics analysis of purified PRRSV-NA did identify several peptides from the ORF5a protein of the porcine arterivirus, and follow-up studies confirmed both the expression of the novel protein in infected cells and the production of antibodies recognizing the PRRSV ORF5a protein in infected swine (Johnson et al., 2011). Thus, the combined data now obtained for PRRSV-NA and EAV strongly suggest that the ORF5a protein is the eighth structural protein of the arterivirus particle, although more extensive studies will be required to gain detailed insight into its function in arterivirus biology.",

Arterivirus nucleotide sequences with coverage of the ORF5 region were identified by applying NCBI tblastn (Altschul et al., 1990) to the GP5 amino acid sequences from the five reference sequences shown in Fig. 2(b). In total one SHFV, five LDV, 435 EAV and 10 359 PRRSV sequences with full or partial coverage of ORF5 were retrieved. PRRSV sequences were separated into PRRSV-NA and PRRSV-EU genotypes (with respect to GP5), based on the tblastn results. Using a 76 % cut-off threshold on the tblastn \u2018maximum identity' score, all but eight of the 10 359 sequences were cleanly separated between the two genotypes. Within each group, ORF5 sequences were translated, aligned and back-translated to nucleotide sequence alignments using emboss and clustal (Rice et al., 2000; Larkin et al., 2007). Flanking nucleotide sequences, where available, were similarly extracted, aligned and combined into the alignments. Patent sequences and constructs were removed prior to analysis, and sequences annotated as defective (found by using the search terms \u2018non-functional', \u2018truncated' and \u2018defective' in GenBank records) were inspected and removed from the analyses where appropriate. mlogd statistics were calculated as described by Firth & Brown (2006). The synonymous site conservation statistic was calculated as described by Firth & Atkins (2009). Prior to these latter two analyses: (i) sequences with premature termination codons in ORF5 or ORF5a were also removed as being presumed-defective sequences (these amount to <1 % of sequences and are not obviously clustered phylogenetically), (ii) one EAV sequence with nine ambiguous nucleotide codes \u2013 indicative of poor sequence quality \u2013 was removed and (iii) since there was no shortage of PRRSV-NA sequences, PRRSV-NA sequences with any ambiguous nucleotide codes (~10 % of sequences) were removed.",

Using suitable restriction sites, the desired mutations in the ORF5a-coding sequence were transferred into EAV full-length cDNA clone pEAV515 or into pEAVrVBS, an infectious cDNA clone of the virulent Bucyrus strain of EAV (Balasuriya et al., 2007). pEAV515 is a derivative of the EAV cDNA clone pEAV030 (van Dinten et al., 1997), in which the BglII site at position 5217 in ORF1a was knocked out by using a translationally silent substitution. EAV515 virus has a wild-type phenotype, as determined by comparison with pEAV030-derived virus in growth-curve experiments and plaque assays. BHK-21 or EEC cells were electroporated with in vitro-synthesized full-length RNA transcripts of wild-type and mutant cDNA clones as described previously (van Dinten et al., 1997). For IF assays, cells were seeded on coverslips, paraformaldehyde-fixed and double labelled for EAV nsp3 and N protein as described by van der Meer et al. (1998). Analysis of revertants was done by infecting fresh BHK-21 cells with supernatant harvested at 40 and 72 h post-transfection. Total RNA was isolated after 24 h by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and the ORF5a region was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced using standard protocols.",

ORF5a slightly overlaps with the GP4 gene and largely overlaps with the GP5 gene. Small grey boxes indicate the positions of the TRS that direct sg RNA synthesis and serve as junction sequences for the 5\u2032 common leader sequence of arterivirus mRNAs. (b) Maps of the ORF5a/ORF5 region of the genomes of representative arterivirus sequences (see Fig. 2b for GenBank accession numbers). For EAV and the two PRRSV genotypes, plots are shown for several coding-potential statistics in a 15-codon sliding window. The top and middle panels illustrate the degree of conservation at synonymous sites within the GP5 CDS: the top panel depicts the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, while the middle panel depicts the absolute amount of conservation as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model. Scores below the dashed line correspond to more conserved regions and are indicative of overlapping functional elements, either coding or non-coding. Owing to the huge quantity of GP5 sequence data (8344 sequences) available for the PRRSV-NA plot, the formal P values for this analysis are extremely small for the conserved 5\u2032 region. The bottom panel depicts the mlogd coding potential score in the +2 frame (relative to the GP5 CDS). For illustrative purposes the M CDS, and the GP4 CDS in PRRSV-NA, were not included in the null-model CDS annotations so that these CDSs, like ORF5a, register positive coding potential (i.e. scores above the dashed line) in the mlogd analysis. Note that, regardless of sign (positive or negative), the mlogd signal tends to be weaker within regions of high conservation (e.g. within ORF5a) due to there being fewer substitutions with which to discriminate between the null model and the alternative model. A dashed vertical line indicates the 3\u2032 end of the common ORF5a variant (46 codons instead of 51 codons) in PRRSV-NA.",
