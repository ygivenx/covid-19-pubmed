A total of 1,413 laboratory-confirmed cases infected by MERS-CoV, including 502 deaths, had been reported globally as of August 19, 2015 [5], and mortality rate was about 35% [6]. Most cases emerged in the Middle East, sporadic cases had been reported in UK, Italy, France, Spain, United States and so on [7\u201310]. Most of these cases were confirmed after a traveling in Middle East. In the Republic of Korea, the first case was an import one having a traveling experience in Middle East [8, 11]. Due to poor pre-control measures, the number of additional confirmed cases gradually increased during the period from May 20, 2015 to June 8, 2015. Then the Korean Government took effective control measures and the number of additional confirmed cases gradually decreased during the period from June 9 to July 4 [12, 13]. Therefore, the Korean Government and WHO announced the end of MERS epidemic in the Republic of Korea in the middle of July.",

The most probable source of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is bats, and MERS-CoV-related viruses have been detected in bats. However, people have little chance to contact with them directly. It is generally considered that dromedary camels are the intermediate reservoirs for MERS-CoV transmission from bats to human, but the accurate role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV has not been available [1, 10, 14, 15]. Generally, there are two main transmission routes [4, 8, 16\u201318]: one is animal-to-human transmission, the other one is human-to-human transmission. The MERS-CoV can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The patients infected by MERS-CoV will have symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath, and the severe patients may have renal failure [1, 6, 7, 14, 19]. However, humans do not immediately show clinical symptoms after being infected and they undergo a incubation period from 2 to 14 days, during which time they are not infectious [11, 16].",

It is necessary to have a look at how the epidemic emerged and developed in the Republic of Korea [8, 20, 21]. The first laboratory-confirmed patient was reported on May 20, 2015. He is a 68 year-old male who had traveled in several countries in Middle East before flying back to the Republic of Korea on May 4. Until May 11 he showed symptoms and sought for three hospitals before he was finally confirmed and isolated. During the period from being infected to being confirmed he had a close contact with many visitors, relatives, inpatients and health care workers. The new cases continued to be reported in the next few days, and they all had corrections with the first confirmed case. Through analyzing the actual transmission process, several factors appear to have contributed to the initial spread of this virus [22]:\nThe appearance of MERS-CoV was unexpected and unfamiliar to most physicians;The practise of seeking hospitals may be a contribution factor;The control measures of the hospitals are not optimal;Multi-beds rooms in the hospitals are a contribution factor;The custom of many friends and relatives to visit the patient is also a contribution factor.\n",

When the novel disease emerged, there were no effective control measures for many reasons, in this case the basic reproduction number R\n0 = 4.42, i.e., the epidemic spread quickly. Since South Korean Government isolated or monitored all the close contacts with the patients infected by MERS-CoV, the additional confirmed cases gradually reduced and epidemic was controlled quickly. At this moment, R\nc = 0.385. After July 5, there is no additional confirmed cases reported anymore.",

Why the outbreaks of MERS are centralized from April to July and whether the outbreak of MERS has relation with season [34] are needed to be checked by more investigations.
