A large proportion of these infections have viral etiology, in particular in children. While previous studies have identified a number of viral etiologic agents, such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenzavirus, parainfluenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus, approximately 30% of all presumed viral cases fail diagnostic tests for these agents [2]. Thus, the tests are either inefficient or the causative agent is unrelated to any of the known viruses associated with respiratory infections. In fact, since 2001, several previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of the human respiratory tract, including metapneumovirus [3], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [4] and human bocavirus [5].",

We have sequenced and characterized the virome, in respiratory tract secretions from hospitalized patients, mainly infants and children, with severe lower respiratory tract infections. While many pathogens of the respiratory tract is of bacterial origin, due to chemical enrichment for virus, the bacterial sequences found in this study are likely biased and not representative for these patients. Even so, we have provided a crude characterization of the bacterial content found in these samples along with contigs of other origin. We confirmed that the lower respiratory tract was a milieu that was rich in viruses, in these patients. Many known pathogens were identified, but we also found unexpected virus families as well as one novel rhinovirus C type.",

In order to reduce the complexity of the data, putative human sequences and repetitive sequences were removed before the assembly process. This pre-processing step improved the accuracy of the assembled genomes; see Methods for a complete description of the analysis pipeline. The pre-assembly screening removed almost a 60% of the 454 reads (see Table S1) and the RNA-derived library contained fewer human and repetitive reads as compared to the DNA-derived library. This likely reflected the nature of the input genetic material, where more human and bacterial genomic DNA was carried through to the DNA pool, whereas cellular RNA contributed to a lesser extent to the RNA pools, possibly due to lower stability of cellular RNA compared to viral RNA. All remaining reads were subsequently used for de novo assembly with the MIRA assembler [12]. Assembling the sequencing reads into longer contigs significantly increased the accuracy by which sequences could be classified. Approximately 35% of the reads did not assemble into contigs but in the following discussion these singeltons will also be included in the term contig. Assembly details and statistics are described in Table S2.",

Except for the mitochondrion, which had higher coverage, the distribution across all human chromosomes was even, considering the size of each chromosome (Table S3). For the remaining 2% of the mammalian sequences, the closest homolog originated from other primates or other mammals, for example rodents. A possible explanation for this is that the human homolog has in some cases not yet been reported in public databases.

These included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are known to frequently colonize the nasopharynx of infants and children and are also common pathogens in the respiratory tract [15]. However, since chemical and physical purification for virus was employed prior to sequencing all bacterial findings are likely to be biased and are not representative for these samples. To further investigate this likely bias the bacterial content was analyzed further in regard to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or genomic origin, see Table 2.

Furthermore, alignments assigned an e-value\u22651e-5, 184 sequences, could not be reliably classified. The initial overview showed, as expected, that the main virus species that have previously been associated with LRTI (lower respiratory tract infections) in children were present in these samples. For example, families such as Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Picornaviridae constituted a large proportion of the viral sequences. Within these families several species/types were found and especially within the Picornaviridae family many divergent sequences were found, suggesting the presence of potential new types (see below). Furthermore, we also identified human bocavirus and a multitude of less common viruses, such as measles virus, circovirus and human picobirnavirus.

However, measles cases were reported during the sampling time period, and the measles sequences were most likely derived from one or more actual measles cases. In order to verify this, the sequences were compared to the MMR vaccine strain (AF266290.1). 34 out of 42 contigs (only accounting for contigs which had an alignment towards a database sequence that covered at least 100 bp) showed lower nucleotide identity compared to the vaccine strain than to other measles database entries. Six out of these 34 showed an alignment identity difference of more than 3%. All these six were alignments of more than 200 bp, among them the longest contig of 402 bp, which showed 90.7% identity to the vaccine strain while having 95% identity towards the T11wild strain (AB481087.1).

Human Rhinovirus C (HRV-C) of the Enterovirus genus is a recently discovered species that is associated with severe respiratory infections [19]. The first of the two sequences consisted of 6,858 bp in 7,671 reads thus spanning almost the entire genome. Following the guidelines recently proposed as demarcation criteria for novel types of the HRV-C species [20], [21] this genome was deposited into Genbank under the accession number JF436925 and reported to the Picornaviridae Study Group (2010-10-19). The study group has tentatively designated the provided sequence as the prototype sequence of a novel type, HRV-C35. The phylogenetic relationship between HRV-C35, other reported members of the HRV-C and representative types of the HRV-A and \u2013B species is shown in Figure 5. The second HRV-C sequence which also covered almost the entire genome (6,482 bp in 898 reads) was identical to HRV-C34 (unpublished results), which we previously extracted from these patient samples. The metagenomic sequence showed two nucleotide substitutions (A to C and W to A) when aligned to the Sanger sequenced and PCR verified sequence previously extracted and submitted as HRV-C34.",

Human picobirnaviruses are poorly studied, and nothing is known about their pathogenicity. It is not even clear whether humans or intestinal microorganisms are the hosts for these viruses. The sequence we recovered was relatively distant from previously reported picobirnavirus sequences, and its classification as a virus is not completely certain.",

The primer sequences were then removed from the amplification products by restriction enzyme digest before the amplification products were separated on an agarose gel, and fragments between approximately 400 and 1,500 bp in length were cut out and purified for use as sequencing template. This resulted in a total of 13 DNA libraries and 13 cDNA libraries, which were in turn pooled to two libraries representing the DNA content and the RNA content of the sample, respectively. The DNA and RNA-derived libraries were sequenced separately, using the 454 sequencing platform [35]. The first sequencing run was performed on a GS20 instrument and the second sequencing run was performed on the enhanced GS FLX instrument.
