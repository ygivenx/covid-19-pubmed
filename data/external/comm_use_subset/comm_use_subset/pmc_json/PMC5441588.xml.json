Infections commonly considered to cause mild or self-limiting disease in immunocompetent hosts, can lead to unusual presentations with increased severity, mortality or duration [4\u20136] and numerous community-acquired respiratory viral infections are implicated in triggering rejection episodes [7]. As a consequence, lung transplant recipients are frequently tested for a range of common respiratory viruses, bacteria and fungi [8\u201310]. Despite this rigorous testing, a considerable number of episodes of respiratory symptoms remain unresolved [11]. Successful diagnosis would, however, be important for several reasons. Specific treatment is available for most bacterial and fungal pathogens and some viruses. A rapid confirmation reduces unnecessary diagnostic steps and allows to set effective measures to restrict nosocomial transmission. Excluding potential transmissible pathogens as source of the etiology is therefore equally important as their confirmation.",

Inclusion criteria were age of at least 18 years and written informed consent. The willingness to participate in the study was notable, 83.8% of asked individuals consented. Lung transplant recipients were either included at the time of transplantation (baseline enrollment) or at the time of presentation with symptoms suggestive of an airway infection (indication enrollment). Participants enrolled at baseline had planned study visits at the time of transplantation, 4\u20136 weeks and 1 year thereafter. Drop out rate was low with 4.1%. Additional visits were scheduled, if a patient developed symptoms suggesting an airway infection. After every indication enrollment or symptom visit a follow-up visit was scheduled. At each visit, throat swabs, plasma, urine and stool samples were obtained and patients were evaluated for signs of infection and relevant transplant outcome events. An airway infection was considered if cough and/or dyspnea and/or a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were present (200 ml or 10% decrease [12, 16]). Fever alone was not considered sufficient to define an airway infection.",

For RNA amplification, a random primer with an anchor sequence (ATCGTCGTCGTAGGCTGCTCNNNNNNNN, 5 \u03bcM) [20\u201322] was used for reverse transcription (SuperScript III, Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) of 5 \u03bcl eluate, performed at 42\u00b0C for 60 min. For the DNA workflow, 5 \u03bcl of the eluate was incubated with the same random primer as in the RNA workflow at 94\u00b0C for 2 min and cooled down to 10\u00b0C for 10 min. One round of second-strand synthesis (Large Klenow Fragment, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) with 5 U/\u03bcl enzyme per reaction was performed in both workflows at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by inactivation at 75\u00b0C for 20 min. In both workflows, nucleic acids were further amplified with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher) using only the anchor primer (1 \u03bcM) and the following temperature protocol: 94\u00b0C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 40\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min; 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Finally, both workflows were pooled in equal amounts for library construction with NexteraXT (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to sequencing for 150 bp on an Illumina MiSeq with version 3 reagents and the \u201cFASTQ only\u201d workflow. Samples were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter v2.4.60. The whole sequencing procedure took about 2\u20133 working days.",

To confirm the correct identification of these viruses by our metagenomic pipeline, we performed de-novo assembly of all specific virus reads and used BLAST for aligning the resulting contigs against the full NCBI database. For all four cases of rhinovirus detection, between 2 and 11 contigs were assembled that were genotyped as expected to the corresponding Human rhinovirus A and B, respectively.

The local presence of HHV-7 is intriguing and needs to be investigated in more detail to understand its significance in lung transplant recipients. Owing to its commonly low pathogenicity, clinical manifestations of HHV-7 disease are poorly described. Seroprevalence of HHV-7 in the human population is estimated to be at 90% and the primary infection with this virus typically occurs in the first 5 years of life [39]. HHV-7 has been linked to roseola-like disease, fever or CMV disease [40, 41] and secondary reactivation of the latent reservoir of this virus can take place in solid organ transplant patients in the first weeks of immunosuppressive therapy [42], frequently in combination with detection of CMV [43\u201345].",
