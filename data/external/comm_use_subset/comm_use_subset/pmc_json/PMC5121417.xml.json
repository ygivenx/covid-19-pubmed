Alanine scanning of vaccine-surface residues likely leads to changes in the vaccine's overall immunogenicity that are too subtle to be measurable using currently available experimental methods, while deletion of a whole epitope may disturb the tertiary structure of the viral RBD. Instead, in this study we chose to mask the epitope of interest using a host-cell-derived glycan probe. This approach is effective and convenient because the glycan probe can impose steric interference for the access of antibodies and immune cells to the epitope, and also because the glycan probe is unlikely to interfere with the folding and solubility of the RBD. To place the glycan probe on an epitope, we introduced the N-linked glycosylation motif, asparagine-X-threonine (where X is any amino acid other than proline)33, onto different epitopes on viral RBD vaccines using site-directed mutagenesis.",

Four distinct epitopes on this MERS-CoV RBD fragment were selected based on their location on the RBD surface and their possible functional role in receptor binding: (i) Arg511 (located on a protruding loop and in the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region); (ii) Ala562 (located on a \u03b2-strand and in the RBM region); (iii) Val403 (located on a \u03b2-strand and in the core region); (iv) Thr579 (located on a protruding loop and in the core region) (Fig. 1a,b). On the basis of three-dimensional protrusion index map (Supplementary Fig. 2)35, the epitopes containing Arg511 and Thr579 both have a high protrusion index, whereas the epitopes containing Ala562 and Val403 both have a low protrusion index.",

Mass spectrometry revealed that the molecular weights of the mutant RBDs were \u223c1\u20132 kDa larger than that of the wild type RBD, which was also consistent with an introduced glycan probe in each of the mutant RBDs (Supplementary Fig. 3B\u2013F). For each of the purified mutant RBD samples, there was no visible presence of unglycosylated RBD on the SDS gel or the mass spectrometry spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, each of the four epitopes on MERS-CoV RBD had been successfully glycosylated.",

To this end, we used two alternative approaches. One approach was an AlphaScreen assay, which analysed the interaction between recombinant RBDs and recombinant human DPP4 in solution (Fig. 1c), and the other approach was fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which examined the interaction between recombinant RBDs and human DPP4 expressed on the Huh-7 cell-surface (Fig. 1d). The results from both assays revealed that the glycan probe located at residue 562 reduced the binding of the RBD to DPP4, the glycan probe located at residue 511 reduced the binding of the RBD to DPP4 even more, and the ones located at residues 403 and 579 had no impact on DPP4 binding. Structural analysis of the RBD/DPP4 interactions suggests that a glycan probe located at residue 511 would have serious steric clash with DPP4 binding, whereas a glycan probe located at residue 562 would have partial steric interference with DPP4 binding (Fig. 1b). Glycan probes located at residues 403 and 579 would be too far away from the receptor-binding region to have any impact on DPP4 binding. Hence, both the biochemical and structural analyses similarly elucidated the role of each of the glycan probes in the binding of the RBD to DPP4.",

We had access to four humanized mAbs (hMS-1, m336-Fab, m337-Fab, and m338-Fab). All of these mAbs were previously shown to be highly potent in neutralizing MERS-CoV infection of human cells36373839. ELISA between each of the RBDs and each of the mAbs demonstrated that the glycan probe located at residue 511 abolished the binding of the RBD to hMS-1 (Fig. 2a), reduced the binding of the RBD to m336-Fab and m337-Fab (Fig. 2b,c), and had no significant impact on the binding of the RBD to m338-Fab (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the glycan probes located at the other three residues, 403, 562 and 579, did not interfere with the binding of the RBD to any of the mAbs. The binding sites on the RBD for each of the mAbs were previously characterized through mutagenesis and/or structural studies36373839. Three of the four mAbs, hMS-1, m336-Fab and m337-Fab, bind at or near the epitope containing Arg511, whereas all of the mAbs bind away from the epitopes containing Ala562, Val403, and Thr579 (Fig. 2e). Overall, among the four selected epitopes, the epitope containing Arg511 played the most important role in the binding of neutralizing mAbs, and consequently the glycan probe covering this epitope interfered most with the binding of neutralizing mAbs.",

Compared to the wild type RBD vaccine, the RBDs containing a glycan probe at residues 579 and 511 induced significantly higher and lower neutralizing antibody titres, respectively, in mouse sera, whereas the RBDs containing a glycan probe at residues 403 and 562 failed to induce significant changes in neutralizing antibody titres in mouse sera (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table 1). Thus, masking the epitope containing Arg511 led to reduced neutralizing antibody titres in the immunized mice, demonstrating that this epitope made a positive contribution to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity. Based on the same rationale, the epitope containing Thr579 made a negative contribution and the epitopes containing Val403 and Ala562 made insignificant contributions to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity. The experiments were further repeated twice and similar results were obtained. These results provided a qualitative evaluation of the neutralizing immunogenicity for each of these epitopes.",

NII is defined as the contribution of an epitope to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity. It can be determined by masking the epitope with a glycan probe and then measuring the relative change of the vaccine's overall capacity to elicit neutralizing antibody titres (Fig. 3b). Based on this definition, we calculated the NII for each of the four epitopes on the RBD (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Table 1). The epitope containing Thr579 had an NII of \u22123.0. The negative sign of the NII suggests a negative contribution from this epitope to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity, and the value of the NII implicates that masking this epitope using a glycan probe increased the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity by three fold. Conversely, the epitope containing Arg511 had an NII of 0.6, suggesting that this epitope made a positive contribution to the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity and that masking this epitope using a glycan probe reduced the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity to 60% of that of the wild type vaccine. Therefore, the NII can serve as an effective tool to quantitatively evaluate the neutralizing immunogenicity of any epitope on the MERS-CoV RBD vaccine.",

More specifically, ELISA was carried out between a neutralizing mAb and MERS-CoV RBD in the presence of mouse serum induced by the 579-glycosylated MERS-CoV RBD (Fig. 4a,b). As a comparison, the mouse serum induced by the wild type MERS-CoV RBD was also included. Two different mAbs were used in the competition binding assay: hMs-1, which binds to the RBM epitope containing Arg511 (refs 36, 39), and m336-Fab, which binds to the RBM epitope surrounding Glu536-Asp539 (refs 37, 38). The result showed that the serum induced by the 579-glycosylated RBD inhibited the mAb-RBD binding significantly better than the serum induced by the wild type RBD, revealing enhanced neutralizing capability of the mouse serum due to the glycosylation at the 579 position. Moreover, the mouse serum induced by the 579-glycosylated RBD demonstrated enhanced binding for at least two separate neutralizing epitopes on the RBM, one surrounding Arg511 and the other Glu536-Asp539. Thus, masking an epitope on the RBD core structure with a high negative NII refocuses the host immune response on neutralizing epitopes on the RBM, leading to enhanced neutralizing immunogenicity of the RBD vaccine.",

In this study, we have developed a novel approach to measure vaccine epitopes' neutralizing immunogenicity. Using the MERS-CoV RBD as a model, we singly mask selected epitopes using host-derived glycan probes, and then measure the corresponding changes in the vaccine's overall neutralizing immunogenicity. We have also developed a method for calculating the NII for the selected epitopes. An epitope's neutralizing immunogenicity contains two parts: the neutralization capacity and immunogenicity. On the one hand, an epitope's neutralizing capacity is determined by the physical overlap of the epitope with the receptor-binding region and the potential role of the epitope in receptor binding. On the other hand, an epitope's immunogenicity is determined by its immune selfness (that is, how similar or dissimilar the viral epitope is to a host-originated epitope), protrusion, and other physical and chemical properties of the epitope. Logically, an epitope's NII is correlated with a combination of factors such as immune selfness, protrusion, potential overlap with receptor-binding region, and more. Because of the complex nature of NII, it is unlikely that the NII can be reliably predicted by software; instead, this study demonstrates that NII can be experimentally measured using the glycan probe approach.",

The results revealed that the epitopes with a high and low protrusion index tend to have an NII with a high and low absolute value, respectively. In addition, epitopes within the receptor-binding region tend to have a positive NII, and the epitopes located outside the receptor-binding region tend to have a negative NII. We cannot correlate the immune selfness of epitopes with NII because there is no good method to evaluate the immune selfness of conformational epitopes. Overall, in rational design of viral subunit vaccines, the epitopes with a high positive NII should be preserved and exposed, while those with a high negative NII should be eliminated via deletion or masking. Indeed, our study has identified an epitope containing Thr579 as one with a high negative NII on MERS-CoV RBD. Thr579 is located on a protruding loop and away from the receptor-binding region, both of which contribute to its high negative NII. Importantly, Thr579 is buried inside the full-length coronavirus spike proteins, and only becomes exposed on the surface of the recombinant MERS-CoV RBD vaccine as an outcome of subunit vaccine design (Supplementary Fig. 1). To overcome this limitation of subunit vaccine design, the newly exposed epitopes with a high negative NII need to be masked or deleted.",

This engineered vaccine effectively protected hDPP4-transgenic mice from a lethal MERS-CoV infection. Compared with the wild type RBD vaccine, mice immunized with the engineered RBD vaccine showed increased neutralizing antibody responses in their sera; when challenged by MERS-CoV, they also demonstrated higher survival rate and less weight loss. These results prove that negative epitopes should be eliminated in vaccine design. In contrast, another engineered vaccine with a positive epitope masked (that is, the epitope containing Arg511, with an NII of 0.6) showed reduced efficacy in virus challenge studies, confirming that positive epitopes should be preserved and exposed in vaccine design.

            "text": "Overall, our study contributes to viral subunit vaccine design in the following ways. First, our study introduces a new concept NII for the evaluation of how individual epitopes contribute to the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of subunit vaccines. Previous studies could not evaluate the neutralizing immunogenicity of conformational B-cell epitopes that dominate coronavirus RBD vaccines. Second, using the NII strategy our study identified an immunodominant non-neutralizing epitope on the surface of the MERS-CoV RBD core structure. This result shows that exposure of previously buried epitopes on viral subunit vaccines poses a challenge for subunit vaccine design. This concept, although needing further investigations, may be critical for the development of many viral RBD-based vaccines. Third, our study demonstrates that masking an immunodominant non-neutralizing epitope with a negative NII value on the surface of the MERS-CoV RBD core structure can shift host immune responses towards the neutralizing epitopes in the RBM region, providing means to overcome the limitation of viral subunit vaccines from vaccine design. Previous studies showed that hypervariable regions on HIV gp120 divert host immune responses and that masking these regions can shift host immune responses towards conserved neutralizing epitopes1112, providing means to overcome the limitation of viral subunit vaccines from viral evolution. Fourth, although the NII strategy was used in the current study to improve the efficacy of viral subunit vaccines, it can also be potentially helpful in other epitope-based vaccine research. For example, previous studies masked or resurfaced non-neutralizing epitopes on viral immunogens, and used the engineered immunogens as baits to screen from neutralizing sera for monoclonal antibodies that bind to conserved neutralizing epitopes43444546. It is conceivable that the NII strategy can help identify immunodominant non-neutralizing epitopes on immunogens, allowing more targeted epitope modifications for efficient antibody screening. Finally, our study suggests that a three-dimensional \u2018neutralizing immunogenicity map' (NIM) can be drawn to describe the distribution of epitopes with different neutralizing immunogenicity on the surface of viral subunit vaccines. Such an NIM can guide targeted masking of multiple strong negative epitopes, further enhancing the efficacy of viral subunit vaccines. We believe that our approach can facilitate the rational subunit vaccine design not only for coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but also for other life-threatening viruses such as HIV, influenza virus, and Ebola virus.",

Specifically, ELISA was carried out between a neutralizing mAb, hMS-1 (a) or m336-Fab (b), and MERS-CoV RBD in the presence of mouse serum induced by the 579-glycosylated MERS-CoV RBD or mouse serum induced by the wild type MERS-CoV RBD. Mouse serum induced by PBS buffer was used as a negative control. Each of the sera was serially diluted before being used in the competition assay. For each serum dilution, the % reduction in mAb-RBD binding was computed for immune-sera present relative to immune-sera absent conditions. Error bars indicate s.e.m. ***: P<0.001.",
