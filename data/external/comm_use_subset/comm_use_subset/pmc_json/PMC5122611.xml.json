The LHT Central Laboratories provide services to perform the tests in its chemical and metallographic laboratories and also according to specific standards of Lufthansa, Boeing, Airbus, American Standard Methods (ASTM), etc. They tested effects on aircraft materials such as metal, glass, electric conduits, synthetics, leather, and fabric seat covers, windows, and monitors. All disinfectants are approved by the airline engineering and can be used on the Lufthansa fleet. Gathered results deviating from common aircraft manuals, for example, the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM), are documented in the LHT Standard Practices Manual (SPM), which is mandatory for the Lufthansa fleet and, if accepted, for clients.",
