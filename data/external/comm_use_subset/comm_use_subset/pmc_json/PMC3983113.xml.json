These mosquitoes are capable of breeding in uncovered containers holding rain water, such as tires, buckets, flower pots, etc., that are commonly found in urban areas in the tropics [1]. Dengue incidence has increased 30-fold over the last 50 years, is endemic in more than 100 countries, and causes an estimated 50 million infections annually [2]. Dengue has been cited as the most important arthropod-borne viral disease of humans, with an estimated 2.5 billion people globally at risk [3]. Bhatt et al. [4] recently used a cartographic approach to estimate that there may be as many as 390 million dengue infections annually, which is more than three times the global dengue burden estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO).",

The classic presentation (called dengue fever or DF) begins with an abrupt onset of high fever, often accompanied by erythema, severe muscle and joint pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting [5]. Recovery is prolonged and marked by fatigue and depression [6]. There are four known serotypes of the virus, although the initial clinical presentations are almost identical [3]. A severe presentation, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) occurs primarily in patients who are re-infected with a different serotype [7]. DHF includes increased capillary permeability with potentially significant vascular leakage that compromises organ function and may lead to shock [2]\u2013[3], [5]\u2013[7]. Mortality in DHF has been reported as high as 10\u201320% and over 40% if shock occurs [8]. Prevention methods currently rely on vector control until such time as a specific anti-viral therapy or a licensed vaccine becomes available [9]. Therefore, public health agencies see potential benefit if a means could be found to predict dengue outbreaks with enough advance time to allow for the planning and implementation of mitigation strategies. An effective prediction model would be particularly helpful in areas where resources for such efforts are limited and in locations where medical treatment facilities may become overwhelmed by an outbreak.",

            "text": "Many published studies have described the association of different parameters with dengue outbreaks. Most of these studies have examined the environmental factors that influence mosquito vector populations [e.g.], [ 1], [10,11]. While some studies used only simulated data to develop methods for capturing seasonal forcing [e.g., 12], others used real data. In 2008, Runge-Ranzinger et al. [13] performed a systematic literature review in order to identify dengue outbreak prediction models or detection methods. One outcome of this literature review was the observation that most studies were retrospective and primarily focused on dengue outbreak detection and surveillance, rather than prediction. Furthermore, it was determined that most studies lacked an appropriate determination of sensitivity and specificity. A more recent literature review of decision support systems for the prediction, prevention, and control of vector-borne diseases was carried out in 2011 by Eisen and Eisen [14]. While the focus of this literature review was on geographic information systems and remote sensing data, it was determined that the studies reviewed provided useful risk maps, but did not provide actual predictions or forewarnings of future outbreaks. Finally, in addition to the studies evaluated in these two literature reviews, there are a variety of published methods for the surveillance and detection of an outbreak that has just begun but is not yet obvious [e.g., 15].",

            "text": "However, there seem to be fewer methods described in the literature for predicting a dengue outbreak well before it has begun (i.e., prediction). Among the latter is a study by Yu et al. [16] that analyzed climate data (including temperature, rainfall, and Southern Oscillation Index), mosquito larvae abundance, and human health data to develop a Bayesian Maximum Entropy model to predict dengue outbreaks one week in advance. Unlike most studies, Yu et al. developed their model on one set of data but tested it on a different set of data, thereby avoiding the exaggerated performance metrics that may occur when the same dataset is used for both development and testing. They found that the probabilities that a dengue outbreak actually occurred given a positive prediction and given a negative prediction were 0.5541 and 0.031, respectively. A study by Hii et al. [17] described a time series Poisson multivariate regression model to predict weekly dengue cases in Singapore using temperature, rainfall, and previous dengue incidence. After developing this model using 2000\u20132010 dengue data, it was used to predict dengue incidence during the first six weeks of 2011. They then used observed weather data and the previously predicted dengue incidences for prediction of dengue incidence during weeks 7\u201316 of 2011. A recent study by Lowe et al. [18] described using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model approach to produce probabilistic predictions of monthly dengue incidence in Brazil. It is noteworthy that, like the present study, these authors used different data for development and testing, thereby allowing for more realistic accuracy assessments.",

These techniques automatically search for relationships that may include potentially large numbers of main effects and complex interactions. Only the association rules whose metrics meet the pre-determined criteria of significance are selected, thus ensuring that variables that are not strongly correlated are excluded from the final model.",

Medical records of dengue patients from the Selangor area in Malaysia served as the data source for this approach. Their classifiers did not predict area outbreaks for dengue but instead predicted whether or not a patient was a repeat dengue case. Finally, Buczak et al.

To take into account the transition from NESSS to PIDSR around 2008, the dengue reporting data was evaluated for consistency over the full range of years. The data from 1993 through 2002 were deemed to be too dissimilar from the later years in terms of fields populated and reporting characteristics and were thus excluded from the study. A data quality check and discussion with the RP data providers revealed some additional reporting problems in later years.

For example, the weekly dengue incidence for the provinces of Laguna and Cebu are plotted on Figure 1. While the incidence rate is relatively stable throughout the analysis period for the Cebu province, there is a significant trend for Laguna province resulting from increased reporting in the later years. For all the RP provinces, we identified those that had significant reporting trend (often due to the fact that additional hospitals started reporting), reporting variability, data drop-offs, and inconsistencies from the time series plots. Unfortunately, there were no province-level data for confirmed dengue incidence to make reliable distinction between reporting trend and elevation of disease incidence. As a result of this analysis, it was determined that 40 out of 81 provinces had relatively robust reporting. Table 3 shows the resulting provinces that were selected for further analysis.",

Rainfall rate data derived from measurements made by the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites were obtained from the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center [32]. Typhoons, which frequently pass nearby or make landfall in the Philippines, bring heavy rainfall and high winds that may result in infrastructure damage. After storm passage, infrastructure damage and remaining stagnant pools of water may lead to increased exposure of the human population to the mosquito vector. Therefore, typhoon intensity and associated wind data were obtained from the US Naval Oceanographic Command Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JWTC) Best Track data [33]. These data consist of the entire typhoon path coordinates and times, and the maximum sustained wind speed at each storm location. The time resolution of the storm position was six hours. Using a radius of 80 km around each storm path coordinate, it was determined whether the interior of this circle intersected a Philippines province. If the intersection of this circle with land for a province was a non-empty set, the typhoon status variable was assigned a value according to the US Naval Oceanographic Command Joint Typhoon Warning Center typhoon categorization (dissipated, tropical depression, tropical storm, typhoon-1, typhoon-2, typhoon-3, typhoon-4, and typhoon-5) and the maximum sustained wind data were included in the predictor variable data.

Sixteen-day mean vegetation index data, which are measured by the MODIS instrument, were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LPDAAC) [30]. These vegetation index data include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). NDVI is closely related to photosynthetic activity, vegetation type, and landscape disturbance [35]. EVI is similar to NDVI but corrects for atmospheric effects, is more sensitive to variations in canopy structure, and provides for a higher resolution vegetation index scale in regions of dense biomass [36].",

As wind blows from high to low pressure, the strength of the pressure difference influences the strength of the wind and the wind-driven movement of the surface water. These conditions influence both regional and global weather patterns. The sign of the SOI determines whether conditions are neutral, El Ni\u00f1o, or La Ni\u00f1a, while the magnitude of the SOI indicates the strength of the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a conditions typically result in rainfall anomalies (e.g., heavy rain, drought) and temperature anomalies a few months later in regions both nearby and some considerable distance from the tropical Pacific [37]. Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA) data are also used as more local indicators of near-term future rainfall anomalies [38]. Higher sea surface temperatures (e.g., warm SSTA) result in more convection and the creation of rain-forming clouds. These clouds will be blown by the winds either away from or toward land, resulting in changes in rainfall patterns that may not be seasonal. Therefore, the SOI and SSTA data are used in order to provide leading indicators of future weather patterns that may not always be seasonal. Monthly SOI [39] and weekly SSTA data [40] are reported by the US NOAA National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center.",

After the identification of data sources for predictor variables, data are downloaded. The variables used for dengue prediction were described in the previous sections.\nModel Builder: The Model Builder is the principal part of the method and is where all the data mining elements reside. The data are pre-processed and used to find fuzzy association rules. A subset of these rules that satisfy certain criteria is then selected to create a classifier that becomes the Prediction Model.a) Data pre-processing and fuzzification: The predictor variable data are pre-processed to convert them into the desired spatio-temporal resolution, as described in detail in Buczak et al. [20]. For the Philippines, the spatial resolution is one province and the temporal resolution is one week.The data are then transformed into membership values (i.e., fuzzified) using fuzzy set theory [41]. Fuzzy membership functions are defined for each variable. As an example, four fuzzy membership functions (SMALL, MED, LARGE, VERY LARGE) for the variable Rainfall are shown in Figure 4. Fuzzification is defined as the process in which a number (e.g. rainfall value in mm) is transformed into a membership value lying between 0 and 1, thereby allowing for a smooth transition between full membership (1) and non-membership (0). The degree of membership in a set is generally considered to be the extent to which a corresponding fuzzy set applies. In Figure 4, a Rainfall of 50 mm will be transformed into two membership functions SMALL with a degree of membership 0.5 and MED, with a degree of membership 0.5.b) Rule extraction: Rule extraction from the training data is the most important part of the entire method. It is performed using Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) [42], a set of data mining methods that use a fuzzy extension of the Apriori algorithm [43] to automatically extract from data the so-called fuzzy association rules. Fuzzy association rules are of the form:where X and Y are variables, and A and B are membership functions that characterize X and Y respectively. X is called an antecedent and Y is called a consequent of the fuzzy association rule. An example of a fuzzy association rule (not used in dengue prediction) is:\nThis rule uses the linguistic term (fuzzy set) HOT for temperature, wherein temperatures of 70F, 80F, and 100F could each be considered to have a degree of membership of 0.1, 0.8, and 1, respectively, in the fuzzy set HOT. An important advantage of the fuzzy association rules is that they are easily understood by humans because of the linguistic terms that they employ (e.g., LARGE, HOT, HIGH).For the disease prediction application, the rules of interest are called fuzzy class association rules (FCARs), meaning that they have only one consequent: the class. An example of a FCAR extracted by FARM is:The above rules states that if Dengue Incidence one week ago (T-1) was HIGH and Adjacent Dengue Incidence one week ago (T-1) was HIGH and Typhoon Status three weeks ago (T-3) was NO and the week for which the prediction is made is between 30 and 33 (these numbers refer to US CDC epidemiological weeks), then the Dengue incidence will be HIGH 4 weeks from now (T+4). The terms confidence, support, and lift are metrics used in the rule selection to be described next.c) Rule selection: In order to build the classifier that will perform the final prediction, it is necessary to determine which rules, of the thousands extracted by FARM, should be used and in which sequence to use them. An automatic method is used to choose a small subset of rules that minimizes the misclassification error on the fine-tuning data set. The rule choices are based on selection criteria using the three most important metrics for fuzzy association rules: confidence, lift, and support.\nConfidence can be considered to be the conditional probability that, if the antecedents are true, then the consequent is true. A rule with confidence of 1 is always true. Support is a measure of how general a given rule is. Support can be considered to be the probability of occurrence of records with given antecedents and consequent in a particular data set. A support of 0.01 means that a given rule describes 1% of a particular data set. Lift represents the extent to which the antecedents and the consequents are not independent. The higher the lift, the more dependent the variables are. A thorough description of the rule metrics and associated equations can be found in [43], [20].The method for building the classifier is based on extensions of the method of Liu et al. [44], as described in Buczak et al. [20]. The following extensions were developed:Order all the rules first by confidence, next by lift, and finally by the number of antecedents.Weight the misclassification error. The user has the opportunity to give a much higher weight for misclassifying the cases with a small number of exemplars than with a large number of exemplars. This is related to the fact that, in the datasets used, about 96% of the data were from class LOW.The classifier is an ordered set of rules. Once new data arrive and are preprocessed, the highest ranked rule in the classifier that matches the antecedent of the rule is executed. The consequent of that single rule constitutes the prediction for the given data point. The last rule in the classifier, in addition to antecedents and consequent, has also a default class. The default class is invoked only when the input data do not fit the antecedents of any rule in the classifier. In this case, if the default class is LOW, then the prediction is LOW; if the default class is HIGH, the prediction is HIGH. The final classifier selected based on the criteria described above constitutes the Prediction Model.",

Originally, these weights were selected manually, which relied on human intuition and resulted in a tedious, reiterative process of selecting weights, building a model, and testing it on the fine-tuning data set in order to find the best classifier on the fine-tuning data set. The enhancement automates the process of accepting user-specified ranges for the weights on each class. Using this enhancement, all possible models were built and tested on the fine-tuning data set.

All rules in the classifier that match the data point are found, and each of these rules casts a vote for its consequent that is weighted by the product of the rule's confidence and the rule's fuzzy support on that data point.

For example, a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures (e.g., mosquito spraying). One consideration is whether it is more important to use a model with a high PPV or a high Sensitivity. A high PPV indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. When disease prevention and mitigation resources are limited, it is very important to have high PPV. Based on feedback from the local public health departments in Peru, there was a desire for a dengue prediction model with high PPV [20]. To reduce morbidity and mortality, public health departments also want to be able to mitigate any real outbreaks without being caught unprepared. A high Sensitivity indicates that the model predicts a high percentage of the outbreaks that actually occur. If PPV is high and Sensitivity is low, it means that when an outbreak is predicted, the probability is high that it will occur, but only a small percentage of actual outbreaks are predicted. In an attempt to illustrate these differences, the F-score [45] was introduced.",

In supervised learning, an automated classifier uses the training data set to learn about the nature of the problem. In the rule mining approach, all the rules with a support higher than the pre-defined support threshold and with a confidence higher than the pre-defined confidence threshold are extracted from the training data set and can potentially be used in the classifier. Classifiers are automatically built from subsets of these extracted rules using the training data. Candidate classifiers are scanned to pick the best classifier by minimizing a user-defined error on the fine-tuning data set (the error measures that we are maximizing are F0.5 and F3). Once the best two classifiers (optimizing the F0.5 and F3, to give more importance to PPV and Sensitivity, respectively) are selected, their performance is measured on the testing data set and reported as the classifier performance in terms of PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, and Specificity. The testing data set must be disjoint from training and fine-tuning data sets in order to provide a fair and objective indicator of the classifier performance on new/unseen data. In principle, the test error is considered to be an unbiased estimate of the true model error.

This procedure thus limits the number of rules and variables to those that are most important for the prediction. The resulting model is objective and reproducible. Past disease incidence data, along with environmental and socio-economic variables that have been shown in the literature to influence potential exposure to the virus, should provide enough information to allow a prediction of whether there is likely to be high incidence of dengue at a specific time and place in the future. This prediction model should not be confused with a detection model, as it is not designed to be used for early detection of a possible outbreak that has already begun and is not yet obvious because it is in a prodromal stage, etc. Although it may complement such detection, this method is instead designed to predict whether or not a high incidence of disease (such as that due to an outbreak) will be occurring several weeks in the future.",

The accuracy of the model depends also on the quality of the data (i.e., the higher the quality, the more accurate the model). This is especially important for the epidemiological data that may have inconsistent reporting over many years. For example, the number of cases may seem to be increasing, but this could be because cases were under-reported previously, or because disease reporting was recently improved by the addition of funding or other resources. Therefore, special care should be taken to see if such discrepancies are present in the data used to develop and fine tune the model. The data mining techniques used in this method are general in the sense that they can use any data. Provided that data of reasonable quality are available, using this method to predict high/low disease incidence for other mosquito-borne diseases is expected to provide similar performance; for example, our preliminary unpublished results for malaria appear promising. The models developed are robust and able to predict with reasonable accuracy even for those Philippine provinces that were never used in model development.",

It is also important to note that prediction accuracy was measured using data never before seen by the model. As emphasized in Lowe et al. [18], doing so provides a more rigorous and objective test of model performance. The novel method described herein showed good performance in predicting multi-week dengue incidence four to seven weeks in advance in Peru [20], and current results demonstrate that the model predicts weekly dengue incidence in Philippines provinces four weeks in advance with high accuracy. Such advance notification could provide valuable time for public health professionals and others to prepare for and employ disease mitigation strategies, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Because the effectiveness of such mitigation could be expected to increase as advances in disease prevention become available for local public health departments, this ability of predictive modeling to gain time for mitigation and consequence management planning should become more valuable.",
