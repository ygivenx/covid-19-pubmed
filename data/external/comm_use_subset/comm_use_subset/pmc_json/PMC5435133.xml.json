It enhances phagocytosis of opsonized particles together with the complement components C3b, C4b, C1q, mannose-binding lectin and ficolin-2, thereby facilitating clearance of opsonized immune complexes. In the presence of Factor I, CR1 suppresses the complement cascade by inactivating C3b and C4b [6]. CR1 comprises of 30 short complement regulator (SCR) domains, known as complement control protein repeats (CCPs). Four protein isoforms have been identified based on their molecular weight and the number of CR1 exons [3]. Groups of seven CCPs are organized into four long homologous repeats (LHRs A to D) [7,8].",

Among protozoan parasites, CR1 mediates immune adherence of intracellular Leishmania amastigotes [25] to present them to macrophages, the preferred habitat of Leishmania [26,27]. Low CR1 levels were associated with a decreased degree of opsonisation in patients with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection [28]. Among viral infections, CR1 has been shown to be a secondary receptor for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [29] and to expedite the entry of EBV into cells [30,31].

These Knops blood group polymorphisms have been found associated with various infectious diseases (Table 4). In particular, the two Knops blood group variants McCb (rs1704660G, E1590K) and Sl2 (rs1704661G, R1601G) have specific distributions among African populations, which has been related to selective pressure by malaria in Africa [36\u201342]. The substitution of lysine to glutamic acid at 1590 aa position modulates the epitope conformation and serologic reactivity due to its surface exposed feature, affecting the overall CR1 binding capacity [22]. A high frequency of the rs1704661G (Sl2) allele was observed in the African groups. The high frequency of the rs6691117G (KCAM-, I1615V) allele in Africa and India indicates that this allele, similar as the rs1704660G (McCb) and rs1704661G (Sl2) alleles, might also be subjected to selection. The presence of rs1704661G (McCb), which is almost limited to African populations, suggests that rs1704661A (Sl1) may be the ancestral allele [43]. Also a differential distribution of rs6691117A/G (KCAM+/-) variants was observed. For instance, in the Vietnamese and Brazilian groups, rs6691117A (KCAM+) is a major allele, while the variant rs6691117G (KCAM-) was observed to be the major allele in Africa. A study from India compared exon 29 CR1 variants in endemic and non-endemic populations and concluded that a differential association with falciparum malaria in regions of varying disease endemicity exists [44].
