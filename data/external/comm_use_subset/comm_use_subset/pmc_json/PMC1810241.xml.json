            "text": "Vaccinia virus (VV) is a member of the Poxviridae, which constitute a large family of enveloped DNA viruses and replicate entirely in the cytoplasm of the infected cells with a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 130\u2013300 kilo base pairs [1]. Poxviruses have a broad range of eukaryotic hosts including mammals, birds, reptiles and insects [2,3] and can grow in many cell lines in vitro. Some poxviruses are causative agents of human diseases. Variola virus caused a deadly human disease smallpox until its global eradication in 1977 [1,4,5], in which VV was used as a vaccine. Other poxviruses causing human diseases are molluscum contagiosum virus and the zoonotic monkeypox virus [6,7]. Notably, variola and monkeypox viruses are transmitted to humans by respiratory route, whereas molluscum contagiosum virus is mainly transmitted through the skin. Variola and monkeypox viruses cause systemic infections with high levels of lethality, but the details of their pathogenesis are not well-understood.",

Western Reserve (WR) strain was generated by intracerebral mouse passages, and an intranasal inoculation results in an acute infection of the lung followed by dissemination of the virus to various organs [8-11]. Intranasal infection with a low dose of WR strain induces an inflammatory infiltrate in the lung, and the virus was cleared 10 to 15 days after infection [10]; however, infection with a high dose of WR strain caused lethality, which has been used as a challenge model to study the effect of antiviral drugs, immune IgG, soluble viral proteins and other vaccine strains [9,12-20]. In one report intranasal infection with the WR strain caused pneumonia showing severe alveolar edema and acute necrotizing bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis as well as neutrophilic infiltrates in the interstitium of the lung [21]. The mechanisms of lethality in mice infected with the lethal dose of WR strain are, however, not well-understood.",

We used two VV strains; neurotropic virulent WR strain and the less virulent Wyeth strain. Although BALB/c mice are frequently used for intranasal challenge of vaccinia virus [10,22], we used the C57BL6/J strain of mouse in these experiments for two reasons. One is that most knockout mice lacking genes involved in immune responses have been made with C57BL6/J genetic background. The other is that we and one other group have characterized cellular immune responses, especially CD8+ T cell responses, to vaccinia virus in C57BL6/J mice [23,24], when this study was planned. Infection of C57BL/6J mouse with a high dose (106 p.f.u. (plaque-forming units)) of the WR strain was lethal, whereas a high dose (106 p.f.u.) of Wyeth strain and a lower dose (104 p.f.u.) of WR strain were not lethal. The WR strain replicated and produced higher titers of virus in the lung and the brain compared to the Wyeth strain. There was, however, no difference between the virus titers in brains of mice infected with the high or low dose of WR strain. Lethal infection with WR strain resulted in fewer lymphocytes and an altered phenotype of T cells in the lung compared to non-lethal infection and uninfected controls, and induced severe thymus atrophy with a marked reduction of CD4 and CD8 double positive (DP) T cells.",

Lower doses (104 p.f.u. and 103 p.f.u.) of the WR strain caused mild weight loss, and all mice survived. These mice recovered their weight after 6\u20138 days post-infection (Fig. 1A). The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of WR strain was calculated as 4.2 \u00d7 104 p.f.u., which is similar to the LD50 reported for BALB/c mouse [22].

When mouse lung endothelial cells (MLECs) were infected, only the WR strain grew (Fig. 3A,B). In another set of experiments, to reduce the influence of cell-to-cell spread eliminate the influences of cell-to-cell spread, the cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 1, and similar results were obtained (Fig. 3A,B). These results show that the WR strain replicated more efficiently in lung cells and lung endothelial cells than the Wyeth strain.",

There were no differences in the percentages of the CD3+ population (31\u201337%) of lymphocytes among the uninfected controls and lethally or non-lethally infected mice (Fig. 5B). We, however, noticed that there were two subsets of CD3-positive cells that expressed CD3 at a high level (CD3high) or intermediate level (CD3int) (Fig. 5B). Lethal-infection with the WR strain increased the proportion of CD3int up to 13.6% compared to 3.49% of the uninfected control group (Fig. 5B). Non-lethal infection with WR and Wyeth did not induce a significant increase of this subset (Fig. 5B). CD4 expression in the CD3int cells was higher than in the CD3high cells (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the majority of the CD3int cells were CD4high CD8- cells, whereas CD3high cells consisted of CD4int CD8- and CD4- CD8+ cells (Fig. 5C). As the result, a proportion of CD3int CD4high CD8- lymphocytes markedly increased in lethal-infection with the WR strain (23.5%) compared to uninfected controls (4.4%) at 5 days post-infection (Fig. 5D).",

We used isoflurane to anesthetize mice before intranasal inoculation for consistent administration of the inoculum into the airway. Isoflurane is known to inhibit interferon stimulation of NK cells in mice [26,27]. It was also reported that mean white blood cell counts in circulation decreased in mice after exposure to isoflurane anesthesia [28]. In our experiments uninfected control mice were also anesthetized with isoflurane before inoculation of CV-1 cell lysate. Therefore, we interpret the observed decrease of the number of T cells and NK cells in the lung of lethally infected mice (when compared to uninfected controls and non-lethal infections) is due to viral infection, although synergistic effect of viral infection and isoflurane cannot be ruled out.",

These data suggest that lethal infection with the WR strain by the respiratory route induces immune suppression, resulting in uncontrolled virus replication in the lung. Innate immune responses are likely to be very important to limit virus replication in the lung in the early phase of the infection (1\u20133 days post-infection) for subsequent recovery from VV infection. In the absence of effective early immune responses, the mice infected with a high dose of WR do not develop effective adaptive immune responses and the high viral burden suppresses the T cell responses in the lungs and causes severe thymic atrophy.",

This replication pattern is similar to infection with paramyxoviruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), in which virus titers in the lung peak at 4\u20135 days post-infection [29-31]. In contrast, other respiratory viruses, such as influenza and SARS viruses, rapidly replicate in the lung after intranasal infection and the virus titers reached a peak at 1\u20132 days post-infection [32-34]. Although RSV has direct cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium, host immune responses are more important factors in disease pathogenesis [35]. In lethal intranasal infection with VV, in contrast, there is a marked decrease in lymphocytes in the lung. T cells are key effectors of virus clearance in mice infected with various viruses via respiratory route [36]. Immune suppression of T cells is considered to be an immune evasion strategy, observed in several respiratory virus infections. For example, PVM and RSV suppressed T cell effecter functions in the lung [37,38]. Adenovirus infection induced T cells with decreased proliferative ability in the lung and local immunoincompetence by altering DC-T-cell interaction [39]. Infection with highly virulent influenza A strains down-regulated CD8+ T cell responses [33]. Since VV has many immunomodulatory proteins [40-42], it is not surprising that high levels of WR VV induced immune suppression in the infected lungs.",

            "text": "We observed that intranasal VV infection induced severe thymus atrophy (Fig. 7). Severe atrophy of the thymus is seen in several infections [43] including acute viral infections, such as rabies [44,45], measles [46,47], mouse hepatitis [48], and Ebola viruses [49]. Although inoculation of ectromelia virus into the food-pad of BALB/c mouse is known to cause the necrosis of thymus as well as other lymphatic tissues [50], there has been no description of thymus atrophy in mice induced by respiratory infection with VV. It is not known whether RSV, PVM, adenovirus and influenza A virus cause thymus atrophy when immune suppression of T cells is observed in the lung. The atrophy of the thymus was mainly due to a reduction of immature CD4+CD8+ DP. One major consideration regarding thymus atrophy is a rise of glucocorticoid hormone level in the blood, which is induced due to the stress responses to severe infections [43,44,51,52]. CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes are particularly sensitive to glucocorticoids. In addition, some cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, may also contribute to the thymus atrophy in some infections [48,53]. It also has been suggested that infection of the cells in thymus is involved in reducing the number of thymocytes [43,46-48,54,55]. In measles and mouse hepatitis virus infections apoptotic depletion of thymocytes is mediated by the infection of thymic epithelial cells [46-48]. In Trypanosoma cruzi infection parasite-derived factors are involved in apoptosis of thymocytes [43,54,55]. VV has been found to synthesize steroid hormones with a 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase encoded by gene A44L [56]. We did not perform experiments dissecting the mechanisms of the thymus atrophy induced by intranasal VV infection in the lethal infection. However, virus was recovered from the thymus when the thymocyte number was markedly decreasing at days 3 and 5 post-infection in the lethal infection (Fig. 7B and 7C), suggesting that the steroid hormone synthesized by both virus and host may contribute to thymus atrophy as well as the direct effect of virus infection against thymic cells. The VV A44L gene is well conserved among VV strains. In contrast, virus was under the detection limit in the thymi of mice infected with a non-lethal dose of WR when the thymocyte number was at nadir at day 10 post-infection (Fig. 7B and 7C). Further investigation is required to uncover the mechanisms of thymus atrophy induced by respiratory infection with VV. At this point it appears that acute thymus atrophy early in infection may be a component of the lethal outcome.",

The size of the virus plaques and the ability to form comets were also different between these two strains (Fig. 4A). In addition, the Wyeth strain induced syncytium formation in infected cells, but the WR strain did not (Fig. 4B). Usually cell-cell fusion is not apparent during VV infection in cultured cells, but it appears spontaneously with certain mutants or can be triggered by briefly lowering the pH [57]. These differences suggest different host-virus interactions in infected lung cells, and in the case of WR infection, a high dose of virus resulted in uncontrolled replication of the virus in the lung. It has been reported that the hemagglutin and serine protease inhibitor 3 are fusion inhibitor proteins and mutants containing a disruption of these proteins form syncytia at neutral pH [58-62]. We did not analyze nucleotide differences between WR and Wyeth strains, since the Wyeth strain is not cloned and is genetically heterogeneous, which recent sequencing data of Dryvax (derived from the same New York City Board of Health strain) confirmed (GenBank accession numbers DQ377945, AY313847, AY313848).",

Murine models of respiratory infection with several viruses have been provided useful information about acute and chronic virus respiratory infection, humoral and cellular immune responses, CD4 and CD8 T cell biology, and innate immune responses. We think that VV respiratory infection of the mouse is a useful model not only to understand the pathogeneses of poxviruses but also other respiratory viruses.",
