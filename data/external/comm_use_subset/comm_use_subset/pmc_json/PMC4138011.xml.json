            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that is very often difficult to diagnose. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that during 2012 the global case detection rate for TB was 66%, suggesting that of the estimated 8.6 million incident cases that year almost 3 million cases were not diagnosed and notified [1]. Pulmonary TB, the most infectious form of the disease, is diagnosed by detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) bacilli in samples of sputum expectorated by the patient. Smear microscopy, which is the primary test used for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB endemic countries [1], is a laborious and relatively insensitive test with a case detection rate of only 56 to 68% [2]. While microscopy can diagnose late stage TB disease, it performs poorly on specimens acquired from cases with HIV co-infection due to the reduced numbers of TB cells produced in a sputum specimen. Failure to detect and treat pulmonary disease in a timely manner results in onward transmission and the continuation of the epidemic which claimed an estimated 1.2 million lives during 2012 [1]. The WHO recently noted that in 2012 approximately three million cases of active TB went undiagnosed by country programs [1] and there is a pressing need for improved diagnostic tools to supplant smear microscopy to facilitate rapid detection [3], [4].",

This polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test is fully integrated into a modular system and can detect both TB infection and indicate the presence of resistance to one of the key anti-tuberculosis drugs, rifampicin. The key attribute of the GeneXpert system is its ease of use, as the majority of key processes are integrated and automated from DNA extraction to interpretation of a test result [6]. However, the GeneXpert requires consistent electricity and laboratory temperatures maintained under 30\u00b0C, which poses logistical challenges [7]. Furthermore, the cost of cartridges, instrumentation and maintenance threaten its sustainability in the longer term in high TB burden countries that currently rely on global donor assistance to provide this technology. Therefore, to increase access to timely and accurate diagnosis for more TB suspected patients, rapid, high performance TB diagnostic tests that can meet the logistical challenges of unsupervised use in limited infrastructure settings are required and at a price that is more comparable to smear microscopy [3], [8]\u2013[10]. Other technologies have been developed for TB diagnosis in microscopy centers in high burden countries and are currently undergoing evaluation. These include semi-modular systems (Epistem Genedrive and Molbio EASYNAT) or methods with manual specimen processing and test determination (Eiken LoopAMP TB and Ustar Biotechnologies Easy NAT) [9], [11]\u2013[15].",

            "text": "Recently, isothermal amplification assays utilizing loop mediated amplification (LAMP), helicase dependant amplification (HDA) and cross priming amplification (CPA) have been described for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB [12], [16], [17]. Unlike PCR, isothermal assays do not require precisely controlled thermal cycling and instead use only a uniform incubation temperature, typically 55\u201365\u00b0C, to permit DNA amplification and therefore may offer greater utility with more simplistic reactor designs or heat sources [12], [18]\u2013[20]. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) has emerged as a novel, isothermal technology for use in molecular diagnosis of infectious disease [21]. Unlike many other isothermal technologies, RPA does not require elevated or precise temperatures, and may proceed at temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C [21]. RPA replaces the thermal cycling needed for PCR with three core enzymes. The titular enzyme, a recombinase, binds to oligonucleotide primers to form recombination filaments that can recombine with homologous DNA (Figure 1). The second enzyme, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, binds to the strand of DNA displaced by the primer, stabilising the D-loop that has formed and preventing the dissociation of the primer. The third core enzyme is a strand-displacing DNA polymerase that copies the DNA template by adding bases onto the 3\u2032 end of the primer, forcing open the DNA double helix as it progresses. As with PCR, the use of closely spaced opposing primers allows the exponential amplification of a defined region of DNA. RPA reactions typically run to completion in 5\u201315 minutes, depending on amplicon size and the template copy number [21]. This time to test result is significantly more rapid than the other isothermal MTBC assays which note incubation times in the range of 45\u201360 minutes [12], [13], [16].",

This abasic site is recognised and cleaved by several types of endo- or exonucleases, but only when the probe has bound to its complementary sequence. Different nucleases are specifically added to the core RPA reaction mixture for use in a variety of detection formats, including fluorescence detection in real time or endpoint detection via a lateral flow strip [21], [22]. Reverse transcriptase, can be also included in RPA reactions to facilitate RPA from RNA targets such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus or Rift Valley Fever [23], [24]. Recently RPA was been demonstrated to be highly sensitive for the detection of HIV proviral DNA [22] and in this work we have investigated the use of RPA to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA from patients presenting with suspected pulmonary TB.",

            "text": "An RPA assay was designed to target the insertion sequence, IS6110\n[29], [30], a region that has been shown to have high sensitivity for diagnosing tuberculosis using PCR [31], [32]. IS6110 is often present in M. tuberculosis in multiple copies of up to 25 per genome [33] but conversely MTBC isolates with no IS6110 target have also been described [34], [35]. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) strains have a low number of IS6110 copies, the Bulgarian BCG strain used in this study having two copies [36]. To ensure coverage of all MTBC species, an second RPA assay for the insertion sequence IS1081 was also developed [37]. Unlike IS6110, IS1081 is present in all MTBC species and at a more stable copy number of 5\u20137 repeats per genome [38], the Bulgarian BCG strain used in this study having six copies. The primers and probes for both the IS6110 and IS1081 assays were selected based upon sequences described for the MTB H37Rv whole genome (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000962.3 [39]) and M. bovis BCG [37]. All initial designs were then screened using BLASTN and the NCBI nucleotide database to ensure the target sequences for the primers and probes were exclusive to MTBC species only [40]. The only difference between RPA primers and PCR primers is one of length, with 30\u201338 base oligonucleotides being optimal for the formation of efficient recombinase filaments. TwistAmp exo probes are oligonucleotides that are typically 46\u201352 bases long, with a tetra-hydrofuran (THF, sometimes referred to as a dSpacer) creating an abasic site in the oligonucleotide probe sequence [21]. The THF is positioned \u226530 bases from the 5\u2032 end and \u226515 bases from the 3\u2032 end. A fluorophore and a quencher are positioned on either side of the THF moiety, typically 2\u20134 bases apart. The only commercially available labelled phosphoramidite bases are dT and so the location of T nucleosides dictates the precise location of probes. The 3\u2032 ends of each probe are blocked with a C3-spacer to prevent DNA polymerase extension from undigested probes. However, after exonuclease III digestion at the abasic site within the Exo probe, the newly generated 3\u2032 end of the larger portion of the cleaved probe has a hydroxyl group from which DNA polymerase mediated strand extension can then occur.",

The time to onset of a rise in fluorescence increased as the amount of BCG genomic DNA in the sample decreased. When using IS6110 primers, 6.25 fg per 100 \u00b5L reaction were required for reactions to be consistently positive, which is approximately equivalent to the DNA found in a single bacteria (n = 9). As shown in figure 2b, when testing low levels of DNA the time to onset of fluorescence was associated with the amount of DNA in the samples, with 11 min being required when testing 5 fg. When using IS1081 primers consistent positive results were obtained for all samples containing at least 20 fg BCG genomic DNA (Table 3). The time to onset of signal at the lowest concentration of 20 fg ranged from 7 to 9 minutes. These results suggested that either RPA assay is highly sensitive for the rapid amplification and detection of MTBC DNA, and that a 15 minute data collection period is sufficient to detect positive samples. Sensitivity was also assessed by testing replicate serial dilutions of a culture of BCG. Results (not shown) indicated that both RPA assays were capable of detecting a single colony forming unit of bacteria.",

Two assays targeting separate repetitive elements were examined, both demonstrating the ability to detect MTBC DNA with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity in less than 20 minutes. Of the two assays the IS6110 RPA consistently detected \u223c6.5 fg of genomic DNA, and thus could detect samples estimated to contain the genome equivalent of a single bacterial cell. The IS1081 assay required slightly higher amounts of DNA 20 fg, which was not expected as it does not reflect the increased number of copies of this insertion element in the genome (six IS1081 vs two IS6110). We suspect the lower sensitivity observed is due to reduced primer and probe binding efficiency of the oligonucleotides screened in this study. We also cannot rule out the possibility of localized secondary or tertiary DNA structures affecting the recombinase mediated insertion of the oligonucleotides despite the presence of high levels of ssDNA binding protein in RPA reactions. Nonetheless both assays demonstrated the potential of RPA as a diagnostic tool to detect tuberculosis in samples containing low numbers of bacteria. Both assays were shown to be highly specific for MTBC (100%) when challenged with acid fast bacterial species that do not cause tuberculosis or 18 other common commensal or respiratory bacterial pathogens.",

It should be noted a crude DNA extraction procedure was used and improved sample handling and DNA extraction may improve detection from complex sample matrixes such as sputum [42]. Similarly whereas 0.5 ml inoculums were used for culture the volume taken for DNA extraction was only 0.25 ml, with just 5 \u00b5L being used for each RPA assay and there may be opportunity to improve sensitivity by testing larger sample volumes or by incorporating a sample concentration step.
