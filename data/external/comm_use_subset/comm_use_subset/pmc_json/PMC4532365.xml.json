            "text": "Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a 15 kDa protein that restricts cellular infection by influenza virus [1,2,3]. IFITM3 is active against all strains of influenza virus that have been tested to date, regardless of serotype or species of origin [1,3,4,5,6], and it similarly inhibits many other medically important viruses such as HIV, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus [1,5,7,8,9]. Confirming its importance in vivo, IFITM3 knockout mice succumb to sublethal doses of influenza virus [10,11]. Likewise, IFITM3 is the only known protein for which a genetic polymorphism present in a significant percentage of the human population is associated with severe influenza virus infections [10,12,13,14]. In the cell, IFITM3 localizes to endosomes and lysosomes [15,16,17], and traps endocytosed virus particles within these degradative compartments by impeding the formation of the virus fusion pore [16,18,19]. Yet, even with this potent mechanism by which IFITM3 limits infections, influenza virus remains a significant health concern [20,21]. This may be explained by the fact that IFITM3 is present at low levels within most cells at steady state and is induced by IFNs only after infection has already been established [3,11,22]. The inability to up-regulate IFITM3 levels independently of infection or IFNs is a challenge preventing the field from harnessing the activity of IFITM3 for infection prevention.",

A non-ubiquitinated lysine-to-alanine mutant of IFITM3 possessed enhanced antiviral activity and a longer half-life as compared to WT IFITM3 [15]. These findings indicated that inhibition of IFITM3 ubiquitination could augment the activity and/or levels of endogenous IFITM3, thus offering a strategy for exploiting IFITM3 therapeutically or prophylactically against viral infections. The identification of the E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) capable of modifying IFITM3 among the more than 600 annotated E3 ligases in the human genome will be an important step toward validating this antiviral strategy.",

            "text": "Through our work studying tyrosine phosphorylation of IFITM3, we discovered that phosphorylation at tyrosine 20 (Y20) inhibited IFITM3 ubiquitination [23]. This led us to posit that phosphorylation of Y20 may block an E3 ubiquitin ligase recognition signal. Indeed, Y20 is part of a highly conserved PPxY motif (where P = proline, x = any amino acid, and Y = tyrosine, Fig 1A)[24]. PPxY motifs are commonly recognized by WW (characterized by two tryptophan residues spaced approximately 20 amino acids apart) domains of NEDD4-family E3 ubiquitin ligases, of which there are nine family members [25]. We chose to focus first on NEDD4, the prototypical member of this family, for several reasons: 1) NEDD4 and IFITM3 both have ubiquitous expression patterns while several other NEDD4-family members are tissue-specific (BioGPS.org [26]), 2) Like IFITM3, many of the known NEDD4 substrates are membrane proteins and are associated with endosomal and lysosomal pathways [25,27], 3) IFITM3 and NEDD4 are both S-palmitoylated, suggesting that they may localize to similar membrane subdomains [2,28], and 4) NEDD4 is reported to be inhibited by ISG15 [29,30,31], an IFN-inducible protein, thus providing an intriguing model whereby IFN might induce IFITM3 expression while also inhibiting its ubiquitination. Herein, we provide results demonstrating the ability of NEDD4 to ubiquitinate IFITM3 and identify a unique role for NEDD4 in decreasing steady state IFITM3 abundance, leading to increased cellular susceptibility to influenza virus infection.",

By performing immunofluorescence microscopy imaging of endogenous IFITM3 and NEDD4, we detected co-localization of these two proteins (Fig 1B). Further co-localization of these proteins with endogenous LAMP1, a lysosomal marker, indicates that NEDD4 and IFITM3 may interact at lysosomes (Fig 1B).",

On the contrary, no increase in IFITM3 ubiquitination was seen upon overexpression of HA-tagged human CBL-B, another E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been reported to interact with NEDD4 [32], and that is associated with regulation of immune responses [33] (Fig 1C). Additionally, we examined the effect of overexpressing FLAG-tagged human NEDD4 (FLAG-NEDD4) on IFITM3 ubiquitination in comparison to FLAG-tagged human SMURF1 and SMURF2 (FLAG-SMURF1 and FLAG-SMURF2), both of which are members of the NEDD4-family of ubiquitin ligases. FLAG-NEDD4 caused an increase in IFITM3 ubiquitination while FLAG-SMURF1 and FLAG-SMURF2 were unable to robustly modify IFITM3 (Fig 1D). These results demonstrate that NEDD4 possesses a degree of specificity for IFITM3 that is lacking for CBL-B and the NEDD4-family members, SMURF1 and SMURF2.",

NEDD4 has four WW domains and IFITM3 contains a highly conserved PPxY motif within its N-terminus (Fig 1A). To test whether these domains are required for IFITM3 ubiquitination, we generated an IFITM3 mutant in which each residue of the PPxY motif (17-PPNY-20 in IFITM3) was mutated to alanine (designated 17-20A) and utilized a FLAG-NEDD4 mutant in which its four WW domains were deleted (designated \u0394WW). Upon co-overexpression of FLAG-NEDD4 with myc-hIFITM3, ubiquitination of IFITM3 was increased as expected, while the \u0394WW mutant was unable to increase IFITM3 ubiquitination (Fig 1E). In fact, FLAG-NEDD4-\u0394WW partially decreased steady state IFITM3 ubiquitination, perhaps indicating a dominant negative effect (Fig 1E). Moreover, the 17-20A mutant of IFITM3 showed less ubiquitination than WT IFITM3 and was unaffected by overexpression of NEDD4 (Fig 1E).",

Thus, in order to be certain that the results we observed for the 17-20A mutant of IFITM3 was not because of interference with the Yxx\u03a6 motif, we tested additional PPxY mutants in which the two prolines were mutated to alanine (myc-hIFITM3-P17,18A) or in which the tyrosine was mutated to alanine (myc-hIFITM3-Y20A). Upon co-overexpression of FLAG-NEDD4, the ubiquitination of both of these mutants was only minimally increased as compared to the robust increase in ubiquitination of WT IFITM3 (Fig 2A). Interestingly, a truncated form of IFITM3 missing its first 21 amino acids, including the PPxY motif, is prevalent in certain human populations. This variant is associated with severe influenza virus infections [10,13,14] and more rapid progression of HIV-related disease [37]. A myc-hIFITM3 construct lacking these first 21 amino acids (\u03941\u201321) was, as expected, largely unaffected in terms of ubiquitination by overexpression of FLAG-NEDD4 (Fig 2B), identifying a potentially important difference between the truncated and full-length IFITM3 proteins.",

We therefore tested the ability of purified NEDD4 to ubiquitinate immunoprecipitated IFITM3 in vitro in order to confirm that NEDD4 can directly modify IFITM3. HA-hIFITM3 was incubated with purified NEDD4, enzymatic cofactors, and ubiquitin. We then re-immunoprecipitated IFITM3 and subjected it to anti-ubiquitin western blotting. Our results show that NEDD4 is capable of robustly ubiquitinating IFITM3 in vitro (Fig 4). Additionally, we employed ubiquitin mutants that could only be added via lysine 48 (K48) or lysine 63 (K63) linkages in order to examine whether NEDD4 preferentially utilizes one of these polyubiquitination linkages for modifying IFITM3. While both K48 and K63 linkages could be added to IFITM3 by NEDD4, we observed a preference for the K48 linkage in long polyubiquitin chains, which is traditionally associated with protein degradation (Fig 4). These results are consistent with our past results using linkage-specific anti-ubiquitin antibodies, which demonstrated that while both K48 and K63 ubiquitin linkages could be detected on IFITM3, K48 linkages are more prevalent [15]. These data are also consistent with our previous results indicating that ubiquitination of IFITM3 promotes its turnover [15].",

We also utilized KO MEFs reconstituted with NEDD4 via retroviral transduction. Remarkably, Western blotting of lysates from NEDD4 KO cells showed an increase in steady state IFITM3 levels as compared to WT cells, while NEDD4 reconstitution decreased IFITM3 to WT levels (Fig 5A). To examine the requirement for NEDD4 in ubiquitinating IFITM3, we immunoprecipitated IFITM3 from large quantities of lysate from both WT and KO cells, expecting that the immunoprecipitation reagents would be saturated, thus providing us with comparable amounts of IFITM3 for examination of ubiquitination. Indeed, IFITM3 from NEDD4 KO cells was ubiquitinated much less than IFITM3 from WT cells (Fig 5B). These results demonstrate that NEDD4 is required for proper steady state ubiquitination of IFITM3, and that the absence of NEDD4 results in cellular accumulation of unmodified IFITM3.",

We observed that NEDD4 KO MEFs were in fact significantly less susceptible to infections with influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 (PR8 and X-31 strains, respectively) compared to WT control cells (Fig 5C). The decreased susceptibility of KO cells was returned to WT levels of infection upon NEDD4 reconstitution (Fig 5C). We also verified that the enhanced resistance of NEDD4 KO cells to influenza virus infection included resistance to recently circulating strains. NEDD4 KO cells were significantly less susceptible than WT cells to infection by both influenza B virus (IBV) and IAV H3N2 strains isolated in 2011 (Fig 5D). We also examined retrovirus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein, which is also reported to be inhibited by IFITM3 [3,35,36,39,40]. As expected, the percent of NEDD4 KO cells infected with VSV G-pseudotyped virus was significantly less than WT cells (Fig 5D). Sendai virus (SeV), a parainfluenza virus that primarily fuses at the cell surface [41] and is thus only minimally affected by IFITM3 [4], was also tested. Unlike IAV, IBV, and VSV G-pseudotyped retrovirus, SeV was not appreciably affected by NEDD4 KO (Fig 5D). Thus, the pattern of virus restriction we observed is consistent with protection of NEDD4 KO cells by IFITM3.",

Importantly, we found that the relationship between NEDD4 knockdown and increased IFITM3 levels was preserved in two additional human lung cell lines (Fig 7D). Taken together with experiments presented in Figs 3, 5 and 6, these data confirm an evolutionary conservation between mice and humans in the regulation of cellular IFITM3 levels by NEDD4.

Since NEDD4 is known to associate with the endosomal and lysosomal system and to target several of its substrates for lysosomal degradation [25], our results identifying NEDD4 as the primary ubiquitin ligase for IFITM3 would suggest that IFITM3 is degraded in lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, we utilized chloroquine and bafilomycin, which inhibit endosomal and lysosomal acidification and thus the activation of pH-dependent lysosomal proteases. We observed that treatment of A549 lung cells with these two inhibitors caused an accumulation of IFITM3 (Fig 7E). Similarly, treatment with leupeptin, an inhibitor of specific lysosomal proteases resulted in a similar increase in IFITM3 levels (Fig 7E). This is in contrast to the treatment of cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, which consistently caused a modest decrease in IFITM3 levels, perhaps due to up-regulation of lysosomal degradation pathways when proteasome activity is inhibited. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that, consistent with the co-localization of IFITM3 and NEDD4 at lysosomes (Fig 1B), and the ubiquitination of IFITM3 by NEDD4 (Figs 1C, 1D and 1E, 2,3,4 and 5B), IFITM3 is turned over by the lysosomal degradation pathway.",

            "text": "An additional intriguing aspect of our finding that IFITM3 steady state levels are regulated by NEDD4 is the previously described role of the IFN effector ISG15 in inhibiting NEDD4 [29,30]. ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein that specifically binds to NEDD4, blocking its productive interaction with Ubiquitin-E2 ligase complexes [29,30]. The importance of this pathway was highlighted by two independent studies demonstrating that ISG15 blocks NEDD4-mediated monoubiquitination of the VP40 matrix protein of Ebola virus, thereby inhibiting the budding of Ebola virus-like particles [29,30]. Importantly, several studies have implicated ISG15 as a critical antiviral effector against IAV and IBV [42,43,44]. Two studies have demonstrated conjugation of ISG15 onto the IAV NS1 protein by the E3 ligase HERC5, and found that ISGylation of IAV NS1 antagonizes virus replication [44,45]. Interestingly, IBV NS1 specifically blocks human ISG15 conjugation by preventing ISG15 interaction with the ISG15 activating enzyme UbE1L, effectively counteracting its antiviral effect [43,46,47,48]. We posit that high levels of IFITM3 attained after IFN stimulation result from both IFITM3 gene induction, as well as increased IFITM3 protein stability as a result of ISG15 inhibition of NEDD4. We are currently investigating this exciting potential synergistic link between ISG15 and IFITM3.",

However, our results would also suggest that additional ubiquitin ligases are also able to modify IFITM3, particularly when IFITM3 is present at high levels. This is supported by detection of partial ubiquitination of our various IFITM3-PPxY mutants (Figs 1E and 2A and 2B) and by detection of modest IFITM3 ubiquitination in NEDD4 KO cells (Fig 5B). The identities of secondary ubiquitin ligases for IFITM3 are still unknown. Of particular interest are the ubiquitin ligases capable of modifying the truncated \u03941\u201321 splice variant of human IFITM3, which was not significantly ubiquitinated by NEDD4 (Fig 2B). Identifying the ubiquitin ligases that modify this disease-associated variant may implicate crucial differences in the stability and degradative pathways potentially underlying the defect possessed by this protein. Nonetheless, our data clearly implicate NEDD4 as the primary E3 ubiquitin ligase for IFITM3, and demonstrate that NEDD4 is essential for maintaining low steady state IFITM3 levels.",

Additionally, our experiences studying IFITM3 ubiquitination here and in our prior work suggest that when examining overexpressed IFITM3 constructs, ubiquitination has only subtle effects on total protein levels detected by Western blotting despite significant effects on the IFITM3 half-life13,20. Thus, overexpression likely masked any effects of mutating the PPxY motif on the parameters previously tested [36].",

            "text": "Our study has uncovered a novel mechanism by which NEDD4 indirectly promotes cellular entry of influenza virus by decreasing IFITM3 levels (Figs 5, 6 and 7). Although this work is the first of its kind to identify NEDD4 as a negative regulator of IFITM3 levels, NEDD4 is well described to be necessary for the replication of several important RNA viruses. For example, NEDD4 interacts with proline-rich motifs in the viral late budding domains of Ebola virus [49], rabies virus [50], and HIV [51]. Mono-ubiquitination of these domains promotes efficient budding and viral egress necessary for productive viral spread. However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of NEDD4 will serve as an effective in vivo antiviral strategy, particularly since NEDD4 is a developmentally essential molecule as demonstrated by the embryonic lethality of NEDD4 KO mice [52]. Likewise, NEDD4 has been implicated in regulation of insulin-like growth factor signaling [53], T-cell-mediated immunity [54,55], and tumor suppression [56]. On the other hand, neuron- and skeletal muscle-specific NEDD4 KO mice are viable [57,58], and NEDD4 is naturally inhibited by ISG15 during virus infections [29,30], perhaps suggesting that short-term inhibition of NEDD4 can occur without adverse effects. Additional experimentation will be needed to answer these vital questions, and this will be aided by the development of selective NEDD4 inhibitors, which is an area of active investigation [59,60]. Overall, our study identifies inhibition of NEDD4 as a novel strategy for preventing infection by influenza virus and other IFITM3-sensitive viruses through the increased accumulation of the antiviral restriction factor IFITM3.",

PR8 and X-31 were provided to us by Drs. Bruno Moltedo and Thomas Moran (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and the 2011 virus isolates were obtained from BEI Resources sponsored by the NIH/NIAID. SeV expressing green fluorescent protein (SeV-GFP)[65] was generated by Dr. Dominique Garcin (University de Geneve) and provided to us by Dr. Mark Peeples (Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital Research Institute). SeV-GFP was propagated in 10-day embryonated chicken eggs for 40 h at 37\u00b0C as described previously [66]. VSV G-pseudotyped retrovirus expressing green fluorescent protein was generated by transfection of the viral vector pLenti-CMV-GFP-puro (Addgene plasmid 17448, deposited by Dr. Eric Campeau)[67] and packaging plasmids (provided by Dr. Li Wu, The Ohio State University) along with plasmid expressing VSV G into HEK293T cells. Direct inhibition of GFP production by IFITM3 was not expected since this is driven by the CMV immediate early promoter and bypasses retrovirus-specific expression machinery [68]. Media was changed 18 h post-transfection, and media containing virus was then harvested 48 h post-transfection. Virus-containing media was centrifuged at 1200 x g for 5 min, filtered with 0.45 \u03bcm filters, frozen, stored at -80\u00b0C, and used for infection at a dose that provided approximately 70% infection of WT MEFs. MEFs were infected with IAV PR8, X-31, and H3N2 2011 strains, SeV and IBV at a multiplicity of infection of 5.0 or 10.0. MEFs were infected for 24 h, except in the case of VSV G-pseudotyped retrovirus infections, which were analyzed after 48 h of infection. A549 cells were infected with IAV strain PR8 at a multiplicity of infection of 2.5 for 6 h. Infected cells were washed with PBS and harvested in 0.25% trypsin EDTA. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. IAV infected cells were stained with anti-influenza nucleoprotein (Abcam, catalog no. ab20343, 1:333) directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 using a 100 \u03bcg antibody labeling kit (Life Technologies). IBV infected cells were stained with anti-IBV nucleoprotein (Thermo Scientific catalogue no. MA1-80712, 1:1000) followed by anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated directly to Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies). Measurement of SeV and VSV G-pseudotyped retrovirus infection rates was done by detecting virus-encoded GFP. All antibodies were diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and cells were stained for 20 min. Cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS after each antibody treatment. PBS was used for final resuspension of cells for flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Results were analyzed using FlowJo software.",

A) Cells were collected just prior to infection for confirmation of NEDD4 knockdown by anti-NEDD4 Western blotting, with anti-actin blotting serving as a loading control. Anti-IFITM3 blotting demonstrates an increase in IFITM3 upon NEDD4 knockdown. B,C) Following siRNA treatment, cells were infected with influenza virus strain PR8 at an MOI of 2.5 for 6 h. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-influenza virus NP to measure the percentage of cells infected using flow cytometry. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments, with samples run in triplicate.

D) NCI-H358 and NCI-H2009 cells were transfected for 48 h with siControl or siNEDD4. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-NEDD4 to confirm NEDD4 knockdown, anti-IFITM3 to demonstrate increase in endogenous IFITM3 upon NEDD4 knockdown, and anti-GAPDH as a loading control. E) A549 cells were treated with equal volumes Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control, MG132 (10 \u03bcM), Chloroquine (10 \u03bcM), Bafilomycin A1 (1 \u03bcM), or Leupeptin (100 \u03bcM) for 24 h. Cells were also treated with IFN-\u03b1 (100 units/mL) for comparison. Cell lysates were subjected to anti-IFITM3 immunoblotting to evaluate endogenous IFITM3 levels with each treatment.
