            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently identified member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that degrades angiotensin (Ang) II to the seven amino acid peptide fragment Ang-(1-7) [1], [2]. ACE2 is a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), but is not blocked by ACE inhibitors. Although ACE2 is found in many tissues, expression is especially high in the kidney, particularly within cells of the proximal tubule [3]\u2013[5]. In mice deletion of the ACE2 gene is associated with development of late-stage glomerulosclerosis, and acceleration of diabetic nephropathy, in the absence of hypertension [6], [7]. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, administration of human recombinant ACE2 reduces blood pressure [8], and in diabetic mice, exogenous human ACE2 diminishes blood pressure and glomerular injury [9]. Thus, ACE2 may be an endogenous protector against the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).",

            "text": "In kidney tubular epithelial cells, ACE2 is localized to the apical membrane and also appears in the cytoplasm [3], [10]. ACE2 is shed at its carboxy-terminus from the plasma membrane in cultured human embryonic kidney cells and airway epithelial cells, a process catalyzed by the enzyme \u201ca disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17\u201d (ADAM-17) [11]\u2013[13]. Whether this process occurs in the proximal tubule is unclear, although soluble ACE2 has been detected in human urine [10]. In a recent study, urinary levels of ACE2 protein were significantly increased in humans with CKD (the majority with chronic glomerulonephritis), compared to healthy controls, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [14]. Urinary ACE2 was also higher in diabetics with CKD [14]. These results suggest that ACE2 may be shed into the urine, and could be a biomarker in CKD patients. However, the presence of urinary ACE2 has not been studied in renal transplant recipients, and the factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 remain unclear. Accordingly, the principle objective of the present study was to determine if urinary ACE2 activity, protein, and mRNA can be detected in renal transplant patients, and to identify factors associated with the presence of ACE2. In addition, we examined factors associated with urinary ACE activity, protein and mRNA in these patients. Our data indicate that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes, possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells.",

At the time of enrollment, half of the transplant subjects (n = 50) were also enrolled in an ongoing randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of the ACE inhibitor ramipril on transplant outcomes (ACE inhibition for the preservation of renal function and survival in kidney transplantation; International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry ISRCTN-78129473), but had not yet received either placebo or ramipril. These subjects had documented significant proteinuria (>200 mg urinary protein/day) at baseline. The 50 other transplant recipients were patients without significant proteinuria (spot urine ACR in the normal range, or <200 mg proteinuria/day).

            "text": "Although gender did not influence urinary ACE2 activity or protein, in the present studies females had significantly higher urinary ACE2 mRNA levels. The gene for ACE2 is located on the X chromosome [2], and in the rat renal wrap model of hypertension, intrarenal ACE2 activity and expression are up-regulated by estrogens [23], raising the possibility that female transplant recipients may express ACE2 mRNA at higher levels in the kidney compared to males. Female gender was also associated with higher urinary ACE mRNA levels, as was albuminuria, the latter being in agreement with studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy [24]. The cellular origin of urinary mRNA for ACE2 or ACE is unknown, although it has been speculated that proximal tubular cells may be the source, since they express all components of the RAS, and are found in the urine sediment [24]. However, the physiological significance of urinary ACE2 or ACE mRNA levels is unclear. In this regard, diabetes, albuminuria and eGFR did not influence urinary ACE2 mRNA levels in our transplant recipients, a result that differs from diabetic nephropathy patients, where proteinuria was found to correlate positively with urinary ACE2 mRNA, and eGFR to correlate negatively with ACE2 mRNA [24]. Factors related to transplant could therefore have an independent influence on urinary ACE2 mRNA. As one possibility, the use of immunosuppressive drugs in transplant subjects might regulate shedding of cells expressing ACE2 mRNA into the urine.",

Although Mizuiri et al. found higher urinary ACE2 levels in CKD patients, there was no difference in plasma ACE2 protein between CKD patients and healthy subjects [14]. However, the CKD patients in their study had significant albuminuria, suggesting that ACE2 may have leaked into the urine across the glomerular barrier. In the present study, we found no association between albuminuria and either urinary ACE2 activity or protein levels by western analysis. The data suggest that urinary ACE2 protein likely derives via shedding from cells along the nephron, and not from filtration from plasma. In support of this hypothesis, soluble ACE2 is shed from the plasma membrane in cell culture systems, via cleavage at its ectodomain by the protease enzyme ADAM-17 [11]\u2013[13]. Interestingly, renal ADAM-17 is up-regulated in Ang II-induced kidney injury [25], and de novo expression occurs in human kidney disease, in proximal tubule, podocytes, and mesangial cells [26]. Whether ADAM-17 is activated in the transplant kidney in the presence of diabetes, and mediates shedding of soluble ACE2 into the urine requires further study.",

One band was found at 120 kDA, consistent with the full-length protein, and the other at 90 kDa, which is likely a cleaved ACE2 fragment. Thus, the 90 kDa fragment does not simply represent a deglycosylated form of full-length ACE2, since incubation with PNGase F resulted in a further reduction in its size, as shown in Figure 2D. To determine if this 90 kDa fragment is generated by ADAM-17-mediated cleavage of ACE2, further characterization is required, including use of antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic carboxyterminus of ACE2 (which may be lacking in this fragment), and/or direct sequence analysis of the polypeptide. Furthermore, although shedding of ACE2 fragments may occur via ADAM-17 in transplant subjects, proteomic analysis has identified ACE2 as one of the 1132 proteins present in urinary exosomes isolated from human urine [27], suggesting that membrane-bound full-length ACE2 may also be a source of urinary ACE2.",

Finally, although diabetics had higher urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels, there was no significant association between diabetes and urinary levels of Ang-(1-7) by multivariate analysis, suggesting that urinary Ang-(1-7) may be influenced by other factors. A potential limitation of the urinary angiotensin peptide measurements is that urine specimens were not treated with protease inhibitors, which could have affected the sensitivity for detecting differences.
