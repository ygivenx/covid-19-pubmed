Treatment groups were fed with ethanol supplemented with curcumin (400 or 1 200 mg/kg bw). The liver histopathology in ethanol group revealed mild-to-moderate steatosis and mild necroinflammation. Hepatic MDA, hepatocyte apoptosis, and NF-kappaB activation increased significantly in ethanol-treated group when compared with control. Curcumin treatments resulted in improving of liver pathology, decreasing the elevation of hepatic MDA, and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. The 400 mg/kg bw of curcumin treatment also revealed a trend of decreased hepatocyte apoptosis.

The reduction of the gene transcriptions of TNF-alpha, NF-kappaB, and HMG-CoA was the mechanism proposed by wich curcumin exercise its beneficial effects in NASH. The results of this study indicate, moreover, that the water-soluble curcumin derivative displays superior bioavailability to the parent curcumin, which can effectively improve the lipid metabolism and delay the progression of hepatic fibrosis in rats with steatohepatitis [40].

Curcumin induces apoptosis and blocks proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and, via activation of PPAR\u03b3, inhibits extracellular matrix formation, downregulates the expression of LDL receptors, induces SREBP-1c,and increases the fat-storing capacity of HSC, and it may thereby restore this \u201cprotective\u201d functionality, proving of therapeutic usage in preventing liver steatosis and fibrosis [43].

In hepatology, experimental data in transgenic mice deficient in homocysteine metabolism enzymes have shown the presence of severe liver steatosis with occasional steatohepatitis. In chronic hepatitis C, preliminary data have shown that hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for steatosis or even fibrosis. The physiopathological mechanism has now begun to be better understood. On one hand, there is a strong correlation between homocysteine and insulin resistance whatever its etiology. On the other hand, homocysteine has a direct effect on the liver, resulting in overexpression of SREBP-1 and favoring steatosis. It stimulates proinflammatory cytokine secretion such as NF kappa B increasing the risk of NASH. Finally, homocysteine could increase the risk of fibrosis by stimulating TIMP 1. Moreover, hepatitis C virus induces hypomethylation of STAT 1 and could decrease the antiviral activity of interferon. Results from in vitro studies have shown that the normalization of STAT 1 methylation by bringing betaine and S Adenosyl Methionine (which belongs to homocysteine cycle) restores the antiviral activity of interferon. Finally, treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia could have favorable consequences in steatohepatites and HCV infection [75, 76]. ",

The mechanism of action appears to be related to the suppressive effect of Phyllanthus extract on HBsAg secretion and HBsAg mRNA expression [138] and the inhibition of hepatitis B virus polymerase activity [139]. A recent study isolated a polyphenolic compound, 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucose (1246TGG), from P. emblica, and found that treatment with 1246TGG (6.25 \u03bcg/mL, 3.13 \u03bcg/mL), reduced both HBsAg and HBeAg levels in culture supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells [140]. The role of Phyllanthus spp. in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B was studied in several reports that were evaluated in a recent Cochrane review. The authors included a total of 16 randomized trials but only one compared Phyllanthus with placebo and found no significant difference in HBeAg seroconversion after the end of treatment or followup. Fifteen trials compared Phyllanthus plus an antiviral drug like interferon alpha, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, thymosin, vidarabine, or conventional treatment with the same antiviral drug alone and found that the combined treatment affect serum HBV DNA, serum HBeAg, and HBeAg seroconversion. The authors conclude that Phyllanthus in combination with an antiviral drug may be better than the same antiviral drug alone but clinical trials with large sample size and low risk of bias are needed to confirm these findings [141].
