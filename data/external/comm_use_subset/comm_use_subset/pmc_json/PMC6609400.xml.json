Indigo use dates back to at least 6000 years, it is referred to as \u2018blue gold\u2019 because of its great value of trading commodity [2, 3]. In addition to as natural dyes, indigo is also used as a food colorant and for medicinal use [2]. Historically, indigo is extracted from indigo-yielding plant species. The indigo-yielding plant species were important cash crops on farmers in India, China, Central America, South Carolina, the southern USA, and Indonesia [4, 5]. Indigo-dyed textiles were widely traded along the legendary Silk Road linking China to Europe [6]. However, in the twentieth century, most commercial natural indigo production declined after the advent of chemically synthetic indigo [2].",

However, the production of large-scale synthetic indigo presents a serious environmental issues. The synthetic indigo is produced by aniline. Aniline is derived from the petroleum product benzene. It is toxic and the synthesis involves hazardous chemicals [4]. On the contrary, traditional indigo dyes are of plant origin, which exhibits better bio-degradability and more sustainable than synthetic counterparts [8]. Recent years have seen a burgeoning interest in the natural dyes in textile research, eco-friendly fashion, and sustainable-production [4, 6]. Consequently, it is important to find potential indigo-yielding plant species for \u201cgreener,\u201d eco-friendly indigo extraction at a larger scale.",

For example, Cardon [9] recorded about 20 indigo-yielding plant species (7 families and 9 genera) used globally. Han\u2019s study [10] showed that four indigo-yielding plant species (four families and four genera) were mainly used for indigo extraction in Ming (1368\u20131644 C.E.) and Qing Dynasties (1644\u20131911 C.E.) in China. However, for some indigo-yielding plant species, apart from a brief mention of use of indigo extraction, there are few contemporary accounts of the indigo extraction methods or how local dyers harvest in China. This knowledge gap needs to be filled before traditional indigo-yielding plant use and extraction methods disappear.",

There are eight plant species that mentioned as blue dyestuff on Hainan Island [13]. Nevertheless, only one species (Indigofera tinctoria Linn.) was documented for indigo extraction [14]. Secondly, few studies [15, 16] in recent years indicated that the Hainan Miao and Li nationalities were still wearing indigo-dyed clothes during the traditional festivals and wedding.",

Yet, the Li (\u9ece) of Hainan Island, also known as Hlai (a Tai-Kadai language group), migrated from Guangdong and Guangxilong Province before the Qin Dynasty (221\u2013206 B.C.) [17, 19]. Although the traditional costumes of the two minorities are indigo-dyed textile, Hainan Miao are expert of batik (wax resist) techniques while the Li textile weavers are famous of wrap ikat techniques [20, 21]. Prior research has focused on the indigo dyeing techniques and the meaning of the patterns [22, 23], but little attention has been paid to the scientific names of indigo-yielding species and detailed indigo extraction methods.

Both of these Indigofera species were called gam za/ging by the Hainan Miao and be fa by the Li dyers. This under-differentiation occurs despite both Hainan Miao and Li dyers being able to distinguish these two plant species on the basis of the different fruit shapes, leaf sizes, and heights of these Indigofera species. Local dyers observed that Indigofera tinctoria has straight fruits, smaller leaves and is around a meter high, while Indigofera suffruticosa has curved fruits, its leaves are bigger, and the plant can grow into a tall bush over 2 m high. However, Strobilanthes cusia was given two vernacular names by Hainan Miao dyers according to the leaf sizes. Those with large leaves that grow under the shadow of trees were called gam luo, while the small ones were called gam dun. Luo means large and dun means small in local Hainan Miao language.",

For the indigo-yielding plant species used in the present, in the Hainan Miao study villages, Strobilanthes cusia is the main source of indigo, while Indigofera suffruticosa, Indigofera tinctoria, and Wrightia laevis were used as supplements for indigo extraction.

Further, it is interesting that Strobilanthes cusia was given the lowest score (3.10) by Li dyers, which was very different from the preference of Hainan Miao dyers. This can be explained by the different environmental conditions of the study sites. The Li study villages are at a lower altitude and are drier, so are less suitable for the growth of Strobilanthes cusia. Only about 20% (n = 10) Li dyers knew how to use Strobilanthes cusia, and this is known through gift exchange.

The indigo extraction method was shown in Figs. 2 and 3: (1) harvesting: the fresh materials of indigo-yielding plant species are harvested and transported from the field to their homes; (2) fermentation: the materials were bent and left to steep in a cistern and added cool water to completely immerse the materials. Then removed the materials from the fermentation vat when they rotted. This process usually took 2 to 3 days depending on the amount of soaking materials and the weather condition, up to 1 week; (3) oxygenation: lime powder water was added to the fermentation vat, and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 0.5 to 1.5 h. When the foam was less and the foam color was blue and reddish, the dyers stop the oxygenation process. (4) Sedimentation: after resting for one or two nights, the blue sediment was on the bottom of the cistern and was called lan dian (\u84dd\u975b) (translation: indigo paste). The lan dian, compacted in paste, will transfer to a small plastics bucket or pot to keep it moist for storage.

(Euphorbiaceae), known as gen zong in Hainan Miao language, has two varieties that are distinguished by the color of their stems and leaves (voucher numbers ZLB45, ZLB60). A small number of Ricinus communis seeds were added to the extraction vat at the end of the oxygenation process to help reduce the foam. This is because the Hainan Miao dyers believed that the foam reduced the quality of indigo paste. Commonly 2\u20135 still moist seeds were crushed on the side of the extraction vat. Some dyers stripped off the seed coat before crushing them. The Ricinus communis seeds were then held while stirring in the extraction vat for 1\u20132 min before throwing away the seeds at the end of this process.

In this study, the detailed indigo extraction method of Wrightia laevis was first documented (Table 4). Although Wrightia laevis was the least favored (PR = 2.95) for its low indigo paste quality, it was still as a supplement because this species is easy to find around the villages (A1 = 1.48, A2 = 1.01). For Hainan Miao dyers, the most cited and favored species is Strobilanthes cusia. The respondents gave the reason that Strobilanthes cusia provide the highest yield of indigo paste according to their experience, which is consistent with Chanayath\u2019s result that Strobilanthes cusia gave more indigo than Indigofera tinctoria (the main indigo source in the world) in the ratio of 4:3 [37]. Further, it is easy to survive by cuttings and become the main source of indigo paste in Hainan Miao villages. In China, apart from the indigo paste source, Strobilanthes cusia is also a frequently used Chinese herbal medicine (TMC) that recorded in \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Pharmacopoeia 2015\u201d [38]. For example, its roots are known as \u201cNan-Ban-Lan-Gen (\u5357\u677f\u84dd\u6839),\u201d commonly used to prevent and treat virus-related respiratory diseases such as influenza virus infection [39]. Its leaves and stems are produced as \u201cindigo naturalis (\u9752\u9edb)\u201d to treat chronic diseases such as psoriasis [40]. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Strobilanthes cusia has been listed as one of the eight major anti-SARS medicines [41, 42]. Moreover, prior ethnobotanical surveys have shown that the tender stems and leaves of this species are also as an edible vegetable in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China [43]. So it is not difficult to find that Strobilanthes cusia has potential commercial value for sustainable indigo production and medicinal use.",

This is because the growth period of Indigofera suffruticosa is longer than Indigofera tinctoria. So the acreage of Indigofera suffruticosa is smaller in Li villages in spite of its high indigo quality. Indigofera tinctoria, commonly known as \u201ctrue indigo,\u201d is the most widely exploited of all indigo-yielding plant species [44]. This tropical species is thought to \u201chave spread with dyeing technology (and the word nila itself, as already noted) from India first to South East Asia, then through the Middle East to parts of Africa, and later to America\u201d [45]. Consequently, Indigofera tinctoria is another potential candidate for sustainable indigo production.",

However, the steeping method practiced by Hainan Miao and Li dyers differs from those used by other minorities. For example, the parts used of Indigofera tinctoria and Indigofera suffruticosa were different. A previous study [1] showed that the indigo compounds from the two species are extracted by steeping leaves, but we found the stems, leaves, and ripe fruit were used in Li villages. This is because Li dyers believed the high-quality indigo paste needed the fruit ripening period according to the experience. So, they usually sow in March to April and harvest from July to September.",

The Ricinus communis seeds were used at the end of the oxygenation process by Hainan Miao dyers but Li dyers did not use them. This is because Hainan Miao believed that Ricinus communis seed use could reduce foam to improve indigo paste quality. This introduced plant species are commonly found in all five Hainan Miao villages, which might be one reason for its use. However, the mechanism of Ricinus communis seed use to improve indigo paste quality is still unknown. Legrand [49] described another plant species used in the steeping method in Santiago Niltepec of Mexico, the pulpy fruit of a local plant known as \u201cgulavere\u201d is added to the oxygenation vat to help accelerate sedimentation. Nevertheless, there is no information on which species the local name gulavere represents or on its possible chemical function in assisting indigo sedimentation.",

Stored in the vacuole of indigo-yielding plant species, indican was hydrolyzed and produce indoxyl after steeping in the water, and thereby indoxyl molecules produce a chemical reaction to form indigo pigment [51]. In most common situations, indigo is blue color and indirubin is red [52]. If there were fewer impurities in the indigo paste, the blue and red color would be more obvious. Namely, to a certain extent, the color implies the purity of chemical pigments of indigo paste. This may explain the folk knowledge that Hainan Miao and Li respondents believed those with dark blue and reddish indigo paste were of good quality.",

Firstly, in addition to water, the actual indigo content in the indigo paste could vary from 2 to 70%, the rest were lime, indirubin, and other organic materials [47]. Yet, synthetic indigo owns consistently high purity, which has always exceeded 90% [1]. To improve the indigo purity of traditional indigo-extracting methods, more attention should be paid to the indican metabolism since the indigo pigments come from the precursor indican as discussed above. Secondly, the method of synthetic indigo production is controllable because it follows specific chemical reactions [6]. However, the indigo yield of the traditional method is so hard to control that even a senior dyer cannot guarantee the same indigo yield every time. The water-to-biomass ratio, fermentation duration, fermentation temperature, lime quality, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentration are directly or indirectly related to indigo yield [11]. Therefore, a better understanding of these physicochemical parameters may contribute to adopt novel technologies to help standardize the traditional indigo extraction methods.",
