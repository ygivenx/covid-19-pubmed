            "text": "The genus Pestivirus is contained within the family Flaviviridae, which includes positive, single-stranded RNA viruses with \u223c12 kb genomes and a single open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- untranslated regions (UTRs). The polyprotein is translated from genomic RNA and translation is initiated by a cap-independent mechanism through a type IV internal ribosomal entry site within the 5\u2032-UTR. The single polyprotein is then cleaved into four structural and eight non-structural proteins by cellular and viral proteases. Pestiviruses were previously divided into four species, including bovine viral diarrhea viruses 1 and 2 (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), and border disease virus (BDV) of sheep or goats (Becher et al., 2003; Simmonds et al., 2017). More recently, the original four species were re-classified as Pestivirus A, Pestivirus B, Pestivirus C, and Pestivirus D. Since several new pestiviruses have been characterized in other hosts, seven new species of Pestivirus were identified: Pestivirus E (pronghorn antelope pestivirus), Pestivirus F (porcine Bungowannah virus), Pestivirus G (giraffe pestivirus), Pestivirus H (Hobi-like bovine pestivirus), Pestivirus I (sheep Aydin-like pestivirus), Pestivirus J (rat pestivirus), and Pestivirus K (atypical porcine pestivirus, APPV) (Avalos-Ramirez et al., 2001; Kirkland et al., 2007; Becher et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Firth et al., 2014; Hause et al., 2015; de Groof et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Pestiviruses can infect a variety of artiodactylous hosts, including swine and ruminants (Tautz et al., 2015). Diseases associated with pestiviruses include hemorrhagic symptoms, abortion, respiratory disease, and fatal mucosal disease. BVDV and CSFV are severely pathogenic in cattle and swine, respectively, and are endemic in many countries (Liu et al., 2012; Chander et al., 2014). Recently, the divergent pestiviruses, Bungowannah virus and APPV, began to be considered a threat to pig health (Kirkland et al., 2007; Hause et al., 2015). In previous work from our lab, we found partial RaPestV-1 genome sequence in Rhinolophus bats from Hainan province in China. As such, we were the first to describe the identification of pestivirus in species outside the order Artiodactyla (Wu et al., 2012). An RaPestV-1 related pestivirus, APPV, was recently discovered in North America and Europe, and was highly suspected to be the causative agent of a type A-II congenital tremor (CT A-II) in piglets (Hause et al., 2015; de Groof et al., 2016; Postel et al., 2016; Beer et al., 2017; Lamp et al., 2017). Recently, the identification of a divergent pestivirus (Norway rat pestivirus, NRPV) in New York City suggested that Norwegian rats (Rattus norvegicus) can also serve as natural hosts for pestivirus (Firth et al., 2014). These findings suggested a wider pestivirus host range than previously known and highlighted the need for an improved understanding of the biodiversity and evolution of pestivirus in bats and rodents.",

In the present study, we use virome analysis by using sequence-independent PCR amplification, next-generation sequencing, and sequence similarity comparisons to classify identified pestiviruses. Novel sequencing reads related to pestivirus were found in samples collected from different bat and rodent species. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses of these viruses revealed the presences of six novel pestivirus species in bat and rodent hosts.",

The prevalence of specific pestiviruses were then re-evaluated by single-strain screening with specific reads-based nested-PCR, as shown in Table 1. By this method, five bat anal swab samples, twelve rodent anal swab samples, and two rodent pharyngeal swab samples were confirmed to be pestivirus-positive. Two rodent individuals were pestivirus-positive in both pharyngeal and anal swab samples.",

For BPV species 1, we used strain BtSk-PV-1/GX2017 as a reference, for which the 5\u2032- UTR was 391 nt and the 3\u2032- UTR was 538 nt. Each of these are consistent with the lengths of other pestivirus 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- UTR\u2019s. Each peptide of BPV species 1 and 2 aligned best with those of APPV, even when the overall identities between BPV species 1 and APPV were relatively low when compared with the identities between BPV species 2 and APPV. Each mature peptide had very low aa sequence identity when compared with those of other pestiviruses. The non-structural autoprotease (Npro) protein of BPV species 1 was predicted to be self-cleaved from the polyprotein between Cys176 and Ser177, and the conserved catalytic residues were identified as Glu42, His67, and Cys87. A slightly larger core protein (C) was located between Npro and the three envelope (E) glycoproteins (Erns, E1, and E2). An RNase T2 superfamily domain with uridylate specificity was identified in Erns between aa 320 and 374 of the polyprotein. A peptidase S31 domain between aa 1330 and 1508, and a helicase associated domain between aa 1557 and 1875 were identified in the NS3 protease. Due to the lack of significant similarity to other pestiviruses, some domains that were conserved in previously reported artiodactylous pestiviruses were not found in the polypeptides of BPV species 1 and 2.",

The aa identity of mature peptides between RPVs and other pestiviruses were then calculated from pairwise alignments (Figure 3). Despite the extensive sequence diversity, each peptide of RPV species 1 matched best with that of NRPV, the identities between RPV species 1 and NRPV were higher than between RPV species 2\u20134 and NRPV. The P7 peptides were the most divergent regions of RPVs, as they showed only 31\u201363% aa identity with P7 of NRPV, respectively, and lacked significant similarity to any other proteins in GenBank. The Npro proteins were 293\u2013304 aa, which is longer than those found in other pestiviruses. The conserved Npro catalytic residues were identified in both RPVs (RtNc-PV/HuB2014: Glu149, His190, and Cys208; RtAp-PV/JL2014: Glu133, His179, and Cys197; RtNe-PV/SC2014: Glu138, His180, and Cys198), but the self-cleavage site for Npro of RPV species 2\u20134 is between Cys and Asn (RtAp-PV/JL2014 and RtNe-PV/SC2014) or between Cys and Glu (RtAd-PV/SAX2015), which differs from those of RPV species 1 and other pestiviruses. The RNase T2 superfamily domains in Erns and peptidase S31 domains and helicase associated domains in the NS3 protease were also identified in RPVs.",

Consistent with the phylogeny of their hosts in order level, all pestiviruses were divided into three main lineages; the artiodactylous lineage, bat-swine lineage, and rodent lineage (Figure 4). Most pestiviruses that are associated with animals of the families Suidae, Bovidae, Cervidae, Antilocapridae, and Giraffidae under the order Artiodactyla clustered together under the artiodactylous lineage. However, viruses under the artiodactylous lineage tend to be inconsistent with host phylogenies, and multiple incongruous relationships between the phylogenies of hosts and viruses were identified. For example, diverse bovine and swine pestiviruses were scattered in the genus Pestivirus with much higher genetic diversity than pestiviruses of other host species.",

            "text": "Bats and rodents are the most abundant and diverse mammals in the world. They often live in close contact with human populations and their domestic animals, and act as a bridge between humans, domestic animals, and other wildlife, thus exposing humans to some zoonoses in these natural ecosystems (Meerburg et al., 2009; Smith and Wang, 2013; Chen et al., 2014, 2017; Han et al., 2015; Olival et al., 2017). Many viral causative agents of human and domestic animal diseases, including severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus, henipaviruses, hantaviruses, and arenaviruses, are widely recognized as having originated or been transmitted from wild bat or rodent hosts (Wang et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015b; Blasdell et al., 2016). Recently, a novel causative agent of fatal disease in pigs known as swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus, was confirmed as being an HKU2-related alphacoronavirus that originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) (Zhou et al., 2018). Furthermore, an atypical porcine pestivirus, APPV, which caused piglet CT A-II in Europe and North America showed close resemblance to a horseshoe bat pestivirus, RaPestV-1 (Hause et al., 2015; de Groof et al., 2016; Postel et al., 2016; Beer et al., 2017). The identification of diverse rodent arteriviruses in our recent report also revealed a much closer common ancestor of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in the rodents pestiviruses (Wu et al., 2018b). These new findings further emphasize the importance of bats and rodents as natural reservoirs of viruses that threaten the health of pigs and by extension, cause tremendous economic losses to the swine industry. Though a large volume of wildlife virome data has been obtained in the past decade, a predictive analysis revealed that the viral richness in wildlife is somewhat limited, and there is still a large number of \u201cmissing potentially zoonotic viruses.\u201d This missing data merits further systematic global surveillance, especially in bats, rodents, and primates (Olival et al., 2017).",

Considering their divergent phylogenetic positions, different genome sizes and structures, and the minimal sequence similarities of BPVs and RPVs when compared to other pestiviruses, we propose classifying members of the genus Pestivirus into three main lineages; bat-swine, rodent, and artiodactylous lineages, based on the order level of their hosts. BPV species 1 and 2, and APPV represent the preliminary species under the bat-swine lineage, and RPV species 1\u20134 represent the preliminary species under the rodent lineage. Furthermore, the close relationship between APPV and BPVs indicates the presence of a much closer common ancestor of APPV in bats than in other swine pestiviruses. These viruses may have evolved independently in pigs and bats, eventually forming at least three sub-lineages under bat-swine lineage. Given that pestiviruses can cross species barriers to infect a wide range of artiodactylous animals (Becher et al., 1997), further work should be conducted to investigate the prevalence of BPVs and RPVs worldwide and to evaluate their virulence in animal experiments.",
