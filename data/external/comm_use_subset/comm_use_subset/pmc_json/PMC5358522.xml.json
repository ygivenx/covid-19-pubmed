These NTDs were selected on the basis that their transmission characteristics or treatment opportunities make them good candidates for control and elimination [3].",

POC assays for HIV early infant diagnosis and viral load are currently under evaluation and will be implemented shortly. The expectations are that these tests will increase access to HIV viral load monitoring and early infant diagnosis with faster turn-around time for results to patients, increased linkage to care and reduced loss-to-follow up, and decreased risk of drug resistance.",

After multiple rounds of MDA, highly sensitive and specific diagnostics are needed to locate \u201chot spots\u201d of residual infection. For schistosomiasis, the intensity of transmission decreases with decreasing prevalence of infection. Microscopy is no longer sufficiently sensitive to detect residual infection in communities when the number of eggs per gram of stool falls below 40. Antigen or nucleic acid amplified tests (NAATs) are needed to replace microscopy to identify communities in which transmission is still occurring. However, most antigen detection tests using enzyme immunoassays or lateral flow tests have not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive and current NAATs are too expensive and technical demanding for community based screening. As NAATs become available in POC format and have data transmission capabilities, these devices can be taken around to different communities to determine the stage of control and to inform treatment strategies.",

To implement a successful POC diagnostics programme, the engagement of policy makers, stakeholders and partners to ensure buy-in and align necessary resources is a critical first step. Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29], [30], [31]. Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes. Another key barrier to the appropriate use of POC diagnostics is the need to train clinicians to create a demand for them and then use the test results to effectively manage the patients. Improving the laboratory-clinician interface is an important but often neglected aspect of testing introduction.",
