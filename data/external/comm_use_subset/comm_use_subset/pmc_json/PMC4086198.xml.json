These viruses need to be quickly identified and characterized, since they might represent a significant public health concern (Peiris et al., 2004). In both cases the application of broad-spectrum virus discovery techniques can be useful to detect previously unrecognized or emerging pathogens, and the introduction in the market of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methodologies considerably improved the efficacy of such methods (Mokili et al., 2012).",

Papillomaviruses carry a circular double stranded DNA genome, are non-enveloped and are known for their capacity to induce warts and benign lesions of mucous membranes (condylomas; Howley and Lowy, 2007). Some human papillomaviruses (HPVs) can cause cancers, of which cervical cancer is the most notorious (Bosch et al., 1995). HPVs are not known as causative agents of respiratory infections, although some studies report the presence of different HPVs types in the respiratory tract of infants with respiratory diseases but also in healthy adults (Kurose et al., 2004; Martinelli et al., 2012; Forslund et al., 2013; Mokili et al., 2013). HPVs are also involved in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), a disease characterized by growth of tumors around the vocal cords and in the larynx (Mammas et al., 2014). The pathogenic role of HPVs seems to be genus/type specific: cervical cancer and RRP are induced by \u03b1-HPVs (particularly types 16, 18, in cervical cancer, type 11 and 6 in RRP), while \u03b3-HPVs are known to be causative agents of warts or skin lesions. Furthermore, several HPVs, especially from the \u03b4- and \u03b3-genus, can be detected on healthy normal skin (Astori et al., 1998; Antonsson et al., 2000; Li et al., 2012).",
