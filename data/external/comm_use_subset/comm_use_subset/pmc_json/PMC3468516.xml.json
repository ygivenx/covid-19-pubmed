            "text": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an indication of acute lung injury (ALI), is highly associated with sepsis [1], [2] pneumonias [3], and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3], [4]. Pathogenesis of ARDS involves release of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and nitric oxide (NO) [5]\u2013[7] among others. High level of TNF-\u03b1 production, an early warning signal, can aggravate lung injuries [8]. Activated alveolar macrophages and neutrophils also cause excessive productions of NO via the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [9]. The high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a late acting cytokine, also contributes to significant lung damages [10], [11], although HMGB1 may be expressed earlier in different disease models [12]. Patients with ARDS and the endotoxemic animals have an early increase of TNF-\u03b1 and NO, and the late elevation of HMGB1 in the lung epithelium fluid and plasma [13]. Accordingly, these proinflammatory mediators and their upstream NF-\u03baB signaling pathway may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of ALI. Blockade of TNF, NO, HMGB1 release may lessen the severity of LPS-induced ALI [11], [14].",

An initial significant decrease in circulating WBC which peaked between the 2nd to 4th hr after LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) challenge was found (Fig. 1A). The WBC counts slowly returned to the basal level at 8th hr after LPS challenge. OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr after LPS challenge prevented the decrease or facilitated the recovery of circulating WBC at the 4th hr after LPS administration. In contrast, plasma TNF-\u03b1 was significantly elevated and peaked at the 1st hr, and was followed by rapid decline to the basal level at the 8th hr after LPS treatment (Fig. 1B). Administration of OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr post LPS treatment significantly reduced the elevation of TNF-\u03b1 in 1 hr (2 hrs after LPS challenge) with earlier decline to the basal level at the 4th hr after LPS treatment, and was maintained at this basal level 24 hrs after LPS challenge (Fig. 1B). OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) given at 6 hrs after LPS challenge, however, did not significantly altered LPS effects on circulating WBC or plasma TNF-\u03b1 (data not shown).

The present findings of a large number of macrophages and PMNs in the lung tissues, increased endothelial permeability and tissue damage, and thickened intra-alveolar septa with excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and edema in the lungs are consistent with those reported by others [23]. Furthermore, the urethane-anesthetized rat model of ALI used in the present study has its advantage that hemodynamic changes can be monitored continuously for 24 hrs. The possibility, however, remains that beneficial effects of OroA may be attributed to urethane [24], [25] like other anesthetics such as ketamine and propofol which also have been reported to exhibit protection against LPS-induced endotoxemia [26], [27]. Although urethane at higher concentration (>1.1 g/kg, ip) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and protected rats against lethal endotoxemia with reduced TNF-\u03b1 release, urethane at lower concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 g/kg, ip) [25] did not show significant protection or prevent death from LPS challenge. The present results also indicated that urethane (0.5 g/kg, ip) alone did not suppress LPS-induced productions of iNOS, NO and the late acting cytokine HMGB1, or severe lung inflammation. Similar results were found in a conscious rat model (un-anesthetized rats) (our unpublished results). These results suggest that LPS-induced pathological changes are not significantly affected by urethane in the concentration used in the present study. For these reasons, the protective effect of OroA in urethane-anesthetized rats is not likely due to urethane at 0.5 g/kg (ip). For the same reasons, urethane at 0.5 g/kg (ip) does not seem to work in an additive or synergistic fashion with OroA, thereby exaggerating the natural ability of the compound. These results strongly support that the protective effect of OroA in urethane (0.5 g/kg, ip)-anesthetized rats is due primarily to OroA.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that OroA post-treatment (iv) not only suppressed sequestration of PMNs, but also attenuated formation of pulmonary edema. OroA appeared to relieve edema by protecting endothelial function to alleviate neutrophil sequestration. In addition, LPS-induced overproduction of TNF-\u03b1 and NO can cause vascular endothelial cell injury and increased vascular permeability in the lungs [33].

Furthermore, 6 to 24 hrs after LPS (Fig. 3), the increased NO and iNOS production was still markedly suppressed by OroA, while the circulating WBC returned to normal level. OroA appears to possess multi-sites of action in the early and the later phases of endotoxemia. Thus, OroA exhibited beneficial effect in managing endotoxemia early after application, but the effect was not transient. Strategically, it is logical to administer OroA as early as possible to block the early events of inflammation after LPS challenge.

OroA amelioration of LPS-induced ALI involved inhibition of activated NF-\u03baB and blockade of release of early and late-acting cytokines. OroA also inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) [20] which is known to play a role in lung inflammation [13]. Furthermore, our preliminary studies demonstrated that post treatment of OroA significantly reversed systemic hypotension with improved cardiac inotropy in LPS-treated rats. OroA, therefore, is a potentially useful compound that provides new strategy in clinical prevention and treatment of ARDS in sepsis.",
