Most people who contract influenza will recover in several days to less than two weeks, but some people will develop complications. Annual epidemics result in a high number of hospitalizations, with an estimated 3\u20135 million severe cases and 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally. Young children, adults aged 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic diseases are among those who are at high risk of serious flu complications, which possibly require hospitalization and sometimes result in death1,2. Influenza A infection accounts for the majority of hospitalizations, and it is the only type that causes global pandemic outbreaks (https://www.who.int/).",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the viral surface: the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N11)3. The HA molecule initiates infection by binding to receptors on specific host cells. The NA possesses receptor destroying activity, cleaving terminal sialic acid residues from cell-surface glycoproteins and gangliosides to release progeny virus from the host cell. Both are important targets for influenza virus therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection. Influenza viruses are constantly changing in two different ways: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is a mechanism for viruses that accumulate mutations within the genes that occur continually over time as the virus replicates. These changes of HA protein allows the virus to escape the pre-existing immunity in the hosts1. Antigenic shift is a sudden change in the antigenicity of influenza A virus. Antigenic shift can be the result of a direct jump from an unknown animal strain to humans or a reassortment of two or more influenza viruses within the same cell. It results in a new virus with the HA or the HA-NA combination that has emerged from an animal population so different from the same subtype in humans that most people do not have immunity to the new virus. Such new viruses may cause pandemics4. Antigenic drift occurs in all types of influenza viruses. Antigenic shift, however, occurs only in flu A because it infects more than just human. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza infection. It has moderate efficacy, good safety, and acceptable tolerability. However, vaccines lack cross-protection and exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy in some high-risk populations, including older people, young children and immunocompromised patients. In addition to vaccines, the general treatment and prophylaxis of influenza is limited to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza)5,6. The confirmed cases of influenza infection can be treated with both zanamivir and oseltamivir, and if administered within 36 to 48 h of the onset of clinical symptoms, both drugs reduce the duration of illness by 1\u20131.5 days in patients of all ages. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) is a novel selective inhibitor against influenza cap-dependent endonuclease of influenza A and B viruses and has been approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours7. However, influenza A virus rapidly acquired resistance against drugs by mutating these viral components. During the 2008\u20132009 season, over 99% of the H1N1 isolates were resistant to oseltamivir in the United States, Japan, and South Africa8. In addition, two influenza A (H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T substitution in the polymerase acidic subunit (PA) show the reduced susceptibility to baloxavir9. Patients infected with baloxavir-resistant viruses exhibited prolonged virus shedding, and the median time to symptom alleviation was longer in baloxavir recipients infected with viruses bearing these substitutions than in those infected with viruses that lacked these substitutions7,10. Because of the emergence of drug resistance, short treatment windows for antiviral drugs, and the unsatisfactory efficacy of currently available vaccines, there is an unmet medical need for influenza therapy.",

            "text": "Most influenza virus-neutralizing antibodies, elicited via vaccination or infection, bind to the globular head of HA and block the interaction between the viral sialic acid receptors and the host cells. Recently, several studies have shown that influenza-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes of influenza virus might offer an alternative treatment. Passive immunotherapy using anti-influenza antibodies has the potential to prevent and treat influenza. Ideally, neutralizing antibodies exhibit a potent effect in direct viral neutralization and induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro or in vivo. In this study, we identified a human anti-H1N1 (influenza A virus A/California/7/2009 NYMCX-179A) neutralizing antibody via an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cell-based technology. It interacts specifically with the HA head portion of H1N1 after 2009. We further characterized the mode of binding by analyzing the complex crystal structure of the fragment for antigen-binding (Fab) and the antigen.",

As shown in Fig. 1b, the specific binding profile of 32D6 and H1N1 followed a hyperbolic curve, suggesting a strong interaction between the antibody and virus. In contrast, very weak binding was observed for either H5N1 or H7N9 as the binding partner of 32D6. The specificity was also examined via a neutralization assay. As shown in Fig. 1c, 32D6 showed strong neutralization ability against the H1N1 virus. The profile of 32D6 neutralization activity against H1N1 also turned out to be hyperbolic, from which a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.036 \u03bcg/mL was calculated (Fig. 1d). Further, 32D6 showed little activity against all other strains, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 (Fig. 1c). In summary, 32D6 is a specific anti-H1N1 monoclonal antibody.",

As shown in Fig. 2, six clinical isolates before the pandemic all failed to be recognized by 32D6, whereas five isolates after the pandemic could all be neutralized by 32D6. The corresponding EC50 are listed in Table 1. The EC50 of 32D6 (0.036 \u03bcg/mL) for strain A/Taiwan/80813/2013 is slightly higher than those for the four strains of A/California/7/2009, which range from 0.005 to 0.014 \u03bcg/mL.

The crystals belong to space group P3112 with four 32D6-Fab/HA1 complexes packed into an asymmetric unit (Fig. S1). In the complex structure, one Fab is bound to the top of each globular HA1 domain (Fig. 3a). The model of the 32D6-Fab comprises the heavy chain (residues 1\u2013230) and the light chain (residues 2\u2013217). Together, they bind to the HA1 domain (residues 63\u2013290). 32D6-Fab displays a typical immunoglobulin fold. The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are well defined11; the light-chain CDR loops are composed of residues 23\u201334 (CDR-L1), 47\u201353 (CDR-L2) and 93\u2013100 (CDR-L3), and the CDRs of the heavy chain are composed of residues 26\u201337 (CDR-H1), 52\u201360 (CDR-H2) and 100\u2013113 (CDR-H3) (Fig. 3b).",

The interatomic distances between the Fab region and the other HA1 domains are all greater than 5 \u00c5, and there appears to be no additional Fab-HA1 interaction of significance. However, again with steric hindrance consideration, if any other HA1 in an HA trimer is bound to another Fab, this second Fab would clash severely with the first one.

Subsequent conformational changes in the stem part of HA lead to membrane fusion of the virus and the host cell and the release of the viral content14. Influenza virus infection or vaccination can induce a robust antibody response15,16. Two types of antibodies have been identified: neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Conventional neutralizing antibodies bind to the globular head of HA and are often strain-specific. Certain other neutralizing antibodies bind to the more conserved stem region of HA and provide the broadly neutralizing activity to many different strains of flu viruses17\u201319. In general, anti-HA stem antibodies are less effective in viral neutralization, partly because the stem of HA is not as solvent-exposed for binding as the head. However, they can mediate non-neutralizing functions through antibody-dependent cellular-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate infected cells16,20,21. A number of broadly protective monoclonal antibodies against influenza viruses have been isolated and characterized to provide the information for vaccine design or be used as therapeutics20.",

The high specificity is reflected in the results of ELISA and cell-based assays. The affinity of 32D6 to HA, as measured using Biacore, is also strong, consistent with the identical binding mode of four independent 32D6-Fab/HA1 complexes that were observed in the crystal. Interestingly, unlike most other antibodies, 32D6 binds to HA without involving the RBS (Fig. S3a). The 32D6 interface is adjacent to the triad axis in an HA trimer, which cannot bind to additional copies of 32D6 (Fig. S3c). Therefore, the stoichiometry of 32D6-Fab to HA binding is 1 to 3, in contrast to the 1:1 ratio of most other known Fab-HA complexes (Fig. S3b). The HA-head-specific antibody S40 binds to the monomeric state of HA1 (S3cd)22. Although the RBS is not blocked directly by 32D6, with the bulky immunoglobulin attached to the top surface of HA trimer, it can no longer bind to the cell-surface receptor. Furthermore, at high antibody concentrations or high 32D6:HA ratios, each HA may tend to bind to one Fab. In this case, the HA trimer would be disrupted and, thus, unable to interact properly with the host receptor.",

The interactions include not only direct hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts but also several water-mediated hydrogen bonds. As an all-about medium, water molecules can indeed easily form strong hydrogen bonds. Another feature of particular note is the presence of three phenolic groups of tyrosine residues at the interface.

The underlying reason is that the mutations can alter the surface epitopes recognized by antibodies, which then lose the ability to bind strongly to the viruses. In this study, we isolated the human antibody 32D6, which is specific to the H1N1 influenza virus A/California/7/2009, and showed that 32D6 is effective in neutralizing several different isolates after the 2009 pandemic (also known as swine flu). By combining the biochemical and biophysical data with the X-ray crystallographic analysis, a good structural basis is laid down for the strain specificity of 32D6. It turned out that some mutations on the epitope surface do not affect the 32D6 binding. The finding that these mutations cannot escape the antibody binding and the elucidation of the specific epitope-CDR interactions should be useful for the detection and treatment of influenza virus infection.",
