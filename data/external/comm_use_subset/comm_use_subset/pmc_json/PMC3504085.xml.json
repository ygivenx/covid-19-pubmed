The major mature env gene products of REVs are the surface glycoprotein (gp90) and the transmembrane protein (gp20) [11], [12]. The gp90 protein containing both continuous and discontinuous epitopes functions as the immunodominant protein [13] and is responsible for eliciting REV antibodies. Previous studies indicated that the C-terminal epitope of gp90 was exposed on the outer surface of the REV-A-infected cell [12]. However, the epitope identified in REV gp90 protein has not been finely mapped, and the core sequence of the epitope needs to be determined.",

The concentration of the purified protein was determined using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Three successive rounds of biopanning were carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction manual. Brie\ufb02y, one well of a 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 10 \u00b5g/mL of mAb A9E8 in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.6) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by blocking with blocking buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.6, 0.02% NaN3, and 5 mg/ml BSA) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The phage library (1.5\u00d71011 phages/100 \u00b5L) was added to the blocked wells and the plate incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound phages were removed by successive washings with TBS buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) containing gradually increased concentrations (0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%) of Tween-20, and the bound phages were eluted by 0.2 M glycine-HCl containing 1 mg/mL BSA (pH 2.2) and immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1). The eluted phages were amplified by infecting E. coli (ER2738), and were titered on LB/IPTG/Xgal plates for the subsequent rounds of selection. The output to input ratio was calculated as follows: (titer of the amplified eluent phages/titer of the input phages (1.5\u00d71011))\u00d7100%.",
