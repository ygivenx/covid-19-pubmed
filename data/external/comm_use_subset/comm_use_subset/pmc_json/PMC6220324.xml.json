Among patients with respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and bronchiolitis are most commonly associated with hyponatremia3\u20135. However, the incidence of hyponatremia according to the etiological involvement of various microorganisms has not yet been studied. As a key event in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in patients with respiratory tract infections, a syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) caused by inflammation has been suggested2,4, but it has not been evaluated or validated in a sufficiently large number of children. Furthermore, few epidemiologic data are available on hyponatremia in children, and even less is known about hyponatremia in children with respiratory infections. Although hyponatremia is well-known to be associated with respiratory infections in children and adults, that connection has not been studied in a systematic fashion, and no data indicate whether the type of organism, number of organisms, location of infection, or degree of inflammation has any effect on the development of hyponatremia.",

Moreover, no report has considered the incidence of hyponatremia in children with respiratory tract infections according to the viral etiology, such as adenovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus. Our study population was the first and largest cohort in the literature evaluating the incidence of hyponatremia in children with respiratory tract infections according to the causal microorganisms or radiologic findings. We found an overall incidence of hyponatremia (<135 mEq/L) of 531 from among 3938 patients (13.5%), and we found no cases with a sodium level of less than 126 mEq/L or seizures. Although a previous small cohort suggested that there was no association between hyponatremia and etiology or radiological patterns in pneumonia3, we found that the incidence of hyponatremia was highest (20.7%) in children with adenovirus infection and lowest (7.8%) in those with mycoplasma infection. Although adenovirus was not the most common cause of infection, it was the leading cause of hyponatremia. It may be because the adenovirus infection has a more intenstive systemic inflammatory response as reflected in a greater CRP elevation and more fever than other respiratory viral infections.

Now, we suggest that in patients with respiratory tract infections, SIADH could be caused by the inflammation itself. Recent research revealed that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)\u22121\u03b2 and IL-6 are involved in the development of hyponatremia associated with inflammatory conditions, and they might be related to ADH secretion18\u201320. Landgraf et al.21 reported that IL-1\u03b2 stimulated both the central and peripheral release of vasopressin in rats. In addition, Palin et al.22 suggested that IL-6 induces activation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons in response to a lipopolysaccharide injection. Most notably, Mastorakos et al.23 demonstrated that AVP levels were elevated 2 hours after IL-6 injection in six patients. They suggested that IL-6 activated magnocellular AVP-secreting neurons and that it might be involved in the development of inappropriate AVP secretion. Previously, two small studies on pneumonia showed an inverse relationship between inflammatory markers and serum sodium levels3,24. In our large cohort, we demonstrated that serum sodium levels were inversely associated with the degree of inflammation (as demonstrated by WBC and CRP levels) in children with various respiratory tract infections, and our logistic regression analysis found that those levels independently predicted the development of hyponatremia. CRP is produced in hepatocytes in response to IL-6.",

Furthermore, the two prospective prevalence studies by Guppy et al.4,33 were on children with moderate to severe pneumonia and no clinical signs of dehydration. Therefore, doctors need to evaluate the clinical status of children with respiratory tract infections, such as oral intake, urine output, and signs of dehydration, before selecting appropriate maintenance intravenous fluids.

Understanding those characteristics provide insight for clinicians as they choose appropriate maintenance intravenous fluids. Furthermore, our results provide important clues for unraveling the mechanisms of hyponatremia in children hospitalized with respiratory tract infections.",

We defined upper respiratory infection as diseases including nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold but the chest X-ray showed normal findings34.Acute bronchiolitis: The diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis is typically made by clinical examination35. The bronchiolitis is blockage of the small airway in the lungs due to a viral infection It usually only occurs in children less than two years of age36. We defined acute bronchiolitis as a disease in which an infant under two years of age develops cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath over one or two days and the chest X-ray showed peribronchial thickening with or without hyperaeration.Acute bronchitis: Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs. Symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort37. We defined bronchitis as when patients have symptoms of bronchitis and the chest X-ray signs having bronchial wall thickening with increased bronchovascular markings, enlarged vessels without parenchymal lung infection.Interstitial pneumonia: the chest X-ray showed involvement of the areas between the alveoli. Interstitial pneumonia involves the areas in between the alveoli.Segmental or lobar pneumonia: It was defined when the chest X-ray showed the involvement of a single lobe or segment of the lung.",
