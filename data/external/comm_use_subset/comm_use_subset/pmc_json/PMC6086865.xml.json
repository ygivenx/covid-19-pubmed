            "text": "The process of viable cell clearance via phagocytosis by macrophages was termed by us as \u201cprogrammed cell removal\u201d (PrCR), which consists of multiple steps, including recognition, cellular engulfment, and intracellular digestion of the target cells1\u20134; and is conserved in many metazoan species5\u20138. The phagocytosis of cells undergoing PCD but that have not yet burst presumably prevents dying cell contents from causing inflammation4,9. While phagocytosis is often tied to programmed cell death (PCD) as it is essential for the clearance of apoptotic cells, called efferocytosis9, PrCR can occur in many circumstances independently of PCD1,3,4,10,11. We have shown that while the initiation of both PCD and PrCR can occur in aging neutrophils, when PCD is blocked by enforced expression of Bcl2, PrCR is not blocked and results in physiological removal of the neutrophils3. PrCR of living cells plays integral roles in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, hematopoiesis, tissue turnover, and cancer immunosurveillance1,3,12. During these process, viable target cells are cleared by macrophages in PrCR without PCD being induced. The efficacy of PrCR is determined by the balance between the recognition of pro-phagocytic \u201ceat me\u201d signals by macrophages and the inhibition of macrophages via the activation of anti-phagocytic \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d pathways by target cells. Cancer cells that have upregulated the \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signal CD47 inhibit PrCR by macrophages through signaling via macrophage signal regulatory protein \u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1)4,13,14. Blockade of CD47 on cancer cells leads to their recognition and phagocytosis via a cell surface form of the effector calreticulin (CRT) on macrophages1,2,15\u201317. The binding of the cancer cell\u2019s CD47 to the macrophage\u2019s SIRP\u03b1 receptor leads to SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 activation. These tyrosine phosphatases inhibit phagocytosis of macrophage-bound targets, at least in part by dephosphorylation of the actin-myosin-paxillin components required for engulfment and phagocytosis18. In the ER lumen, CRT functions as a chaperone to assist folding and assembly of a list of cell surface and secreted proteins, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I19, as well as ER resident proteins including other chaperones. CRT has also been found to regulate adhesion through integrin activation20 and integrins have been demonstrated to regulate CRT presentation on the cell surface21. Interaction between Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)22 and CRT on the cell surface has been implicated to signal through low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP1 or CD91) to induce focal adhesion disassembly. On the cell surface, CRT, C1q and CD91 receptors can form bridging complexes between macrophages and apoptotic cells, activating cellular machinery responsible for initiating phagocytosis of apoptotic cells10,23\u201325. Most CD47+ normal tissue cells do not become susceptible to PrCR when their CD47 signal is blocked, due to the lack of \u201ceat me\u201d signals that are necessary for macrophage recognition1,14. Thus the macrophage integrates pro- and anti-phagocytic signals for each cellular target that is then either phagocytosed or allowed to remain. Such a system of regulated opposing signals stringently defines the specificity and selectivity of PrCR for the clearance of unwanted cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a). It enables the induction of PrCR as a promising cancer treatment approach with high efficacy and minor non-specific toxicity.",

We showed that CRT moves from the endoplasmic reticulum of macrophages to the cell surface and/or is secreted following macrophage activation via toll like receptors2, a process that involves BTK phosphorylation of endoplasmic reticulum CRT, cleavage to separate the ER retention KDEL from the rest of the protein, and secretion to bridge macrophage CD91 prophagocytic receptors to appropriate target cells23\u201326.",

The expression of pathways regulating CRT binding in human cancers is correlated with the prognostic outcomes of patients with those cancers. The generation of CRT-binding sites on cancer cells can therefore enhance PrCR and could be important in developing highly efficient cancer treatment strategies. We show that this is a general mechanism of the interaction between macrophages and their target cells during PrCR in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In at least one case, the target cell induces cell-surface asialoglycoproteins by the function of neuraminidase 4.

These neutrophils are programmed to initiate age-dependent cell apoptotic processes, but to be phagocytosed by peritoneal macrophages before the explosive release of cellular contents that would cause inflammation; they burst inside of macrophages. We utilized a mouse model in which neutrophils are resistant to cell death by enforced expression of Bcl2 under the promoter MRP83,31. In agreement with our previous findings using this animal model, we found after thioglycollate induced peritonitis, the Bcl2-expressing neutrophils were resistant to apoptosis but were removed from the peritoneum with the same temporal dynamics as WT neutrophils undergoing cell death (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). These data indicate that aged neutrophils are programmed to be removed through PrCR; therefore, recognition of such target cells by macrophages is independent of their cell death. We reasoned that both cell death and PrCR programs were activated in wild-type (WT) neutrophils to promote their removal in the peritoneum, while only PrCR was activated in the Bcl2-protected neutrophils (Fig. 1c). To reveal potential pathways utilized by neutrophils to activate PrCR, we performed gene-expression profiling using RNAseq analysis to compare immature bone-marrow neutrophils to mature peritoneum-infiltrating neutrophils from WT and MRP8-Bcl2 mice (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b) at the time the neutrophils are starting to be removed from the peritoneum. We identified 333 overlapping genes that are upregulated in both WT and Bcl-2-expressing neutrophils that are potentially involved in PrCR (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Gene ontology enrichment pathway analyses revealed enriched pathways for MAPK signaling cascade, response to stress, and immune system processes (Fig. 1e).",

We evaluated the cell surface changes on neutrophils and macrophages for \u201ceat me\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals, such as CRT and CD47, respectively, that regulate PrCR after thioglycollate injection into MRP8-Bcl2 mice (Fig. 2a, b). We found that PrCR of neutrophils after thioglycolate injection correlated with their cell surface expression of CRT, but not CD47 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Interestingly, the cell surface levels of CRT increased on the neutrophils over time which correlated with the loss of neutrophils in the peritoneum. These data indicated that the cell surface was dynamically changing over time for PrCR to occur by promoting CRT accumulation on the neutrophil. To test this we isolated macrophages and neutrophils after thioglycollate injection over a period of time and determined the capacity of the cells to bind recombinant CRT. Both macrophages and neutrophils over time modified the cell surface to become more or less receptive to bind exogenous CRT (Fig. 2c). As the macrophages became less receptive to bind CRT neutrophils became more receptive to bind CRT. These data indicated that cell surface CRT regulated PrCR of neutrophils in this model. To test this we conducted a phagocytosis assay in which we blocked CRT recognition with a CRT blocking antibody and found that the phagocytosis of viable neutrophils by macrophages under this condition was significantly decreased (Fig. 2d). These data emphasize that PrCR is a dynamic process and PrCR of viable cells is dependent largely on the appearance of cell surface targets for CRT binding.",

Interestingly, neutrophils express extremely low levels of CRT while macrophages express high levels of CRT at both the RNA and protein levels, suggesting that surface CRT molecules on neutrophils may originate from macrophages (Fig. 3a\u2013c, Supplementary Fig. 2b). To test this we isolated peritoneal macrophages after thioglycollate injection and found that they readily secreted CRT (Fig. 3d). Stimulation of macrophages with LPS promoted CRT secretion, suggesting that macrophages utilize this mechanism of CRT secretion to promote PrCR (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). To further evaluate the source of CRT we cultured neutrophils or macrophages alone or together and measured cell surface CRT levels. Neutrophils did not alter the cell surface levels of CRT with respect to time when they were cultured alone (Supplementary Fig. 2e), however, co-culture of neutrophils and macrophages separated by a 0.4-\u03bcm pore membrane in a Boyden chamber showed a rapid and significant increase of cell surface CRT on neutrophils (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 2f). To determine the possibility that macrophages could produce this CRT and transfer it to neutrophils, we metabolically labeled activated macrophages with AHA (l-azidohomoalanine), a methionine analog, to label all newly synthesized proteins and then co-cultured these cells with neutrophils separated from the macrophages by a 0.4-\u03bcm pore membrane in a Boyden chamber (Fig. 3f). Through a \u201cclick\u201d reaction we were able to incorporate biotin into AHA positive protein on neutrophils. Immunoprecipitating CRT followed by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate and probing for biotin with streptavidin-HRP, we found biotin positive CRT on neutrophils, indicating that macrophages secreted CRT that decorated the surface of the deathless neutrophils, in the absence of contact between the macrophages and neutrophils (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 2g). Considering the possibilities that macrophages modify target cells through cytokine secretion, we examined the cytokine profiling of macrophages under different circumstances. Blocking CRT from macrophages didnot affect their cytokine profiling, except for an upregulation of MIP2 and GROA, two inflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Fig. 2h). In addition, no significant differences were observed regarding the cytokine secretion from macrophages when co-cultured in a Boyden chamber with neutrophils from WT or MRP8-Bcl2 mice (Supplementary Fig. 2i). These data indicate that direct modification of target cells via cytokines from macrophages is not the major mechanism to activate PrCR, however there is a dynamic interplay that promotes macrophages to secrete CRT and neutrophils to accumulate it.",

CRT functions as a lectin-chaperone in the ER, binding to newly synthesized glycoproteins to assist their folding and glycosylation32. Abnormal cell-surface glycosylation has been reported on apoptotic cells and on some cancer cells33,34. Therefore, we hypothesized that macrophage-secreted CRT maintains its lectin-like characteristics and binds to target cells via cell surface glycoproteins, perhaps the same glycans CRT binds to in the ER35,36. Thus we performed a screening experiment by probing a carbohydrate microarray37,38 that contains a large number of tumor glycan molecules, with recombinant CRT. We found that CRT selectively bound to the tumor-associated asialoglycans displaying the Tri-antennary and multivalent type II (Gal\u03b21 \u2192 4GlcNAc) chain epitopes (Tri/m-II) (Fig. 4a). Phytohaemagglutinin-L (PHA-L), a lectin that we previously demonstrated to specifically bind with the Tri/m-II dominant structure37,38 (Supplementary Fig. 3a), mimics CRT-binding kinetics on neutrophils and macrophages, demonstrating that over time more binding sites for CRT can be detected on neutrophils as less are detected on macrophages (Fig. 4b). We found that while newly produced neutrophils displayed few CRT-binding sites as compared to mature neutrophils, treatment with neuraminidase, a glycoside hydrolase enzyme which removes sialic acids from the terminal positions of glycans and exposes the cryptic Tri/m-II, dramatically increased CRT binding in both groups (Fig. 4c, d). These data confirm that CRT can bind to the viable cells to promote PrCR via asialoglycoproteins. We then examined CRT binding to cell surface glycan molecules, by using WT and mutant CHO cell lines that specifically express Tri/m-II and its derivatives39. Stronger binding of recombinant CRT was observed on CHO lines defective in the CMP-sialic acid transporter (Lec2) or UDP-GlcNAc 2 epimerase (Lec3) that expressed Tri/m-II, as compared to parental line, or the line defective in UDP-Gal translocase that expressed Tri/m-II capped by sialic acids or missing mannose on the outermost layer (Supplementary Fig. 3b).",

We found that activated macrophages but not cancer cells were able to release a significant amount of CRT into the medium when cultured (Supplementary Fig. 3c). In addition, we examined the presence of CRT-binding sites on a human AML cell line HL60 and a human colon cancer cell line SW620, and found that their endogenous CRT was either expressed at a low level or limited to the perinuclear regions while a significant portion of PHA-L staining were observed on the cell surface (Fig. 4e, f). Recombinant CRT bound to HL60 cells and colocalized with PHA-L on the cell surface, indicating that CRT is dependent on the presence of the cyptic Tri/m-II domain to bind (Supplementary Fig. 3d).",

Clearance of living cancer cells through PrCR was not due to induction of cell death. During PrCR, cancer cells were engulfed and digested inside macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 4c\u2013e). With the observation that CRT bridges target cells to macrophage for PrCR via asialoglycans on the cell surface, we wanted to next determine whether we can manipulate this asialoglycan epitope on any normal or neoplastic cell to promote PrCR. Indeed, we found that CRT binding to cancer cells was markedly enhanced after neuraminidase treatment and was specific to the asialoglycans (Fig. 5a\u2013d); and that such treatment significantly promoted phagocytosis of a wide range of human cancer cells by either human or mouse macrophages (Fig. 5e, f and Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c). To determine whether and which neuraminidase was responsible for promoting PrCR, we performed a screening experiment in which we suppressed the expression of the four different neuraminidase genes. We found that Neu4 played a major role in regulating cell surface asialoglycan epitopes for CRT binding to HL60 cells (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 5d\u2013e), and consistently, suppression of Neu4 expression significantly decreased phagocytosis of these cells (Fig. 5h). Taken together these data demonstrate that the regulation of CRT-binding asialoglycans on target cells is critical for their susceptibility to PrCR, and can be produced with cell intrinsic neuraminidases.",

Importantly, treatment of cancer cells with neuraminidase showed no effects on the intrinsic programs regulating cell viability and proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013f). When a human leukemia cell line (HL60) and a colon cancer cell line (DLD-1) were treated with neuraminidase and put into a long-term incubation with macrophages, significant reductions of cancer cell numbers were observed as compared to the control group (Supplementary Fig. 7a\u2013b). When we subcutaneously injected HL60 and DLD-1 cells treated with active or heat-inactivated neuraminidase into NSG mice, a dramatic inhibition of tumor engraftment and growth was observed for the cells treated with active neuraminidase, suggesting the exposure of CRT-binding sites likely promoted PrCR in vivo (Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Based on these findings, we reasoned that if the regulation of asialoglycans determines susceptibility to PrCR and therefore growth of tumor cells, then the expression of the genes that regulate the presence of asialoglycans could be correlated with disease outcomes or patient survival. To assess the correlation between the expression of CRT-binding sites and clinical outcomes, we used the PRECOG program41 to analyze published gene datasets containing corresponding patient survival data. We included in this analysis genes encoding sialytransferases or neuraminidases, which respectively attach or remove sialic acid to glycoproteins, thus masking or unmasking Tri/m-II epitopes42. Higher expression of genes promoting the removal of sialic acids correlated with an improved survival43,44 while higher expression of the genes enhancing sialic acid expression correlated with a worse outcome45,46 (Fig. 6c\u2013f).",

Therefore, we expanded our findings to hematopoiesis and found further evidence for a role of these CRT-binding sites in PrCR in HSCs. In the current study, we used the Gene Expression Commons47 platform containing gene expression datasets for different cell types in mouse and human to analyze expression of sialytransferases and neuraminidases in HSCs and their differentiated progeny. HSCs showed significantly higher expression of sialytransferases and lower expression of neuraminidases, consistent with their longer survival than their differentiated progeny (Supplementary Fig. 7d\u2013k). We next examined CRT surface levels and availability of binding sites in acute myelogenous leukemia, as a pathological model of hematopoiesis. We fractionated patient samples into residual normal HSCs, multipotent progenitors (MPPs), leukemia stem cells (LSCs), and blasts cells. Importantly, staining of surface CRT and binding of PHA-L, significantly correlated in all cell populations, indicating the dependence of CRT cell surface binding on asialoglycoproteins in normal and neoplastic cells (Fig. 6g, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Consistently, much stronger PHA-L staining was found on blast cells, which have the shortest half-life as compared to MPPs, LSCs, and HSCs (Fig. 6g).",

We discovered here a CRT-mediated detection mechanism used by macrophages with stringent specificity that is responsible for the ability to distinguish wanted vs unwanted (damaged, dysfunctional, aged, or harmful) cells. We discerned that CRT is secreted by macrophages and binds to asialoglycoproteins on receptive target cells. Non-receptive cells have asialoglycoproteins that are \u201ccapped\u201d with sialic acid that must be removed by neuraminidases before CRT is able to bind and initiate PrCR. Cancer cells express significantly higher level of both CRT-binding molecules and sialic acids than do normal cells52,53, implying an evolving process during cancer development, in which cancer cells respond to internal signals, e.g., those that also induce cell death, to produce surface asialoglycoproteins, perhaps via secreted neuraminidases, or co-localization of neuramindase with post-golgi vesicles containing glycoproteins, and passively acquire \u201ceat me\u201d CRT signals. Successful cancer clones possess mechanisms to modify these signals or to express CD47 to evade PrCR. We have recently published that PDL1/PD154 and MHCI\u03b22/LILRB155 are also active as tumor ligands and macrophage receptors that provide \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals, pointing to the importance of this system. This new knowledge that CRT binds to asialoglycoproteins, which are often hidden by sialic acid, is the first step in dissecting the mechanism of PrCR initiation, which can be targeted in disease states such as cancer alone, or in combination with CD47 inhibition.",

We showed in 1994 that wild-type neutrophils in response to sterile inflammation come into the peritoneal cavity from the bone marrow, peaking at 4 h3. At that time they are alive, and if incubated with macrophages, are not eaten. We now know they are CD47+ and CRT low. Between 12 and 24 h after thioglycollate administration, wild-type neutrophils are undergoing endonucleolytic degradation of their chromosomal DNA to nucleosome size fragments, but are not yet dead. If they are incubated with macrophages they are phagocytosed before they burst. The Bcl2+ neutrophils, which are resistant to PCD and are, therefore, not undergoing DNA degradation, are equally phagocytosed under inflammatory conditions when they are alive. All detectable neutrophils from either WT or Bcl2-expressing mice are gone by 24\u201348 h after thioglycollate-mediated inflammation. The rapid upregulation of CRT-binding sites on neutrophils within 24 h of maturation and recruitment to the peritoneum during induced sterile peritonitis implicates an increase in neuraminidase activity more than a decrease in sialyltransferase activity as a likely mechanism, insofar as the turnover of cell surface glycoproteins is slower56,57. An analogous phenomenon that reinforces this conclusion about factors contributing to PrCR and a shorter life-span of cells occurs in HSCs vs their differentiated progeny58. Here, the HSCs have a dramatic up- or down-regulation, respectively, of sialytransferases and neuraminidases, leading to decreased CRT-binding sites and enhanced anti-PrCR protection for these long-lasting stem cells, which is consistent with their remarkably low turnover58,59.",

Exposure of asialoglycoproteins leads to decoration of target cells with CRT, which is secreted by macrophages and eventually triggers PrCR (schematically summarized in Supplementary Fig. 9). Examination of CRT-binding sites on cancer cells demonstrated its prognostic power and a potential for creating new treatments by increasing the number of such sites to promote PrCR of a wide range of human cancer cells or other diseases. Understanding such mechanisms is critical for development of novel immunotherapies by fully exploiting PrCR. The elaboration of the PrCR signal [unopposed by CD47] in oligopotent hematopoietic progenitors in at least some myelodysplastic syndrome patients, in whom >95% of their HSC are from the single cell with a chromosomal anomaly such as monosomy 7, demonstrates that the PrCR signal can be elicited in a single differentiation step; the transition from MDS to AML is accompanied with upregulation of CD4759. Finally, a large number of human cellular degenerative diseases exist, and the mechanism of cell loss is generally speculated to be PCD; here, we provide another mechanism\u2014PrCR\u2014that also could be responsible.",

First, formation of a mutant calreticulin is the critical lesion in up to half the patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, MPN, and nearly all of the rest are due to a Jak2 activating mutation62. The first clue to this puzzle is that the mutant calreticulin is one that produces a frameshift in which the c-terminal domain loses Ca2+ binding negative charged amino acids and replaces them with positive charged amino acids, and second, the frameshifted mutant CRT does not have a KDEL domain. The mutant calreticulin binds to the ectodomain of c-mpl, which signals via Jak262. We propose that the binding of the CRT to c-mpl involves its lectin specificity, and that these c-mpl molecules are asialo-forms rather than sialylated proteins, and therefore the binding which leads to jak2 signalling could be wholly or in part due to the lectin domain of secreted CRT-binding asialo c-mpl in a way that triggers dimerization and signaling. Perhaps the new c-terminal domain also has c-mpl binding, but it may be that crosslinking asialoglycans on the protein is sufficient. This could imply that the MPN forms of CRT are dimers via the new c-terminal domain. It shall also be important to test whether the glycan portion of c-mpl is the CRT-binding site, and if the asialoglycan is also on other cell surface molecules, or only on c-mpl.",

PHA is a T-cell mitogen, and in the context of this paper, likely binds to asialoglycan residues on mitogenic T-cell surface molecules, now known to include the TCR, associated CD3 chains, and CD28. The erythrocyte specificity of PHA binding could also be via asialoglycans.

Phagocytic index was quantified by FACS analyses and calculated with the number of macrophages that phagocytosed target cells (F4/80+GFP+)/divided by the number of total macrophages (F4/80+). In each experiment, phagocytic indexes were normalized to the maximal indexes. Alternatively, cells were loaded with LysoTracker Red DND-99 probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in growth medium at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Cells were then washed once with growth medium and twice with IMDM medium, and incubated with macrophages for phagocytosis. Excitation and Emission for LysoTracker probes are 577 and 590 nm, respectively. LysoTracker probes are excited in a PH-dependent manner and are highly selective for acidic organelles. Cancer cells loaded with LysoTracker probes become positive in PE channel when they are engulfed and delivered to acidic organelles in macrophages for digestion. After incubation with target cells, macrophages that are F4/80+PE+ are the ones that engulfed target cells.",
