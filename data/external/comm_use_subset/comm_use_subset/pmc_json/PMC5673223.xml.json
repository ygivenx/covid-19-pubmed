            "text": "Currently, there are three types of influenza vaccine available in the market: an inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV), a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) and a recombinant vaccine. The IIV is a good inducer of systemic immune response but it is ineffective at stimulating mucosal immune response [3]. LAIV on the other hand, induces both systemic and mucosal immune responses [4]. However, there is an associated risk of the attenuated virus reverting back to its highly virulent form and thus causing an infection [3]. A case of LAIV transmission to a recipient was previously reported [4]. In addition, a study had shown that LAIV increased risk of wheezing within 42 days after vaccination in children <12-months-old [5]. Recombinant vaccine is potentially of advantage especially in the event of a pandemic due to its quick production potential [6]. This vaccine is administered intramuscularly and therefore, induces immune response similar to IIV [7]. However, a few serious adverse events associated with this vaccine such as vasovagal syncope, pericardial effusion and Bell\u2019s palsy were previously reported [8]. Taken together, influenza vaccines that are currently available present several drawbacks, including their limited ability at stimulating mucosal immunity without compromising safety issues. As influenza virus initiates infection at the respiratory tract mucosal surface, it would be advantageous to have a vaccine that is able to induce mucosal immune response, mainly the secretory IgA (sIgA).",

More recently, L. lactis is being extensively explored as effective oral-based vaccine vehicles to deliver antigens of several viruses [9\u201315], bacteria [16\u201320] and parasites [21].

The amount of HA1 bound on L. lactis was improved using a single-chain variable fragment peptide linker (Gly4Ser)3, to link HA1 to the AcmA binding domain. In the present study, we extended our previous work by optimizing the binding parameters, the amount of HA1 recombinant protein added to L. lactis, the duration of binding and the buffer used for binding. We then assessed the specific immune response elicited upon oral immunization of the non-recombinant L. lactis surface displaying HA1 (LL-HA1/L/AcmA) in mice. In addition, the protective efficacy of LL-HA1/L/AcmA against a lethal dose challenge with influenza virus was also assessed.",

In study group A, mice (n = 8) were immunized orally with 0.1 ml of 1\u00d71010 CFU of LL-HA1/L/AcmA (25 \u00b5g/dosage) or endotoxin-free PBS by intra-gastric lavage for 3 consecutive days. The immunization regimen was repeated thrice at 2 weeks intervals. In study group B, mice (n = 8) were immunized orally with 0.1 ml of 5\u00d71010 CFU of LL-HA1/L/AcmA (125 \u03bcg/dosage), HA1/L/AcmA (125 \u03bcg/dosage) or endotoxin-free PBS for 3 consecutive days. The immunization regimen was repeated thrice at 2 weeks intervals. As a positive control, HA1/L/AcmA (50 \u03bcg/dosage) emulsified with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA), HA1/L/AcmA-FA, was administered subcutaneously to a group of mice (n = 8). The immunization was repeated thrice at 2 weeks intervals using incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) instead of CFA.",

Although mice immunized subcutaneously with HA1/L/AcmA-FA stimulated good serological immune responses, however, it did not stimulate significant level of sIgA in the faecal sample. Taken together, the results suggested that LL-HA1/L/AcmA is a potent inducer of mucosal immunity in the gastrointestinal tract upon oral immunization of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in mice, and L. lactis delivery platform is capable in stimulating mucosal immunity in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Changes in body weight and survival of mice were monitored daily as measure of disease severity. All non-immunized mice were susceptible to influenza infection, showing sickness such as decreased activity and huddling by day 3 post-infection (p.i.). Severe sickness such as hunched posture, ruffled fur and increased body weight loss of up to 20% were observed within day 8 p.i. (Fig 4A). The rate of body weight loss calculated by linear regression analysis was -2.7\u00b10.1 and the maximum percentage change in body weight observed in individual mice over 14 days after lethal challenge with influenza virus was 20.6\u00b10.1% (Table 1). In contrast, body weight of mice in LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group decreased until day 6 and 7 p.i., respectively, after which mice in both groups recorded an increase in their body weight till day 14 p.i. (Fig 4A). A lower rate of body weight loss was observed in the LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated (-0.3\u00b10.1) and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group (-0.6\u00b10.1), respectively, as compared to non-immunized mice (-2.7\u00b10.1) (Table 1). Significantly lower percentage change in body weight was noted in LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated (11.6\u00b12.5%) (p<0.01) and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group (15.7\u00b11.8%) (p<0.05) than the non-immunized mice. In contrast, the positive control group, which were mice immunized subcutaneously with HA1/L/AcmA-FA did not show body weight loss upon exposure to influenza virus (Fig 4A). The mice instead recorded rate of body weight gain of 0.2\u00b10.0 (Table 1). In addition, there was significantly lower percentage change in body weight (p<0.001) in this HA1/L/AcmA-FA-treated group (1.5\u00b10.7%) compared to the non-immunized group (Table 1). These data indicated that mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA or HA1/L/AcmA resulted in significantly less morbidity upon exposure to influenza virus. Mice in the HA1/L/AcmA-treated group suffered more severe sickness as presented by highest rate of body weight loss and percentage change in body weight among the treated group. Subcutaneous immunization of HA1/L/AcmA-FA in mice did not result in any morbidity upon exposure to virus. Collectively, it was demonstrated that oral immunization of LL-HA1/L/AcmA is superior in reducing morbidity upon exposure to influenza virus compared to the HA1/L/AcmA without L. lactis as a carrier.",

As such, while antiviral therapy has been available, vaccination is still the most effective strategy for the prevention and control of influenza. There is growing interest in mucosal vaccines due to their advantages over conventional injectable vaccines. Side effects associated with conventional vaccines, such as local reactions at the injection site are potentially reduced with implementation of mucosal vaccines. The need for needles during vaccine administration is also avoided, eliminating the possibility of blood transmissible infections [29, 30]. Moreover, mucosal vaccination can be easily administered without a trained personnel, thus considered a more favorable approach for mass vaccination [31].",

It has been reported to be more important than IgG in the protection of upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and trachea [34], primarily by reducing virus attachment and preventing internalization of the virus at the mucosal surfaces, thereby preventing infection [34, 35]. In addition, sIgA provides cross-protection against other subtypes of influenza virus [33, 36\u201338].

The presence of this antibiotic resistance gene could eventually be a matter of concern, particularly the transfer of its antibiotic resistance gene to another organism when L. lactis is released in the field [39]. An approach utilizing a non-recombinant L. lactis will be advantageous as it is likely to overcome this concern, and hence be better accepted by the public.

The result is consistent with previous studies showing that oral immunization with L. lactis displaying antigens induced sIgA at sites other than the gastrointestinal tract [22, 24, 40\u201342]. The results of sIgA at other mucosal sites could be due to intestinally derived IgA plasma cells expressing CCR10 homing receptor that migrated towards the CCL28 cytokine, which is secreted by mucosal epithelial tissues present at sites such as large intestine, stomach, trachea, bronchi, mammary glands and salivary glands [43]. These migrated intestinal IgA plasma cells then populate the mucosal sites, and secrete HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA. Therefore, oral immunization could lead to presence of antigen specific IgA in both intestinal and non-intestinal mucosal tissues [44, 45].",

The observed specific sIgA response upon oral immunization with LL-HA1/L/AcmA was consistent with our previously reported findings in which specific sIgA was detected upon oral immunization with recombinant L. lactis expressing HA1 [28].",

The result obtained was in contrast with several studies that had demonstrated oral immunization of antigen using L. lactis elicited specific IgG in serum in addition to specific sIgA in faecal extract [9, 11, 12, 46\u201348]. Although mice immunized orally with LL-HA1/L/AcmA elicited significant mucosal immune response only, and not systemic immune response, more importantly, it was demonstrated that LL-HA1/L/AcmA could provide up to 88% protection in mice against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. An earlier study on mice immunized orally with L. lactis expressing HA of influenza H5N1 showed significant increase in specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA, but IgA was not detected in tracheal mucosal and only 30% mice were protected upon viral challenge [46]. Therefore, in this study, the protection in mice was likely due to the presence of sIgA specific against HA1 in the respiratory tract, which was possibly activated upon oral immunization. It would be beneficial to evaluate the neutralization ability of the sIgA induced by LL-HA1/L/AcmA by measuring its capability to inhibit influenza virus A (H1N1) in vitro, however it could not be examined due to the limitation of samples obtained. Besides sIgA, there are other protective mechanisms, such as T cell-mediated immunity, which may play a protective role by clearing the established infection and reducing disease severity [49, 50]. Therefore, additional studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanism of protection by LL-HA1/L/AcmA. Nonetheless, the findings obtained highlight the importance of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract in according protection against influenza virus challenge.",

Mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA also suffered less sickness and body weight loss upon lethal challenge with influenza virus. These results were in agreement with several earlier studies that oral immunization with L. lactis displaying antigen is more efficient than a simple antigen alone oral immunization [15, 47, 51]. The potential adjuvant effects of using L. lactis in oral immunization could be attributed to the presence of bacterial components that can stimulate innate immunity, leading to adaptive immunity [52]. Besides, L. lactis presenting heterologous antigen as a particle to the immune system, is more superior to soluble antigen presented on its own, particularly if the vaccine is to be delivered orally [53]. As the present study is focused only on the protection of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in mice against homosubtypic influenza virus challenge, heterosubtypic influenza virus challenge can now be explored. Further investigation to surface display antigens from multiple influenza subtypes on a single L. lactis cell as candidate vaccine to render protection against a broad range of influenza subtypes can also be performed.",
