The new saying clearly indicates that microbes have determined in many ways the evolution of the human species. At a first level, bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea have literally become a part of us, forming the so called microbiota. A recent study has defined more precisely the number of bacteria present in our body, which is in the order of 39 trillion cells (2). Since the estimated number of human cells in the body (about 84% of which are red blood cells) is in the order of 30 trillion, the ratio between bacterial and human cells is about 1.3. The numbers may vary significantly from person to person and could change significantly with each defecation, ranging from 30 to 50 trillion in each individual. Women may also have a higher ratio of bacterial vs. human cells, because they have fewer red blood cells. This evaluation does not take into account fungi, viruses, and archaea, which all make up the human microbiota and would increase the ratio of microbes to human cells. Thus, we can consider ourselves like superorganisms, in which microbes do many jobs in exchange for the raw materials and the shelter their host provides. This alone shows how closely host and microbiota have co-evolved.",

Over the entireness of the three million years of our species\u2019 evolution, life expectancy has always been between 25 and 35 years until very recently, and infections have been the main regulators of our life span. By learning from observation of nature, human beings progressively improved their living conditions to the point that about 250 years ago life expectancy started to increase. In 1900, mankind had already reached a life expectancy of approximately 50 years (3). Nowadays, a child born in a high-income country can expect to live 85 years. The additional 35 years of life that we gained during the last century are substantially due to the conquest of infectious diseases, which used to kill 50% of people before the age of 20. These were viral diseases such as smallpox, rabies, measles, rubella, mumps, and bacterial infections such as diphtheria, tetanus, typhoid fever, and cholera (4). This result has been achieved primarily by improved hygiene, but also by treatment of infectious diseases with antibiotics and by their prevention throughout vaccination. As negative control of this important result, we have to consider the poor areas of our planet, where hygiene, vaccines, and antibiotics are not properly used even today. As a consequence, in these areas infections still represent a major cause of mortality, maintaining life expectancy below 50 years.",

The first observation that microbes are able to produces substances capable of killing pathogens came from the Italian scientist Vincenzio Tiberio in 1895, who showed the antibacterial activity of a natural substance produced by molds (5). Then Ernest Duchesne in France published in his doctorate thesis presented in 1897 (6) that the mold Penicillium glaucum possesses antibacterial properties. It was Alexander Flaming in 1928 that succeeded in definitely identifying the world\u2019s first antibiotic. It was a substance isolated from the mold Penicillium notatum, defined as benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) (7). The first industrial production came however after Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain continued the work of Flaming in Oxford. Thus, after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 a mass production could be initiated. By 1944, enough penicillin was produced to treat the wounded soldiers in the Allied forces. The 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine was assigned to Flaming, Florey and Chain. The era of antibiotics had begun, and several other molecules produced by microbes followed penicillin. With antibiotics, mankind could claim an historical success in the eternal war against pathogens. However, it was soon clear that antibiotics were not the definitive weapon.",

In a few cases, bacteria became resistant to most of the available antibiotics and are on the verge of becoming untreatable. As a consequence, AMR is perhaps the most alarming emerging problem of infectious diseases. Globally, AMR already causes 700,000 deaths/year, and the forecast is that in 2050 it will cause 10 million deaths/year, higher than the 8.2 million deaths caused by cancer today. As an example we can look at S. pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus, a human pathogen that is the major cause of community-acquired pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, bacteremia, and otitis media (9, 10). In the past, most strains of S. pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin, whereas today penicillin resistance goes from 5 up to 60% in various parts of the world. Thus, with time old antibiotics become less effective or lose efficacy, making the search for new molecules with different mechanisms of action a priority (11).",

The interest in fighting the increase in AMR has intensified, and new incentives for research and development of new drugs have been deployed.

The list highlights in particular the threat of Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. These bacteria have built-in abilities to find new ways to resist treatment and can pass along genetic material that allows other bacteria to become multi-drug-resistant. The WHO list is divided into three categories according to the urgency of intervention, of critical, high and medium priority. The most critical group includes multidrug resistant bacteria that pose a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes and among patients whose care requires devices (such as ventilators and blood catheters). The group encompass Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and various Enterobacteriaceae (including Klebsiella, E. coli, Serratia, and Proteus). These bacteria can cause severe and often deadly infections such as bloodstream infections and pneumonia, and have become resistant to a large number of antibiotics, including carbapenems and third generation cephalosporins (the best available antibiotics for treating multi-drug resistant bacteria). The second and third tiers in the list\u2014the high and medium priority categories\u2014 include other increasingly drug-resistant bacteria that cause more common diseases, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the agent of gonorrhea) and Salmonella (causing food poisoning). This WHO action intends to promote initiatives of basic science and advanced R&D from both publicly funded agencies and the private sector, aiming to discover new antibiotics.\u201d",

However, we must remember that TB now kills more people than any other pathogen (1.8 million in 2015), and it is therefore a most urgent priority. Other bacteria that are not included in WHO list, such as Group A and group B Streptococcus and Chlamydia, have low levels of resistance to existing treatments and do not currently pose a significant public health threat, but there is a risk that with time also these pathogens may become resistant. The list was developed in collaboration with the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of T\u00fcbingen, Germany, using a multi-criteria decision analysis technique vetted by a group of international experts. The criteria for selecting pathogens in the list were: a) how deadly the infections they cause are; b) whether their treatment requires long hospital stays; c) how frequently they are resistant to existing antibiotics when people in communities catch them; d) how easily they are transmitted between animals, from animals to humans, and from person to person; e) whether they can be prevented (e.g., through good hygiene and vaccination); f) how many treatment options remain; and g) whether new antibiotics to treat them are already in the R&D pipeline.\u201d",

This analysis shows that resistance to antibiotics inevitably emerges every time that a new antibiotic is introduced, starting a process of selection in the target bacteria that will eventually make that antibiotic useless. The consequence is that there is a continuous need of a fresh supply of novel antibiotics, to maintaining effectiveness of the therapeutic treatment. This strategy worked very well up to 1970s, when the identification of new antibiotics was abundant. However, since then the pipeline for new antibiotics has been drying out, and we have not been able to discover new classes of antibiotics (11). In marked contrast, Kennedy and Read show that we can use vaccines for a long time, generating no or very little resistance (14). Thus, vaccines can control infections over a long period of time without becoming obsolete. This occurs because vaccines work prophylactically and prevent the start of infections, while drugs work therapeutically on an ongoing infection in which bacteria proliferate and mutate, allowing the drug to select the resistant variants.",

It can be concluded that selection has fewer opportunities to act upon vaccination than with antibiotic treatment. Still, both vaccines and antibiotics are very important in the control of infections. Table 1 reports the major differences in the mode of action of vaccines and antibiotics and provides information that can guide us to take advantage of their strengths and to minimize their weaknesses. From this comparison, it is evident that antibiotics are the only life-saving tool that we can use during acute bacterial infections, although their often improper or excessive use is causing bacterial resistance in a continuously increasing fashion. The availability of vaccines to control infections may allow us to decrease the use of antibiotics and to generate less AMR. This will permit a more efficient use of existing and new antibiotics during acute infections. As shown in Figure 1, there are, however, some cases in which resistance evolved after vaccination. This can be due to several causes, such as the fact that vaccines can protect from disease but may not have the capability to completely prevent pathogen colonization and transmission, as in the case of the acellular pertussis vaccine, or it can be caused by serotype replacement after vaccination with vaccines not including all serotypes, as in the case of the vaccines against S. pneumoniae. Thus, even for vaccines the search for better protective antigens (Ag) is very important, particularly for antibiotic-resistant infections.",

Each annual meeting aimed to analyze the state-of-the-art of important themes in the field of vaccines and expand the vision for the years to come. The participation of excellent speakers and expert discussants ensured the high quality of the meetings, whose conclusions were published in international journals (15\u201324). The meetings were organized close to a popular event, the horse race named \u201cPalio di Siena,\u201d for which the town is worldwide famous. Thus, those meetings were called the Palio Meetings. More recently, with the acquisition of the vaccine company in Siena by GSK, the venue of the meeting was moved to other locations in USA and Europe, but the traditional name was maintained. The topic of the meetings can vary but the mission is always based on one or more of the following pillars: (1) must define the state-of-the-art of cutting edge topics related to infectious diseases; (2) must advocate science policies to promote progress and improvement in human health; and (3) must be a strategic forum aimed to build new initiatives. Table 2 reports the topics of the Palio Meetings during the years.",

The London meeting provided a clear consensus that vaccines complement the actions of antibiotics and can contribute to control, reduce, and sometimes eliminate diseases caused by AMR pathogens, more than any other intervention. Thus, the main scope of the 2017 Palio Meeting was to build on the conclusions of the London meeting, and posed the question of how can we make vaccines achieve their full potential and become one of the top tools to tackle AMR. Indeed, the discussion led to conclude that there is a need to make stronger, more evidence-based cases supporting the importance of vaccines in AMR prevention (24).",

Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the high use of antibiotics, prescribed to treat opportunistic bacterial infections in people weakened by flu, is prevented when flu vaccines are employed. There is a need to make public the data generated by vaccine companies on vaccine effectiveness against AMR, and to continuously monitor the circulation of resistant bacterial strains.

Another critical difference between antibiotics and vaccines is the rate of discovery of new effective molecules. In the past, new antibiotics were identified and regularly reached the clinic, particularly in the three decades after 1950. Since then, however, very few new molecules have been introduced in the clinical use. An opposite situation occurred in the case of vaccines, which have been developed at an increasing speed. As for today, 22 new vaccines became available since 1980. This is a consequence of the introduction of new technologies, such as recombinant DNA, that led to the generation of new synthetic sequences. Therefore, we have obtained a great reduction of the incidence of bacterial meningitis (caused by Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis) thanks to a new generation of very effective conjugated vaccines, generated by chemical technologies for covalently linking bacterial polysaccharides to proteins. More recently, genomic sequencing opened the access to a higher level in vaccine design, since it made possible to predict the thousands of proteins encoded by bacterial genes, and to identify those likely exposed on the cell surface, in search of new vaccine candidates. This approach, defined as \u201creverse vaccinology\u201d has resulted in a first important protein vaccine against meningococcus B that is now in use worldwide (29). Finally, a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating the induction of a protective immune response has opened the possibility to introduce, in vaccine formulations, new moieties that can make them more effective. These substances are defined with the general name of adjuvants.",

What makes them effective is their capability to reach and poison targets across the strong barrier of the bacterial cell wall and avoid being ejected by potent efflux pumps. Any biochemical modification of the target microorganism can make the antibiotic inefficient. Among billions of bacteria present during an infection, such modifications can stochastically arise frequently. Vaccines are molecules with the capacity to evoke in the host a protective activity against infections. They do so by interacting with the immune system of the host, a system that during evolution has developed sophisticated mechanisms to recognize and destroy any kind of \u201cdanger\u201d agents, essentially by distinguishing molecules that are different from self. The human immune system can potentially recognize any Ag in the universe, even those never encountered before, thanks to its complex gene rearrangement mechanisms. Thus, it is quite obvious that the potential of vaccines to protect us is extraordinary. And the more we learn about our immune system, the better we can design strategies and develop tools to protect our health from infections. For instance, in some cases it is now possible to cure established infections by administering the patient with specific antibodies produced in the lab with new technologies. In a way, these anti-infective antibodies could be considered as a new kind of antibiotic family, even though much more expensive.",

The vaccine was still produced with traditional techniques and was composed by bacterial outer membrane vesicles. Recent studies in the population vaccinated with this vaccine revealed protection against gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection induced by N. gonorrhoeae that is becoming resistant to antibiotics (38). The reason of this protection is likely due to the fact that bacteria causing meningitis and gonorrhea are genetically related. Furthermore, the current evidence shows that existing pneumococcal vaccines reduce AMR, due to the fact they prevent infection thereby reducing the carriage and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Another example is the influenza vaccine that indirectly reduces the incidence of fever and sickness, thereby minimizing the use and, more often, the misuse of antibiotics.",

Nowadays, immune antibodies can be produced only in low amounts and with high costs. At the beginning of the last century, immune antibodies able to neutralize bacterial toxins were produced in big animals and largely employed, and contributed to building an industrial sector (\u201cserum\u201d institutes) that evolved in today\u2019s vaccine industry. We hope that the new technologies will allow us to revive the serology concept and make it a new tool against infection.",

As already mentioned, a large component of our body is bacteria (over 50%). An increasing number of studies indicate that gut microbiota is influencing our health and pathological conditions (39). Intestinal microbes can influence host energy metabolism (40), intestinal epithelial proliferation (41), and immune responses (42). It has been shown that the microbiota composition could influence vaginosis (43), obesity (44), inflammatory bowel disease (45), functional bowel disorders (46), allergies (47), and other diseases. An increasing number of studies suggest we can educate our microbiota to combat metabolic and chronic diseases. Could it be also the case in fighting infections?",

Flow path representation of how the analysis of the human B cell repertoire leads to the identification of protective Abs from vaccinated or infected subjects. From upper left: Single B cell sorting and culturing enables a direct screening and selection of naturally produced Abs with desired functionality, and the recovery of the corresponding Ig gene sequences. This approach allows us to interrogate single-sorted B cells through direct screening of Ab functionality. From the recovered Ig sequences, we can produce the Abs of interest as recombinant proteins, and fine-tune their properties. The structural characterization of recombinant monoclonal Abs bound to their target antigen (Ag) leads to a detailed definition of the protective epitope. The right inset shows the co-crystal structure of an Ag\u2013Ab (Fab) complex, identifying a protective epitope (red). Engineering of the protective epitope can lead to the design of a novel optimized immunogen. For example, we can mount the epitope in an oriented multi-copy array on a nanoparticle that will act as carrier and increase an epitope-focused immune response (\u201cstructure-based Ag design\u201d). The new Ag can be developed with the best formulation or delivery system to then be tested in humans (from Ref. (30) with permission of the publisher).",
