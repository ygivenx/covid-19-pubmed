In humans, four respiratory coronaviruses, namely human coronavirus (HCoV) -229E [2], -OC43 [3], -NL63 [4], and -HKU1 [5], are endemic worldwide. These four common strains cause diseases from mild, febrile upper respiratory tract illnesses to severe outcomes, such as croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, and attribute to about 10% of all upper and lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children [1,6]. In 2003, a previously unknown coronavirus caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans [7,8]. More recently, the novel betacoronavirus species HCoV-EMC was identified from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia [9].",

On the other hand, serological assays for detection of antibody to HCoV are more complex to establish [1,6]. However, determining the levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in appropriate serum or plasma samples allows the researcher to define the point in time of primary infection as well as exposure rates; seroepidemiological studies are also important tools for HCoV infection diagnosis and research[6,13-17]. Previous reports have indicated that immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) for the detection of seroconversion with IgG antibodies against the main structural (N and S) proteins of SARS-CoV are useful for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV infection [18,19]. Little is currently known about the prevalence of anti-S antibodies specific for non-SARS HCoV infection among children and adults. We propose that an IFA for the detection of IgG against structural (N and S) proteins of non-SARS HCoV may be suitable for seroepidemiological studies.",

The infected cells were incubated with anti-S mouse serum (1:500) for 1 h, and then incubated with FITC-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L; Zhongahan Co., Beijing, China) for 30 min. Positive foci were identified by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) after Evans blue duplicate staining.",

The cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, then permeabilised using 0.2% TritonX-100 and washed three times with PBS. The anti-S-specific antibodies in sera (diluted to 1:20) were quantified using 1:100-diluted FITC-labelled sheep anti-human IgG (H + L; Zhongahan Co., Beijing, China) or 1:40-diluted FITC-labelled anti-human IgM (\u03bc-chain-specific), and the slide was viewed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Serum samples that reacted with HCoV S protein at a dilution of >1:20 were considered positive for anti-S antibodies when duplicate or triple test was consistent.

All four non-SARS-related S proteins showed band sizes that were consistent with the predicted molecular mass (150\u2013200 kDa), presumably reflecting glycosylated forms of S protein. In addition, the expression of recombinant HCoV S proteins was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using specific anti-S mouse serum, as noted above (Figure 1C).

No cross-staining was observed when other HCoV antiserum was used as the primary antibody, specifically concerning virus-antibody pairs of subgroup 229E/NL63 (alphacoronaviruses) or OC43/HKU1(batacoronaviruses).

Four endemic non-SARS-related HCoVs (HCoV-OC43,-229E,-NL63 and \u2013HKU1) are major contributors to respiratory tract infections and other clinical manifestations [6,11-17,22]. However, specific and feasible serological surveys of these HCoVs, especially for HCoV-NL63 and \u2013HKU1, have to date been reported among the general population only rarely in China. Spike is the major structural protein of HCoVs [1,10]. It contains multiple conformational epitopes that are major inducers of antibody neutralisation, and it has the lowest sequence conservation among coronavirus proteins, rendering it a specific target for serodiagnosis [1,10,23-26]. We chose the HCoV S gene for recombinant expression on the basis of current knowledge of immunodominant SARS-CoV antigens, which belongs to the same virus family as HCoV. Previous studies of SARS-CoV serology have successfully used the S protein in enzyme immunoassays, immunoblots, and IFA [23-27]. In addition, comparison of the S protein sequences of four HCoVs revealed that these proteins share <35% similarity [1,10]. We hypothesised that the difference in the amino acid sequence is sufficiently high to ensure the usefulness of S protein as a specific antigen for antibody detection. The native surface S protein expressed in 293 T cells can be recognised in post-infection population serum by IFA. Some reports indicated that this cell-based S protein expression system can differentiate false-positive ELISA results using the more cross-reactive nucleoprotein antigen[18,24]. Furthermore, Woo et al. reported that the rS-based IgM ELISA is more sensitive than the rN-based IgM ELISA for SARS-CoV pneumonia [25]. Our results showed that the S-based IFA enabled specific detection of IgG or IgM to four individual HCoVs.",

Anti-S IgG antibodies to these four non-SARS-related HCoVs were detected at high rates (>70%) among healthy adults. Both anti-S IgG and IgM antibodies were found in the child group, and their prevalence increased with age up to 6 years, at which point it almost plateaued. These data suggest that exposure to HCoV is common in childhood and first infections by all four non-SARS HCoVs takes place during children. Moreover, we found evidence of anti-S IgG against double and multiple HCoVs in various combinations, which indicates that large proportions of the general population in Beijing may experience infections with more than one HCoV.",

            "text": "The seroprevalence of HCoV antibodies varies widely among studies, which used different antigens and methodologies [6,13-18,26-33]. Previous studies of non-SARS HCoVs demonstrated that seroprevalence varies greatly depending on the age of the population [6,13-18,26-33]. Our IFA study showed that the prevalence of the four anti-S IgG antibodies among this general Chinese population were slightly higher than those in another study from Germany using an Escherichia coli BL21-expressed recombinant N-based line immunoassay [13], which reported that the seropositivities in 25 healthy blood donors were 48% for HCoV-HKU1, 52% for -OC43, 56% for -229E, and 60% for -NL63. On the other hand, the seropositivity rate of three individual HCoVs excluding HCoV-HKU1 in this study was lower than that in another study of a US metropolitan adult population using baculovirus-expressed recombinant N-based ELISA [14], which showed seropositivity rates of 90.8% for HCoV-OC43, 91.3% for -229E, and 91.8% for -NL63, while that for -HKU1 was 59.2%. It was also supposed that the significantly different seropositivity rates for the various HCoVs might result in individuals with different demographic factors (e.g. ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic status) having different susceptibilities to individual HCoVs [14]. A recent study of 105 older adult veterans with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at seven US sites showed that serum IgG to HCoV-229E, -NL63, and -OC43 was detected in at least 98% of subjects, while antibodies to -HKU1 were identified in 96 subjects (91%) [17]. Thus EIA assays that use whole virus or N protein as the antigen, using which apparent cross-reactivity of HCoV antibodies has been demonstrated previously [18,24], may detect group- rather than type-specific antibody.",

We first investigated the prevalence of anti-S IgM to four individual HCoVs among a general population in Beijing using IFA. Anti-S IgM to individual HCoVs was detected in a portion of the asymptomatic child population. The anti-S IgM seropositivity appeared to increase with age up to 6 years and decline sharply after 14 years of age. However, no anti-S IgM to individual HCoVs was detected in the healthy adult population. These results suggest that primary seroconversion to these viruses occurs mainly during childhood and youth; In addition, HCoV infection might result in seroconversion in children with asymptomatic or subclinical manifestations. These results are also in agreement with HCoV molecular epidemiological surveys [12,34], which have indicated that primary exposure occurs mainly in childhood and youth.",

These four non-SARS-related HCoVs appear be circulating in the general population, and sustained HCoV infection becomes more likely with increasing age. This study may serve as a basis for the prevention and control of non-SARS-related HCoV infection. However, further research is needed to determine the false-positivity and -negativity rates associated with this anti-S IFA by determining antibody titres during the acute and convalescent phases after primary HCoV infection. Comparison of serological methods and antigen preparations as well as sample exchange will facilitate validation of the assays for individual HCoV antibody determination.",
