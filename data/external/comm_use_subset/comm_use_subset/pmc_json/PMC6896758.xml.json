            "text": "Diarrhoea in neonatal piglets is a common problem in many pig herds. Usually, this condition is seen either in the offspring of gilts or as an epidemic problem affecting litters from sows of any parity. In the first case, the problem is usually attributed to an inadequate acclimation protocol for gilts while in the latter, the most often cause is the introduction of a new enteric pathogen. These patterns reflect the immune status of sows against the causing agents and the transfer of colostral and lactogenic immunity to piglets. The agents involved in neonatal diarrhoea of piglets are diverse and include bacterial (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, etc.) and viral pathogens (coronaviruses, rotaviruses, etc.). Less commonly neonates can suffer from diarrhoea caused by parasites [1]. Most of the viruses causing outbreaks of diarrhoea in neonate piglets are RNA viruses such as Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) or Rotavirus A, B, C or H (RVA, RVB, RVC, RVH) [2\u20139]. Among them, Rotavirus A, B and C are a major cause of diarrhoea in pigs worldwide, having a significant impact in health and productivity, plus the potential of zoonotic transmission to humans [7]. The virus is transmitted by the faecal-oral route and large number of viral particles is excreted during Rotavirus infection. In contrast, other RNA viruses including Kobuvirus, Astrovirus, Sapovirus, Sapelovirus, Teschovirus, and Torovirus, have been detected in pig faeces but its role as causative agents of neonatal diarrhoea has not so far been fully elucidated [10\u201314]. For instance, porcine Kobuvirus (KobuV) has been found frequently (16\u201399%) in faecal samples of pigs worldwide [15]. In some cases, the presence of the virus was associated with diarrhoea, but in others no significant differences between infection rates in healthy or diarrhoeic animals was found. Frequently KobuV were present concomitantly with other viruses making difficult a precise assessment of its role as agent of disease [12, 16].",

Among the 9 diarrhoeic samples where a single virus was detected, RVA was present in 5 samples and KobuV was present in 4. Thirty-eight samples (81%) presented more than one virus and in one sample seven RNA viruses were identified: KobuV, RVC, AstV 3, 4 and 5, SAV and PEDV. Rotavirus (either RVA, RVB or RVC) plus KobuV was the combination present in 12 out of the 14 (86%) samples infected with 2 viruses.

Thus, when the number of reads for a given virus was compared to the total number of reads attributable to a mammalian RNA virus in the sample, it was evident that Rotaviruses, particularly RVA and RVB, clearly outnumbered any other virus that could be present (Fig. 1). In only nine cases, KobuV or SAV reads were predominant among viral reads (8 and 1 cases, respectively). In all 47 cases, one virus represented at least 45% of the total viral reads. Interestingly, when mixed rotavirus infections were detected (RVA-RVC or RVB-RVC), the proportion of one virus clearly predominated against the other. When coupled with the viral load, the relative frequencies per virus (Fig. 2) showed that for a majority of cases (40/47, 85.1%), the predominant virus in the sample represented read proportions higher than 0.5 and viral reads figures larger than 10E3. Nearly all of them (36/40, 90.0%) corresponded to Rotavirus \u2013 either RVA (21), RVB (6) or RVC (9) \u2013, with KobuV and SAV being much less frequent (3 and 1 cases, respectively).

The examination of the relative proportions of viral reads versus the number of reads showed that for any given case always one virus predominated, representing more than 45% of the mammalian viral reads obtained. This value can be tentatively proposed as a cut-off for the assignment of an etiological agent. In contrast, for all the other viruses examined, the relative abundance of their genomes would be more consistent with a subclinical infection. Whether this could be the consequence of a limited virulence, because of some level of passive immunity, or other causes, cannot be addressed in the present study.",

One interesting observation from the present study is that coinfections or RVA-RVC and RVB-RVC was very common, suggesting the need for simultaneous testing all three agents in cases of neonatal diarrhoea. Regarding KobuV, our results also agree with an increased prevalence of this agent observed in cases of diarrhoea in suckling piglets worldwide: Brazil [22], Korea [29] and Vietnam [30]; despite several studies have observed non-significant differences in KobuV infection between diarrheic and healthy piglets in several European countries [12, 16, 31]. As mentioned above, two different patterns were observed in cases where KobuV was present: one with high proportion of KobuV reads and high number of viral reads, and others where these two circumstances were not fulfilled. The first pattern could correspond to clinical cases caused by KobuV, while the second could correspond to secondary or concomitant infections by this agent. A similar pattern would apply to SAV. Regarding the other agents, since they were always in combination and their reads were not preeminent, its role must be seen as secondary at best. For instance, no differences in Astrovirus prevalence between diarrheic and non-diarrheic piglets were reported [32, 33], nor for Enterovirus prevalence between healthy and diarrheic pigs [30]. Interestingly, PEDV was seldom found in our samples and when found only traces could be detected. Prior to this, a higher frequency for this pathogen could be expected. However, while PEDV has caused recently severe epidemics in America [18], in Europe the incidence seems to be much lower [34]. Of note is the total absence of TGEV, a virus which was widespread in Europe, but has consistently declined, or even disappeared, after the apparition and fast spread worldwide in the nineties of Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus [35].",

While it is easy to understand that the introduction of a new enteric virus in the farm will result in its rapid spread and the eventual development of an epidemic, it is more difficult to understand how so many viruses can be present in the maternities without generating a herd immunity resulting in colostral and lactogenic protection of suckling piglets. One possibility is that, most often, maternal immunity could be enough to limit the replication of those agents but not to completely prevent the infection; namely only provided partial immunity. In other cases, on farms reporting disease even in sows, RVA was present. This is compatible with its assumed role as primary agent. We have recently described the introduction of a new RVA strain that rapidly spread across pig farms in Spain and that was also present in the samples of this study as well [36].",

            "text": "It is worth noting that the phylogenetic analyses for all the examined viruses indicated the existence of local clusters except for RVA (discussed above). This, together with the depth of the corresponding branches in the trees, suggested a long evolutionary history on a local basis. Certainly, we cannot discard the existence of other clusters for any of the reported viruses. However, the detection of several new genotypes for RVB and RVC plus the relative low nucleotide identity with other available sequences in GenBank reinforces the idea of local evolution at least for these two viruses. Moreover, with the results obtained we propose to define for RVB one new VP4 (P [6]) and two new VP7 (G27 and G28) genotypes; as well as genotypes G14 and G15 for RVC. The geographical pattern observed in the RVB phylogenetic trees agrees with the notion that RVB genotypes may be specific for host species and region [25]. Regarding KobuV, no differences in the clustering pattern were observed between those strains coming from cases in which KobuV was predominant or not. This suggests that phylogenetic clustering probably is not predictive of virulence for this virus and most probably, other causes (i.e. immunity) are more relevant with regards to the clinical expression of the disease. Similarly, for SAV no differences were seen, and all isolates clustered together within genogroup III, the most commonly reported porcine SAV [37].",

Although Kobuvirus was the most common virus detected, probably it was the primary agent of diarrhoea only in a small number of cases. Similarly, Sapovirus would be responsible of a single diarrhoea case. For the other examined viruses, the results indicated that many animals were infected in early life but the association with enteric disease was unclear. The NGS approach applied permit not only the detection RNA viruses present in a sample, but also to determine their relative abundances. This approach can be used for a more comprehensive diagnosis of neonatal diarrhoea and is useful for the examination of the RNA virome in faeces.",

Four samples from healthy non-diarrhoeic piglets were also included to be used as negative controls.

Only cases apparently unrelated (different farms with no evident connection) were included.

For the software programs used in steps iii), iv), vi) and vii) - FastQC\u00a9software, Kraken, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner and QUASR, respectively -, the default parameters of every program were applied. Next, a database for every RNA species identified was constructed by downloading the available complete genome sequences from GenBank. Finally, the sequences obtained were aligned and phylogenetically compared with the datasets constructed for every complete genome, or segment in the segmented genomes identified. The phylogenetic relationships among sequences were analysed using the software MEGA7 [43], by means of a Neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm, using the matrix of pairwise p-distances and 10,000 bootstrap replicates to estimate the confidence of the internal branches of the trees.",
