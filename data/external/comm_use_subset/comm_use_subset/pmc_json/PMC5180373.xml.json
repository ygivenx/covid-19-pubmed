Although 91 of the sequences were obtained from MERS-CoV in dromedaries, a large proportion of them were from a recent study in Saudi Arabia.13 The small number of dromedary MERS-CoV genomes obtained from other countries has hindered understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary history of the virus in camels outside of Saudi Arabia. In our previous report on MERS-CoV epidemiology in Dubai, nine dromedary MERS-CoV strains were sequenced and found to be closely related.14 Recently, we have reported another dromedary MERS-CoV strain detected in an isolated dromedary herd in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).15 Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis has indicated that this MERS-CoV strain is a unique member of a cluster of closely related MERS-CoV strains obtained from patients in the Hafr-Al-Batin region of Saudi Arabia and Qatar,16, 17 as well as those from patients in the recent Korean outbreak.18 From the results of these two studies, we hypothesized that diverse MERS-CoV strains may be circulating in dromedaries of the UAE. To test this hypothesis, we performed complete genome sequencing of 10 additional strains of MERS-CoV isolated from dromedaries in different regions of the UAE. The results support a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries and the co-circulation of diverse strains from multiple sources in the same farm. A novel clade A strain, the first identified in the UAE, may belong to a separate lineage, A2, circulating in dromedaries.",

Two hundred microliters of the filtrate was inoculated into 200 \u03bcL of Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Four hundred microliters of the mixture was added to 24-well tissue culture plates containing Vero cells for adsorption inoculation. After 1 h of adsorption, excess inoculum was discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the medium was replaced with 1 mL of Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco). The cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 and were inspected daily by inverted microscopy for cytopathic effect (CPE) for five days. Each of the cultures exhibited the typical CPE of detachment and rounding of cells. All cultures with a CPE were confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV through a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay targeting a region of the viral genome upstream of the envelope gene and isothermal amplification with a Genie instrument (Optigene Limited, Horsham, UK).",

Interestingly, the heptad repeat region has recently been reported to be a major selection target among MERS-CoVs, and different residues at position 1020 may affect the stability of the six-helix bundle formed by the heptad repeats.26 There were nine amino acid substitutions between clade A and B strains, and five amino acid substitutions between clade A1 and A2 strains.

For the eight MERS-CoV strains isolated from dromedaries from dairy farms in Dubai, one belongs to clade A (D988/15) and seven (D2597.2/14, D252/15, D374/15, D383/15, D389/15, D1157/15 and D1271/15) belong to clade B (Figure 2). Interestingly, the source clade A strain, D988/15, was isolated from a young female dromedary in a special dairy farm with camel mothers from Pakistan. Therefore, the source of this virus was most probably different from that of the seven clade B strains, which were isolated from dromedaries from a different dairy farm. The latter farm is a large closed system, which may explain the relative genetic closeness of the circulating MERS-CoV strains. Yet, the seven clade B isolates belonged to three distinct lineages, with five isolates (D2597.2/14, D252/15, D374/15, D383/15 and D389/15) clustered with several other MERS-CoV from Dubai.27 For the MERS-CoV isolated from a dromedary calf returning from Saudi Arabia (1164.1/14), the dromedary was from a herd of approximately 50 female breeding dromedaries in Dubai. Every year, these camels were brought to Saudi Arabia for 6 months because of the better grazing conditions due to the higher amount of rainfall in Saudi Arabia than in Dubai. The dromedary calves from this herd were born in Saudi Arabia. Young dromedaries are usually removed from the herd and start their training as racing camels when they are one year old. Although this MERS-CoV was most probably acquired in Saudi Arabia, its genome sequence is closely related to two human MERS-CoV strains from Oman (KT156560) and Abu Dhabi (KP209312), respectively (Figure 2). The MERS-CoV isolated from the dromedary in Umm Al Quwain (D1189.1/15) is closely related to D1271/15 in this study and to a human MERS-CoV strain isolated in Thailand (KT225476) (Figure 2). The present data showed that the genome sequences of the MERS-CoV strains isolated in the UAE were intermingled with other MERS-CoV strains found elsewhere in the Middle East or strains from patients who acquired their infections directly or indirectly in the Middle East. Moreover, diverse MERS-CoVs are co-circulating in dromedaries in the UAE, which derive from different sources.",

Such a polyphyletic origin of MERS-CoV in dromedaries is similar to the diverse lineages of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats,28, 29 but in contrast to the monophyletic origin of most human SARS-CoV strains, MERS-CoV strains from humans are polyphyletic as a result of multiple camel-to-human transmission events.30, 31 According to the existing evidence, a single interspecies transmission event probably occurred from bats to palm civets as the intermediate or amplification host, and then from palm civets to humans before the SARS epidemic in 2003.28, 32, 33 The rapid expansion of the epidemic arose after efficient human-to-human transmission of the human SARS-CoV strains. In contrast, MERS-CoV has become endemic in dromedaries of the UAE and other countries in the Middle East, with diverse strains being introduced into the human population. This finding is in line with the overall MERS-CoV phylogeny in the Middle East, with the tMRCA of all MERS-CoVs being dated back to around January 2011, thus suggesting that MER-CoV has emerged in humans relatively recently (Figures 2 and 6). The difference in evolutionary pathways between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also provides an explanation for why, MERS\u2014unlike SARS, which disappeared rapidly after civets were segregated from humans by closing wild animal markets in provinces in Southern China\u2014has persisted for more than three years and will probably continue to circulate in dromedaries and humans unless effective vaccines are available. Recently, viruses closely related to human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) have also been found in camels.34 However, in contrast to the polyphyletic origin of human and camel MERS-CoVs, the HCoV 229E and related dromedary-derived viruses were each monophyletic, thus suggesting that this endemic human coronavirus may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated viruses.",

Both phylogenetic and amino acid substitution analyses showed that the current clade A strains may consist of two distinct lineages: one from humans (A1) and one from camels (A2).

We have previously described recombination among the three human CoV HKU1 genotypes, and other human or animal coronaviruses,21, 37, 38 and other researchers have also found recombination in coronaviruses such as feline coronavirus type II and infectious bronchitis virus.39 A number of studies have also reported recombination among MERS-CoVs from different countries.13, 40 However, we should be cautious when interpreting possible recombination events solely on the basis of phylogenetic analysis to avoid drawing premature conclusions. For example, by phylogenetic tree analysis, strains D1271/15 and D1189.1/15 in the present study and strain D2731.3/14, which we have reported previously,15 showed inconsistent phylogenetic clustering in trees based on different viral genes (Figure 3). However, bootscan analysis and multiple alignments did not reveal evidence of recombination for strain D2731.3/14 (Figure 4B). Only strains D1271/15 (from Dubai) and D1189.1/15 (from Umm Al Quwain) showed evidence of a likely recombination event after stepwise examination using phylogenetic analysis, bootscan analysis and multiple sequence alignments (Figure 4a). It is also important to note that the nucleotide sequences of all MERS-CoV genomes are >99% identical. Therefore, even for the strains with possible recombination, there are only approximately 10 base pair differences upstream and downstream of the potential recombination site between the \u2018recombinant' and \u2018parent' strains. Although these sequence differences may have arisen through recombination, they may also have resulted from individual nucleotide mutations. Further studies with careful interpretation of recombination analysis results will be important to understand the role of recombination in the emergence and evolution of MERS-CoV.",
