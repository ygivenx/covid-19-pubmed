NA has receptor-destroying activity by cleaving SIAs from sialoglycans. The HA and NA protein functionalities are critical for host tropism, and need to be well balanced in relation to the host receptor repertoire for optimal in vivo viral fitness [1\u20133]. However, there is no standard assay and unit for measuring a functional balance and the precise mode by which HA- and NA-receptor interactions contribute to the balance at the molecular level remains mostly unexplored. An optimal HA-NA balance is hypothesized to allow virions to penetrate the heavily sialylated mucus layer, to attach to host cells prior to virus entry, and to be released from cells after assembly [4\u20137].",

The human receptor repertoire differs from avians and requires adaptations in the SIA-interacting HA and NA proteins for optimal interaction. The HA protein of avian IAVs prefers binding to terminally located SIAs linked to the penultimate galactose via an \u03b12,3-linkage. Human IAVs preferentially bind to \u03b12,6-linked sialosides [8\u201311]. Internal sugars and their linkages as well as glycan branching have been shown to determine fine specificity of HA-receptor binding [12\u201317]. Changes in the receptor-binding properties of the HA proteins are achieved by mutations in the receptor binding site, which have been well documented for several HA subtypes [1, 10, 11, 18]. Much less is known about the adaptations in NA required to match the corresponding HA proteins.",

            "text": "Adjacent to the catalytic site, NA contains a 2nd SIA-binding site (2SBS; also referred to as hemadsorption site) (S1 Fig)[28\u201331]. The 2SBS is made up by three loops, which contain residues that interact with SIA. Mutations in these loops in N1, N2 and N9 affected NA binding of erythrocytes [28, 32\u201335] or sialosides [26, 33] and enzymatic cleavage of multivalent substrates [28, 33] but not of monovalent substrates [26, 28, 33]. A detailed analysis of the receptor binding properties of the 2SBS of most NAs is lacking. N1 and N2 proteins bind to \u03b12,3- as well as \u03b12,6-linked SIAs based on binding of resialylated erythrocytes [28, 35] whereas N1 and N9 proteins mainly bind, via their 2SBS, to \u03b12,3-linked sialosides present on glycan arrays [33] or in biolayer interferometry assays [26]. Interestingly, the high conservation of SIA-contact residues in the 2SBS of avian IAV is lost in N1 and N2 of human IAVs [1, 26, 28, 30] that, supposedly, all lack a functional 2SBS. For N2 of avian viruses, the conservation of the 2SBS is only lost in viruses of the H9N2 subtype, which mainly infect Galliformes species, in contrast to other N2-containing viruses, which mainly infect Non-Galliformes species [36] (S2 Fig). Conservation of the SIA-contact residues in the 2SBS of N2 is also lost in canine and not restored in swine viruses, the latter of which are generally derived from human viruses (S2 Fig). It is tempting to hypothesize that the loss of a functional 2SBS in pandemic viruses is part of a required adaptation of the HA-NA balance in order to deal with the altered receptor repertoire in the novel human host [1, 28]. At first, to test this hypothesis, a detailed analysis of the contribution of (mutations in) the 2SBS to receptor binding and cleavage in the context of IAV particles is necessary as the interplay with HA proteins binding to either avian- or human-type receptors needs to be taken into account.",

We have recently established novel kinetic assays based on biolayer interferometry (BLI) with which, in the context of virus particles, HA binding, NA cleavage and their balance can be monitored in real time using synthetic glycans and sialylated glycoproteins [37]. Multivalent IAV-receptor binding is established by multiple low affinity interactions of several HA trimers and sialosides [38, 39]. This enables a dynamic binding mode in which individual interactions are rapidly formed and broken without causing dissociation of the virus but providing access of NA to temporarily free SIAs. Cleavage by NA results in reduced SIA-receptor density, in virus movement and ultimately in virion dissociation [37]. How fast this occurs depends on the HA-NA-receptor balance governing the dynamics of virus-glycan interactions.",

We first performed a detailed analysis of the functional importance of the 2SBS in N2 for substrate binding and cleavage by comparing NA of the pandemic H2N2 virus from 1957, containing a mutated 2nd SIA-binding site, with an avian-like NA, in which the 2nd SIA binding site was restored. Preferred binding to \u03b12,3-linked sialosides was shown to result in enhanced cleavage of substrates containing these glycans. Analysis of the HA-NA-receptor balance of viruses containing these N2 proteins in combination with H3 proteins that prefer binding to avian or human-type receptors clearly demonstrated a role for the 2SBS in the complex and dynamic interplay between HA, NA and receptor, which has been largely overlooked until now. The functional importance of the 2SBS for the HA-NA-receptor balance may explain the conservation and loss of this site in avian and human IAVs, respectively.",

            "text": "We first analysed the receptor binding and cleavage activity of N2 NA with and without a functional 2SBS using purified recombinant soluble NA expressed in HEK293T cells [20]. In NA of A/Singapore/1/1957 (H2N2) pandemic virus (referred to as human N2 [hN2]) one of the SIA-contact residues in the 2SBS is mutated compared to the avian consensus sequence (S367N, S3 Fig). Introduction of the reciprocal mutation (N367S) in this NA restored the 2SBS (referred to as avian-like N2 [aN2]) [28]. hN2 and aN2 displayed similar specific activities when using the monovalent MUNANA [2\u2019-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-\u03b1-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid] substrate (Fig 1A, S4A and S4B Fig), indicating that mutation of the 2SBS did not affect the catalytic activity of the N2 proteins per se. Similar results were obtained previously using membrane-associated proteins [28], indicating that the activity of the recombinant soluble proteins accurately reflects the activity of their membrane-bound counterparts as concluded earlier for N1 [20]. Cleavage of SIAs from fetuin and transferrin sialoglycoproteins was quantified by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), by analysing the increase or decrease in binding of lectins depending on their binding specificities (S4 Fig). ECA (Erythrina Cristagalli lectin) specifically binds glycans containing terminal Gal\u03b11,4GlcNAc corresponding to non-sialylated N-linked sugars [40], while PNA (peanut agglutinin) binds to terminal Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc, which generally corresponds to non-sialyated O-linked sugars [41]. NA activity thus results in increased binding of these lectins. MAL I (Maackia Amurensis Lectin I) and SNA (Sambucus Nigra Lectin) specifically bind \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,6-linked SIAs, respectively [42, 43]. Binding of SNA and MAL I is decreased by NA activity. For all lectins analysed, aN2 was more active than hN2 using fetuin, containing \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked SIAs (Fig 1A) [44]. In contrast, no statistically significant difference was observed using transferrin that only contains \u03b12,6-linked sialoglycans (Fig 1A) [45, 46]. Plotting the specific activities of the NA proteins relative to their specific activities as determined by the fetuin-ECA combination resulted in similar activity profiles (Fig 1B), which mimic those determined previously for N1 and N9 [26, 33]. Both hN2 and aN2 preferred cleavage of \u03b12,3- (determined with fetuin-MAL I) over \u03b12,6-(determined with fetuin-SNA) linked SIAs (Fig 1B). In agreement herewith, the specific activities were higher when determined with the fetuin-ECA than with the transferrin-ECA combination as fetuin, but not transferrin, contains \u03b12,3-linked SIAs (Fig 1B).",

We next used BLI to study the kinetics of NA activity on a multivalent surface coated with either an avian receptor (3\u2019SLNLN: NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) or a human receptor (6\u2019SLNLN: NeuAc\u03b12-6Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc). NA activity can be directly monitored in real-time by the specific binding of the lectin ECA to terminal Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc glycotopes that become available upon removal of SIA by NA (Fig 1C and 1D, red and black lines). Note that cleavage of the small SIA moiety is not detected directly by BLI (Fig 1C and 1D, dashed red and black lines). Binding of ECA to a sensor coated with LNLN (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc, Fig 1C and 1D blue lines) rapidly reaches the maximum ECA binding signal (representing 100% de-sialylation) assuring that ECA binding during the relatively slow accumulation of de-sialylated glycans by NA activity (red and black lines) reflects the cleavage kinetics of the N2 proteins. Both hN2 and aN2 more efficiently cleaved 3\u2019SLNLN over 6\u2019SLNLN. Especially the aN2 protein displayed much more efficient cleavage of 3\u2019SLNLN. We conclude that restoration of the 2SBS in hN2 to the avian consensus sequence results in enhanced cleavage of substrates containing \u03b12,3-linked SIAs.",

We observed hemagglutination for recombinant soluble aN2 but not for hN2 (S5A Fig). However, no specific binding to synthetic \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked sialoglycans by BLI could be observed for the recombinant soluble N2 proteins, which could be due to low affinity of the 2SBS. By embedding the N2 proteins in membrane vesicles highly multivalent receptor interactions may increase receptor-binding avidity. To this end, full length N2 proteins were expressed in 293T cells. N2 virus-like particles (VLPs) [47] were directly harvested from the culture supernatant, while cells were treated with hypotonic and hypertonic buffers, resulting in the release of N2 protein-containing vesicles [48]. Preparations containing similar amounts of N2, based on MUNANA activity (Fig 1A) were used to determine the receptor specificity of the 2SBS by BLI [26]. Negligible binding was obtained for hN2 VLPs (Fig 2A and 2B) or vesicles (S5D and S5E Fig) to \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,6-linked SIAs, regardless of the presence of the NA inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), which binds the NA catalytic site. In contrast, highly 3\u2019SLNLN-specific, binding was observed for aN2 VLPs and vesicles (Fig 2A and 2B; S5D and S5E Fig) in the presence of OC leading to the conclusion that aN2 has much higher lectin activity than hN2 due to the presence of a functional 2SBS. The observed \u03b12,3-linked SIA specificity is in agreement with the particularly enhanced cleavage of substrates containing \u03b12,3-linked SIAs (Fig 1). No binding of aN2 VLPs to 3\u2019SLNLN was observed in the absence of OC, which is likely explained by immediate self-elution of VLPs carrying active NA proteins.",

The hH3hN2 virus, lacking a functional 2SBS, produced large and clear plaques on Vero cells (Fig 3A and 3B, S6A and S6B Fig) as compared to the smaller, fuzzy plaques of the hH3aN2 virus with a functional 2SBS. Staining of plaques at 48 h post infection indicated that all cells within the plaques of hH3hN2 virus were infected, whereas many non-infected cells could be observed in the hH3aN2 plaques. This could be due to the more active aN2, which may destroy receptors on cells before the virus can enter into the cells. hH3aN2 reached lower titres than the hH3hN2 virus at 24 and 48 h post infection when Vero cells were used (Fig 3C), while no significant differences were observed for replication in MDCK cells (Fig 3D). Differences in cell surface sialosides and their distribution may explain differences between replication in Vero and MDCK cells. Although the sialylation patterns of MDCK and Vero cells are poorly characterized, both cell lines can be infected with human and avian IAVs and express \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked SIAs [49\u201351]. From these results we conclude that the absence or presence of a functional 2SBS in N2 may affect virus replication kinetics in a cell type-dependent manner.",

As a result the hH3aN2 virus displayed a higher initial binding-rate ratio 3\u2019SLNLN/6\u2019SLNLN than hH3hN2 (Fig 4C, red and black bars). Next, two recombinant soluble glycoproteins containing mainly N-linked glycans (lysosomal-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 [LAMP1], ca. 18 N- and 6 O-linked glycans [52, 53]), or O-linked glycans (glycophorin A, ca. 16 O- and a single N-linked glycan [54, 55]) were used in BLI as recently described for recombinant fetuin [37]. LAMP1 and glycophorin A mimic the presumed functional and decoy receptors found on cells (LAMP1) and on mucins (glycophorin A) that are rich in N- or O-glycans, respectively. Analysis of the glycans on these glycoproteins by lectin binding using BLI confirmed the presence of sialylated N-linked glycans (both \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked) on both proteins, while only glycophorin A was shown to contain sialylated O-glycans (S7 Fig). Again, a functional 2SBS (present in aN2) contributed to virus binding (Fig 4D and 4E). This contribution was larger for binding to glycophorin A than to LAMP1 as judged from the initial binding rates (Fig 4F).",

The results above implicate that, besides adaptations in HA, also adaptations in the 2SBS may contribute to a specificity-switch when an avian IAV adapts to humans. We therefore studied the effect of the 2SBS in NA when combined with an avian-type HA preferring binding to \u03b12,3-linked SIAs. We generated the corresponding recombinant A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3N2) viruses containing 7 amino acid substitutions in the HA (see S8A Fig). These substitutions reverted the HA back to the avian consensus sequence (referred to as avian-like aH3), including the crucial substitutions Q226L and G228S, which enable HA preferential binding to avian-type receptors [56, 57]. The resulting viruses are referred to as aH3hN2 and aH3aN2, depending on the absence and presence of the functional 2SBS, respectively. We confirmed the receptor-binding specificities of soluble hH3 and aH3 proteins by solid phase fetuin- and transferrin-binding assays and BLI (S8B and S8C Fig). As expected, aH3 displayed higher binding levels to fetuin, containing \u03b12,3- and \u03b12,6-linked SIAs, than hH3, while hH3 bound better than aH3 to transferrin, which only contains \u03b12,6-linked sialoglycans. BLI analysis using H3-containing vesicles obtained from cells expressing full-length versions of hH3 or aH3 confirmed the different receptor-binding properties of these H3 proteins to 3\u2019SLNLN and 6\u2019SLNLN (S8D and S8E Fig). In contrast to viruses containing hH3, the presence of a functional 2SBS in aN2 enhanced replication of viruses with aH3 both on Vero (Fig 3E) and MDCK (Fig 3F) cells. Differences in virus replication were smaller for MDCK than for Vero cells. We next analysed receptor-binding properties of aH3hN2 and aH3aN2 viruses using BLI. As observed before for the hH3-containing viruses (Fig 4C; red and black bars), a functional 2SBS enhanced binding to 3\u2019SLNLN but not 6\u2019SLNLN when N2 was combined with aH3 (Fig 4C). However, viruses containing aH3 displayed similar binding kinetics in the presence of OC regardless of the presence of a functional 2SBS for both LAMP1 and glycophorin A (Fig 4G, 4H and 4I). From these results we conclude that a functional 2SBS site in NA contributes to virion-receptor binding in a HA- and receptor-dependent manner.",

The viruses differed, however, in their specific activities when the multivalent glycoprotein fetuin was used as substrate in an ELLA (Fig 5B). hH3hN2 virus was less active compared to viruses containing aN2 and/or aH3, indicating a contribution of receptor binding via HA and the 2SBS to NA enzymatic activity in the context of virus particles.

These endpoint assays do not, however, elucidate the HA-NA balance of these viruses, for which kinetic BLI assays are required [37]. Preliminary experiments showed inefficient cleavage of the synthetic glycans by the recombinant viruses. Kinetic assays to determine the HA-NA balance of these viruses were therefore performed with the glycoprotein receptors (LAMP1 or glycophorin A). In the absence of OC, that is, with active NA proteins, no appreciable binding of hH3-containing viruses could be detected indicating efficient receptor cleavage by NA (Fig 5C and 5D). Limited binding could be detected, however, for the aH3-containing viruses in the absence of OC. The binding curve of the virus with a functional 2SBS (aH3aN2) bended earlier and had a smaller area under the curve than that of the virus without a functional 2SBS (aH3hN2) for both LAMP1 and glycophorin A. This bending of the curves is explained by ongoing cleavage of SIAs by viruses attached to the sensor-attached glycoproteins, resulting in release of bound virus particles [37]. The earlier bending and smaller area under the curve observed for the aH3aN2 virus is indicative of more efficient cleavage of the sensor-attached receptors by this virus than by aH3hN2, lacking a functional 2SBS.",

            "text": "The effect of receptor binding via NA and HA on NA activity of virions was analysed further by NA-dependent virion self-elution from a receptor-coated BLI sensor after prior binding of the virions in the presence of OC. Self-elution of IAV particles requires NA activity and self-elution is not observed when NA activity is blocked by OC [37]. After binding of the four recombinant viruses to LAMP1 and glycophorin A in the presence of OC, OC was removed by repeated short washes in Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with Calcium and Magnesium and virus self-elution was monitored. Clearly, viruses with aN2 proteins eluted faster from the sensors than the viruses with hN2 (compare hN3aN2 with hN3hN2 and aH3aN2 with aH3hN2; Fig 5E and 5F), for both glycoprotein receptors. Of note, NA-depended self-elution of virus particles is often preceded by an apparent increase in virus binding [37] represented here as negative self-elution, particularly in the case of aH3aN2 and aH3hN2 (Fig 5F). The larger negative area of self-elution for aH3hN2 reflects the reduced NA activity of this virus compared to aH3aN2. Also the identity of HA affected the virus self-elution rate. Viruses with hH3 eluted faster than corresponding viruses with aH3 (e.g. compare hH3aN2 with aH3aN2). For hH3aN2, self-elution was faster from glycophorin A than from LAMP1. For aH3-containing viruses, the opposite was observed. Differences in virion self-elution observed for different HA-receptor combinations could be due the different receptor repertoires present on the two proteins (S7 Fig). The results indicate that receptor binding via the 2SBS of NA contributes to enzymatic cleavage by NA in virions and to virion self-elution from a receptor-coated surface. Virion self-elution was also shown to depend on the identity of the HA and the glycoprotein receptor used.",

Most viruses isolated thereafter did not contain the S367N mutations but rather contained the S370L mutation, which also results in loss of a SIA-contact residue in the 370 loop (S3 Fig) and hemadsorption activity [28]. Both single mutations had a similar negative effect on catalytic activity of the 1957 NA [28]. These results indicate that there was not a selection against S367 per se, but rather against a functional 2SBS, which is achieved by either mutation. However, several additional mutations accumulated in time in the three loops of the 2SBS. N2 from the A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) (referred to as HK N2) contains five mutations (S370L, N400S, N401D, W403R, P432K) in the 2SBS compared to the avian consensus sequence (Fig 6A). To analyse the contribution of the 2SBS to the enzymatic activity of these different N2 proteins, a comparative analysis of recombinant proteins and viruses using monovalent and multivalent substrates was performed. The HK N2 protein was 4\u20135 fold less active than hN2 both on the monovalent substrate MUNANA and the multivalent substrate fetuin. Cleavage of sialoglycans attached to transferrin was not significantly affected (Fig 6B). We also compared the NA activity of recombinant H3N2 viruses only differing in their NA segment. HK H3N2 virus, containing the 1968 HK N2 protein, displayed 2-fold lower NA activity per virus particle than the hH3hN2 virus, containing the 1957 N2 protein, as determined by MUNANA cleavage (Fig 6C). Similarly, the time required for 50% self-elution of virions from the multivalent receptor LAMP1, was 2-fold longer for HK H3N2 than for hH3hN2 (Fig 6D). Thus, hN2 from 1957 and 1968 HK N2 differ to a similar extent in their catalytic activity both when monovalent or multivalent substrates are used. As receptor-binding via the 2SBS only increases NA activity for multivalent, but not monovalent substrates, we conclude that these differences do not result from differences in receptor-binding by their (non-functional) 2SBS. Moreover, the difference observed when comparing the two recombinant proteins is similar to the difference in activity of the two NAs in the virus context.",

We now show that the 2SBS is an important factor in the complex interplay between HA, NA and receptors, referred to as the HA-NA-receptor balance. A functional 2SBS in N2 was shown to prefer binding to \u03b12,3-linked sialosides similarly to N1 [26] and N9 [33]. In agreement herewith, it enhances catalytic activity against substrates carrying \u03b12,3-linked SIAs. The contribution of the 2SBS to the HA-NA-receptor balance of virus particles was shown to be receptor- and HA protein-dependent as demonstrated by kinetic analysis of receptor-binding and -cleavage of virions using BLI. The 2SBS was shown to contribute to receptor binding also when NA was combined with a receptor-binding HA in IAV virions, as well as to cleavage of receptors by virions and to virion self-elution from a receptor-coated surface. The absence or presence of a functional 2SBS also affected virus replication in a cell type- and HA-dependent manner. Our results indicate that mutation of the 2SBS as observed in early human pandemic viruses negatively affects the catalytic activity of NA and may serve to restore the HA-NA-receptor balance of viruses carrying HA proteins with altered receptor-binding properties in relation to a novel host sialome. Conservation of the 2SBS in most avian strains, with the notable exception of H9N2 viruses, is lost in human [26, 29, 30, 34], swine and canine variants (S2 Fig). Strong conservation usually reflects a critical function. It would be very interesting to investigate in depth whether a critical function for the 2SBS in avian strains, for instance related to the HA-NA-receptor balance, is not required for efficient replication and transmission of human, canine and swine strains.",

The specificity of the N2 2SBS correlates with the enhanced cleavage of substrates carrying \u03b12,3-linked SIAs compared to substrates carrying only \u03b12,6-linked sialosides. Of note, enhanced activity was also observed for \u03b12,6-linked SIAs at least when these sialosides were linked to substrates additionally carrying \u03b12,3-linked SIAs (Fig 1A; fetuin-SNA combination). These results indicate that the 2SBS enhances catalytic activity by bringing sialosides on multivalent substrates close to the catalytic site and that, depending on the substrate used, the enhanced cleavage of SIAs not necessarily matches the specificity of the 2SBS. Preferred binding of avian-type receptors via its 2SBS was previously also observed for N9 [33] and N1 [26], suggesting that this is a conserved feature for NAs of different subtypes. We cannot exclude, however, that the 2SBS of different NA subtypes may differ in their receptor-binding fine specificity, as structural differences were observed in the interactions between ligands and the 2SBS for different NA subtypes [30]. In N9, the conserved K432 residue in the 2SBS forms a hydrogen bond with SIA [29] and mutation K432E in N1 has a large negative effect on the cleavage of multivalent substrates [26]. In contrast, several other avian NA subtypes, including N2, contain a Q or E residue at this position, which does not form a hydrogen bond with SIA in the few available crystal structures [30]. Previously, it was shown that N1 and N2 NAs bound with similar efficiency to both avian and human type receptors SIAs [28, 35]. This discrepancy is probably explained by the different methods used to analyse the receptor specificity of the 2SBS. In the previous reports, a red blood cell binding assay was employed, in which desialylation of erythrocytes was followed by resialylation using \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,6-sialyltransferases. Binding to resialylated erythrocytes might be affected by prior incomplete desialylation. Alternatively, a higher receptor density on erythrocytes compared to the BLI sensor surface might allow for binding of \u03b12,6-linked SIAs. The ability of the 2SBS to bind human-type receptors to some extent is also suggested by the modestly increased or decreased cleavage of SIAs from substrates only containing \u03b12,6-linked SIAs upon the introduction of mutations in the 2SBS (this study and [26, 28]).",

In combination with HA preferring binding to \u03b12,6-linked SIAs (hH3), the 2SBS enhanced binding for all receptors analysed, except 6\u2019SLNLN, to which the recombinant aN2 protein did not bind. Binding to glycophorin A, carrying many O-linked sugars also found on mucins, was more enhanced by the 2SBS than binding to LAMP1, which carries mostly sialylated N-glycans. The functional significance of this difference remains to be determined. When combined with HA that prefers binding to \u03b12,3-sialosides (aH3), the enhancing effect of the 2SBS was not observed for the glycoprotein receptors analysed. Thus, the contribution of NA to virion-receptor binding depends on the specificity/affinity of the corresponding HA and the receptors present. Previously it was shown that the active site of NA contributes to virion-receptor binding in case of a low-activity catalytic site [37], a characteristic which is also appears to be displayed by recent H3N2 viruses [60, 61]. As we now show that a functional 2SBS in NA can also contribute to virion-receptor binding, two mechanisms exist by which NA can assist in binding of virions to host cells.",

This HA-NA-receptor balance can be experimentally determined using kinetic BLI assays by analysis of virus binding in the absence or presence of NA inhibitors and self-elution from different receptors (this paper and [37]). The HA-NA-receptor balance determines the residence time of a virus on a sialylated surface and the speed by which it moves over this surface. We assume that an optimal balance is important for virions to efficiently pass the heavily sialylated mucus layer, while still allowing virion attachment to host cells resulting in endocytic uptake. The complexity of the HA-NA-receptor balance is exemplified by the contribution of NA to receptor binding [37] and of HA to the apparent catalytic activity of NA (this paper)[37, 62]. We now show that the HA-NA-receptor balance as reflected for example in virion self-elution (Fig 5) is affected by a functional 2SBS, depending on the particular HA with which NA is combined and the receptors used. Changes in the 2SBS of NA should thus be considered in the context of mutations affecting the receptor-binding site of HA and the catalytic site of NA.",

The accumulation of several mutations in the 2SBS was found to have no further negative effects on the enzyme-enhancing function of 2SBS as compared to a single mutation of a SIA contact residues in the 2SBS of an early pandemic virus from 1957. Although we cannot exclude that the accumulation of mutations in the 2SBS of N2 indicates ongoing adaptation of NA to the human host or serves to restore subtle deviations in the HA-NA-receptor balance resulting from other mutations in HA and/or NA, it seems more likely that it rather results from continuous immune pressure on this site [22, 63] in combination with loss of functional importance of the 2SBS in human viruses.",

Of note, we now show that the presence or absence of a functional 2SBS affected virus replication depending on the receptor-binding properties of HA, with which NA was combined. Replication of viruses with a human or avian-like HA is enhanced by the absence or presence of a functional 2SBS, respectively, although some cell-dependent differences were observed. The absence or presence of a functional 2SBS was reported not to affect influenza viral replication in ducks [34]. However, in this latter study recombinant viruses were used containing HA from a H2N9 and NA from a H3N2 virus. This may have resulted in a mismatched HA-NA combination in which the presence of the 2SBS might be of minor influence on replication. Alternatively, the 2SBS may be important for virus transmission rather than for replication in ducks per se. Clearly, additional experiments are needed to demonstrate the importance of the 2SBS for IAV replication and transmission in vivo. Interestingly, both for H9N2 and H7N9 viruses, the well-known Q226L mutation in the receptor-binding site of HA, resulting in a shift from avian to human receptor specificity, is associated with mutations in the 2SBS that negatively affect receptor binding [33, 36]. These avian viruses thus display a striking parallel with the changes observed in the receptor-binding sites of HA and NA of avian-origin pandemic viruses. We propose that mutations in the 2SBS of avian viruses may be indicative of an as of yet underappreciated, increased potential of avian viruses to cross the host species barrier. Of note, also upon introduction of coronavirus OC43 into humans, the lectin function of the receptor-destroying hemagglutin-esterase protein was lost through progressive accumulation of mutations resulting in reduced cleavage of multivalent substrates [64]. Thus, both coronaviruses and IAVs appear to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract by tuning the virion receptor-binding and cleavage functions, the latter among others by mutation of the lectin domain of the receptor-destroying NA.",

Purified NA proteins were quantified by quantitative densitometry of GelCode Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific)-stained protein gels additionally containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards.

Virus stocks were grown in MDCK-II cells (ECACC). Viruses were inactivated by UV radiation using UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) on 50,000 \u03bcJoules prior to their use in the binding and cleavage assays.

Enzymatic activity of the NA proteins towards multivalent glycoprotein substrates was analysed using a previously described enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) [33]. In brief, fetuin- or transferrin-coated plates were incubated with serial dilutions of recombinant soluble NA proteins. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, plates were washed and incubated with either biotinylated Erythrina Cristagalli Lectin (ECA, 1.25 \u03bcg/ml; Vector Laboratories), biotinylated peanut agglutinin (PNA, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml; Galab Technologied), biolinylated Sambucus Nigra Lectin (SNA, 1.25 \u03bcg/ml; Vector Laboratories) or biotinylated Maackia Amurensis Lectin I (MAL I, 2.5 \u03bcg/ml; Vector Laboratories). Cleavage of SIAs from fetuin and transferrin was quantified by analysing the increase (PNA and ECA) or decrease (MAL I and SNA) in binding of different lectins depending on their binding specificities (S4 Fig). The binding of ECA, PNA, SNA and MAL I was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB, bioFX) in an ELISA reader EL-808 (BioTEK) by measuring the optical density (OD) at 450 nm. The data were fitted by non-linear regression using the Prism 6.05 software (GraphPad). The resulting curves were used to determine the amount of NA protein corresponding to half maximum MUNANA cleavage or lectin binding. The inverse of this amount is a measure of specific activity (activity per amount of protein) and was graphed relative to other NA proteins or substrate-lectin combinations.",

(C and D) Identical number of hH3hN2 and hH3aN2, and aH3hN2 and aH3aN2 virus particles were analysed for their ability to bind LAMP1 (C) or glycophorin A (D) in the absence of OC using BLI. (E and F) After binding of virus preparations with identical particle numbers to LAMP1 (E) or glycophorin A (F) in the presence of OC (similarly as shown in Fig 4), OC was removed by three repeated washes and virion self-elution in the absence of OC was monitored. Dissociation of virus particles was normalized to the virus association levels in the presence of OC. Experiments were performed three times. Representative experiments are shown.",
