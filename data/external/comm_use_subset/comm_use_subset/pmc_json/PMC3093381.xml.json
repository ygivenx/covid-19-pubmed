Rabies virus and other lyssaviruses infect bats of many species, and Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are reservoirs for both Hendra and Nipah viruses [4], [5], [6]. Two newly discovered human reoviruses, Melaka virus and Kampar virus, associated with influenza-like illnesses in humans, may be transmitted from small flying foxes (fruit bats; Pteropus hypomelanus) based on the close phylogenetic relationships of these viruses to Pulau virus, a bat reovirus [7], [8]. Egyptian fruit bats (Rousetttus aegyptiacus) are known reservoirs of Marburg and certain ebolaviruses [9], [10].",

Among the 5 known human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses (formerly called group 1 CoVs), HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are betacoronaviruses (formerly group 2a), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-like CoVs are also betacoronaviruses (formerly group 2b). The SARS pandemic of 2002\u201303 was caused by SARS-CoV, a zoonotic coronavirus recently emerged from horseshoe bats (suborder Microchiroptera, family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) from different locations in southeastern China [11], [12]. Extensive worldwide surveillance of bats showed that bats carry an enormous diversity of CoVs [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences of coronaviruses from bats, humans, birds, and other vertebrates suggests that bats may be the reservoir hosts from which all coronavirus lineages originated [23], [24].",

Bats were identified to species based on external morphological characteristics as described in regional faunal manuals [26], [27] adopting revised taxonomy for Myotis occultus\n[28] and Parastrellus hesperus\n[29]. To determine whether CoVs persist in bat populations over the course of several years, additional bat fecal samples were collected during the summers of 2008 and 2009 at two rural sites in north central and southeastern Colorado. In addition, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were sampled at 5 different sites (sites #17\u201321) within a single urban municipality in Northern Colorado (Fort Collins) during the summers of 2007 and 2008. These sites were chosen because they were in close proximity to humans [30]. Site #17 was in a vintage farmhouse that is currently being used as a family visitation center; site #18 was a natural creek surrounded by suburban neighborhoods; site #19 was in the recreation center of a church; site #20 was within an education building, and site #21 was within a picnic pavilion at a public park. Several of these sites had been previously used in rabies ecology studies, and some bats had been tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) for host demographic analysis [31], [32]. This allowed for repeated capture and sampling of known individual bats.",

Our data indicate that nucleotide sequences of alphacoronaviruses harbored by Colorado bats are distinct from those found in Old World bats. Two recent studies of the bat guano virome using next generation sequence technology also only detected alphacoronaviruses in the New World bats of the species tested, as well as a diverse array of other types of viruses [41], [42].

We found similar results in New World bats. At site #4 long-legged bats had an alphacoronavirus RNA prevalence of 31% in 2007, 19% in 2009, but only 6% in 2008. In all five of the urban maternity roosts sampled, CoVs persisted in bat roosts throughout the course of the non-hibernating part of the year (spring/summer) and persisted from year to year. We also found that the prevalence of CoV infection in these bat roosts tended to peak in late spring/early summer. The prevalence of infection with human CoVs also shows significant annual variations [45], possibly depending on environmental conditions and/or fluctuating CoV antibody levels in the population. Possible seasonal variation in CoV infection rates may explain why in our initial 2006 study we found a high prevalence (50%) of alphacoronavirus RNA in occult bats [17], but in 2007 we did not detect any positive individuals (22 tested in the same region).",

            "text": "Phylogenetic studies of CoV genomes in Old World bats in Asia and Europe have suggested that some bat CoVs may infect bats of only one species or several closely related species. In Asia and Germany, different species of bats roosting in the same cave were found to host different CoVs, whereas bats of the same species in different locations harbored similar CoVs [14], [19]. In Europe, strict associations were found between bat CoV deduced amino acid sequences in an 816 bp fragment of the RdRp gene and their specific bat hosts [40]. In Africa, CoVs found in one species of bat were not detected in bats of different species co-roosting in the same cave [38]. Similarly, our study showed that New World bats of the same species in geographically distinct locations and over the course of several years harbor similar CoVs. In contrast to these findings, in Kenya some CoVs appear to be able to infect Old World bats of several different species [21]. Our preliminary nucleotide sequence data also suggests that we found very closely related CoV nucleotide sequences in New World bats from three different species of Myotis (M. volans, M. evotis, and M. occultus). Furthermore, in site #4, we found similar nucleotide sequences in the spike and replicase genes in CoV RNAs from both a big-brown bat and a long-legged bat, suggesting that at least some New World bat CoVs may be able to infect bats of different genera. These findings are notable, as recent phylogenetic studies of rabies viruses in bats suggest that host species barriers play a key role in cross species transmission of viruses [46].",

Big brown bats are common inhabitants of buildings in cities and towns in Colorado and across the United States, and are the primary species encountered by humans in terms of potential exposure to disease agents [30], [33], [47] These bats had a high prevalence of CoV infection, ranging from 0\u201367% (overall 10%) depending on the site and time of year. Big brown bats submitted to the CDPHE for rabies testing because of known direct contact with humans also had a very high prevalence (19%) of CoV infection. Because bats which have known or potential contact with humans have such a high prevalence of CoV infection, opportunities exist for potential transmission of these viruses to humans.",

CoVs can undergo a high frequency of RNA recombination, both in vitro and in vivo, which may play an important role in their evolution and virulence [48]. Old World bat CoVs of several different genotypes were found to co-exist in a single bat [49]. Thus recombination between different bat CoVs could potentially occur in vivo, giving rise to new CoV genomes. Two strains of HCoV- HKU1 have recombined to yield a novel HCoV-HKU1 genotype [16], and recombination between different strains of SARS-CoV-like viruses in bats may have given rise to civet SARS-CoV [37]. The great diversity of CoVs, their high frequency of RNA recombination, their ability to persist in bat populations, and the finding that some CoVs can apparently infect bats of divergent genera, suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats may pose a continuing threat for emergence of novel CoVs into new hosts.",
