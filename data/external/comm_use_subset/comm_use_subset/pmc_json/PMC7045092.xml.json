            "text": "In the last decades, research into the behavioural factors influencing the hand hygiene behaviour of healthcare professionals has received growing attention.22 23 Assessment of hand hygiene behavioural factors has often been guided by behavioural theories, in particular the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB).24\u201328 The TPB states that individual behaviour is influenced by attitudes, social norms (ie, what people around you think and do) and self-efficacy (ie, whether you feel that you are able to perform the behaviour).29 This theory has been used to explain the behaviour of physicians and nurses, but not yet that of medical students. Only a few studies into factors explaining hand hygiene compliance among medical students have been conducted so far, most lacking a theoretical behavioural framework or restricted to environmental factors such as access to facilities (low access associated with low compliance) and compliance of peers and superiors (low compliance of medical staff associated with low student compliance).30 31 Van de Mortel et al\n16 32 33 investigated factors associated with the hand hygiene behavioural of students in Australia, Italy and Greece, showing that knowledge was regularly insufficient, differences in hand hygiene attitudes and behaviours between future doctors and nurses are already present at an undergraduate level and that better hand hygiene education is necessary. Therefore, to date knowledge is still rather limited on the behavioural factors that influence patient safety behaviours, including hand hygiene, of our next generation of physicians.34 These insights can help clinical educators to promote patient safety behaviour among medical students and thereby improve patient safety in the near future.",

Every 2 weeks, a group of 10 to 15 students started their Public Health training and were invited to complete a questionnaire. Before this internship, the students followed an 18-month rotation schedule in all major specialities: internal medicine, surgery, paediatrics, gynaecology, neurology, psychiatry, ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat medicine), dermatology and general practice. The interns rotated among the university medical centre and 20 non-academic hospitals within the region South-West Netherlands. These institutions serve over 6.3 million people of various social and ethnic backgrounds in a mixed urban and rural area. In the second year of the study, undergraduate medical students completed the compulsory 2-hour practical module \u2018Basic Hygiene\u2019 of the Unit Infection Prevention (Erasmus MC), in which they are taught the principles of hand hygiene, among other things.",

We added the following additional constructs: knowledge of the guidelines, risk perception (chance of infection occurring; severity of infection for self (ie, student) or patient) and habit (hand hygiene is something you do without thinking about it), measured with the self-report index of habit.37 Since the internal consistency was at least adequate for each construct (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 \u22650.70) we calculated average scores for use in further analysis (see table 1).

This rotation schedule also resulted in the use of a cross-sectional design, which restricts conclusions on causality. A longitudinal study would resolve this restriction but would be arduous due to the rotations and most likely result in a high numbers lost to follow-up and a much lower response rate as a result. Therefore the use of self-reported data in a cross-sectional design was the best option in our case.

Habit is a complex construct, referred to as a \u2018habitual mind-set\u2019 in which people focus less on new information, but rather fall back on previously formed automatic cue-responses, thereby maintaining that behaviour.46 Actions have to be repeated often enough in a stable context in order to shape a habitual mindset.

This effect is also present among residents, as with a senior member of the team performing hand hygiene, the hand hygiene compliance of residents increases significantly, but overall compliance of residents is as low as their qualified colleagues (<40%).47 It is therefore essential to break the vicious circle and one way to do this is by preparing medical students for the incongruences they will encounter in clinical practice and increase their coping skills.
