Although no new outbreaks have been reported since 2004 [3], reported biosecurity breaches of SARS-CoV specimens in research facilities [4\u20137] and continuous findings of SARS-like coronaviruses in wild animals [8\u201310] suggest the distinct potential for a resurgence of SARS [11\u201313].",

Understanding of the relative importance of the three routes is limited, so the recommended infection control measures (standard, contact, droplet and airborne precautions [12, 17]) have been vague and unfocused. Due to safety and ethical concerns, experiments on human subjects are not appropriate [18]. Several studies have proposed probable evidence for the airborne spread of the SARS-CoV based on the consistencies between bio-aerosol concentration distributions and reported attack rates [19\u201321], but no mechanism-based investigations exist for the fomite route. Nevertheless, the detection of positive environmental samples in SARS outbreak hospitals [22\u201324], infections caused by intranasal instillation in animal experiments [25, 26] and findings that hand washing reduces the infection rate [27\u201329] all reveal that the fomite route might have played a non-negligible role in transmission.",

Since the index inpatient was weak and bedridden [30], we excluded the possibility of the close contact route from the index patient to other inpatients and identified three hypotheses, namely the single-route long-range airborne transmission (Hypothesis 1 [Long Air]), the single-route fomite transmission (Hypothesis 2 [Fomite]) and the two-route combination (Hypothesis 3 [Long Air + Fomite]). Based on a typical 3-shift rotation over 24 hours, six routine round patterns of healthcare workers (HCWs) were considered. A multi-agent model (Fig 2) was developed to simulate the possible spread of the viruses from the index patient to the susceptible by air flow and surface touching, and to calculate the possible exposure doses and infection risks for each hypothesis. Model selection was carried out in 1,744 scenarios with various combinations of 4 important parameters. The results reported as follows provide probable evidence for the additional fomite transmission of the SARS-CoV under assumed conditions.",

As his condition deteriorated with difficulty in expectorating sputum, he was treated with salbutamol via a jet nebulizer four times a day from March 6 to March 12 to facilitate mucociliary clearance [20]. On March 13, 2003, after he was identified as the index patient for the outbreak, he was transferred to an isolation room [20].

First, six representative HCWs\u2019 routine round patterns were considered, and the contact modes between HCWs and different patients were assumed to be the same. As shown in Fig 3C and Figure D(iii) in S1 File, doctors and nurses were responsible for all of the inpatients, and they examined all of the patients in the ward in clockwise and anticlockwise directions in Patterns 1 and 2, respectively. As shown in Fig 3E and Figure D(v) in S1 File, each doctor and each nurse was responsible for inpatients in a cubicle, and examined them in clockwise and anticlockwise directions in Patterns 3 and 4, respectively. In addition, in the scenario in which doctors or nurses allocated the patients in the order in which they checked in, the inpatients for whom a doctor or a nurse took responsibility might have been random. In that scenario, each doctor and each nurse examined a random nine or ten inpatients (e.g., circles of four colours in Fig 3G and Figure D(vii) in S1 File) in the ward in clockwise and anticlockwise directions in Patterns 5 and 6, respectively.",

Virus-containing airborne droplets were generated by the index patient in the source cubicle, leading to the highest virus concentration in the air in the source cubicle (Figure C in S1 File) and thus the highest infection risk (Fig 3B). Due to the small temperature differences between zones, two-way airflow occurred at each inner opening in the ward [35], so some virus-containing airborne droplets spread to other cubicles by airflow. As the remote cubicles were farther away from the source than the adjacent cubicle was, the airborne droplet concentrations in the former were further diluted than that in the latter (Figure C in S1 File), leading to lower infection risk (Fig 3B). With the high mechanical ventilation rates in Ward 8A, the results from both CFD simulations [20] and multi-zone modelling methods ([35] and Figure C in S1 File) show that the aerosol concentration in the source cubicle was much higher than that in the adjacent cubicle. Therefore, the difference between infection risks (Fig 3B) in the source and adjacent cubicles was very large (1:0.43 in this scenario), which was inconsistent with the small difference (1:0.80) in the reported attack rate distribution (Fig 3A). Although several studies showed the very probable evidences for the airborne transmission of SARS such as in the Amoy Gardens outbreak [19], the inconsistence suggests that the outbreak might not merely be induced by the long-range airborne route.",

In Patterns 3 and 4 (Fig 3F and Figure D(vi) in S1 File), as different groups of HCWs were responsible for different cubicles, HCWs did not transmit viruses across cubicles, and thus the infection risks for inpatients in the adjacent cubicle and remote cubicles were nearly the same.

Moreover, several parameters such as dose response parameters might be variable from patient to patient, but the individual differences were not considered in this study, which decreases the diversity of predicted infection risk distributions. Experimental investigations of SARS-CoV are lacking mainly because of safety considerations [18]; and several authors have suggested 229E, a low-virulence human coronavirus [45], as a surrogate [18, 40]. In future, more experimental measurements of parameters for the biological properties of SARS-CoV or the surrogate, 229E, are needed.",

However, different patients might have different timings of admission, discharge, or symptom onset, and thus different exposure periods. Ignoring the individual differences in the exposure periods reduces the diversity of infection risk distributions, and leads to omission of several possible scenarios. Moreover, the transmission from early-onset cases to the later cases might have occurred, according to the illness onset dates reported by Li et al. [20]. Neglecting the exposure doses caused by these early-onset cases results in underestimation of infection risk for other cases, which affects the distribution patterns of infection risk in the ward. In future, more detailed information about the timing for patients should be recorded in outbreak reports of infectious diseases.",
