            "text": "Pre-weaning diarrhea (PWD) in mink kits is a well recognized disease in farmed mink (Neovison vison) and appears as a syndrome commonly referred to as \u201csticky kits\u201d, \u201cwet kits\u201d or \u201cgreasy kits\u201d [1]. Every year, outbreaks occur on mink farms with considerable economic losses for the farmers as well as decreased welfare for the affected animals. The syndrome typically affects all kits in a litter and is characterized by a yellow-white diarrhea. Concurrently, a greasy exudate on the skin spreads from the neck over the back and trunk and out on the limbs, claws and tail. The anal region becomes red and swollen, and if the diarrhea is severe, dehydration develops [1, 2]. The number of affected farms and the severity within the farms varies across years. The morbidity may reach over 30% of litters on a farm [1]. Affected mink kits show distressed behavior. Average mortality may vary between less than 1 and up to 2 kits per litter [1]. Studies have been focusing on the factors, which are associated with PWD. Several viruses have been identified in diarrheic mink kits including astrovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus and rotavirus [3\u20139], but most of these viruses have also been found in healthy mink kits [3, 4, 7].",

            "text": "Studies of bacteria from intestines of mink kits with PWD, have mainly focused on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus spp. [7\u201310]. Both hemolytic and non-hemolytic E. coli strains have been isolated from diarrheic and healthy kits. These were further characterized, but differences in serotypes or virulence factors between diseased and non-diseased kits have not been identified [7, 10]. Therefore, the strains of E. coli are considered as opportunistic pathogens in weakened kits [7]. PWD has been associated with Staphylococcus delphini [9] and Staphylococcus intermedius [8]. The S. intermedius group (SIG) was reclassified and holds S. delphini group A [11]. However, mink are natural hosts of S. delphini and healthy mink kits host hemolytic staphylococci in their guts especially at the beginning of the nursing period [12, 13]. Hence, the microbial pattern associated with PWD is somewhat ambiguous. In general, the syndrome should be regarded as a multifactorial disease complex [1, 2], where factors such as feed producer, climate and population density have been reported to be significantly associated with the condition [2]. Dam-associated factors are also of concern for the development of PWD. Severe weight loss of the dam and restriction of feed allowance during the winter and late gestation period have been shown to increase the risk of PWD [14\u201316]. Large litters and litters from young dams have been found to have increased risk of PWD [15], and the immune status of the dam may also be of importance for development of PWD [17, 18]. Concurrent with PWD, mastitis is often a problem on the farms and has been hypothesized to be associated with the syndrome [2]. Moreover, mastitis has been reported to be associated with increased mortality in dams as well as in mink kits during the lactation period [19, 20]. Clinical manifestations of mastitis in mink dams are decreased appetite, lethargy and swelling of mammary gland(s). Bacterial cultures from mammary tissue often reveal E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus [20, 21], however, some of the staphylococci reported as S. aureus by these authors may have included other Staphylococcus species, which were later described. The pathology of Staphylococcus-associated mastitis typically shows a suppurative inflammation with abscessation, whereas mastitis caused by E. coli tends to be fibrino-necrotizing [21]. However, classical signs of inflammation are rarely seen in mink with mastitis and no method has been developed to diagnose subclinical mastitis in mink [19, 22]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the prevalence of subclinical mastitis and its impact on mink health have been underestimated on mink farms [19, 21]. A study on an experimental farm enclosing 12 females with and without pre-weaning diarrhea did not show an association between PWD and mastitis [22], but no studies have been done on a greater spectrum of farms and have not evaluated if mastitis could be a risk factor among several others, which have been identified in this disease complex. The aims of this study were to examine associations between PWD in the mink litter and the presence of mastitis in terms of bacterial infection and histological signs of inflammation in the mammary gland of the dam, and to examine associations between PWD in the litter and other characteristics concerning the dam: age, litter size, body mass index (BMI), weight and number of mammary glands per kit, and the presence of other pathologic manifestations.",

Seventy mink dams and their litter of mink kits used for this study were sampled in a two stage sampling process from 25 Danish Aleutian mink disease (AMDV) free farms. In stage one, 10 farms were conveniently selected among farms with a high prevalence of PWD and 15 farms were conveniently selected among farms with a low prevalence of PWD. In stage two, dams and mink kits from litters with clinical signs of PWD and dams and their litters without clinical signs of PWD were conveniently sampled by the investigation team within the farms among litters presented by the farmer. The dam was then sedated with 12.5 mg ketamine and 5 mg xylazine given intramuscularly in a hindleg and euthanized by an intrahepatic injection of pentobarbital. From each litter, 2\u20133 kits were haphazardly selected and euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital injected into the liver. Afterwards, the necropsies were carried out. The final categorization of diseased (PWD+) and non-diseased litters (PWD\u2212) was based on the clinical assessment combined with the post mortem examination of the intestinal contents in the rectum, or at post mortem \u201cdefecation\u201d. This was done in order to assure that mink litters with kits having liquid feces but no external signs of diarrhea were allocated to the PWD+ group. None of the dams or kits had been treated with antibiotics. Hence, the PWD+ group consisted of 29 litters (n = 29) and, the PWD\u2212 group consisted of 41 litters (n = 41). The study unit was the litter.",

Litter PWD status for all litters included in this study was based on concordant kit PWD status of the kits within each litter. The intestinal contents were scored in terms of consistency (score 1\u20134) and color (score a) as follows; (1) firm to normal soft, log-shaped, moist with a smooth surface, (2) soft without shape, very moist with cow-pat consistency, (3) runny, loose intestinal contents with no defined shape but with some texture, (4) liquid, not containing any particular matter, no texture, may be foamy, (a) if white or beige color as a sign of undigested milk. Kits with score \u201c3\u201d, \u201c4\u201d and/or \u201ca\u201d, were judged to have diarrhea without regard to the external signs (swollen red anus, dirty perineal region or cutaneous exudation on head, legs, trunk, tail or paws).

The analytical unit was the mink litter. The outcome variable was disease status of the litter (PWD+ or PWD\u2212). Due to the limited number of dams and their litters in the study (n = 70), the unbalanced data and to avoid issues of modeling non-linear relationships and to avoid excessive numbers of categories we dichotomized all explanatory variables. The explanatory variable \u201cage\u201d was categorized as \u201c1 year\u201d and \u201c> 1 year\u201d, because it is known from previous studies that there was a higher frequency of PWD among the young than among the old dams [15], and because the farmers at the end of the season the previous year usually keep the best 1 year old dams for next years breeding stock, i.e. selective survival. The number of kits observed after birth was categorized as \u201c\u2264 5 kits\u201d and \u201c> 5 kits\u201d, because the national average of kits per litter is around 5. The variable BMI was categorized as \u201c\u2264 17.7\u201d and \u201c> 17.7\u201d using the mean value as cut off because there was no other biological good choice. The weight of the mammary glands and the number of active mammary glands were divided by the number of living kits at the day of examination to compensate for the influence of the number of kits had on these variables. The number of mammary glands per kit was categorized as \u201c\u2264 1.5\u201d and \u201c> 1.5\u201d because this is around the average number of glands per kit according to the general number of 8 glands per dam and the average number of 5 kits in a litter in the population. The weight of the mammary gland per kit was dichotomized with a cutoff at the average of the two group means (PWD+ and PWD\u2212, respectively), because there was no other biological good choice. Thus the categories were \u2264 12.19 g versus > 12.19 g gland per kit. Bacterial growth of the mammary gland was categorized as positive or negative. The variables concerning the histopathologic evaluation were categorized as described under \u201cHistopathological assessments\u201d.",

Due to the study design, farm-level PWD status (low vs. high) as a fixed effect and farm id as a random intercept were forced into all models. Initially, all other explanatory variables were examined, while only controlling for farm effects and farm-level PWD-status, for their association with litter PWD-status. Subsequently, a final multivariable mixed logistic regression model was fitted. The models were fitted using proc glimmix (SAS) with specification of the logit link function and the binominal distribution. Thus, all analyses were conducted as mixed model logistic regression according to the following generalized linear mixed model equation:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Logit}}\\left( {{\\text{p}}_{\\text{ij}} } \\right)\\, = \\,\\upbeta0\\, + \\,\\upbeta 1 {\\text{ X1}}_{\\text{ij}} \\, + \\, \\cdots \\, + \\,\\upbeta{\\text{k Xk}}_{\\text{ij}} \\, + \\,\\upmu{\\text{farm}}_{\\text{j}} ,$$\\end{document}Logitpij=\u03b20+\u03b21X1ij+\u22ef+\u03b2k Xkij+\u03bcfarmj,where \u00b5farm is the random effect (variance component) of the individual farm containing (dam + litter)ij and is assumed to be normally distributed with a constant variance (\u00b5farm ~ N(0, \u03c32farm)). The Xij\u2019s are the predictor values for the i\u2019th dam (and litter), in the j\u2019th farm, and the relationship between the probability pij and the binary outcome Yi is unchanged: p(Yi = 1) = pi [26]. Variable selection was done in a backward manual elimination process using the \u2212 2Log Pseudo-Likelihood estimates for comparison of the nested models. The overall model-fit was based on the general-Chi-square/DF being close to 1 [27]. The contribution of each explanatory variable to the model was evaluated as marginal sums of squares and the associated F-test of fixed effects using the Type I error cutoff at \u03b1 = 0.05. At each modeling step the variable with the highest P-value above \u03b1 = 0.05 was eliminated. The default estimation method of the generalized linear mixed model was the Residual Log Pseudo Likelihood. Other estimation methods were also assessed (MSPL, RMPL, MMPL and Laplace), but they did not improve the fit of the model assessed on the general-Chi-square/DF. Therefore, the default estimation method was chosen. The final model was assessed using Pearson standardized residual plots. The impact of identified observations with extreme residual value was assessed by comparing the models with and without this observation. All multivariable models are presented with odds ratio estimates and associated P-values and 95% confidence intervals (2 decimals) for the explanatory variables. A test for collinearity between the explanatory variables in the final model was assessed by estimating the Phi coefficient, similar to the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. After identification of the final set of significant variables addition of all two-way interaction terms to the model, one at a time, were evaluated. Presence of confounding in this multivariable model was assessed by comparing the adjusted OR estimates in this model to the crude OR estimated in models with only one exposure variable. A change in the OR estimate > 20% was considered and indication of confounding. Thus, all the variables that were stratified for were considered confounders.",

            "text": "We found that PWD in the mink litter was associated with the age of the dam, litter size, the number of active mammary glands per kit and the farms PWD status. Odds of PWD were significantly higher in litters from 1-year old dams compared to older dams. This is consistent with previous studies showing that dams of first year had a higher risk of PWD in the litter compared to older dams [15, 28]. A speculated reason for this might be a lower quality of nursing skills in young dams or a lesser transfer of maternal immunity to the kits. However, mink are like other production animals selected for high performance such as reproduction, growth and pelt quality; hence, older dams are expected to be more robust animals to remain in the herd which may also explain this effect of dam age. High litter size also increased the odds of PWD in the mink litter, which is in line with previous studies [15, 28]. This may have caused a more competitive pressure among the kits in the litter and may have resulted in different kinds of stress. However, in our study we only used the dam and 2\u20133 kits from each litter. The remaining kits in the litter were after euthanization of the dam reallocated to other dams in the farm. To reduce this need for fostering care of remaining mink kits, mink farmers probably tended to present smaller litters to the investigation team at the time of sampling. We do not know the sampling fractions of large (< 5) and small (\u2264 5) litters in the farms, but believe the sampling fractions of large litters were lower than of small litters. This is also reflected in the mean litter sizes of PWD+ and PWD\u2212 litters, i.e. 5.5 and 3.2 kits per litter, respectively. If this is true, the ratio of sampling fractions [26] for large and small litters among PWD+ and among PWD\u2212 litters are equally affected. Therefore, the estimated odds ratio for association between litter size and PWD in the final model is believed to be close to the true population odds ratio, and thus not selection biased. Odds of PWD were higher among litters with fewer active mammary glands per kit. This finding suggests that mink kits in litters with restricted access to milk supply have increased risk of PWD. This may be due to a decreased transfer of humoral immunity (IgG) by the milk, which recently in mink has been shown to be litter specific and to some extend correlated to the IgG levels in the dam [17]. The statistically significant contribution to the multivariable model of \u2018farm PWD status\u2019 is very likely a proxy for the presence of other important risk factors on the farms than the ones included in our study, e.g. management regarding feeding, hygiene and biosecurity.",

            "text": "We examined the association between PWD and the presence of bacterial infection and microscopic lesions in the mammary gland of the dam. Bacteria were grown from the mammary glands of 12.9% of the dams, and since the majority of the samples were culture negative, it indicates that our sampling technique was adequate to avoid contamination. Isolates from the S. intermedius group were most commonly identified, and many of the cultures were monocultures which most likely reflect a true ascending infection of the mammary gland. Isolates belonging to the S. intermedius group from mink is most likely represented by S. delphini group A, which has been isolated from different body locations and is a normal inhabitant in mustelids [12]. We did not identify E. coli from mammary glands which, however, is a quite common isolate from mink mammary tissue from dead or euthanized dams sent for routine laboratory diagnostics (National Veterinary Institute, Denmark, unpublished). One reason for this difference may be that the population of dams in the present study may represent a broader spectrum of less severe mammary infection. There was not a significant association in the multivariable model between PWD and growth of bacteria in the mammary gland of the dam. Neither could we demonstrate dominance of the same bacterial species in the gut of the respective mink kits, which also counts against an association between PWD and mammary infection. Bacterial isolation from the mammary gland does not necessarily implicate inflammation as isolates may be recovered from dormancy or are newly established. It is likely that some bacterial strains, e.g. S. intermedius group or S. aureus are more pathogenic than others and result in more inflammation which could be of interest in future studies. However, PWD was not associated with inflammation defined as infiltration of PNL or MNL, and other lesions of the mammary gland, which is in line with another study where no association between PWD and mastitis was found [22]. The implications of finding no relation between PWD and mastitis suggest that PWD occurs independently of mastitis. However, a general weakening of the immune system of the mink dams might result in a higher prevalence of both PWD and mastitis on certain farms. A shortcoming of this study is the one-time investigation without the opportunity to follow-up, during a period covering an incubation period. Furthermore, we did not examine all mammary glands from the dams, but selected those suspected of being inflamed. Material for this study was collected from commercial mink farms and was dependent on spontaneous outbreaks of PWD. Sample size calculations were impossible to make due to lack of information on associations to risk factors examined, and this might have resulted in a lack of statistical power. However, we consider not having selection bias due to convenience sampling of farms. The farms included in this study were selected from different Danish geographical regions, supplied by different feed producers and with various veterinarian advisors and thus believed to be representative of commercial Danish AMDV-free mink farms. The high and low prevalence farms are, therefore, believed to be representative of the farm populations with high and low prevalence of litters with PWD. Our study includes the most important risk factors, based on literature and our biological knowledge. This paper has focused on dam-related characteristics associated with PWD, which are relevant because the mink kits at risk of PWD are in the suckling state of life and totally dependent on the dam. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the etiology of this syndrome. Microbiological analyses of material collected from the examined mink kits will be reported elsewhere.",
