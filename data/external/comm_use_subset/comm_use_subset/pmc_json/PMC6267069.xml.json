It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally, particularly in Asia and Africa, and ranks alongside human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as a leading cause of death worldwide [1]. In 2017, an estimated 1.7 billion individuals were newly infected with the causative agent of TB [1]. However, only 5\u201315% of them will develop TB during their lifetime [2]. The outcome of TB infection is affected by many factors, such as malnutrition, co-infection with other pathogens, exposure to microbes and previous vaccination [3]. It was reported that host genetic factors play a crucial role in determining an individual\u2019s susceptibility to TB [4]. Recently, a number of genes potentially associated with TB susceptibility have been analysed in case-control studies.",

            "text": "Studies performed in mouse models and in patients indicate an important role of interferon (IFN) during TB infection [5, 6]. IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 play significant immunomodulatory roles in the protection of the host against infections. As the main mediator of the type II immune response, IFN-\u03b3 is critical for controlling infections by intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacteria [7]. Specifically, IFN-\u03b3 plays a vital role in resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) by activating macrophages, monocytes and Th1 cells [8]. 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) are IFN-inducible enzymes that play vital roles in the innate immune response against viruses. The OAS family includes OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OAS-like (OASL) protein. The OAS1 gene encodes OAS1, which is an extensively characterized enzyme induced by IFNs [9]. Binding of IFNs to their specific receptors results in induction of OAS1 gene expression [10]. OAS1 is activated by the presence of double-stranded RNA and stimulates the oligomerisation of ATP into 2\u2032,5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) [11]. 2-5A can bind to latent ribonuclease L (RNase L), which then dimerizes into the active form. This active form facilitates apoptosis [12], attenuates proliferation [13] and inhibits protein synthesis [13]. It is possible that polymorphisms in OAS1 influence the expression of IFN-\u03b3, the elimination of MTB, and ultimately affect the development of TB [14, 15].",

OAS2 play an important role in the control of bacterial infection through direct interaction with pattern-recognition receptors. It also has immunomodulatory function through immune cell receptor interaction [16]. In terms of the ability to synthesize 2-5A, OAS3 shows higher activity than OAS1 [17]. OAS3 is specialized for binding long dsRNA. The major function of OAS3 during infection is to produce 2-5A activators of RNaseL [18]. In contrast to other OAS family members, OASL lacks any synthetic activity. OASL has the ability to regulate type I IFN responses when infected with pathogens. It has been suggested that OASL could act as a regulator in the control of antiviral innate immunity through IFN signalling [19].",

For example, SNPs in OAS1 have been identified as candidates for susceptibility to viral infections, such as West Nile virus [20], hepatitis C [21], Chikungunya [22], dengue [23] and measles [24]. Previous data also indicated that OAS1 polymorphisms and haplotypes were potential risk factors for autoimmune conditions, including type 1 diabetes [25] and multiple sclerosis [26].

As the genetic determinants of TB were age- and gender-dependent [29, 30], logistic regression was used to adjust for gender and age. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were examined to estimate the magnitude of the risk. LD and haplotype analyses were conducted using the SHEsis online software platform (http://analysis.bio-x.cn). A 2-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and P values were conservatively Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons. Power calculation was performed (\u03b1 = 0.05) by Quanto software (version 1.2.4, May 2009). The power of the two cohorts to detect relative risks (RR) of 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 using the four SNPs studied under an allele genetic model were estimated by the Quanto software and are listed in Table S1. The two cohorts have reasonable power (> 80%) to detect genetic factors with RR 2.0 and above under the allele model in all four SNPs (Table S1). Gene-gene interaction was detected using the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) software and MDR permutation testing module (http://www.epistasis.org and http://sourceforge.net/projects/mdr/files/mdrpt).

            "text": "OAS1 is an enzyme that plays an important role in innate antiviral defence [34]. This enzyme is activated by the presence of double-stranded or single-stranded RNA with a secondary structure and catalyses the oligomerisation of ATP into 2-5A [35]. These processes activate latent RNase L, which degrades viral and cellular RNA and blocks protein synthesis. In accordance with this function, human OAS1 mainly affects susceptibility to viral infections [35, 36]. Given the importance of the OAS1 protein, SNPs in the OAS1 gene may affect susceptibility to infectious diseases. In the present study, we demonstrated that polymorphisms in OAS1 were associated with TB. It is unclear why the heightened antiviral enzyme activity in individuals was associated with TB, but this association may be explained as follows. One explanation is that the major role of the OAS proteins is as immune regulators in innate immunity, although previous studies indicated that they also play important roles in other cellular functions. The role of OAS1 in immune-related diseases has been shown by a number of association studies [25, 26]. It is well known that the immune response against TB plays a critical role in the progression of MTB infection. Another explanation is that the OAS1 gene affects susceptibility to TB through the type II IFN pathway [14, 15]. Type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) is critical for host defence against certain bacterial and parasitic pathogens [37]. IFN-\u03b3 can activate infected host macrophages to inhibit the replication of MTB directly [38]. In addition, OAS gene expression was regulated by both type I and type II IFNs [39]. A previous study suggested that IFN-\u03b3 could increase the levels of OAS mRNA [40]. Furthermore, OAS1 gene up-regulation was observed in several gene expression signatures that differentiated active TB from latent TB infection [41, 42]. It was also established that there was a prominent correlation between OAS expression and TB [14]. Moreover, data from Noguchi et al. revealed the potential role of OAS1 polymorphisms in respiratory infection [27]. Therefore, we assume that the polymorphism in the OAS gene may be associated with the risk of TB infection through the type II IFN pathway.",

            "text": "As a functional OAS1 polymorphic marker, rs10774671 was reported to be associated with disease/viral infection [36, 43]. rs10774671 is located at the last nucleotide of intron 6 in OAS1, which acts as a splice-acceptor site for exon 7. The G allele was demonstrated to allow splicing to occur leading to the production of a p46 form with high enzymatic OAS activity [20]. The rs10774671 A allele usually prevents splicing at this site and thus splicing happens further downstream, resulting in the p48 and p52 forms associated with low OAS enzymatic activity. rs10774671 could also control other splice variants of OAS including p42 and p44 [20]. In addition, the HapMap genotypic data (Fig. 2) of rs10774671 suggested that individuals with GG genotype had lower expression levels than those with AA and GA genotypes. However, rs10774671 GG genotype was reported to be associated with the highest enzyme activity of OAS1 in unstimulated lymphocytes [44]. The inconsistent results between mRNA expression and enzyme activity may attribute to the reason that gene expressions at the transcriptional and translational levels might be different. Our data were partly consistent with these observations, in that the G allele and GG genotype had significant protective effects against TB, whereas the AG genotype was not associated with TB. Furthermore, this result was validated in the Chinese Han population. Considering the aforementioned functional effects of rs10774671 on phenotypes, we speculate that rs10774671 could alter OAS1 expression levels precluding the type I IFN pathway resulting in a protective response.",

However, rs2240190, rs1131454 and rs10774671 formed the best gene-gene interaction model. This result was consistent with the phenomenon that most diseases including TB are caused by multiple factors and gene-gene or gene-environment interactions are characteristic of the genetic factors. In addition, we also conducted a haplotype analysis which was based on the association between a polymorphism and the ancestral haplotype [45]. However, inconsistent with the gene-gene interaction result, there was no significant association between haplotypes and TB. Since the haplotype analysis approach was used for analyzing haplotype effects at numerous closely linked loci, and the gene-gene interaction analysis could be used for analyzing the unlinked loci [46, 47]. We speculate the discrepant results are likely attributable to different methods.",

Only one study suggested that this genetic polymorphism was not in LD with rs10774671 [27]. rs1131454 (formerly rs3741981), in the evolutionarily conserved exon 3, is nonsynonymous (the G \u2192 A transition results in a G \u2192 S amino acid change). This polymorphic locus is close to the dsRNA binding domain of all OAS1 isoforms. In general, the AA, GA and GG genotypes of rs1131454 lead to low, intermediate and high OAS1 enzyme activity, respectively [44]. This polymorphic locus was demonstrated to be functional in the progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome [49].
