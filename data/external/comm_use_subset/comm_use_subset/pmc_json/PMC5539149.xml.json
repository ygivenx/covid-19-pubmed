            "text": "Ascoviruses (Ascoviridae) are circular double-stranded DNA viruses of insects that attack the most common lepidopteran species of the Noctuidae, Crambidae and Plutellidae families1\u20133. Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3h genome length is 190, 519 bp and is a strain of the species Heliothis virescens ascovirus 3a4, 5. HvAV-3h has strong pathogenicity to S. exigua, Spodoptera litura and Helicoverpa armigera\n6\u20138. However, ascoviruses must be transmitted by parasitoid wasps in the field. A potential application value of ascoviruses for bio-control was predicted because of the dissemination system and acute pathogenic features of ascoviruses, which was different from other insect viruses, e.g., nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV). Research on the pathogenic molecular mechanisms is relatively deficient for ascoviruses, and research on implementing a stabile reference gene for ascoviruses has not been performed. RT-qPCR is usually used in research on pathogenic molecular mechanisms. To achieve RNA quantitation and data normalization with different samples, we selected an optimal reference gene to correct the reliability and accuracy of quantitative results. Due to its simple operation, high sensitivity, low pollution and good repeatability, RT-qPCR is widely used in basic science research9. However, diverse samples have different RNA efficiencies of extraction, RNA quality, and reverse transcription efficiency of the product10. Therefore, it is important to ensure a high quality of RNA in RT-qPCR11. Generally, housekeeping genes are considered to be relatively stable expressed in all cell types and physiological states12. However, some studies have indicated that the expression quantity of housekeeping genes in different cell types, tissues, experimental conditions and under different physiological states is inconsistent13, 14. For example, ACT was unsuitable as a reference gene when human cell lines were infected by cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus-6, camelpox virus, SARS coronavirus or yellow fever virus, and TBP and PPI were the most stable reference genes15. When Spodoptera frugiperda cells were infected with Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), the results indicated that ECD was a reliable reference gene for RT-qPCR and was better than 28S as a reference gene for these experiments16. Incorporation of the 28S reverse primer in oligo-dT-primed cDNA synthesis showed lower and less variable cycle thresholds in cells infected by viruses17. PPIA was set as the single, most-optimal internal reference gene for Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) infection experiments in Bombus terrestris\n18. In various experimental settings and different tissues, rRNA genes were unsuitable as references gene because their transcription was significantly regulated19. 18S RNA and ACT have been commonly employed as reference genes in Hymenoptera studies16, 20, Meanwhile, a suitable and stable reference gene was significant for the calibration of the qRT-PCR data.",

IAPs are a kind of widely distributed endogenous apoptosis suppressor protein, which plays an important role in inhibitor apoptosis in many species21. Therefore, iap-like1 and iap-like2 are probably associated with the molecular mechanism of rapid pathogenesis and chronic death in larvae. The iap genes are detectable in the most of the baculovirus genomes, such as AcMNPV, CpGV (Cydia pomonella granulovirus), OpMNPV (Orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus) and BmNPV (Bombyx mori nuclear polyhydrosis virus)22, 23.

Application of the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper tools was based on the Microsoft Excel program. When geNorm and NormFinder tools performed a stable analysis of the data, the cycle threshold (Ct) was converted into a linear scale (the highest relative quantity for each gene was set to 1). The geNorm algorithm calculated an expression stable value (M) for each gene and then compared the pair-wise variation Vn/Vn + 1. The gene with the lowest M value represented the most stable expression. A ratio of Vn/Vn + 1 below 0.15 indicated that the use of an additional reference gene would not significantly improve normalization33. NormFinder combined the interclass variance and intraclass variance to calculate a stable value. The assessment of the reference gene stability was dependent on the size of the stable value34. The raw data of cycle threshold (Ct) values (CP values) and PCR efficiency (E) of the reference genes were determined as the best fitted standards by BestKeeper. The cardinal principle for identification of stably expressed reference genes by Bestkeeper was that the expression levels of suitable reference genes should be highly correlated. Therefore, the correlation between each candidate gene and the index was calculated, describing the relation between the index and the contributing candidate reference gene by the highest R value, lowest SD and CV values (<1) and the P value35. We also used the online software RefFinder, which integrates the above-mentioned four algorithms (geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the delta Ct method) to compare and rank the examined candidate reference genes. According to the results of RefFinder, candidate genes with the top rankings were considered to be the most stably expressed under the tested experimental conditions and thus could be selected as optimal reference genes. Every gene was sorted by the five different statistical approaches separately.",

HvAV-3h has been recently isolated from S. exigua\n4. Li found that the early instars of S. exigua were significantly easier to infect with HvAV-3h compared to the later instars, using 10-fold serial dilutions (0 to 7) of HvAV-3h-containing hemolymph to infect S. litura larvae. There were no significant differences in larval mortalities from 100- to 103-fold dilutions; however, significant declines were observed at the 104-fold dilution and above7. Compared to the healthy larval population, the typical symptoms and survival times of the diseased larval population were considerably extended, food intake was significantly reduced, and the body weight remained fairly constant in the 3rd and 4th instar larvae, which happened after inoculation with the ascovirus. However, the corrected mortality rates for the 1st through 5th instar inoculated per os were very low8. Therefore, the ascovirus mode of dissemination, which relies on the parasitoid wasp M. similis, served as a vector when the female parasitoid wasp acquired the virus. The ovipositor with the virion viability was 4.1 \u00b1 1.4 days, and infected host larvae were still acceptable for egg laying by parasitoids. The parasitoids thereafter transmitted the virus to healthy hosts26. It follows that ascoviruses, with this dissemination system, have probably been regarded as significant for long-term pest control. Moreover, there are few studies that have elucidated the selection of reference genes for ascovirus infection dissemination systems. Therefore, stable expression of reference gene (s) is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of rapid pathogenesis and chronic death.",

At present, according to differences between physiological stages and different tissues in S. exigua, their suitability as reference genes was diverse with each treatment. In general, SOD, ACT2, ACT1, EF1 and GAPDH were stably expressed in all developmental stage sample sets. L10, EF2, L17A and EF1 were ranked highest in all tissue sample sets30, 39. The expression of these internal genes is considerably different in different experimental conditions. We therefore reassessed the stability before RT-qPCR testing. Our results indicated that EF1 ranked hi4ghest in all sample sets by RefFinder, Delta Ct and Normfinder, whereas the BestKeeper method ranked ACT1 as the best reference gene and EF1 ranked at the fifth position. The subtle differences in ranking among the top order reference genes could be imputed to differences in algorithms of the employed software programs and sensitivities towards the co-regulated reference genes.",

However, HvAV-3e did not replicate in the Pieris rapae (Pieridae) cell line, which was non-noctuid43. This means that ascoviruses were likely to impact the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line, which was derived from the fat body of S. exigua. Consequently, stable reference genes can be helpful in further research on the cytopathic effect of ascoviruses. This study showed that the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line was susceptible to infection by ascoviruses. AcMNPV could also easily infect the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line16, 44. It has been reported that with the selection of reference genes in the Sf21 cell line infected by ascoviruses, DNA-free RNA was used as a template with a combination of the Sf21 cell line 28S gene-specific reverse primer and the oligo-dT primer for first strand cDNA synthesis. The results indicated that the Ct values were significantly higher and more variable during the course of viral infection when only the oligo-dT primer was used in the cDNA synthesis step than when the 28S-R primer in conjunction with the oligo-dT primer was used16, although the stability of the reference genes was not analyzed by the geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and delta cycle threshold (Ct) method and Online software RefFinder. In our study, we applied the conventional synthesis method of cDNA using RefFinder, Delta Ct, geNorm, Normfinder and BestKeeper algorithms to analyze the Ct values. As a consequence, the results indicated that 28S was the least suitable gene in the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line across all samples, while the EF2 gene was expressed most stably in comparison with 8 other candidate internal genes. Generally, the most stable reference gene of the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line and S. exigua should provide the same results. We acquired EF2 and L17A, which were relatively stable in screening of the reference genes for S. exigua and the IOZCAS-Spex -II-A cell line. However, in S. exigua, EF1 was the top-ranked by RefFinder, Delta Ct and NormFinder but was in the fifth positon by BestKeeper and the third position by geNorm. This phenomenon was probably due to the virus being able to directly impact the cell line; however, virus attack of insects may be influenced by other factors such as pH values, environmental temperature and host larvae with different instars.",
