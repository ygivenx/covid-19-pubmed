Mammarenavirus particles are spherical to pleomorphic in shape and, range from 40 to 300 nm in diameter [2]. The virus particle carries a variable number of ribosomes (20\u201325 nm) from host cells that are responsible for their sandy, or arena-like, appearance under electron microscopy[3]. Mammarenavirus possess a bi-segmented, ambisense, single-stranded RNA genome. The L and S segments share conserved sequences at both ends and are around 7.2 and 3.5 kb long, respectively [4]. Each genomic RNA encodes two different proteins in opposite orientations [5]. The two open reading frames (ORFs) in each segment are separated by an intergenic noncoding region that forms one or more energetically stable stem-loop (hairpin) structures [6]. The L segment encodes a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, L) and a zinc binding matrix protein (Z). The S segment encodes a nucleoprotein (NP) and an envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC) [2].",

Most mammarenaviruses induce a persistent and frequently asymptomatic infection in their reservoir hosts and are associated with a specific host species or group of species [10]. Mammarenaviruses can be transmitted through rodent urine or blood [11]. Humans usually become infected through contact with infected rodents or inhalation of infectious rodent excreta or secretions [2]. Animal models, such as hamsters, mice, guinea pigs, and non-human primates, have been used to study the pathogenicity of mammarenaviruses and to measure vaccine or drug efficacy [12]. Viral infections have been identified in many organs, including the spleen, liver, adrenal gland, placenta, and lungs [10, 13\u201317].",

Lassa virus (LASV) causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) with a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year in West Africa[19, 20], whilst Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus, Sab\u00eda virus, and Guanarito virus cause fatal hemorrhagic fever diseases and had a mortality rate between 20 and 30% in Latin America[18, 21]. In 2014, a rodent arenavirus, WENV was identified in W\u0113nzh\u014du, Zhejiang Province, China [8]. In 2015, a genetic variant of WENV, associated with influenza-like illness, was found in Cambodia and Thailand [22]. Recently, similar virus sequences were reported in Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces, China [9, 23\u201326].",

But the diversity within that clade also revealed an independent lineage of Asian arenaviruses[8, 9, 22, 24, 25]. The phylogenetic tree based on partial L sequences had different shape with the tree based on complete length of L segment suggesting more complexity evolution of WENV. Meanwhile, the tree topologies for the L and S segments of the Yunnan isolates are also incongruent. In the L tree, the Yunnan strains are separated according to the two sampling locations irrespective of host species, while two strains from different locations are closely related in the S tree (Fig 3). Recombination analysis suggested that one of the Yunnan strains, WENV/Rn2016YM03, results from an S segment recombination event between WENV/Rn2016YL04 and WENV/Rt2015YM16. We hypothesize that the divergence of the viruses between the two locations is a recent event caused by host movement. More evolution models and more viruses complete genome sequences were needed to improve the understanding of WENV evolution.",

In Cambodia, the WENV was associated with human respiratory diseases. In this study, we have gained both molecular and serological evidence to demonstrate that brown rats (R. norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi) are the major natural host of WENVs. In Yunnan, these two rodent species are the dominant species and commensal with humans, suggesting a high risk of spillover of WENVs and occurrence of similar respiratory illness cases caused by WENV infection. Thus the ELISA method developed in this study can serve as a tool for screening WENV antibodies in undiagnosed fever patients. In Yunnan Province, the Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HRFS) and Dengue fever are also occurring, which may lead to the misdiagnosis of the disease caused by WENVs or other mammarenaviruses. The ELISA test for WENV antibodies will reduce the likelihood of misdiagnosis, though the results need to be further verified by virus neutralization assay.",

In addition to the liver, these viruses were also detected in the heart, spleen, lung, kidney, and intestine and may increase the spillover potential of some viral strains. Deep borderline, many remote areas, and abundant animal sources increase the burden to discover and control zoonotic diseases in Yunnan Province.
