These data indicate that bleeding in general, or contamination of samples with blood-derived cells, was not confounding our gene expression assessments. We next assessed the expression of selected lymphocyte and other immune cell markers. Most of these genes (e.g., CD3/8/19, MPO) were expressed at low levels in most subjects. However, the expression of some (e.g., CD4) were reliably detected in many or most subjects, albeit at a relatively low level. Finally, we assessed the expression of a set of immune cell marker genes7. These data suggested the presence of a low level of immune cells, primarily granulocytes, mast cells and macrophages (Fig. 3). However, it is clear that some subjects displayed higher levels of expression for leukocyte markers than others.",

This resulted in a set of 7,081 genes whose expression we propose defines the healthy infant nasal transcriptome (HINT). We compared the HINT to the nasal transcriptome previously reported for non-asthmatic control teenage subjects4. There was a high degree of similarity between these two transcriptomes (Fig. 4A), with the older subjects displaying more diversity than the infants. Since we believe that interrogation of the nasal transcriptome may provide insight into homeostatic and disease processes occurring in the lung proper, we compared the HINT to previously published data sets describing gene expression in the pulmonary upper9 or lower10 airways. Among the 7,081 expressed genes defining the HINT, 5840 (82%) were expressed in all samples, while 86% were expressed in \u201cteenage\u201d nasal airway, and 88% were consistently expressed in the adult (both upper and lower) airway.",

The presence of one of these known pathogens was the variable most profoundly associated with differences in HINT gene expression (Table 2). For instance, many genes displayed significant changes in expression variance associated with the presence of either bacteria (n = 16 genes) or virus (n = 123 genes). Notably, the mean expression of 130 genes was significantly different in subjects with a pathogen when compared to subjects where these pathogens were undetectable. Interestingly, these gene expression changes were more highly associated with the presence of viral pathogens (9 subjects, 282 genes) than bacterial pathogens (12 subjects, 1 gene). Pathway analysis indicated that genes associated with the presence of viral pathogens were involved in tight junction, PI3K/AKT, apoptosis, CD27, lymphotoxin B receptor and GADD45 signaling pathways, as well as DNA double-strand break repair (Supplemental Fig. 3).",

To explore this issue further, we comprehensively assessed the relationship between the HINT and the presence of all colonizing bacteria in the nasal turbinates. The abundance of various taxonomical units representing pathogenic species, and their related genera, was quantified by 16S ribosomal sequencing, and correlated with nasal gene expression patterns (Fig. 5). While gene expression patterns were generally not significantly associated with the abundance of Streptococcus (1 gene) or Haemophilus (0 genes), the expression of 1927 genes was significantly associated with the abundance of any Moraxellaceae family. Moreover, the abundance of the pathogenic genus of Moraxella was almost solely associated with nasal gene expression (739 genes), while other non-pathogenic genera were almost never associated with nasal gene expression. Pathway analysis indicated that Moraxella responsive genes were involved in axonal guidance, A- and B- adrenergic, sphongosine\u22121-phosphate, IL1, CCR5 and IL17F signaling, retinol biosynthesis, regulation of cytokine production and DNA double-strand break repair (Supplemental Fig. 4).",

Although we were able to recover RNA from a vast majority of the subjects using our detailed protocol (see Supplement), we saw significant variability in yield across subjects. Therefore, we chose to use a commercially available \u201clow input\u201d protocol for RNA sequencing, which enabled capture of data from all subjects. Although it is likely that this approach sacrifices sensitivity for detection of genes expressed at a low level, we did observe very high technical replicate correlation. We also noted sample-wide correlations which were consistent, but somewhat lower than expected (r = 0.730 \u00b1 0.148). We believe this reflects the heterogeneity of individual samples, which are likely representative of multiple (epithelial, as well as some non-epithelial) cell types. Unfortunately, in the current study, we were unable to use cytometry to directly assess the diversity of cells within individual subjects, or among subjects across the cohort. However, sample composition was partially assessed using cell-specific marker gene expression. High levels of nasal-specific and general epithelial cell marker expression were identified. These data also suggested a low level (but not absence) of immune/inflammatory cells, which may be greater without washing of the nares prior to cell recovery. In addition, the consistently absent or low detection of globin transcripts indicated no significant injury from the procedure as well as little or no red blood cell confounding of expression data. These results strongly suggest that this method predominantly assesses nasal epithelial cell gene expression. It is also worth noting that we found differences in sample recovery efficiency based upon the swab used for brushing the nasal turbinates. After some trial and error, and consideration of the relationship between aggressive cell recovery and injury to the subjects, we were successful in consistently recovering sufficient RNA for complete transcriptome analysis and expression validation. Alternate brush choices, allowing more aggressive brushing, may be better for older subjects. Finally, our recovery procedures were affected by apparent changes in buoyancy of cells stored in RNA stabilizer. In order to overcome some observed variability in centrifugation-based cell recovery of cells suspended in RNA stabilizer, we ensured 100% recovery by simple centrifugation through a membrane. To overcome potential technical impediments, we strongly recommend following the specific protocol provided, particularly the choice of swab.",

Conversely, the data indicate relatively low levels of expression for most leukocyte markers including lymphocyte genes (CD3/8/19/56), neutrophil genes (MPO) and generic hematopoietic genes (CD34). (B) We further assessed the expression of a subset of genes used to define leukocyte subtypes.
