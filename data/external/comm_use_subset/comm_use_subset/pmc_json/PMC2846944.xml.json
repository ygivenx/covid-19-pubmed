The first case was identified on 16 November 2002 in the southern Chinese city of Foshan [2]. The epidemic then spread within Guangdong province before a large superspreading event in Hong Kong seeded the global outbreak [3]. On 5 July 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the last affected area Taiwan to be transmission free and declared the last human-to-human transmission chain successfully interrupted [4]. Hong Kong, mainland China and Taiwan carried the largest disease burden as well as marked the most important milestones of the global outbreak. However, due to geo-political factors beyond the remit of public health, a consolidated account of their collective experience has not previously been documented.",

However, the re-emergence of SARS remains a distinct possibility given that similar viruses continue to be isolated in potential animal reservoirs including bats [8,9] and palm civets [10], and trading of the latter continues in Guangdong province despite its official ban [11]. Moreover, reemergence in humans could result from an unknown animal reservoir, or via an intermediary animal host. In addition, among the three affected regions in Greater China, the disease had apparently different epidemiological characteristics whereas the populations share the same gene pool and the same viral clade [12]. These apparent epidemiologic heterogeneities despite similar host and viral genotypes as well as the preparedness imperative for a possible return of SARS motivated the present comparative analysis of the three regions, based on an integrated database of 3336 probable cases, which is the largest single repository of SARS patients constructed to date. We present comprehensive estimates of epidemiologic parameters of interest, and we also investigate potential explanations for the observed discrepancies between regions.",

Clinical information was reviewed by a panel of experts in the earlier stage of the epidemics and furthermore a standardized report form was used after May as previously described [15]. Data were extracted by detailed chart review in each hospital following a standard protocol. Hospital 309 admitted many of the earliest SARS patients and reached full capacity by early April. SARS patients were then sent to Hospital 302, a hospital specializing in infectious diseases. The severity and infectiousness of SARS prompted the Beijing government to build the XTS Hospital in eight days, opening on 1 May 2003. Data on comorbidities, and symptoms were unavailable for patients in Hospital 309.",

We estimated the case fatality ratios (CFRs) within subgroups of each of these characteristics. We calculated the age- and sex-standardized CFRs and associated exact binomial 95% confidence intervals based on the World Standard Population [16]. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models, controlled for variables such as sex, age, health care worker status, preexisting comorbid conditions and nosocomial infection, for each region on all data allowing us to estimate the adjusted odds ratios of mortality between regions. In the regression models we excluded all 126 patients from Hospital 309 for whom data on pre-existing comorbid conditions were not available and also other two, one and five patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan respectively with unknown age, pre-existing comorbid conditions, onset date or admission date. To avoid extreme values in the adjusted odds ratio for the age effect, we chose the middle age group as the reference group. For Hong Kong patients, we also tested the effect of residence in Amoy Garden where a severe outbreak occurred in which many patients presented with diarrhea [17].",

The epidemic in Hong Kong occurred mainly in late March and early April 2003, preceding the outbreaks in Beijing and Taiwan by approximately one month. Figure 2B, C and 2D show box plots of the time from onset to admission during different calendar time periods and the overall distributions of onset-to-admission intervals. Within each region, the onset-to-admission times decreased throughout the main part of all three epidemics, while onset-to-admission times appeared to increase towards the end of the Hong Kong epidemic. Excluding the patients admitted before symptom onset, the mean delay from onset to admission were 3.6, 2.7 and 2.8 days respectively for Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan. A relatively large proportion of patients were admitted to hospital within one day after symptom onset in both Beijing and Taiwan, and Taiwan had a higher proportion of patients admitted before symptom onset. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, patients admitted before symptom onset had a much higher CFR (53% and 70% respectively, see Additional files 3 and 4). Hong Kong and Taiwan showed a decreasing gradient with prolonged delay from first symptoms to hospitalization until about one week whereas the opposite appeared to be the case in Beijing. Within Beijing, there was a clear difference in both onset-to-admission distributions and CFRs among hospitals although the trends were mostly consistent (see Additional file 4).",

Our combined database is unique in that of the three regions, only mainland China is a member of the WHO whereas Hong Kong is an observer and Taiwan is a non-member. Such geo-political influences have posed an almost insurmountable challenge to official supranational agencies in pulling together the respective databases [20]. Database construction during an outbreak is critical to underpin analyses that will inform policy decisions regarding both disease control and treatment of infected patients. Key to the utility of such databases is their scope, format, accuracy and timeliness. While we have largely succeeded on the first two counts, the fact that we are only reporting results seven years after SARS receded into its animal reservoir points to an urgent deficiency in the global public health research infrastructure. Nevertheless, this report underscores the positive steps forward in recent years.",

However, discounting the highly selected XTS Hospital sample, the Beijing CFR approximated that of Hong Kong. On the other hand, Taiwan had a 64% higher adjusted case fatality compared to Hong Kong. Clearly one of the most important explanations for the observed low case fatality ratio in our subset of patients from Beijing is the inherent selection bias. While we studied 36% of the reported probable SARS cases in Beijing, from three of the largest SARS hospitals, our subset is by no means representative. The majority (74%) of our patients were from the XTS Hospital, a facility which was built especially to house SARS patients and opened halfway through the epidemic. Only one of the 680 inpatients was directly admitted, the remainder were transferred from other hospitals in Beijing. Although some of the XTS patients experienced symptom onset as early as the end of March, admission to XTS would have required survival until at least May 1, when XTS opened. Further, it is less likely that patients in serious condition (for example requiring mechanical ventilation) would have been transferred. As further confirmation of the systematic selection of the XTS sample, we found that patients admitted to XTS Hospital were epidemiologically biased, as shown by having shorter onset-to-admission periods and longer onset-to-discharge periods (data not shown).",

However, the treatment of choice in Hong Kong and Taiwan was the combined use of ribavirin and corticosteroids [14,23], and a large meta-analysis has shown that these treatments were likely ineffective [24]. We also observed similar patterns of CFRs for patients with the four most common comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive airways disease; data not shown) between Hong Kong and Taiwan and we did not observe exceptionally high case-fatality ratios among the patients with comorbidities in Taiwan. Hence the difference is probably not attributable to anti-viral or immunologic regimens but could have been related to different levels of general supportive care. Overall, our analysis found that age and pre-existing comorbid conditions were two major determinants of fatality, which is consistent with existing studies [14,25-30]. Male sex was significantly associated with increased risk of fatality in Hong Kong after adjustment for other important confounding factors, consistent with a previous study in Hong Kong that identified a sex effect in unadjusted analyses of aggregate data [31]. The reasons for an increase in risk of death among males remain unclear. In addition we found that admission before symptom onset, most likely due to nosocomial acquisition, was also significantly associated with higher fatality rate after adjustment for comorbidities in Taiwan [32].",

Together they can reliably inform the diagnostician the likelihood of SARS in a suspected case and advise the public health practitioner the appropriate period of quarantine. While most countries used a ten-day quarantine period, based on early estimates of the incubation period [33], our findings suggest that a longer period may be appropriate if SARS were to reemerge [29]. However differences between regions in the incubation distribution, as well as in the onset to discharge/death distributions discussed below, may be due to different interpretations of disease onset between the regions.",

This again points to the need for a universal information supply chain, from case and symptom definitions to guidelines in history taking and data coding, for newly emerging or resurging diseases of supranational interest. As previously noted all three areas analyzed here shared the identical viral strain, as well as the same ethnic gene pool, so it is less likely that differences are due to the infective agent or host genetic factors. Although there are differences in the absolute rates of the various symptoms, we note that a previously derived clinical prediction rule for SARS [39] has been validated on patients from Taiwan [40].",

            "text": "Finally, a few limitations bear mention. As in most previous studies [14,29,41,42], our analysis was based on probable cases of SARS according to the WHO definition [13] rather than laboratory confirmed cases because the latter definition may be biased toward including more survivors, particularly among the earlier cases [14]. Furthermore, rapid diagnostic SARS tests were not available until fairly late in the epidemic and had poor sensitivity for detecting the disease [43,44]. The WHO case definitions may have been applied differently in the three regions, or a different percentage of probable cases might have been caused by other pathogens, which may have led to the observed differences. Furthermore, while SARS patients in Beijing were classified according to the WHO definition, but a more recent detailed case review has found that some reported 'probable' SARS cases may have been misclassified [45]. We note that odds ratios should be interpreted with caution since they may be a poor approximation to relative risks with outcomes that have a high prevalence. Asymptomatic and subclinical infections of SARS were not considered in our analysis, although there is strong evidence that very few existed [46]. A final limitation is that, as previously discussed, the Beijing patients in our database mostly were hospitalized in XTS Hospital and were found to be epidemiologically different from patients in other hospitals, which makes it difficult to generalize our results to all patients in Beijing.",
