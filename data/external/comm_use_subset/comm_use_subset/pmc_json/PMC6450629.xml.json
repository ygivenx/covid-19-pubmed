Endemic, emerging, and re-emerging respiratory diseases may threaten both local and global populations, as has been highlighted with the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [1], followed by outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 [2]. Among the 5,942 million deaths in children under 5 in 2015, 15.5% were due to pneumonia [3]. Southeast Asia is thought to play a particularly important role in the global circulation of respiratory pathogens such as seasonal influenza A/H3N2 [4\u20136]. However, epidemiological surveillance of respiratory pathogens in Southeast Asia has been limited compared with the western hemisphere [7]. Furthermore, the socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors that influence disease burden and transmission dynamics can vary substantially both within and between hemispheres [7,8]. Thus, characterizing local epidemiology and burden of respiratory pathogens is crucial for appropriate public health decisions.",

The pentavalent vaccine including Hemophilus influenzae type B is included in the NIP since 2009 [13]. With the assistance of Gavi, the country introduced the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine PCV13 into its NIP in October 2013. The schedule was for PCV13 vaccination to be given to infants at 6, 10, 14 weeks. The results of two cross-sectional community carriage surveys pre- and two years post-PCV13 introduction showed a significant 23% reduction in carriage prevalence of PCV13-related strains in 12\u201323-month-old children [14]. The prevalence of carriage of PCV13 strains was also lower in 5-8-week-old infants, suggesting evidence of herd immunity in this age group [14]. Japanese encephalitis vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine were introduced in 2015; and a second dose of measles-rubella vaccine targeting children 12\u201318 months in 2017 [13]. Despite a clear increase in NIP vaccines, pockets of suboptimal vaccination delivery and utilization persist, mostly in ethnic minority groups and remote rural areas [13]. A seasonal influenza vaccination program with trivalent inactivated was launched in 2012 for high-risk adults including pregnant women [15].",

Households were selected from household registries and were enrolled into the cohort via door-to-door sampling. A household was defined as a group of individuals living on the same plot of land (one or more houses) or in the same building (apartment) and sharing their meals.

However, the clinical significance of the bacteria was frequently difficult to establish. Co-detection was identified in 24.1% of ILI cases, with influenza (A and B) and Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common combination. Recently, new evidence has emerged regarding an interaction between these two pathogens. Some authors believe that influenza induces susceptibility to secondary pneumococcal infections while others reject the unidirectional effect of the virus on Streptococcus pneumoniae by arguing that asymptomatic pneumococcal carriage may be an indicator of subsequent influenza virus infection ([38] and references therein). It is also important to note that we did not detect a statistically significant association between Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza; thus, the relatively high frequency of these co-infections does not necessarily support hypotheses for influenza-induced susceptibility to pneumococcal infection (or vice versa). We did, however, observe a significant association between Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae infection. A synergistic association between these agents has previously been observed in children [39], and also in an experimental study on Chinchillas [40], with the latter suggesting that H. influenzae co-infection promotes pneumococcal biofilm formation and persistence.",

These potential pathogens are also carried by healthy individuals as commensals with varied rates according to the age. The highest rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage are in general seen at 6 months to 3 years of age [51,52] and an inverse relationship has previously been observed between the carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus [53\u201355]. This finding together with the fact that nasal carriage of these pathogens is known to be the first step of infection [56, 57] could explain the observed differences in the rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus detection in these age groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the principal bacterial pathogen in recent studies of pneumonia in children in Nepal [58], in India [59] and in the WHO Western Pacific region [60].",

Furthermore, in the 14 potential household transmission events identified, the \u201cindex\u201d cases (based on date of symptom onset) were children in less than half of the clusters. These findings are consistent with those of the aforementioned household cohort study in Vietnam, which similarly found little evidence to suggest that children are the main contributors to household transmission [34]. In slight contrast to the Vietnam study, however, we observed household clusters to be most frequently associated with influenza rather than rhinovirus.",

For example, this approach relies on households to report ILI symptoms when contacted by the surveillance team, and reporting rates may vary by age and severity of symptoms. Some asymptomatic or mild cases are likely to be missed, and specimen sampling will not always coincide with the optimum time window for pathogen detection. In addition, self-reported date of symptom onset may not be an accurate proxy for identifying primary and secondary cases within household clusters. Longitudinal serological surveys are needed to more accurately infer household transmission risk, although this requires considerable additional resources and to date such serological surveys have tended to focus on a single pathogen such as influenza [64]. Hemophilus influenzae is among the leading bacterial causes of respiratory infection. Except Hemophilus influenza B, our study did not include other serotypable Hemophilus influenza strains due to limited available funds. Nasal samples are however stored in a biobank and will be the subject of further analyses.",
