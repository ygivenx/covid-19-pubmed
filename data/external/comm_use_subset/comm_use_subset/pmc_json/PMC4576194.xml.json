CSFV is a small enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 12.3 kb. The RNA genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) coding for a polyprotein, flanked by a 5\u02b9-untranslated region (UTR) and a 3\u02b9-UTR. Under cellular and viral protease processing, the polyprotein is processed into 11 mature proteins, including four structural proteins (C, Erns, E1 and E2) and seven nonstructural proteins (Npro, p7, NS2-3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) [1,2,3]. The 5\u02b9-UTR contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that is responsible for translation initiation of the viral genome [4]. The 3\u02b9-UTR is in charge of regulating the pestiviral genome replication [5,6].",

The conserved sequence C2717\u2013C2740\u2013C2742\u2013C2767 in the NS5A protein has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [7]. It has been shown that NS5A regulates viral RNA replication through binding to NS5B (viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) and 3\u02b9-UTR [8]. The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV), another member of the family Flaviviridae, is an essential component of the replication complex [9] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [10,11]. The HCV NS5A\u2013Core interaction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS5A and the production of infectious virus [12]. The HCV NS5A also plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [13,14]. In addition, the CSFV NS5A decreases IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner and the key sites (K399, T401, E406 and L413) are also found in BVDV, BDV and HCV [15]. To date, studies have been focused on the roles of the CSFV NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [8,15], but knowledge of NS5A-interacting host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited.",

For TBSV, eEF1A facilitates the assembly of the TBSV replicase and stimulates minus-strand synthesis [21]. The HIV-1 Nef protein enhances the resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in primary human macrophages through the nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic transport of eEF1A and tRNAs. Moreover, eEF1 complex subunits are critical HIV-1 reverse transcription cofactors [22,23]. In addition, the BVDV NS5A was also shown to interact with eEF1A [24]. Considering CSFV, BVDV, HCV and WNV are all Flaviviridae members, we suppose that the CSFV NS5A protein possibly interacts with eEF1A or affects the CSFV growth in host cells. In this study, we identified the host protein eEF1A as a novel NS5A-interacting partner that negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.",

To confirm the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay was performed with the GST-tagged NS5A protein expressed in Escherichia coli and the Myc-tagged eEF1A protein expressed in HEK293T cells. The results showed that GST-NS5A but not GST interacts with eEF1A (Figure 1B). To further verify the interaction between NS5A and eEF1A, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed with HEK293T cells overexpressing 3\u00d7Flag-tagged NS5A and Myc-tagged eEF1A. After incubation with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (MAb) and Protein G-Agarose, the Myc-tagged eEF1A was found to coprecipitate with the 3\u00d7Flag-tagged NS5A (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the 3\u00d7Flag-tagged NS5A was shown to coprecipitate with Myc-eEF1A when the cell lysate was incubated with anti-Myc MAb and Protein G-Agarose (Figure 1D). Considering that both eEF1A and NS5A show a strong affinity for nucleic acids, we investigated whether the NS5A\u2013eEF1A interaction might be mediated through a nonspecific RNA bridge. The results showed that the NS5A\u2013eEF1A interaction was not influenced by RNase treatment, indicating that the interaction is not due to nonspecific RNA-mediated binding (Figure 1E). To examine the colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A, the subcellular localization of 3\u00d7Flag-NS5A and Myc-eEF1A was examined by confocal microscopy.

A previous study showed that the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins were screened using Y2H analysis, and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription, protein degradation, protein folding and metabolism [26]. Recently, heat shock protein 70 has been identified to interact with the CSFV NS5A and enhance viral RNA replication [27]. In this study, eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication. eEF1A had not been identified in the previous study, probably due to the different cell types (endothelial cells vs. primary macrophages) used to construct the cDNA library [26].

The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A [28]. eEF1A also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and regulates the virus replication [29]. Furthermore, eEF1A can be utilized as the cofactors of the viral RNA synthesis for several viruses, such as HIV-1 [22,23], TBSV [21] and WNV [30]. Previous studies on turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and TBSV have shown that eEF1A interacts primarily with the viral RdRp complex, and thus acts as a chaperone and supports viral replication [31,32,33]. As members of Flaviviridae, both BVDV NS5A and HCV NS4A interact with eEF1A [24,34]. Thereinto, the exact role of eEF1A on the BVDV replication remains unclear [24]. The HCV NS4A inhibits the viral IRES-mediated translation, and the translation inhibitory effect of NS4A was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in the in vitro translation system [34]. However, we showed here that eEF1A negatively regulates the CSFV growth. We conclude that the different roles of eEF1A in viral replication may vary depending on the distinct interactions between eEF1A and different viruses. In this study, the eEF1A was shown to bind to the IRES and inhibit its activity, thus it is possible to suppress the CSFV replication.",

It has been shown that interaction between eEF1A and the 3\u02b9-terminal stem-loop of the WNV genomic RNA facilitates the viral minus-strand RNA synthesis [30,36,37]. In the present study, we demonstrated that eEF1A binds to IRES located in the 5\u02b9-UTR of CSFV. Whether eEF1A binds to 3\u02b9-UTR of CSFV and influences RNA replication requires further study. We showed that eEF1A inhibits CSFV growth and reduces IRES activity of CSFV. Thus, we speculate that eEF1A affects the process of the viral protein translation via interacting with the CSFV IRES.",

Yeast Y2HGold strain was cotransformed with pGBKT7-NS5A (BD-NS5A) as a bait and pGADT7-eEF1A (AD-eEF1A) as a prey. As a positive control, pGBKT7-p53 (BD-p53) and pGADT7-T (AD-T) were cotransformed into Y2HGold strain. Cotransformation of pGBKT7-Lamin C (BD-Lamin C) and AD-T was used as a negative control. All the yeast colonies cotransformed with the above plasmids were grown on synthetically defined (SD) medium lacking His and Leu (SD/-2), SD medium lacking His, Leu, Trp and Ade (SD/-4) and SD/-4 medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b1-D-galactopyranoside (X-\u03b1-Gal) and aureobasidin A (Aba) (SD/-4/X-\u03b1-Gal/Aba); (B) Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. The GST or GST-NS5A fusion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were purified with glutathione Sepharose 4B resin and incubated with the lysate of HEK293T cells overexpressing the Myc-tagged eEF1A. After washing with cold PBS, the bound proteins were subjected to sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (10%) and Western blotting using the anti-GST polyclonal antibody (PAb) (1:2000) and the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (C) Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of Myc-tagged eEF1A and Flag-tagged NS5A. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids (+) or empty vectors (-) for 48 h. The transfected cells were lyzed and incubated with a mouse anti-Flag MAb, followed by incubation with the Protein G-Agarose for 6 h at 4 \u00b0C.

HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the indicated plasmids (+) or empty vectors (\u2212), the cell lysate was collected at 48 h post-transfection (hpt), incubated with the anti-Myc MAb and Protein G-Agarose. The immunoprecipitate was examined by Western blotting using the anti-Flag MAb (1:1000) and the anti-Myc PAb (1:500); (E) Effects of RNase A/T1 treatment on the NS5A\u2013eEF1A interaction. Extracts of HEK293T cells overexpressing different proteins were treated or untreated with RNase A/T1 for 1 h prior to Co-IP and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The total RNA in the immunoprecipitate was visualized by ethidium bromide-staining; (F) Colocalization of NS5A protein with eEF1A. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with p3\u00d7Flag-NS5A and pMyc-eEF1A. Cells were fixed at 48 hpt and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect 3\u00d7Flag-NS5A (green) and Myc-eEF1A (red) with mouse anti-Flag and rabbit anti-Myc antibodies.
