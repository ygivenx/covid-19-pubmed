The main reason for admission to ICU is a pulmonary inflammatory syndrome characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (acute respiratory distress syndrome: ARDS), which can be fatal. Since the beginning of 2009 pandemic, international health authorities recommended monitoring severe and complicated cases of influenza infection [3, 4]. Considering the serious outcome of these respiratory diseases, the contribution of other respiratory pathogens besides A(H1N1)pdm09 should be envisaged [5]. Additionally, in clinical practice, a specific causative agent which explains the respiratory symptoms is often unidentified, owing to the lack of sensitive tests or the presence of an as-yet unknown pathogen. The recently developed VIDISCA-454 (VIrus DIScovery using CDNA Amplified fragment-length polymorphism combined with Roche-454 high-throughput sequencing) is a sensitive sequence-independent virus discovery technique which can be used to reveal as-yet unknown viruses [5, 6].",

Data on comorbidities presence were available for nearly 70% of study patients: 64.3% reported medical conditions [3, 4]; in detail, 25.6% had weakened immune system (due to cancer, HIV/AIDS, or long-term steroid treatment), 19.7% heart disease, 11.6% asthma/chronic lung disease, and 10.4% neurological/neurodevelopmental conditions. Out of 206 patients, 91 (59.3% males; 18.7% aged \u2264 5 years, 58.2% aged 6\u201364 years) were SARI cases who required admission to ICU and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, and 115 (62.6% males; 16.5% aged \u22645 years, 60% aged 6\u201364 years) were ARDS cases, as defined by the European Consensus Conference [8]. Nine ARDS patients (median age: 35.6 years, IQR: 21.4 years) died during hospitalization: case fatality rate (CFR) in our ARDS series was 7.8% (9/115). No SARI case was fatal.",

Four (4/7: 57.1%) of these individuals belonged to risk categories (i.e., two were cancer patients, one was morbidly obese, and one had underlying neurodevelopmental conditions).

More than half (51.7%) of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection resulted in ARDS. It is interesting to note that most (67.5%) severe respiratory diseases due to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were identified among 6\u201364-year-old individuals. The A(H1N1)pdm09 case fatality rate in our ARDS series was 11.3% fatal cases in young adults, and 42.8% did not belong to any at-risk category [3, 4]. This data is in agreement with other studies; Van Kerkhove et al. have reported a median age of 46 years among fatal laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 cases [12]. McCallum has described that during the 2009 pandemic only 1% of laboratory-confirmed cases and 13% of laboratory-confirmed deaths were among persons 65 years of age or older [13]. The Global Pandemic Mortality (GLaMOR) project has evaluated that although the pandemic mortality estimate was similar in magnitude to that of seasonal influenza, a marked shift toward mortality among persons 65 years of age occurred, so that many more life-years were lost [14]. Such an age shift has been documented as well by several studies on A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality [15\u201317].",

In addition, it is noteworthy that VIDISCA-454 enabled the identification of one measles infection that escaped clinical diagnosis in one SARI case. Hence, measles infection should be considered in complicated pulmonary disease, as also suggested by others [26], since measles virus is not generally included in respiratory diagnostic panels.",
