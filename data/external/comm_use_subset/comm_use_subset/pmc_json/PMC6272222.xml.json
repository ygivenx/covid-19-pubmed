            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification, developed and reported by Notomi et al., in 2000 [1], can specifically, sensitively and rapidly amplify nucleic acids with two pairs of primers recognizing 6 independent sequences of a target gene under isothermal conditions. Moreover, Nagamine et al., has advanced the method by putting forward loop primers that accelerate the LAMP reaction [2]. Therefore, the LAMP assay theoretically has the advantage of specificity, selectivity, and rapidity over polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3,4], nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) [5,6], strand displacement amplification (SDA) [7], rolling circle amplification (RCA) [8], helicase dependent amplification (HDA) [9], and cross-priming amplification assay (CPA) [10,11]. For practical application of LAMP as well as reduction of the rate of false positive results in LAMP reactions, most researches currently focus on development of closed-tube detection to reduce aerosol pollution and cross pollution, which include the use of turbidity [12], SYBR Green I [13], PicoGreen [14], GelRedTM [15,16], lateral flow dipstick [17], hydroxynaphthol blue dye [18], malachite green [19], microfluidic chips and GMR sensors as well as calcein used by Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd [20,21]. However, there is still no report studying non-specific amplification and cause of false positive results in LAMP reactions at present.",

Analysis on the three combinations indicated that they had the common situation that 3\u20134 bases at 3' end of both primers had two complementary sequences on a same primer, and such situation had been avoided when LAMP primers for prfA of L. monocytogenes were designed and screened in this study. Moreover, it was proved by the experiment that non-specific amplification caused by primer dimers was one reason for false positive results of LAMP.",

When 5% DMSO was added, the detection time for 1 pg L. monocytogenes genomic DNA was less than 25 min; however, one of the two negative controls amplified as well. The Tm value and melt curve were obviously different from those of the positive controls, and were therefore as attributed to non-specific amplification, which may be caused by partial complementation among primers of LAMP. The detection time with 10% DMSO was slightly longer than with 7.5%. Overall, the results showed that the lower concentration of DMSO does not inhibit non-specific amplification while the higher concentration of DMSO may inhibit the activity of Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerase, and therefore, 7.5% DMSO was determined to be the optimal among these three concentrations.",

This is especially true when the concentrations of primers, Mg2+, dNTPs and DNA Polymerase in reaction mixtures are as high as those used in Real-time PCR. The concentrations of these 4 factors must be strictly controlled to avoid non-specific amplification in real-time PCR [24] as well as LAMP reactions. There are instances in which standard PCR amplification reaction conditions do not produce acceptable results. Addition of DMSO and use of Touchdown temperature conditions have been used improve PCR results. We investigate these approaches for the first time for optimization of LAMP reactions. Unfortunately, with the information presently available it is not possible to predict which enhancing agent is best for any particular target. But DMSO has been frequently used in this capacity [25]. The results presented here using DMSO in LAMP reaction mixtures indicate that, DMSO can increase amplification with LAMP at low concentration and can inhibit activity of Bst 2.0 WarmStart DNA polymerase. We had tried to enhance the reaction of LAMP with betaine, Tetramethylammonium chloride, tetramethylene sulfoxide, and formamide, but their effect was not as good as that of DMSO, because of the limitation of length, no more tautology here. While DMSO may not necessarily be the best enhancing agent [26,27], i.e., the manufacturer of the commercial Isothermal Amplification Kit used in this experiment may have found some favorable enhancing agent, but their reagents are proprietary, and DMSO served to decrease non-specific amplification in the specific experiments presented here.",

This improvement may be due to the high temperature inhibiting the formation of primer dimers and promoting the correct combination of primers and template. The biggest advantage of LAMP is that the reaction can be performed isothermally, and people argue all the time that all we need is a simple water bath for the rapid detection, so the advantage may be compromised by the developed Touchdown LAMP assay, we made such efforts here just to reveal or verify the main cause for false positive results of LAMP and inspire people to modify and improve LAMP technology, my colleagues and I have also been looking for a more suitable method, which can not only keep the advantage but also improve the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP.",
