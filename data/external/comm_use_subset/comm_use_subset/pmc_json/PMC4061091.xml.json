            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. It has been found worldwide since its first report among poultry in the areas of Java, Indonesia, and England in 1926. This virus has an extensive range of susceptible hosts, with 27 of the 50 orders of birds reported to be capable of infection by NDV [1], making Newcastle disease (ND) a global animal health concern. Although the vaccination of chickens is performed throughout the world, this disease still remains endemic in poultry in many regions. According to the severity of disease in chickens, isolates of NDV can be categorized into three pathotypes: the lentogenic (avirulent), mesogenic (intermediate virulence), and velogenic (highly virulent) strains. Infections with velogenic strains have had devastating effects on the poultry industry due to the high rates of morbidity and mortality. Thus, virulent NDV isolates are notifiable to the Office of International Epizootes (OIE) with obligatory control measures upon the occurrence of outbreaks of the disease.",

            "text": "The genome of NDV is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA and encodes six viral proteins from six genes: nucleocapsid (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) proteins [2]. Two additional proteins, V and W, are produced by RNA editing during P gene transcription [3]. HN and F are membrane proteins of NDV that are responsible for mediating NDV infection. While HN mediates viral attachment to the sialic acid receptors on the cells, F protein directs membrane fusion between the virus and cells [4], [5]. Antibodies against HN and F have shown the ability to block the receptor binding and virus-cell fusion, respectively, thereby protecting birds from virulent NDV infection [6]\u2013[11]. The elicitation of neutralizing antibodies is therefore considered a high priority of vaccine design. Moreover, having effective assays that evaluate these neutralizing antibodies are necessary for assessing viral infection and vaccine efficacy. At present, the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and the virus-neutralization (VN) assays are available for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against NDV [12]\u2013[16]. While the HI assay is able to measure only the neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding site and has limitations in terms of its low sensitivity and high incidence of false-positives [17]\u2013[19], the conventionally used VN assay is labor-intensive, time-consuming (requiring a minimum of 4 days), and less objective [15], making it unsuitable for large scale evaluation of neutralizing antibodies. Pseudovirus-based neutralization assays, however, have been proven to be a rapid, sensitive, and specific high-throughput system for the evaluation of neutralizing antibodies and antiviral drug discovery. The pseudovirus backbone (commonly a lentiviral or retroviral vector) generally carries a reporter gene, such as luciferase, in which the neutralizing ability of antibodies can be easily quantified. Pseudotyped viral particles by heterologous viral glycoproteins have been described for several viruses, including influenza virus [20], [21], SARS coronavirus [22], Sendai virus [23] and hepatitis C virus [24]. However, pseudotyped viruses with the NDV envelope glycoproteins HN and F have not yet been reported. Here, we report on the successful production of HN and F-pseudotyped (NDV-pseudotyped) HIV-Luc viral particles and the factors impacting the infection efficiency of NDV-pseudoviruses. We further established a novel neutralization assay with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against NDV.",

As shown in figure 2C, luciferase activity in the cells infected with NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses reached more than 40000 RLU, much higher than in the control (P<0.01), indicating the successful production of an infectious NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus.",

We hypothesized that this may be due to the impact of the cytoplasmic domain of the envelope proteins [33], [34]. To address this, four plasmids containing mutant HN or F were constructed (Figure 1A and B). After confirming their expression on 293 T cells (Figure 1C), nine combinations of wild-type and mutant HN and F were co-transfected into 293 T cells with HIV-Luc vector to produce corresponding pseudotyped viruses. As shown in figure 3, of the nine combinations, six produce infectious pseudotyped viruses including HN plus F, HN plus F\u0394CT, HN plus F/VCT, VCT/HN plus F, VCT/HN plus F\u0394CT and VCT/HN plus F/VCT. Among the infectious pseudotyped viruses, the infection efficiencies of VCT/HN plus F and VCT/HN plus F/VCT were the highest, reaching from 8 to 50 folds higher than all other groups (P<0.01). The infection efficiency between the two combinations was not significantly different (P>0.05). This indicated that replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of HN by VCT greatly enhanced the infection efficiency of NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. However, fusion of VCT to the N-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of HN resulted in the complete loss of infectivity as shown in the combinations of VCT-HN plus F, VCT-HN plus F\u0394CT and VCT-HN plus F/VCT (Figure 3). These results revealed the important role of the cytoplasmic domain of HN on the infection efficiency of NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Moreover, when we compared VCT/HN plus F\u0394CT with the combinations of VCT/HN plus F and VCT/HN plus F/VCT, we saw a significant reduction in the infection efficiency with the pseudotyped virus containing F\u0394CT (P<0.01). This result revealed that the cytoplasmic domain of F also plays an important role in the infection efficiency of NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. This was further confirmed by comparison among the combinations of HN plus F, HN plus F\u0394CT and HN plus F/VCT, where both the deletion and VCT replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of F significantly reduced infectivity (P<0.01) (Figure 3). Altogether, these results indicated that the cytoplasmic domain of HN was the dominant factor behind the infection efficiency of the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus, and VCT/HN plus F or F/VCT is the optimal recombination for the production of highly infectious pseudoviruses.",

Many pseudotyped vectors have been developed using retroviruses or lentiviruses, such as the Mo-MuLV vector from Moloney murine leukemia virus and HIV-1 vector from the HIV-1 virus [36], [37]. Given that some components essential for viral replication or persistent infection have been deleted from the genome, pseudotyped viruses can only take on a single-cycle of infection. Thus, they are a safe alternative for use in the research lab with extremely virulent viruses. So far, pseudoviruses have been used for the identification of virus receptors, screening and evaluation of neutralizing antibodies, transduction of genes to target cells and exploration of the mechanisms of virus infection [38]\u2013[44]. Previously, envelope proteins of Sendai virus, a member of paramyxovirus, have been reported to successfully pseudotype the lentivirus vector derived from simian immunodeficiency virus [23]. Recently, two other paramyxovirus pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have been successfully reported, establishing the ability of paramyxoviruses to form successful pseudoviruses [45], [46]. Here, we successfully produced pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus particles with the HN and F proteins of NDV (Figure 2C). This is the first report of a NDV-pseudotyped retroviral vector and further adds to the list of paramyxovirus pseudotyped lentivrial vectors.",

            "text": "Previous reports have shown that the interaction between the matrix protein and the cytoplasmic domain of envelope proteins was required for the incorporation of the envelope proteins into mature viral particles [33], [34], [47]. Indeed, we saw a lower infection efficiency with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus compared to the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus (Figure 2C), which we associated with a less-optimal interaction between the HIV-1 matrix and the cytoplasmic domain of NDV envelope proteins. For paramyxoviruses, there are two envelope proteins, HN and F. Given that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of F did not obstruct pseudoviral packaging (Figure 3), we speculated that the interaction between F and matrix protein plays a non-essential role for the packaging of the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus. We suggest that the interaction between F and HN is sufficient for F incorporation into virons [48], [49]. However, although we were able to successfully produce a panel of functional NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses (Figure 3), we found that some would lose their infectivity if not used immediately, such as for the pseudotyped viruses with HN plus F\u0394CT and HN plus F/VCT (data not shown). When the cytoplasmic domain of HN was replaced with a more optimal one (VCT), the stability of the NDV-pseudovirus substantially improved, remaining stable even after repeat thawing. These phenomena perhaps indicate that the interaction between the HIV-1 matrix protein and the cytoplasmic domains of HN and F, especially HN protein, correlates with the stabilization of the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus. Here, we also found that replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of HN with VCT enhanced the infection efficiency and stabilization of the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus, while the infectivity was lost when VCT was added directly to the N-terminus of the HN protein, regardless of which combination of F protein was used (Figure 3). These results differed from those seen in previous research with the Sendai virus where similar replacement and fusion were carried out [23]. These results further suggest that among the paramyxoviruses, their characterizations of packaging lentiviral vectors may differ from each other.",

            "text": "For paramyxoviruses, receptor binding and hemagglutinin-neurominidase active (HA) sites reside in the same region of HN [50]. Therefore, the HI assay is sometimes used for evaluating the neutralizing antibodies that recognize receptor-binging site I [51]. After NDV binding to the receptor on the cells, conformational changes in the envelope proteins will take place [52], [53]. The researches on neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 have shown that numerous antibodies that recognize regions outside of the receptor-binding site are able to neutralize virus infection [54], [55]. For these neutralizing antibodies, the HI assay would be inadequate. More commonly, neutralizing antibodies against NDV are evaluated by VN tests with native NDV [56], [57]. However, the VN test with native NDV is time-consuming, requiring at least 4 days, and less-objective. In this study, we developed a novel assay to evaluate the neutralizing antibodies using the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus (Figure 4 and 5). This assay is capable of evaluating all neutralization activities of antibodies through detection of viral entrance into host cells. Compared to currently available VN tests [58], the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus-based assay only require two days, and is easily performed in large scale with a luminometer. Our results showed that the NT titers determined with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus-based assays were around 4 times higher than those with conventional VN tests (Figure 5A). This reflects on the greater sensitivity for detecting NT titers using our established luciferase-based assay compared with performing microscopic observations of CPE using the VN assay. The sensitivity of the pseudovirus-based assay was further confirmed in the detection of neutralizing antibodies (table 1) in the two negative sera as determined with the conventional VN test. These obvious advantages of being a high-throughput, rapid, sensitive, reproducible and less subjective system have encouraged the development of many other pseudotyped lentivirus for the establishment of neutralization assays, such as equine influenza, Nipah virus, Chikungunya Virus, Coxsackievirus A16 and HIV-1 [25], [26], [45], [59]\u2013[61]. In this novel neutralization assay, there are two methods to titrate NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses, one is by measuring the luciferase activity after pseudovirus infection [60], and the other is with the TCID50 assay. Our results showed that titration by measurement of the luciferase activity is easily performed, however, the value titrated by this method is more variable and less objective compared to that with the TCID50 assay. We prefer the latter method to titrate NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses.",
