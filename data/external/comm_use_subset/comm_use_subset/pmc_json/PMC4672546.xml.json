Bats have evolved apart from other mammals for more than 50 million years [2] and are divided into two major suborders; the Yinpterochiroptera (megachiroptera) and the Yangochiroptera (microchiroptera). Yinpterochiroptera includes the family Pteropodidae and genera Rousettes and Pteropus whereas Yangochiroptera includes the family Myotidae and genus Myotis [3]. Unlike most mammals, bats can fly and this ability enabled their wide geographical range and increased metabolism [2]. Interestingly, bats have recently come to the forefront of zoonotic disease research with vast number of pathogens identified in a wide variety of bat species [2].",

Amongst these are emerging viruses that cause lethal disease in humans and nonhuman primates including Nipah virus [5, 6], Hendra virus [7], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus [8], Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [9], Marburg virus (MARV) [10\u201313], and Ebola virus (EBOV) [14\u201316]. Despite the severe virulence of these viruses in humans, infected bats are often asymptomatic [13, 17\u201322]. Nipah virus and Hendra virus interactions with their natural reservoir hosts, Pteropus vampyrus and Pteropus alecto, respectively, are well characterized. Experimental infections of bats with high doses of henipaviruses have shown virus replication and shedding with little to no disease [20\u201322]. Remarkably, the only viruses known to have induced any observable pathology in bats are rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus [2, 23]. Understanding mechanisms of disease and differential responses to infection in asymptomatic reservoir host species compared to species that exhibit severe pathology will help inform the development of novel therapeutics and disease prevention approaches.",

Furthermore, it has been speculated this bat could host Ebola virus [12, 25\u201327], although recent experimental infection studies have shown Ebola virus does not replicate well in R. aegeyptiacus [28]. The majority of human outbreaks due to MARV have been associated with caves inhabited by R. aegyptiacus. Furthermore, epidemiological surveillance of the R. aegyptiacus colony located in the Python cave in Uganda revealed a biannual spike in Marburg virus prevalence. This pattern correlated strongly with spillover transmission events in humans [24]. Initial studies in captive bats evaluated clinical signs, virus dissemination, and virus shedding patterns during experimental infection with a MARV isolate derived from wild bats [13]. Consistent with a natural reservoir host, the bats showed little to no evidence of disease even though the virus disseminated throughout their body and was actively shed [13]. These results were confirmed when bats were infected with MARV Angola, a strain isolated from a lethal human case [18]. In the absence of genetic and transcriptomic information for R. aegyptiacus and with limited available reagents, studying this reservoir host animal model has been challenging.",

We then assembled the high quality reads using Trinity [35] (Fig. 1b). This process generated 14,796,219 contigs. The assembly had high continuity and coverage with a median number of 718,807 contigs and median N50 of 1,540 across all tissues (Table 1). To comprehensively annotate the contigs, we used the Multiple Species Annotation (MSA) pipeline [36], which leverages the homology of known sequences of related species. We assigned gene symbols to contigs when this information was available. This process clustered the contigs into isoform groups (Fig. 1c).\n",

Without a common ground for comparison, it was difficult to perform downstream comparative analyses such as differential gene expression analysis; therefore, we combined contigs from all tissues into one unified, nonredundant reference transcriptome (Fig. 1d). To this end, we iteratively merged the assemblies two at a time, similar to the approach employed in [37] (Fig. 1d). We obtained 4,746,293 nonredundant contigs. Among the nonredundant contigs, 974,765 (20.54 %) of the sequences were annotated by bat sequences, 860,578 (18.13 %) by primate sequences, and 104,796 (2.2 %) by sequences in nt database (Fig. 2a). The nonredundant contig set had slightly lower sensitivity, though it still remained high; 86.60 % of M. davidii, 85.95 % of M. brandtii, and 95.30 % of P. alecto transcripts were recovered. The resulting annotated contigs were assigned gene names and combined using the longest annotated ORF as the transcript. This resulted in an annotation for R. aegyptiacus that contained a total of 24,118 genes. To determine the efficiency of using the MSA pipeline, we determined that 84 % (20,207 genes) of the contigs were annotated using the bat database and 16 % (3,911 genes) were subsequently annotated using the primate database. These data show that the MSA pipeline, which utilizes known transcripts from related species only, is a sensitive and efficient method for de novo transcriptome annotation.\n",

If the transcriptome assembly and annotations were accurate, the expression profiles of a given tissue should cluster with those of the same tissue origin and segregate from those of different origins [36, 38]. A gene can result in more than one transcript isoform; therefore, to capture the highest amount of information, for each gene, we focused on the transcript with the longest open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 2a). After normalizing the expression values, we performed Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to determine the relationships between the gene expression patterns in different tissues. As expected, MDS showed a clear separation of the samples according to the tissue of origin (Fig. 3a) and explains 74 % of the variance in the data. To examine the evolutionary relationship among tissues, we performed hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles (Fig. 3b). The brain, which has a different developmental pathway compared to the other organs, was classified as an outgroup. The spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow are all organs of the immune system and, as expected, clustered near each other. The peripheral blood contains some of the same cell types as the immune organs, thus, clustered near these tissues. Lastly, the gonads and kidney, which develop from the intermediate mesoderm, were grouped as neighbors in the tree. These results suggest that our transcriptome captured sufficient heterogeneity of gene expression to distinguish individual tissues while preserving their developmental relationships.\n",

One important aspect of reservoir host biology is how their immune response compares to that of animal species that experiences severe disease, such as humans. Therefore, we examined the transcriptome for the presence of immune-related genes. We associated the R. aegyptiacus gene set with GO terms based on the human-specific gene ontology annotation. This resulted in 14,781 genes that mapped to 14,817 GO terms. We used CateGOrizer [39] and applied the immune class GOSlim terms to identify immune-related genes from this set. Similar to previous studies in P. alecto and A. jamaicensis, we found that out of 14,817 GO terms, approximately 2.75 % were associated with immune response [32, 33]. Amongst the most represented GO terms were cytokine production, lymphocyte activation, T cell activation, regulation of apoptosis, and regulation of lymphocyte activation (Fig. 5).\n",

A variety of antiviral molecules were also found, including Mx1 and Mx2, PKR, STING, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, members of the IFIT and IFITM families, and ISG15. We also looked for the presence of type I, II, and III interferons (IFN). We were able to identify IFNgamma, IFNgamma2, and IFNalpha. Transcripts corresponding to the IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were also identified. IFNalpha and IFNbeta have been previously characterized by cloning from stimulated cells [40]. We, however, did not find any contigs corresponding to IFNB. To eliminate the possibility of an impaired assembly, we aligned the processed RNA-seq reads to the IFNB sequence from P. alecto [41] (Additional file 2 and Additional file 3). We detected only 2 reads from R. aegyptiacus,which did not provide sufficient coverage to construct the transcript. These data suggest that IFNB expression in healthy tissues of R. aegyptiacus is low, consistent with other mammals in which IFNB is primarily expressed after exposure to a stimulus.",

Transcripts of genes encoding for molecules in the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) family, including NKG2A and NKG2D, were also not found. In other bat transcriptomes, such as P. alecto and A. jamaicensis, coverage of NK cell-related genes was more sparse than that of other mammals [32, 33]. A similar observation was made in the genome of M. davidii [30].

Of those, 71.6 % (2,008,503 contigs) did not have an ORF suggesting the majority of these contigs may be noncoding transcripts. To determine if the unannotated contigs were real or artifacts from the assembly, we used BLAST to align this set of contigs to the P. alecto genome and found that 96 % (2,706,432 contigs) were aligned. To evaluate the possibility of an incomplete or impaired assembly, we grouped the aligned contigs into a total of 1,012,664 clusters based on the presence of overlapping sequences. This reduction suggests that multiple isoform expression patterns between different tissues may have affected our assembly or that our short read assembly may have been incomplete. Nonetheless, the number of unannotated contigs that aligned to the P. alecto genome suggests that these contigs, either coding or noncoding, may be novel transcripts shared within the order Pteropodinae. Future studies evaluating the conservation and possible functions of these sequences are essential to determine the importance of these genetic elements. To validate novel contigs in R. aegyptiacus that appeared to be coding we utilized PCR. Primers were designed to produce amplicons for eight highly expressed, unannotated contigs that contained ORFs longer than 400 bp. Using RNA isolated from the spleen, we were able to produce amplicons of the expected size from at least one bat (Fig. 6 and Additional file 4). The sequences of these amplicons were found to match the expected sequence from the assembled ORF of the unannotated contig. These contigs also showed high sequence similarity to the P. alecto genome. In particular, six of the 8 validated transcripts showed sequence similarity higher than 75 % at a query coverage greater than 64 %. The other two validated transcripts had a query coverage of 23 with 78.36 % identity (transcript 1 in Fig. 6) and a query coverage of 7 with 91.27 % identity (transcript 2 in Fig. 6) (Additional file 5); therefore, we hypothesize that these transcripts might be specific to R. aegyptiacus. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the characteristics and biological functions associated with the proteins these contigs encode.\n",

Using the same type of query, we also created a database for primates including humans due to their extraordinarily well-annotated transcriptomes, which will maximize the power of our annotation pipeline. We then used BLAST to iteratively align the contigs to the bat db, the primate db, and finally nt using a subtractive approach: what did not align to the bat db was aligned to the primate db, and what did not align to the primate db was aligned to nt.",
