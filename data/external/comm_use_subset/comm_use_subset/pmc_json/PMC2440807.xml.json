            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in industrialized countries [1], [2]. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy play significant and crucial roles in clinical anti-lung cancer treatment to achieve prolonged patient survival [3], [4]. However, a high failure rate and low median survival rate are observed in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy with recurrent, intractable lung cancer [5]. To improve the patient survival rate, investigation to elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis of lung cancer is needed [5]. Recent data have demonstrated that tumors contain a small subpopulation of cells, i.e., cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) or cancer-initiating cells (CICs), which exhibit a self-renewing capacity and are responsible for tumor maintenance and metastasis [6]. Stem cells have been isolated by their ability to efflux Hoechst 33342 dye and are referred to as the \u201cside population (SP)\u201d [7]. Ho and colleagues isolated and characterized SP cells from six human lung cancer cell lines and showed that an elevated expression of ABCG2 as well as other ATP-binding cassette transporters were positively correlated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs [8]. In addition, Gutova and colleagues have purified uPAR-positive CSCs from three lung cancer cell lines. These uPAR-positive cells co-expressed with CD44 and MDR1, and had the ability to promote advanced malignancy and chemoresistance [9].",

Recently, CD133 has been considered an important marker to represent the subset population of CSCs in leukemia, brain tumors, retinoblastoma, renal tumors, pancreatic tumors, colon carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma [11]\u2013[19]. Based on immunohistochemical findings, Hilbe and colleagues suggested that CD133-positive (CD133+) progenitor cells play a role in the development of tumor vasculature in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [20]. More recently, a well-designed study by Eramo and colleagues showed that lung cancer contains a population of CD133+ CSCs able to self-renew and generate an unlimited progeny of non-tumorigenic cells. These CD133+ cells are also resistant to conventional chemotherapy [21]. However, the gene regulation mechanisms in maintaining the self-renewal and drug-resistant properties in putative cancer stem-like cells of lung tumors are still unclear.",

Oct-4 mRNA is normally found in totipotent and pluripotent stem cells of pregastrulation embryos [24]. Knocking out the Oct-4 gene in mice causes early lethality due to the lack of ICM formation, indicating that Oct-4 has a critical function for self-renewal of ES cells [25]. Oct-4 activates transcription via octamer motifs, and Oct-4 binding sites have been found in various genes, including fgf 4 (fibroblast growth factor 4) and pdgf\u03b1r (platelet-derived growth factor \u03b1 receptor) [26], [27]. This suggests that Oct-4 functions as a master switch during differentiation by regulating the pluripotent potentials of the stem cell, and Oct-4 plays a pivotal role in mammalian development [24], [25].",

The histological examination demonstrated that the prominent neovascularization and thrombus formation were detected in the pulmonary parenchyma of LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice (Fig. 3A9). In contrast, no significant tumor foci or neovascular formation was found in the lungs of LC-CD133\u2212-injected SCID mice (Figs. 3A2 & 3A3).

Results of flow cytometry showed that a high percentage (60%) of CD133-positive cells was detected in the second tumor (Fig. 3C). In addition, one thousand LC-CD133+ isolated from the second tumor can also generate a new (third) tumor in transplanted SCID mice (Fig. 3C).

We further tested four common chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin, VP16 (etoposide), doxorubicin, paclitaxel. Compared with LC-CD133\u2212, LC-CD133+ are significantly resistant to the four tested chemotherapeutic agents (p<0.01; Fig. 4A). To further determine the radiation effect on the rate of tumor growth, we used an ionizing radiation (IR) dose from 0 to 10 Gy to treat both LC-CD133+ and LC-CD133\u2212. As shown in Fig. 3B, after IR treatment, the survival rate and number of LC-CD133+ were significantly higher than those of LC-CD133\u2212 (p<0.01). We further found that the LC-CD133+ cells possess a higher degree of radioresistance (p<0.01; Fig. 4B). Moreover, we investigated the combined treatment effect of radiochemotherapy in LC-CD133+. Experiments were conducted with cisplatin (10 \u00b5M) alone, VP-16 (10 \u00b5M) alone, or combined cisplatin and VP-16 on IR (2 Gy)-treated LC-CD133+. As shown in Figure 3C, the data revealed that the cell survival rate in IR-treated LC-CD133+ was not significantly decreased by the IR treatment combined with cisplatin, with or without VP-16 (p>0.05). On the contrary, cell survival significantly declined after chemotherapy with cisplatin combined with VP-16 in IR-treated LC-CD133\u2212 (p<0.01; Fig. 4C). These results suggest that LC-CD133+ may play a vital role in the tumor's ability to resist radiation and chemotherapies.",

To validate this finding, we examined expression of Oct-4 both transcriptionally and translationally. The amounts of Oct-4 transcript and protein of isolated LC-CD133+ (Patients No.1 [PLC] and No.2 [LLC]) were significantly increased compared with those of LC-CD133\u2212 by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis (Figs. 5A and 5B). To investigate whether Oct-4 expression plays a role in maintaining self-renewal or cancer stem-like properties in LC-CD133+, we used the siRNA method with lentiviral vector for knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133+. We found it important that the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA in LC-CD133+ can significantly interfere with the capabilities of spheroid-like bodies (SB) formation (p<0.001; Fig. 5C). After 7 days of the Oct-4 siRNA treatment, the SB of LC-CD133+ could not maintain floating spheres but differentiated into attached epithelial-like cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the treatment of scramble control siRNA did not influence the SB formation capability in LC-CD133+ (Fig. 5C). The SB of LC-CD133+ endogenously expressed strong positive signals for Oct-4 and CD133 (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, the immunofluorescent results demonstrated that both the CD133 and Oct-4 expressions in LC-CD133+ were significantly blocked after 7 days of Oct-4 siRNA treatment (Fig. 5D). FASC assay confirmed that the amount of CD133 was dramatically decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ and the percentages of LC-CD133\u2212 were significantly increased in LC-CD133+ after 7 days of Oct-4 siRNA treatment (p<0.001; Fig. 5E). These data suggested that Oct-4 may maintain the properties of primitive stem cells and inhibit the tendency for differentiation in LC-CD133+.",

Furthermore, the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for the LC-CD133+ group can be significantly improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA compared with non-treated LC-CD133+ or LC-CD133+ treated by scramble-siRNA (Fig. 6B; p<0.001). In addition, we found that the apoptotic activities of annexin V (Fig. 6C) and caspase 3 (Fig. 6D; upper part) were quickly and effectively induced in LC-CD133+ treated by Oct-4 siRNA after 72 hours. In accordance with the result of cell survival and treatment effects in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ (Fig. 6B), the western blot data further demonstrated that the amounts of activated (cleaved) form of PARP were consistently elevated in LC-CD133+ treated by Oct-4 siRNA with IR alone or combined with chemotherapy (Fig. 6D; lower part). Thus, knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133+ can effectively enhance chemoradiosensitivities and apoptotic activities in response to IR and chemotherapy, suggesting that Oct-4 could be a key factor enables LC-CD133+ to resist radiochemotherapeutic stress.",

We first injected 104 LC-CD133+-GFP cells into the subcutaneous sites of nude mice with different treatment protocols. The tumor volumes were significantly decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ when exposed to IR alone, cisplatin alone, or IR combined with cisplatin (p<0.01; Fig. 7A). To further evaluate the capabilities of tumor invasion and metastasis of LC-CD133+ treated by different regimens, we injected 104 LC-CD133+-GFP cells from each treatment groups into the tail vein of SCID mice. The results of in vivo GFP imaging showed that the tumor foci of lung and metastatic lesions in the Oct-4-siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ groups were significantly lower than those of the LC-CD133+ without Oct-4-siRNA-treated groups (p<0.01; Fig. 7B). In addition, to investigate the treatment effects of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133+\nin vivo, we injected the seven groups with different regimens individually into the tail vein of SCID mice for xenotransplanted tumorigenicity analysis (Fig. 7C). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that the expression levels of Oct-4 in the lung tumors of LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice were highly expressed in comparison with the other treated-groups (Fig. 7C). Oct-4-IHC levels were significantly decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133+ when exposed to IR alone, cisplatin alone, or IR combined with cisplatin (p<0.01; Fig. 7C). Moreover, using combined chemoradiotherapy with the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA, the mean survival rate of the LC-CD133+ group was significantly prolonged compared with the control or other treated groups (p<0.05; Fig. 7D).

            "text": "Self-renewal and pluripotency are the central features in the definition of embryonic stem cells (ESC), and Oct-4 is a key regulator in this process [24]\u2013[26]. Oct-4 has been suggested as one of four major factors that render the reprogramming capability of adult cells into germline-competent-induced pluripotent stem cells [31]\u2013[33]. Previous studies also showed that mouse pulmonary stem cells endogenously express Oct-4 [34]. Recently, Oct-4 transcript can be consistently detected in human embryonal carcinomas, testicular germ cell tumors, seminomas, and bladder carcinomas [35]\u2013[38]. The expression of Oct-4 has further been shown in human breast cancer stem-like cells, suggesting that its expression may be implicated in self-renewal and tumorigenesis via activating its downstream target genes [39]. Herein we reported the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133+) from clinical tissue samples and lung cancer cell lines. LC-CD133+ showed strong proliferative and invasive capabilities in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). LC-CD133+ also displayed significant resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 4). We also demonstrated that Oct-4 expression was transcriptionally and translationally up-regulated in LC-CD133+ (Fig. 5). Indeed, Oct-4 functions as a master switch during differentiation by regulating the pluripotent potential in stem cells [31]\u2013[33]. Using the siRNA method with lentiviral vector for knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133+, our data showed that the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA can block the sphere formation of LC-CD133+ and further facilitate LC-CD133+ to differentiate into LC-CD133\u2212 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, in vivo animal studies demonstrated the IHC of Oct-4 in the lung tumors of LC-CD133+-injected SCID mice were prominently up-regulated, and the total lung tumor volume as well as Oct-4 IHC levels can be significantly decreased in LC-CD133+-injected mice by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with or without chemoradiotherapy (Fig. 7). In addition, we showed that increased incidence of Oct-4 expression correlated positively with the advanced stage of 78 lung cancers (Figs. S1A\u2013C). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining self-renewal and cancer stem-like properties in LC-CD133+.",

            "text": "The property of resistance to chemotherapy and irradiation treatment is the major clinical criterion to characterize \u201ccancer stem-like cells (CSCs)\u201d [6]. The existence of cancer stem-like cells may explain why conventional anti-cancer therapies are able only to suppress or shrink a tumor but often cannot completely eradicate it, resulting in eventual recurrence [6], [40], [41]. Consistent with these hypotheses, LC-CD133+ were significantly resistant to cisplatin, VP16 (eptoposide), doxorubicin, and paclitaxel than LC-CD133\u2212 (p<0.001; Fig. 4). Even IR alone or a single chemodrug can effectively inhibit cell growth of LC-CD133\u2212 (Fig. 4); however, IR treatment combined with cisplatin and VP-16 still failed to cause cell death in treated LC-CD133+ (Fig. 4D). To overcome resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in LC-CD133+, treatment of Oct-4 siRNA was used and results showed that the knockdown Oct-4 in LC-CD133+ can significantly improve the anti-cancer effect in single- or combination-treated LC-CD133+\nin vitro and in vivo (Figs. 6 and 7). Moreover, the mean survival rate of the LC-CD133+ group can be significantly prolonged after the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with IR and chemotherapy (Fig. 7). Recently, Oct-4 has been suggested to be a protector for survival of ES cells from apoptosis induced by etoposide, UV, or heat shock through the Stat3/Survivin pathway [42]. Consistent with this important finding, our results suggest that knockdown of Oct-4 expression can effectively enhance the chemoradiosensitivity of LC-CD133+ through activating the apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 6). Importantly, our in vivo animal study and clinical data provide the evidence that the amount of Oct-4 in LC-CD133+ (Fig. 7C) and in patients with high-grade lung cancer (Fig. S1) is positively correlated with the degree of resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Taken together, these results indicate that the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133+ may contribute to the development of chemoradioresistance in patients with lung cancer.",

Hirschmann-Jax and colleagues were the first to observe that \u201cside population\u201d cancer stem-like cells isolated from cell lines and patients with neuroblastoma expressed high levels of ABCG2 and ABCG3 transporter genes as well as a greater capacity to expel cytotoxic drugs [44]. Monzani and colleagues further showed that cancer stem-like cells derived from the melanoma cell line highly co-expressed CD133 and ABCG2 markers with enhanced tumorigenic potential [45]. In this study, we found that LC-CD133+ are highly co-expressed with ABCG2 transporter and are significantly resistant to conventional treatment methods compared with LC-CD133\u2212 (Figs. 2 & 4). Interestingly, a significant down-regulating of ABCG2 expression and an increase in the chemosensitivity of LC-CD133+ were observed when the Oct-4 siRNA treatment was given (Data not shown). Thus, more studies are needed to investigate whether over-expression of Oct-4, CD133, and/or ABCG2 play a role in the development of MDR in LC-CD133+ or surrogate markers of therapeutic response in patients with lung cancer.",
