As such, in this study, integrated expression analysis of DE miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus was performed. The results showed that the expression levels of DE miRNAs (top 6 upregulated and top 6 downregulated) were negatively correlated with their target DE mRNAs (Additional file 1: Table S6) in response to PCMV infection in the thymus. In total, 548 downregulated and 461 upregulated mRNAs were identified to be the target mRNAs of the top 6 upregulated and top 6 downregulated miRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus. For example, miR-143-3p (568% increase) was significantly upregulated in PCMV-infected thymus, but its target mRNAs DDX58 (decrease of 80.4%), CD40 (decrease of 82.5%) and IL2RG (decrease of 83.4%) were downregulated in the same sample.

Recent reports have shown that miR-10a inhibits the immune responses of Th1/Th17 cells and dendritic cell activation by targeting IL-12/IL-23p40. miR-10a has also been determined to be negatively regulated by microbes, thereby promoting the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis in the host [39, 40]. In addition, a previous study showed that miR-155 plays an important role in antimicrobial infection. The expression level of miR-155 was also found to be increased during host antiviral responses; for example, it was significantly upregulated in EBV-infected lymphocytes and interfered with the balance of gene expression by modulating transcriptional regulatory factors [41\u201345].",
