Pandemic influenza virus H5N1 posed a worldwide threat to the public health because of rapid spread and high pathogenicity [1, 2]. The symptoms in animals or humans infected with H5N1 include fever, encephalitis, pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3, 4]. The World Health Organization reported 622 human cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection, including 371 deaths (a mortality rate >50%), from 2003 to 2013 (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/index.html). Currently, the most effective preventive measure against the influenza virus is vaccination. Several antiinfluenza medications have been widely used, including zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Unfortunately, their benefits have been significantly restricted by drug-resistance and frequent antigenic mutation [5, 6]. Therefore, the development of novel antiinfluenza agents against the H5N1 subtype is very important.",

This plant first invaded southern Yunnan Province (China) in the 1940s from Burma and Vietnam, and quickly spread across southwestern China throughout the 1950s [7, 8]. Over the past 50 years, E. adenophorum has seriously impacted the ecological environment in China's middle subtropical zones, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi Provinces, by encroaching farmlands, pasture fields, and forests [7]. Manual, chemical, or biological control of E. adenophorum has hindered its comprehensive development and utilization for economic benefit. Many bioactive components isolated from E. adenophorum have shown antimicrobial activity and immunomodulating properties [9]. In a recent study, the anti-inflammatory properties of ethanolic leaf extract was evaluated [10]. However, there have been few reports addressing the bioactivity of E. adenophorum polysaccharide (EAP).",

To our knowledge, these findings are the first to show the anti-H5N1 effect of EAP. Intranasal administration of EAP prior to H5N1 viral challenge improved survival rates of infected mice with a corresponding reduction of pulmonary viral load. The anti-H5N1 effect was very likely due to the innate immune recognition of EAP and the secretion of innate immune mediators (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) before infection. Furthermore, the effect of EAP on PRR expression (including TLR2, TLR4, Dectin-1, and MR) was determined both in vivo and in vitro. These results suggest that the innate immune recognition of EAP was dependent upon the activation of the Dectin-1 and MR pathways. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of using EAP as a novel immunomodulatory agent against influenza infection. Unfortunately, the sugar composition of EAP has not been characterized. ",

A number of polysaccharides isolated from plant and fungi exhibit effective antiviral benefits against influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes) [12\u201315]. The use of polysaccharides as immunomodulatory agent in anti-H5N1 studies is rare. In this paper, our data show the immunomodulatory activities of EAP both in vivo and in vitro.

            "text": "In previous reports, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3) were detected during H5N1 infection [23, 24]. This \u201ccytokine storm\u201d leads to the severe respiratory symptoms and host immune injury. Thus, H5N1-induced cytokine storms are hypothesized to be the main cause of mortality, and the use of anti-inflammatory agents may therefore provide a therapeutic effect [25, 26]. However, it is unclear whether the lack of proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) facilitates viral clearance. Interestingly, knockout mice deficient in TNF-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 receptor, IL-6, MIP-1\u03b1, and IL-1R or steroid-treated, wild-type mice did not have a survival advantage compared with wild-type mice following H5N1 influenza infection [27, 28]. Interestingly, prophylactic treatment of TLR3 agonist PolyICLC, which strongly upregulates cytokine production, provides protection against H1N1 and H5N1 infections [29, 30]. These conflicting studies may be explained in that the inflammatory response helps clear the virus, while aggravating host pathological damage. Elevated production of cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 are very important for viral clearance in the early stage of infection by activating the innate immune system. Once the viral infection has triggered a cytokine storm due to the high viral load, the inflammatory response causes severe pathological injury or even death. In this case, receiving an immunomodulator alone cannot help animal to survive [25]. This likely explains why immunomodulator treatment prior to viral infection results in a better survival rate [26, 30]. In our study, treatment of EAP shortly after infection or 24 h postinfection did not provide a survival advantage (data not show). ",

IL-6 plays an important role in protecting against influenza A virus as it is required for viral clearance and essential for animal survival [31]. TNF-\u03b1 has been reported to exert a defensive effect against influenza infection in vitro [32]. IFN-\u03b3 treatment in the early stages of influenza infection improves the survival rate in mouse models [33]. In addition, high levels of IFN-\u03b3 secretion stimulated by ginseng polysaccharides provide an antiinfluenza effect in vivo [12]. In this report, intranasal administration of EAP before H5N1 challenge elevates expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 compared with mice receiving PBS. The high levels of these mediators contribute to the viral clearance and antiviral response. Pulmonary viral titers following EAP treatment were lower at day 3 postinfection. In contrast, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA levels were slightly lower, while TNF-\u03b1 production was significantly lower than that of PBS group. Regarding the excessive inflammation induced by H5N1 virus, massive secretion of mediators contributes to lung injury rather than an antiviral response. Therefore, the timing of EAP treatment as a prophylactic agent is very important.",

In this study, we examined the mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4, Dectin-1, and MR after EAP treatment. EAP was found to upregulate Dectin-1 and MR mRNA expressions significantly both in vivo and in vitro. Our hypothesis is that the innate immune recognition of EAP is driven mainly via a Dectin-1 and MR dependent pathway. Binding to these receptors, EAP may activate complex intracellular signaling pathways, and increase cytokine production, leading to an antiviral response. Thus, the protection against H5N1 by EAP treatment is less likely to cause drug resistance, and may represent a broad-spectrum antiinfluenza effect.",
