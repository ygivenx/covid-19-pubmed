            "text": "Candida auris is an emerging multidrug resistant human pathogenic yeast causing bloodstream infections mainly in hospitalized patients [1,2,3]. It was identified a decade ago and since then was isolated from patients in at least 35 countries worldwide including the Middle East and Oman [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Health care outbreaks due to C. auris have been reported with thirty-day crude mortality ranging from 28% to 50% [12,13,14,15]. The first outbreak of C. auris infection involving 12 patients was reported from India between 2009 and 2012 [16], followed by the first in Europe involving 50 patients in London, between April 2015 and July 2016 [17]. The largest outbreak took place in Spain between April 2016 to January 2017 where there were 41 confirmed blood stream infections, of which five patients developed septic complications, and 140 others were colonized [18]. In the United States, the first seven cases of C. auris occurred between May 2013 and August 2016, reported retrospectively [19]. At the end of August 2019, the CDC reported more than 2000 clinical and colonization cases of C. auris from all over the US. (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html) [20].",

The main reasons hindering control of such outbreaks are the difficulties in identification, unknown population prevalence, the uncertain environmental niches, and the unclear mechanisms of spread [17,19,22]. A recent review has suggested that the implementation of broad-ranging infection prevention and control care bundles was shown in limited studies to be effective at reducing the number of invasive disease but its impact on rate of colonization was unclear [1]. We describe the first nosocomial outbreak of C. auris with genetically related environmental and clinical isolates in Sohar city, Oman, occurring between April 2018 and April 2019. ",

All the surgical and medical wards are multi-bed (6 cubicles) with shared toilet facilities and some have one or two single isolation rooms.

PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 2720 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Amplifications were performed as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 52 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, as well as a post-elongation step at 72 \u00b0C for 7 min.

Sequencing reaction mixtures contained 1 \u00b5L template DNA (0.1 pmol), 1 \u00b5L primer (4 mM), 1 \u00b5L of BigDyeTM terminator (Applied Biosystems), 3 \u00b5L buffer, and 5.5 \u00b5L ultra-pure water to 10 \u00b5L final volume.

DNA sequences were edited and consensus sequences were assembled by the SeqMan package of Lasergene software (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences were exported as FASTA files. For preliminary identification, a homology search for the sequences of ITS was done using the BLAST tool in NCBI and CBS databases down to species level. For conclusive identification, sequences were aligned with MAFFT (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/), followed by manual adjustments with MEGA v. 6.2 and BIOEDIT v. 7.0.5.2. The ML trees were constructed with MEGA v. 6.2. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was done with RAxML-VI-HPC v. 7.0.3 with non-parametric bootstrapping using 1000 replicates. For genotyping C. auris a small tandem repeat (STR) analysis was employed [25]. Briefly, DNA was extracted and purified with the MagNA Pure LC instrument and the MagNA Pure DNA isolation kit III (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Strains were resuspended in 50 \u03bcL physiological salt and after addition of 200 U of lyticase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubation for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C, 450 \u03bcL physiological salt was added. The sample was then incubated for 15 min at 100 \u00b0C and cooled down to room temperature. Four multiplex PCR reactions, which amplify 12 STR targets with a repeat size of 2, 3, or 9 nucleotides, was done for genotyping the Omani isolates, which were compared with the global collection [25]. Copy numbers of the twelve markers of all isolates were determined using GeneMapper Software 5 (Applied Biosystems). Relatedness between isolates was analyzed using BioNumerics v. 7.6.1 software (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) via the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages, using the multistate categorical similarity coefficient.",

A retrospective search of one year prior to diagnosis of the first case in the hospital microbiology data base showed no previous isolates of C. auris. Some actions were immediately taken, including: creating awareness about C. auris among the health care workers; training all staff of involved units on standard and contact isolation precautions; involving an administration and infection control committee; regular infection control rounds for the affected units, with monitoring of adherence to hand hygiene and other precautions with immediate feedback to staff; implementing screening for C. auris on routine admission to the ICU and all contacts of positive cases; and ensuring proper terminal cleaning of rooms and bed spaces. There had been a period of six weeks where no further new cases occurred (weeks 27\u201332) but starting from week 33 onwards new cases were diagnosed from different units and wards (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Environmental and health care worker screening was done in the ICU where most patients had been identified. This was followed by extensive environmental cleaning with infection control supervision. Cleaning was done with a chlorine-based disinfectant (1% sodium hypochlorite with 16.5% sodium chloride), in a ratio of seven tablets per 1.5 L of water. This was used for beds and all articles surrounding them and for mopping the floor. Different mops were used for each cubicle and aldehyde free alcohol wipes were employed to clean all equipment and monitors. All positive cases were isolated with designated medical equipment and toilet facilities. Extensive environmental cleaning and decontamination was done with fumigation with H2O2. In addition, the implementation of care bundles in all units, strictly enforced adherence to infection control measures, and instituting an antimicrobial stewardship program in the hospital, as well as a competency-based certification course in infection control for all HCWs were conducted. All the above measures resulted in earlier detection of cases and improving the outcome of patients, but the incidence of new cases had continued (Figure 1).",

The latter suggests a potential role for biofilm formation [13,17]. The role of environmental contamination in facilitating C. auris transmission, illustrated in this outbreak, confirms previous similar findings elsewhere, including the Oxford University Hospitals outbreak where sequenced isolates from reusable equipment were genetically related to isolates from patients [17,30]. Environmental screening can be problematic and not cost effective because of transient, sporadic contamination. For example, a report from an ICU in India reported less than 10% environmental contamination [22]. The same is true for health care workers screening, which usually result in a large number of samples and a very low positivity rate (less than 5% in the Indian [31] and UK studies [15] and zero positive out of 35 screened HCWs in our study). The single positive HCW in the UK study cared for only one patient, who was heavily colonized with C. auris but was not implicated in any onward transmissions, which further questions the practical implication of screening health care workers [17]. The intensive care units had been hotspots for C. auris with a great challenge in breaking the vicious cycle of environment/workers contamination\u2013patient contamination infection [32]. ",

The same protocol without UV light was used in our setting twice including when it was used for controlling a MERS-CoV outbreak, but this failed to have impact on the incidence of new C. auris cases.

There is also widespread variation between geographic clades, with thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) differences. At present, C. auris is separated into five geographic clades: The South Asian, African, South American, Iranian, and East Asian clades [8,39,41,43]. Phylogenomic analysis using ITS sequences and STR genotyping show that the Omani isolates belong to the South Asian clade. Most of the Omani isolates of C. auris exhibited non-susceptible fluconazole MICs (\u226564 mg/L). Some strains of C. auris can be non-susceptible to multiple antifungal classes, severely limiting treatment options and making infection control and prevention guided by rapid detection in healthcare settings essential [42,43,44,45].
