Thus, assessing the pattern of rash evolution is essential to identify measles patients. Erythematous macules and papules coalesce into patches and plaques within about 48 hours (Figure 3). Petechia and ecchymosis can also be seen. By the time a rash develops, within 1\u20132 days, patients will be ill appearing. After 5\u20137 days, the exanthem begins to fade, forming coppery-brown hyperpigmented patches that may desquamate. The rash initially disappears at the location where it first appeared. The rash can be more difficult to detect on dark-skinned patients (Figure 4).",

This is accomplished by assessing exposure history and patient risk and, if it exists, providing post-exposure prophylaxis (with vaccine or with immune serum globulin if the patient is immunocompromised).11 The patient must then undergo public health monitoring for 21 days to monitor for the development of signs and symptoms.
