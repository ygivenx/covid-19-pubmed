            "text": "Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) is an Alphaherpesvirus\n[1] responsible for lethal systemic infections in 1- to 2-week-old kids [2], [3] and for mild to subclinical infections in adult goats [4], [5]. Clinical manifestations in adult goats involve the respiratory or the reproductive tract [6] depending on the site of virus entry although CpHV-1 infects preferentially the genital mucosa. Following primary genital infection, the virus replicates in the mucosal epithelium and spreads to sacral ganglia to establish latency [7]. Genital CpHV-1 infections are characterized by painful erythematous-oedematous lesions evolving into vesicles and ulcers healing in two weeks [8]; balanoposthitis, vaginitis, infertility or abortion are often observed during primary or recurrent infections. Although the CpHV-1 infection is distributed worldwide and major economical losses occur in Mediterranean countries, no vaccines are commercially available. An ideal vaccine against CpHV-1 should prevent primary infection and replication in the vaginal mucosa and should interfere with the establishment of latency; in fact, reactivation of latent virus and mucosal shedding are responsible for CpHV-1 transmission to other animals in the same flock and to newborns. Interestingly, CpHV-1 shares several biological features with human HSV-2, such as, the tropism for the vaginal epithelium, the type of genital lesions and the establishment of latency in sacral ganglia [7], [9], [10].",

In addition, intranasal vaccination with a live attenuated gE negative Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) vaccine was shown to confer partial cross-reactive protection to goats challenged vaginally with CpHV-1 [13]. Collectively, the above studies have suggested that either virus neutralization (VN) activity in serum or CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgA contribute to protection although the precise role played by antibody responses to protection against vaginal CpHV-1 infection needs to be specifically addressed. In addition, the role played by cell-mediated immune responses in controlling CpHV-1 infection and reactivation remains unknown.",

Briefly, 96-well polystyrene plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with CpHV-1 diluted in carbonate buffer and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a shaker. After blocking and washing steps, serial 2-fold dilutions of individual sera or vaginal washes were added to duplicate wells. After incubation overnight at 4\u00b0C, plates were washed and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Bethyl, Montgomery, USA) or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgA (Bethyl) or HRP-conjugated sheep anti-bovine IgG1 (Bethyl) or HRP-conjugated sheep anti-bovine IgG2 (Bethyl) were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After final washings and addition of ABTS, the colorimetric reaction was measured at 405 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Biorad, Hercules, USA). The O.D. values were recorded and individual readings were reported by subtracting the O.D. values of negative control sera to the individual O.D. values. The antibody titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest sample dilution exhibiting an O.D. value of 0.2 units above the O.D. of negative control sera.",

PBMC at 2\u00d7106 viable cells/ml were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in complete medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS) for determination of cytokine secretion. PBMC cultures were stimulated with inactivated CpHV-1 (10 \u00b5g/ml) since previous studies [21] showed that optimal cytokine secretion was induced with that amount of antigen; MDBK cell lysates without virus did not stimulate cytokine secretion thus excluding any cell-specific cytokine response. Cultures left unstimulated served as negative controls. In each experiment, parallel cultures were set up with PBMC isolated from goats: i) vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only; ii) vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122; iii) na\u00efve. The levels of soluble IL-4 in culture supernatants were measured by using a commercially available ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific) shown to be able to detect caprine IL-4 [21] and the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of soluble IFN-gamma in culture supernatants were determined by using a commercially available ELISA kit (Bovigam, Prionics, Victoria, Australia) with a modification since quantification was achieved by using bovine recombinant IFN-gamma (Thermo Scientific) as a standard. The sensitivity of the IL-4 and IFN-gamma kits was 5 pg/ml. For the measurement of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells (IFN-gamma SFC) a commercially available ELISPOT kit specific for bovine IFN-gamma and cross-reactive with caprine IFN-gamma [21] was employed and the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. In particular, PBMC suspensions were directly cultured onto nitrocellulose-well plates included in the kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and IFN-gamma SFC were counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope (Leica MS5, Leica Microsystems Srl, Milan, Italy).",

The challenge was performed two weeks following the second immunization (i.e., day 25 post first immunization) in vaccinated animals. Following the challenge, viral shedding was measured according to Tempesta et al. [12]. Briefly, vaginal swabs were collected daily and placed in 1.5 ml of DMEM then were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected (0.9 ml), treated with 0.1 ml of an antibiotic solution (5,000 IU/ml penicillin, 2,500 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 10 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Each sample was serially diluted (10-fold), and inoculated (in quadruplicate) onto MDBK cells placed in 96-well microtiter plates (Corning). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and the virus titer was measured as previously described [12]. After the challenge, goats were also examined daily to evaluate the severity of the CpHV-1 infection. The body temperature was measured, and general and local clinical signs were recorded (i.e., hyperemia, edema, lesions, pain). A cumulative clinical score was determined in each animal by grading the clinical signs as follows: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. Temperature increments above normal (the normal body temperature ranged from 38.2 to 38.6\u00b0C) were graded as follows: >0.5\u20131\u00b0C = 1; >1.1\u20131.5\u00b0C = 2; >1.5\u00b0C = 3.",

Primers, probes, and CpHV-1 DNA standards employed in the real-time PCR assay were designed to target a conserved region of the gC gene of CpHV-1 Ba.1 strain [22]. An internal control (canine parvovirus type 2 DNA) was included in each assay to exclude any loss of DNA during the extraction and amplification steps. The analytical performance of the real-time PCR assay employed in this study was comparable to that reported previously [22], [23] while the detection limit of the assay was 5\u00d7101 standard DNA copies/10 \u00b5l of template.",

The kinetics of these parameters was determined and the area under curve (AUC) was calculated in each goat for statistical comparisons. Na\u00efve goats were vaginally infected and used as unvaccinated controls. Figure 4A shows that from day 1 to day 14 post challenge, goats immunized with inactivated CpHV-1 only and na\u00efve goats shed titers of challenge virus (measured by the standard cell-culture method) that were not significantly different. In particular, from day 1 to day 6 post challenge, the above groups of goats showed a similar trend of active local virus replication as they shed increasing titers of challenge virus that reached maximal levels by day 6. (log10 2.6\u00b11.4 on day 1 and log10 5.8\u00b11.1 on day 6 in na\u00efve goats; log10 0.5\u00b10.3 on day 1 and log10 4.5\u00b11.5 on day 6 in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only). In the same groups of goats, the shedding of challenge virus started to decrease from day 7 post challenge to reach undetectable levels on days 13\u201314. On the other hand, at all time points post challenge, vaginal CpHV-1 shedding was not detected by the standard cell-culture test in any goat vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122 (Fig. 4A). The shedding of challenge virus in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122 was statistically different from that of na\u00efve goats and from that of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only.",

In particular, from day 1 to day 6 post challenge both the goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only and the na\u00efve goats exhibited a trend of active local virus replication with numbers of CpHV-1 genomes increasing from day 1 to day 6 post challenge.

In fact, a decreasing number of CpHV-1 genomes was detected from day 1 to day 11 post challenge and from day 12 post challenge the CpHV-1 genomes became undetectable in vaginal swabs from this group of vaccinated goats (Fig. 4B). In addition, the number of vaginal CpHV-1 genomes measured from day 1 to day 14 post challenge was significantly different from that of na\u00efve goats as well as from that of goats immunized with inactivated CpHV-1 only. It is remarkable that, in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122, the infectious challenge virus was undetectable by the standard cell-culture test from day 1 to day 14 post challenge (Fig. 4A) and this was probably due to neutralization of the virus (whose genome was detected) by the antigen-specific vaginal antibodies (Fig. 1C). In addition, the number of CpHV-1 genomes detected on day 1 post challenge in vaginal swabs from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122 (2.7\u00d7104\u00b12.0\u00d7104) was approximately 20-fold lower than that measured in swabs from naive goats (5.7\u00d7105\u00b14.8\u00d7105) and approximately 4-fold lower than that measured in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only (1.1\u00d7105\u00b19.7\u00d7104) (Fig. 4B). Since all the animals were experimentally infected with an identical amount of challenge virus, the differences in the level of vaginal CpHV-1 genomes on day 1 post challenge could be due to the immune responses induced by the adjuvanted vaccine that could interfere with virus replication.",

The vaccine-induced immune responses were protective as they reduced the replication of challenge virus in the genital mucosa to undetectable levels and significantly reduced the establishment of latency in sacral ganglia after challenge. Since the latent viral load is the most relevant factor that predicts reactivation rates of animals latently infected with HSV [30], [31], the present results suggest that vaccination with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122 could at least influence the rate of recurrent infections thereby reducing the transmission of the infection to other animals in the same flock. To our knowledge this is the first study showing that a similar level of protection against an alphaherpesvirus could be achieved in a natural host by vaccination.",

MF59\u2122 is able to increase the immunogenicity of several types of antigens, promotes both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses and has an excellent safety record [14]\u2013[17], [32]; it is indeed licensed for human use in the European Union and it is a component of seasonal and pandemic injectable human flu-vaccines [33]. The adjuvant MF59\u2122 has been administered, mostly by the intramuscular route, to several animal species (from rodents to non-human primates) though data in ruminants are limited to immunogenicity not to vaccine efficacy [34]. After intramuscular delivery, muscle cells were shown to be targets of MF59\u2122 [35], [36], and its adjuvant activity could be associated with the active recruitment of antigen presenting cells to the injection site. The high efficacy of MF59\u2122 observed in the present study following subcutaneous administration with inactivated CpHV-1 could be due to the crucial role played by epidermal and dermal dendritic cells in priming na\u00efve T cells [37]\u2013[40]. In addition, the use of a whole virus as immunogen, rather than single glycoproteins, could have contributed to the observed high efficacy due to the presence of natural TLR ligands in the vaccine. In this regard, human trials have shown that HSV-2 subunit vaccines (containing gB and gD) are unable to confer full protection in humans [41]\u2013[43]. However, it should be underlined that although, in the veterinary field, the use of a classical whole inactivated virus as immunogen could be more practical and less expensive than the use of individual antigens, further studies are mandatory in order to identify potential protective CpHV-1 antigens that could be tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in vaccination protocols.",

The presence of Ag-specific IgG in the preferential site of entry of CpHV-1 would provide a first line of defense against infection that could be further implemented by the physiologic increase in serum transudation which occurs during the vaginal herpetic infection [44], [45]. On the other hand, CpHV-1-specific serum IgG and VN antibodies could contribute to protection by intercepting the virus escaped from the mucosa. Indeed, it is remarkable that serum antibodies specific to HSV have been shown to: i) neutralize herpesviruses at the axon terminus/synapses; ii) promote intra-axonal neutralization; iii) inhibit axonal spread to epidermal cells [46], [47]. Consistent with the above findings, the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122 vaccine was able to interfere with the replication of CpHV-1 in the genital mucosa and to significantly reduce the load of latent CpHV-1 in sacral ganglia. Indeed, in some animals (i.e., 4 out of 6) immunized with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122, the vaccine was able to reduce the establishment of latency to undetectable levels in all five pairs of sacral ganglia.",

Results from the present study seem to extend this observation also to CpHV-1. Indeed, immune serum antibodies generated following immunization seem to provide only partial protection from genital disease (e.g, as it occurs in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only), while appear to leave unabated acute viral replication in the genital mucosa thereby allowing the establishment of a latent infection in sacral ganglia. The data reported here suggest that, in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59\u2122, CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG and IFN-gamma production are associated with protective immunity against vaginal CpHV-1 infection although the relative contribution of antibody (mucosal and/or systemic) and IFN-gamma production to protection against vaginal CpHV-1 challenge remains to be specifically addressed in future studies.",
