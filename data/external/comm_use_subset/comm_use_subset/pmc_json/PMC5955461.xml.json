But some 4E-BPs contain non-canonical 4E-BMs connected by a linker (15\u201330 residues), and the motifs are not conserved and not required for eIF4G binding.15 Autophagy machinery, as another important downstream element of the mTOR signaling, is a cellular non-specific, bulk degradation process involved in removing damaged macromolecules and organelles to defend nutrient and environmental stress,16,17 which is also involved in regulating virus infection.18",

Besides conventional 2 dimension (2D) culture based immortalized cells, we also used 3 dimension (3D) cultures of primary human intestinal organoids for modeling rotavirus infection.23 These organoids can recapitulate most if not all aspects of in vivo tissue architecture of intestinal epithelium.24 We found that PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is crucial in sustaining rotavirus infection via its downstream effector 4E-BP1 and the induction of autophagy.

In human Caco2 cells, treatment with 5 \u03bcM LY294002 potently inhibited phosphor-Ser-240/244 S6 and phosphor-4E-BP1 (T70) but not the corresponding total proteins (as controls) (Fig. 1A and Figure S1A). Importantly, treatment with 1 and 5 \u03bcM LY294002 for 48 h resulted in 93.5 \u00b1 1.7% (n = 4; P < 0.05) and 81.0 \u00b1 6.8% (n = 4; P < 0.05) reduction of viral RNA, respectively (Fig. 1B). LY294002 could also significantly suppress rotavirus RNA secretion (Figure S2B). The inhibitory effect of this compound was further verified by TCID50 method, demonstrating that it could remarkably inhibit the production of infectious viral particles (Fig. 1C). Western blot assay further confirmed that treatment with 0.1, 1 and 5 \u03bcM LY294002 could vigorously inhibit rotavirus protein synthesis in Caco2 cells (Fig. 1D). The effect of this drug was also validated in human primary intestinal organoids. Immunofluorescent staining showed that phosphor-Ser-240/244 S6 was potently inhibited by treatment of 5 \u03bcM LY294002 (Fig. 1E), supporting that human intestinal organoid is also a PI3K signaling proficient model. Consistently, LY294002 inhibited rotavirus infection in organoid model. For instance, 5 \u03bcM LY294002 resulted in 86.0 \u00b1 6.4% (n = 4; P < 0.05) reduction of viral RNA in human intestinal organoids (Fig. 1F). Thus, blocking PI3K by LY294002 potently inhibits rotavirus infection in both Caco2 cells and human intestinal organoids.\n\n",

To address this, Caco2 cells were transduced with integrating lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA to silence mTOR. One (No 8198) out of 3 clones showed potent knockdown based on western blot results (Fig. 2A), which was also confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B). Caco2 cells with mTOR knockdown or scrambled shRNA (as control) were inoculated with SA11 rotavirus and viral genomic RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR 48 h post inoculation. Silencing of mTOR led to a significant reduction of rotavirus RNA (Fig. 2C), suggesting a supportive role of mTOR for rotavirus infection. Rapamycin is a clinically used mTOR inhibitor, and it was approved by FDA to treat/prevent transplant allograft rejection.25 Phosphorylation of Ser-2448 mTOR, Ser-240/244 S6 and 4E-BP1 (T70) but not for the corresponding total proteins (as controls) were inhibited by treatment with 1, 5 and 10 nM rapamycin for 48 h in Caco2 cells (Fig. 3A and Figure S1B), except for phosphorylation of Ser-473 Akt. mTOR/S6K inhibition by rapamycin was reported to trigger a negative feedback loop to activate Akt signaling,26 which might be the reason that rapamycin had minor inhibitory effect on phosphorylated Akt. Furthermore, treatment of 5 and 10 nM rapamycin significantly inhibited viral genomic RNA by 80.0 \u00b1 5.5% (n = 8; P < 0.01) and 79.9 \u00b1 5.8% (n = 9; P < 0.01) in Caco2 cells, respectively (Fig. 3B). Rotavirus RNA secretion (Figure S2C) and infectious virus production (Fig. 3C) were also significantly inhibited by treatment of rapamycin. Consistently, western blot assay indicated that rotavirus VP4 protein synthesis was potently inhibited by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3D). In contrast, rapamycin lost its anti-rotavirus activity in mTOR silenced Caco2 cells (Fig. 3E), supporting its specificity in inhibiting its biologic target to exert the antiviral action.\n\n\n",

Consistently, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I (hallmark of autophagy induction) was upregulated by rapamycin treatment (Fig. 6B and Figure S1E) or treatment with starvation (Fig. 6C and Figure S1F). Similar to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3B and D), starvation also significantly inhibited rotavirus mRNA (Fig. 6D) and viral protein synthesis (Fig. 6E and Figure S1G). Interestingly, induction of autophagy by rapamycin and starvation was confirmed to be via 4E-BP1. Because the autophagy is equally increased by rapamycin treatment, in which 4E-BP1 is not phosphorylated at all in the mutant (Fig. 6F).

To this aim, LC3 gene that is associated with the autophagosome membrane was silenced with 10 integrating lentiviral RNAi vectors. Five (no 10177, 10178, 10180, 10182 and 10184) out of them showed potent knockdown (Fig. 7A). Significant increase of rotavirus genomic RNA was found in all of the 5 knockdown Caco2 cell lines as quantified by qRT-PCR (Fig. 7B). It was further confirmed that viral protein synthesis was increased in these 5 knockdown Caco2 cell lines (Fig. 7C). Beclin1 plays an important role in localization of autophagic proteins to a pre-autophagosomal structure.32 Similarly, knockdown of Beclin1 also favored rotavirus infection (Fig. 7D, E and F). Of note, the 3 optimal knockdown (no 7865, 7866 and 7867) clones were found to increase rotavirus genomic RNA by 27.3 \u00b1 11.9 (n = 11; P < 0.01), 12.8 \u00b1 3.0 (n = 13; P < 0.001) and 8.2 \u00b1 2.1 (n = 17; P < 0.001) fold, respectively (Fig. 7E). The viral protein synthesis was further confirmed to be increased in Beclin1 knockdown Caco2 cells (Fig. 7F). Thus, we conclude that 4E-BP1 mediates rapamycin-induced autophagy machinery in inhibiting rotavirus infection.\n\n",

It directly binds to the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85\u03b2), allowing the catalytic domain (p110) to phosphorylate Akt.34 Recent structural study has provided insights into the mechanism by which NS1 activates the PI3K (P85\u03b2:P110) holoenzyme.35 White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) stimulates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, the downstream element of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.36 Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) have also been reported to phosphorylate the mTOR targets S6 kinase and 4E-BP1.37,38 In fact, PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway serves as a pro- or antiviral double-edged sword depending on the types of viruses. The pathway itself has been demonstrated to exert inhibitory effect on hepatitis E virus (HEV) replication via 4E-BP1.13 In contrast, it is also involved in promoting the infection of a broad-spectrum of viruses. Thus, blocking PI3K by its inhibitor could vigorously inhibit infection of numerous viruses including LCMV19 and coxsackievirus.39 Over-expression of p70S6K or Akt stimulates mRNA expression of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3).40 Rotavirus infection has been reported to activate phosphorylation of p70S6K in piglets.41 However, we did not found evidence that rotavirus infection induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, S6, Akt or p70S6K in our system (cells of human origin). The underlying discrepancy might derive from the differences of the species and distinct physiologic situation, since animal models in some cases are of limited relevance to human physiology.42 However, this pathway is essential in sustaining rotavirus infection, and inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling resulted in potent anti-rotavirus activity (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).",

During Sindbis virus infection, beclin 1 expression was upregulated that may result in xenophagy (a selective autophagy) of Sindbis virus to defend the infection.52 Several autophagy related genes can promote both innate and adaptive immune response to combat viral infection.53 We demonstrated that silence of LC3-II and beclin1 led to potent increase of rotavirus infection (Fig. 7).",

Thus, this study revealed new insights on rotavirus-host interactions and provided new avenues for antiviral drug development.
