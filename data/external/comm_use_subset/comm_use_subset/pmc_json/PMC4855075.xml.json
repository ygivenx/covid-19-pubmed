Ten-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) female Balb/c mice were anesthetized with pelltobarbitalum natricum. Then, 50 \u03bcL of PBS containing 20 \u03bcg of 25 kD linear PEI (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) or 2.5 \u03bcg of CTB (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or PBS alone as a control was intranasally administered twice at 24 and 48 h before challenge with 5 LD50 influenza virus H1N1 (A/PR/8/34). Mouse body weights were monitored every day, and those with greater than 25% loss of their initial body weight were euthanized as described.4",

By contrast, the body weights of the mice in the CTB- and PBS-pretreated groups decreased significantly beginning on day 2 and reached losses of more than 25% by day 8 and 10, respectively, after H1N1 challenge. The final survival rate of the mice in the PEI-pretreated group was 60%, whereas that of the mice in the CTB- and PBS-pretreated groups was 0% (Figure 1B). We then examined the viral titers in mouse lungs as previously described5 and found that PEI significantly reduced lung viral titers on day 2 after H1N1 challenge, whereas the viral titers in the lungs of mice in the CTB- and PBS-pretreated groups showed no significant differences (Figure 1C). Subsequently, we examined lung sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin as previously described.2 On day 2 after H1N1 infection, the pulmonary alveoli were relatively intact, and only a few inflammatory cells were observed in the lung tissues of mice in the PEI-pretreated group. However, the lungs of mice in the CTB- and PBS-pretreated groups were filled with abundant inflammatory cells (Figure 1D). These results suggest that intranasal application of PEI has efficacy in protecting mice from challenge by influenza virus H1N1.",

As previously reported, some of these cytokines, such as interferon, GM-CSF and IFITM3, were effective in protecting against influenza infection.6, 7, 8 As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, PEI induced a significantly higher RNA level of IFN-\u03b14 than CTB or PBS. Furthermore, the RNA levels of GM-CSF and IFITM3 elicited by PEI were similar to those induced by CTB but much higher than those induced by PBS. The RNA level of IL-17 in mice pretreated with CTB, an IL-17-inducing adjuvant, was approximately 7- and 42-fold higher than that in mice pretreated with PEI and PBS, respectively. These results suggest that IFN-\u03b14, GM-CSF, and IFITM3 are \u2018good cytokines' because they act as protective mediators against influenza virus infection, whereas IL-17 is a \u2018bad cytokine' that exacerbates pathology, primarily in the lung, after influenza infection.",
