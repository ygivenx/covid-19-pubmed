Another milder autumn wave often occurred from September through early-October and sometimes extended into the winter. The HFMD epidemics usually peaked around the start of the summer holidays, and other school vacations usually fell outside the main peak of HFMD epidemics. Hong Kong has a humid summer with relatively stable peak absolute humidity in May and August (Fig. 1). The mean absolute humidity was 17.2 g/m3 and fluctuated from 12.7 to 24.5 g/m3 during the study periods.",

Disregarding the exceptionally high Rt estimates in early 2014 due to a small number of cases, the smoothed Rt peaked at 1.12 to 1.24 in April or May and subsequently declined to below 1 in June or July preceding the peaks of the epidemic curve. The smoothed Rt usually remained above 1 for around 4 to 5 months from spring to mid-summer. A rebound of Rt occurred between August and October in autumn, then afterwards fluctuated below 1 for most of the time during winter. In the sensitivity analyses, Rt peaked at 1.17 to 1.26 by assuming a mean serial interval of 2 days; while Rt peaked at 1.42 to 1.60 when assuming the mean as 7 days. A longer serial interval led to larger uncertainty in the Rt estimates and slightly shortened the duration with estimated Rt \u2265 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The assumption on case-hospitalization risk (CHR) did not affect the point estimate of Rt but will result in narrower 95% confidence intervals for a lower CHR (Supplementary Fig. 2).",

Sensitivity analyses on the end of HFMD epidemic period showed similar results (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Results from models stratified by EV71 activity were also similar with our main findings (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

Rt peaked in around April to May, suggesting that HFMD transmission was most intense well before summer. Rt dropped below 1 in June or July and rebounded to above 1 around September, probably driven by a new cohort of susceptible children entering kindergartens and the increase in contact rates among children in the new school year. However, further confirmatory study is needed to demonstrate the difference in transmission between the entry versus higher grades in kindergartens. Rt usually fluctuated below the threshold of 1in winter although mild HFMD activity can be observed in some years, indicating a generally low HFMD transmission during winter.",

A transmission study in mainland China using a susceptible-infected-recovered model estimated a slightly higher Rt, ranging from 1.4 to 1.6 across different geographical regions22. In our study, the yearly intercepts log(R0S0 j), which is the logarithm of the product between R0 and the fraction of susceptibles at the beginning of each year, were estimated to range from \u22120.19 to 0.07 between 2008 and 2014, translating to an R0 ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 assuming 50% susceptibility at the start of the epidemic42930. Two studies using similar statistical methods estimated that the R0 of HFMD ranged from 2.5 to 5.5 for the causative enterovirus serotypes CA16, CA6 and EV71 in Hong Kong and Singapore2021. The estimates appear to be higher than that in our study, as the studies focused on institutional outbreaks rather than at the community level. In addition, R0 was highly sensitive to the assumed incubation period (R0 reduced by up to 50% for incubation period of 3 days instead of 5 days20) and the incubation period was assumed to be 5 days in the two studies, which is towards the upper end of the commonly quoted incubation period3132.",

For example, 71% of the HFMD outbreaks in 2013 were associated with the subtype CA6, but only less than 30% for other years in our study period5. In the following year, only around 10% of the outbreaks were associated with the subtype CA6, with a similar proportion as other subtypes CA4, CA10 and EV715. The remaining unexplained variance in R0 may be partly due to factors such as the different control measures in the kindergartens and schools which were difficult to measure. The unexplained variance may also due to stochasticity and individual-level factors.",

            "text": "Our results showed an insignificant positive association between absolute humidity and Rt. Together with the low R2 explained, the absolute humidity may have limited effect on the transmission of HFMD in Hong Kong. We did not identify any other important driving meteorological factors (e.g. rainfall and sunshine) on HFMD transmission, with an exception for temperature under the model adjusting for autocorrelations (data not shown). A number of studies have reported a positive association between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors such as temperature and relative humidity, although some of the studies were conducted in temperate regions678910111213. Once an epidemic takes off, the number of new cases will continue increasing even when Rt decreases but stays above 1. This feature somehow makes our results less comparable with previous findings which mostly focused on incidence. Another possible reason for the inconsistency is that Hong Kong is a subtropical city with relatively high temperature (median 27.0 \u00b0C, IQR 21.7\u201328.7 \u00b0C) and relative humidity (median 83.1%, IQR 79.4\u201386.4%) in most of the main epidemic periods and transmission of HFMD may be most efficient at a temperature of 23.9 \u00b0C and higher relative humidity22. Our model is therefore underpowered to detect the full impact of the meteorological factors due to the small number of days when the transmission is not active in Hong Kong. More evidence on the underlying biological mechanism of HFMD transmission is needed to improve the understanding of the potential effect of meteorological factors.",

Our results however did not suggest that school holidays substantially reduced the transmission of HFMD in Hong Kong. This may be partially explained by the fact that Hong Kong has relatively short school holidays except for the summer holidays. In many cases, Rt has already been decreasing well before the summer holiday (Fig. 2). Besides, previous findings showed that household plays an important role in HFMD transmission, where the transmission risk among siblings could reach 84%33. Public playground, which younger children would go for during school holidays, was reported as a risk factor of HFMD transmission1819. We did not attempt to examine the potential effect of reactive school closure due to HFMD outbreaks, during which the social activities of the children may have a very different pattern from those in holidays. There were large HFMD outbreaks in 2010 in Hong Kong which led to some school closures and had significantly raised the awareness and preparedness in the schooling setting in the subsequent years. Considering the high social cost and enhanced preventive measures already in place at schools, the additional effect of school closure to reduce HFMD transmission may be limited. Furthermore, even if the EV71 vaccine would be available in Hong Kong in the future, it may have limited effect on HFMD transmission at the population, as the EV71 serotype was responsible for less than 20% of the HFMD outbreaks in Hong Kong5. However, EV71 is disproportionately responsible for the most severe HFMD infections1.",

Our study has several limitations. First, our estimations were based on hospitalized HFMD cases and may not reflect trend of population incidence reliably if the CHR changed substantially within a short period. Second, Rt could be overestimated if there were substantial imported cases or differences in transmissibility among serotypes. Third, we adopted the dates of summer vacations from the Education Bureau, but some kindergartens started schools earlier in August. This may partly explain the rebound of Rt slightly earlier than the start of the school year in September for most schools. Finally, we could not establish causation between HFMD transmission and various potential driving factors. However, the lack of association between meteorological variables and HFMD transmissibility may indicate limited effectiveness in weather-based strategies, especially for places such as Hong Kong with strengthened hygiene measures in schools.",

Weekly and daily population were estimated by linear interpolation assuming the growing rate of population were uniform during each half-year interval. Daily counts of HFMD cases (ns) were derived from the weekly data as follows: we first calculated the weekly HFMD-associated hospitalizations rate It by dividing the weekly number by the interpolated weekly population. The cumulative incidence of HFMD-associated hospitalizations (Ct) in each week t was then calculated. We used cubic spline interpolation to obtain the cumulative daily incidence (Cs), and took the daily difference of Cs to derive daily incidence (Is). The case-hospitalization risk (CHR), which is defined as the risk of hospitalization among all HFMD cases, was assumed to be constant at 1.3%, based on a previous study in Hong Kong2.

This allowed for the different start time of HFMD epidemic in each year (Fig. 2) and controlled for the new cohort of students admitted to the kindergartens in September each year. We also carried out sensitivity analyses by defining the end of HFMD epidemic period in July, September or October.
