            "text": "Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSE) is the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis in the Western world, accounting for up to 20% of all cases [1, 2]. HSE affects 2 to 4 individuals per million people per year and can result from either primary or recurrent infection mainly caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) [3\u20135]. HSE is known to induce severe neuro-inflammation associated with impairment of neurological functions leading to clinical signs such as altered consciousness, abnormal behavior and localized neurological findings including seizure and paralysis [6, 7]. Prior to the introduction of the antiviral drug acyclovir, the mortality rate in HSE patients was over 70%, which has markedly decreased to 10\u201330% with specific treatment. However, between 25% and 90% of survivors have been reported to develop neurological sequelae [1, 8]. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) remains incomplete. It has been suggested that both direct virally-induced and indirect inflammatory-mediated damages are implicated in HSE and death following acute infection [9\u201311].",

It has been reported that microglia are implicated in the control of virus replication in the brain by producing inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as type I interferons (IFN-I), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10), C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and CCL5 [12\u201315]. In addition to microglia, it has been demonstrated that following HSV infection, a high expression of chemokines induced the infiltration of blood monocytes into the CNS through rolling and adhesion mechanisms along the brain endothelium wall [16, 17]. In mice, blood monocytes can be classified into two subsets based on the expression levels of chemokine receptors C-X3-C motif receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2): the inflammatory monocytes (CCR2+/CX3CR1low/Ly6Chi) that are actively recruited into inflamed tissues and contribute to inflammatory responses, and the patrolling monocytes (CCR2\u2212/CX3CR1high/Ly6Clow) that exert a surveillance role in the lumen of blood vessels and promote tissue repair [18\u201325]. Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that both monocyte subsets are able to infiltrate the CNS during experimental HSE and may play an important role in elaborating the immune response to HSV-1 infection [26].",

Among them, the CCR2 signaling pathway is the most studied with respect to monocytes trafficking. It consists of a G protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains that can be activated by several chemokines such as CCL7, CCL8, CCL12 and CCL13 although its most potent ligand is CCL2 [27]. Under several pathophysiological conditions, it has been reported that monocytes are mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) to the blood circulation mainly in a CCR2-dependent manner [28\u201331]. The CCR2 signaling pathway has also been shown to modulate the infiltration of monocytes into inflamed tissues of several organs including the brain, where these cells can play a beneficial or a pathologic role depending on the type of lesions [27, 30, 32\u201336].",

Information regarding the expression of CCR2 at the surface of non-hematopoietic cells in the CNS and its role in immune response are currently limited and vary depending on mouse models of cerebral insults [27]. It is reported that CCR2 is expressed by neurons, astrocytes and particularly microglia in various regions of human brain [27]. Furthermore, it has been shown that CCL2 activates microglia by triggering the release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as by up-regulating their CCR2 expression level in a mouse model of stroke [37\u201339]. In contrast, another study using CCR2-red fluorescent protein (RFP) knock-in mice did not confirm that CCR2 was expressed in the CNS. Indeed, no CCR2-RFP signal could be detected in neurons, microglia or astrocytes of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) [40].",

Such reduced levels of monocytes in the blood were associated with higher mortality rates in CCR2-/- mice compared to wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 controls [33]. However, this study did not permit to delineate the relative contribution of CCR2 signaling in blood monocytes and cells of the CNS. To circumvent this caveat and better evaluate the impact of CCR2 signaling on the outcome of HSE, we generated chimeric mice lacking this receptor either in cells of the CNS or of the hematopoietic system (i.e., circulating leukocytes). By using these chimeric mouse models, we evaluated the effect of CCR2 deficiency in each of these compartments on the outcome of HSE (survival rates), infectious titers and viral distribution, cytokines/chemokines levels in the brain, and monocytes trafficking. We report here that the CCR2 signaling pathway through blood leukocytes and, to a lesser extent, through cells of the CNS influences the control of HSE.",

Eight- to nine-week old WT and CCR2-/- recipient mice were housed in autoclaved cages with irradiated mouse chaw.

Eight weeks post-transplantation, mice were infected intranasally with 1.2x106 PFU of HSV-1. Age- and sex-matched total body CCR2-/- and WT C57BL/6 mice were used as controls. It is well accepted that CCR2 could be expressed by blood leukocytes including monocytes but its expression by resident microglia of the CNS may vary depending on mouse models of diseases [18, 27]. We have thus evaluated the expression of this receptor in brain macrophages prior to and following infection with HSV-1 by immunohistochemistry analyses in all groups of mice. No immuno-reactivity for CCR2 could be detected prior to infection in all groups of mice (data not shown). Interestingly, CCR2-positive cells that also express the microglia marker Iba1 were detected in brain sections of the olfactory bulb (not shown) and the medulla of WT, CCR2-/-\u2192WT and WT\u2192CCR2-/- mice on days 6 (S1 Fig) and 8 (not shown) post-infection (p.i.) whereas no signal was detected in CCR2-/- group. We cannot exclude that CCR2-positive cells detected in brains of WT and WT\u2192CCR2-/- animals could be blood leucocytes, which are known to infiltrate the CNS following infection with HSV-1 in our mouse model of HSE [26]. However, in the CCR2-/-\u2192WT group, CCR2 expression is restricted to resident cells of the CNS since infiltrating cells are CCR2-negative.",

Indeed, our results showed that infectious viral titers were increased in the brain of CCR2-deficient mice compared to resistant WT animals regardless of the compartment lacking this receptor (CNS vs hematopoietic system). These data suggest that CCR2 signaling in resident cells of the CNS may be involved in viral containment mechanisms since reconstitution of CCR2-/- recipient mice with WT hematopoietic cells was not sufficient to control the infection. In this context, the role played by CCR2 signaling in the modulation of the cerebral immune response is not completely elucidated. It has been demonstrated that microglia express CCR2 upon stimuli or lesions and that this receptor plays a role in the immunological response of these cells as well as in their recruitment to injured brain areas [49\u201351].

            "text": "Hematopoietic deficiency in CCR2 also resulted in higher viral titers and wider distribution of HSV-1 antigens in the brain, which were associated with a marked decrease in the recruitment of blood inflammatory monocytes. Thus, we suggest that the inefficient viral containment in CCR2-/- and CCR2-/-\u2192WT mice may be related to the altered recruitment of inflammatory monocytes in the brain. Indeed, it is believed that the CCR2/CCL2 axis is a potent pathway for \u00abLy6Chi\u00bb inflammatory monocytes recruitment into the CNS in models of stroke [52], Alzheimer\u2019s disease [47, 48] and EAE [22, 40]. In the context of viral encephalitis, alteration or blockade of the CCR2/CCL2 axis can significantly reduce the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the infected brain [15, 21, 33, 53]. In addition, \u00abLy6Chi\u00bb inflammatory monocytes appear to play an important role in viral containment. Indeed, higher mortality rates and increased brain viral loads were reported in HSV-2 [54], coronavirus [55] and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [46] infections when these cells are depleted. Our hypothesis is corroborated by a study using a mouse model of WNV infection which demonstrated that CCR2 deficiency results in higher brain viral load which was associated with a reduction of \u00abLy6Chi\u00bb monocytes infiltration in the CNS, supporting a protective role for these cells [44].",

It was demonstrated that CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice are severely monocytopenic and this is dependent on both CCL2 and CCL7 [58]. Similar to our results, monocytopenia was observed in blood of CCR2-/- mice infected with WNV [44]. However, this study suggested that CCR2 deficiency alters inflammatory monocytes accumulation in the blood but did not affect their recruitment into the CNS. As expected, our results showed that CCR2 deficiency in the hematopoietic system resulted in an important blood monocytopenia. Indeed, levels of inflammatory monocytes were decreased prior to and following infection in the blood of CCR2-/- and CCR2-/-\u2192WT mice. Thus, the lack of inflammatory monocytes recruitment observed in the CNS of mice having a peripheral deficiency may either be due to the monocytopenia or the absence of CCR2-dependent monocytes trafficking from the blood to the brain. On the other hand, levels of patrolling monocytes, for which recruitment was not shown to be related to CCR2 signaling, only decreased on day 6 p.i. in the blood of mice with peripheral deficiency compared to WT group but these cells were able to infiltrate the CNS despite their low levels in the blood. However, patrolling monocytes were recruited earlier in these mice indicating that CCR2 deficiency may influence their kinetics of infiltration.",

Indeed, the control of HSV-1 infection requires the expression of a series of cytokines, mainly IFN-I, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 [14, 59]. Other studies have also shown the involvement of chemokines since the expression levels of CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased in the brain of mice infected with HSV-1 [16, 17]. However, an excessive production of these immune mediators could be associated with an exacerbation of the disease and increased lethality [9, 11]. In this respect, the increased mortality rates observed in CCR2-deficient mice and when deficiency affects hematopoietic cells, were associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5) production in the brain compared to WT. Indeed, it has been already reported that chemokine receptors deficiency may result in increased inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production during CNS insults, which could increase brain damages as well as lethality [16, 17, 44, 60]. Furthermore, the excessive production of chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5, observed in the more susceptible groups could induce the recruitment of peripheral immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and T cells that in turn may contribute to amplify the global inflammation triggered by the virally-infected cells [11]. It will be of interest to further investigate the dynamics of these leukocytes and to address the impact of CCR2 deficiency on their recruitment to the CNS during HSE.",

(A) Flow cytometry contour plots illustrating the gating strategy used for brain leukocytes differentiation in mouse sacrificed on day 6 following infection. The CD45 marker was used to discriminate microglia (i.e., CD45low; continuous rectangle) from infiltrating leukocytes (i.e., CD45hi; dashed rectangle). Among \u00abCD45hi/CD11b+\u00bb infiltrating myeloid cells (dashed circle), monocytes subsets were discriminated according to Ly6C expression level into \u00abLy6Chi\u00bb inflammatory and \u00abLy6Clow\u00bb patrolling monocytes. The percentages of (B) infiltrating leukocytes, (C) inflammatory monocytes and (D) patrolling monocytes with respect to total brain leukocytes represent the means \u00b1 standard deviations of 4 to 5 mice per group at each time point. Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post-test. Statistically significant results compared to those of WT animals are indicated as follows: *, P<0.05; **, P<0.01; ***, P<0.001.",
