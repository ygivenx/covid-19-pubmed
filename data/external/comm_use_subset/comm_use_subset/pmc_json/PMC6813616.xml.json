They are also useful for identifying health disorders, drug toxicity or adverse effects, disease staging, and monitoring of response to treatment. Laboratory animals, especially shrew, rat, and mice, like their wild counterparts, are commonly used for biomedical research. There are 385 species of shrews under 26 genera all over the world. The Asian house shrew (musk shrew) (Suncus murinus, Order: Eulipotyphia, Family: Soricidae) is native to India and Southeast Asia and widely distributed throughout Bangladesh. The shrew is also natural reservoir of several zoonotic pathogens (Hantavirus, Hepatitis E virus, Thottapalayam virus, Borna disease virus, plague, Toxoplasma gondii, etc.) [1-3]. They are found in areas with high human activity. Therefore, they may transfer zoonotic diseases that could present threats to human health [4].",

In this study, all animals were clinically healthy so the values found were in normal ranges as expected. TLC count was within reference value, but juveniles showed higher TLC values. It was found that hematological values vary along with age and sex in case of Crocidura russula [9]. While not found to be statistically significant in this study, Hb and PCV were higher in males than in female shrews, matching similar findings previously reported by Crofton and Share [10]. This is maybe the potential influence of the estrus cycle in female. During proestrus, estrus, and metestrus, the PCV level decreases in female. The percentage of PCV also varies due to age, sea level, altitude, and in some disease situations (e.g., during periods of difficult breathing or dehydration) [11]. Blood glucose concentration was found to be higher in male tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) in a previous study [12]. Female tree shrews have significantly lower body weight and fasting blood glucose concentration than males (p<0.001) [12]. The concentration of fasting blood glucose was slightly increased with body weight in males; but the body weight, concentration of fasting blood glucose positively increased with age (p<0.001), which is similar to the current study findings. The study revealed that mean urea level is significantly higher in adults (51.43 mmol/L) than in juveniles; this is expected as urea is a primary metabolic product of protein metabolism, which increases with age [13]. Protein quality tests, therefore, should be performed among the same age groups for significant results. No significant variation was found in the level of Na and Cl between adults and juveniles, but both were higher in juveniles than in adults, which support a previous study [14]. TP and creatinine were within the reference range which is relatively similar to the result found in the study of Mock et al. [15]. The house shrew showed similar glucose and P level to the least shrew, but the other parameter values were higher in the house shrew [15]. Compared to the previous findings reported for Webster mice, Hb, TP, Ca, and P levels were higher in house shrews in this study [16].",
