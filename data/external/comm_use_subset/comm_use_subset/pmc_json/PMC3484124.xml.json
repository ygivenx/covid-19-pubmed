Aphids can transmit acquired virus for days or weeks and even after molting [1], [2], [3]. Virus is acquired when the virus moves from the aphid hindgut (HG) lumen to the hemolymph. Once in the hemolymph, the virus passes into the accessory salivary gland (ASG) and is released into the salivary duct. Aphids transmit the virus into phloem cells during salivation and feeding. Through specific interactions with putative cellular receptors [4], [5], [6], luteovirids actively cross the membranes of the aphid HG and ASG. The HG and the ASG are the major barriers to the successful aphid acquisition and transmission of luteovirids. The movement of luteovirids across these barriers is under genetic control by an unlinked set of aphid genes [7] that are additive in effect [8]. These genes encode for proteins that are differentially expressed in aphids with varying virus transmission efficiency [9], [10].",

These proteins orchestrate systemic movement within host plants and transcytosis within aphids [11], [12], [13], [14]. The 22\u201324 kDa coat protein (CP) expressed from the viral open reading frame (ORF) 3 is the major capsid protein. Occasionally, read-through translation of the CP stop codon results in the translational fusion of ORF3 with ORF5, resulting in the minor protein species component of the capsid called the readthrough protein (RTP). Virions can be assembled from the CP alone, but the RTP is required for luteovirid movement across the ASG as well as efficient systemic infection [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. These activities in aphids and plants are regulated by virion topological features, specifically interactions between CP monomers and well-defined interfacial regions within the RTP [18].",

            "text": "Although a number of aphid proteins that bind luteovirids have been identified, the molecular details of virus movement in aphids are not well understood. Due to the paucity of molecular tools for the study of aphids, most virus-binding proteins have been identified using proteomics approaches. In Sitobion avenae, four 2-D gel spots were differentially expressed between parthenogenetically-reproducing F1 clones that differed in their vectoring capacity for two isolates of the species Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV)-PAV [19]. Two proteins from head tissues of S. avenae were identified as potential receptors for BYDV-MAV based on virus overlay and 2-D immunoblot assays [5]. Other studies progressed beyond 2-D gel spot patterns to use mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the identity of aphid proteins associated with virus transmission [9], [10], [20] in effort to link the protein function to vector biology. Membrane-associated actin, rack-1, and GAPDH-3 were identified to interact with a wild-type isolate of Beet western yellows virus (BWYV). Actin and GAPDH-3, but not rack-1, also interacted with two BWYV RTP mutants displaying a reduction in aphid transmission ability [20] indicating either (a) their assay for virus binding does not reflect the in vivo functions of these interactions in aphids, or (b), that these RTP mutants still retain the interaction interface for binding with these aphid proteins. Cyclophilin and a luciferase homologue were identified from the greenbug aphid Schizaphis graminum as binding to CYDV-RPV. These proteins were also differentially expressed among different S. graminum F2 genotypes with different CYDV-RPV vectoring capacity [9], [10]. Intriguingly, all studies investigating proteomic differences of aphid F1 [19] or F2 progeny genotypes [9], [10], [19] reported the differences between vectors and non-vectors were not related to gross changes in protein expression levels. Instead, vectoring capacity was associated with a small shift in the isoelectric point of only a small number of proteins, indicating that the control of luteovirid transmission in multiple aphid species was via the expression of allelic variants of proteins that either differentially bind to the virion or participate in the various steps of the virus transmission pathways.",

However, in plants luteovirids must also replicate, assemble into virions, thwart the plant immune response and exhibit phloem-tissue tropism for host-to-host transmission by aphids, processes which likely involve the recruitment of a wide range of host factors to accomplish [21]. Interestingly, Bencharki and colleagues showed that the addition of soluble proteins to the aphid diet, including phloem-specific proteins that can interact with virions, can enhance transmission efficiency of the polerovirus, cucurbit aphid borne yellows virus [22]. Thus, we hypothesize that plant host proteins are also involved in aphid transmission. Serendipitously, we discovered that common additives to the plant tissue homogenization buffer during virus purification do not appear to alter the virus morphology or protein structure, but do render the virus non-transmissible by aphids. By comparing the host plant proteomes associated with transmissible and non-transmissible virions, proteins with potential involvement in transmission were identified. Moreover, our data indicate an increased accumulation of several virus-associated host proteins within aphids that have fed on infected plants, supporting a role for these host proteins in the circulative transmission process.",

In contrast, CYDV-RPV purified without these additives was highly transmissible by aphids (>95%) in six independent experiments (Table 1). To determine whether treated virions were unstable and being degraded during membrane feeding by aphids, treated and non-treated virions were collected from the diet following the acquisition access period (AAP) and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Importantly, treated virions remained intact in the diet following the AAP (Fig. 1). Treated and untreated virions were morphologically indistinguishable at this point (Fig. 1). Broken capsids and capsid swelling were not observed, indicating virions were structurally stable for transmission (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "Transmission of CYDV-RPV is dependent upon the virus circulating through the aphid. The interaction between the virions from each purification treatment and the aphid was evaluated, particularly to identify possible barriers to transmission. To determine if aphids ingested and acquired virus, aphids were collected following a 24-h AAP on membranes containing each type of purified virus: buffer only, EDTA-treated, or sodium-sulfite treated. Total RNA was extracted from half of the aphids from each treatment and the remaining aphids were transferred to healthy oat seedlings for a 3-day inoculation access period (IAP). Total RNA was also extracted from those aphids immediately following the 3-day IAP. Viral RNA (vRNA) was detected within aphids after a 24-h AAP for each virus treatment preparation (Fig. 2) using RT-PCR and CP-specific primers. After 24-h, vRNA can be detected in all three groups of aphids. At 24-h, virus could be in the gut lumen, and/or in the HG cells and possibly in the hemolymph. This indicates aphids were ingesting, and possibly acquiring, the virus under all conditions. For aphids collected after a 3-day IAP, vRNA was detected for the buffer only treatment (Fig. 2) indicating uptake of the virus into the hemolymph, which was supported by high level of transmission (92% transmission, Table 2). No vRNA was detected after 3 day IAP (Fig. 2) for EDTA- or sodium sulfite- treated virions in the aphids. EDTA-treated virions were still transmitted by aphids to oat seedlings (92% transmission efficiency, Table 2), suggesting there was virus uptake and persistence occurred within the aphid, albeit at levels not sensitive enough to detect using RT-PCR. However, the sodium sulfite treatment reduced the rate of virus transmission into oat seedlings (Tables 1 and 2). Taken together with the RT-PCR results, these data suggest that sodium sulfite-treated virions may not be acquired. If the virus is not acquired, any virus remaining in the lumen after 24-h may flow out of the aphid in the honeydew [25].",

Transmission efficiency was reduced when aphids were injected with sodium sulfite-treated or sodium sulfite plus EDTA-treated virions, 8% and 0%, respectively, relative to aphids microinjected with EDTA-treated or untreated virions, 78% and 91%, respectively (Table 3).

Initial results from the membrane-feeding experiments indicated that the EDTA and sodium sulfite could be acting additively or synergistically to block CYDV-RPV transmission since no transmission was observed. An identical trend was observed in the microinjection experiments (Table 3). We performed a log-linear analysis of a 3-way contingency table using sodium sulfite, EDTA, and transmissibility as the three variables. We were unable to conclusively show any interaction effects of EDTA and sodium sulfite on aphid transmission of CYDV-RPV with the number of replicates performed for either the feeding or microinjection assays.",

Two proteins, prophobilinogen synthase and adenosylhomocysteinase, were identified exclusively from preparations of sodium-sulfite treated, non-transmissible virions. Proteins homologous to most of these proteins are involved in plant defense and have been previously identified in plant phloem sap proteomes [26], [27], [28], [29].

Healthy plants were grown in the greenhouse alongside infected plants and the tissue was used in the virus purification protocol. Fractions from the gradient that would normally contain virus particles when infected plant tissue is used in the purification were subjected to trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS to identify any plant proteins that could co-sediment with virus particles based on density and not a physical association. Four proteins (Table 4) that are likely not associated with virions, including homologues of three ribosomal proteins and fructokinase, were also identified in the analysis of the gradient fractions from healthy plants. Other abundant proteins detected in the sucrose gradients from healthy tissue included Rubisco, pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructo-1-kinase, 6-phosphofructokinase, ribosomal proteins, and histone proteins (Table S1). Although many of these proteins have been detected in phloem sap in other plant species [26] and in the gradients of purified virus, the presence of these proteins is probably unrelated to the transmissibility of virions since they were detected in the fractions from healthy tissue. Importantly, no peptides were identified as belonging to CYDV-RPV indicating that the plants used for the healthy controls were not infected.",

These differences were initially thought to be due to degradation products of the RTP; since the C-terminal half of the RTP is truncated during purification [30], [31]. For both transmissible and non-transmissible virus, we analyzed gel bands corresponding to viral and host proteins. MS analysis of peptides recovered from an in-gel trypsin digestion of band containing the truncated RTP from purified virions produced nearly identical tryptic fragments representing both the CP and RTP from both treated (Fig. S1B) and untreated virions (Fig. S1C). These data indicate minimal or no differences in the virus protein composition of the virion particles. Consistent with previous reports of C-terminal truncation of the RTP during purification, no peptides were discovered in the C-terminal portion of the RTP from either type of purified virus. The highly abundant proteins (Table S1) were also found in analysis of the gel bands from Fig. S1 (data not shown) and enabled us to attribute some of the variability in the gel bands to differences in plant protein complexes that co-sediment based on their density alone.",

Here, the host-virus interactome is defined as the complement of host plant proteins binding directly to or in complex with the purified virus. The host proteins may play a direct role in virus uptake, maintaining virion stability, or help to provide enzymatic or co-factor activity during initial steps of entry into aphid cells. We hypothesized that if host plant proteins were involved in transmission, either via direct interactions with virions or by another indirect mechanism, we should be able to detect evidence of these proteins accumulating to higher levels in aphids that have fed on infected plants compared to aphids that have fed on healthy plants. A targeted proteomics approach called selective reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry [32], [33], [34], [35] was used to detect peptides derived from virus-interacting plant proteins in aphid protein homogenates. SRM detects and quantifies selected tryptic peptides within a total protein extract that are unique to the proteins of interest by monitoring specific intact tryptic peptides ions and their collisionally-induced dissociation (CID) fragments (ions derived from fragments of the tryptic peptides) based on in silico predictions of their mass:charge ratios. In contrast to the discovery approach that enabled us to ask \u201cWhat host proteins are in the different virus preparations?\u201d (Table 4), SRM enables us to ask the hypothesis-driven question, \u201cAre virus-interacting plant proteins A, B, and C, present in our aphid protein sample?\u201d.",

Proteins found in both transmissible and non-transmissible virus were also considered since they may be found in different amounts in the aphid. All of these plant proteins were checked for similarity against all available aphid and aphid bacterial endosymbiont protein sequences. Peptides from proteins that were identical to aphid or endosymbiont proteins at the amino acid level were not considered for further analysis as only peptides unique to the plant proteins could be informative for the specific measurements of the plant proteins in aphids. Those that remained included cellulose synthase, thaumatin-like protein 5, 33-kD secretory protein, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase E2, remorin, cysteine-rich repeat secretory protein 55-like, structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 3, and predicted ribosomal protein. We also included \u03b2-D-glucosidase which was abundant in healthy controls as well as the purified virus preparations. To perform relative quantification of these proteins, a method was created in Skyline [32] that identified peptides specific to each of the candidate virus-interacting host proteins and exported to a TSQ Vantage mass spectrometer operating in SRM mode. Total protein extracted from the efficient RPV-vector aphid species Rhopalosiphum padi (all developmental stages) fed on healthy or infected plants for 21 days was digested with trypsin and analyzed by SRM. Peptides from five of the plant proteins listed in Table 4 were detected in the R. padi homogenate (Table 5). A new method was created containing only these peptides, and three biological replicate samples of digested homogenates from aphids reared on infected or healthy plants were analyzed. The chromatographic retention time for each peptide was highly reproducible among all six samples (Table 5). The transitions are generally free from interference when they were detected (Fig. S2, Table S2) in the digested homogenates that were derived from aphids fed on infected plant tissue. Only one peptide from thaumatin-like protein 5, 33-kD secretory protein and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 and E2 was detected (Table 5), whereas two peptides from cellulase were detected (Table 5, Figure S2).

Cellulose synthase, thaumatin-like protein, and the 33-kD secretory protein co-purified with both transmissible and non-transmissible virions (Table 4). Cellulose synthase was detected at similar levels in aphids reared on healthy and infected plants, with fold-changes consistent across two different peptides from this protein (\u22120.3 and 0). In contrast, peptides specific to thaumatin-like protein 5 and 33-kD secretory protein were found to accumulate to higher levels in aphids that had fed on infected plants (Table 5).

We used mass spectrometry to describe several host proteins that associate with virions and to show they may even be ingested by aphids during feeding. The mounting body of evidence is that luteovirids commandeer their hosts and vectors to ensure their own survival and transmission. For instance, luteovirids move from companion cells into sieve elements but natural selection has favored their retention in the phloem of host plants and hence, dispersal by aphids. Luteovirid infection may also exert changes in the phloem proteome, changes that may also facilitate virus dispersal by aphids. A critical next experiment would have to distinguish between the following two hypotheses a) that virion-host protein complexes are internalized into aphids or b) that the virus manipulates the phloem to have a higher concentration of these proteins during infection. Due to the dynamic nature of protein trafficking in plants [61], [63], [84], [85], [86], [87] and cell-type specific transcriptional regulation [88], the latter experiment is not a trivial undertaking. The current work has laid the groundwork for these future experiments. The virus-host interactome we describe in this study provides critical insights into the biochemical mechanisms that luteovirids use for movement in plants and aphids. These plant proteins (and associated biochemical pathways) are novel targets for developing host-resistance to luteovirid infection in cereals and other crops. Furthermore, the exciting, serendipitous discovery that sodium sulfite reduces transmissibility of virions provides biochemical evidence that intra or intermolecular disulfide bonding may be required for luteovirid entry into aphid cells and may also be exploited as part of a strategy to disrupt aphid-virus interactions and ultimately to mitigate virus transmission.",

Infection was determined by yellowing and dwarfing symptoms. Tissue harvested was divided into 200\u2013300 g batches, chopped into 2.5 cm pieces and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until used. Virus was purified using a modified version of the protocol of Hammond et al. [89]. Tissue was homogenized using 0.1 M phosphate (K2HPO4) buffer (pH adjusted to 7 using 0.1 M KH2PO4) at 2.5 ml g\u22121 tissue. Tissue was homogenized with phosphate buffer containing 1% cellulase with and without 0.01 M EDTA and 0.5% sodium sulfite together or individually. Sucrose gradients were fractionated using a density-gradient fractionator (Teledyne-ISCO) at sensitivity 0.5 and chart speed set at 60 cm/h. Two milliliter fractions were collected along the entire gradient for each gradient. The virus fractions were collected as 4 ml gradient fractions and were concentrated by centrifugation for 4 h at 113,613\u00d7g in a type 70Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The remaining fractions were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended overnight in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7. Purified virus was equally divided among several tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. As a control, 500 g of healthy tissue was homogenized in phosphate buffer containing 1% cellulase and purified following the above protocol.",

Pellets were solubilized by adding a volume of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma; St. Louis, MO)/0.1% RapiGest SF (Waters Corp.; Milford, MA) solution. Samples were left to stir overnight at 4\u00b0C and then centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 5 min to pellet insoluble debris. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a Quickstart Bradford assay (Biorad) and verified using 1-D SDS PAGE as described [77]. For each sample replicate, 100 \u00b5g of protein was diluted in 50 \u00b5l 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate/0.1% RapiGest SF (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) and used as the starting material for the digestion procedure. Samples were reduced with DTT at a 5 mM final concentration for 30 min at 50\u00b0C and then alkylated with IAA at a 15 mM final concentration for 30 min at room temperature, in the dark. For digestion, a 200 ng/\u00b5l trypsin (Promega; Madison, WI) solution was prepared using 0.01% acetic acid. Two \u00b5g of trypsin was added to each sample at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1\u223650 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3.5 h, with gentle vortexing every 15 min. To hydrolyze the RapiGest surfactant, samples were acidified with HCl to a pH \u22642, final HCl concentration of 200 mM, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, and centrifuged at 16,000\u00d7g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes and frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until mass spectrometry, approximately 48 h. Impurities were removed using mixed mode RP SCX SPE cation exchange cartridges (Waters Oasis 1cc MCX cartridge).",

Two \u00b5L of the 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5L digested aphid protein extracts were injected directly on the column and eluted with a flow-rate of 300 nL/mn. The gradient ramped from 2% B (80\u223620 ACN/H20) to 37% B across 50 min, and then increased to 80% B and held constant for 5 min. Initial conditions were restored for the final 15 min of the run. Electrospray ionization (ESI) was initiated by applying 2.2 kV via a liquid junction distally from the ESI tip. The capillary voltage and temperature were 42 V and 275\u00b0C, respectively. MS analyses were performed using a TSQ Vantage (ThermoFisher, San Jose, CA) operating in SRM mode. For SRM-mass spectrometry, the doubly charged precursor ions were monitored in Q1 with a resolution of 0.7 full width at half-maximum (FWHM) and three to four singly charged y-ions for each peptide were monitored in Q3 at 0.7 FWHM. Each transition was monitored for 25 ms (dwell time) enabling a maximum duty cycle of 2.5 s.",

Briefly, to optimize collection of SRM data, we focused initial analysis on peptides from host proteins that could be detected in the matrix of total protein homogenates extracted from R. padi fed on CYDV-RPV infected tissues. From these samples, MS/MS data were collected for Skyline-predicted tryptic peptide ions from host proteins of interest. These data were imported back into Skyline for refinement of the SRM method. During refinement, we selected proteotypic peptides that ionized well (3\u20134 abundant y-ions for each peptide) and showed reproducible chromatographic retention properties and made a new SRM method. The new, data-driven, refined SRM method was exported to the mass spectrometer. Three biological replicates were analyzed using the refined SRM method, and a Student\u2019s T-test was used to compare total peak areas. A normalization factor of 0.92 was calculated by monitoring for peptides derived from two different proteins that were not differentially expressed between treatments and applied to the peptides derived from healthy samples. Both raw and normalized peak areas for each transition are reported (Table S2).",
