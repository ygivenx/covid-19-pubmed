            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (Picornaviridae) are the most frequent cause of mild upper respiratory tract infection, or common cold. They are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold\n[1,2]. HRVs are also associated with more severe diseases such as acute otitis media in children\n[3] and sinusitis in adults\n[4]. HRVs can also cause severe lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia\n[5], wheezing\n[6], bronchiolitis, and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n[2] in infants and children as well as fatal pneumonia in elderly and immunocompromised adults\n[7]. Although HRV-induced upper respiratory illness is often mild and self-limiting, the socioeconomic impact caused by medical visits and school and work absenteeism by HRV infection is considerable and the degree of inappropriate antibiotic use is significant\n[2,8,9]. More than 100 serotypes of HRV become an obstacle of development of a unifying vaccine\n[10]. There is, therefore, a high need for the development of selective antiviral agents with novel target sites to establish an effective HRV management strategy and tactics because there are currently no approved antiviral therapies for the prevention or treatment of HRV infection\n[2].",

Much effort has been focused on plants and their constituents as potential sources of commercial antiviral products for prevention or treatment of HRV infection. In the screening of plants for anti-HRV activity, a methanol extract from the leaves of Giant Crape-myrtle (called banaba in the Phillippines), Lagerstroemia speciosa (L.) Pers. (Lythraceae), was shown to have good antiviral activity toward HRV-4. Very little information has been done to consider potential use of L. speciosa to manage HRV, although the plant leaves possess antidiabetic and hypoglycemic\n[15], antiobesity\n[16], antioxidant\n[17], antigout\n[18], antiinflammatory\n[19], and antibacterial activities\n[20].",

Column fractions were monitored by TLC on silica gel plates developed with chloroform and methanol (9:1 by volume) mobile phase. Fractions with similar Rf values on the TLC plates were pooled. Spots were detected by spraying with 10% sulfuric acid and then heating on a hot plate. Active fractions 13 to 15 (1.23 g) were pooled and separated into chloroform-soluble (474 mg) and -nonsoluble (756 mg) fractions. The active nonsoluble fraction was separated into methanol-soluble (330 mg) and -nonsoluble (426 mg) fractions. The active methanol-soluble fraction was separated by TLC plate developed with n-BuOH/HOAc/H2O (4:1:5 by volume) to give an active fraction (45 mg, Rf = 0.12). For further separation of the constituents from the active fraction, a high-performance liquid chromatography was performed. The column was a 4 mm i.d. \u00d7 200 mm EC 200/4 Nucleodex alpha-PM (Macherey-Nagel, Easton, PA) using a mobile phase of methanol and water (9:1 by volume) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Chromatographic separations were monitored using a UV detector at 340 nm. Finally, an active principle (35 mg) was isolated at a retention time of 2.61 min. The isolate was obtained as green amorphous powder and identified by instrumental analyses, including MS and NMR. The mass spectrum exhibited a molecular ion at m/z 302 [M]+ and IR absorption at 3380, 1720, and 1690\u20131610 cm-1 indicates the presence of phenolic hydroxyl, \u03b1-pyrone C = O, and benzonoid C = C groups, respectively. This compound (1) was thus identified as ellagic acid (2,3,7,8-tetrahydroxy-chromeno[5,4,3-cde] chromene-5,10-dione) (Figure \n2). The interpretations of proton and carbon signals were largely consistent with those of Nawwar and Souleman\n[24]. Ellagic acid was identified on the basis of the following evidence: green amorphous power. UV (MeOH) \u03bbmax nm: 255, 360. FT-IR: \u03bdmax cm-1: 3380, 1720, 1690, 1610.

It has been reported that HRV capsid-binding compounds toward all HRV serotypes showed the existence of group A and B, based on a wide range of susceptibilities to antiviral compounds\n[43]. In the current study, the antiviral principle was determined to be the tannin ellagic acid. The constituent exhibited antiviral activity toward both group A (HRV-2) and group B (HRV-3 and HRV-4). IC50 of ellagic acid was between 95.9 and 125.8 \u03bcM toward three HRVs, although IC50 of the natural compounds stated previously is between 0.22 and 294.55 \u03bcM. Ellagic acid exhibited greater antiviral activity than ribavirin toward three HRVs and high selectivity. This original finding indicates that materials derived from L. speciosa leaves can hold promise for the development of novel and effective naturally occurring antiviral agents for two different HRV groups (A and B). In addition, ellagic acid was reported to possess anti-HIV activity, through inhibition of HIV protease\n[44]. Orobol 7-O-D-glucoside from L. speciosa leaves is also known to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity toward various HRVs including group A and B, as well as pleconaril-resistant HRV-5\n[39].",

The modes of anti-HRV action of plant secondary substances have been well reviewed by Rollinger and Schmidtke\n[45]. Targeting virus molecules is likely more specific and less toxic, but there is a narrow spectrum of viruses and a higher risk of creating resistant viruses\n[46]. On the contrary, chemicals which target cellular molecules may possess a broader antiviral activity spectrum and less risk of developing virus resistance, but may be more toxic to the host cell\n[46]. In the current study, ellagic acid does not interact with the HRV-4 particles, as preexposure of the virus to the constituent did not alter the infectivity of HRV-4 particles. Based on time-of-addition experiments, ellagic acid significantly suppressed HRV-4 infection only when added just after the virus inoculation (0 h), but not before -1 h or after 1 h or later. This finding suggests that ellagic acid may directly interact with the human cells in the early stage of HRV infections to protect the cells from the virus destruction. In addition, RT-PCR analysis revealed that ellagic acid strongly inhibited the RNA replication of HRV-4 in HeLa system, suggesting that ellagic acid inhibit virus replication by targeting on cellular molecules, rather than virus molecules. Detailed tests are needed to fully understand the anti-HRV mode of action of ellagic acid.",

The antiviral action of ellagic acid may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of L. speciosa. For the practical use of L. speciosa leaf-derived preparations as novel anti-HRV products to proceed, further research is needed to establish their human safety and whether this activity is exerted in vivo after consumption of L. speciosa leaf-derived products by humans. Historically, a tea from the plant leaves has been used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in the Philippines\n[28]. Rats fed ellagic acid at doses as high as 50 mg/day up to 45 days did not cause any signs of systemic toxicity\n[47].
