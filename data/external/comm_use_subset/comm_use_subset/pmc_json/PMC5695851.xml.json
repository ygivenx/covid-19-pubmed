Viruses use various strategies to exploit Ub and Ub-like modifier pathways, with some recruiting host enzymes, whereas others encode their own ubiquitin ligases, or their own DUBs.

The structures reported herein reveal that the loop harboring the 865-GPP-867 motif is a highly mobile flap on the otherwise rigid PRO/DUB framework a result that is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Closure of this flap brings the catalytic site region closer to the canonical OTU DUB active site as seen in complex with Ub, even though the catalytic dyad remains exposed and unusually flexible. Functional analyses of structure-guided mutants indicate that the GPP flap acts as a switch for DUB activity, making it possible to dissociate the PRO and DUB activities of the enzyme, and to analyze their function in the viral life cycle independently. Viruses carrying these mutations displayed a reduced replication efficiency, confirming the critical importance of the DUB activity of PRO/DUB in control of the TYMV replication cycle, independently of the polyprotein processing.

Superimposition of molecules 'A' and 'B' of the \u0394C5 mutant with the WT (engaged) PRO/DUB (Fig 1A) shows that PRO/DUB retains the same conformation in all three environments, with the exception of loop 864\u2013868. This loop was strongly constrained in the previous structure due to the cleaved PRO molecule's loop being bound by the cleaving PRO molecule. It is now released in both molecules of the mutant protein \u0394C5, and displays high mobility in this disengaged form. In molecule 'B', Pro866 at the tip of the loop (Fig 1B) moves by 9 \u00c5 to a position overhanging the catalytic cleft. This shift is less pronounced in molecule 'A', and the loop therefore reaches an intermediate position. Of note, temperature factors of the loop jump up in molecule 'A', indicating higher dynamic disorder in this intermediate conformation, and indeed are above those of molecule 'B' in this region (S2A Fig).",

Presence of unidentified atoms (S3 Fig), possibly covalent adducts with DTT or sulfur compounds present in our cryosolution (see Materials and Methods), complicated the unambiguous modeling of the Cys783 side chain. However, it is clear that, in this closed conformation, His869 is now close enough to abstract a proton from Cys783. The large movement of the 865-GPP-867 motif observed in molecule 'B' as compared to the WT engaged PRO is due to a distinct flexing of the tip of the beta sheet into which it is inserted. This flexing extends to the neighboring 842\u2013845 loop and, particularly, to the Asp843 at its tip that follows loop 864\u2013868 (Fig 1C). In contrast, the conserved GPP motif itself, with its two cis-prolines, changes very little, although Gly865 shifts slightly, moving in the Ramachandran plot of molecule 'B' to a region that is disallowed to non-glycine residues.",

We used as starting model the previously published structure of wild type full-length TYMV PRO/DUB, with the GPP flap in open conformation [21]. Relieved from the PRO:PRO interaction in that former crystal structure, the flap quickly closes to a conformation superimposable with the 'A' molecules of the new structures, i.e. the intermediate state. Monitoring the closure of the flap by the distance between C\u03b1s of P867 and L820 (Fig 1B) clearly shows that the flap then oscillates around this central conformation, but intermittently either closes to the other side of the cleft or goes back to the more open conformation (Fig 2A, top, the corresponding distances in the crystal structures are indicated as \"open\", \"interm.\" and \"closed\", respectively). These results confirm that the new structures complete the range of conformations accessible to the GPP flap and further indicate that the 'A' molecule best represents the PRO/DUB conformation when it neither is engaged as a substrate nor acts as a peptidase (Fig 2A, middle). Interestingly, concomitant with the initial closure of the flap, H869 comes sufficiently close to C783 that the latter realigns and the two side chains form a hydrogen bond. This bond is formed in an orientation of side chains that is identical to that in other OTU DUBs (see Discussion). However the imidazole ring of H869 is still unengaged by a third catalytic residue and remains loose, frequently breaking the H-bond to C783 (Fig 2A, bottom). These events do not correlate with the mobility of the GPP flap around the intermediate, equilibrium position. These results indicate that the organization of the catalytic site is also brought closer to the classical OTU DUB's by flap closure to the intermediate position, but is not further ordered in the closed flap conformation.",

Mutants P866G/P867G, G865A and D843A all significantly alter the dynamics of the GPP flap. First off, it becomes more mobile than in the wild type (S2B Fig). However, it does so in very different ways: In mutant D843A (Fig 2B) the loop harboring A843 does not act anymore as a spring to the GPP flap. As a result, the flap remains closed much longer, but also at times opens wider, than in the wild type (Fig 2B, top). At first sight G865A displays a similar behavior (Fig 2C, top), somewhat surprisingly since the mutation was designed to disfavor closure of the flap. However, examination of the trajectory shows that the constraint imposed by A865 leads to a twist of the flap. Only P867 comes into contact with L820 even in the most closed conformation, leaving the hydrophobic zipper half open (Fig 2C, middle), in contrast to the D843A closed conformation (Fig 2B, middle) that is identical to the crystallographic closed flap conformation. The most disruptive mutant is P866G/P867G (Fig 2D). Although the loop initially relaxes into the intermediate position, as in the wild type and the two other mutants, it is more disordered and, strikingly, in the second half of the simulation shifts to a position that is on average in an \"open\" rather than \"intermediate\" conformation (Fig 2D, top and middle). Interestingly, this opening correlates with loss of the H-bond between H869 and C783 (Fig 2D, bottom), leading to an inactive conformation of the catalytic site. These results further confirm the connection between loop closure and active site organization. In contrast, the catalytic dyad's dynamics are much less affected in the two other mutants G865A and D843A (Fig 2B and 2C, bottom).",

While demonstrating the importance of the DUB activity for viral replication, this approach suffered from possible flaws linked to overexpression of the polymerase in trans, and confined the analysis of viral infection to the level of single transfected cells.",

We also noted the insertion of a loop, directly upstream of the catalytic His869, with a striking 865-GPP-867 motif that is conserved in Tymoviridae-encoded proteins but absent from all other known OTU DUBs. Surprisingly, the two successive prolines in this motif were found to both assume a cis conformation. Here, we show that this loop is mobile, and that when left unengaged by an intermolecular interaction, the two-proline flap is much closer to the other side of the catalytic cleft, occasionally closing the gap and zipping up against the opposite Leu820 and Leu781 (Fig 1, Fig 2A).",

The tryptophan also connects to the aliphatic part of the residue on the opposite side of the cleft, a residue that is variable among OTU DUBs (I266 in OTUD2 and Q331 in EAV PRO/DUB, Fig 8B and 8C top), and that comes in sequence right before the catalytic histidine. Such a connection appears much less mobile than the TYMV PRO/DUB GPP flap. Indeed, in all available structures of OTU DUBs except one, the P side constriction is present and changes little, either between different DUBs or between free and Ub-bound enzyme. The exception is the structure of OTUD1, where the tryptophan is flipped out and the cleft consequently exposed. This conformation may reflect a state in which the DUB opens transiently to accommodate the isopeptide bond (and in the case of PRO/DUBs, the endopeptide bond) to be cleaved. At any rate, it seems that the TYMV PRO/DUB hydrophobic zipper substitutes for the stable hydrophobic constriction overhanging the C-terminal 75-GG-76 of ubiquitin in the other OTU DUBs. Thus, GPP flap mobility allows seemingly reversible restoration of the canonical OTU DUB physico-chemical layout on the P side of the catalytic cleft.",

This is in accordance with the requirements for the two endoprotease substrates of TYMV PRO/DUB, i.e. KLNGA\u2193 and RLLGS\u2193 for HEL\u2193POL and PRO\u2193HEL junctions, respectively [31], which thus do not match the di-glycine Ub C-terminus. In contrast, other (+)RNA viruses encoding PRO/DUBs evolved endoprotease cleavage sites in their polyproteins that better match the Ub C-terminus. For instance the EAV OTU PRO/DUB putative cleavage site at the nsp2-nsp3 junction is RLIGG\u2193 [22] and those of coronaviruses (CoV) PRO/DUBs are LXGG\u2193 at the nsp1-2 and nsp2-3 junctions, and IXGG\u2193 at the nsp3-4 junction [42,43].",

Indeed, two elements of the canonical cysteine DUB active site are missing. First, no oxyanion hole is restored in the more closed TYMV PRO/DUB conformations and, consequently, the catalytic cysteine remains unusually exposed on the P' side. Second, the third residue of the papain-like catalytic triad (an aspartate or an asparagine interacting with the catalytic histidine) is also still missing. Consequently, the TYMV PRO/DUB catalytic dyad remains highly dynamic and its side chains are still often misaligned and their crucial H-bond broken (Fig 2A, bottom). In other cysteine DUBs, that all harbor a third catalytic residue, the catalytic histidine is stabilized thereby. It may still occasionally swing out (e.g. Fig 8B and S5A Fig, bottom right) but this is associated with an inactive configuration, because the histidine then points away from the other two residues of the triad [46]. Thus the peculiarly mobile catalytic dyad of the TYMV PRO/DUB active site may reflect a need to be further stabilized and/or completed by binding of partners.

In turn, mutants interfering with flap closure display phenotypes that are selectively defective in DUB activity. We thus conclude that loop mobility allows alternative recognition of different sequences on the P side, and likely (in)activation of the catalytic site itself. In this scheme, the closed flap conformation is associated with DUB activity, the intermediate conformation with PRO activity, and the open conformation with an inactive PRO/DUB, as borne out by our previous structure of a PRO:PRO complex [21].",

Thus, the Ile847 patch seems less critical for PRO than for DUB activity. This may be linked to the fact that the cleaving PRO also uses two other distant patches (borne by its N-terminal lobe) to recognize its substrate, thus possibly making the Ile847 patch less central to recognition of the PRO substrates. In contrast, recognition of Ub mainly involves a single distant patch recognizing the Ub surface centered on Ile44. While this distant patch differs in different DUBs, all published work reveals that patch disruption impairs DUB activity and could lead to the uncoupling of PRO/DUB dual activities.",

While traces of intermediate cleavage products were occasionally detected for 98K mutants in the PRO trans-cleavage assays (Fig 5), the possible contribution of partially impaired 206K cleavage to the viral replication deficiency was ruled out by the analysis of viral replication proteins produced upon infection (Fig 6C and 6D), as only fully mature proteins were detected under such conditions. Interestingly, a similar effect of DUB activity impairment on viral RNA accumulation was also observed in whole plants (Fig 7B). We thus conclude that TYMV DUB activity plays a critical role in the viral RNA replication process, both in single cells and in planta. This finding contrasts with results obtained upon mutation of the OTU DUB domain encoded by the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV), a negative-strand RNA virus from the Nairovirus genus [49], as well as mutations dissociating the PRO and DUB activities of the OTU PRO/DUB domain of EAV arterivirus, which revealed equally efficient replication of WT and DUB EAV mutants [22].",

We previously reported that the level of 66K accumulation affects viral RNA replication [28], and that PRO/DUB activity contributed to its degradation rate [32]. It is therefore possible that the defect in TYMV replication upon DUB activity impairment may be linked directly to the decreased stability of the viral polymerase, which would thus become limiting for replication. Alternatively, tuning the ubiquitylation level of the viral polymerase may also contribute to processes other than regulating its stability. In that respect, the (+)RNA tombusviruses were reported to assemble their membrane-bound replication complexes by hijacking ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) complexes [50], a membrane protein-sorting pathway in which reversible ubiquitylation events of cargo proteins are critical (reviewed in [51,52]). Fine tuning of the ubiquitylation level of tombusvirus polymerase appeared important in that process [53]. Whether TYMV DUB activity contributes to the assembly and/or regulation of the membranous spherule-like structures that host the TYMV replication complexes [54] remains to be determined. Finally, it is also conceivable that other, as yet unidentified, substrates of TYMV PRO/DUB may contribute directly or indirectly to the replication deficiency of TYMV DUB mutants.",

One of the most studied mechanism is that of resistance (R) gene-mediated defense responses, also referred to as effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [40, 60], in which a R protein of the plant specifically senses an effector protein encoded by the pathogen. This specific recognition triggers a range of fast and multilayered defense responses, including massive ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species, changes in hormonal balance and a massive reprogramming of genome expression [61]. ETI often culminates with the occurrence of a hypersensitive response (HR), a physiological response manifested by local plant cell death, and containment of the pathogen to the initial infection area [39, 40, 60]. Although systemic necrosis is much less characterized than HR, both responses share similar phenotype and molecular features [62], and systemic necrosis is thought to be caused by an incomplete resistance, due to late or weak interaction between the R protein and the elicitor, and not sufficiently strong to restrict virus propagation [63].",

On the other hand, the P866G/P867G and G865A mutants, which both appeared unable to properly close their hydrophobic zipper and remained in an \"open\" or \"half-open\" position, led to rapid or delayed necrosis, respectively.",

Transition from HR to systemic necrosis upon point mutation of a viral protein has indeed previously been reported [64]. At present, we also cannot rule out the possibility that other processes than HR-related responses may be involved in the appearance of necrotic lesions, such as the involvement of a general stress response possibly linked to toxicity of the mutant viral proteins, or a premature senescence pathway in response to viral infection. Future experiments will aim at characterizing those processes in more details.",

Determining the possible links between TYMV DUB and plant signaling cascades involved in antiviral immunity is an interesting question that the tools developed in the frame of this study will allow us to investigate in the future. Indeed, the TYMV mutants described herein, in which PRO and DUB activities are uncoupled, provide excellent tools for further study of the role of DUB in viral pathogenicity. Searching for additional substrates/partners of TYMV PRO/DUB, as well as system-wide analysis of the transcriptomics or ubiquitylation networks that are linked to viral infection can now be envisaged both at the cellular and whole plant level, which should help clarify the possibly ambivalent role that reversible ubiquitylation events may play during viral life cycles, being either a viral strategy to enhance infectivity, or a host defense reaction, or a combination of both [15]. We expect such studies to provide mechanistic insights into the complexity of virus infection but also to reveal how these mechanisms could be exploited to target pathogenic viruses.",

The fluorogenic substrate Ub-AMC (Boston Biochem) dissolved in DMSO was diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.8, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.5% Nonidet-P40). DUB activity was assessed at room temperature in a Hitachi F2000 spectrofluorometer in assay buffer with a final concentration of DMSO adjusted to 2% to match the DMSO concentration in the highest Ub-AMC concentration assays. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme to the cuvette and the rate of substrate hydrolysis was determined by monitoring AMC-released fluorescence at 440 nm (excitation at 380 nm) for 10 min. Enzyme concentrations for each mutant were 125 nM for WT PRO, 500 nM for P866G/P867G, G865A, D843A and I847A, and 1 \u03bcM for I847D, respectively. In order to determine the apparent kcat / Km (Kapp), the substrate concentration was kept at a concentration below 0.5 \u03bcM, where the initial velocity is linear with substrate concentration, and Kapp values were then determined according to the equation V / [E] = Kapp / [S] as described previously [32]. Depending on the batch of Ub-AMC, the WT enzyme displayed high variability, with Kapp varying between 1593 \u00b1 82 M\u20131s\u20131 and 3855 \u00b1 170 M\u20131s\u20131. Hence, the activity of the WT protein was measured as a reference for each independent experiment, and Kapp of each of the mutant proteins was normalized to that of the WT protein measured simultaneously. All experiments were performed at least in duplicate, and data were expressed as the means and standard deviations of these independent experiments.",

A snapshot at t = 24 ns from the molecular dynamics simulation of the wild type molecule was used here. This snapshot represents the typical equilibrium conformation where the GPP flap is in the intermediate position (Fig 2A, top and Fig 8A, top) and the catalytic dyad realigned (Fig 2A, bottom and Fig 8A, bottom). For clarity, hydrogens added for the simulation are omitted. (B) The cellular OTU DUB domain OTUD2 in free (PDB 4BOQ) and Ub-bound (PDB 4BOS) forms.
