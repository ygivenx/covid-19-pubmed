Among these, IgY is most abundant in serum and is critical in the secondary immune response, while IgA plays an essential role in mucosal defense [24] Notably, OTA has been shown to affect the humoral response in chicks by altering the levels of specific antibody titers in response to sheep red blood cells or viruses, such as Newcastle disease virus [25,26,27,28]. However, total immunoglobulins (Ig) quantification is very scarce and is typically performed using immunodiffusion [29], and more sensitive assays are needed to conclusively elucidate the changes in Ig concentrations in response to OTA. In addition, high doses of OTA are often used to assess the effects of OTA on the immune system [23,25,26,27,28,29]. Pozzo et al. [30] used the maximum level of OTA suggested by the European Commission Recommendation 2006/576/EC (0.1 mg OTA/kg) for poultry feeds [31] and observed reductions in thymus weights and in total serum protein, albumin, and alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globulin levels; although other parameters (such as animal performance, hematological parameters, liver enzymes, or renal function parameters) were not affected.",

The mycotoxin OTA induces immunosuppression, and prolonged exposure to OTA at low doses have more significant effects on the immune system than acute exposure at high doses [22]. In this study, we investigated the effects of OTA at various doses, including the recommended maximum dose (ECR2006/575/EC) via oral exposure. Additionally, because OTA-induced toxicity may have a greater impact during early life, when the immune system is not fully developed and when many vaccines are often administered (younger broiler chicks were used in this study). Our results showed that serum IgY levels were decreased in chicks consuming 0.1 mg OTA/kg feed, whereas IgA suppression occurred only at higher doses (0.3 mg OTA/kg feed), on day 14, which suggested that OTA may have more dramatic effects on IgY rather than on IgA production. However, after a more extended period of OTA exposure (21 days), the levels of circulating IgY and IgA antibodies were decreased, even for low-dose OTA. External secretion of IgA is extremely important for mucosal defense [29]. However, in this study, only blood samples were evaluated, and further studies are required to examine whether IgA secretion may be suppressed.",

Indeed, in this study, we also found decreased levels of serum total protein, although this decrease was detected only with 0.7 mg OTA/kg feed. Therefore, several factors must be involved in the observed decreases in IgY and IgA production. The inhibition of protein synthesis by OTA may be due to its effects on phenylalanine t-RNA synthase and phenylalanine hydroxylase. Moreover, OTA acts as a regulator of intracellular transcription of many proteins [40].",
