TCM is usually prepared as a formula by unique methods with a specific combination which contains multiple herbs [1,2,3,4]. The multiple components in a formula work together to achieve satisfactory therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse reactions [5]. However, their synergistic mechanisms are poorly understood and must be addressed using a more holistic approach [6]. Pharmacokinetic studies might further provide physiologically relevant clues to the target identification and mechanistic study of TCM formula [7].",

It contains three unique medicinal plants (Figure S1), Astragali radix, Atractylodis rhizoma and Saposhnikoviae radix, in a ratio of 3:1:1 by weight of dried plants. Furthermore, numerous pharmacological studies exhibited that there were varieties of flavonoids and saponins in Astragali radix [11,12,13,14,15]; sesquiterpenoids in Atractylodis rhizoma; and chromones and coumarins [16] in Saposhnikoviae radix, which show anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunosuppressive activities, as well as their glycoside counterparts [17,18,19,20].

Only a small number of reports are available on the simultaneous analysis of the bioactive constituents in Atractylodis rhizoma, such as atractylenolide I\u2013III [24,25,26], as its low content and similar retention behaviors make the detection difficult.

It also can be used to identify unknown compounds. In this study, 2D-LC-QTOF-MS was established to separate and identify chemical compounds in YPF, and 33 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized. The corresponding fragmentation pathway of typical substances was investigated. Then, a rapid, simple and validated method using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS) system was developed for simultaneously quantification of astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, atractylenolide II, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol in rat plasma with relatively low concentration. We applied this method to pharmacokinetic study of YPF orally administered, and used the area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0\u2212\u221e) as the weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic behavior for those main active ingredients, which was firstly elucidated.",

Given the complexity of chemical constituents of YPF, we needed to obtain the best peak capacity and maximize the meaningful difference between variable contents of chemicals in two dimensional system. The primary consideration is complete orthogonal separation mechanism, which is currently hard to achieve in reality; the most common used system consists of normal phase chromatographic columns combine with C18 (reverse phase) column. In addition, the major components of YPF decoction were all water-soluble, thus we evaluate the separation efficiency of CN (Figure 1A), Halo Hilic (hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography) (Figure 1B), and TSKgel Amide (Figure 1C) columns (normal phase chromatographic columns), which are hydrophilic as the first dimension because all separate substances based on differences in hydrophilicity. The 1D-NPLC chromatograms of the crude decocted extract of YPF were shown on Figure 1C. Almost 42 peaks could be seen clearly. It is obvious that amide column has the best peak resolution and sensitivity compared with the other two. The packing material of amide column is carbamoyl instead of aminopropyl groups bonded to silica gel, the bonded phase was significantly efficient in analysis of polysaccharides and glycosides, which exist in the herbs Astragali radix [12,13], Atractylodis rhizoma [17] and Saposhnikoviae radix [22], as well as the flavonoids, lactones, volatile oil, etc. [13].",

In early literature, some pharmacological studies [26,27,28,29,30,31] have proven that these seven constituents are the main active compounds in the corresponding individual herbs, leading to changes of overall therapeutic effects, and they show remarkable anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunosuppressive activities.

However, as discussed above, Astragali radix constitutes the most important part of YPF prescription, and we chose only seven main ingredients that have clear anti-inflammatory activity in YPF formula in this study. Therefore, it has its own limitations. We believed that plasma drug concentration of certain points can be regarded as the combination of all quantitative components in vivo, but, considering the huge differences of drug distribution and rate of elimination, the combination will be more complicated than simple multiplication, since the parameter of area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0\u2212\u221e) is very important for drug efficacy and pharmacology, it can reflects the drug exposure directly. Meanwhile, to measure the intracorporal drug exposure contribution of each component, we choose the ratio of single to overall components\u2032 AUC0\u2212\u221e as the weighting factor. Ct is self-defined integrated plasma drug concentration of total components after weight factor correction. The integrated pharmacokinetic curve shows that the integrated pharmacokinetic characteristics are different from that of any of the single ingredients, which indicates that the single ingredient pharmacokinetic characteristics cannot fully reflect the drug metabolism of the overall medicine formula in vivo.

Then, a rapid, simple and reproducible UPLC-QqQ-MS method was developed for simultaneous quantification of seven major constituents, astragaloside, calycosin, formononetin, atractylenolide II, cimicifugoside, 4-O-beta-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and sec-O-glucosylhamaudol, in rat plasma with relatively low concentrations. This method was successfully validated and applied to a preclinical pharmacokinetic study. In addition, we also used the area under the plasma concentration\u2013time curve from zero to infinity (AUC0\u2212\u221e) as the weighting factor to make an integrated pharmacokinetic curve, which may offer a broader perspective for discovering and elucidating the pharmacokinetic behavior and clinical application of the whole YPF formula.",
