Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine parvovirus (PPV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are major pathogens causing heavy economic losses in swine industry [1\u20138]. On the basis of clinical signs, it is difficult to determine whether sick pigs are infected by single or multiple viruses [9]. Therefore, it is imperative to establish an effective and rapid method to detect multiple DNA and RNA viruses simultaneously in single sample.",

            "text": "Traditional diagnostic methods of DNA and RNA viruses are mainly dependent on detection of viral proteins and nucleic acids. Currently, common methods for detecting viral antigen in solution is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but ELISA shows some shortcomings that are difficult to overcome. For example, ELISA requires at least one highly specific antibody for a particular viral antigen, but a specific antibody is not able to detect all viral strains of a kind of virus due to genotype difference; a ELISA kit is usually for one kind of virus, leading to that ELISA detection are complicated, time-consuming and expensive, and it is difficult to achieve scale detection when we need to detect a variety of viruses at the same time. In addition, it is difficult to find viral infection by ELISA when viral load is below a certain level because the sensitivity base line of ELISA is relatively higher [10, 11]. The nucleic acids-based detection methods include conventional PCR, RT-PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and real-time PCR, which have been used in the diagnosis of virus infection [12\u201316]. Although LAMP and real-time PCR are more sensitive than conventional PCR or RT-PCR, LAMP can only detect one pathogen at a time and LAMP products are difficult to identify, while real-time PCR requires special or expensive instruments and easily shows false positive results [17, 18]. However, more critical is that all the existing PCR-based assays need RNA/DNA extraction. It is known that the extraction and detection procedures of DNA and RNA are different from each other. RNA is easily degradable as compared to DNA, so in PCR-based methods of detecting RNA viruses, viral genomic RNA extracted from field samples should be utilized to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) first, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive.",

Then the specific oligonucleotides are released and characterized by PCR after the complex is washed. In the previous study, we established this method to detect DNA virus PCV2, which exhibited a detection limit of 2 copies of PCV2 genomic DNA and 10 copies of PCV2 in serum that is 500-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR [19]. However, it is still needed to test whether this method can be used in the detection of RNA virus. In this study, we aimed to develop a method for simultaneous detection of preclinical DNA and RNA virus mixed infection in the same reaction system based on UNDP-PCR method. TGEV and PCV2, as the representatives of RNA and DNA viruses respectively chosen from a variety of viruses related to porcine diseases, were used to establish duplex UNDP-PCR assays. PCV2, a DNA virus with a circular genome of 1.7 kb, has been reported to cause wide infection throughout the world and serious damage to pig producers, while TGEV, an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome, has been recognized as a principal causative agent of enteric disease [20, 21]. Firstly, the UNDP-PCR assay for TGEV was developed and identified. Then, single MMPs-based or duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR assays for both PCV2 and TGEV was developed. MMPs coated with specific DNA probes for either TGEV or PCV2 (single MMPs), or for both TGEV and PCV2 (duplex MMPs) were used to enrich TGEV and PCV2 viral genomes from serum samples, and AuNPs coated with optimal oligonucleotides (oligo) specific for either TGEV or PCV2 were used to magnify weak signals from very low level of TGEV/PCV2 virus enriched by MMPs from serum samples. The duplex UNDP-PCR assay is suitable for simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses in early viral infection, providing an effective approach for diagnosis of swine diseases.",

            "text": "TGEV, an enveloped virus of the coronaviridae family, contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 28.5 kb. The first two-thirds of the viral genome encodes two replicases and only exists in genomic RNA, while the last third exists in both genomic RNAs (gRNA) and subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) to encode structural and nonstructural proteins of virus [21, 29, 30]. In this assay, we first quantified viral number using primers targeted to TGEV gRNA and different sgmRNAs and found that viral numbers were significantly different when the primers were targeted to TGEV gRNA and different sgmRNAs (data not shown). Therefore, we designed probes targeted to replicase protein-encoding region ORF1a to quantify the amount of TGEV gRNA. Six targeted regions were selected from the 5\u2019 end, middle and 3\u2019 end of the ORF1a for designing probes 1 to 6 (Table 1). All the targeted sequences of these probes are highly conserved in variety of TGEV strains. Probes 1 to 6 were coated to magnetic microparticles to prepare functional magnetic beads MMP-p1, -p2, -p3, -p4, -p5 and -p6, respectively. To select the optimal probes for capturing of TGEV genomic RNA, capture efficiency of these designed probes were determined by conventional RT-PCR assay. The results showed that all six probes could capture TGEV RNA, however MMP-p1 and MMP-p2 exhibited higher capture ability for TGEV RNA (Fig 2A). Next, we assessed capture efficiency of functionalized gold nanoparticles coated with oligonucleotides (oligo) 1 to 6 that shared same targeted sequence with probe 1 to 6. The prepared functionalized Au-NPs were precipitated by centrifugation and were detected by RT-PCR assay. The results showed that oligo 1 and 2-coated Au-NP possessed higher binding ability with TGEV nucleic acid (Fig 2B). Therefore, in the UNDP-PCR assay for TGEV, probe 1-functionalized MMPs and oligo 2-functionalized Au-NPs are optimal for capture of TGEV RNA and formation of sandwich complex.",

Although uniplex and multiplex PCR assays were developed and tried to detect RNA and DNA virus mixed infection simultaneously, in fact, to extract viral RNA and DNA and reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA are still time-consuming and labor intensive [9, 31]. In addition, low virus titer in early stage of infection is not able to be detected by conventional PCR or RT-PCR, failing in timely diagnosis of infection. Viruses are more likely to spread across piggeries and cause more sickness and death in piglets, which will bring huge threat to pig industry [32]. With the development of nanotechnology, the UNDP-PCR based on nanoparticle and DNA probe makes it possible to detect DNA and RNA viruses simultaneously especially in subclinical infection without the need for nucleic acid extraction separately [33].",

The first advantage that should be mentioned is that duplex UNDP-PCR is more time-saving and cost-effective than other routine PCR-based methods. In this study, field samples collected from pig-producing farms were boiled with lysis buffer for 15 min to release viral genome, so there is no need to extract nucleic acid using DNA/RNA extraction kits. Particularly, unlike other PCR-based assays, extracted and purified RNA need to be reverse transcribed into cDNA. Hence, the whole detection process could be completed in short period of time. Secondly, this assay could detect DNA and/or RNA virus in serum samples with an extreme low concentration in preclinical infection. Accordingly, functionalized magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles which were coated with TGEV and/or PCV2 specific probes and oligonucleotides targeting two distinct virus genomic sequences were added to form a sandwich complex. In each binding events, the gold nanoparticles carried with large number of oligonucleotides, which could be used as templates for subsequent PCR assay. Thus, weak signals from extreme low concentration of samples were highly amplified. In addition, the duplex UNDP-PCR could detect DNA and RNA virus from large-scale serum samples simultaneously. In the reaction system, magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles coated with single and/or duplex specific probes for TGEV and PCV2 were added to capture and enrich viral nucleic acid, so this approach could detect infection of TGEV and PCV2 alone or together in a single reaction tube.",

The sensitivity of duplex UNDP-PCR was approximately 250-fold that of conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR. In terms of specificity, specific probes and oligonucleotides for TGEV and PCV2 were assessed through testing capture efficiency and specificity of different probes- or oligonucleotides-coated magnetic beads or gold nanoparticles. As a consequence, duplex UNDP-PCR showed high specificity with TGEV and PCV2, yielding different size of PCR products (501 bp and 268 bp respectively). The results of detection for preclinical samples indicated that duplex UNDP-PCR assay (29.6% for PCV2, 9.3% for TGEV and 3.7% for PCV2 and TGEV mixed infection) described here was more sensitive than conventional detection methods (4.3% for PCV2, 1.2% for TGEV and 0% for PCV2 and TGEV mixed infection).",
