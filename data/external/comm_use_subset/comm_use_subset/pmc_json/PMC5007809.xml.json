            "text": "A novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has caused severe human infections in China since February 2013 [1]. As of November 13 2015, a total of 681 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with H7N9, including at least 275 deaths, have been reported to World Health Organization (WHO) [2]. Imported cases have been reported in Hong Kong [3], Taiwan [4], Canada [5] and Malaysia [6]. Limited human-to-human transmissions were observed and raised a pandemic concern [7]. Most of the reported human infections have been severe, with 76.6 % admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 27.0 % dying [1]. Over 60 % of cases had underlying medical conditions [8]. These severe symptoms are associated with high direct medical costs. Though understanding the economic burden of H7N9 disease is imperative for understanding the societal and individual impacts of this disease and deciding corresponding health resources allocation, data on this issue are limited. Qi X. et al calculated the direct medical costs for H7N9 patients using formulae, the parameters for which were estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and doctors, from the epidemiological data or from previous publications [9]. In this study, we measured the actual direct medical cost of hospitalized H7N9 patients and its components according to the inventories of patients\u2019 hospitalization fees, and analyzed the influencing factors for the costs. This study describes the actual economic burden of hospitalized patients with H7N9 in order to present evidence on the cost-effectiveness of H7N9 prevention and control.",

Leafy lesions or lesions progress >50 % in 48 h indicated by X-ray chest radiograph; b. Dyspnea, breathing rate >24 times/min; c. Severe hypoxemia, patients\u2019 SpO2 \u2264 92 % under oxygen flow of 3\u20135 litters/min; d. Shock, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome).

The direct medical costs were found to be significant, far surpassing the annual per capita income for residents of Jiangsu Province. This disparity in costs and income was especially high in those who died from the infection. The total economic burden would be even higher if patients\u2019 direct medical costs before admission, direct non-medical expenses and indirect economic losses due to deaths or missed working time were included [9]. The mean direct cost of hospitalization with H7N9 (US$ 10 969) estimated in this research is much higher than that of hospitalization associated with seasonal influenza (US$ 1 797) [11] and the healthcare costs per patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing (US$ 1 886) most likely due to higher rates of ICU admission and death [12, 13] and the use of more expensive modern medical devices [14]. In addition, the longer hospitalization duration of H7N9 patients (compared with H5N1 and pH1N1, P < 0.001) could also be responsible for the higher hospitalization fee [15]. According to the mean cost (US$ 10 969; 95 % CI, 7 356\u201316 003) determined in this study, we estimate that the total direct medical costs associated with hospitalization of H7N9 patients across China as of November 13, 2015 (681 patients reported, assuming the hospitalization rate is 92.9 % which is the rate found in Jiangsu Province) is about US$ 6 932 408 (95 % CI, 4 648 992\u201310 113 896).",

In this study, over a half (51.9 %) of the patients got full reimbursement of their hospitalization fees, and about 67 and 87 % of the patients got at least 80 and 50 % of their hospitalization fees reimbursed. This alleviated the actual economic burden of H7N9 patients and their families greatly. However, this additional financial support was not continued. We found in our study that hospitalization fees of patients with family member monthly average income lower than \u00a5 1 000 was significantly lower than the average even after adjusting for disease severity and reimbursement proportion. This is because, for the low income group, even though the health insurance can provide some financial protection, the co-payment required is still too high for many to afford [16]. Thus, policies and regulations should be made to provide more financial support for low-income groups who contract H7N9 and other similar severe infectious diseases. In addition, patients with full reimbursement were found to have a significantly higher hospitalization fee compared with the average after adjusting for disease severity and family member average income. This should also be taken into account when making related policies and regulations in order to avoid unnecessary medical costs, as it has been reported that reimbursement restrictions had a positive impact on enhancing the efficiency of antihypertensive prescribing [17].",

Qi X. et al indirectly calculated the direct medical costs of H7N9 patients in China using parameters estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and doctors. Their results show that the mean cost for each patient was \u00a510 117 (US$ 1 619) for mild patients, \u00a5139 323 (US$22 292) for severe cases without death and \u00a5205 976 (US$32 956) for severe cases with death [9], which are comparable with our data particularly as it should be noted that the direct medical costs calculated by Qi X et al were the total costs across a patients\u2019 whole disease course, while the costs we investigated here were only hospitalization fees. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the cost of hospitalization accounts for an overwhelming majority of a patient\u2019s total medical cost. In addition, the difference in medical cost between Jiangsu Province and other districts of China should not be overlooked. For example, New Cooperative Medical Scheme, one of the major types of health insurance in China, has provincial differences in funding [16]. This difference could further lead to provincial differences in medical cost, as the reimbursement rate is found to influence the direct medical cost of hospitalization in this study.",

Furthermore, the combination of disease severity, reimbursement proportion and family member monthly average income was found to be associated with patient\u2019s hospitalization fee and these factors should be addressed in making related health insurance policies. Our results also pose some questions in clinical medication administration, which need to be further investigated. The mean hospitalization fees presented by this study could be used for estimating the total direct medical costs of Jiangsu Province and even that of China after adjusting the identified determinants aforementioned.",
