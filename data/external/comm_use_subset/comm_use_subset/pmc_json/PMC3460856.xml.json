The viral RNA (vRNA) is found in the virion and infected cells in the form of viral ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs) associated with three polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2, and PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP) [4], [5]. The virus encodes for two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the proton pump transmembrane protein (M2), the matrix protein (M1), the nuclear export protein (NS2/NEP), the nonstructural protein (NS1) and, in some influenza viruses (from an alternative translation start site in segment 1) the PB1-F2, an apoptosis modulatory protein [6]\u2013[8]. Additional viral protein products include PB1-N40, derived from an alternative start site within the PB1 ORF, resulting in a protein product that lacks the first 39 aa of PB1, and PA-X, derived from the PA mRNA and consists of the N-terminal 191 aa of PA fused to 61 aa that result from +1 frameshifting [9], [10].",

            "text": "\nDe novo synthesis of influenza viruses by reverse genetics (RG) requires not only the viral RNA but also the viral protein components [11]\u2013[14]. Thus, RG systems for influenza rely invariably on a dual promoter concept: One for the synthesis of vRNA segments and another for the synthesis of viral mRNAs [11]. Since the termini of influenza vRNAs are crucial for virus replication, plasmids carrying a RNA polymerase I (pol1) or T7 RNA polymerase promoters have been used to generate vRNAs with the exact 3\u2032 end, whereas a pol1 terminator sequence (t1) or a hepatitis \u2202 ribozyme have been used to generate the exact 5\u2032 end. Plasmids carrying typical RNA polymerase II (pol2) promoters (CMV and/or chicken \u03b2-actin promoters) have been utilized for the synthesis of influenza mRNAs [15]\u2013[19]. Despite the great advantages of this technology, and although variations to the plasmid-based approach have been developed, they inevitably rely on a cloning step [20], [21]. A system that does not rely on cloning could speed up studies on the significance of mutations in the viral genome for replication and/or modulation of virulence. In this report, Flu PCR amplicons, instead of plasmids, are an efficient and viable alternative to the plasmid-based RG system.",

            "text": "Flu GFP PCR amplicons were derived from pHW72-EGFP [21]. In order to determine whether a Flu PCR amplicon could be transfected into cells and be amplified by the influenza polymerase complex, a PCR product was produced encoding the GFP reporter gene in negative orientation flanked by the influenza segment 7 untranslated regions (UTRs) and further flanked by the human pol1 promoter and the mouse t1 termination signal, pol1EGFPt1 (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A, Table S1). Co-transfection of the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon along with 4 protein expression plasmids encoding the influenza virus polymerase complex (3P) and NP into 293T cells resulted in efficient amplification of the reporter replicon and detection of green fluorescence signal (Fig. 2A). The proportion of green cells observed was comparable to those observed in the positive control cells co-transfected with pHW72-EGFP and the 3P and NP expression plasmids (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence signal of another amplicon, pol1EGFPutr, which lacks the t1 signal, was present in fewer cells compared to the pol1EGFPt1 amplicon indicating that run off transcription by the RNA pol1 complex may result in vRNA fragments with incorrect and/or incomplete influenza sequences (Fig. 2C). As expected, no fluorescence signal appeared when cells were transfected with a Flu GFP PCR amplicon lacking the pol1 and t1 elements (UTREGFPutr) (Fig. 2D) or by removing the PB1 plasmid in co-transfected cells with either PCR amplicons or pHW72-EGFP plasmid (Fig. 2E and data not shown).",

A specific set of internal primers designed within conserved regions of these gene segments were then developed in order to maximize gene amplification from viral cDNA preparations and to assemble the appropriate HA and NA PCR amplicons (Fig. 3, Fig. S 2A and B). The pol1HApdmt1 PCR amplicon carried a full-length copy of the HA gene from the H1N1pdm strain flanked by the pol1 and t1 signals (Fig. 2A). With respect to the 072 HA gene, the internal primers were designed to delete (\u0394) the polybasic amino acid signal sequence (RERRKRRR) and replace it with one carrying a monobasic cleavage site (TETR) (Fig. 3B, Fig. S 2). Similar strategies were followed to create the NA amplicons pol1NApdmt1 and polNA072t1 from viral cDNAs (Fig. 3C and D). Full-length pol1HApdmt1 and pol1NApdmt1 PCR amplicons were obtained and confirmed by sequencing (Fig. 2E). In addition, full-length HA and NA PCR amplicons were generated lacking either the t1 sequence or both the pol1 and t1 sequences, which serve as controls for efficiency of virus rescue as described below. Sequencing results confirmed the amplification of an overlapping \u0394H5 HA amplicon, pol1HA\u0394072t1, with a deleted polybasic cleavage site and the full-length amplification of the polNA072t1 (Fig. 3F, Fig. S 2).",

To further confirm that these viruses carry a \u0394H5 gene and/or do not present additional mutations introduced during PCR amplification, each of these viruses was plaque-purified and the HA gene was sequenced and analyzed for 48 plaque-purified viruses for each of three RG viruses, H5\u0394072:7PR8, pH5\u0394072:7PR8 , and control RG-derived PR8. Every single virus isolate from the H5\u0394072:7PR8 virus group contained a monobasic cleavage site identical to the one designed in the PCR primers. Mutations were identified elsewhere but in only 4 out of the 48 sequences analyzed for the H5\u0394072:7PR8 virus and in each case corresponded to single nucleotide changes (Table S2). The mutations caused amino acids changes in 3 of them; however, these changes did not alter the antigenic make up of these viruses by HI assay (Table S2).

            "text": "In this report, a significant modification was introduced to the plasmid-based reverse genetics system [25], [26] for influenza based on PCR amplicons. In order to optimize and maximize amplification of the genes of interest, a strategy involving overlapping PCR fragments for each segment was designed and used in conjunction with a high fidelity polymerase and corresponding buffer, Phusion high-fidelity PCR master mix with GC Buffer (New England Biolabs). This enzyme performed the best in our hands, compared to seven other commercially available DNA polymerases (Supplementary materials and methods S1). The synthesis of full length Flu PCR amplicons implies producing overlapping PCR fragments with distinct differences in GC- versus AT-rich regions. The human and canine pol1 promoters are approximately 75% GC-rich whereas the HA segment is approximately 60% AT-rich (data not shown). The approach succeeded in producing overlapping PCR amplicons for the HA and NA segments from different subtypes, including H1N1pdm, H5N1, or H9N2 (not shown) and from the 6 internal gene segments of the PR8 strain by designing overlapping primers and optimizing the PCR conditions (Fig. S 2). The amount obtained in each reaction for full length Flu PCR amplicons was in the order of 1\u223c5 \u00b5g (Fig. 2), which is sufficient for transfection and virus rescue and comparable to the amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection in the conventional plasmid-based RG system (Table 1). For the H5N1 vaccine candidates, the polybasic cleavage site (RERRRKKR) in highly pathogenic strains was easily removed and replaced by a low pathogenic sequence (TETR) by virtue of adequate set of primers and overlapping PCR (Table S1, Fig. 3 and Fig. S 2). Plaque assays revealed that the rescued H5\u0394072PCR:7PR8 virus was strictly dependent on the presence of TPCK-trypsin, which strongly suggests that the virus preparation was devoid of any wild type virus contaminant (Fig. 4C. This is not surprising since each overlapping PCR fragment is produced and purified independently prior to assembly the reaction to generate the full length PCR product. In addition, a low mutation rate was observed with approximately 8% of the plaque-purified viruses having a single nucleotide mutation. It is not fully understood at this stage whether those mutations are naturally present in the wild type 072 virus. Notably, the HA gene of clone 43 (Table S2) contained a mutation at aa position 151, which was shown related to a switch of receptor specificity from \u03b1 2,3 to \u03b1 2, 6 linked sialic acids [27]. Since the 072 virus used in this report has undergone more than one passage in eggs, it is possible that the homogeneity of its population had contributed to the finding of the small mutation rate among the H5\u0394072PCR:7PR8 clones. Nevertheless, the results clearly show that the PCR-based RG strategy does not create a heterogeneous virus population. In this regard, it could be argued that the PCR-based approach will be most likely better represent the virus population present in the original virus isolated compared to the plasmid-based system.",

Such analysis is beyond the scope of the present report. It could also be argued that the PCR-based system may produce a more variable virus population than the one that is obtained using the plasmid-based system. Although there is such possibility, it is an inherent nature of influenza viruses to evolve through point mutations and therefore no reverse genetics system is error free. However, the sequencing of reassortants produced in this study does not show mutations that would alter the antigenicity of the HA surface proteins. In this regard, for vaccine development, as long as the vaccine seed stock is antigenically identical to the vaccine candidate, other mutations would be irrelevant. In fact, inactivated influenza vaccines prepared by classical reassortment have only two pre-requisites: 1) HA surface gene derived from the vaccine candidate and 2) high growth in eggs. Full genome sequencing of vaccine viruses is not a pre-requisite for approval of the vaccine by the FDA.",

Using a combination of PCR amplicons and plasmids, it would be possible to streamline the study of gene variants for one or more gene segments and determine fitness, pathogenesis or any other biological aspect of the virus. Several mutant viruses with mutations in one or more genes could be produced without having to prepare individual clones. Recovery of viruses entirely from PCR products implies that other viral systems could be amenable to a similar strategy. This could be particularly important for viruses with genomes larger than the influenza virus that are occasionally associated with cloning difficulties or plasmid instability. In fact, PCR amplification for the purpose of virus generation has already been done for coronaviruses, although the PCR product was used as template for in vitro RNA transcription and the resulting RNA was later transfected into cells [28]. In summary, a RG system for influenza was developed that does not require a cloning step for recovery of viruses and has profound implications for vaccine development, pandemic preparedness, and for the study of influenza viruses.",

B) and C) Positive viral antigen green signal detected using mAb 3B2 in cells infected with either the H1N1pdmutr:6PR8 or H1N1pdm:6PR8 viruses, respectively (X10). D) mAb DPJY01 specific to H5N1 virus has no reaction with PR8-infected cells (X20). E) Positive reaction of mAb DPJY01 cells infected with H5\u0394072N1:6PR8 (X20). F) Sequence of HA cleavage site of H5\u0394072N1:6PR8 virus indicates the presence of a low pathogenic pattern (TETR), which was created by overlapping PCR as indicated in the materials and methods and Fig. 3B. G) Plaque assay was performed as described in materials and methods.
