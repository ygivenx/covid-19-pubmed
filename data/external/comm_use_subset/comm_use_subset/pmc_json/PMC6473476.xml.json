            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne Alphavirus belongs to Togaviridae family, is transmitted through either Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito. CHIKV mediated disease is one of the global challenges due to its endemics in different parts of the world (103 countries), such as Tanzania (1\u20133), Reunion island (4\u20137), India (8\u201312), Italy (13, 14), and Thailand (15\u201318). Among Alphaviruses, CHIKV is considered as one of the most successfully evolved virus. The Arboviruses including CHIKV have been evolving and re-emerging from centuries and their emergence and dispersion are more rapid and geographically extensive. This might be due to increase in global communication, mass immigration, vector adaptation to urbanization and land perturbation (19). Even though mortality due to CHIKV is very rare and restricted to children's (below 1 year), old age (above 65 years) or immune compromised patients, the pathogenesis (mainly inflammatory responses) may persist for very long periods of time both in humans and macaque model (20, 21). Currently, arboviruses raise a serious threat to the global public health, due to unavailability of effective drugs or vaccines (22, 23).",

Studies have shown that CHIKV induces different inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (TNF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, IL-8, and MCP-1) (24, 29\u201337), which might be associated with arthritis like pathogenesis during CHIKV infection. In different in vivo systems (both mouse and non-human primates), predominant cellular infiltration of macrophages, monocytes, NK cells and T cells to the site of inoculation and other tissues have been observed (38, 39). Moreover, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry based analysis of muscles and synovial biopsies revealed that macrophages are major infiltrating cells among MPS (mononuclear phagocytic system) (25, 40). Blood monocytes and tissue macrophages are the major immune cells infected by CHIKV (21, 31, 41). In macaque, synovial macrophages have been identified as the major host cell for long-term viral persistence (21). This productive infection of CHIKV in the host macrophages might be associated with arthritis like pathogenesis despite robust immune activation (41, 42).",

Teo TH et al. have suggested that CD4+ T cells (but not CD8+ T cells) are essential for the development of CHIKV induced pathogenesis without affecting virus infection and dissemination in mice and this is independent of IFN-\u03b3 (43). Flow cytometry based analysis of circulating lymphocytes in CHIKV patients confirms that there are both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses during early and late phases of infection, respectively. Moreover, CD95 mediated apoptosis was also detected in CD4+ T cells after 2 days of symptom appearance (44), which might be one of the strategies to evade host immunity. Purified T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) from the chronic and recovered patients from 2005 to 2006 La Reunion islands showed immune activation when challenged with synthetic CHIKV peptides and inactivated virus particles (42). The DNA vaccine based on the consensus sequences of E1/2 and capsid protein (with several modifications) of CHIKV resulted in robust IFN-\u03b3 and IgG production suggesting that CHIKV induces both T and B cell specific responses (45, 46).",

In addition, activation of MAPKs by different pathogens and other inflammatory diseases have been reported to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF in the host cells (48\u201351, 53, 54). The MAPKs have been shown to be activated by phosphorylation in specific positions (Ser/Tyr/Thr) by several viral infections, such as coronavirus type 2, Hepatitis C virus, Rhinovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (54\u201358). CHIKV is also known to induce MAPKs during infection in various non-immune cells and treatment of an alkaloid berberine, reduces viral infection and joint swelling in mice (59, 60).",

Further clustering is performed within the remaining structures to generate 30 clusters. The energy minimization is done for the structures using the van der Waals terms of the CHARMM potential in the third step (64, 67), following which the structures at the center of the 10 most populated clusters are taken as the output. Since there was no satisfactory template available in PDB to build the homologous model of nsP2, the structure was generated earlier using the I-TASSER algorithm (68). This was used as a ligand in the study. X-ray crystallographic structures of JNK1 (PDB ID: 3ELJ) and p38 (PDB ID: 1A9U) were taken as receptors for the protein-protein docking. These structures were recovered from the protein data bank. The co-crystallized ligands were extracted and energy was minimized before submission of chain A of these structures as receptors. The output of docking generated four types of models using the scoring algorithms designated as balanced, electrostatic-favored, hydrophobic-favored, and van der waals+ electrostatic. Amongst these, the balanced outputs were analyzed. The docking solution with largest members was taken for further visualization using the PyMol software.",

As shown in Figure 1A, the p-p38 and p-JNK expressions were increased significantly as compared to the corresponding mock cells. The p-p38 MAPK expression was found to be increased around 1.5-fold as early as 3 and 6 hpi, followed by approximately 3-fold increments toward 12 hpi as compared to the corresponding mock cells. Similarly, the expression of the p-JNK was found to be increased rapidly around 2-fold during early hours (3 and 6 hpi), whereas, it increased up to 3-fold with respect to the mock in later time points. The total p38 and JNK (t-p38 and t-JNK) expressions remain unaffected in both the groups. Moreover, p-ERK1/2 and t-ERK1/2 (total-ERK1/2) expressions remain unchanged throughout all the time points as compared to the corresponding mock (Figures 1A,B).

First, different concentrations of both SB (0.1, 0.5 and 1.5 \u03bcM) and SP (1, 5 and 10 \u03bcM) were assessed for cytotoxicity in Raw cells by MTT assay. It was observed that around 100% cells were viable in all the concentrations of SB, whereas up to 95 and 100% cells were found to be viable at 10 and 5 \u03bcM concentrations of SP, respectively (Figures 2A,E). Thus, both 5 and 10 \u03bcM concentrations of SP were selected for further experiments. As SB treatment with >2 \u03bcM concentration was known to inhibit phosphorylation and activation of PKB non-specifically (71), both 0.5 and 1.5 \u03bcM concentrations of SB was used in the current study.",

It was observed that the percent positive cells for nsP2 were reduced from 8.19 \u00b1 0.35 (CHIKV+DMSO) to 2.50 \u00b1 0.08 (CHIKV+SB 0.5 \u03bcM) and 1.36 \u00b1 0.02 (CHIKV+SB 1.5 \u03bcM), whereas the percent positive cells for p-p38 were reduced from 8.05 \u00b1 0.73 (CHIKV+DMSO) to 1.31 \u00b1 0.15 (CHIKV+SB 0.5 \u03bcM) and 0.46 \u00b1 0.04 (CHIKV+SB 1.5 \u03bcM) (Figures 2B,C). Likewise, the MFI for both the p-p38 and nsP2 were reduced at 12 hpi in the SB treated cells as compared to the DMSO control (Figure 2D). The inhibition of p-JNK by SP at 5.0 \u03bcM concentration did not affect nsP2 expression in the macrophages as compared to the DMSO control (CHIKV+DMSO; 7.63 \u00b1 0.40, CHIKV+SP 5 \u03bcM; 7.21 \u00b1 0.17, p > 0.05), despite significant reduction in the p-JNK percent positive cells (CHIKV+DMSO; 6.08 \u00b1 0.40, CHIKV+SP; 3.31 \u00b1 0.75, p < 0.05). However, SP at the comparatively higher concentration (10 \u03bcM) did reduces nsP2 expression by around 1.5-fold (Figures 2F\u2013H). Further, plaque assay of the cell culture supernatants revealed that SB treatment reduces the number of new viral progeny release around 1.5- and 2.5-fold at 0.5 and 1.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Whereas, SP at 10 \u03bcM concentration treatment reduces the number of new viral progeny release around 1.6-fold as compared to the corresponding DMSO control (Figure 2I).

Since, CHIKV triggers robust TNF production (a key mediator of inflammation) in the host macrophages (31, 37), it was interesting to investigate whether any MAPKs are involved in this pathway. Accordingly, macrophages were treated with either SB or SP and infected with CHIKV as mentioned earlier. The cell culture supernatants were subjected to sandwich ELISA for the detection of TNF at early (6 hpi) and late (12 hpi) time post-infection. It was observed that both SB and SP could suppress CHIKV induced TNF significantly at both the time points as compared to the corresponding DMSO control. At 6 hpi the TNF level for CHIKV+DMSO was found to be 737 \u00b1 27 pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SEM), which was reduced to 466 \u00b1 12 pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SEM, p < 0.05) and 356 \u00b1 20 pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SEM, p < 0.05) in the presence of SB (1.5 \u03bcM) and SP (10.0 \u03bcM), respectively.

Recent studies have shown a pathogenic role of T cells during CHIKV infection associated to host inflammatory responses (43, 44, 46). Here we have investigated whether CHIKV infection induced macrophage derived TNF can facilitate mouse T cell activation associated with cell mediated immunity. For this, CHIKV infected culture supernatant of RAW 264.7 cells were tested toward TCR driven resting T cell activation assay (69). We have found that CHIKV infected macrophage culture supernatant along with TCR activation facilitated the induction of CD69 level (around 81%) as compared to uninfected culture supernatant (around 71%). Interestingly, when the CHIKV infected macrophage culture supernatant was treated with TNF neutralizing antibody, a sharp decrease of CD69 frequency (around 63%) was observed. Beside this, SB and SP treated CHIKV infected Raw 264.7 culture supernatant along with TCR stimulation also showed downregulation of CD69 frequency in T cells (Figures 4A,B). So, the above observations may underscore that the TNF present in CHIKV infected culture supernatant might be able to facilitate the induction of T cell activation.",

Although, several other inflammatory cytokines are elevated in RA (rheumatoid arthritis), anti-TNF therapy seems to be promising for the effective treatment against it (79). Since CHIKV induces TNF via p38/JNK MAP kinase pathways and phosphorylation of c-jun is reported to be associated with TNF production in other inflammatory model system (50, 80), phosphorylation of c-jun in both mock and CHIKV infected macrophages was assessed by Western blot analysis. Surprisingly, the expression of p-c-jun was reduced around 1.8- and 4.77-fold in the presence of SP at 5 and 10 \u03bcM indicating a plausible role of JNK toward c-jun phosphorylation, whereas SB treatment at 1.5 \u03bcM did not affect p-c-jun expression significantly. However, both SB and SP treatment suppressed p-IRF-3 expression which is induced by CHIKV as compared to the DMSO control (Figures 6A\u2013D). Taken together, the current data depict that CHIKV may induce p-c-jun via JNK pathway whereas induction of p-IRF-3 might be dependent on both p38 and JNK MAPKs.",

Very often viruses also shut-off host translational process, which might be a strategic decision to contain antiviral responses (81, 82). The integration of complex proteomics studies including in silico protein-protein interaction predictions keeps on unraveling the complex network of interaction with the host cell proteins. Throughout the course of replication, these pathways rely heavily on the dynamic and temporarily regulated virus-host protein-protein interactions which are crucial for the virus replication, pathogenesis, and viral subversion of host defense. The identification and characterization of these interacting partners also help in the delineation of the viral protein functions precisely and might be very helpful in designing rationale drugs for an effective treatment (83\u201385). The interaction of host MAPK with viral protein has been shown earlier, which in turn regulates infection and replications (86). Since CHIKV infection modulated the phosphorylation of host p38 and JNK, their interaction with the nsP2 protein was investigated. For that, Raw cells were infected with CHIKV and harvested at 6 hpi for further analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis showed that both the p-p38 and p-JNK proteins were pulled with the CHIKV-nsP2 protein in the host macrophages (Figures 7A,B). This result indicates that CHIKV-nsP2 interacts with both p-p38 and p-JNK and this might be playing a crucial role in the CHIKV infection and TNF mediated inflammatory responses.",

The balanced outputs were preferred from the docking results as this mode takes into account all possible modes of interactions. The most stable complex of nsP2-JNK1 on visualization by using the PyMol software suggested the possible involvement of different residues in the interaction (Supplementary Table S1). No interaction was found between the phosphorylation lip (Thr-183-X-Tyr-185) of JNK1 and nsP2 (Figure 8A). This suggests a poor fit of JNK1 active site with nsP2. Nonetheless, ten polar interactions were observed within 2\u00e5 (Figure 8B). Some of these include the interactions of Met-182, Arg-228, Arg-189, Val-196, Arg-150, Lys-68, and Glu-346 of JNK1 with Cys-217, Arg-272, Gln-291, Gly-279, Asp-280, Gly-285, and Lys-282 of nsP2, respectively (Figure 8B). The most stable complex of nsP2-p38 showed a close fit of the phosphorylation lip (Thr-180-X-Tyr-182). In addition to that, a polar interaction was suggested between Thr-180 of p38 and Gln-273 of nsP2 (Figure 8C). Some of the polar interactions were also observed between Lys-66, Ser-329, Asn-196, Ser-252, Ser-254, Asp-177, Glu-178, Arg-173, Lys-152, and Asp-230 of p38 and Asn-288, Gly-285, Asp-280, Cys-278, Asp-351, Cys-257, Arg-244, Phe-255, Arg-272, and Thr-90 of nsP2, respectively (Figure 8D and Supplementary Table S2). Thus, these results further suggest that CHIKV-nsP2 interacts with p38 as well as JNK MAPKs during viral infection in the host macrophages. Moreover, the phosphorylation lip of p38 interacts more closely with the Gln-273 of CHIKV-nsP2, which supports the findings of IP experiments.",

TNF is one of the robustly induced cytokine by CHIKV and in the current study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the induction of TNF in the host macrophages. Our data suggested that CHIKV induces both p38 and JNK phosphorylation in macrophages in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, p-p38 and p-JNK inhibition by SB and SP were found to reduce CHIKV infection. Interestingly, SB mediated inhibition of CHIKV infection was found to be more effective even at lower concentration as compared to SP. Further, inhibition of both p-p38 and p-JNK reduced CHIKV induced TNF in the host macrophages. Moreover, CHIKV infected cell culture supernatant is found to facilitates T cell activation via TNF in TCR primed T cells. Besides, it was observed that the expressions of key transcription factors involved mainly in antiviral responses (p-IRF3) and TNF production (p-c-jun) were induced significantly in the CHIKV infected macrophages as compared to the corresponding mock cells. Further, it was found that CHIKV mediated TNF production in the macrophages is dependent on p38 and JNK MAPK pathways linking p-c-jun transcription factor. Interestingly, it was also noticed that CHIKV nsP2 interacts with host p-p38 and p-JNK MAPKs in the macrophages. This observation was supported by the in silico protein-protein docking analysis which illustrates the specific amino acids responsible for the nsP2-MAPKs interactions and a strong polar interaction was predicted between Thr-180 (within the phosphorylation lip) of p38 and Gln-273 of nsP2. However, no such polar interaction was predicted for the phosphorylation lip of JNK which indicates the differential roles of p-p38 and p-JNK during CHIKV infection in the host macrophages.",

Here, it was observed that the expression of p-c-jun is dependent on p-JNK pathway (as SP reduces p-c-jun expression in a dose dependent manner), whereas induction of p-IRF3 is dependent on both MAPKs (p38 and JNK) during CHIKV infection in macrophages. Therefore, it is quite possible that the p-JNK pathway induction by CHIKV leads to the activation of antiviral responses via p-IRF3 and pro-inflammatory responses (TNF) via p-c-jun pathway. On the other hand, p-p38 is involved in activating both pro-viral and anti-viral pathways (via induction of p-IRF3) (Figure 9). It has also been observed during this investigation that pro-inflammatory TNF production was decreased significantly during SB treatment. This might be due to the marked inhibition of CHIKV infection, however the possibilities of the involvement of other factors cannot be ignored.",

In mouse model system, it has been demonstrated that host T cells are induced during experimental CHIKV infection and are associated with CHIKV mediated pathogenesis (43, 44, 46). In the present study, we found that CHIKV infected macrophage culture supernatant may facilitate TCR driven activation of resting T cells as compared to the mock supernatant. Further, the use of neutralizing anti-TNF antibody towards the regulation of the T cell activation suggests that it could be mediated via CHIKV induced macrophage derived TNF. Additionally, presence of either SB or SP in the CHIKV infected macrophage supernatant also able to reduce T cell activation in vitro, indicating an effect of macrophage derived TNF on T cell activation during CHIKV infection. Except few cases, CHIKV is not fatal, however, the long-term polyarthralgia, arthritis-like symptoms along with severe inflammation remain a concern for most of the chronic patients (20, 25, 92\u201395). TNF is one of the key mediator of arthritis or arthritis-like diseases in humans by triggering severe inflammation. Despite the elevation of several other inflammatory cytokines in RA, anti-TNF therapy holds a promise for the effective treatment against it (96, 97), which might be exploited against CHIKV pathogenesis in future.",

This was also supported by the in silico analysis of the protein-protein interaction of CHIKV-nsP2 with p38 and JNK. The phosphorylation lip of p38 was found to interact with nsP2 due to the observed close fit model and a polar interaction between Thr-180 of p38 and Gln-273 of nsP2. Residues from the N-terminus of nsP2 were also suggested to have strong (<2 \u00c5) polar interactions with the other residues around this active site. Unlike this, the interaction of CHIKV-nsP2 showed poor fit with the phosphorylation lip of JNK and close (<2 \u00c5) polar interaction was also observed for residues from N-terminus of nsP2.

However, the precise role of the viral protein phosphorylation (especially in Alphavirus) has not been reported yet. In this investigation, nsP2 was found to interact with the phosphorylation lip of p38, hence, in silico analysis was carried out using PTM prediction tools, GPS (group-based phosphorylation scoring method) (101, 102) and NetPhos 3.1, to predict the target phosphorylation sites of nsP2 in a kinase specific manner (103). The GPS is a group-based phosphorylation algorithm, which predicts kinase-specific phosphorylation sites among different host protein kinase groups according to specific sequence pattern (101, 102). Whereas, the NetPhos server is based on an artificial neuronal network (ANN) that allows the users to choose between generic predictions based on the given protein sequence or kinase-specific predictions (103, 104). Out of several predictions, both the softwares predicted T5, S28, and S513 sites in CHIKV-nsP2 with a high probability of phosphorylation by p38 (Supplementary Table S3). Further, to elucidate whether positions of these amino acids in CHIKV-nsP2 is associated with any consensus regions of functional importance, the predicted peptides were searched in the ExPASY-PROSITE protein database. Surprisingly, the peptide \u201cFKEDKAYSPEVALNE\u201d with S513 (at the middle, red) showed a hit with Alphavirus nsP2 protease domain belonging to the C9 cysteine protease family (105). Since we have shown earlier that p38 interacts strongly with CHIKV nsP2 (with phosphorylation lip) and the inhibition of p38 activation strongly reduces CHIKV infection, it might be possible that, p38 phosphorylates either nsP2 directly or through the association of other client protein(s) which in turn may modulate its function. However, further studies are required to corroborate the CHIKV-nsP2 phosphorylation by host kinases and its functional consequences on infection and pathogenesis.",
