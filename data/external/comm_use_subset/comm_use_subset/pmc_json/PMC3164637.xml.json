Chlamydia alternate between an extracellular, spore-like infectious form termed the elementary body (EB), and an intracellular, metabolically active but non-infectious form termed the reticulate body (RB). Infection is initiated by binding of the EB to the host cell where it is taken up by an actin and Rho family GTPase-dependent process and sequestered within a unique membrane bound compartment called the inclusion [4]. Subsequently, the EB differentiates into an RB and replicates by binary fission within the inclusion. Concomitantly, the bacteria begin remodeling the inclusion membrane by insertion of bacterial proteins that promote segregation of the inclusion from the classical endosomal/lysosomal transport pathway, that facilitate interactions of the inclusion with the exocytic transport pathway, and that promote migration of the inclusion along microtubules to the peri-Golgi region [5], [6]. The developing inclusion expands to accommodate increasing numbers of bacteria and is stabilized by recruitment of host cytoskeletal structures primarily composed of F-actin and intermediate filaments [7]. After 24\u201372 hours (hrs) of replication, RBs redifferentiate back to EBs and are released from the host cells by cell lysis or active extrusion [8].",

            "text": "\nChlamydiae are one of the few known bacterial pathogens that require host-derived membrane lipids, including sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol, for intracellular growth and development [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Recent work suggests that SM biosynthesis is also required for homotypic fusion of multiple inclusions within the same cell as well as for inclusion membrane stability [15]. Chlamydia are thought to acquire SM by vesicular trafficking via multiple routes, including (1) the interception of SM-containing Golgi-derived exocytic vesicles destined for the plasma membrane (PM) [16], [17], [18], (2) fusion with multivesicular body (MVB)-derived vesicles [15], [19], [20], and/or (3) Golgi fragmentation [21], [22]. SM acquisition by the inclusion is observed as early as 2 hrs post infection (hpi), with incorporation of SM into the inclusion membrane and into the bacterial cell wall [6], [10], [12], [13], [15], [19], [20], [23]. Golgi fragmentation induced by C. trachomatis has been shown to play an important role in SM acquisition during the later stages of infection and may be required for subsequent fusion with exocytic vesicles by a mechanism that involves Rab6 and Rab11 [21], [22]. SM transport to the inclusion is partially abrogated by Brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of vesicular transport [6], [24], [25] and is accompanied by a decrease in inclusion size [6], indicating that SM transport to the inclusion via vesicular trafficking is important for inclusion growth. Importantly, BFA treatment has no effect on bacterial replication [6], suggesting that SM acquisition by a BFA-sensitive pathway is not essential for replication and that C. trachomatis may acquire SM by additional routes that involve BFA-insensitive and/or non-vesicular trafficking pathways.",

            "text": "ADP ribosylation factors (Arfs) are small GTPases that are key players in the regulation of vesicular transport where they function to recruit coat proteins necessary for vesicle formation (reviewed in [26]). Arf1 is localized in all three Golgi compartments, cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi, and cycles between an active GTP bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form [27]. Arf1 activation is spatially and temporally regulated by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GBF1 (Golgi-specific BFA resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1) and BIG1/BIG2 (BFA-inhibited guanine nucleotide exchange proteins 1 and 2) which are present in the cis- and trans-Golgi, respectively [26], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. BFA inhibits the activation of Arf1 by targeting GBF1 and BIGs [29], [34], [35], [36]. GBF1 is required for the assembly and maintenance of the Golgi stack whereas BIGs are required for maintenance of the trans-Golgi network [33], [37]. Besides regulating coat protein recruitment, Arf1 controls the actin cytoskeleton by modulating the lipid microenvironment via recruitment of various phosphoinositide kinases [38], and it also regulates the vimentin architecture in cells [39]. Although Arf1 localizes to the inclusion and has recently been implicated in Chlamydia infection [40], [41], the specific roles of Arf1 and its cis- and trans-Golgi-specific GEFS in inclusion biogenesis and/or acquisition of SM has not been previously investigated.",

            "text": "Until recently, vesicular trafficking of ceramide from the ER to the trans-Golgi was believed to be essential for SM biosynthesis; however, it is now appreciated that the major pathway of de novo SM biosynthesis involves a cytosolic lipid transfer protein, called CERT, that transports ceramide (the precursor for SM) from the ER directly to the trans-Golgi, where it is converted to SM by one of two SM synthases, SMS1 or SMS2 [42], [43], [44], [45], [46]. CERT has three functional domains, an N-terminal PH (pleckstrin homology) domain that binds phosphoinositide-4-phosphate (PI4P) at the trans-Golgi, a FFAT (two phenylalanines in an acidic tract) motif that binds integral membrane proteins, VAP-A and VAP-B, at the ER, and a C-terminal START (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer) domain that binds to and extracts ceramide from the ER membrane [47]. CERT is subjected to regulation within a serine repeat (SR) domain where phosphorylation by Protein Kinase D and hyperphosphorylation by Casein Kinase I\u03b32 (CKI\u03b32) inactivates CERT while dephosphorylation by Protein Phosphatase 2C\u03b5 activates CERT [48], [49], [50]. Transfer of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi via CERT is thought to occur at ER-Golgi membrane contact sites (MCS), sub-regions of the ER located very close to trans-Golgi stacks [51], [52]. The role of non-vesicular lipid transport pathways during Chlamydia infection has not been previously explored.",

We found that C. trachomatis selectively co-opts GBF1 within the cis-Golgi compartment for vesicle-mediated SM acquisition and that this source of SM contributes to inclusion membrane growth and stability but that GBF1 function is not required for bacterial replication. Unexpectedly, we discovered that C. trachomatis coordinates recruitment of CERT and SM synthases to the inclusion and that subversion of this lipid synthesis pathway is required for bacterial replication and for efficient SM acquisition by C. trachomatis. We propose that C. trachomatis utilizes separate lipid trafficking pathways to acquire SM for distinct roles during infection: SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability while CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication.",

We found that GBF1 and BIG1 were localized to the fragmented Golgi around the inclusion in C. trachomatis-infected cells and appeared to maintain their cis and trans polarity, as observed in uninfected cells (Figure 1A). GBF1 (Figure 1B) and BIG1 (data not shown) were primarily localized adjacent to but not on the inclusion membrane. Similar results were obtained in cells expressing GFP-tagged GBF1 (data not shown). In contrast, Arf1-GFP was found not only on Golgi vesicles adjacent to the inclusion but was also localized to the inclusion membrane, where it formed a thin rim of circumferential staining (Figure 1B), consistent with previously published results [40], [41]. We noted a striking concentration of Arf1-GFP at the region of two closely apposed inclusion membranes (Figure 1B). To evaluate whether GBF1 or BIG1/2 activity was required for Arf1-GFP recruitment to the inclusion membrane, we treated cells with BFA, which inhibits both GBF1 and BIGs, and examined the localization Arf1-GFP and GBF1. Exposure of the cells to BFA resulted in dispersion of GBF1 and Arf1-GFP throughout the cell and loss of the circumferential rim staining on the inclusion; however, BFA had no effect on Arf1-GFP localization at abutting inclusion membranes (Figure 1B). This finding suggests that GBF1 and/or BIG1/2 activities are required for Arf1 recruitment to the outer region of the inclusion but that they are not necessary for Arf1 maintenance at closely apposed inclusions.",

Protein depletion was assessed by western blot analysis (Figure 1C).

In contrast, depletion of GBF1 resulted in \u223c60% reduction in SM acquisition by the inclusion (Figures 1D and S1A; p<0.001).

Although it has been reported that inhibition of SM biosynthesis did not result in alteration of the vimentin or actin structure around the inclusion [15], experiments using BFA have revealed that perturbations in vesicular trafficking lead to reciprocal changes in the architecture of the vimentin network in the host cell, indicating a tight link between membrane trafficking and the cytoskeleton [39]. Furthermore, Arf1 has been shown to regulate actin dynamics at Golgi membranes [54]. We therefore considered whether the loss of inclusion integrity observed upon disruption of GBF1 function was due solely to the decrease in SM acquisition or whether disruption of GBF1 function also affected the vimentin and actin cage surrounding the inclusion. We examined the localization of these cytoskeletal proteins in infected cells treated with GBF1 siRNA or GCA. Disruption of GBF1 function caused both the vimentin and actin cages to collapse to a thin, hemispheric cup-like structure on the nuclear side of the inclusion (Figures 2B, S2B, and S2C). In cells treated with either BFA or GCA, we also observed less GBF1 staining surrounding the inclusion, and GBF1 displayed a more compact Golgi-like localization (Figure S2A). GBF1 inhibited cells were more sensitive to Triton extraction (data not shown), similar to what has been reported following disruption of the actin and vimentin cage during infection [7], suggesting that the cytoskeletal cage is compromised upon GBF1 inhibition.",

We first examined the localization of CERT during C. trachomatis infection of HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with CERT-GFP. In uninfected cells, CERT-GFP preferentially localized to the Golgi as well as to punctate, vesicle-like structures outside the Golgi (Figure S4 and [45], [55]), which are thought to be ER-derived (K. Kumagai and K. Hanada, personal communication). In C. trachomatis-infected cells, CERT-GFP was recruited to the inclusion, exhibiting a non-homogeneous, patchy distribution on the inclusion membrane surface (Figure 3A, B, D, E, Video S1). CERT-GFP appeared on the same plane as but distinct from localization of the C. trachomatis inclusion membrane protein, IncA (Figure 3B). This pattern of CERT recruitment to the inclusion was confirmed using an antibody to endogenous CERT (Figure S3), demonstrating that localization was not an artifact of ectopic expression. CERT-GFP also localized to C. trachomatis serovar D inclusions (Figure 3B), suggesting that the recruitment to the inclusion was not serovar-specific. CERT-GFP was recruited to inclusions as early as 2 hpi, where nascent inclusions were enveloped by CERT-GFP-containing vesicles that partially overlapped with p58, a marker of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Figure S4A).",

Previous work suggests that there is an intimate association of the ER with the chlamydial inclusion [57], [58]. We examined the localization of CERT and VAP-A by co-expressing CERT-GFP and HcRed-VAP-A [45] in infected cells and found that HcRed-VAP-A colocalized with CERT-GFP at the inclusion at 2, 8, and 24 hpi (Figures 3C\u2013E). These results suggest that CERT may function to bring the ER membrane in close apposition to the inclusion or that VAP-A is recruited directly to the inclusion.",

In addition or alternatively, as CERT and VAP-A are also localized at the inclusion, CERT may be directly involved in C. trachomatis infection by mediating the transfer of a portion of host ceramide from the nearby ER directly to the inclusion. We examined the localization of ceramide in infected cells expressing CERT-GFP using a ceramide antibody. This antibody does not cross-react with SM, cholesterol, or other phospholipids under physiologic in vivo conditions [65]. Ceramide appeared to be highly enriched in the region adjacent to the inclusion in what is likely to be the surrounding ER (Figure S5). Importantly, we also found that a fraction of ceramide localized at the inclusion membrane as evidence by co-staining with IncA antibodies and Arf1-GFP (Figure S5A and S5B). Although we found ceramide in close association with CERT-GFP at the inclusion membrane, ceramide and CERT-GFP did not overlap on the inclusion membrane (Figure S5C), possibly reflecting conversion of ceramide to SM and loss of reactivity with the ceramide antibody. Taken together, these results indicate that CERT is required for C. trachomatis replication and that interference with CERT correlates with a block in the SM acquisition by the inclusion. In addition, the localization of ceramide during infection suggests that CERT may be functioning at the Golgi as well as at the inclusion.",

We were particularly interested in the PH domain, as recent studies have shown that multiple proteins that regulate PI4P metabolism are recruited to the inclusion, including OCLR (oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe protein 1) and the PI4P kinases, PI4KII\u03b1 and to a lesser extent PI4KII\u03b2 [40]. The presence of PI4P at the inclusion combined with our finding that VAP-A colocalizes with CERT at the inclusion (Figures 3C\u20133E) raises the possibility that CERT could be recruited to the inclusion by its interaction with PI4P and/or with VAP-A.",

While CERT-GFP and CERT (D324A)-GFP show some Golgi localization during infection, none is observed for CERT (G67E)-GFP (Figure 6A). Co-staining with antibodies to Calnexin, an ER marker, revealed that although the ER appears in close proximity to the inclusion, it does not overlap with CERT-WT, D324A, or G67E at the inclusion (Figure S6). CERT was still recruited to inclusions formed in a mutant cell line of Chinese hamster ovary cells, LY-A, which carries a mutation in the PH domain of endogenous CERT (G67E) (Figure S3) [43], [66]. Despite the fact that LY-A cells have reduced SM biosynthesis [43], [66], SM acquisition by C. trachomatis inclusions was normal in these cells (data not shown).",

C. trachomatis-infected HeLa cells were treated with Exo1, a specific inhibitor of Arf GTPase activity [68], from 1 to 24 hpi, and CERT-GFP localization was examined at 24 hpi. Although quantitation of inclusion size in Exo1 treated cells revealed a \u223c64% decrease (p<0.001), Exo1 had no effect on CERT recruitment to the inclusion (Figure 6B). Together, these results indicate that interaction with PI4P, VAP-A, or Arf1 alone is not essential for CERT recruitment to the inclusion, though PI4P, VAP-A, or Arf1 binding may function redundantly or there may be other determinants within CERT. In addition, CERT-GFP was still recruited to inclusions in cells treated with GCA, BFA, or Nocodazole, which disrupts microtubules (Figures S4B and 7C), indicating that GBF1 function, vesicular trafficking, and microtubules are not required for CERT recruitment.",

We therefore tested whether SMS2 recruitment to the inclusion required palmitoylation by examining the localization of a C-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged SMS2 construct in which all four of the potential palmitoylation sites were mutated (C331, 332, 343, 348A) [69].

Our observation that SMS2 but not SMS1 is recruited to the inclusion membrane prompted us to determine their relative contributions to infection. Cells were depleted of SMS1 or SMS2 by siRNA [56] for 72 hrs and subsequently infected with C. trachomatis for 24 hrs. The efficiency of depletion was verified by western blot analysis in cells expressing C-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged SMS1 and 3xFLAG-tagged SMS2 (Figure 8A). Loss of SMS1 activity was confirmed by demonstrating decreased accumulation of BODIPY FL-Ceramide and BODIPY FL-SM at the Golgi apparatus (Figure 8B) [56]. Depletion of either SMS1 or SMS2 resulted in a significant reduction in relative inclusion size and progeny formation (Figures 8C\u2013D). These results demonstrate that both SMS1 and SMS2 contribute to C. trachomatis replication and inclusion growth. Our results support the hypothesis that at least a portion of SM acquired by C. trachomatis may be directly synthesized on the inclusion membrane. In addition, SM synthesized at the nearby Golgi by SMS1 and SMS2 transported by a BFA-insensitive pathway may also contribute to replication.",

For example, Legionella pneumophila replicates within a vacuole that is closely associated with the ER, while Salmonella and Mycobacteria species replicate within compartments that have characteristics of endosomes [70]. Chlamydiae are among the few known pathogens that occupy an exocytic compartment from which they acquire host-derived nutrients, including SM and cholesterol [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. While previous work supports a role for canonical vesicular trafficking in the acquisition of SM by Chlamydia from the host, it has remained a mystery as to why inhibitors of vesicular trafficking have no effect on Chlamydia replication, given that host SM biosynthesis is necessary for bacterial replication [6], [12]. Here, we demonstrate that C. trachomatis co-opts key proteins involved in both vesicular and non-vesicular lipid trafficking pathways to acquire SM for distinct roles during infection, providing an intriguing explanation for this apparent paradox. We found that C. trachomatis recruits CERT, its ER binding partner VAP-A, and SM synthases to establish an on-site SM biosynthetic factory at or near the inclusion that is critical for C. trachomatis replication. In addition, we show that C. trachomatis co-opts the function of GBF1, a regulator of Arf1-dependent vesicular trafficking within the early secretory pathway, to further provide SM. This source of SM contributes to inclusion membrane growth and stability but is not essential for bacterial replication.",

While these treatments decrease SM biosynthesis and would thus be expected to affect C. trachomatis replication, unexpectedly and most remarkably, we found that CERT was recruited to the inclusion membrane. Our results are consistent with two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms by which CERT could promote SM acquisition during infection (Figure 9). CERT could transport ceramide directly from the ER to the inclusion, where this lipid would serve as a substrate for inclusion membrane localized SMS2, allowing SM biosynthesis to proceed on the inclusion membrane (Figure 9, step A). SM would then be transferred from the inclusion membrane to intracellular RBs. Alternatively, or in addition, by virtue of its ability to bind to the ER and to the Golgi, CERT could help to coordinate recruitment of these organelles to the inclusion (Figure 9, step B). This process would bring the trans-Golgi localized SMS1 and SMS2 in close proximity to the ER and to the inclusion, thereby promoting efficient SM synthesis in the vicinity of the inclusion. Since CERT cannot transport SM [44], it is likely that this source of SM is subsequently transferred to the inclusion by a BFA-insensitive vesicular trafficking pathway. It is also possible that SM could be transferred from the Golgi at MCS to the inclusion by one of several mechanisms involving non-vesicular lipid exchange between membranes, such as transient hemifusion and/or stochastic collision with the Golgi [71].",

In contrast to SMS1, inclusion membrane localized SMS2 and CERT are not disrupted by BFA, GCA, or Nocodazole, which may explain why bacterial replication is not affected by these drugs. We note that it is difficult by current methods to demonstrate that SM is synthesized directly on the inclusion, since SM can also arrive via vesicular trafficking [46], [56]. We speculate that by preferentially recruiting SMS2 over SMS1 during infection, C. trachomatis ensures a source of SM for itself without placing a huge burden on the host's ability to synthesize SM since SMS1 would still be active at the Golgi. Future studies will be required to unravel how SMS2 is recruited to the inclusion membrane.",

Although the recruitment of CERT to Golgi and ER membranes requires the PH and FFAT domains, respectively [47], we found that only the ceramide binding and/or ceramide transfer activity of CERT is required for its recruitment to the inclusion. While CKI\u03b32-induced phosphorylation of CERT inhibits its activity, CERT was still recruited to the inclusion, presumably because CERT is still able to bind ceramide. On the other hand, exposure to HPA-12 prevented CERT recruitment to the inclusion, possibly through its known ability to inhibit interaction of the START domain with membranes in vitro\n[60]. An alternative scenario is that HPA-12 binding to CERT could alter its ability to bind PI4P, VAP-A, or potentially a bacterial factor at the inclusion membrane through steric hindrance or conformational change. We favor the hypothesis that CERT binds to ceramide at the ER, prior to its recruitment to the inclusion, and subsequently interacts with the inclusion by an as yet to be identified bacterial or host protein. It is also possible that a small amount of ceramide and/or VAP-A may initially be incorporated into the inclusion membrane from either the plasma membrane during endocytosis or by fusion with the ER or ER-derived vesicles containing ceramide, which would then promote CERT recruitment. These initial events could then set up an amplification mechanism for subsequent ceramide transfer and SM synthesis. Further studies are needed to determine whether CERT transfer activity or ceramide binding alone is necessary for its recruitment to the inclusion, and whether either of these functions cooperates with a bacterial protein present in the inclusion membrane.",

Loss of SM acquisition following inhibition of GBF1 function correlated with a loss of inclusion membrane integrity and alterations in the localization of actin and vimentin cytoskeletal components surrounding the inclusion (Figure 9, step D). Whether the loss of inclusion integrity is a direct or indirect consequence of the collapse of the closely associated cytoskeletal cage or whether it results from the loss of SM acquisition, as suggested by Beatty and coworkers [15], remains to be determined.

            "text": "We observed that GBF1 and Arf1 have little overlap at the inclusion membrane during infection even though they extensively colocalize at the Golgi surrounding the inclusion. This observation could reflect a transient and dynamic interaction at the inclusion. Alternatively, we favor the hypothesis that GBF1 activates Arf1 at the Golgi and then Arf1-vesicles containing SM traffic to and fuse with the inclusion. Under these circumstances, GBF1-dependent activation of Arf1 at the Golgi rather than at the inclusion would be important, which could explain why there is little colocalization of these proteins at the inclusion. Consistent with this notion, we found that inhibition of GBF1 activity resulted in a loss of inclusion localized Arf1, except at the region of abutting inclusion membranes. This finding suggests that GBF1 is required for Arf1 recruitment to the outer region of the inclusion but not for Arf1 maintenance at closely apposed inclusions. We are currently investigating the role of Arf1 at this region.",

In contrast to these pathogens where depletion or inhibition of GBF1 by BFA significantly impairs replication, our findings demonstrate that GBF1 is more important for establishing a stable intracellular niche in which C. trachomatis replicates. Both poliovirus and coxsackievirus encode a protein (3A) that binds to and co-opts GBF1 function, while L. pneumophila secretes into the cell RalF, an Arf GEF, that regulates Arf1 localization to the L. pneumophila-containing phagosome [78], [79]. Since GBF1 was not localized on the inclusion membrane, it is possible that GBF1 communicates indirectly with the inclusion through a variety of host proteins or lipids that have been shown to bind GBF1 and that localize at or near the inclusion, including Rab1 [80], PI4P [81], and the Golgi matrix proteins, golgin 84 and p115 [26]. It will be important to determine whether the alterations in the actin and vimentin cytoskeleton during infection are directly or indirectly modulated by GBF1.",

We hypothesize that SM acquired by CERT-dependent transport of ceramide and subsequent conversion to SM is necessary for C. trachomatis replication whereas SM acquired by the GBF1-dependent pathway is essential for inclusion growth and stability. Together, these observations provide an intriguing explanation for why inhibition of vesicular trafficking alone fails to affect intracellular replication. Moreover, our results describe the first example of a bacterial pathogen to co-opt CERT and reveal a novel strategy by which this organism creates its own SM biosynthetic factory. This work has identified novel targets that may prove useful in combating Chlamydia infections.",

To quantify primary inclusion formation, cells were fixed and processed by immunofluorescence and processed as described below. To quantify production of infectious progeny, infected cells were scraped into media, lysed with sonication, and 5-fold serial dilutions were used to infect fresh HeLa monolayers that had been plated on coverslips for 24 hrs. For assessment of drug effects on bacterial viability and internalization, progeny was harvested from DMSO treated samples and left untreated or treated with the various inhibitors during the 1 hr infection of fresh HeLa monolayers. Cells were then washed free of the inhibitor and incubated for an additional 24 hrs. Inclusions were visualized by immunofluorescence with goat anti-MOMP antibodies and donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 or mouse anti-Chlamydia FITC conjugate. Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) from a minimum of 10 fields per sample. The relative inclusion forming units (IFUs) were expressed as a percentage of control siRNA or DMSO controls. The data is presented as mean \u00b1 standard error. To quantify the relative size of inclusions, approximately 200\u2013350 cells were counted from 7\u201310 fields, the inclusion area analyzed by Metamorph using the mean area function, and the data is normalized to the percent area of control siRNA or DMSO-treated cells. To quantify inclusion disruption, approximately 350 cells were scored for apparent breaks in the inclusion membrane by staining with 14-3-3\u03b2 and for concomitant release of bacteria into the cytosol. The data is normalized to percentage of similarly scored control or DMSO-treated cells.",

To assess SM accumulation in the Golgi upon depletion of CERT or SMS1, BODIPY FL-Ceramide labeling was performed at 72 hrs post siRNA treatment and fluorescence intensity in the Golgi region of siRNA-treated samples was compared to control siRNA. To assess SM accumulation by the inclusion upon depletion and inhibition of GBF1 and BIGs, cells were treated with the appropriate siRNA for 72 hrs, infected with L2, and BODIPY FL-Ceramide labeling was performed at 24 hpi. For quantitation of SM accumulation in the inclusion, mean fluorescence intensity of the inclusion was determined by defining regions of interest within the inclusion and dividing by the mean fluorescence intensity of the nucleus, which remained constant with all drug treatments.
