The World Health Organization identified the source of the disease as SARS-CoV coronavirus on April 16, 2003.4\u20136 A total of 5327 individuals were diagnosed with SARS in China, and 349 patients died.7 In Beijing, SARS first broke out in Peking University People\u2019s Hospital, where 80 medical staff contracted the virus, two of whom died subsequently. This cohort became the largest patient population worldwide and was composed of healthcare workers infected during their employment. Under the guidance on managing infectious diseases, Peking University People\u2019s Hospital was isolated by the government for 22 days. The main clinical manifestation after infection was high fever and severe lung inflammation.5,6 The patients who survived had residual pulmonary fibrosis as well as osteonecrosis resulting from treatment with large doses of steroid pulse therapy. Several studies have investigated the long-term outcomes of recovered SARS patients, especially with respect to lung and bone damage, but no follow-up periods of more than 7 years have been reported. We conducted a comprehensive 15-year follow-up of healthcare workers with nosocomial SARS to evaluate their health utility after rehabilitation and obtain a new understanding of the associated pulmonary damage and femoral head necrosis.",

Das et al. followed up 55 patients with MERS pneumonia, analyzed imaging variations within 1 year after rehabilitation, and found that the most common type of lesion was ground-glass changes in the periphery of the lung.12 Chen et al. followed up 56 patients with H7N9 avian influenza to analyze pulmonary function and imaging changes within 2 years after infection.13 The results showed that despite interstitial changes and fibrosis on imaging, ventilation and diffusion dysfunction improved to some extent after 6 months; however, recovered patients experienced impaired pulmonary function over those 2 years. In a cohort of 48 H1N1 pneumonia cases, Liu et al. found that patients who showed mild to moderate pulmonary dysfunction manifested with diffusion disorder (33.3%) and small airway dysfunction (33.3%).14 Wu et al. at the Beijing Friendship Hospital found that the lesions on CT scans of 11 SARS patients both 6 months and 84 months after rehabilitation clearly diminished compared with those seen at 3 months.15 Ground-glass opacity (GGO) lesions were dominant at 6 months, while intralobular and interlobular septum thickening were prominent at 84 months. Dundamadappa et al. acquired high-resolution CT scans of 65 SARS patients at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. The initial scan of 28 patients (45.9%) showed normal scarring and fibrosis (parenchyma and stroma).16 That study concluded that persistent GGOs may be characterized by fibrosis rather than alveolar inflammation. Ong et al. evaluated the pulmonary function and health utility of 94 patients 1 year after being rehabilitated from SARS.17 The outcomes showed that 63% of the patients maintained normal lung function, with slightly reduced FEV1/FVC values in 5% of patients and moderately a reduced FVC value in one case. Of these patients, 18% and 3% had mildly and moderately impaired diffusion function, respectively.",

            "text": "To date, no imaging data of lung injury in SARS patients have been reported internationally with a follow-up period of over 5 years. We conducted a cohort study of 80 healthcare workers who were infected with nosocomial SARS at Peking University People\u2019s Hospital in 2003. With radiology examinations, we distinguished GGO and strip-like consolidation on CT scans and calculated the percentage of areas with different lesions. Our study is the first to describe the recovery curve of lung injury in SARS patients over the past 15 years. We found that the percentage of lesions rapidly decreased from 2003 to 2004 and plateaued from 2004 to 2018. These results suggest that SARS-induced pulmonary lesions visualized with imaging recovered to a greater extent within 1 year after rehabilitation. These results indicated that there was a correlation between pulmonary CT images and functional changes. Thus far, there has been no report on the pulmonary function in SARS patients during a follow-up period of over 2 years on the global scale. Our study showed that the pulmonary function in 2018 was basically the same as that in 2006, with mildly impaired diffusion function. Although there was no substantial recovery, we should take the natural degeneration of pulmonary function over the past 15 years into consideration. In addition, the pulmonary function of patients who had normal findings on CT after recovering from SARS in 2003 was substantially better than that of patients with abnormalities. This implies that pulmonary function could be improved to a larger extent when the acute phase of infectious viral pneumonia is effectively managed. This finding has great value in judging and predicting the prognosis of viral pneumonia.",

Our study, as far as we know, is the first to report that the status of femoral head necrosis caused by high-dose steroid pulse therapy to treat infectious viral pneumonia could remain stable over the long term and that femoral head necrosis could even become reversible. This phenomena clearly differs from the progression of femoral head necrosis caused by long-term steroid administration for other diseases (e.g., leukemia, nephrotic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis).20 Despite limited weight-bearing protocols and having an improved blood supply, femoral head necrosis induced by long-term steroid administration for leukemia, nephropathy and rheumatoid arthritis was always progressive and irreversible and ultimately led to worsened necrosis and subsequent collapse of the femoral head.21,22 Loss of joint function and arthritis were inevitable consequences. ARCO stage II femoral head necrosis progressed to stage III over a follow-up ranging from 2 months to 3 years (average 17 months), collapsed within 3\u201316 months (average 11 months), and progressed to stage IV with arthritis within 6 years.23 Shimuzu et al. reported that it took an average of 33 months to progress from stage I lesions to stage III and 49 months from stage I to stage IV.24 Wei et al. reported that steroid-induced femoral head necrosis in stage I progressed to stage IV after 24 months.25",

Our study is the first to describe the variation curve of femoral head necrosis of SARS patients over a period of 15 years by measuring the volume on continuous MRI images. The results showed that the volume of osteonecrosis in 15 patients substantially decreased, demonstrating an overall tendency toward improvement. Over the past 15 years, femoral head necrosis in the cohort recovered rapidly between 2003 and 2005, with a slower pace between 2005 and 2012, and reached a plateau from 2012 to 2018. The hip function questionnaire showed that 29 (72.5%) patients remained stable over 15 years, with limited hip function in seven (17.5%) patients, while four (10%) developed arthritis accompanied with poor mobility. These outcomes show that the limited hip joint function progressed slowly.
