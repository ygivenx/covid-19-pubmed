These mechanisms can be informed by genome-wide experiments that provide data on variations in molecular and cellular states in genotyped individuals. Most examples of such data, though, are largely observational, due in part to constraints of specific populations (e.g., humans), the limitations of existing experimental technologies, and the challenge of coordinating large numbers of experiments with multiple levels of data [2]. One approach to shed light on these dynamics is to pair complementary datasets from the same individuals and perform statistical mediation analysis (e.g., [3\u20135]), which has increasingly been used in genomics [6]. These analyses can identify putative causal relationships rather than correlational interactions, providing meaningful and actionable targets in terms of downstream applications in areas such as medicine and agriculture.",

Towards this end, genetically-diverse mouse population resources have been established, including the Collaborative Cross (CC) [17\u201319] and the Diversity Outbred (DO) population [20]. The CC and the DO are multiparental populations (MPP), derived from the same eight founder strains (short names in parentheses): A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/H1LtJ (NZO), CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). The CC are recombinant inbred strains and therefore replicable across and within studies; the DO are largely heterozygous, outbred animals, bred with a random mating strategy that seeks to maximize diversity. MPPs similar to the CC or DO have also been developed in other species, including rats, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, and yeast, and the use of MPPs in model organism research has accelerated significantly in recent years ([21] and refs therein).",

A genome-wide mediation approach in 192 DO mice was used to link transcriptional and post-translational regulation of protein levels [22]. CC mice were then used to confirm results by showing correspondence with estimates of founder haplotype effects from each of the related populations. More recently, mediation analysis was used to connect chromatin accessibility with gene expression in embryonic stem cells derived from DO mice [23]. The CC and DO, and MPPs more broadly, have well-characterized haplotype structures that provide a unique opportunity for studying mediation at the haplotype level. This is potentially advantageous because haplotypes can capture genetic variation and its effects more comprehensively than can individual SNPs [24], the latter being the predominant basis for comparable mediation analyses in humans.",

Energy metabolism pathways were more active in liver and kidney and immune-related pathways were more pronounced in lung, as expected. We compared the concordance between DE genes and DARs genome-wide and observed that most DE gene promoters do not show significant differences in chromatin accessibility (S2 Fig). In cases with significant variability in accessibility at the promoter of a DE gene, though, the vast majority agree in direction (i.e., higher expression with greater accessibility).",

We found that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 2 gamma (Pik3c2g), a gene of interest for diabetes-related traits [32], had tissue-specific local-eQTL in all three tissues that closely matched the subspecies inheritance at their specific genomic coordinates.

In lung, the CAST haplotype (cast subspecies lineage) resulted in higher expression, consistent with a cast versus dom/mus allelic series. In kidney, the B6, 129, NZO, and WSB haplotypes (dom subspecies) resulted in higher expression, whereas AJ and NOD (mus), CAST (cast), and PWK (dom) haplotypes showed almost no expression, mostly consistent with a dom versus cast/mus allelic series. The PWK founder appears inconsistent, but we note that the QTL peak was in a small dom haplotype block interspersed within a broader mus region. The expression level in kidney of Pik3c2g in PWK was low, similar to AJ and NOD, suggesting that the causal variant may be located in the nearby region, where all three have mus inheritance and, notably, where the peak variant association occurred. In liver, the B6 haplotype resulted in lower expression compared with the other haplotypes. Interestingly, the liver eQTL was in a region that contained a recombination event between dom and mus, only present in B6, which may explain the unique expression pattern.",

Akr1e1 and Zfp985 expression were negatively correlated (r = \u22120.69), consistent with ZFP985 inhibiting Akr1e1 expression. This same distal-eQTL and mediator relationship for Akr1e1 was observed in kidney tissue from 193 DO mice (S17 Fig). It was previously postulated that Akr1e1 is distally regulated by the reduced expression 2 (Rex2) gene, also a ZFP that contains a KRAB domain and resides in the same region of chromosome 4 [37]. Our distal-eQTL overlap their Idd9.2 regulatory region, defined as spanning 145.5\u2014148.57Mb, mapped with NOD mice congenic with C57BL/10 (B10) [35]. The B10 haplotype was found to be protective against development of diabetes, characteristic of NOD mice. AKR1e1 is involved in glycogen metabolism and the Idd9 region harbors immune-related genes, suggesting genes regulated by elements in the Idd9 region may be diabetes-related. Consistent with these studies, CC strains with NOD inheritance at the distal-eQTL had low expression of Akr1e1, observed in all tissues. Genetic variation from B10 is not present in the CC, but the closely related B6 founder had high expression of Akr1e1 like B10. NZO, PWK, and WSB haplotypes resulted in low Akr1e1 expression, similar to NOD, while AJ, 129, and CAST haplotypes joined B6 as driving high expression (Fig 9).

The reduced number of cQTL compared with eQTL is likely due to both technical and biological reasons. Technically, the RNA-seq assay measures a distinct class of molecules (mRNAs) that can be accurately extracted from cells with the resulting sequence reads mapped to the transcriptome, which encompasses < 5% of the genome. In contrast, the transposon incorporation event central to ATAC-seq is enriched in, but not solely limited to, accessible chromatin. Unlike the transcriptome, accessible chromatin can occur anywhere in the genome and regions are defined empirically by the data. Thus, the signal from the assay is more variable and noisy across samples, which impedes our ability to detect cQTL. Biologically, if a variant affects the activity of a regulatory element that alters expression levels, it is expected that the mRNA levels in the sample will reflect this. By contrast, even if a variant affects chromatin accessibility, it may do so in a manner that is difficult to detect above the background noise of the assay. In recent studies of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the adult brain from the same individuals, 2,154,331 cis-eQTL were found for 467 individuals [38], whereas only 6,200 cQTL were detected, albeit for only 272 individuals [39]. While the reduced number of individuals undoubtedly contributed to this lower number of detected cQTL, it is likely that significantly fewer cQTL would be found in the same number of individuals.",

We believe our use of formal statistical tests of the correlation coefficient between the haplotype effects of overlapping QTL is novel in defining co-localizing QTL across tissues. This method allows us to identify loci likely representing tissue-specific QTL with unique haplotype effects patterns, as demonstrated for the gene Pik3c2g (Fig 4). This approach can also detect consistent haplotype effects, as with the gene Per2 (Fig 5B), which possessed only marginally significant distal-eQTL in the three tissues, suggesting jointly mapping QTL across all tissues increases power. Formal joint analysis approaches have been proposed, largely implemented for detecting SNP associations, including meta-analysis on summary statistics (e.g., [43, 44]) and fully joint analysis, including Bayesian hierarchical models [45] and mixed models [46]. Extending such methods to haplotype-based analysis in MPPs poses some challenges, including how to best generalize methods to more complex genetic models and for the CC with a limited number of unique genomes. Nonetheless, when multiple levels of molecular traits are measured, joint analyses could conceivably be incorporated into the mediation framework to improve detection power.",

It may be that these genes are primarily expressed in a common cell type whose proportion varies between the different tissue types, and that the observed differential expression reflects this compositional variation.

Our mediation analysis approach is adapted from previous studies in DO mice [22, 23, 33] but adds the use of QTL effect sizes to establish consistency with the directionality of the relationships and the formal calculation of an empirical mediation p-value through permutation. Related conditional regression approaches were used in the incipient pre-CC lines [47, 48]. Mediation results largely reflect the correlations between the variables after adjusting for additional sources of variation, such as covariates and batch effects. We further require the mediator QTL to have a larger effect size than the outcome QTL in order to identify trios that are consistent with the proposed causal models. It must be emphasized, however, that these steps are not equivalent to experimentally controlling the directionality of the relationship between a gene\u2019s expression level and a putative mediator, nor is such control feasible in a large-scale experiment. Variable measurement error on the mediator and gene could flip the perceived directionality of the relationship, resulting in both false positive and negative mediations. Alternatively, the relationships could be more complex than the simple models used here, e.g. feedback between the mediator and gene, which these procedures will not detect.

Additional evidence suggests this is done by ZFP985 contributing to reduced Akr1e1 promoter activity.

Based on a recent evaluation of QTL mapping power in the CC using simulation [26], this study had approximately 80% power to detect genome-wide QTL with a 55% effect size or greater. Effect size estimates for genome-wide QTL (green dots; S19 Fig) are consistent with this expectation, albeit potentially inflated due to the Beavis effect [49], and provide interpretable point summaries for haplotype-based QTL mapping, analogous to minor allele effect estimates in SNP-based studies. We calculated estimates of effect size in two ways, one based on a fixed effect fitting of the QTL term and the other as a random term [50]. Notably, a small number of the distal-eQTL had low random effect size estimates (S20 Fig) compared with their fixed effects-based estimates, likely the result of outliers with lowly-observed founder inheritance (e.g. rare allele) at the putative QTL. Alternatively, a residual variation estimate, i.e. RSS, could be calculated from the shrunken haplotype effects to identify likely false positives, but not be as aggressively reduced as the variance component-based estimates, representing a middle ground approach that was found to be effective [51].

The relatively limited number of CC strains (< 70 strains) constrains our ability to effectively map QTL for highly complex and polygenic traits. Nevertheless, this study supports the value of CC strains for mapping QTL for simpler traits, such as large effect molecular phenotypes, particularly when considering the further gains that use of replicate observations per strain would yield (not used here). Additionally, joint and/or comparative analyses with the DO and the founder strains can provide strong confirmation of subtle findings in the CC.",

Denote the expression level for j in individual i as yiGj and eQTL effect as eQTLiGj (these respectively correspond to Y and X in the mediation description above). Further, consider a proposed mediator k\u2208K, where K is the set of all eligible chromatin accessible sites or expressed genes, and let mik be the value of that mediator for individual i. The mediation scan for a given gene/eQTL pair j proceeds by performing, for each proposed mediator k\u2208K, a model comparison between the alternative model,\nyiGj=\u03bc+eQTLiGj+mik+batchb[i]+\u03b5i,(3)\nand the null model,\nyiGj=\u03bc+mik+batchb[i]+\u03b5i,\nwhere other terms are as described for Eq 2. (Not, shown are additional covariates, such as conditioned loci, which would be included in both the null and alternative models.) The above model comparison can be seen as re-evaluating the significance of a given eQTL association by conditioning on each proposed mediator in turn (i.e., testing X \u2192 Y|M for each M). The resulting mediation scan, in contrast to the earlier-described genome scans, thus fixes the QTL location while testing across the genome for candidate mediators.",

For mediators that possess some or all of the information present in the eQTL, however, the mediated logP will drop relative to the original logP, reflecting X \u2192 Y|M being less significant than X \u2192 Y. Empirical significance of genome-wide mediation has previously been determined by comparing the nominal mediator scores to the distribution of mediation scores genome-wide, the latter effectively acting as a null distribution [22, 23, 33]. We instead determine a null distribution explicitly by permutation, characterizing the distribution of the minimum logP (as opposed to maximum logP for QTL scans) to estimate significance and set false positive control (FWER). As with the QTL mapping procedures, we performed mediation scans on 1,000 permutations, permuting the mediators rather than the outcome, to characterize GEVs from the minimum logP, that is, permPm = FGEV(logP), at both chromosome- and genome-wide levels.",

            "text": "Detection of mediation is dependent on a number of assumptions about the underlying variables, their relationships, and those relationships\u2019 directionality [4]. Many of these cannot be controlled in a system as complex as chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in whole living organisms. Nevertheless, signals in the data that are consistent with the mediation model represent candidate causal factors that regulate gene expression. Though it is impossible to ensure that the direction of causation is indeed M \u2192 Y, as assumed by the mediation analysis, we require additional checks to formally declare mediation of an eQTL. The presence of the relationship X \u2192 Y is already established in that mediation scans are only performed for detected eQTL. In addition for any candidate mediator with a significant permPm, we require detection of a mediator QTL: X \u2192 M. These requirements, as mentioned earlier, are consistent with traditional mediation analysis. Finally, in an attempt to identify mediator-to-gene relationships consistent with the proposed models, we require that X \u2192 M is more significant than X \u2192 Y. Though this step cannot confirm the directionality of the relationship between M and Y, as variable noise level between M and Y could reduce the estimated effect size of their respective QTL, it will identify candidate mediators that are consistent with the proposed models. Further details on the mediation analysis are described in S3 Appendix, including the permutation approach and the formal criterion by which mediation is declared for both chromatin and gene mediators (Fig 6).",
