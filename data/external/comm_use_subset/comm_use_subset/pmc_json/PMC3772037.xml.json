As with other VHF, events that determine LF fatal outcome occur very early in the disease and depend on the host immune system [12], [13]. Macrophages (MP) and dendritic cells (DC) are the initial targets of infection, followed by viremic seeding of a wide variety of cells and organs. High viremia and elevated levels of AST in plasma are two major risk factors predicting fatal outcome [14]. Although the most consistent pathologic finding is hepatocellular necrosis, the extent of liver damage is usually insufficient to implicate hepatic failure as the cause of death [14], [2]. Functional damage of platelets and endothelial cells seems to play an important role [15], [16], [2]. However, contribution of pro- and anti-inflammatory stimuli to LF pathogenesis is not clearly understood.",

We used PBMC profiling previously to show that ML29 elicited less inflammatory gene expression than MOPV [29], recapitulating similar profiles of ML29 in na\u00efve primates [26], and in SIV-infected macaques [30]. Human PBMC exposed to virus is a model for the viremic stage of infection in vivo when much of the transcriptome response is due to non-infectious signal transduction by viral particles [31]\n[24]. PBMC were used here and in other studies [32]\n[33]\n[34] rather than cell lines [35]\n[36] to more closely simulate the situation in vivo in which circulating blood cells are exposed to virus-infected sites. Here we have shown that in vitro PBMC exposure to arenaviruses with different pathogenic potential, LASV and ML29, resulted in differential expression of ISG, apoptotic, NF-kB, and coagulation pathway genes.",

Finally the \u0394\u0394ct is calculated which involves subtracting the normalized average ct of LASV samples -normalized average ct of the Control Samples.

While the function of the IFI35 gene is not well-defined, the IFITM proteins have roles in immune cell signaling and adhesion, cancer, germ cell physiology, and bone mineralization. IFITMs are also viral restriction factors that block entry of Influenza, Ebola, Dengue and West Nile viruses but not arenavirus-envelope pseudotyped particles [47]\n[48]\n[49]. IRF-7 is over-expressed in LASV-exposed PBMC and others found that it could be up-regulated in 3-day LASV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages [50]. IRF-7 is also known to limit the burst size of LCMV in culture but is not ultimately essential for LCMV clearance in vivo\n[51]. IRF-7 and IRF-3 are transcription factors which together with NF-kB and ATF-2/cJUN induce production of IFN-I. IRF-3 is required for the activation of IFN-\u03b2, which in turn, primes the expression of most IFN-\u03b1 genes by IFN-induced IRF-7 through the STAT-1 pathway. Human SP110 plays an important role in resistance to intracellular pathogens such as human mycobacteria and intracellular cancers. Recently cellular proteins have been described that mediate the interaction of SP110 and viral proteins during viral infections [52].",

            "text": "The other coagulation-related genes could also contribute to LF disease: Plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) expression could be contributing to the anti-clotting effect mediated by LASV exposure. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like (HB-EGF) expression is involved in several blood vessel physiologies [58], in kidney pathology [59], [60], inhibition of NF-kappa B activation [61], in cardiac hypertrophy, and together with PD-ECGF promotes vascular maturation [62], [63]. The ITGB3 (CD61, platelet marker) was 12-fold up-regulated in cells exposed to LASV at 24 h. Integrins are integral cell-surface proteins composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. A given chain may combine with multiple partners resulting in different integrins. The ITGB3 is found along with the \u03b1IIb chain in platelets working as a receptor for fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, plasminogen, prothrombin, thrombospondin, fibronetin, osteospontin (SPP1), and vitronectin [64], [65], [66]. Integrins are known to participate in cell adhesion as well as cell-surface mediated signaling. High affinity LASV binding to cellular alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) receptor perturbs the signaling cross-talk between DG and \u03b16\u03b21 integrins, shifting the normal signaling equilibrium towards inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway [67]. The DG is a ubiquitous receptor for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which cooperates with \u03b21 integrins to control cell-matrix interactions.",

These genes were down-regulated at 4, 8 and, some, 24 hpe, suggesting a mechanism to avoid recognition by the innate immune system, and to interfere with essential signals in the pathway that leads to the development of type I immunity [73], [74], [75]. For example, interferon-alpha/beta inducible IFI44 is involved in the antiviral action of type I interferon [76], [77]. ML29 down-regulation of IFI44 probably allows the virus to replicate early during the infection so that a strong immune response can control viral replication and spreading. In support of this notion, other anti-viral genes such as RSAD2 (Viperin), and TRIM5 [78], [79], [80] were more expressed in LASV than in ML29-exposed PBMC.",

Nevertheless, virus-induced coagulation abnormalities and impaired vascular function is a hallmark of LF pathogenesis [3], [86]. Platelets remain either normal or moderately low, but with significantly reduced function. Plasma from LF patients has inhibitory activity on platelets from healthy individuals, suggesting the presence of soluble factors causing platelets malfunction [88]. Our previous work supports the notion that LASV can replicate vigorously in endothelial cells without cytopathic effects but with reduced cell function, such as reduced production of interleukin IL-8 [18].",

            "text": "Coagulation defects associated with LF disease could potentially be affected by LASV-upregulation of six coagulation-related genes, the most notable being thrombomodulin (THBD). THBD is predominantly synthesized by vascular endothelial cells as a 60 kDa type I trans-membrane protein that inhibits thrombotic, inflammatory and redox related responses [90]. THBD forms a 1\u22361 molar complex with thrombin and significantly enhances the rate of thrombin inactivation by ATIII while accelerating activation of protein C (aPC). We observed levels of secreted THBD in dendritic cell (DC) culture medium that correlated with our transcriptome data. DC exposure to LASV up-regulated secretion of THBD, whereas exposure to ML29 had the opposite effect. Notably, LPS treatment of LASV-exposed cells resulted in lowering THBD as well. In the presence of thrombin, THBD generates aPC, which inhibits pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory responses including: fibrinogen cleavage, factor V activation, platelet activation or local cytokine-induced chemotaxis for monocytes, neutrophils and up-regulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules [91], [92], [93]. It has been shown that THBD mRNA half-life is shortened by treatment of cells with IFN-\u03b3 [94]. This observation in addition to the LASV-increased THBD expression seen here, and the absence of IFN responses seen in vitro, are in agreement with LF findings where there is no clear inflammatory response and no cellular infiltrates, in conjunction with the high viral loads seen in the presence of hemorrhagic symptoms. The absence of THBD up-regulation in the LCMV-WE infected model for LF may be a key failing of the model (see details in Table S2).",

It is also possible that, during high states of viremia, LASV binds directly to platelets inhibiting their function. After an arterial injury, leukocytes are recruited to the site and there is an increase in ITGAM expression allowing adhesion of platelets and fibrinogen to the vessel walls [96]. We propose that LASV induction of ITGAM could increase platelet adhesion to tissues and this may explain the decreased number of circulating platelets during hemorrhagic episodes. Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) is involved in angiogenesis and wound repair [97], [98]. The differential expression of all those genes may be contributing to the non-pathogenic phenotype of ML29 and to the pathogenic phenotype of LASV.",

ISG and genes involved in apoptotic and NF-kB pathways were among the most LASV-affected genes at 24 h after exposure. LASV and not ML29 also affected genes involved in coagulation pathways, e.g. LASV strongly up-regulates THBD suggesting a connection to the vascular abnormalities in fatal cases of LF.
