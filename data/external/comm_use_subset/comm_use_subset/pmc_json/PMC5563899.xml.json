In our previous study, the Moran\u2019s I spatial autocorrelation analysis method was used to analyze the TB incidence data from 2009 to 2013 in Qinghai and found that the distribution of TB in this province was not random [7]. However the Global Moran\u2019s I spatial autocorrelation analysis only evaluates the distribution characteristics of the disease in several specific time points. Moreover, this method can not estimate the risk level of high-risk cluster areas [8\u201311]. It is a known fact that time is a critical confounder that might directly bias the determination of the high-risk regions of TB. The Kulldorff\u2019s space-time scan statistical method can detect the distribution characteristics in both the temporal and spatial axes, bringing them closer to real-world conditions [12\u201315]. Additionally, the relative risk of disease in a cluster area can be estimated by comparing it with the area outside the cluster area. This method has been used wildly in the epidemiology studies of infectious diseases [16\u201319].",

Since the population in several areas was very small, we used the radius of the population coverage instead of the geographical radius. The discrete Poisson probability model was used for scanning since the TB incidence was not very high [18]. The window with the maximum likelihood is defined as the most likely cluster area, and other clusters with statistically significant log-likelihood ratios (LLR) were defined as the secondary potential clusters. The P-values of LLR were estimated through 9999 Monte Carlo simulations [16, 18]. A P-value <0.05 indicates a significantly high risk inside of the scan window, which might be a potential cluster of a high risk of TB. The relative risk (RR) of TB in each cluster was calculated to evaluate the risk of TB in the cluster areas [12, 21, 22].",

In order to select optimal parameters, we analyzed the data of 2009 using the maximum spatial cluster sizes from 4% to 50% of total population at risk by increments of 1%. The radius was considered as an optimal radius for analysis if there were fewer overlaps between the areas defined by the radius, and the biggest area covered less than seven counties or 15% of all the counties [24, 25]. Similarly, we found an optimal temporal cluster size by testing the maximum temporal cluster sizes from 10% to 50% of the total study period by increments of 1% to analyze the data of the preceding 5 years (2009\u20132013). Based on the the optimal spatio-temporal parameters, retrospective space-time scanning analysis was applied to identify the geographic areas and time periods of potential clusters with significantly higher TB incidents than that of nearby areas.",

The high aggregated period for TB was observed in all districts from January 2015 to August 2016 (LLR = 353.28, P < 0.05). During this period, a total of 12,746 TB cases were reported, and the risk of TB related incidents was 32% (RR = 1.32) higher than that in other time periods (Table 1).\n\n",

            "text": "Kulldorff\u2019s retrospective scan statistics take multiple testing problems into account, which is known as the most powerful method for evaluating geographical and temporal distribution by using routinely collected data [18]. This method has been used worldwide to detect the clusters of diseases [2, 4, 5, 30, 31]. As is known, in the temporal and spatial model, selection of a suitable time window and spatial window was very important for model identification. Currently, there are two methods for selecting the size of spatial window: one is based on the geographical area, and the other method is based on the population size covered by the scanning area [16]. In this study, we used the radius of population coverage, because deviation of population in different counties was very large. Similarly, size of time scanning window is another important parameter for analysis. Generally, the window size of time was set as 50% of the entire time period of the study. However, there exists some evidence with regard to whether or not this window size is reasonable [32]. Yue Ma et al. conducted a simulation study to explore how to choose an appropriate scanning window. They found that the window might be too large to include the low-risk area if the window covered 50% of the population [23]. Therefore, this situation might lead to a high false positive rate. However, the window which covered a smaller population might be too small to detect the real high-risk area, and the high-risk area would be separated. Thus, the high false negative rate would be an issue. Tango and Takahashi suggested that when using the irregular scan statistic to detect the aggregated region, the coverage area of a single region should not be more than 15% of the whole study area [24, 25]. In addition, several studies also suggested choosing an appropriate window which could identify the cluster areas with less overlap [4]. Based on the Tango\u2019s criteria, we analyzed the data for many times by using one window value at a time. Finally, we selected the temporal window covering 30% of whole study period and the spatial window covering 7% of the population at risk. And the overlapping of the identified high-risk clusters was not observed.",

As is known, during winter, the reduction in exposure to ultraviolet rays from sunlight and the poor ventilation in indoor settings may increase the incidences of TB infections. Additionally, in the case of infectious diseases, time is needed for the symptoms to develop and patients may lack the knowledge on where to seek care for TB. All these factors may delay TB diagnosis and treatment [4]. Some studies reported that the average incubation period of TB infection ranges from 4 to 8 weeks, with a 2-month interval from the appearance of symptoms to medical diagnosis [33]. Therefore, the high-risk periods in spring and early summer complied with the disease characteristics. Such seasonal patterns were consistent with the previous studies done in Yunnan province, where is the registration peak of TB cases during spring [34].",

Compared with the median incidence rate of TB (69/100000) out of the cluster areas, TB incidence in our identified TB cluster was higher than 263/100000. This indirectly suggested a relatively high sensitivity of this scanning method. The spatio-temporal model used in this study simultaneously considered time and space distributions. Compared with the separated spatial scanning model and temporal scanning model, the time-space scanning makes a conclusion more closely to the real-world situation. Using this model to detect the spatio-temporal distribution of TB in Qinghai, from 2009 to 2016, we found that the high-risk counties were concentrated in the southwest Qinghai, from September 2014 to December 2016. During this period, the risk of TB infection in these areas was obviously higher than in other areas, especially in the Zhiduo County. In these areas, the inhabitants have very low income, as well as poorer living conditions and sanitation compared to the eastern region of Qinghai. Many studies have showed that poverty is one of the most important social factors responsible for the high prevalence of TB, and also the socio-economic status may contribute to the high risk of TB [4]. Our result indicated that further prevention and special TB control strategies should be considered in relation with the economical and sanitary level in the clustered areas.",
