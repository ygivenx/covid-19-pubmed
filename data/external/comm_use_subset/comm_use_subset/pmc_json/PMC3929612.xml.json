The totality of viruses present in faeces has also been frequently designated as the faecal virome [1], [2]. The functions of the faecal virome are supposed to be manifold, which include roles for the viruses as pathogens, regulators of bacterial growth, gene-transfer vehicles and modulators of the immune system [3]\u2013[6]. Early insights into the composition of the human faecal virome were provided by random cloning strategies [7], [8]. Later on, the availability of deep sequencing methods lead to more comprehensive analyses of faecal viromes [1], [9], including the development of process-controlled techniques enabling comparison of different analyses [10].",

Although samples derived from different continents had been analysed in these studies, the general composition was found to be similar. The majority of the detected virus sequences belonged to bacteriophages and pig viruses. Only a few sequences belonged to plant viruses as well as other viruses. Most of the bacteriophage sequences originated from viruses belonging to the families Siphoviridae, Microviridae and Myoviridae\n[10]. The most abundant porcine viruses were kobuvirus, rotavirus, pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus (PigSCV), astrovirus, sapovirus and enterovirus B. Most of them represent widely distributed enteric viruses of pigs [2], [10], [11]. Whereas rotaviruses are well-known pathogens of piglets, which may lead to diarrhoea [12], [13], [14], the clinical importance of the other viruses is a subject of controversy [10], [15]\u2013[22].",

[9] investigated the intra- and interpersonal variation by analysing faeces of monozygotic twins and their mothers at different time-points. By this, it was found that the viromes were unique to the individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Minot et al. [1] analysed the inter-individual variation of the human faecal virome and its dynamic response to diet. It was shown that the largest source of variance among the viromes was caused by interpersonal variations and not by the diet. A high interpersonal diversity of gut bacteriophages was also described in two humans which were monitored over a 2.5 year period [23]. In another study, a much lower diversity of the virus community was found in infants as compared to adults [24]. Although this study has been conducted by cloning followed by classical sequencing, mathematical modelling of the derived sequence data indicated that the virome of adults was composed of approximately 2000 genotypes as compared to only 8 genotypes in one week-old infants.",

This includes clinical studies showing beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria in children with rotavirus-caused diarrhoea [25]\u2013[27]. Feeding with probiotic microorganisms such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces boulardii or Bifidobacterium lactis resulted in milder clinical symptoms, reduced virus shedding and shortened the duration of diarrhoea in children [27]\u2013[29]. In pigs, Enterococcus (E.) faecium NCIMB 10415 is a commonly used probiotic bacterium [35], [37]. It has been shown recently, that feeding of pigs with this probiotic bacterium affected shedding of enteric viruses dependent on the virus species [30]. Especially, rotavirus was shed later and in lower amounts in the group of piglets that received E. faecium NCIMB 10415 as compared to the control group. The specific mechanisms responsible for this effect are not known so far. However, changes in the mucosal and systemic immunity due to feeding with E. faecium NCIMB 10415 have been described [31]\u2013[34]. In addition, direct interactions of this bacterium with enteric virus particles have been observed in in vitro studies [35]. However, it is not known so far, whether probiotic bacteria can also influence the general composition of the faecal virome, e.g. by changing the composition of the bacterial community, which represents the host population for bacteriophages, or by direct interactions with specific viruses.",

The sows received a commercial diet (UNA-HAKRA, Hamburg, Germany). Additional feeding of the piglets started at 12 days of age with a non-medicated non-commercial pre-starter diet [36]. After weaning at 28 days of age, they were fed with a non-commercial mash starter diet [37]. The homogenous distribution of the probiotic in feed has been previously demonstrated by a colony hybridization assay [37].",

Thereafter, numbers of mapped reads were corrected for multiple read assignments. The reads of the bacteriophages used as process control were subtracted from the number of the virus reads in subsequent analyses. Shannon index [46] was calculated to compare the diversity of the species identified by primary reads. The Shannon index is maximal for a sample with a balanced species distribution and it has a low value for a sample with an uneven species distribution; e.g. if some single species are a highly abundant. The maximal value depends on the number of species in a sample. Bray Curtis dissimilarity [47] was calculated for pairwise comparisons of samples and dendrograms were constructed by hierarchical clustering with the average linkage method. This analysis included counting of detected species and determination of their taxonomy, which was also used to determine the virus hosts (bacteria, vertebrates, plants etc.).",

A few studies investigated individual differences of faecal viromes and the influence of diet and age in humans [1], [9], [24], whereas similar studies on faecal viromes of pigs are almost missing. Technical problems with the use of deep sequencing methods for comparative virome analyses may represent one major problem in this context [10], [48]. Here, we tried to overcome some of these problems by using a process-controlled deep sequencing approach [10]. By this, the efficiency of the analysis can be estimated for each sample, thereby enabling identification of major differences due to different performances of the method. We could show here, that all types of the bacteriophages used as process control could be detected in the final data sets of all samples. This indicates that the method has a reproducible performance and the generated data can generally be used for comparative analyses. However, the detection rates of the process control bacteriophages varied between the samples from 0.9% to 3.4%. As the detection rate of the bacteriophages is \u2013 besides technical factors - also dependent on the amount of viruses initially present in the analyzed sample, improved deep sequencing methods enabling quantitative analyses should be developed in future for comparative virome investigations.",

However, large differences were detected in the ratio between bacteriophages and mammalian viruses in the distinct samples; in addition, the diversity of detected virus species varied between the analysed viromes. These data indicate that the faecal virome of pigs is not uniform and static, but shows a remarkable variability. For human faecal viromes, a high variability even between the analyzed individuals has been described [1], [9].

The percentage of porcine viruses, which comprised the most abundant group in the youngest piglet samples, decreased dramatically in the samples from the older pigs. In parallel, the percentage of bacteriophages as well as the diversity of detected virus species increased by age. Interestingly, porcine kobuvirus and pig SCV, which both had been discovered only recently [10], [49], were among the most frequently detected viruses in the faecal viromes of the youngest and oldest age groups, respectively. This underlines the importance of unfocused detection systems in order to get an undistorted picture of the abundance of viruses in a sample. As all samples analyzed here originated from an experimental feeding trial, the detected virus composition may vary in comparison to field-origin samples. However, the age-specific effect was strong and very similar in both analyzed groups, which were held completely separate during the whole period of the experiment. The differences may be explained by an age-related susceptibility to specific virus infections as well as by an increasing immunity to porcine viruses due to completed virus infections with higher age. In addition, the progressive diversification of the bacterial enteric flora, which serves as the host pool for bacteriophages, would also explain the increasing diversification of the virus flora by age. An increasing diversity of the virus species in faeces of humans has already been described [24].",

A relatively high percentage of Enterococcus phages in the sample derived from an E. faecium-feeded group may indicate multiplication of the phage due to the application of its host. This explanation may indicate that a larger amount of the probiotic bacteria may be lysed by the bacteriophages and are therefore not available for the probiotic therapy; however, this interpretation is questionable as the bacteriophages were only found in one of the samples. Also, a relative high proportion of astrovirus was found in one of the samples of the control group. Interestingly, real-time RT-PCR analyses of samples derived from the same feeding trial confirmed the presence of astrovirus exclusively in the control group [30]. However, the same study indicated later shedding of rotaviruses with lower amounts in the probiotic group as compared to the control group, which was not detected by our virome analysis. A closer inspection of the data shows that up to 107 astroviruses per gram faeces were present in the samples, whereas only up to 105 rotaviruses per gram were detected [30]. Therefore, a lower sensitivity of the virome analysis method may explain the discrepancies and still deeper sequencings may be necessary in future to detect more subtle changes in the faecal virome composition due to probiotic feeding.",

However, most of the detected sequence reads showed only moderate identities to the known bacteriophage sequences present in the database. Therefore, it has to be considered that the majority of the detected sequences belong to so far unknown bacteriophages and that the identified bacteriophage species represent only their next relatives. A definitive assignment of a host to these sequences is therefore currently not possible. The quality of the database with regard to genomic sequences of bacteriophages is crucial for virome analyses. For example, the high proportion of the detected Lactococcus phage 1706 may reflect the disproportionately high abundance of those phage sequences in the database as a consequence of intensive research on these bacteriophages, which are problematic agents for the diary cheese product industry [50]. In contrast, for another highly abundant bacteriophage, the dragonfly-associated microphage, the specific bacterial host is still unknown [51]. An increase of annotated bacteriophage sequences in the databases is therefore a prerequisite for studies on the interactions between bacteriophages and their host bacteria in the gut in future. Alternatively, a deeper sequencing may enable the assembly of complete bacteriophage genome sequences from the metagenomic data set. By this, an assignment to their hosts was possible by identification of inserted host-related sequences as recently described [3].",

Most obvious are age-related differences in the proportion between pig viruses and bacteriophages as well as an increasing diversification of virus species by age. Consistent differences due to probiotic feeding could not be identified by our metagenomic analysis. The results of comparative pig virome analyses may help to understand the complex interactions between viruses, bacteria and the pig within the intestinal tract. Future research should focus on the optimization of the method in order to increase its sensitivity and on the improvement of the sequence databases, especially regarding annotated bacteriophage sequences. It will be interesting to apply the optimized techniques to analyse the diversity of faecal viromes in individuals and to identify further factors like geographical origin or disease-related changes influencing its composition.",
