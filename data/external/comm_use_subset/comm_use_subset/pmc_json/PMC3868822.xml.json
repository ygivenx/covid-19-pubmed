In her book \u201cDead Aid\u201d, Ms Moyo argues that aid has actually increased poverty, corruption and dependency in Africa, while Mr Gates has commented that books like hers are \u201cpromoting evil\u201d. The clash has been prominent over Twitter, mostly light\u2013heartedly. The complex aid debate continues on and is becoming increasingly polarised, highlighting an apparent difficulty in quantifying impact of aid provisions. (The Guardian, 31 May 2013)",

The idea is simple: instead of spending cash on schools and infrastructure, individuals or businesses directly receive a fixed cash amount. There are two types of transfer: conditional (CCT) and unconditional (UCT). UCT recipients chose how to use the money, and CCT recipients have conditions attached, eg, school attendance, vaccinations or business planning.

They are invaluable when the main cause of poverty is shortage of capital and are very cost\u2013effective.

The report criticises the Millennium Development Goals for insufficiently focusing on the most excluded people, particularly those living with disabilities, or outside traditional household units. Despite the emergence of new technology for data collection, the household survey is recommended as an efficient, cheap and comprehensive method for broadening coverage and collecting better information about groups particularly affected by social inequality. Household surveys ensure that measurements and monitoring of groups previously sidelined in data collection are integrated into well\u2013established survey systems. (The Guardian, 10 Jun 2013)",
