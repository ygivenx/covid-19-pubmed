Population-level antibody immunity to these seasonal viruses builds up over time, so in any given season only a proportion of the population is susceptible to the circulating strains. Occasionally, influenza A viruses evolve rapidly through antigenic shift by swapping genes with influenza viruses usually circulating in animals. This process creates an immunologically distinct virus to which the population may have little to no antibody immunity. The virus can result in a pandemic if a large portion of the population is susceptible and the virus is easily spread.1",

Existing parameters for mathematical models of influenza interventions are largely derived from household cohort studies conducted in the USA between 1948 and 1981.8\u201310 Since then there have been profound social changes affecting population contact and mixing patterns that are likely to impact on influenza transmission. These changes include more women working, more children attending day care, more commuting and international travel and increased vaccine coverage. Evolutionary changes to circulating viruses may affect transmission dynamics, patterns of clinical illness and the adaptive immune responses elicited.1,11 Rapid advances in laboratory methods have also occurred, providing unique opportunities to investigate immune correlates, both humoral and T cell based, with influenza infection rates and disease severity.11,12",

It aimed to estimate community burden of influenza and influenza-like illness, generate up-to-date knowledge of demographic, social and behavioural factors affecting influenza transmission, measure antibody and T cell immune responses to influenza and to use knowledge generated to inform modelling parameters. In addition, a pandemic preparedness cohort was envisioned, in which participants already familiar with the study consented to be re-contacted in the event of a pandemic, to allow rapid redeployment of the study.",

Additional study aims were to inform the national and international response to the current and future pandemics. Specific objectives were to examine clinical profiles of illness, estimate population infection denominators and case fatality risk, describe epidemiological characteristics of the infection in real-time, monitor changes in population behaviour, and investigate access to services, attitudes to and uptake of antivirals and vaccine, and immunity to infection in order to inform vaccination policy and development.

During the first season, swabbing was limited to periods of influenza circulation.

For the T cell cohort, continuing participants used the spring blood sample from season 3 as a baseline sample. They also gave a pre-vaccination blood sample to allow distinction of antibody rises caused by infection rather than vaccination. This was particularly important for the winter wave of the pandemic, as we anticipated widespread vaccination. The Serology cohort was identical but lacked T cell samples. For the Virology cohort, no blood samples were taken. This allowed for rapid recruitment of a large number of participants (n = 1778) to increase the accuracy of weekly estimates of illness rates during the pandemic, with minimal nurse time required.

It is the first modern-day household study of influenza transmission in a temperate climate, comparable to the landmark Tecumseh studies of the 1960s and 70s.22 A major strength is the inclusion of different household types (rather than just households with children, as in earlier studies) which allows influenza infections to be explored across the whole of society. We used highly active methods of surveillance for influenza and other respiratory viruses, exploiting a range of IT-based technologies including automated telephone surveys, e-mail, internet and text messages. Broadly similar methods of follow-up were used across six influenza seasons, allowing accurate comparisons of disease burden estimates between seasonal and pandemic influenza despite external factors (such as media reporting during the pandemic) that may have affected consultation behaviour. Robust definitions of influenza were based on a range of diagnostic methods including real-time symptom reporting, PCR and serology, allowing the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain to be tracked. Serological and virological data from previous pandemics are either unavailable (1918 H1N1 pandemic), from small samples sizes (1957 H2N2 pandemic)23 or from populations with high vaccination rates which greatly limits interpretation (1968 H3N2 pandemic).22 Historical data on laboratory-confirmed rates of seasonal influenza mainly come from historical community studies of families in the USA between 1948 and 1981.10,22,24,25 Flu Watch is a good example of collaboration between disciplines (epidemiology, immunology, virology and primary care) and partners. The study provides a rich source of data on social, behavioural and biological factors affecting influenza transmission, enabling exploration of many research questions.",
