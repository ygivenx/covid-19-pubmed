During the past decade, the emergence of new diseases1 and the increasing threat of bio-terrorism have motivated the development of syndromic surveillance systems in public health focused on the early detection of health threats that require effective public health action2,3. Syndromic surveillance uses health-related data that precedes diagnosis. Although data of this kind are less specific than data from confirmed diagnoses they are typically more timely, which is an important consideration for real-time or near-real-time analysis and interpretation4. In veterinary medicine the development of systems for early health-event detection has followed a similar path to that previously taken in public health5. A recent inventory of current and planned European veterinary syndromic surveillance systems showed wide interest in European countries for syndromic surveillance, but also highlighted the novelty of this field6.",

            "text": "Small companion animal populations largely lack co-ordinated national and international disease surveillance. This has produced a deficit in our understanding of the dynamics and burden of the full range of endemic/emerging diseases in companion animals and leaves these populations susceptible to the emergence of health threats. Lack of disease surveillance also has implications for human health, as approximately 75 percent of new and emerging diseases are zoonotic7. However, as health records become digitised in veterinary practices they become more available for research8, providing an opportunity to improve companion animal syndromic surveillance in clinical settings and the possibility of linking this with human syndromic surveillance. Recently, electronic syndromic surveillance data on companion animals has become available in real-time on a national scale in the UK through surveillance schemes such as the Small Animal Veterinary Surveillance Network (SAVSNET)9. SAVSNET harnesses the growing volume of patient electronic health records (EHRs) available from small animal practices and complementary data from diagnostic laboratories to improve animal and human health through rapid and actionable research and surveillance.",

Specifically, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to generate samples from the Bayesian predictive distribution of the underlying spatio-temporal surface. These samples are then used to compute predictive probabilities at given thresholds; a high predictive probability at a particular location and time gives an early warning of a possible disease outbreak. The system provides end-users (i.e. practising veterinary surgeons) decision-support tools for immediate analysis and easy interpretation of their data. As an example, we apply our model to small companion animal EHRs collected over two years by SAVSNET from a large network of UK veterinary premises. We illustrate the feasibility of our proposed surveillance system using gastrointestinal (GI) disease in dogs and cats as an example.",

GI disease affects animal welfare, can be expensive to manage and may be transmissible to other pets10 or, more rarely, to people11. Current approaches to preventing and controlling GI disease in companion animals have focussed on individuals or small groups of animals. This seems to have had little impact on GI disease, which remains one of the commonest reasons for presenting for veterinary care in the UK9,10,12\u201315, although precise data to confirm this has been lacking. A more coordinated population-scale approach to GI disease surveillance in companion animals is needed.",

We then simulate spatio-temporal GI outbreaks by perturbing the actual SAVSNET data in various ways to demonstrate the ability of the surveillance system to achieve timely outbreak-detection.

This study used data for dogs and cats collected over the period between 1st March 2014 and 29th February 2016. In our analysis we included data from an increasing number of premises as they enrolled in the RoboVet and Teleos systems. By 29th February 2016 we had data from 216 practices (amounting to a total of 458 distinct premises) located in England, Wales and Scotland. The data were extracted from consultations where a booked appointment was made to see a veterinary surgeon or nurse, including out-of-hours consultations. Through the SAVSNET system a compulsory, single-question questionnaire is appended at the end of each consultation allowing the attending veterinary surgeon or nurse to categorise the main reason for the animal\u2019s presentation into syndromes (currently GI disease, respiratory disease, pruritus and renal disease) or other routine veterinary interventions (i.e., trauma, neoplasia, \u2018other sick\u2019, vaccination, \u2018other healthy\u2019 or post-operative check-up). Specifically, the definition provided to participating veterinary surgeons to categorise the animal presentation as GI disease is that the main reason for the animal\u2019s presentation are signs including but not limited to diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and poor appetite. A full description of the SAVSNET data collection protocol has been described by S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al.9. The data for this study were gathered on a consultation-by-consultation basis, and include the date the animal was seen, unique identifiers for practice, premise and animal, the animal description (including species, breed, sex and date of birth), the syndromic level classification and the full postcode of each veterinary premise and pet owner.",

The term \u201cunexplained\u201d refers to the fact that, for reasons that are well understood, some areas or times of year will experience higher fractions of GI consultations than others because of spatial variation in the local population susceptibility or temporal variation in the region-wide susceptibility to GI. We adjust for these known effects using measured explanatory variables, as described below in the section on explanatory variable selection. We then equate \u201cunexplained\u201d to \u201cstochastic\u201d and include this in our model as a latent, spatially and temporally correlated process Si,t, where i denotes premise and t denotes time, in days. By definition, the expected value of each Si,t is zero, and our goal is to determine where and when its actual value is materially greater than zero. Note that the natural pattern of GI consultations will always be subject to fluctuations in time and space that cannot be explained fully by measured variables. It follows that outbreak detection is not a statistical hypothesis-testing problem. Our approach acknowledges this by the fact that the actual value of Si,t will never be exactly zero. Our formal solution is therefore to calculate, for each premise i and day t, the predictive probability q (i.e. the probability conditional on all available data up to and including day t) that Si,t > l, where l is a user-specified threshold representing an effect large enough to be of practical concern. We then declare an outbreak affecting premise i if this probability exceeds q0, the required positive predictive value per premise, say q0 = 0.95 or 0.99. As with any prediction problem using observational data, it is not possible simultaneously to control both the positive and negative predictive probabilities.",

Recall that under Scheme 1 the outbreak affects only the central premise of each set. Also, the prediction algorithm exploits the estimated spatial correlation amongst the fractions of GI cases at different premises. As a consequence, the system is better able to detect an outbreak at a single premise when this premise does not have close \u2018outbreak-free\u2019 neighbours whose fractions of GI cases are as expected. In effect, the model smooths its predictions over a range corresponding to its estimated correlation range; Fig. 3 shows an example of this phenomenon. This explains why, under Scheme 1 (Fig. 1), the system delivers a stronger detection signal for the sparse than for the dense set. Under Scheme 2 (Fig. 2), the results for the sparse and dense sets are more similar. Also, because the outbreak affects more premises in the medium, and dense sets, their results show generally stronger detection signals than in Scheme 1, as indicated by the increased number of traffic-lights tending towards red in Fig. 2 compared with Fig. 1.",

We applied our system to 15 simulated GI disease outbreaks of varying spatial extent and severity, amongst which the system was able to detect 14 of the 15. Had these been real outbreaks, the proposed surveillance system would have triggered timely investigations, which ultimately would have aided control strategies. The system requires the user to specify a reporting threshold corresponding to an increase in case incidence (reporting rate) that would be considered large enough to be of practical importance. Given this reporting threshold, the system delivers the predictive probability, q, at each location (here, veterinary premise), that the threshold is currently exceeded. Declaring an outbreak when this probability is greater than a specified value q0 is equivalent to fixing the positive predictive value of the system (per location, per day) at q0. Alternatively, reporting the actual value of q gives an indication of the strength of evidence for an outbreak. Increasing the value of the reporting threshold, l, necessarily reduces the value of q and consequently increases the average time to detection of an outbreak at a fixed value of q0.",

Most of the methods used in veterinary and public health surveillance systems are concerned with detecting disease-outbreaks and health-related threats in time rather than in space30\u201338. However, disease incidences vary naturally in both space and time. Thus, for example, these techniques may be late at detecting outbreaks that start locally when the surveillance region is large39. In contrast, our proposed method has the advantage of being able to directly incorporate data for each individual animal\u2019s consultation, including the date of the visit and the location of the pet\u2019s owner. In temporal aberration detection algorithms, explanatory variables such as seasonality and day-of-the-week effects would generally be incorporated, but most of these methods cannot easily include individual-level explanatory variables.",

Also, they are based on an assessment of global pattern change throughout the geographical area under study, as opposed to our method, which is used to detect the specific geographical location of an outbreak. Prospective space-time scan statistics have also been used in syndromic surveillance systems for the early detection of disease outbreaks39,42. The space-time permutation scan statistic uses only case numbers, with no need for population-at-risk data39 and, in contrast to Rogerson\u2019s methods, does operate locally in both space and time. This method may therefore be suitable for setting up surveillance systems in the small animal sector where only case numbers are available. However, it does not acknowledge the uncertainty associated with any identified clusters, cannot easily incorporate continuous covariates, and can only detect outbreaks characterised by excess cases within a specified, regular shaped affected area, for example a circle or ellipse. Also, in our context the number of veterinary premises participating in SAVSNET can change over time due to the ongoing process of recruiting new premises and/or as a result of premises that could potentially stop being part of the project. This can lead to biased results if a space-time permutation model is used, as the method cannot distinguish an increase in cases due to a local population increase versus an increase in disease risk.",

Our surveillance system builds upon a similar epidemiological metric by modelling the spatio-temporal reporting rate of GI disease in dogs and cats as a proportion of all presentations. The two approaches use different inferential methods: the US study uses confidence intervals for recognising aberrant health events, whilst our approach uses predictive probabilities of exceeding policy-relevant thresholds. A more important difference is that we use a bespoke model that incorporates spatio-temporal covariance structure, with the aim of detecting outbreaks that are spatially and temporally localised without imposing any artificial assumptions on the geometrical shape of an outbreak or the extent of spatial correlation in disease incidence.",

Nevertheless, the practices included in the current study were widely distributed around the UK and represented 8.5% of those practices that constituted the source population in 200951. Thus, the number and geographical extent of SAVSNET-participating practices is such that changes in the relative risk of GI disease in this large network of premises can act as a proxy for changes in the level of GI disease in the wider source population.",

Conversely, a localised increase in the incidence of diagnosing other syndromes could conceal a genuine GI disease outbreak. If the goal is to detect anomalous patterns of absolute incidence rather than relative risk, then provided that data are available to calculate any changes in the population base of each premise our approach can be modified accordingly, for example by using a Poisson log-linear version of our spatio-temporal mixed model rather than the current binomial probit-linear version.",

Our detection algorithm uses Bayesian predictive inference within a spatio-temporal model. The method demonstrated promising performance in detecting simulated outbreaks signals of varying spatial extent and severity at different reporting thresholds. The system is flexible: the reporting threshold of elevated risk and the positive predictive probability per premise and day may be set to whatever levels best meet the needs of a particular application; the system estimates the parameters of the model from historical data rather than imposing specific values for these, and can therefore be re-calibrated to detect outbreaks of any syndrome of interest. A traffic-light system based on exceedence probabilities offers a visual aid to rapid identification of potential outbreaks on a given day at each premise. We intend to implement the system on SAVSNET servers for the early detection of outbreaks in GI and in other syndromes that have outbreak potential and are routinely recorded in SAVSNET.",
