Arrows\nindicate a precise statement (median or mean) of the incubation period while shaded\nblue areas indicate given ranges or confidence intervals. The top line of text\nsuccinctly summarizes the stated estimate from that source, using \u201ch\u201d\nand \u201cd\u201d as abbreviations for \u201chours\u201d and \u201cdays\u201d,\nrespectively. An asterisk indicates that the source did not provide a stated\nincubation period, but was included because it did provide original data that could\nbe used to estimate the incubation period. Citations shown in red or orange text are\nthose with original data and those in black are sources that do not contain original\ndata. Also on the first line, the abbreviation \u201cObs\u201d or\n\u201cExp\u201d appears, indicating whether the study was observational (in orange\ntext) or experimental (in red). The second line of text gives the last name of the\nfirst author and the year in which the source was first published. The weight or\nstroke of the arrow lines pointing to a given source corresponds to the cumulative\nnumber of citations that rely on that source for information. We used lightly shaded\ngray boxes to group multiple editions of the same source and multiple publications\nfrom the same study (for example, yearly CDC influenza reports). In the case of\ninfluenza the time scale is log transformed (with 1890 as year 1) to accommodate the\ngreater frequency of citations in later years. In all other cases the time axis\nfollows a linear scale.",
