These symptoms also occur with common non-zoonotic diseases, such as malaria and typhoid fever, which are likely to be considered more readily by clinicians (Crump 2012, 2014). Considerable social influences, such as training context, the influence of peers, and pressure to meet patient expectations, can also contribute to the overdiagnosis of diseases such as malaria, and thus to the relative underdiagnosis of other diseases including many zoonoses (Chandler and others 2008). Even well-recognised zoonotic diseases with distinctive clinical signs may be misdiagnosed as malaria. For example, in a study of childhood encephalitis in a malaria-endemic region of Malawi, rabies was confirmed as the cause of 10.5 per cent of fatal cases of encephalitis. Several of these cases were originally attributed to cerebral malaria, with clinical manifestations indistinguishable from those of cerebral malaria, but with subsequent histological examination showing no evidence of sequestration of parasitised erythrocytes in cerebral tissues (a hallmark of cerebral malaria) (Mallewa and others 2007).",

Other endemic parasitic zoonoses that contribute to neurological syndromes in the tropics include Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the zoonotic cause of human African sleeping sickness; and toxoplasmosis, which is the leading cause of central nervous system (CNS) disease in HIV-infected patients. A wide range of zoonotic parasitic diseases, including echinococcosis and trichinosis, as well as non-parasitic zoonoses, such as leptospirosis and borreliosis, also have the potential to cause a range of CNS signs, and may contribute to the burden of neurological disease in endemic areas.",

Even where clinical signs of disease are seen (for example, with Q fever, brucellosis and leptospirosis), the level of disease recognition and reporting is likely to be several fold lower in livestock than in humans, ensuring that animal healthcare providers often have even less observational data to inform diagnoses than their medical colleagues.",

However, a study in northern Tanzania reported abortion events in 19 per cent of cattle herds, and 33 per cent of sheep/goat flocks, with 12.9 per cent of female domestic ruminants having a history of at least one abortion (Shirima 2005). Infection with several of the priority zoonoses of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), including Brucella, Leptospira and Streptococcus species, Campylobacter, Chlamydia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Borrelia burgdorferi and C burnetii can cause abortion in livestock species and other animals. The fact that so many zoonoses affecting people in the tropics also cause abortion in livestock suggests that there is likely to be great value in One Health approaches that link aetiological and epidemiological studies of livestock abortion with research on common human health syndromes.",

Historically, epidemiological studies have relied mainly on serological surveys that demonstrate the extent of exposure in different animal populations. However, data gathered through serosurveys cannot inform understanding of pathogen shedding dynamics, which is critical for understanding zoonotic transmission risks. In many cases, serological assays also lack the specificity to differentiate between pathogen species or strain types. Serological tests cannot distinguish between infections with Brucella abortus or Brucella melitensis, for example, and there is considerable cross-reactivity between different Leptospira serovars. This lack of specificity has important implications for the identification of sources of infection and for the development of vaccination strategies. The use of culture and molecular methods for pathogen detection in animals has also been limited by many of the infrastructure and logistical restrictions that affect human disease diagnostics. In combination with a lack of research prioritisation, these factors play an important role in perpetuating low levels of knowledge and awareness of zoonotic pathogens circulating in livestock, domestic animals and wildlife populations.",

A study of healthcare-seeking behaviour among patients diagnosed with brucellosis in northern Tanzania revealed that just 22 per cent of cases sought care at a hospital within the first month after the onset of their symptoms (Kunda and others 2007). The sensitivity of blood culture for diagnosis of brucellosis is low even in the acute phase of disease and falls even further in the diagnosis of longstanding disease (WHO and others 2006). Similarly, in patients with leptospirosis, leptospires can only be detected in the blood of an infected person within the first week of clinical illness. Selection of appropriate diagnostic specimens is dependent on timing and requires careful history taking with regards to the timing of onset of clinical symptoms (Haake and Levett 2015). Isolation rates from blood culture can be very low even if patients are sampled during the acute febrile stages of illness (Levett 2001).

DALYs combine years of life lost to premature mortality and years of life lost due to time lived in states of less than full health to measure the impact of illness on an individual (WHO 2015). However, DALYs do not incorporate any measure of other kinds of disease impact, such as the economic costs of illness for the individual or society (Grace and others 2012). Crucially for the evaluation of the impact of zoonoses, DALYs do not include any measure of the impact of zoonoses upon animal health either directly or through the costs of lost animal productivity. These may include, for example, the impact of reduced milk production on child health and nutrition; the economic impacts of reduced reproductive success or abortion in commercially valuable livestock species, and the secondary consequences of the loss of draught power for subsistence farmers.",

This understanding will be important for establishing evidence-based public health policy and in developing clinical algorithms for disease risk to guide clinicians in diagnostic test selection and patient management. For example, in East Africa the prevalence of brucellosis appears to be substantially higher in both human and animal populations living in pastoral communities than in smallholder farming areas (McDermott and Arimi 2002). Brucellosis should therefore be considered a more likely cause of febrile illness in patients living in high-risk communities. Exposure to T solium infection is associated with community-level pig ownership and lower levels of sanitation. Thus, neurocysticercosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis of epilepsy where pig-keeping is practised in the patient's home community (Assana and others 2013).

However, the specific risk factors underlying these geographic trends remain unknown. Q fever is similarly pervasive, and although risk factors for animal and human infection have been identified in some settings (for example, associations with camels in Chad [Schelling and others 2003], and owner's ethnic group in Cameroon [Mazeri and others 2013]), much remains unknown about epidemiological risk factors in Africa.

However, marked variation in prevalence and strain type of infecting serovars exist and little is known about the factors that influence disease transmission in a wide range of agroecological settings.

Being able to distinguish the role and risk factors for B abortus and B melitensis in different host species is clearly a fundamental and urgent requirement before effective control measures including animal vaccination can begin.",

For example, effective livestock vaccines are available for the control of brucellosis, Q fever, leptospirosis, anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) and toxoplasmosis (T gondii). However, these have rarely been deployed in large-scale control programmes in low-resource settings, partly because the rationale for livestock vaccination tends to be argued only from the perspective of the livestock sector and in terms of private good to the livestock owner. Conversely, approaches to cost-effectiveness analysis of health interventions typically consider only the human health benefits, which represent only one component of societal benefits of zoonoses control. Incorporating public health benefits (for example, DALYs avoided), livestock production gains and livelihood benefits into these evaluations can substantially improve cost-effectiveness measures, and have provided a convincing rationale for advocating livestock vaccination against brucellosis in Mongolia (Roth and others 2003) and livestock interventions for control of trypanosomiasis (Shaw and others 2006).",
