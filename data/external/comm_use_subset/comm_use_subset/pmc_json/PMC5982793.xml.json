In 2012, the WHO declared ambitious targets to reduce the burden of these diseases by eliminating them as a public health problem by 2020 [1]. In support of these aspirations, a diverse consortium of donors, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and others made large commitments of funding, donated treatments, and other activities for 10 of these diseases in the London Declaration on NTDs [2]. Large morbidity gains have been made over recent years [3], and there are active discussions on how to exploit the likely synergies between the goals for NTDs and universal health coverage (UHC), a sustainable development goal (SDG; target 3.8) [4], in particular how to extend these gains to the hardest-to-reach or conflict-affected communities [5]. Of these 10 diseases, Guinea worm is targeted for eradication; the remaining 9 infections are targeted for elimination as a public health problem in some settings. The adjustment of strategies to achieve control of the 9 infections, informed by mathematical modeling, is the focus of this special issue.",

If the symptomatic phase is highly infectious and of sufficient duration (Figure 1, right-hand plot, green and red), interventions to identify cases early in the symptomatic period are likely to be highly effective. Although Chagas may not follow the increasing infectivity over time pattern but instead have rather high infectivity during early acute infection, diagnosis is so rare that postsymptomatic infections are often treated as asymptomatic infections, which may contribute substantially to transmission [28].",

It has a high case fatality rate and is targeted for elimination because it is thought to be an anthroponotic disease and current interventions have led to large drops in case numbers [33]. The main method of control is through screening of populations and treatment of infected individuals. A key question for sleeping sickness is the potential contribution of vector control as a complement to screening and treating. Modeling suggests that it could have a large impact, reducing transmission not only from cases but also from the uncertain quantity of asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, or even animal hosts [34]. The modelers also highlight the potential to increase the impact of screening, both passively, by increased access to diagnostics, and actively, by targeting high-risk groups (Table 1), to reduce the duration of infection and therefore transmission (the area under the curve in Figure 1) by all infected individuals.",

Cases are falling drastically, reducing the burden of disease, but there is debate around the drivers of this decline, the size and nature of any asymptomatic pool, and the risk of resurgence [35]. Modeling acts as a tool to investigate some of the possible scenarios and evaluate different policy interventions in response to them [22, 27]. In particular, the recent modeling of the different stages of the control effort suggests that there should be some accounting for underlying transmission rates when selecting interventions and that post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a late-stage potentially highly infectious state, could undermine control and should be studied more closely (Table 1).",

They are therefore only considered when diagnosis of infection is difficult (eg, stool-based microscopy, night-time blood samples and microscopy), there is little care-seeking by infected individuals, and there is a treatment with an excellent safety profile with a straightforward or single treatment schedule (Figure 2). Donation of the treatments for these 5 diseases by the pharmaceutical manufacturers has transformed the opportunities for reducing the burden of these diseases, but it has required additional investment to deliver the treatments, as well as data to determine when and where MDA should be delivered.",

One of the important issues in program design, and which can undermine a program\u2019s success, is which parts of the population should be treated (Figure 3). If the wrong group is treated, you may see reductions in burden in this group, but not in the population at large. This is discussed in 2 of the papers in this special issue. Soil-transmitted helminths are transmitted through helminth eggs in feces contaminating the environment [38], and schistosomiasis is caused by intestinal worms that are passed in feces or urine and contaminate the water. In the case of schistosomiasis, the eggs then go on to infect snails, the parasite is amplified and rereleased into the water, and humans are infected through contact with that water [39]. For both of these infections, current guidelines suggest that treatments should be targeted at children, with different frequencies according to prevalence. The modeling studies in this special issue suggest that the current guidelines might be altered slightly to optimize their impact, through either targeting adults or changing the thresholds for switching strategies [40, 41] (Table 2).",

The lymphatic filariasis campaign has been particularly successful, with billions of treatments given and recent scale-back of treatment in areas where the targets have been met. The policy discussion is around how best to accelerate achievement of the goals using alternative treatment strategies and, in particular, when and where these strategies might be most appropriate [43] and how they might be combined with vector control to slow down the epidemic growth rate between rounds of MDA [44]. If the bounce back rate is too fast, or the interval between treatments is too long, this can lead to all the gains from the previous round being lost (Figure 3). For onchocerciasis, the programs are at the point of adapting their strategies to reach beyond the large morbidity gains achieved so far.

This is because the MDA is a single dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and so the concerns about rapid emergence of resistance have been present since the beginning, but current evidence suggests that the selection pressure from this single dose may not be as high as feared. They also highlight the risk of resurgence due to importation of cases, which is a particular concern because of the rapid epidemic growth rate of trachoma [45]. Both of these issues are relevant for the other MDA campaigns (Figure 3), but the longer time between generations and hence the slower epidemic growth rates for the helminths mean that both resistance and re-emergence are likely to be slower than for trachoma. However, as these campaigns have been running for decades in some cases, it is important to consider.",

These definitions are part of a shifting landscape that is dependent on a changing epidemiology, demography, and on the availability of new tools. For example, with an appropriate treatment with a good safety profile in uninfected and nonsymptomatic persons, a disease could move from case detection to MDA or, when combined with the right diagnostic, to a screen and treat infection. Similarly, as prevalence falls for MDA diseases, if the right diagnostic becomes available, addressing these diseases could shift to a test-and-treat campaign or even case management. One of the roles of modeling is to evaluate the likely impact of new tools, treatments, and diagnostics; this is an active area of ongoing research that is not stressed in this issue.",

The area under this curve is proportional to the expected number of onward transmissions due to different stages of infection in a wholly susceptible population. If there are many nonsymptomatic people for each symptomatic individual, they may collectively contribute substantially to transmission even if their individual contribution is low (multiple yellow areas for single blue, green areas). For the symptomatic individuals, the relative infectiousness and duration of the symptomatic phase will determine the population-level impact of diagnosing and treating cases earlier (covering more of the green or even blue area).
