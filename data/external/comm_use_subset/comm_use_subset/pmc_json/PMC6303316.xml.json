Flaviviruses are transmitted among a wide variety of mammalian and avian hosts, with sylvatic cycles that perpetuate new outbreaks through spillover into humans and hinder disease prevention and control efforts. Migratory birds are hypothesized to have spread WNV in temperate areas of the Old and New World, and human WNV outbreaks in North America have been associated with corresponding WNV outbreaks in wild birds2,3. Flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) have well-recognized sylvatic cycles that maintain viral circulation in wild reservoirs between outbreaks in human populations4. Therefore, improved understanding of the potential wildlife host involvement in the transmission of emerging flaviviruses is essential. For instance, data about the transmission of ZIKV in South American wildlife are critical to inform on maintenance of the virus in the region, as sylvatic hosts can serve as a source of recurring epidemics and impede efforts for long-term disease prevention5.",

However, recognition of wildlife hosts for zoonotic pathogens is important for evaluating pathogen evolution within wildlife reservoir populations, advancing early detection of outbreaks through identification of sentinel species, mitigating risk at animal\u2013human interfaces, and monitoring threats that zoonotic pathogens might pose to wildlife6. When compared to viruses with a limited host range, zoonotic viruses with high host plasticity are more likely to spread after spillover by secondary human-to-human transmission and are known to have greater geographic spread7. While vector-borne viruses have greater host plasticity in general7, members of the flavivirus genus demonstrate a varying propensity towards host range; some infect species within a narrow range of taxonomic relatedness while others infect a wide range of vertebrate taxa4.",

Identifying macro-ecological patterns that facilitate viral persistence is crucial for understanding global variation in prevalence and propensity of flavivirus for epidemiologically important sylvatic cycles. Here, we collect data from published reports of non-human vertebrate hosts for thirty-five zoonotic flaviviruses (66% of the species within the genus Flavivirus10) known to cause human infection and associated with at least one non-human vertebrate host. We characterize the environmental and life history traits of known flavivirus hosts and identify new hosts whose trait profiles indicate a high probability for harboring flaviviruses. Our results identify regions with a high number of potential flavivirus hosts and vulnerability to sylvatic transmission.",

We detected 140 mammals (out of 5,536 mammal species11) and 277 avian species (out of 10,424 avian species12) as recognized hosts for flaviviruses. Flaviviruses were found to have an average of 18.9 hosts with a median of 4 hosts. Taken together, flaviviruses had a wide range of propensity for host plasticity based on diversity of species discovered to date, ranging from four flaviviruses (Bouboui virus, Cacipacore virus, Iguape virus, and Koutango virus) with only one host species, to WNV with a maximum of 194 host species recognized to date (Table 1, Supplementary Data file 1). Cluster analyses of zoonotic flaviviruses revealed multiple prominent clusters of viruses which share hosts from similar taxonomical orders. Group 1 viruses (ZIKV, YFV) were predominantly found in primate hosts. Group 2 viruses, which included WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), Usutu virus (USUV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), were found in a variety of birds and mammalian orders. Lastly, Group 3 viruses included Rio Bravo virus (RBV), Dakar bat virus (DBV), and Entebbe bat virus (ENTV) that were exclusive to bats. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV) did not cluster with any other flaviviruses (Fig. 1).",

Although TBEV shared hosts similar to WNV, SLEV, and USUV, it was modeled separately as it is transmitted by ticks while the other viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes. The optimal number of recursive trees where the holdout deviance was minimized in our models varied from 1,250 to 11,200 trees.

The variable describing the northernmost latitude of host species distribution (northernmost bound), showed the highest relative influence for this generic model followed by the geographical range of the species (log distribution area km2). The number of PubMed hits for species was used to control for sampling effort and reporting bias, was found to be the third most important variable. When the generic model was run both including and excluding number of PubMed hits, nine out of the top ten variables were retained as significant, indicating that although some species are well-studied, sampling effort did not substantially bias the overall results and interpretation for important macro-ecological traits of flavivirus hosts. With the exclusion of number of PubMed hits, westernmost bound of species distribution, metabolic rate, and body mass gained relative variable importance and rank, while the variables related to species population trend and latitude of species distribution centroid went down in the ranking. Southernmost bound was the new variable introduced into the top ten variables, which was otherwise ranked 12th for the generic model (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Data file 2). The trait profile of flavivirus-positive hosts indicated that hosts tend to have a wider geographic range, reside in more isothermal regions (between latitudes of 10\u00b0N\u201340\u00b0N) compared to non-host species, and have range distributions centered in subtropical regions, (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 3). In addition to northernmost latitude bound, southernmost and westernmost longitude bounds of host distribution were also found to be influential in multiple models. Host body mass (g) and metabolic rate for flavivirus host species showed a bimodal pattern, and species with scavenging habits showed a greater likelihood of hosting flaviviruses. The family Atelidae (New World monkeys, including howler, spider, woolly, and woolly spider monkeys) showed the highest relative influence for hosting flaviviruses compared to other families with respect to its influence on overall model predictions (Supplementary Data file 2). Additionally, an increase in the relative probability of a group of mosquitos and ticks within the host distribution range (12th and 14th influential variables respectively), was associated with higher probability of mammalian and bird species hosting flaviviruses (Supplementary Data file 2, Supplementary Figure 4). Results of the generic model were heavily influenced by a large number of avian hosts reported for WNV, SLEV, and USUV. Overall, the geographical range of the species, host body mass (g), and the number of PubMed hits for the hosts were among the top ten most influential variables in all independent and virus group models (Fig. 2).",

Among the nine predicted new hosts, only the Guinea baboon (Papio papio) has had YFV previously detected by serology (Supplementary Data file 3)13. Species from Rodentia (4% mean probability, SD = 6.3, n = 97) showed significantly lower probabilities for being YFV and ZIKV hosts compared to Primates (Mann\u2013Whitney\u2013Wilcoxon P < 0.005, Supplementary Figure 12). The geographical ranges of predicted host species for Group 1 viruses were more widely distributed than the geographical ranges of serologically-confirmed and antigenically-confirmed positive species and showed a higher host diversity in Africa, Asia, and South America (Fig. 3). Areas in North America and Europe indicate the distributions of predicted rodent species as hosts for YFV and ZIKV, but rodent species had very low probabilities, compared to primate species in other regions. When geographical distributions of species were weighted by model-predicted YFV and ZIKV host probability values, the probability map showed hotspots with high probabilities for YFV and ZIKV sylvatic hosts in South Asia and mid-eastern Africa (South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia), and a small hotspot in the eastern coast of South America (Fig. 4).",

We evaluate current knowledge of host species to enhance prediction of potential new sylvatic hosts of flaviviruses in order to address important gaps in current knowledge based solely on wildlife surveillance efforts. Models highlight important features of sylvatic hosts and the macro-ecological factors underlying variation in the propensity of flaviviruses to infect certain vertebrate species. Regions highlighted with a high number of predicted wildlife hosts have heightened risk of spillover of flaviviruses because we suspect there is a higher likelihood of suitable sylvatic hosts that could maintain the virus in nature. These maps can be used to guide surveillance efforts in the event of an outbreak to verify wild reservoir species and obtain needed data on epidemiological factors related to transmission of viruses within host species and animal\u2013human interfaces and/or vectors involved in transmission. Hierarchical clusters of flaviviruses based on similarity in host propensity resulted in groups which are part of the same flavivirus sero-complexes. For example, RBV and DBV are part of the Rio Bravo virus group, and WNV, USUV, and SLEV are part of the Japanese encephalitis virus group. Hence, while the clusters are comprised of viruses that are known to be phylogenetically similar, we demonstrate their ecological similarities as well. Whereas previous studies have used similar machine learning approaches to predict novel hosts for a single taxa group19,20, our modeling approach enabled evaluation of macro-ecological patterns shared by viruses from ecologically diverse viral genus across all mammal and bird species.",

Hosts with higher metabolic rates, especially bats and rodents that generally have a more fast-paced life history strategy, have been associated with a propensity to host a higher number of zoonotic agents including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa19,20. It has been hypothesized that the cost of a fast-paced life history reduces investments in the development of innate immunity, allowing species to host more pathogens21. Higher body temperature and metabolic rates of bats are also hypothesized to aid the ability of these species to host a wide range of pathogenic infections22. Our models indicate a similar trend among flaviviruses hosts, especially for YFV, ZIKV, and JEV. For all stratified models, flavivirus hosts had heavier weight than non-host vertebrate species. Even though taxonomical orders showed variation in the mean predicted probabilities, none of the taxonomical orders were found to have significantly higher probabilities for hosting flaviviruses in stratified models, except for primates which were found to have a significantly higher probability as YFV and ZIKV hosts. Life history traits and host ecology were more related to the susceptibility of species to flavivirus infection and could play an important role in the coevolution of hosts and flaviviruses.",

            "text": "Most flaviviruses are critically dependent on climatic conditions favoring recruitment and dispersal of their vectors and are likely to emerge or re-emerge in new areas due to projected climate change23,24. Travel of infected people and vectors has also enabled the emergence and re-emergence of flaviviruses in regions with suitable climate and vector distribution. The presence of a large number of susceptible hosts, as well as an increase in suitable environmental conditions related to climate change, could allow vectors to thrive and aid in establishing sylvatic cycles in newly predicted regions24. Our analyses indicate areas at increased risk of sustained sylvatic transmission with the ecological ingredients that could favor flavivirus transmission, even in previously na\u00efve regions. Results indicate a heightened risk of establishing sylvatic cycles of JEV in Europe and southern Australia, where host species with potential to maintain viral circulation exist. Similarly, predicted host species in Southeast Asia could facilitate establishment of sylvatic cycles of YFV and ZIKV. Therefore, these regions with high host diversity should inform on future flavivirus surveillance and outbreak preparedness. Historically, YFV successfully spilled back into sylvatic cycle in South America after its introduction in the 17th and 18th centuries25. On the other hand, established sylvatic cycles of DENV has not yet been detected despite the endemicity of this virus in South America. For emerging flaviviruses such as ZIKV, there is growing concern for the establishment of sylvatic cycles due to spillback transmission from humans to wildlife in geographical regions predicted with high ZIKV host diversity26. Maintenance of these viruses in non-vertebrate hosts pose a great hurdle for disease control efforts, where public health measures such as vaccines could control disease transmission in urban settings, but sylvatic cycles could continue to be a source of spillover to populations in rural areas26. Moreover, sylvatic circulation of flaviviruses could alter primate population dynamics and contribute to extinction risks in vulnerable primate populations as has been evident for YFV-related primate declines in South America with outbreaks that have decimated populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta spp.)27.",

These regions are biodiverse and coincide with high human density, recent urbanization, conversion of land for agriculture, and deforestation\u2014all of which can lead to increase in frequency of contact between humans and wildlife, thus increasing chances of viral spillover to humans28. Geographical features such as the distribution area of species have been previously found to be important in determining the likelihood of rodent and bat species carrying zoonotic agents19,20. Species with widespread distributions include commonly found peri-urban species, which have frequent interactions with humans that can lead to spillover at high-risk animal\u2013human transmission interfaces. The significance of wider geographical distribution area, human population and livestock density, and land use patterns may indicate a generalized host trait pattern towards synanthropic species.",

            "text": "Results presented here highlight significantly important species and regions of the world that should be prioritized for sylvatic surveillance of flaviviruses. Surveillance targets should be considered for their role as reservoir, amplifying, or dead-end hosts, as well as their ability to produce a level of viremia that is likely to propagate transmission. For example, WNV cases in humans are associated with the proliferation of virus in avian amplification hosts, but not with infected equines or humans because the latter two species produce little viremia47. Similarly, vectors and ecological conditions that are likely to facilitate transmission to humans will greatly impact the propensity of predicted species in hotspot regions to perpetuate sylvatic cycles. The host diversity hotspots shown here include both the wintering and breeding grounds of migratory birds, especially in case of WNV, SLEV, and USUV which inlcude temperate regions that are not likely to favor year round transmission because of reduced abundance of vectors and shorter summer seasons. Even with well-informed targets for surveillance, field-based detection of flaviviruses in wild animal hosts requires a large-scale effort with a low probability of detecting positives, especially given the very short duration of infection for most flaviviruses. Sero-surveys, which are becoming increasingly specific, have been used to detect positive animals during ongoing outbreaks (e.g., of 4\u20136% for WNV in wild birds47). Detection of YFV in animals is often triggered by mortality events in New World monkeys27,48. Aside from outbreak investigations, comprehensive longitudinal sampling efforts for sylvatic host detection has been uncommon due to logistical hurdles.",

Large-scale ecological and climate changes will lead to shifts in the distribution of both hosts and vectors, with direct implications for spillover risk of flaviviruses from host species. As global surveillance efforts continue to generate more data on the distribution of wildlife hosts and as new hosts are discovered, the modeling framework presented here can be used to anticipate regions with flavivirus emergence vulnerability and better inform on the impact of sylvatic transmission on global health.",

This approach also allowed us to account for geographical variation in the surveillance as species are geographically distributed. Supplementary Figure 14 shows the geographical variation in the PubMed hits used in the generic model to account for sampling biases. Many of the large-scale surveillance programs target probable species candidates, and hence sufficient sampling effort among animals that have tested negative for a virus was rare. While knowledge of true negative species would have facilitated model training, ascertainment of species status as non-hosts (i.e., unable to harbor flavivirus infection naturally) was not feasible. Thus, we choose a conservative approach of identifying species that share similar macro-ecological traits as known hosts. For modeling purposes, we generated a binary code for each mammal and bird species (1, if the species is currently known to host any flavivirus and 0, if not, Supplementary Data file 3), generating a baseline for prediction based on known species, which will be iteratively improved following the discovery of new flaviviruses hosts with appropriate field data.",

For this analysis, data were partitioned into training and holdout sets (80% of observations used for training, 20% used as holdout) and relative sizes of positive samples were kept similar in both the sets (Supplementary Table 1). For model building, we used a 10-fold cross-validation method to avoid overfitting for tuning model parameters. Using this method, training data were randomly partitioned into ten, equal-sized subsamples and each subsample was retained once as testing data, while the rest of the data was used to train the model. We used the gbm step function from R package gbm65, to assess the optimal number of boosting trees, as described in Elith et al.11 The BRT model generates additive models in a step-wise manner while optimizing the differentiable loss function. At each stage, a regression tree was fit on a Bernoulli loss function. The holdout dataset was then used for external validation of the model performance. Relative influence of host traits was estimated using the equation developed by Friedman for tree-based methods66 and is based on the number of times a variable is selected for splitting, weighted by the squared improvement to the model as a result of each split averaged over all trees11. For assessment of the robustness of the methodology with respect to reporting bias, we reran the generic model by excluding the host factor related to the number of primary publications in PubMed.",

The stratified models were developed to explore the virus-specific host patterns and to minimize biases related to variability in research effort among viruses. Bias towards the inclusion of more well-studied hosts is likely to influence results of the generic model. Binary responses for these models were based on whether a host species was known to carry any of the viruses within each virus group. Virus-specific models were restricted only to species from taxonomical orders with confirmed hosts for those viruses (Supplementary Table 4). To evaluate model robustness to species classifications, we developed a second model for group 2 viruses (WNV, SLEV, and USUV) with hosts reclassified as positive only if they had been detected positive by PCR or virus isolation (and not considering species found positive by PRNT).",

To represent model-predicted probabilities with species distributions, we assigned predicted probability values for each host species to the raster layer representing the geographical ranges of the hosts and summed the probabilities across all the raster layers to generate maps showing hotspots with high predicted host probability.",
