Influenza vaccination may have limited efficacy in this population, possibly due to age-associated declines in both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [1, 2]. Cases of influenza in influenza-vaccinated seniors represent vaccine failure, and a therapy that can enhance the anti-influenza response in influenza-vaccinated seniors would be of therapeutic benefit in this population.

Evidence from numerous in vitro and animal studies indicates that CVT-E002 acts through Toll-like receptors to stimulate both innate and acquired immunity and enhance immune responses to viral infections.For example, in a study of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured with live influenza virus, CVT-E002 was found to enhance the production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 [4]. In another study, CVT-E002 increased the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in natural killer (NK) cells cultured with influenza virus (Y. A. Jing, Internal report). Daily administration of CVT-E002 for 6 weeks to mice with viral-induced leukemia was found to increase the proportions of macrophage and NK cells in the bone marrow and spleen of treated animals [5]. Clinical efficacy of CVT-E002 has also been demonstrated for the prevention and treatment of viral upper respiratory infections (URIs), in particular, influenza, in healthy adults, and institutionalized and community-dwelling seniors [6\u20138].

It was also the only study to date to systematically assess a full panel of viral causes for respiratory infection in seniors taking CVT-E002 preventatively and the first study to look at the impact of CVT-E002 dose on efficacy. It was hypothesized that regular supplementation of CVT-E002 during influenza season would maintain immune stimulation and, therefore, would reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of viral URIs in otherwise healthy influenza-vaccinated seniors. It was also hypothesized a dose response would be observed resulting in improved efficacy of 800 mg/d of CVT-E002 over that observed with 400 mg/d. The specific objectives of the study were (1) to determine the dose-related prophylactic efficacy of CVT-E002 in community-dwelling influenza-vaccinated seniors on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed-clinical URIs, (2) to evaluate the effects of CVT-E002 on the incidence and frequency of all URIs meeting a Jackson-based criteria, (3) to determine the efficacy of CVT-E002 supplementation on the severity and duration of URIs, and (4) to assess the safety and tolerability of chronic administration of two dosages of CVT-E002 in older adults.",

AEs classified as infections included bladder infections, bone infections, skin infections, and lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. It should be noted that since pain and pulmonary AEs could refer to non-URI-related events (e.g., arthritis pain) and since the URI definition required multiple symptoms of a certain intensity and duration, there is not a direct correlation between AEs in these categories and the incidence of Jackson-confirmed URI. Subjects maintained the same dosing, even during an URI, and were told to try and avoid any additional medications for their URIs unless prescribed by their physician. Initially, a one-month supply of the medication was given to the subjects. Additional medications were distributed after 1 and 3 months participation. A final visit was scheduled at 6 months. During these scheduled visits, they returned their completed study logs and any leftover medication. In addition, blood pressure measurements were completed during these visits. ",

The present study was designed to evaluate possible dose-related effects of CVT-E002 when administered to influenza-vaccinated, otherwise healthy, community-dwelling seniors (\u226565 years). In particular, subjects with a seasonal immunization against influenza were recruited to determine if CVT-E002 supplementation would provide additional prophylaxis to that provided by the vaccine, which is not always protective in this population. The results indicate that regular supplementation of CVT-E002 during winter months was effective in reducing the number of Jackson-confirmed respiratory infections in healthy seniors. CVT-E002 treatment, however, was not found to have any significant effect on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed clinical URIs. These results are somewhat different from an earlier study in which regular dosing of CVT-E002 was found to be effective in reducing the incidence of acute respiratory illnesses due to influenza and RSV in influenza-vaccinated institutionalized seniors [8]. This discrepancy in the results could be explained, in part, by the lower than usual incidence rate of influenza reported at all 4 study sites during the present study. A report from Health Canada indicates that the overall percentage of influenza positive tests in the 2005-2006 season (8.5%) was lower than in the 2004-2005 and 2003-2004 seasons (12.7% and 12.3%, resp.) and a further lower incidence rate of 5.5% was observed in the present study (Table 2) [12, 13]. In addition, the age group accounting for the greatest proportion of cases during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 flu seasons was reported to be 0\u201314 age group (45%) as compared with the 2004-2005 season in which 46% of the cases were represented by the \u226565-year age group. In the present study, the milder nature of the influenza outbreaks and the lower rate of positivity for respiratory viral infections among participants (5.5%) may have resulted in an insufficient power to manifest treatment effects. Delays in collection and transportation of swab samples may also have contributed to the unexpectedly low rate of laboratory-confirmed infections and resulted in the lack of efficacy of CVT-E002 in meeting the primary end point.

The population of subjects completing the study was used in the analysis because of evidence from a previous trial that there is a threshold of time required for the treatment effect size to be measurable [6]. CVT-E002 was particularly effective in reducing the number of URIs meeting a Jackson-based criteria, a criteria based upon the subjects own perception of severity of the symptoms. Use of these clinical criteria of URI is valid and improvement in this measure is clinically relevant. CVT-E002 supplementation at 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day was found to reduce the relative risk of Jackson-confirmed URIs by 31% and 33%, respectively (Table 2). The number needed to treat with CVT-E002 doses of 400 mg/day and 800 mg/day was found to be 11.2 and 10.5, respectively. The TSS and duration of these URIs was also found to be reduced. The results are in agreement with an earlier study on healthy adults in which regular dosing of CVT-E002 during an influenza season was found to be effective in reducing the number, severity, and duration of Jackson-confirmed URIs [7]. Although the underlying mechanism(s) of these effects was not determined in the present study, evidence from earlier studies indicates that immune modulating properties of CVT-E002 may have been involved. CVT-E002 is known to act through Toll-like receptors to stimulate innate and Th1-type immune responses [3, 4, 14, 15]. It is, therefore, possible that by enhancing inflammatory responses of innate and T cells to the respiratory viruses, CVT-E002 may have reduced the viral load and hence prevented or shortened the duration of respiratory symptoms. The observed reduction in cardiovascular adverse events in participants taking CVT-E002 was unexpected and warrants further evaluation. ",
