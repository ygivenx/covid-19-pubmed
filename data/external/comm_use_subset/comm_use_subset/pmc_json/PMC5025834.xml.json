This recombinant virus, denoted as the 67 mutant virus, replicated at the same rate and to the same extent as wt virus during multiple cycle growth in human A549 cells (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the 67 mutant virus was inhibited to a greater extent than wt virus when A549 cells were pretreated with IFN-\u03b2. Whereas IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment of A549 cells reduced wt virus replication 20\u201330-fold, replication of the 67 mutant virus was reduced 200\u2013300-fold. This tenfold difference was eliminated by an ISG15-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA), but not the control siRNA (Fig. 1b). A different ISG15-specific siRNA had the same effect (Supplementary Fig.1a,b). These results establish that the primary defect of the 67 mutant virus is the inability to counteract the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2-induced ISG15.",

This duration and dosage of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment was sufficient to induce free ISG15 but no detectable ISGylation at the time of virus infection. Consequently, ISGylation occurs only during virus infection, enabling us to determine the effects of wt and 67 mutant virus on ongoing ISGylation. Infected cells were harvested at 12 and 24 h after infection, and the amount of ISG15 conjugates was measured using immunoblots. Based on the previously published co-transfection experiment23, it would be expected that wt virus, but not the 67 mutant virus, would inhibit ISGylation. Surprisingly, we observed the opposite phenotype: substantially more ISG15 conjugates were produced in wt virus-infected cells than in 67 mutant virus-infected cells (Fig. 1c). These results lead to the unexpected conclusion that the NS1B protein does not inhibit IFN-\u03b2-induced ISGylation in influenza B virus-infected cells.",

Wt virus infection in the absence of IFN-\u03b2 pretreatment induces ISG15, but not ISGylation (lane 8), which is more clearly shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a. ISGylation is not induced because virus infection alone does not induce the synthesis of UbcH8, the E2 enzyme for ISGylation, and probably the other ISG15 conjugation enzymes. When IFN-\u03b2 was added after infection, both the wt and 67 viruses inhibited the synthesis of UbcH8 and hence ISGylation (Supplementary Fig. 2b).",

To facilitate this analysis, we generated two A549 cell lines that express either wt ISG15 or an ISG15 mutant containing C-terminal Ala-Ala instead of the Gly-Gly required for ISG15 conjugation, each ISG15 N-terminally tagged with both S.tag and 3xFlag tag under the control of the ISG15 promoter. These cell lines are denoted as ISG15GG and ISG15AA cells (Fig. 2a). In ISG15GG cells, the double-tagged ISG15 protein is effectively conjugated to target proteins in an IFN-\u03b2-dependent manner (Fig. 2b). As is the case for endogenous ISG15, a larger amount of conjugates containing this double-tagged ISG15 was produced in wt virus-infected cells than in 67 virus-infected cells (Fig. 2c). SiRNA knockdown of the E1 enzyme (Ube1L) eliminated these conjugates, verifying that they are ISG15 conjugates. As further verification, we showed that these conjugates were not produced during wt virus infection of the IFN-treated ISG15AA cells (Fig. 2d). To determine whether the ISG15 conjugates in wt and 67 virus-infected cells are bound to the NS1B protein, the cell extracts from ISG15GG cells infected with wt virus (Fig. 2c, lane 1) and with 67 virus (Fig. 2c, lane 3) were immunoprecipitated with NS1B antibody, followed by immunoblots probed with Flag and NS1B antibodies (Fig. 2e). The result showed that wt NS1B protein, but not the 67 mutant NS1B protein, binds ISG15 conjugates.",

The resulting purified proteins were separated by SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four major bands identified by Colloidal blue staining (Fig. 3a). Mass spectrometry of these bands showed that they contained primarily viral proteins, specifically NP in bands 1 and 2, NS1B in band 3, and matrix protein (M1) in band 4. Based on molecular weights, the NP species in bands 1 and 2 are most likely NP-(ISG15)2 and NP-(ISG15)1, respectively. Mass spectrometry also identified the lysines (Ks) that are modified by ISG15 in these three proteins (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 1). Multiple Ks of NP are ISG15 attachment sites, six Ks in NP-(ISG15)2 and four other Ks in NP-(ISG15)1. Figure 3b shows the location of these sites on the crystal structure of influenza B virus NP24. Some of these sites are located at or near important functional regions of NP: K478 is located near the tail loop that mediates oligomerization; K139, K175, K245 and K279 are located at or close to the electropositive groove required for RNA binding; and K69 and K77 are located in the N terminus that functions as a nuclear localization signal25.",

As the first approach to identify which ISGylated viral protein is responsible for this defect(s), we determined the step(s) in virus replication that is inhibited by ISGylation in 67 virus-infected cells. IFN-\u03b2 pretreated A549 cells were infected with either wt or 67 virus at high multiplicity to infect all cells, thereby generating a single cycle of virus replication. Before IFN-\u03b2 treatment the cells were transfected with the siRNAs indicated in Fig. 4a. For the cells transfected with the control siRNA (lanes 1 and 2), the amounts of the viral haemagglutinin (HA), M1 and NP proteins produced in cells infected with the 67 virus were 30\u201340% lower than the amounts in cells infected with wt virus. Transfection of a USP18-specific siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) increased ISGylation and reduced the production of HA, M1 and NP proteins in 67 virus-infected cells by 60\u201385%, with little or no effect on the production of these viral proteins in wt virus-infected cells. A second USP18-specific siRNA had the same effect (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). In contrast, the level of the NS1B protein showed no decrease in 67 virus-infected cells; a likely explanation for the lack of effect on NS1B protein synthesis is presented in Supplementary Fig. 3. The effect of USP18 knockdown on HA, M1 and NP production in 67 virus-infected cells was reversed by co-transfection of an ISG15-specific siRNA (lanes 5 and 6) or an E1-specific siRNA (lanes 7 and 8), either of which eliminated ISG15 conjugation, establishing that this effect is caused by augmented ISGylation. This result is consistent with a recent study that established the proviral activity of USP18 via its deconjugation of ISG15 (ref. 26). Because the free ISG15 that remained after E1 knockdown did not inhibit viral protein production in 67 virus-infected cells (lane 8), we conclude that ISGylated proteins, not free intracellular ISG15, are responsible for the inhibition of viral protein production in 67 virus-infected cells.",

Viral RNPs are comprised of a single trimeric viral polymerase that binds to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of each vRNA (negative-sense) segment and cRNA (positive-sense) segment, and multiple NP proteins that coat the entirety of the rest of the vRNA and cRNA chains27. The formation of vRNPs requires NP oligomerization along the vRNA and cRNA chains2829. In this process, the tail loop of each NP molecule inserts into a cavity in the adjacent NP molecule243031. Even the small amount of ISGylated NP molecules produced in virus-infected cells could disrupt NP oligomerization in a dominant-negative manner, if only the loop or the insertion site, but not both is blocked by ISG15-modified Ks (Fig. 5a). For example, an ISGylated NP might bind to an unconjugated NP at the end of a nascent NP oligomer because the tail loop of the unconjugated NP is able to insert into the pocket in the ISGylated NP that is not blocked by ISG15-modified Ks. In contrast, the tail loop of the ISGylated NP might be blocked by ISG15-modified Ks from inserting into the pocket of an unconjugated incoming NP, thereby terminating oligomerization. Indeed, for the NP protein of influenza A virus, a mutant with a defective tail loop and an intact insertion cavity, or vice versa, has been shown to inhibit wt NP-mediated vRNP formation in a dominant-negative manner3233. We tested this hypothesis as described below.",

To verify that nuclear vRNP assembly is defective in 67 virus-infected cells, we devised treatment conditions (control siRNA and shorter IFN treatments) that resulted in the production of approximately equal amounts of nuclear NP in wt virus and 67 virus-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 5d, under these conditions all the nuclear NP in wt virus-infected cells was in vRNPs, whereas in 67 virus-infected cells 25% of the total NP was free at the expense of NP in vRNPs, confirming that vRNP formation in 67 virus-infected cells was inhibited relative to wt virus-infected cells.",

Purification was performed under non-denaturing conditions to preserve any interaction between ISGylated NP and unconjugated NP. An immunoblot probed with NP antibody (Fig. 5e) showed that the small amount of ISGylated NP in the nucleus of 67 virus-infected cells (predominately NP-(ISG15)2) was associated with a large excess of unconjugated NP, as predicted by the termination model of Fig. 5a. Oligomerization of NP was retained after RNase digestion to remove the associated viral RNA, as shown previously by others35. ISGylated NP was not detected in the nucleus of wt virus-infected cells, and instead was bound to wt NS1B in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ISGylated NP in the cytoplasm of 67 virus-infected cells was not bound to 67 mutant NS1B. The presence of cytoplasmic ISGylated NP in 67 virus-infected cells indicates that ISGylation also inhibits nuclear import, consistent with the presence of two ISGylation sites (K69 and K77) in the N-terminal region of NP that contains the nuclear localization signal (Fig. 3b).",

Elimination of these four NP ISGylation sites increased HA vRNA production in 67 virus-infected cells from 50 to 81% of the level in wt virus-infected cells (Fig. 5f). SiRNA knockdown of ISG15 increased the HA vRNA production in 67 virus-infected cells to the level in cells infected with the 67 virus containing these four K-to-R mutations (Supplementary Fig. 5), demonstrating that the difference in vRNA levels is due to ISGylation of these four K residues.

We showed that the viral NP protein is a primary target for ISGylation. We further demonstrated that the ISGylated NP proteins that are not bound to the mutant NS1B protein, although only a small percentage of the total NP proteins in mutant virus-infected cells, act in a dominant-negative manner to terminate the oligomerization of unconjugated NP molecules, resulting in incomplete NP oligomers containing ISGylated NP.

Inhibited viral RNA production results in inhibition of the synthesis of viral proteins, the primary targets for ISGylation, explaining the reduced level of ISGylation in 67 virus-infected cells.

            "text": "For NP proteins of both influenza A and B viruses, their oligomerization on the RNA template requires that the tail loop of each NP molecule is inserted into a cavity in the adjacent NP molecule243031. Previous studies of the NP protein of influenza A virus (NP-A) showed that a NP-A mutant that is defective in either the loop or insertion site could function as a dominant negative mutant to inhibit the oligomerization of wt NP-A, thereby inhibiting the viral RNA synthesis catalysed by viral RNPs3233. We would expect the same dominant-negative action by similar mutants of influenza B virus NP (NP-B) molecules, in light of the high structural similarity between the NP-A and NP-B proteins2431. In fact, our results indicate that ISGylation of the NP-B protein probably impedes the function of its loop: ISGylation of K478, which is located at the base of the loop, is one of the four ISGylations that function in the dominant-negative inhibition of viral RNA synthesis. These results are consistent with the model shown in Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6 for the dominant-negative inhibition of NP-B polymerization by ISGylated NP-B. However, our results indicate that ISGylation sites in different regions of NP-B other than its loop and insertion site also apparently function in the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, namely, K245 and K279, which are located in the RNA-binding surface, and K156, which is located in the body domain. It has been shown that mutant NP-A proteins that are defective in RNA binding can still be recruited to the viral RNA template by interacting with wt NP32. Consequently, any ISGylated NP-B molecules that are defective only in RNA binding might be recruited to nascent NP oligomers by wt NP. One possible consequence of incorporation of such ISGylated NP-B molecules is destabilizing the interaction of NP oligomers with viral RNA templates. The functional impact of the ISGylation at K156 is not known. Of note, the elimination of these four ISGylation site largely, but not completely, rescues ISGylation-mediated inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, suggesting that ISGylation of other K residues of NP may also impact viral RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "The preferential targeting of the NP protein for ISGylation in influenza B virus-infected cells differs from ISGylation targeting in cells infected with a 1972 H3N2 influenza A virus. The primary viral target in cells infected with this influenza A virus is the NS1A protein1314, and ISGylation of the NP-A protein was not detected13. This difference between influenza A and B viruses can be attributed at least in part to the fact that influenza A viruses do not encode a protein analogous to the influenza B virus NS1B protein that directly counters the antiviral action of ISGylation. Consequently, it is likely that influenza A virus, but not influenza B virus, would be under selective pressure to develop other mechanisms to circumvent the antiviral activity of ISGylation. It was noted by others that the total lysine (K) content of the proteins of several influenza B viruses was \u223c35% higher than that of several influenza A viruses11. The percentage of Ks in the NP-B proteins of all influenza B viruses is two-fold greater than that in the NP-A proteins of all influenza A viruses isolated from humans (Supplementary Fig. 7a), and none of these NP-A proteins contain Ks at the four sites corresponding to the ISGylation sites in the NP-B that function in the dominant-negative inhibition of viral RNA synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 7b). This difference between influenza A and B viruses is consistent with the hypothesis that ISGylation-driven evolution of influenza A viruses has led to a replacement of a substantial number of the Ks in their encoded proteins with Rs, thereby eliminating potential ISG15 modifications. In fact, ISGylation-driven evolution has likely occurred recently in H3N2 viruses. We previously showed that the K at position 41 of the NS1A protein is the primary target for ISGylation in cells infected with a H3N2 virus isolated in 1972, and that the replacement of this K with an R relieves the IFN-\u03b2 sensitivity of the virus13. Such a K-to-R change occurred in the NS1A proteins of H3N2 viruses isolated after 1986, demonstrating that H3N2 viruses isolated after 1986 have acquired a mutation in nature that essentially eliminates their susceptibility to inhibition by IFN-\u03b2-induced ISGylation5.",

            "text": "ISG15 can regulate the human immune response in multiple ways3536. There are two forms of ISG15 inside human cells, free and conjugated to target proteins. Recent studies found that free ISG15 could be proviral by interacting with, and thereby stabilizing USP18 to downregulate IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signalling18. Subsequently it was hypothesized that the main function of ISG15 system in human cells is to inhibit the inflammatory response via free ISG15, whereas ISGylation primarily functions in the regulation of the level of free ISG15 and does not exhibit any significant antiviral activity171820. However, we previously showed that ISGylation inhibits H3N2 influenza A viruses, and in the present study we clearly establish that IFN-\u03b2-induced ISGylation is a potent inhibitor of influenza B virus replication when the protective effect of the viral NS1B protein is eliminated. Free ISG15 does not have a significant role in this inhibition, as shown by our demonstration that the free ISG15 that remained after siRNA knockdown of the ISG15 E1 enzyme (UbE1L) did not inhibit viral protein production. Based on the present study and on the apparent ISGylation-driven evolution of H3N2 influenza A viruses, we think that it is reasonable to propose that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced ISGylation is a relatively ancient antiviral activity that viruses have overcome either by the action of a specific viral protein like NS1B that blocks the antiviral effects of ISGylation and/or by ISGylation-driven evolution of K-to-R mutations and/or other amino acid changes to eliminate ISGylation sites.",

This DNA fragment was a product of PCR-mediated ligation of two smaller fragments: one fragment contains a ISG15 promoter sequence (bases -740 to 0) that was amplified from HeLa genomic DNA; the other fragment encodes S-3F-ISG15 generated by PCR-mediated addition of 3xFlag-S sequence to an ISG15-encoding sequence.

After selection with medium containing 1 \u03bcg ml\u22121 puromycin, individual clones were selected, expanded, and the clone showing the strongest IFN-\u03b2-dependent induction of S-3F-ISG15 as well as its conjugates was used for virus infection experiments.

For immunoblots, cells were lysed in high-salt RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor and 0.5 units \u03bcl\u22121 benzonase (Sigma), then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation. The extracts were analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated Abs. For RT\u2013PCR analysis, cells were harvested in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was purified by Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo research). Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) with either oligo(dT) primer (for mRNA) or influenza B virus gene-specific primers (for vRNA). Real-time PCR was carried out on the ViiA 7 Real-time PCR system (Invitrogen). For the measurements of HA, M, NA, NP RNA, 2 \u00d7 FastStart Universal Probe Master (Rox) (Roche) and Universal Probe Library (Roche) were used and human ACTB (Beta Actin) endogenous control (Applied Biosystems) was used as the internal control. Universal Probes (Roche) used were: #118 for HA and NP, #29 for M and #14 for NA. For the measurement of NS RNA, because of no suitable Universal Probe Library(Roche), SYBR Green based quantitative PCR with melting curve analysis was employed using Power SYBR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The same method was also applied to assaying NP and Actin RNA in the same experiments. The data were analysed using the comparative delta-delta Ct method. The primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 2.",

Protein peptides were then extracted from the gel and analysed on a Q-Eactive mass spectrometer for high resolution MS and MS/MS data. The generated data were searched against human protein database and influenza B protein assembly with SEQUEST and the target-decoy strategy to filter data to a 1% false discovery rates.
