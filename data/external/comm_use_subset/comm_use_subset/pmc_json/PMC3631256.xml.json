Some viruses are encoded within spatially restricted genomes, and being able to map multiple functions to a stretch of protein, facilitated by structural reorganization [22], may be advantageous. The ability to rapidly acquire small motifs made accessible within disordered stretches of protein that manipulate host proteins by interacting with them may also be beneficial under certain circumstances. Since during evolution viruses often cross between quite different hosts, the evolvability20 of a virus may be an important feature in certain families. Consequently, disordered regions may enhance the rate of emergence of new phenotypes, in addition to the range of potential phenotypes. The use of compact interfaces allows increased redundancy by allowing functionality to be mediated by a set of short disordered regions (e.g. the Late domains of retroviral Gag proteins) rather than on a single globular interface, resulting in increased evolutionary robustness of viral proteins [10] Thus, a deeper understanding of the role of intrinsically disordered regions in viruses is important if we are to fully understand the relationships between protein sequence and function, and also to understand the relationship between overall proteome organization and long-term evolutionary strategies of different viruses.",

Convergently evolved examples for more than 50 of the \u223c150 eukaryotic motif types annotated in the ELM database [23] have been experimentally validated in viral proteins [10]. These motifs have roles in manipulating cell signaling, targeting host proteins for proteosomal degradation, directing viral proteins to the correct subcellular localisations, altering transcription of host proteins and deregulating cell cycle checkpoints [10]. For example, the Nef protein of HIV-1 has distinctive motifs mediating interaction with the human proteins NMT1, PCAS-1, Hck, beta-COP, and AP. The Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 protein, has motifs required for binding to TRAF, BTrCP, JAK3 and TRADD proteins, that collectively modulating NF-kB signaling. The Adenovirus E1A protein contains multiple motifs to allow the virus to alter the host gene expression [10].",

SLiMs can be easily and rapidly evolved de novo, whereas evolution of a globular interface for viral host protein interaction may not evolve as quickly. Viruses can acquire functional globular domains from their host, however, horizontally transferred genes are typically acquired only by larger viruses that can incorporate a stolen host gene into their genome without having to jettison other proteins that are vital for independent viral function [24]. Therefore, very small viruses may have the most to gain from the multifunctional flexibility and evolutionary fluidity of disordered regions. On the other hand, their genomes may be so constrained to encode structural proteins with largely ordered domains, that may leave little room for accessory proteins with disordered regions to evolve. Intriguingly, some viruses can avoid such restrictions by encoding two or more overlapping proteins in different reading frames. We anticipated that these competing selection constraints would result in different distributions of disordered regions among different viral groups.",

There is a strong between-family variability in intrinsic disorder, with mean intrinsic disorder varying from 2.9% to 29.5%, with a standard deviation of mean family intrinsic disorder of 6.4%. There is considerable variability within families also as summarized by the standard deviation for each family (Table 2; more detailed information on the range and interquartile range for each family is given in Table S5). Some families show more noticeable variation among their members (\u03c3D >5%) namely Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Tymoviridae, Retroviridae and Herpesviridae, while for other families, the extent of protein disorder is very similar across all members.",

Since distributions of disorder are not normal, we used the non-parametric Spearman's correlation coefficient (\u03c1) to quantify how the rank of disorder and the rank of genome size are associated (Fig. 4: (; \u03c1 = \u22120.46, p = 0.002).

Table 3 suggests that both effects are present. Firstly, there is a substantial correlation of four-fold degenerate site base composition with predicted protein disorder, in spite of the fact that base composition preferences at these sites do not alter the amino acid sequences. This indicates that base composition is indeed a substantial driver of the extent of predicted protein disorder. The stronger correlations seen for total base composition indicate that it is likely that selection pressures favouring or avoiding protein disorder also have an additional impact on base composition.",

Thus, to account for the effects of base composition, we then fitted two regression models that accounted for both base composition and genome size. In the first, we regressed disorder on base composition. In the second, we regressed disorder on base composition and on genome size. To assess how much variation in disorder was accounted for by genome size (once base composition is allowed for), we estimated the difference in the variance accounted for by the two models (difference of the adjusted R2 values for each model).

Family seems to be the single strongest predictor of disorder (74%). Thus, it appears that the most important determinant of how much disorder a virus will have is the family to which it belongs. While a substantial component of this may be down to what broad viral type the family belongs to (36%), clearly there are additional factors. Genome size modeled as a single variable across all viruses adds comparatively little to this model, nor does it add much when other covariates are included (Table S3). This is not too surprising, given that the correlations within some families are positive but within other families are negative (Table 2), so that they will cancel out within the overall model. Overall, over 80% of disorder variation can be accounted for by family and base composition. Since we know that genome size is correlated both negatively and positively with disorder within certain families, it is likely that some of the remaining 17% of variance can be accounted for by family-specific genome size effects, as well as other factors. Thus, between family variability is striking, but there remains substantial within family variability. It appears from these models that individual viral families have distinctive degrees of disorder, most likely reflecting both adaptive and mutational factors.

One broad survey of disorder in viruses with a similar interest to our study [9] gave some consideration to this range of variation in viral disorder. They highlighted that certain proteins have high levels of disorder, pointing out that more than 20 small viruses have over 50% disorder, and that for larger viruses disorder ranges typically between 20 % and 40%. However, they also noted that certain viruses have very low disorder, such as the human coronavirus NL63 (estimated 7.3% disordered residues [9]).

We might, therefore, have expected that viruses would follow their hosts, a trend discussed in a previous survey of viruses [9]. However, from our analysis, the marked viral variation does not clearly or even substantially follow these main phylogenetic trends of their hosts. Thus, the large double stranded poxviruses and herpesviruses showed markedly differing levels of predicted disorder, in spite of the similarity of their hosts. The predicted disorder among viruses of different hosts showed no clear pattern, with prokaryotes having both high disorder (eubacteria, 17.9%) and low disorder (archaea, 6.3%) groups, and with similar variation among the viruses of various eukaryotic hosts (Table 4). Clearly, a simplistic correlation of disorder with \u201ccomplexity\u201d does not fit well with any measures of either viral or host complexity, and it is likely that the distribution of disorder is influenced by multiple factors. Such factors may well include aspects of latency, virulence, life cycle and selection pressures among mutated viral copies within a cell [31].",

            "text": "Overall, smaller genomes tend to have more disordered residues, but this weak trend is largely absent when base composition is taken into account. We hypothesized prior to commencing this study that this would be the case, on the grounds that disordered extended proteins have a larger interaction surface with which they may come in contact with, and modify the function of, host proteins [32]. However, this effect was rather small over all viruses, and was largely removed when correcting for base composition as a potential explanatory factor. When we looked within viral families, we found much more striking correlations between genome size and protein disorder. In a number of families, there was a clear negative correlation between disorder and genome size (even after allowing for base composition), consistent with our original hypothesis, but in a few families there was a positive correlation. How can we account for this? We conclude that there are family-specific determinants of disorder, that relate in some families in part to genome size, in ways that have yet to be identified. Such factors could include mutation rates, pathogenicity and preference for transient versus persistent infection, which may alter the requirement for accessory host interaction proteins. Relationships between genome size and disorder among some bacteria may be consistent with simplification for smaller genomes and less disordered proteins [33], although it is difficult to determine causation. However, without a much fuller knowledge regarding the adaptive and non-adaptive constraints on a wide range of different viruses, it is difficult to identify the precise components of different viral evolutionary lifestyles that are most likely to have given rise to such strikingly different degrees of protein disorder.",

Inspection of the most disordered proteins (Table S7) reveals that they have roles not only in cellular signaling, such as the HIV1 Nef protein, but also in viral structure and movement. The apparent relationship between disorder and base composition suggests that the pattern of mutation, which is the likely main driver of base composition, itself has an influence on the extent of protein disorder. It is unclear to what extent the mutation rate itself may be a partial driver of the extent of disorder [35]: while pox viruses appear to have more rapid mutation rates and lower disorder compared to herpes viruses [36], these two observations may or may not be linked by direct or indirect causation. A gold standard set of mutation rates for different viruses would help to address this important question, but no such dataset of viral mutation rates exists, and mutation rates cannot be inferred from sequence data as there is no global outgroup alignable to viral proteins shared across many families.",

Amongst the large Pox and Herpes viruses, it is noticeable that although there may be a similar number of documented instances of gene hijacking amongst both groups [37], the much more disordered Herpesviruses have noticeably more documented instances of linear motif mimicry [10].

Such critical interaction points within disordered sequences may play a role both in viral structure and in virus-host interaction (Table 4). Our study provides a clear framework in which to understand the background distribution of disorder in different viruses. This will provide important insights in targeting the most interesting disordered regions. For example, regions of disorder that occur in viruses which tend in general to avoid disorder may be of particular interest, since such disordered regions may play key roles in viral function.",
