            "text": "In this study, CPMO1 and CPMO2 were designed to bind to the AUG region of ORF1 and ORF2 of CHIKV genomic RNA, respectively (Fig. 1). Both CPMO target sequences were structurally accessible with no complex secondary folding (Fig. 1a) and the sequences were also predicted to be highly conserved among different geographical strains of CHIKV (Fig. 1b; Table 1). Quantification of cell viability was done following incubation with a combination of PMOs and Endo-Porter (EP) delivery reagent, EP or individual CPMO on confluent HeLa cells for at least 24 h. More than 96% of the cells remained viable across PMO + EP concentration range at 24 h post-treatment (supplementary Figure S1a). Consistently, cell viablity was also close to 100% for EP control treatment (supplementary Figure S1b) and at least 94% was observed for CPMO treatment at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-treatment (Fig. 2a). Taken together, this suggests that EP delivery, the designed CPMO and their combination had no apparent toxcity on HeLa cells. In order to visualize CPMO intracellular distribution following cellular uptake, cells were incubated with fluoresceinated-CPMOs (10 \u03bcM) and EP (6 \u03bcM) for 24 h, stained with DAPI dye and observed under fluorescence microscopy. None of the mock-treated and EP-treated cells have any visible fluorescence signal under FITC channel (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast, 99% of CPMO1 and 97% of CPMO2-treated cells showed diffused fluorescence occuring individually or freely in clusters around the cytosol, thereby suggesting an efficient EP-mediated cellular uptake of CPMO. Next, CPMO-treated cells were subjected to CHIKV infection (M.O.I. 0.1) in an attempt to investigate whether intracellular stability of CPMO is affected during post-CHIKV infection. Fluorescence signals of CPMO1 and CPMO2 were similarly detected in at least 84% of CHIKV-infected cells at day 1, 2 and 3 p.i (Fig. 2d). Similar to post-treatment, CPMO signals were only located in the cell cytosol and most of them colocalized with CHIKV E2 protein stain. This suggests that CPMO could be distributed to the Endoplasmic reticulum where it inhibits CHIKV protein expression. Though CPMO signals were comparatively reduced at day 3 p.i., they have remained intracellularly stable among CHIKV-infected cells as observed by the evident fluorescence signal.",

Post-infection time-points, day 1, 2 and 3 were chosen based on CHIKV growth kinetic in HeLa cells, where the highest CHIKV titre was produced at day 3 p.i (supplementary Figure S2). Mock, EP and sCPMOs treatments produced similarly high levels of CHIKV titre from Day 1\u20133 p.i (Fig. 3a). Relative to mock-treated control, CPMO1 (10 \u03bcM) significantly reduced CHIKV titre by 2 log10 PFU/ml at day 1 p.i and 3 log10 PFU/ml at day 2 and 3 p.i. In contrast, pre-treatment with equal concentration of CPMO2 achieved only a 1 log10 PFU/ml reduction in CHIKV titre at day 2 and 3 p.i. In parallel with quantification of virus titre, the total cell lysates of CPMO or sCPMO treated-cells were harvested at all three days p.i for Western blot detection of CHIKV E2 and nsP3 protein expression level. In mock, EP or sCPMO-treated cells, increasing level of expression of CHIKV E2 (Fig. 3b,c) and nsP3 protein (Fig. 3d,e) were observed from day 1 to day 3 p.i, correlating to the increasing virus titres (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, viral E2 and nsP3 protein level was almost completely suppressed at day 1\u20133 p.i in cells pre-treated with 10 \u03bcM of CPMO1. Similarly, CPMO2-treated cells showed strong reduction in both E2 and nsP3 protein expression relative to CHIKV-infected control (Fig. 3b\u2013e). However, CPMO2 treatment seemed less effective in silencing the production of E2 protein and infectious CHIKV titre relative to CPMO1. Taken together, these findings highlight the strong antiviral efficacy of CPMO1 against CHIKV replication.",

SINV was used in this study as it belongs to the Togaviridae family similar to CHIKV while DENV is a representative member of the flaviviruses. Quantification of virus titre by viral plaque assays demonstrated no significant difference in SINV or DENV titre for CPMO1-treatment relative to the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3f,g). In support of this data, homology alignment of CPMO1 target sequence in CHIKV RNA (GenBank; FJ445502) to SINV (GenBank; NC_001547) and DENV genome (GenBank; M29095.1) revealed no significant similarity (data not shown).

Mock-infected HeLa cells maintained healthy cellular morphology with intact organelles such as a well-defined nucleus, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4a). The cell surface membrane was smooth and there was no sign of CHIKV virions. In CHIKV-infected (Fig. 4b\u2013d), EP- (Fig. 4e) and sCPMO1-treated cells (Fig. 4f), extensive virus replication has occurred as indicated by the formation of numerous CHIKV replication complexes, namely, the cytopathic vacuoles type II (CPV-II, arrowheads) in the cytosol (Fig. 4d). During the late phase of CHIKV replication, infected cells showed assembly and budding of mature CHIKV virions from cell surface and intercellular junctions (Fig. 4c,e,f). In contrast, CPMO1-treated cells showed no sign of CHIKV replication with the absence of CPVs at say 3 p.i. (Fig. 4g,h). The mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum remained intact and there was no virus budding from cell surface and in between cell junctions, similar to the mock-treated cells (Fig. 4a). These ultrastructural analysis further strengthen our finding that treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 has effectively prevented CHIKV infection within the cells.",

            "text": "Having shown that CPMO1 could strongly suppress cellular CHIKV replication, we further assessed the antiviral efficacy of CPMO1v in suitable murine model (6-day old BALB/c mice) that was previously established for CHIKV infection in our research laboratory. In this 6-day old BALB/c model, mice succumbed to CHIKV infection with a range of 10\u201365% lethality in day 5\u20139 p.i. relative to mock-infected wildtype control group. There could be variability in survival due to the development of innate immunity that help mice to overcome lethality. Therefore, it is more notable for the use of this mouse model to analyze the acute phase of CHIKV infection, where the latter was well-characterized by high viremia, virus burden and pathogenesis in CHIKV-targeted tissues including the hind limb muscles, liver, spleen and brain (data not shown). In this study, Vivo-PMOs, namely, CPMO1v and scrambled CPMO1v (sCPMO1v), were synthesized where their fluorescence dye was replaced with an octaguanidium dendrimer to mediate effective in vivo delivery to mice tissues. Following CPMO1v or sCPMO1v administration via intraperitoneal (i.p) injection at 5, 10 and 15 \u03bcg/g to our murine model, serum Lactate dehydragenase (LDH) level in the mice remained low and insignificant compared to the LDH positive control. Activity of LDH is commonly used as a stable biomarker in cytotoxicity assay5152. Based on this finding, we inferred an absence of dose-dependent toxicity from vivo-PMO treatment (Fig. 5a). Next, the antiviral efficacy of CPMO1v at 5 \u03bcg/g or 15 \u03bcg/g was investigated where the compound was administered to the mice for two consecutive days, followed by CHIKV infection and subsequent treatment with CPMO1v for two more consecutive dose at 18 h and 42 h p.i. A dose-inhibition effect was observed where 5 \u03bcg/g of CPMO1v protected 75% of the mice from CHIKV-induced morbidity and 15 \u03bcg/g has further enhanced the survival of all mice for two weeks p.i. (Fig. 5b). In contrast, PBS- and sCPMO1v control groups showed 65% survival at Day 3 p.i. and 50% survival at Day 4 p.i, respectively. On average daily basis, 15 \u03bcg/g CPMO1v-treatment also conferred the mice healthy weight gain similar to mock-infected mice while 5 \u03bcg/g CPMO1v-treated mice showed retarded growth similar to PBS- and sCPMO1v-treatment groups (Fig. 5c). As this mouse model did not provide evaluation of absolute lethality, quantification of CHIKV titre in mice serum and several organs was further evaluated at day 2 p.i. to analyze the protective efficacy of CPMO1v during the acute phase of CHIKV infection. Indeed, strong suppression of CHIKV production in various tissues of CPMO1v-treated mice relative to PBS- and sCPMO1v-treated groups (Fig. 5d\u2013h). In line with high potency of protection seen in survival study, CPMO1v given at 15 \u03bcg/g had the most notable reduction of viremia (2.83 log10; Fig. 5d), CHIKV load in the spleen (3.85 log10; Fig. 5e), liver (2.09 log10; Fig. 5f), brain (2.45 log10; Fig. 5g) and limbs (2.91 log10; Fig. 5h). Taken together, these data showed that the administration of 15 \u03bcg/g CPMO1v strongly protects against CHIKV disease in our murine model during the acute phase.",

Our previous study, which utilized a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct, demonstrated the strong potential of antisense molecules in suppressing CHIKV replication in HeLa cells56. However, treatment-induced toxicity and the high susceptibility of siRNA to intracellular degradation posed as limitations in furthering the development of shRNA for pre-clinical applications5758. In this regard, an improved antisense technology with desirable biochemical characteristics is required. PMOs are neutral DNA-like oligomers made up of non-ionic phosphorodiamidate backbone. This unique construct allows PMO to possess high cellular stability and excellent safety profile3659. In this study, we have designed two PMOs, CPMO1 and CPMO2, that targets CHIKV RNA genome and evaluated them for their toxicity and inhibitory effect against CHIKV replication both in vitro and in vivo. We found that CPMOs exert no cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of the highest dose 15 \u03bcg/g CPMO1v or sCPMO1v to our established murine model (6-day old neonate BALB/c mouse) also showed an absence of PMO-induced toxicity and lack of behavioural abnormality. Similarly, safe pharmacological profile of PMO in cell cultures and mice have also been observed in other PMO studies on flaviviruses replication4560. To enhance in vivo delivery, CPMO1v evaluated in our neonate murine model was conjugated to an octaguanidinium dendrimer. This arginine-rich peptide has been well-validated for excellent systemic delivery of vivo-morpholino into a wide-array of mice tissues, albeit a reduced penetrating ability into the brain due to the low permeability of the blood-brain barrier6162. Here, we observed significant reduction of CHIKV load in the liver, spleen, skeletal muscles as well as the brain following i.p treatment of CPMO1v. This suggests CPMO1v could have been favorably taken up into these organs and therefore prophylactically protecting the tissues against CHIKV replication. To strengthen this speculation, further investigation on CPMO1v biodistribution using bioanalytical tools63 can be carried out.",

            "text": "Based on previous studies, HeLa cells are well-established to be highly permissive to CHIKV entry and replication566465. Thus in this study, HeLa cells were appropriated as the human cell model to address the efficacy of CPMOs against CHIKV replication. In addition, the CPMOs could have broad-spectrum activity as each of them targets a highly conserved AUG region sequence among CHIKV strains of different lineages. Furthermore, CPMO1 was CHIKV-specific as it did not cross-react with SINV and DENV replication. Strong efficacy of CPMO1 in suppressing CHIKV replication in HeLa cells was demonstrated collectively in viral plaque assays, Western blot analysis and ultrastructural analysis. In contrast, CPMO2 only caused a reduction of 1 log10 PFU/ml in CHIKV titre (Fig. 3a,b). This could be attributed to the difference in CPMO target sequence. During the early stage of CHIKV replication, the non-structural proteins (nsP1\u20134) form a viral replication complex that mediates the synthesis of a full-length negative-strand RNA34. At late stage of CHIKV replication, the negative-strand RNA then directs the synthesis of positive-strand genomic RNA required for new virions formation and production of structural proteins. Here, we postulate that CPMO1 could have a dual blocking effect, first, on the synthesis of CHIKV non-structural viral polyprotein, followed by a secondary inhibition on downstream positive-strand RNA synthesis. As CPMO1 targets upstream of the AUG codon in the first ORF, it blocks the translation of CHIKV genomic RNA to non-structural viral polyprotein. Indeed, our findings indicate significant reduction in CHIKV titre and knockdown of CHIKV E2 protein synthesis sustained from day 1\u20133 p.i, suggesting that CPMO1 suppresses non-structural protein synthesis at early stage of CHIKV replication (prior to day 1 p.i.) and this consequently reduced CHIKV structural protein synthesis and infectious virions production at late stage of CHIKV replication (day 2\u20133 p.i.). On the other hand, CPMO2 targets the AUG region in the second ORF and this hinders the translation of CHIKV subgenomic RNA to structural proteins, namely, the Capsid, E1 and E2. Therefore, CPMO2 is likely to exhibit its inhibitory activity at the late stage of CHIKV replication. Indeed, significant CPMO2-mediated reduction in CHIKV titre was observed only at day 2 and 3 p.i. and this was accompanied with a moderate decrease in E2 protein production at day 1\u20133 p.i. At these experimental time-points, negative sense RNA production could have occurred extensively and CPMO2 may not be sufficiently effective to silence all structural protein synthesis. Consequently, the inhibition was seen lower than that achieved by CPMO1, which can target an early step of CHIKV replication. Based on this interpretation, we can also deduce that CPMO is sequence-dependent for its antiviral activity. The control sCPMOs have neither caused non-specific reduction in CHIKV titre nor drastic decrease in E2 protein level. This signifies that for future studies requiring specific silencing of a stage of CHIKV replication, more CPMO candidates can be similarly designed and screened.",

Neonate mice were pre-treated with CPMO1v followed by two additional dose after CHIKV challenge. Survival study demonstrated that 15 \u03bcg/g CPMO1v conferred 100% survival and normal daily weight gain over 14 days p.i. In contrast, PBS- and sCPMO1v-treated mice were susceptible to CHIKV disease where these mice had poor weight gain, paralysis of single hind limb on day 2 p.i. and their mortality was significantly reduced to 65% and 50%, respectively, at the end of two weeks. Other murine studies have reported that CHIKV primarily infects the liver, muscles, joints, spleen and brain, displaying a tropism characteristic of CHIKV pathogenesis in human535455. Thus in our murine model, quantification of viremia, virus load and examining histopathologic changes are necessary to further investigate the antiviral efficacy of CPMO1v. Here, we found that viremia was significantly reduced by 2.8 log in mice treated with 15 \u03bcg/g CPMO1v as well as at least 2 log reduction of virus load in the spleen, liver, brain and limbs, collectively. Skeletal muscles of the hind limbs and liver of CPMO1v-treated mice displayed healthy tissue morphology with no sign of CHIKV-induced degenerative damage (Fig.6g,h,o,p). Comparatively, gross histopathologic changes and strong signal of CHIKV antigen distribution were observed in the muscle fibres and liver tissue of PBS- and sCPMO1v-treated mice, as consistent with other CHIKV murine models established53545566. In summary, these findings provide compelling evidence on the strong efficacy of CPMO1v against CHIKV replication. We postulate that the specific translational-blocking activity of CPMO1v on CHIKV non-structural and structural protein synthesis has exerted a histological protection in mice against the onset of CHIKV pathogenesis.",

With these findings, it may be necessary to evaluate the robustness of CPMO1 against resistant virus mutant generation as well as the therapeutic efficacy of CPMO1 administration after CHIKV challenge. Nevertheless, our study revealed a proof-of-concept on the antiviral efficacy and sequence-dependent specificity of morpholino against CHIKV replication. In the long run, further evaluation is required to develop morpholino into a translational antiviral therapy for CHIKV disease.",

(b) Western blot detection of CHIKV E2 protein (50 kDa) expression in total cell lysate of mock-treated, Endo-Porter (EP-inf), scrambled CPMO, or CPMO treated and infected cells across day 1, 2 and 3 p.i. (D1, D2, D3). (c) Quantification of relative band density of CHIKV E2 protein. (d) Western blot analysis and (e) quantification of CHIKV nsP3 protein (78 kDa) level in total cell lysate. \u03b2-actin (42 kDa) serves as loading control. Gel image presented was cropped from several original images and all gels were electrophoresed under the same conditions. Treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 10 \u03bcM did not produce specific inhibition against (f) Sindbis and (g) Dengue virus replication (M.O.I. 0.1 infection) when compared to the non-treated and scrambled CPMO1 controls. Error bars are indicative of mean \u00b1 s.e.m. expressed from three independent set of experiments. Statistical analysis is performed using one-way ANOVA across all groups followed by unpaired one-tailed t-test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.001).",
