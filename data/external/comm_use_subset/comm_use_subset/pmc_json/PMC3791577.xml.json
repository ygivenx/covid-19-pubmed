It is one of the major endemic problems in Latin America and ranks as the third most important parasitic disease in the world after malaria and schistosomiasis [2]. An estimate of the number of T. cruzi infections by states in Mexico was made that indicated that the calculated number of potentially affected people is 5.5 million [3]. Several studies describing the seroprevalence in dogs of this country have been conducted and importantly demonstrated a direct correlation with the seropositivity in humans. The seroprevalence in the dog population ranges between 1.6% and 21% depending on the geographical region [4\u20138] suggesting that dogs may be domestic reservoir hosts and help to maintain human transmission of T. cruzi when dogs and humans cohabit with vector insects, creating thus a public health problem [9].",

Prevention of T. cruzi transmission is mainly through the control of vector populations, control of blood transfusion and organ transplantation, and monitoring children from chagasic mothers. However, it is necessary to consider other alternatives, such as the development of vaccines that would be key to improve the control of CD. The development and establishment of regulatory immunization schemes have enabled controlling successfully and even eradicating many diseases worldwide. DNA vaccination represents a promising strategy to attempt to prevent many conditions associated with virulent microorganisms, including obligate and facultative intracellular parasites whose ability to reside within the host cells sustains their resistance to the host's defense mechanisms for longer periods [20].

Additionally, survival was 75% in TcSSP4 gene-immunized/infected mice and 100% in those immunized with TcSP gene and then infected. These studies demonstrated protection during the chronic phase of the disease as revealed by the histological analysis showing that immunization diminishes cardiac damage caused by the H8 strain of T. cruzi (MHOM/MX/1992/H8 (T. cruzi)) [21\u201323].",

Three different sites of heart walls from the top, middle, and bottom of the tissue were analyzed: subepicardium, myocardium, and subendocardium. Images were obtained through a Bio-Doc-It Imaging System image analyzer (UVP, LLC, USA). The severity of inflammation in affected tissue sections was scored on a scale from 1 to 4. A score of 1 indicated one or less foci of inflammatory cells/field (400x); 2, more than one inflammatory foci/field; 3, generalized coalescing of foci of inflammation or disseminated inflammation with minimal cell necrosis and retention of tissue integrity, and 4, diffuse inflammation, with severe tissue necrosis, interstitial edema, hemorrhage, and loss of tissue integrity.",

This event indicates that infection with the T. cruzi Ninoa strain in the canine model induced splenomegaly in CD chronic phase similarly to other more virulent strains in humans and dogs [18, 37], and the DNA vaccination with parasite TcSP and TcSSP4 genes showed a significant amelioration of splenic pathology, as assessed by the splenic index. This finding correlates directly with splenic tissue damage during the chronic stage of the disease. Parasite TcSP and TcSSP4 genes encode a trans-sialidase and an amastigote specific-protein, which are expressed in all forms of the parasite and in trypomastigote to amastigote transition forms, respectively, stimulating a strong humoral and cellular response during BALB/c mice infection and preventing pathological manifestations of chronic CD [21, 22].

In contrast, the dogs immunized with the TcSSP4 gene at the same dose and then infected exhibited a heart index similar to that of the healthy non-immunized group, and probably TcSSP4, the amastigote specific protein, encoded by the TcSSP4 gene, had a partial protective role during CCC likely because this gene induces immunity against the stage-specific surface antigen present on the intracellular form. Further studies of immunizations with the two plasmids in combination are required to determine if there is a possible synergistic effect. ",
