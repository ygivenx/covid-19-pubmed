            "text": "Positive-strand RNA viruses are common causative agents of human disease, including the common cold, myocarditis, encephalitis, hepatitis, and paralytic poliomyelitis [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Poliovirus (PV) has been the subject of a largely-successful global eradication campaign [8,9]. These efforts have relied on the live attenuated oral poliovirus virus vaccine (OPV), and sustained in the developed world by inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) [10]. Historically, OPV has been the favored treatment in the majority of countries, owing in part to its ease of use and lower cost [10]. However, most developed countries have transitioned to IPV because of OPV\u2019s risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPV) [11]. OPV is generally comprised of three vaccine strains empirically developed by Albert Sabin and colleagues [12,13,14]. The three Sabin vaccine strains all have mutations located in the virus\u2019 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which reduces the ability of PV to translate its RNA template within the neuronal cell [13,14]. Other mutations outside the IRES, including those within protein coding regions, may also contribute to viral attenuation [15,16,17,18,19,20]. The most abundant strain of the vaccine, Sabin I, has 57 mutations in its RNA sequence compared to the parental Mahoney strain, leading to 21 amino acid changes in viral proteins [21]. Four of these amino acid changes occur in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is responsible for genome replication. We have previously shown that recombinant PV (i.e., Mahoney background) encoding the Sabin-derived T362I mutation in the RdRp has a statistically significant reduction in viral virulence, likely because the T362I RdRp is a more error-prone polymerase than the \u201cwild-type\u201d (WT) enzyme [22]. These results are intriguing, and might suggest that the Sabin I RdRp also contributes to viral attenuation. Such findings would be intriguing in light of the suggestion that viruses encoding RdRp enzymes with altered fidelity might serve as live, attenuated vaccine candidates [23].",

            "text": "PV RdRp has a highly-conserved canonical cupped right-hand structure with palm, thumb, and finger subdomains (Figure 1) [24]. There are seven conserved structural motifs, five of which (A to E) are located in the palm subdomain [25,26]. The T362I amino acid change occurs on structural motif D, which we have proposed is important in phosphodiester bond formation and nucleotide discrimination [27,28]. More specifically, motif D contains a highly-conserved lysine residue (Lys359 in PV RdRp), which we have proposed acts as a general acid to protonate the \u03b2-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide to facilitate bond breakage between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-phosphates and create a better pyrophosphate leaving group [28,29]. We have suggested that the active-site loop containing Lys359 fluctuates between \u201cclosed\u201d and \u201copen\u201d conformations in which Lys359 is positioned and out-of-position for catalysis, respectively. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies are consistent with this proposal [22,29,30]. We have shown that the Sabin-derived T362I amino acid substitution alters the motions of motif D, allowing the enzyme to fluctuate more readily into a closed conformation even in the presence of incorrect nucleotide, leading to a less faithful polymerase [22].",

The Y73H substitution has been shown to interfere with the initiation of RNA synthesis [19], which might help to explain why PV encoding the Y73H substitution is attenuated [17,20]. The D53N, Y73H, and T362I substitutions also contribute to the temperature sensitivity of the Sabin I vaccine [15,16,17,31]. The Sabin substitutions may also affect each other. Our previous molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that the T362I amino acid substitution induces different nanosecond timescale motions in distant parts of the enzyme, including around Asp53 [22]. We have also previously noted anti-correlated motions between motif D and the \u03b1-helix containing Tyr73 [32]. It is also noted that the helices containing Tyr73 and Lys250 are packed closely together (Figure 1). Altogether, these results suggest that there are structural and dynamic connections between the various Sabin sites, which may contribute to the function of the Sabin I RdRp.",

Recombinant PV encoding the T362I substitution was also attenuated in a mouse model of PV [22]. These results suggested that the Sabin I RdRp may also have altered fidelity and that its function may contribute to the attenuation of the Sabin I vaccine strain. One way to probe polymerase fidelity is to perform single nucleotide incorporation assays using purified enzyme [34,35]. As such, we produced a modified RdRp enzyme encoding all four amino acid substitutions (i.e., D53N/Y73H/K250E/T362I). To ensure that the Sabin I RdRp was amenable to the single nucleotide incorporation assays, we first examined its ability to interact with RNA. We have previously shown that the T362I substitution does not significantly weaken interactions between enzyme and RNA compared to WT RdRp [22].",

To explore this idea, we attempted to encode recombinant PV (in Mahoney background) with the four substitutions occurring in the Sabin I polymerase. Unfortunately, this variant was not genetically stable and virus recovered from HeLa cells only retained the corresponding D53N/Y73H/T362I mutations. These results suggested that the K250E substitution was not stable in the Mahoney background, in the absence of other Sabin I mutations. Nonetheless, there was a possibility that the triple variant D53N/Y73H/T362I could be used in place of the Sabin variant for further biological characterization. Unfortunately for those studies, the D53N/Y73H/T362I variant had different sugar and nucleobase selectivities than the Sabin I variant (Table 1), and so we did not proceed with cell-based or mouse-based studies. There were also functional differences between the D53N/Y73H/T362I variant and T362I and WT RdRp enzymes (Table 1).

Although the changes induced by the single substitutions were relatively small, we note that small changes in RdRp fidelity can lead to biological effects (e.g., [37,38,39,40]). All three variants (i.e., D53N, Y73H, and K250E) were a little less selective against nucleotides with incorrect sugars compared to WT RdRp. However, there were different effects for nucleobase selection.

Another way of characterizing protein variants is to analyze the thermodynamic effects of the amino acid substitutions. Similar to the methods of Fersht and Mildvan [41,42,43], we determined \u0394\u0394G values where \u0394\u0394GX = RT ln((kpol/Kd,app)X/(kpol/Kd,app)WT) where X is a particular enzyme variant (N.B. in our analysis, variants that have a lower kpol/Kd,app value than WT enzyme will yield a negative \u0394\u0394G value). In the case of the Sabin I variant, there were small thermodynamic effects for AMP and GMP incorporation, but more substantial effects for 2\u2032-dAMP incorporation (Figure 4a). This type of analysis also allows us to determine if the four amino acid substitutions were additive (i.e., \u0394\u0394GSabin = \u0394\u0394GD53N + \u0394\u0394GY73H + \u0394\u0394GK250E + \u0394\u0394GT362I) or non-additive. Intriguingly, the amino acid substitutions were non-additive for AMP, 2\u2032-dAMP, and GMP incorporation (Figure 4a). In fact, adding together the thermodynamic effects of the four single amino acid substitutions would predict a more catalytically-efficient Sabin enzyme (i.e., \u0394\u0394G is negative) for AMP and GMP incorporation, but less catalytically efficient for 2\u2032-dAMP incorporation (i.e., \u0394\u0394GD53N + \u0394\u0394GY73H + \u0394\u0394GK250E + \u0394\u0394GT362I > \u0394\u0394GSabin). However, it should be pointed out that these differences are smaller (i.e., |\u0394\u0394GSabin\u2212 (\u0394\u0394GD53N + \u0394\u0394GY73H + \u0394\u0394GK250E + \u0394\u0394GT362I)|~0.2\u20130.3 kcal/mol) than the kT value of 0.6 kcal/mol.",

Our previous MD simulations with the T362I variant had indicated that the nanosecond timescale dynamics near the region encompassing Asp53 are different from what was observed in the WT enzyme [22]. To gain more insight into potential allosteric effects between these amino acid substitutions, we characterized the double variant D53N/T362I. The sugar selectivity of the double variant was similar to that of the T362I variant, and the nucleobase selectivity was reduced slightly compared to the two single variants D53N and T362I (Table 1). To more rigorously compare the effects of the single-substituted variants to the double-substituted variant, we also determined the thermodynamic effects, as we had for the Sabin variant. The effects of the single amino acid substitutions were non-additive for AMP, 2\u2032-dAMP, and GMP incorporation (i.e., \u0394\u0394GD53N/T362I < \u0394\u0394GD53N + \u0394\u0394GT362I), which suggests negative cooperativity between the T362I and D53N substitutions (Figure 4a).

To gain more insight, we constructed thermodynamic cycles to gauge the contributions of the Y73H and K250E substitutions to the triple and Sabin variants respectively (Figure 4b\u2013d).

To better visualize these changes, we compared the kpol,correct/kpol,incorrect values between the T362I, D53N/T362I, D53N/Y73H/T362I, and Sabin variants (Figure 4e,f). It should be kept in mind that this series of variants does not necessarily recapitulate the order that these amino acid substitutions arose during the selection of the Sabin I virus. Nonetheless, this analysis provides some additional insight into a potential selection process in regards to the Sabin I polymerase, keeping in mind that other mutations in the Sabin I virus may have also played a role in regards to the polymerase changes (e.g., K250E is not stable in the Mahoney background). The results indicated that the Y73H substitution induced an increase in the relative rates of nucleotide misincorporation when comparing the D53N/T362I and D53N/Y73H/T362I variants. Interestingly, the Y73H effects appear to be opposed by the K250E substitution when comparing the D53N/Y73H/T362I and Sabin variants, such that the relative rate of the Sabin variant for misincorporation of nucleotide with incorrect nucleobase is very near that of WT RdRp, whereas the relative rate for misincorporation of nucleotide with incorrect sugar is near that of the T362I variant (Table 1, Figure 4).",

In the NMR experiments, we first add 3\u2032-dATP to s/sU RNA and enzyme, so that the nucleotide will become incorporated but lead to chain termination. Following passage through a de-salting column, another nucleotide is added to form a ternary complex between the enzyme, RNA, and the incoming nucleotide [29]. The correct nucleotide is considered to be UTP as it will basepair to A, which is the next templating base in the RNA. We have suggested that the peak position(s) of Met354 in motif D reports on whether motif D is in an open or closed conformation, which determines whether Lys359 is in a position to act as a general acid [29]. For WT enzyme, the ternary complexes bound with UTP and 2\u2019-dUTP yield different [methyl-13C] Met NMR spectra, providing fingerprints for the closed and open conformations, respectively (Figure 5a). We have also previously shown that Met354 in the T362I ternary complex bound with 2\u2032-dUTP gives rise to two resonances, consistent with this region of the enzyme fluctuating between the open and closed conformations on the slow NMR timescale (Figure 5b); the Met6 and Met74 peak also provide evidence of conformational exchange. We have suggested that T362I RdRp has reduced nucleotide discrimination because the motif-D loop can more readily access a closed conformation, even in the presence of an incorrect nucleotide [22].",

The Sabin I RdRp, in particular, had the lowest sugar discrimination among all variants tested (Table 1). To gain more insight into structural changes that might account for these functional behaviors, we collected [methyl-13C] Met NMR spectra for the triple variant D53N/Y73H/T362I and Sabin variant. The ternary complexes bound with UTP yielded [methyl-13C] Met spectra very similar to that of WT enzyme (Figure 5c,d). However, the triple variant D53N/Y73H/T362I and Sabin variant yielded small differences in the NMR spectrum for the ternary complex bound with 2\u2032-dUTP (Figure 5c,d). In these cases, Met6 gave rise to two (or more) peaks, suggesting conformational exchange around this residue. We note that the \u03b5-methyl group of Met6 packs against Phe59, which is located on the small \u03b1-helix that is N-capped by Asp53. Perhaps most informative is the difference between the Met354 peak(s) in the triple and Sabin variants compared to the T362I variant. There was no evidence for two Met354 resonances in the D53N/Y73H/T362I ternary complex bound with 2\u2032-dUTP, suggesting that the enzyme was not substantially populating the closed conformation. For the Sabin variant, there was a very low intensity peak at the chemical shift position we expect for Met354 in the closed conformation. These results suggest that the Sabin 2\u2019-dUTP ternary complex populates the closed conformation to a greater extent than the corresponding complexes for WT RdRp and the triple variant D53N/Y73H/T362I, but not nearly to the degree populated by the T362I variant.",

Intriguingly, comparisons of the second-order rate constants kpol/Kd,app indicated that Sabin RdRp more readily incorporated 2\u2032-C-methylAMP by a factor of two compared to WT RdRp.

It has been previously suggested that changes in the IRES are the major factor contributing to the attenuation of the virus [13,14]. Nonetheless, other mutations in the vaccine strains may also contribute to viral attenuation and efficacy of the vaccine [15,16,17,18,19,20,22]. We were especially interested in the RdRp amino acid changes encoded by the Sabin I strain. Our previous studies had shown that the T362I amino acid substitution induces a lower fidelity polymerase, and viruses encoding the T362I change showed a statistically significant decrease in viral pathogenesis [22]. We were thus interested in determining if there are similar functional changes in the Sabin I RdRp carrying all four amino acid changes (i.e., D53N/Y73H/K250E/T362I). To our surprise, the Sabin I RdRp discriminates against nucleotides with incorrect nucleobases to the same extent as WT enzyme (Table 1; Figure 3), suggesting that the other three amino acid changes (D53N, Y73H and K250E) also modify RdRp function.",

It should be kept in mind that the PV RdRp (also known as 3D) is found within other polyproteins, including 3CD, and changes in the 3D domain may have effects on the functions of these other proteins. In fact, 3CD is known to interact with the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) [46,47,48] and these interactions are important for regulating RNA synthesis and protein translation [48,49]. A change from a positively-charged residue (i.e., Lys) to a negatively-charged residue (i.e., Glu) at position 250 may disrupt interactions between 3CD and the 5\u2032UTR. The loss of the K250E change in the Mahoney background may suggest that other elements in the Sabin I virus are important for retaining this mutation, or from a different perspective, the K250E change may have been necessary to compensate for other mutations in the Sabin I strain during the selection process, such as those in the 5\u2032UTR.",

We had previously suggested that the lower fidelity of the T362I variant is likely because this substitution allows the motif-D active-site loop to fluctuate more readily into a \u201cclosed\u201d conformation even in the presence of incorrect nucleotide [22]. However, this reasoning likely does not fully explain the lower sugar selectivity of the Sabin I RdRp. The equilibrium population of the \u201cclosed\u201d state, according to the NMR experiments (Figure 5), is lower for the Sabin I RdRp compared to the T362I variant. It should be kept in mind, however, that these NMR experiments are under equilibrium conditions, and so the open-closed transition may still occur more rapidly in the Sabin I enzyme compared to WT RdRp, but not be reflected in the NMR spectra. Nonetheless, the NMR experiments suggest that the lower sugar fidelity of the Sabin I RdRp may owe to factors outside those of the motif-D active-site loop. The lower sugar selectivity of the Sabin I RdRp and RdRps associated with VAPP may serve as their Achilles heel. We have also shown that Sabin I RdRp more readily incorporated nucleotides with modified sugar groups (Table 1). These results suggest that Sabin I may be more sensitive to 2\u2019-modified nucleotide analogs, which have been used to treat Hepatitis C and related viruses [44,45]. Considering that all variants we tested have lower sugar fidelity than WT RdRp, VAPP may also be more sensitive to this class of compounds, potentially providing an additional treatment option.",
