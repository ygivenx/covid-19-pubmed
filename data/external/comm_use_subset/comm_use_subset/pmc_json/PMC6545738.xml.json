Traditional systems biology approaches to understanding cell dynamics during infection include the creation of detailed kinetic models for intercellular signaling pathways. While these models are advantageous in understanding the disease state in a quantitative way, they require experimentally-derived or estimated parameters and training data [2\u20134], without which complications can arise and an accurate model can quickly become unattainable. Further, modeling studies are often limited to specific pathways which fails to consider the total cellular environment as an interdependent system.",

This strategy provides a holistic understanding of system behavior by viewing proteins as interdependent states, regardless of specific interaction mechanisms, and allows for the exploration of cell level relationships. The field of network theory is well established. Several basic network metrics like degree (the number of interactions a protein is involved in) and betweenness (the importance of a protein to information flow through a network, or, how much of a bottleneck a protein is to system behavior) [6] are commonly used to describe the significance of network components in a wide range of applications [7\u20139]. These analyses have repeatedly revealed the importance of specific proteins within biological processes that cannot be found from traditional modeling approaches [10\u201314]. Disease networks have identified genes involved with cancer [15\u201318], demonstrated that the genes responsible for similar diseases are likely to interact with each other [19, 20], and predicted novel drug targets [21, 22].",

Past work studying the effects of influenza virus in PPI networks has focused on identifying host factors involved in virus replication and improving the prediction of drug targets but ends with an analysis of basic topological measurements. While this provides a general overview of the state of the network, it is a static snapshot of the cell and, therefore, fails to capture the dynamic nature of the cell. Therefore, the next logical step in analyzing biological networks lies in understanding how these dynamic systems can be manipulated and exploited to manage biological properties.",

Controllability classification is founded in \u201cdriver node\u201d calculations: identifying the network components which must be manipulated for the system to be fully controlled (analogous to determining the non-zero elements of the B matrix in classic controllability). Without manipulation, driver nodes will remain unaffected by changes to the rest of the system, rendering the total system uncontrollable. Driver nodes are identified using the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm [36] which can be applied to any directed graph in bipartite form. This method calculates the maximum matching of the graph, or, the largest set of network paths where no node is shared by two edges. Because each node can only influence one of its interactors, the identification of these paths dictates the way in which control can propagate through the network. The nodes that are not included in these paths or at the start of these paths are not receiving control from a neighboring node and, therefore, require \u201cdriving\u201d. A set of driver nodes (size ND) that is capable of controlling the total network is called a minimum input set (MIS). The MIS is not unique and the number of possible MISs scales exponentially with the size of the network [37]. After a primary MIS is calculated, two methods of controllability node classification can be used.",

            "text": "In robust controllability (by Liu et al. [38], pictured in Fig. 1b), the MIS is re-calculated (size ND\u2032) after removing each node from the network. The node is then classified by its effect on the manipulation required to control the network, where an increase in the size of the MIS makes it more difficult to control the network and a decrease in the size of the MIS makes it easier to control the network. The removal of: an indispensable node increases the number of driver nodes (ND\u2032 > ND), a dispensable node decreases the number of driver nodes (ND\u2032 < ND), and a neutral node has no effect on the number of driver nodes (ND\u2032 = ND). This method has previously been applied to many network types such as gene regulatory networks, food webs, citation networks, and PPI networks to better understand what drives the dynamics of each system [29, 38]. While it is useful to observe the structural changes to the network after the removal of singular nodes, this method only considers one possible MIS. A second global controllability method by Jia et al. [39] (Pictured in Fig. 1c) classifies a node by its role across all possible MISs. A critical node is included in all possible MISs, an intermittent node is included in some possible MISs, and a redundant node is not included in any possible MISs. This method places each node in the broader context of all possible control configurations.",

The betweenness shift between the two networks, particularly in IAV interacting proteins, supplies evidence that the topological effect of viral infection is wide reaching (Tables 1 and 4). Further, a comparison of driver protein betweenness for those that are also IAV interacting proteins in comparison to those that are not shows a significant difference. Driver proteins that are IAV interacting are not receiving control influence from viral proteins (dictated by the maximum matching requirement that each protein only control a single protein) and require additional external influence to achieve network control. However, the increased betweenness of proteins that are both driver and IAV interacting proteins suggests that this group is still of great importance to information flow through the network.

The increased population of indispensable IAV interacting proteins (robust controllability: ND\u2032 > ND, Fig. 3a) compared to what would be expected by random chance suggests that it would be more difficult for an outside influence (such as viral infection) to control the network after removing the IAV interacting proteins opposed to a randomly selected protein. This is logical as IAV interacting proteins act as the connection between viral proteins and the host network where control is initiated. The increased population of redundant IAV interacting proteins (global controllability: never a driver protein, Fig. 3f) when compared to the random expectation indicates that more IAV interacting proteins are always being manipulated internally than would be expected by chance. This means that they are fully incorporated into the control structure of the VIN. From these two results, one can conclude that IAV interacting proteins contribute to both the \u201cgate\u201d (the ease of entering the system) and the \u201cheart\u201d (the proteins responsible for propagating control through the system) of the network control structure during infection.

The large population of dispensable driver proteins (robust controllability: ND\u2032 < ND, Table 2) signifies that the majority of driver proteins are making it more difficult to control the network by requiring more external inputs to control system behavior. In their absence, the number of driver proteins would decrease and it would theoretically be easier for a viral attack to compromise the network control structure. As such, a possible strategy for drug development could be to protect these proteins from repression effects during infection. Over 75% of driver proteins are classified as intermittent (global controllability: sometimes a driver protein, Table 3), meaning there is at least one MIS where these driver proteins are not drivers, and receive control influence through internal propagation. This lends itself to the idea of viral escape routes: under pressure, virus proteins could utilize alternative pathways to maintain system control and reach the goal of hijacking cellular function.",

This could be a consequence of the interaction data used or it may be that the strategy applied here cannot distinguish between the behavior of healthy and diseased states. Knowing the extent of changes to cell behavior within immune response pathways [50\u201352], apoptosis signaling [53, 54], and transcriptional processes [55\u201357] during infection, the IAV infected cell can be interpreted as a different system. The failure to see this distinction may be a shortcoming of the robust controllability calculation, especially knowing that the 11 robust proteins are not unique due to the method\u2019s use of a single MIS. Overall, the robust analysis should be applied to additional virus-host networks in the fashion described within this study to further evaluate the method.",

All global proteins are IAV interacting and driver proteins, a high distinction which demonstrates a significant importance to network information flow marked by significantly higher betweenness in the VIN than even driver proteins that are not IAV interacting. Additionally, all global proteins have no importance to network flow in the HIN (betweenness = 0) (Table 4), suggesting their role in network structure \u201cturns on\u201d after the onset of infection. It is noteworthy that PRDX1 has been implicated in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [58], a lower respiratory tract infection that is often associated with influenza virus [59]. Though the number of global proteins identified in existing siRNA screening data is not statistically significant, it should be noted that siRNA screens cover only the partial genome. As such, this type of analysis could be used to direct future experimental studies to save time, money, and effort. IPA analysis reveals that some of the identified proteins hold roles in mRNA processing, an integral part of the influenza virus\u2019 ability to spread through processing its own RNA using host machinery [60]. The global protein network is centered around NF-kB, which is implicated in host immunity with evidence that the virus directly inhibits NF-kB activity [61, 62]. The interferon regulating roles of proteins in a high number of both identified sets (all 11 changing MIS proteins and 20 of 24 global-identified proteins) speak to their responsibility in controlling infection. PPA1 appears as downregulated in 63 studies and HNRNPA0 appears as downregulated in 20 studies when treated with interferon compared to a control, solidifying their involvement in the host immune response. In total, this evidence suggests that controllability analyses hold power as predictors for important regulators of the host response to influenza infection and, therefore, hold power for drug target prediction.",

While these methods (which include basic network metrics such as degree and betweenness of PPI networks) have been successful at identifying disease host factors and in drug target development in the existing body of work, this dual controllability study offers a novel, in-depth analysis of the role of individual proteins in the context of total system function and how possible changes to the system can be interpreted.",

            "text": "Lastly, though this study has used experimental data from Influenza A studies, this analysis can be used to improve the prediction of drug targets for any pathogen-host interaction given available protein interaction data because of the generality of the method. The limits of these methods lie in limited availability of large-scale, dependable databases of protein-protein interactions. Foundational maximum matching algorithms for the calculation of driver proteins must be performed with directed networks. While larger directed networks than the network from Vinayagam et al. [40] are available [70], the network used here contains only experimentally derived data opposed to computationally predicted interactions, assuring biological confidence in the results within this study. A robust controllability analysis of the computationally predicted network presented in Uhart et al. [70] finds that 29% of proteins are categorized as indispensable where approximately 20% of proteins in the Vinayagam network are classified as the same, though there is 89% overlap in directed edges between the two networks. This suggests that methods for predicting protein interactions may over represent these key proteins within the analysis, even in combination with experimental results. However, larger networks will move towards a more complete analysis of infected cell behavior and possibly reveal further proteins of interest. Therefore, the future of this field depends on continued establishment of large, confident, directed PPI networks.",

While robust controllability methods have previously been applied to study PPI networks [29], past analysis focuses only on the classification of virus interacting proteins and does not evaluate before and after the addition of virus-host interactions to the network. A global controllability analysis has never been applied to PPI networks. The unique construction of the VIN includes experimentally-derived virus-host interaction data [41] which represents opportunities for the virus to manipulate host intracellular machinery using protein-protein interactions. Here, analysis of the transition between the healthy and infected network states and further investigation of virus interacting and driver proteins has identified 24 proteins as regulatory markers of the infected state. This protein set is noted for its characteristics in topology, controllability, and functional roles within the infected cell: results that are summarized in Table 5. Our workflow observes both the effect of structural changes to the network in the case of potential protein knock outs, as well as each protein\u2019s role in all MISs, representing all possible ways of controlling the system. In combination, network approach and results provide deeper understanding of how changes to cell behavior at the onset of infection are able to occur through the work of a small set of viral proteins. Through understanding the system in this way, we present the possibility to \u201coutsmart\u201d viral attack by dismantling the control structure which allows the viral infection to take hold.",

After retrieving the network, a confidence level cutoff of 0.7 was used based on the correlation between confidence scores and biological relevance reported in Yu et al. [71]. This network is the HIN. Influenza A virus-host interactions detected by Co-IP RNAi assay in Watanabe et al. [41] were narrowed to interactions which contained host proteins already found within the HIN to avoid skewing degree and betweenness network metrics. All virus-host interactions are directed viral to host protein. These interactions were directly integrated into the host network, creating the VIN. All analysis was completed in R 3.4.3 using the igraph package.",
