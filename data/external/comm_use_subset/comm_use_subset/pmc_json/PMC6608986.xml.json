            "text": "The primary focus of stroke research has traditionally been on neuronal damage within gray matter, but emerging evidence reveals a robust correlation between white matter injury and long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after stroke [1]. White matter accounts for approximately 60% of total brain volume in humans. It is composed mostly of bundled axons and glial cells, including myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. Large axons in the brain are enwrapped by the insulating myelin sheath, which greatly accelerates neural transmission along nerve fibers. White matter damage after stroke involves multiple mechanisms, including demyelination, degeneration of axons, and neuroinflammation [2\u20134]. The vulnerability of oligodendrocytes to ischemic injury and the resultant demyelination have been reported in numerous publications using different stroke models [5\u20138]. Remyelination is a process whereby new myelin sheaths are generated around demyelinated axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) after injuries. It is one of the critical regenerative mechanisms for white matter repair after brain injuries. The differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes plays a central role in remyelination. OPCs are present in the normal adult brain [9]. Both the proliferation and migration of OPCs appear to increase in the adult ischemic brain [10], suggestive of endogenous efforts at remyelination and white matter repair. Cellular fate mapping studies have demonstrated the differentiation of OPCs toward the oligodendrocyte lineage in the ischemic brain, but the majority of these cells fail to develop into mature, functional oligodendrocytes [11\u201313]. As a result of this failure, white matter integrity after stroke shows little improvement over time [10]. Aside from these roadblocks, the efficacy of oligodendrocyte regeneration and axon remyelination also declines with age [14]. Without proper remyelination, naked axons are degraded, thereby interrupting neuronal communication and leading to functional disabilities. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to promote the differentiation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes and enhance the remyelination of axons are promising strategies to achieve successful white matter repair and functional recovery after stroke [11].",

            "text": "Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety of immune cells, but accumulating evidence indicates that IL-4 harbors functions beyond immune modulation in the CNS. For example, one early report suggested that IL-4 promoted learning and memory capacities in the normal brain [15]. This conclusion, however, was challenged by more recent studies demonstrating equivalent baseline cognitive functions between wild-type (WT) and IL-4 knockout (KO) genotypes [16, 17]. Instead, the IL-4 KO mice were shown to display anxiety-like behavior [17]. Despite these discrepancies in studies of IL-4 KO mice, the importance of IL-4 in maintaining or restoring neurological functions under pathological conditions is widely accepted. For example, the reduction of IL-4 levels with advanced age is thought to contribute to the cognitive decline in aged populations and in Alzheimer disease [18]. We previously documented increased expression of IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R\u03b1) in the ischemic brain [16]. IL-4 may be released from injured neurons and peripheral immune cells that have infiltrated the brain after stroke [19]. IL-4 deficiency exacerbates brain injury and neurological deficits in acute timeframes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [20], implicating IL-4 as an endogenous protective mechanism in the early stages after stroke. We also reported that IL-4 deficiency significantly impairs long-term sensorimotor and cognitive performance after ischemic injury, whereas IL-4 supplementation improves functional outcomes in two models of stroke [16]. Although IL-4 deficiency increased the loss of NeuN+ brain tissue at acute phases of stroke, it did not influence neuronal tissue loss at late stages [16]. These results suggest that the long-term beneficial role of IL-4 on neurological functions after stroke might be attributed to its protection of nonneuronal cells, such as white matter components. However, the potential effects of IL-4 on white matter integrity after ischemic stroke remain elusive.",

Intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after stroke robustly promoted oligodendrogenesis, enhanced white matter integrity, and improved long-term functional recovery. Complementary studies in cell cultures and animals revealed that IL-4-mediated oligodendrogenesis was achievable even in the absence of microglia/macrophages in vitro or after microglia/macrophage significant depletion in vivo. Furthermore, IL-4 directly promoted OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3)-dependent manner. These collective findings suggest that activation of the IL-4/PPAR\u03b3 signaling cascade may represent a novel recovery-enhancing strategy to promote long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke.",

Notably, IL-4R\u03b1 was also expressed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Fig 1A\u20131D). Different markers, including A2B5, O4, and O1/galactocerebroside (GalC), were used to identify oligodendrocytes at different differentiation stages. IL-4R\u03b1 was detected in CD45\u2212CD11b\u2212O4+ cells (Fig 1A\u20131D), which were identified as preoligodendrocytes and premyelinating oligodendrocytes, and CD45\u2212CD11b\u2212O1+ cells (Fig 1A and 1B), which were identified as premyelinating oligodendrocytes or mature oligodendrocytes [22]. The percentages of IL-4R\u03b1+O4+ cells were higher in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere (Fig 1C and 1D), suggesting a potential direct effect of IL-4 on white matter cells. ImageStream analyses confirmed that IL-4R\u03b1 was expressed on both A2B5+ OPCs and O4+ preoligodendrocytes/premyelinating oligodendrocytes, as well as CD11b+ microglia/macrophages in the ischemic hemisphere (Fig 1E and S1A\u2013S1C Fig).",

Dual staining for myelin basic protein (MBP, a major myelin protein) and SMI32 (a marker of demyelinated axons) was performed to assess the lesion in white matter (Fig 1F\u20131H). The overall immunofluorescence intensity of MBP staining decreased in the infarct border along three white matter\u2013rich brain regions (the external capsule [EC], the cortex, and the striatum) (see \u201ctotal\u201d values in panel of the right of Fig 1F) at 14 d after MCAO, indicating a significant loss of myelin protein after stroke. Additionally, the overall immunofluorescence of SMI32 increased in these three regions, resulting in a significant increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio in WT mice after stroke (Fig 1G). IL-4-deficient mice displayed exacerbation of the loss in MBP (Fig 1F) and a further increase in the SMI32/MBP ratio compared to WT mice (Fig 1G), suggesting that IL-4 is important in maintaining axonal myelination or promoting axonal remyelination after stroke.",

In order to confirm the effect of IL-4 in white matter, we explored the remyelination capacity of IL-4 in a model of lysophosphatidylcholine/lysolecithin (LPC)-mediated demyelination using ex vivo organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. This toxicant-based experimental model of demyelination, although not attempting to fully mimic a disease with complex etiology and pathogenesis, has proven extremely useful for understanding the biology of remyelination [23]. Slices collected from WT and IL-4 KO mice exhibited comparable extents of demyelination, as revealed by the loss of MBP staining along neurofilament-heavy (NFH+) axonal fibers, at 3 d after LPC (Fig 2A). Partial remyelination was achieved by 7 d following LPC in WT brain slices, but IL-4 deficiency significantly delayed remyelination (Fig 2A and 2B), as shown by lower MBP staining intensity (Fig 2C) and less MBP+ axonal coverage (Fig 2D). IL-4 supplementation significantly enhanced remyelination in WT brain slices and rescued remyelination capacities in IL-4 KO brain slices (Fig 2A, 2C and 2D).",

Frequency histograms revealed much greater reduction of axon diameters in the MCAO + vehicle group compared to the MCAO + IL-4 and sham groups, suggesting higher axonal degeneration in stroke mice without IL-4 treatment (Fig 5B). Scatter plots of the g-ratio (the ratio of the inner axonal diameter to the total outer diameter of myelinated fiber) as a function of axon diameter in sham mice or stroke mice treated with vehicle or IL-4 revealed significant differences in myelin thickness (average g-ratio: sham = 0.72 [n = 183 axons from 3 animals]; MCAO + vehicle = 0.79 [n = 233 axons from 3 animals]; MCAO + IL-4 = 0.73 [n = 176 axons from 3 animals]) (Fig 5C). Significant increases in the g-ratio were observed in both low- and high-caliber axons at 35 d after MCAO, indicating a reduction in myelin thickness (Fig 5D). IL-4 post-treatment significantly reduced the g-ratio of the middle-sized (diameter = 400\u2013800 nm) and large (diameter > 800 nm) axonal fibers, suggesting that IL-4 may maintain axonal myelination or promote axonal remyelination after stroke. The g-ratio in small axonal fibers (diameter < 400 nm) displayed a trend toward reduction with IL-4 treatment (Fig 5D).",

The total numbers of normal NOR decreased significantly after stroke in the ipsilateral EC compared to the contralateral EC (Fig 5F), and this was accompanied by a decrease in the Caspr+ paranode length (Fig 5G).

Long-term sensorimotor performance in the rotarod test after MCAO was also improved in IL-4-treated mice (Fig 6C). Furthermore, IL-4-treated mice exhibited long-term improvements in cognitive function in the Morris water maze test, as manifested by a reduction in the latency to find the hidden platform (improved spatial learning, Fig 6D and 6E) and increased time spent in the target quadrant when the platform was removed (improved memory, Fig 6D and 6F).

We observed in our model that IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype (CD206+Iba1+) at 7 and 14 d after stroke (S4 Fig). Microglia depletion through genetic targeting or pharmacological treatment is a widely used approach to evaluate the contribution of this population to various biological processes [29]. Therefore, we chose PLX5622, an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, to deplete microglia/macrophages and identify their role in IL-4-afforded oligodendrogenesis (Fig 7E) [30]. Consistent with previous reports [30], PLX5622 achieved approximately 90% depletion efficacy within a short period. Dietary intake of PLX5622 for 7 d dramatically reduced the number of microglia in the normal brain (S5A Fig). Continuation on the PLX5622 diet maintained low numbers of microglia/macrophages in the brain 21 d after sham or MCAO surgery (28 d after initiation of PLX5622 diet) (S5A\u2013S5C and S5E Fig). The number of neurons remained statistically similar in microglia/macrophage-depleted mice and microglia/macrophage-competent mice (S5A, S5B, S5D and S5F Fig). The PLX5622 diet also selectively reduced the number of CD3\u2212CD19\u2212Gr1\u2212CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages in the blood (S5G and S5H Fig). Significant depletion of microglia/macrophages did not change the number of BrdU+APC+ cells or total BrdU+ cells compared to microglia/macrophage-competent stroke mice (Fig 7F\u20137H). IL-4 treatment increased the numbers of BrdU+APC+ cells or total BrdU+ cells after stroke in mice fed with the control diet. IL-4 treatment exhibited a trend (p = 0.086) toward lower capacities to increase the number of BrdU+APC+ newly generated oligodendrocytes in microglia-depleted mice versus microglia-competent mice, supporting a potential role of microglia in IL-4-afforded oligodendrogenesis. Importantly, IL-4 treatment still resulted in a significant enhancement of BrdU+APC+ oligodendrocyte regeneration in microglia/macrophage-depleted stroke mice (Fig 7F and 7G). Considering the expression of IL-4R on oligodendrocyte linage cells, these results indicate that IL-4 may exert microglia/macrophage-independent effects on oligodendrocyte regeneration after demyelination.",

OPCs were treated with PBS or IL-4 (20 ng/mL) for 3 d. Total RNA extraction from cell pellets was used for the Affymetrix Clariom S rat array. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clustering of samples in a treatment-dependent manner (Fig 8D). In total, 996 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; and fold change > 2), out of which 495 were up-regulated and 501 were down-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs relative to PBS-treated OPCs (Fig 8E, S1 and S2 Tables). The gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was then performed using the Metascape analysis [32] (http://metascape.org). The top 20 enriched GO terms in three categories (biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions) were identified in the up-regulated DEGs by IL-4 treatment (S8A Fig). A network plot further captured the relationships between the main regulated biological processes, which were related to cell adhesion and motility, cytokine production, cell responses to external stimuli, cellular component organization, and cell death (Fig 8F). The enriched GO terms among the down-regulated DEGs in IL-4-treated OPCs represent biological processes such as developmental growth, small molecule biosynthetic process, vessel development, and responses to nutrients and peptides (S8B Fig). These results indicated changes in cell mobilization, growth, differentiation, and defense in IL-4-treated OPCs. A Kyoto encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified eight enriched pathways for up-regulated DEGs, of which the PPAR signaling pathway was dramatically up-regulated in IL-4-treated OPCs compared to vehicle-treated cells (Fig 8G). The PPAR transcription factor assay confirmed that PPAR\u03b3 activity, but not PPAR\u03b1 or PPAR\u03b4 activities, was up-regulated in OPCs upon IL-4 treatment (Fig 8H); these effects were abolished when IL-4R\u03b1 was blocked with a neutralizing antibody (Fig 8I). Furthermore, immunostaining (Fig 8J and 8K) and western blotting (Fig 8L\u20138N, and S9 Fig) demonstrated that the PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor GW9662 blocked IL-4-induced expression of mature oligodendrocyte markers (MBP or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG]), suggesting that PPAR\u03b3 activation is essential for the OPC differentiation induced by IL-4.",

To confirm the KO of PPAR\u03b3 specifically in OPCs, PDGFR\u03b1+CD45\u2212 OPCs, GLAST+CD45\u2212 astrocytes, CD45+ immune cells, and other CD45\u2212GLAST\u2212PDGFR\u03b1\u2212 CNS cells were sorted from the brains collected from PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice at 9 d after 4-hydroxytamoxifen injections. The DNA extracts were subjected to PCR using primers flanking the loxp site and primers detecting the Cre cDNA. The loxp band was abolished in OPCs because of the targeted deletion after Cre-induced recombination, while remaining intact in astrocytes, immune cells, and other CNS cells sorted from the same brain (Fig 9B). The expression of Cre was detected in the OPCs of the PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice (Fig 9B). Deletion of PPAR\u03b3 specifically in OPCs exerted no impact on IL-4R expression on O4+ oligodendrocytes (S10 Fig). Vehicle or IL-4 treatment in PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice resulted in similar neuronal tissue loss (Fig 9C and 9D) and white matter lesion (Fig 9C, 9E and 9F) 35 d after stroke. The lack of PPAR\u03b3 expression in OPCs did not significantly impair oligodendrocyte replacement after stroke, as shown by comparable numbers of BrdU+APC+ cells in the ischemic brain from PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice and control mice at 35 d after MCAO (Fig 9G and 9H). However, the absence of PPAR\u03b3 in OPCs reduced the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated BrdU+APC+ oligodendrocytes (Fig 9G and 9H). Consistent with a reduced capacity to promote oligodendrogenesis, IL-4 failed to improve long-term sensorimotor (Fig 9I and 9J) or cognitive (Fig 9K\u20139M) deficits after stroke in the absence of PPAR\u03b3.",

For example, IL-4 expression increases transiently at early time points in the ischemic brain, which is attributed, at least partly, to its release from injured neurons or from infiltrated immune cells [19]. Cerebral IL-4 levels then return to baseline within 1 wk after stroke [16, 19]. In patients, serum levels of IL-4 are known to change following an acute stroke [33]. Furthermore, IL-4 gene polymorphisms are related to susceptibility to ischemic stroke and subsequent functional outcomes [34, 35]. Finally, a recent study reported the expression of IL-4R surrounding axonal filaments in postmortem brain tissue from patients with multiple sclerosis [31]. Although these clinical and experimental data are correlative, the present series of in vivo and in vitro studies firmly establish a causal link between IL-4 repletion and white matter integrity in preclinical stroke models. Deficiency of endogenous IL-4 exacerbated white matter disruption, whereas intranasal IL-4 treatment\u2014even when delayed until 6 h post-stroke\u2014improved the structural and functional integrity of white matter.",

            "text": "An improvement in white matter integrity might be achieved in two ways: preservation of preexisting white matter structures or enhancement of white matter repair. Our data favor the latter as the predominant mechanism of action for IL-4. First, longitudinal DTI revealed similar reductions in FA values shortly after stroke in vehicle or IL-4-treated mice, indicating comparable degrees of initial white matter injury during the early/acute phase. A significant improvement in white matter microstructure was only observed in IL-4-treated animals in later stages of recovery (28 and 35 d after stroke). These results strongly suggest a delayed effect of IL-4 on white matter repair, rather than preservation shortly after injury. Second, electron microscopy (EM) and histological studies revealed structural signs of remyelination in the ischemic brain, including thinner myelin segments than before stroke, and reduced paranode length with Caspr/Nav1.6 staining [36]. Each of these structural alterations were significantly improved by IL-4 treatment, indicating superior remyelination. Third, IL-4 treatment increased the number of new, mature oligodendrocytes (APC+BrdU+) in the ischemic brain 35 d after stroke. Such improvements in oligodendrogenesis are critical for successful remyelination. Finally, the LPC model of demyelination\u2013remyelination unequivocally confirmed the white matter\u2013specific effects of IL-4 in remyelination. As expected, the IL-4-mediated reconstitution of myelin structure culminated in functional improvements in neural conduction and behavioral performance, despite no changes in the degree of gray matter loss. Although IL-4 is important for white matter repair after brain injury, the IL-4 KO mice do not display deficits in myelin coverage in organotypic brain slice cultures under physiological conditions. This observation is consistent with the view that different mechanisms control myelin sheath formation during normal development and remyelination [36].",

As the IL-4 treatment was initiated 6 h after stroke, it remains possible that IL-4 may provide some degree of early protection [16]. It is also possible that some NeuN+ neurons remaining within the gray matter of mice without IL-4 might not be physiologically functional, although they are still histologically present, perhaps because their communication via white matter tracts is significantly impeded.",

            "text": "A previous study using mixed glial cultures demonstrated that the addition of IL-4 promotes the differentiation of OPCs into MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes in vitro, an effect mainly attributed to IL-4-mediated anti-inflammatory effects [37]. An additional conclusion emerging from our studies is that IL-4 enhances white matter repair at least partially independent of its well-established anti-inflammatory effects on microglia/macrophages. In IL-4-treated stroke mice, we observed an anti-inflammatory phenotypic change in microglia/macrophages, which is known to promote remyelination after CNS injury [28]. However, dramatic depletion of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain did not abolish the capacity of IL-4 to enhance oligodendrocyte replacement, supporting the involvement of microglia/macrophage-independent mechanisms. In vitro studies then confirmed that IL-4 can also directly target white matter components and promotes OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes in the absence of microglia/macrophages. Previous fate mapping studies revealed that OPCs are responsible for generating new oligodendrocytes during remyelination [38, 39]. However, the differentiation of OPCs is frequently impaired in lesioned brains, mainly because of nonpermissive environmental cues [40\u201342]. We found that IL-4 treatment may overcome these obstacles for OPC differentiation in the ischemic brain, both directly by promoting OPC differentiation and indirectly through immunomodulation. Notably, endogenous oligodendrocyte differentiation has been observed until as late as 3 mo after CNS injuries [39], and this prolonged effort may provide a sufficiently wide therapeutic window that allows delayed IL-4 treatment to restore white matter and encourage long-term stroke recovery.",

PPAR\u03b3 is a master transcription factor known to promote OPC differentiation and maturation though manifold mechanisms involving enhanced myelin lipid synthesis, reduced oxidative stress, and promotion of mitochondrial function [43, 44]. Our previous work has shown that rosiglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist, enhanced OPC proliferation and increased the number of newly generated mature oligodendrocytes after MCAO [45]. In addition, PPAR\u03b3 may interact with histone deacetylases to modulate cell differentiation [46]. We demonstrated here that PPAR\u03b3 inhibition abolished the effect of IL-4 on OPC differentiation in vitro and that OPC-specific KO of PPAR\u03b3 in vivo reduced IL-4-enhanced oligodendrocyte replacement in the ischemic brain. These collective results indicate that IL-4-induced oligodendrocyte differentiation/maturation relies at least partially on the activation of PPAR\u03b3 activity in OPCs. Precisely how IL-4/IL-4R engages PPAR\u03b3 activity is not yet known, but several studies suggest that IL-4 may activate PPAR\u03b3 in macrophages and other cell types through signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling [37, 47]. Whether this pathway is also operational in OPCs lies beyond the scope of the present study but warrants further investigation.",

Several lines of evidence from our study support the capacity of IL-4 to target multiple types of cells in addition to oligodendrocytes. First, we did not observe significant differences in the density of BrdU+APC+ cells between WT and PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice following MCAO, suggesting that endogenous IL-4 is able to promote white matter integrity by targeting other types of cells. Second, although PPAR\u03b3 inhibition eliminated the effect of IL-4 on OPC differentiation in cultures, the absence of PPAR\u03b3 in OPCs reduced, but did not abolish, the capacity of IL-4 to increase the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes in vivo. These results suggest that PPAR\u03b3 expression in OPCs is an important but not exclusive mechanism for IL-4-induced oligodendrogenesis in preclinical stroke. Indeed, we observed that IL-4 treatment robustly promoted microglia/macrophage polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2phenotype, as mentioned above. IL-4-stimulated microglia have been shown to release IL-4 induced 1 (IL4I1), which in turn augments remyelination [48]. Thus, direct and indirect effects on microglia/macrophages may contribute to the white matter repair afforded by IL-4. It has also been reported that the effects of IL-4 on adaptive immune responses contribute partially to recovery from neurotrauma [49]. In our hands, however, repeated intranasal IL-4 administration did not change T-lymphocyte subpopulations or B lymphocytes in blood and did not alter the composition of infiltrated lymphocytes. These data dispute the involvement of adaptive immune responses in IL-4-afforded neuroprotection in our stroke model.",

For example, a recent study reported that the activation of IL-4R signaling in neurons may increase axonal outgrowth and ameliorate axonal pathology in a model of multiple sclerosis [31]. In this context, it is important to note that we did not observe improvements in the DTI measurement for axonal integrity (AD, \u03bb||). In other disease models, multiple factors including inflammation, cellular infiltration, and gliosis may contribute to AD at chronic stages of disease. Therefore, the measurement of \u03bb|| appears to lack sufficient resolution to distinguish axonal damage/repair versus confounding cellular responses over the course of progressive demyelination [50]. On the other hand, our EM data demonstrated an increase in axon diameter in IL-4-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated controls, supporting a beneficial role of IL-4 in maintaining axonal structure. These structural data were supported by our electrophysiological studies of axon conductance. Preservation of axonal structure and electrical function might provide an important feedback signal for OPC differentiation and guide remyelination [51, 52], preventing Wallerian degeneration of neurons after ischemia and enhancing white matter repair. In addition to these mechanisms, astrocytes are known to produce trophic factors in response to IL-4 stimulation, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), both of which are also critical for brain function and brain repair [53].",

In the present study, IL-4 stimulated OPC differentiation in cultures at a concentration range of 5\u2013100 ng/mL, and the optimal concentration was 10\u201320 ng/mL. Although there is neither a mathematical nor empirical method to accurately convert in vitro concentrations to in vivo intranasal dosage, these in vitro data support the capacity of IL-4 to directly target OPCs at low concentrations. Previous preclinical studies have similarly documented therapeutic effects of low doses of IL-4 in ischemic stroke and other neurological diseases. For example, subcutaneous IL-4 application at 2 \u03bcg/kg/d [19] or intracerebroventricular application of IL-4 at 60 ng/d [16] significantly improved long-term outcomes after stroke. Vogelaar and colleagues reported that intrathecal or intranasal (1 \u03bcg/d) IL-4 treatment ameliorated clinical signs and reversed disease progression in a model of multiple sclerosis [31]. Those studies, however, did not measure IL-4 concentrations in the brain after treatment. Here, we delivered IL-4 intranasally at a dose of 50 \u03bcg/kg/d (about 1.25 \u03bcg/d based on 0.025 kg average body weight), which significantly elevated IL-4 levels in key parts of the brain. This dose is similar to the effective intranasal dose for Vogelaar\u2019s study and improved long-term functional recovery in our stroke model. Repeated dosing regimens or controlled continuous release was employed for all in vivo IL-4 treatment because of its rapid clearance and inactivation. The use of liposome-entrapped peptides has been reported to protect the cytokine and enhance its tissue delivery [55, 56]. Consistent with those findings, we demonstrated that IL-4 liposome nanoparticle delivery elevated IL-4 levels in the brain for at least 24 h. Further characterization of the optimal regimen of IL-4 treatment for stroke would accelerate its clinical translation.",

            "text": "Despite growing awareness of the importance of white matter restoration in poststroke rehabilitation, there is no effective therapy to preserve white matter function or to improve its repair in humans. Our study has uncovered a novel role of IL-4 in poststroke white matter recovery\u2014a role that lies beyond its well-known immunoregulatory functions. Furthermore, we have shown that IL-4 promotes oligodendrogenesis and white matter repair in a PPAR\u03b3-dependent manner. Therefore, it seems reasonable to continue to test IL-4 as a therapeutic strategy for functional recovery after ischemic stroke. In particular, the intranasal route enables CNS IL-4 delivery, which is expected to significantly reduce the risk of peripheral side effects and expedite the eventual translation of IL-4 treatment for stroke victims.",

Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5% N2O mixture until they were unresponsive in the tail-pinch test. Mice were then fitted with a nose cone blowing 1.5% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5% N2O mixture under spontaneous breathing for anesthesia maintenance. An 8\u20130 monofilament with a silicon-coated tip was introduced into the common carotid artery, advanced to the origin of the MCA, and left in place to limit MCA blood flow for 60 min. Rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C using a temperature-regulated heating pad during surgery. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured in all stroke animals using laser Doppler flowmetry. Animals that did not display at least 70% reduction in regional cerebral blood flow during MCAO compared to pre-ischemia levels were excluded from further experimentation. Surgeries and quantification were performed by investigators blinded to animal genotypes and experimental grouping. Animals were randomly assigned to sham or cerebral ischemia groups and received randomized treatments using a lottery drawing box. A grand total of 287 mice (64 sham-operated and 223 ischemic mice) were used in this study, including 26 mice that were excluded from further assessments, either because of death after ischemia or failure of ischemia induction. The mortality during MCAO surgery was 7.6% in WT male mice (12/158), 14.3% in IL-4 KO male mice (1/7), 11.1% in microglia/macrophage-depleted mice (3/27), and 12.5% in PPAR\u03b3-OPC KO mice (3/24).

To remove unbound sample, arrays were first washed with nonstringent wash buffer A. The GeneChips were then stained for 10 min in stain cocktail 1. Buffer A was again used to wash off excess stain. Signal amplification was achieved by 10-min incubation with stain cocktail 2 followed by a second 10-min incubation with stain cocktail 1. The chip was washed with high-stringency buffer B and filled with Array Holding Buffer before being removed from the fluidics station and scanned using the GeneArray 3000 scanner.
