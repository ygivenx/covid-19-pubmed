For example, in ovo treatment of CpG DNA significantly induced the recruitment of macrophages in chicken lungs [13]. This induction was associated with the inhibition of avian influenza virus replication in a NO dependent way. Similarly, in another study, the enhanced NO production in macrophages following treatment of the TLR4 ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), led to an antiviral response against infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) [14]. Furthermore, in ovo treatment of TLR2 ligand, lipotechoic acid (LTA), reduced ILTV infection in chickens which correlated with a significant upregulation of mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS [15].",

In chickens, ssRNA can induce antibacterial effects against Salmonella Enteritidis [17] and antiviral effects against very virulent infectious bursal disease virus infection [18], similarly in mice, pre-treatment with resiquimod cleared bacteria involved in sepsis [19]. Recently, a study demonstrated that synthetic ssRNA upregulates mRNA of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS in chicken in vivo [20]. However, the antiviral response of TLR7 activation against ILTV infection in chicken is not known. Therefore, our objectives for this study were to determine 1) whether in ovo treated synthetic ssRNA, resiquimod is capable of eliciting macrophage responses post-hatch, 2) whether activation of the TLR7 pathway stimulates antiviral activity against ILTV and 3) the antiviral mechanisms involved following activation of TLR7 pathway in chicken.",

In the current study, we discovered that in ovo treatment of TLR7 ligand, synthetic ssRNA, increased recruitment of macrophages in respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Macrophages are key immune cells involved in initiating innate antiviral response by several mechanisms. First, avian macrophages are capable of producing highly reactive antiviral molecules such as NO [36] and previously it has been reported NO mediated antiviral activity against number of avian viruses such as ILTV, reovirus and Marek\u2019s disease virus [14, 35, 37]. Second, avian macrophages can produce a number of cytokines such as type 1 IFNs and IL-1\u03b2 [38, 39]. These cytokines can elicit antiviral responses. For example, type I IFNs are effective in reducing avian viruses such as birna virus, corona virus, herpes viruses and paramyxovirus [40\u201344]. Third, macrophages play a role as phagocytic cells reducing virus burden in the host [45]. Fourth, as an antigen presenting cell, the macrophages play a vital role in activating the adaptive arm of the immune system by presenting antigens to helper T lymphocytes [46]. In the current study, we observed that avian macrophages are capable of producing NO and IL-1\u03b2 following stimulation with resiquimod although further studies are required to elucidate whether resiquimod is involved in enhancing phagocytosis and antigen presentation increasing adaptive immune response against ILTV infection.",

            "text": "It has been reported previously that many TLR ligands were able to induce protective host responses against ILTV, such as CpG DNA, LPS and LTA [9, 14, 15, 30]. Although different types of TLR ligands were found to be effective against many viral infections, there is a paucity of literature on the antiviral effect of TLR7 ligand against avian viral infections. Previously, Annamalai et al reported that the TLR7 agonist, R848, induced protective antiviral response against infectious bursal disease virus infection in 3 weeks old chicken, associated with the upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, iNOS and IFN\u03b3 [18]. Similarly, Stewart et al demonstrated that the other TLR7 ligands, Poly-C and ioxoribine, inhibited low pathogenic H1N1 avian influenza virus replication in chickens and the antiviral response of ioxoribine was associated with the increased gene expression for IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb from primary chicken splenocytes [47]. Our study was directed to demonstrate whether TLR7 ligand, resiquimod was able to elicit antiviral responses against ILTV infection when resiquimod treatment is done in ovo. In agreement with previous studies using other TLR ligands against ILTV infection [9, 14, 15, 30], we found that in ovo treated resiquimod is capable of eliciting antiviral response against ILTV infection in terms of reducing cloacal virus shedding at 7 dpi. Although we observed that resiquimod was effective when treated in ovo reducing ILTV shedding via cloacal route at 7 dpi, we did not observe a significant reduction in ILTV shedding at 4 dpi and via oropharyngeal route at 4 or 7 dpi. Previously, it has been reported in similar experiment setting that CpG DNA injected in ovo reduces ILTV cloacal shedding at 4 dpi but not the oropharyngeal shedding [48]. It is difficult to explain this discrepancy of ILTV shedding between cloacal and oropharyngeal routes. However, it may be potentially related to the differences in virus replication pattern between 4 dpi and 7 dpi, a differences in the antiviral mechanism induced from a different TLR ligand used [48] and the differences in the immune response between gastrointestinal and respiratory systems [49] such as intestinal immune tolerance [50] and presence of antiviral surfactant proteins in the lungs [51]. Furthermore, we did not observed severe clinical manifestations following ILTV (strain N-71851) infection in this experiment as has been seen previously by our group [30, 48]. The lack of clinical manifestation except transient non-specific signs such as huddling together and droopy and ruffled feathers may be due to differences in the batch of the virus and slight reduction in ILTV titer during storage at \u2212 80 \u00b0C.",

Although resiquimod was capable of inducing NO production in vitro, interestingly, we did not find the resiquimod-mediated induction of NO in vivo. Furthermore, the resiquimod-mediated NO production is not eliciting antiviral response against ILTV. However, previously it has been shown that NO originated from LPS/ CpG DNA-mediated induction of avian macrophages is inhibitory against ILTV and low pathogenic avian influenza virus infections [13, 14]. Although, this discrepancy in antiviral response mediated by NO originated from various TLR pathways is difficult to explain, it is possible that the difference may be connected to the amount of NO production downstream of these TLR pathways. In the current study, the amount of NO produced following resiquimod induced macrophages was minimal (< 10 \u03bcM) compared to other TLR ligands we tested previously in similar experimental setting such as LPS (> 50 \u03bcM) [14] and CpG DNA (> 30 \u03bcM) [13]. Overall, our current and previous findings suggest that antiviral response mediated by NO is dependent on the concentration of NO. However, one of the limitation in this study is that we did not find the exact level of NO that can decrease the viral replication and that 1400 W can inhibit this antiviral effect by including other TLR ligands such as LPS and CpG DNA at different concentrations.",

Our current data show that macrophages produce IL-1\u03b2 in response to TLR7 ligand, resiquimod in vitro and in vivo in lungs. Direct and indirect IL-1\u03b2 mediated antiviral responses have been observed in other host-virus infection models. Furthermore, it has been reported that IL-1\u03b2 inhibits the replication of West Nile virus [58], hepatitis B virus [59], cytomegalovirus [60] and respiratory syncytial virus [61]. However, our current data show that the antiviral response against ILTV infection is not dependent on IL-1\u03b2 originated from avian macrophages in response to resiquimod. Whether this lack of antiviral responses against ILTV attributable to IL-1\u03b2 is due to the amount of IL-1\u03b2 produced following resiquimod treatment requires further investigation. This fact would have been clarified in our in vitro experiment if we had included recombinant IL-1\u03b2 as a positive control. Although, our finding of resiquimod-induced antiviral response against ILTV is not dependent on individual innate immune mediators, it may be potentially due to the combined effect of NO and IL-1\u03b2 or other antiviral cytokines not tested in this study such as IFN\u03b3 [62].",

The main implication of this observation is that this induction of immune response via in ovo administration is desirable in the field situations in order to provide early innate immune response at the time of placing the day-old chickens in the barn against circulating environmental pathogens. Although we studied the mechanistic aspects of in ovo resiquimod treatment against only ILTV infection, our finding of the mechanisms of induction of innate immunity following in ovo treatment of resiquimod may be applicable against other respiratory viruses as well due to the non-specific nature of innate host responses which requires further investigation.",

ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s posttest for selected comparison was performed to identify the differences between groups and the differences were considered significant at P < 0.05",

SPF eggs were treated in ovo with resiquimod (n = 5) or PBS (n = 4) at ED18 and the eggs were incubated until hatch. At day 1 post-hatch, lungs were preserved in OCT, sectioned and double immunofluorescent assay was performed to identify the macrophages that produce IL-1\u03b2. The quantitative data from lung is shown along with representative immunoassayed images. Student\u2019s t-test was performed to identify group differences and the differences were considered significant at P < 0.05",
