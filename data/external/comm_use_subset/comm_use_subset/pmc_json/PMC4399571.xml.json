It has been estimated that [2] one-third of the world\u2019s population is infected with tubercle bacilli whilst only 10% of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis become TB patients, indicating remarkable individual differences which may be related to nutrition, constitution [3], specific and non-specific resistance [4,5] and genetic susceptibility [6,7].",

The reduction of MBL multimer results in the impaired binding with ligand and the increased likelihood of being degraded by metalloproteinase [12-14]. MASP-2 gene mutation also facilitates the changes in the serum concentration of the proteins it encodes (namely, MASP2 and Map19), and results in the impaired binding with MBL and ficolin molecules, consequently blocking activation of the lectin-complement pathway resulting in impaired functioning of the non-specific body immune system [15,16].",

            "text": "The impact of MBL gene polymorphism on susceptibility to TB has been reported in different regions and among different races [17-19], though the findings are inconsistent between studies. Liu W and colleagues conducted analysis of the six polymorphic sites (A/B, A/C, A/D, H/L, Y/X and P/Q) of MBL genes in the Chinese Han population (including 152 male TB patients and 293 healthy males as controls), and found that only the site H/L was associated with susceptibility to TB [20]. Contrary to this, SHI J and colleagues reported that A/B was associated with susceptibility to TB in the Han population, whilst P/Q was not [21]. Further to these inconsistencies, Soborg and Selvaraj reported that low serum MBL levels could reduce tubercle bacilli infections [18,19], whilst other studies found that high of serum MBL levels [22,23] could reduce tubercle bacilli infections. Although studies have shown that Promoter -221(Y/X) mutation (YX, XX) [22] and HYB haplotype [23] could lead to decreased serum MBL [12,24] and enhanced susceptibility to TB. Liu Wei and colleagues reported that [20] the promoter -221(Y/X) mutation in the Han population was not associated with susceptibility to TB. No statistically significant difference was observed possibly due to the small sample size, and therefore the need for large sample sizes to explore the association between Y/X (rs7096206) and the susceptibility to TB in the Han population. The polymorphism of MASP-2 genes was also found to be associated with serum protein levels [15,25,26] and susceptibility to multiple diseases [27-29]. If rs2273346 (p.V377A) mutation (TC, CC) can lead to decreased serum MASP-2 concentration, is the mutation associated with susceptibility to TB? The site of rs6695096 is located at intron 7 and it is not clear that the polymorphism of this locus is associated with the susceptibility to TB. This case-control study explores the polymorphism of the rs7096206 of MBL and the rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP2 genes in the Han population in Hunan Province, China, as well as their gene-gene interactions, in order to determine their impact on the susceptibility to TB.",

Some other studies indicated that higher serum MBL levels can reduce tubercle bacilli infections, while higher serum MBL levels are associated with wild-type MBL genes [22,33]. Meta-analysis [34] by Denholm and colleagues indicates that polymorphism of MBL genes may be associated with serum MBL level rather than susceptibility to TB. These studies ignored the interactions between genes, as well as certain genetic and environmental factors in the analysis of gene and susceptibility to TB. Moreover, small sample sizes cannot detect real association between MBL genes and TB. Our study included some possible covariates in the logistic regression model for analyzing the relationships between MBL genes and TB, such as sex, age, marital status, educational background, BMI, smoking status, alcohol drinking, tea drinking, BCG vaccination and exposure to kitchen fumes, excluding possible confounding caused by these factors.

Our study reports on the association between MASP-2 gene polymorphism and TB susceptibility. The study has shown that that rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes can increase susceptibility to TB, possibly because the mutation of rs2273346 (p.V377A) (TC, CC) and rs6695096 (TC, CC) can lead to decreased serum MASP-2 concentration and possibly decreased activity of MASP-2, and subsequently impairing the body immune function and increasing the risk of TB. The site of rs6695096 is located at intron7, the mutation of which may affect gene regulation and selective splicing regulation although it will not affect the sequence of amino acids [36,37] and subsequently affect serum concentration and activity of MASP-2.

There were significant positive interactions between rs7096206 of MBL and both rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2, which suggest that the mutations of both MBL genes and MASP-2 genes can lead to an increased risk of TB. These findings provide important reference information for studies on MBL and MASP-2 interaction mechanism.",

First, there are six known polymorphisms within MBL-2 that affect the amounts of MBL in human plasma, but we only detected the polymorphism of rs7096206. We could therefore not analyze the impact of other polymorphisms and haplotypes of MBL gene on TB susceptibility. Secondly, we did not test for the association between rs6695096 and MASP-2, and did not find any laboratory evidence in literature to support such association. Thirdly, cases and controls in our study were sampled from different regions. However, all the participants have been limited to Han Chinese, and all the possible impacts of non-genetic factors such as sex, age, marital status, educational background, BMI, smoking status, alcohol drinking, tea drinking, and so on, were adjusted. So the results observed in our study should be reliable.",
