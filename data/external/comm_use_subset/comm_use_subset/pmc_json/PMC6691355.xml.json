Typical clinical symptoms of PRRS are mild to severe respiratory disease in infected newborn and growing pigs, and reproductive failure in pregnant sows. Two genotypes of the PRRS virus (PRRSV) have been identified: European (type 1) and North American (type 2). There are considerable genetic and virulence differences between and within PRRSV genotypes (1\u20133) correlated with a lack of cross-protection by vaccines (4\u20138). Highly pathogenic strains of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) have been identified within both genotypes (9\u201311). Depending on viral strain and immune status of the host, some swine farms may have pigs subclinically infected, whereas others experience severe reproductive, and/or respiratory disease. Infection with both \u201cclassical\u201d and highly pathogenic strains is associated with aberrant host immune response (9, 12).",

Infection with certain PRRSV strains induced significant suppression of NK cell cytotoxic activity (18). The quantity of pro-inflammatory cytokines is significantly lower than in other viral infections and is strain dependent (19). PRRSV is also a poor inducer of IFN-\u03b1. Infection with PRRSV induces an antibody response (production) by 7\u20139 DPI but with no evidence of protection against PRRSV infection; serum neutralizing antibodies appear only later, typically \u226528 days PI (20). The virus also evades host cell-mediated immunity most likely by the promotion of immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 resulting in delayed onset of Th1 immune response (18). Similarly, an immunosuppressive function of PRRSV was shown to probably be mediated by the cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 and action of Treg (21\u201323). Immunosuppression induced by PRRSV facilitates other viral and bacterial infections (18, 24, 25).",

One current trend is the monitoring of antibody levels and shedding of the virus in the oral fluid (41\u201343). In our experiment, the antibody detection rate in the oral fluid collected with ropes in pens was sufficient. The levels of antibodies detected after vaccination were low, but they increased after challenge infection. These findings confirms the possibility of using this approach for preliminary characteristics in the herd. It was interesting to observe the dynamics of antibody levels and viral shedding in feces too. This is an approach which is not often used for PRRSV infection monitoring but is used in other situations where feces samples are more readily available than samples from other sources (47, 48). We were wondering, among other things, to what extent infections occurring systemically, or locally in the respiratory tract occur in this remote compartment. Our findings show that fecal samples can also be used for PRRSV infection monitoring. Detection of both the viruses and antibodies is not entirely consistent, because they appear in individual animals, and cease at later intervals, therefore, it is necessary to consider these findings as approximate. They can be used for herd- or pen- level testing, but not for establishing a diagnosis in individual animals.",

The partial results were provided by each of the three methods used and a comprehensive picture could be obtained by compiling this information. Therefore, it was not possible to use only data of IFN-\u03b3 production in ELISpot, although it is currently the most commonly used method for CMI (5, 29, 37, 38, 49, 50). A positive cell-mediated response after lymphocyte stimulation with specific antigen in vitro (in lymphocyte transformation test) was observed in MLV groups and especially in the B4 group as a non-specific basal stimulation occurred from 21 days post-vaccination in B3 group. The strong non-specific stimulation of PBMC without specific antigen were detected in groups A1 and A2 immunized with inactive types of vaccine. This non-specific stimulation of cells in vivo masks the overall picture, and thus specific cell-mediated immunity cannot be demonstrated. This effect is attributed to the use of strong adjuvants in inactivated types of vaccines. In the test of IFN-\u03b3 production and detection with ELISpot, which is very often used to identify CMI both in experimental studies (5, 37), and in the field (49, 50), we have shown an increase in both blood and cells acquired by lavage, but the individual variability among the animals was too high and, consequently, there were no differences found between the groups under study. We detected also IFN-\u03b3 producing lymphocytes after PRRS antigen stimulation in all immunized groups 7 days after infection. The most marked differences from control were found in CD4\u2212CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ (and partly also in CD3\u2212CD8+ and \u03b3\u03b4+CD8+) subsets of lymphocytes. The CD4\u2212CD8+ subpopulation belongs to cytotoxic groups of cells, CD4+CD8+ is considered a group of Th1 memory cells (51). In another study the expression of cytotoxic CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8\u2212 was described which help to recover from PRRS infection (52).",

Nevertheless it should be noted that we have applied Progressis to piglets in our study, while the manufacturers declare the use of this vaccine for gilts and sows. Cell-mediated immunity was detected only after infection, high non-specific cell stimulation was detected after vaccination and therefore any specific response could not be demonstrated in these intervals. The antigen specific cell mediated immunity after inactivated vaccine is rarely described (50). Most work describes low or no CMI after vaccination with inactivated vaccine.",

There was an obvious difference in the quality between the inactivated vaccines, whereas the character of the immune response to both MLV vaccines was similar with only partial differences in the time-related response dynamics. The vaccine B3 (Amervac) showed a more pronounced decrease in virus secretion and a tendency to induce sterile immunity, while B4 (Porcilis) vaccine had a more pronounced of CMI in lymphocyte transformation test. It should be noted that the strain used in Porcilis had a higher genetic link with the Lelystad strain compared to the strain of Amervac (54, 55) which, however, probably did not significantly affect the above characteristics.",

The use of live attenuated vaccines is generally preferred as was also confirmed in our field study (61). In this study, we controlled the infection by a repeated blanket immunization with MLV vaccine (Porcilis), followed by targeted immunization of gilts, and sows. The success of the strategy selected and evidence of virus eradication from the given herd were demonstrated by introducing sentinel animals into a fattening herd. Based on this result, we believe that control programs can be adopted even in herds with continual throughput housing without interrupting production. However, in this case, vaccination is only one of the necessary preconditions and the introduction of very strict principles of good biosecurity is of no less importance.",
