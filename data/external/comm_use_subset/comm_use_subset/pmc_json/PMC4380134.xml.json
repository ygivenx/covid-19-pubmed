HPeV is structurally similar to other picornaviruses because of its\nicosahedral symmetry and appearance on electron microscopy [2]. It was first described in\n1961 as echoviruses 22 and 23 of the genus Enterovirus on the basis\nof serology and clinical presentation on identification from an outbreak of diarrhea\namong children [3]. However,\nfurther studies showed that properties of the virus, such as nucleotide sequence in\nreplication and translation elements, differ from other members of the genus\nEnterovirus. So the virus was re-classified into a new genus,\nParechovirus, and the echoviruses 22 and 23 were re-named HPeV1\nand HPeV2, respectively [4,5,6]. During the past decade,\nseveral other HPeV isolates have been reported; to date, we have the full genome\nsequences for eight HPeV types, HPeV1 to HPeV8, and eight other types, HPeV9 to\nHPeV16, are known based on their viral protein 1 (VP1) sequences (http://www.picornastudygroup.com).",

Nosocomial infection or outbreaks in neonate hospital departments\nseem to play a substantial role in both kinds of HPeV infection [26,27]. More severe consequences\nof HPeV infection, such as acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, and Reye syndrome,\nhave been reported [13,18]; HPeV3 infection results in\nsevere diseases of the CNS and neonatal sepsis [28]. HPeV3 infection is almost exclusively restricted to\ninfants < 3 months old [29], which may be explained by observations of much lower seroprevalence\nof HPeV3 among women of childbearing age as compared with almost universal\nseropositivity for HPeV1 [28,30];\ntherefore, neonates are at increased risk of HPeV3 infection because of reduced\nmaternal antibody protection [31]. HPeV3 differs from HPeV1 by lacking the RGD motif in VP1, so an\nalternative receptor may exist, thus changing the cellular tropism of HPeV3 and\nleading to enhanced ability to spread and replicate in the CNS [32,33].",

The SimPlot analysis revealed the highest similarity\nof HPeV1 KVP6 with HPeV1 strain 7555312 in the highly variable capsid-encoding\nregions VP0, VP3 and VP1, so HPeV1 KVP6 grouped with HPeV1 [35,36] (Fig. 1A); however, in the more\nconserved regions, such as 2C and 3D, HPeV1 KVP6 had higher similarity with\nHPeV7 PAK5045. Such findings may have resulted from a recombination event during\nHPeV evolution [35]. In\naddition, full genome alignment showed that HPeV1 KVP6 shared the highest\nnucleotide sequence homology, 87%, with the HPeV1 strain 7555312 and a mean of\n77% identity with other HPeV isolates (S4 Table). At the polyprotein\nlevel, all isolates possessed a mean of 88% amino acid identity; however, HPeV1\nKVP6 shared 97% amino acid homology with HPeV1 strain 7555312 (Fig. 1B and S5 Table).\nPhylogenetic analysis of structural regions, in particular of VP1 protein\nbecause of its decisive role in molecular typing of HPeV [34], showed the HPeV1 KVP6\nVP1 sequence close to that of HPeV1 strain 7555312 (Fig. 1C), and HPeV1 KVP6 can\nbe typed to HPeV1 clade 1B [35]. In fact, similar findings were noted in the phylogenetic\nanalysis of nonstructural regions (data not shown).",

            "text": "Following virus infection, antiviral innate immune responses are initiated in\nhost cells. The transcription of type I IFN, mainly IFN\u03b2, is rapidly\ninduced via cooperative binding to its promoter by three families of\ntranscription factors: NF-\u03baB, activator protein 1 (AP1) and IRF [52,53]. The secreted\nIFN\u03b2 acts on neighboring cells and activates the STAT pathway via type I\nIFN receptor to induce IRF7 expression, which may result in amplification of\ntype I IFN induction via such a positive feedback mechanism [54]. Among the members of\nIRFs, IRF3 is critically involved in the initial induction of IFN\u03b2 when\ncells are infected by viruses [54]. Although we found that in A549 cells, HPeV1 induced a sustained\nlevel of total IRF3 at both 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C, phosphorylated IRF3,\nthe activated form of IRF3, only emerged and lasted until late infection at\n37\u00b0C, not 39\u00b0C. From the results we just mentioned, high\nincubation temperature inhibited HPeV1 production, especially during late\ninfection. However, at 33\u00b0C, productive HPeV1 did not induce IRF3\nphosphorylation in both A549 and T84 cells. Therefore, the activation of IRF3\nmay be strongly correlated with viral load and also temperature. Our other\ninfection model showed the phenomenon of HPeV-dependent IRF3 activation [41]. Moreover, the effect\nof type I IFN against HPeV1 was inconsistent between A549 and T84 cells in that\ntype I IFN pretreatment inhibited HPeV1 infection in A549 but not T84 cells\nperhaps because of the lower sensitivity of type I IFN signaling in T84\ncells.",
