The large segment of the arenavirus genome encodes for a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) with endonuclease cap snatching activity [2] and a small RING finger protein (Z) with matrix-like functions [3]. The small segment encodes for the viral nucleoprotein (NP), endowed with a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity [4], and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC). Co-translational cleavage of GPC by the cellular signal peptidase produces a 58 amino acid stable signal peptide (SSP), and subsequent posttranslational cleavage by the cellular site 1 protease produces peripheral virion attachment (GP1) and fusion-active transmembrane (GP2) proteins [5]. The members of the Arenaviridae family are divided into two serologically and geographically distinct groups: New and Old World arenaviruses [6]. Five members of the New World clade B arenaviruses (Junin, Guanarito, Sabia, Machupo and Chapare), and the Old World Lassa virus (LASV) and Lujo virus [7] can cause severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans [8].",

An estimated 3\u20135 million people in central and northwestern Argentina are at risk of developing the disease [10], [11]. For the last 50 years, the AHF endemic area has increased nearly ten times in size as a result of the expanding geographic distribution of JUNV natural host\u2013drylands vesper mouse [10]. Moreover, the ease of aerosol infection [12], [13], high case-fatality rate (15\u201342%) [14], [15], and the lack of virus-specific drugs [16], [17] make JUNV a potential candidate for weaponization.

The non-pathogenic clade B arenavirus Tacaribe, but not the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV, was documented to induce pronounced CPE in Vero cells and conglomeration of human blood purified monocytes [22]. Exposure of PS, a phospholipid component kept on the inner-leaflet of cell membranes in normal cells, on the surface of transformed mouse monocytes/macrophages infected with Pichinde virus (a New World arenavirus that is non-pathogenic for humans) has been described [24]. A recent report [23] documented an absence of apoptosis induction in Vero E6 cells infected with the Romero strain of JUNV. The lack of apoptosis in these cells was proposed to be mediated by the caspase decoy function of Romero NP [23].",

We also showed that siRNA-mediated down-regulation of RIG-I or IRF3 production in A549 cells resulted in drastic reduction of STAT1 phosphorylation and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction in response to Candid#1 infection. These data revealed RIG-I as a primary trigger of type I IFN signaling in response to JUNV infection in A549 cells [33]. We also observed that the ISG response was substantially reduced at the mRNA level in A549 cells infected with the virulent Romero strain compared with that of Cadid#1-infected cells, indicating that Candid#1 might be a more potent stimulator of the RIG-I/IRF3 signaling pathway than Romero. However, both viruses were resistant to the antiviral effect of type I or II IFN pre-treatment in Vero cells indicating that the attenuation of Candid#1 is not related to a higher susceptibility to the antiviral status induced by these cytokines [33].",

Specifically, IFN-I-independent, caspase-9, Apaf-1-dependent signaling trough RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS-mediated induction of Puma and Noxa transcription [36], [40]; or MAVS mediated IFN-I, IRF3, NF-\u039aB-independent, caspase-3, -9-dependent [35]; or IFN-I, NF-\u039aB-independent, RIG-I-TRAF3/TRAF2/TRAF6\u2013mediated IRF3 interaction with Bax protein [38], [39] has been shown to activate mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in response to dsRNA or viral infection. We observed that infection with Candid#1 JUNV induces CPE in primate cell lines. These findings led us to hypothesize that Candid#1 infection induces a RLH-mediated type I IFN-independent apoptosis. In this study we have used different experimental approaches to test our hypothesis. Here we demonstrated apoptosis induction in two human cell lines and Vero cells upon infection with the attenuated Candid#1 vaccine strain of JUNV as determined by PS translocation, CASP3 activation, PARP cleavage and/or chromosome DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, to investigate the potential role of apoptosis induction in Candid#1 attenuation or JUNV pathogenesis we assayed cell death induction in response to the pathogenic Romero as well. We found that the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV was less cytopathic than Candid#1 in human hepatocarcinoma and Vero cells as determined by DNA fragmentation. However, stronger apoptosis induction was observed in A549 and Vero E6 cells in response to Romero infection. Additionally, we found that JUNV-induced apoptosis was enhanced by RIG-I signaling but independent of production of type I IFN.",

Previously, RLH signaling has been linked to apoptosis induction [35]\u2013[39]. We, therefore, were interested in examining a possible role of RIG-I signaling in apoptosis induction during Candid#1 and Romero infection. For this we first used a siRNA-based approach to down-regulate expression levels of RIG-I and IRF3 in A549 cells as described [33]. Initially we explored the feasibility of this approach using only Candid#1. At 1.5 days post siRNA transfection, cells were mock-infected or infected with Candid#1. Consistent with previous findings [33] both mock-and Candid#1-infected cells transfected with IRF3-specific siRNA exhibited efficient silencing of IRF3 expression (70\u201380% reduction) at 1 and 2.5 days p.i. as determined by western blotting (Fig. 2A). Similarly to our published data [33], RIG-I expression was induced by Candid#1 at 1 and 2.5 days after infection, since RIG-I is an IFN-stimulated gene. The induction was observed even in the cells transfected with RIG-I-specific siRNA (Figure 2A). Induction of RIG-I expression in response to Candid#1 infection occurred at the time as apoptotic changes became detectable; that made it experimentally difficult to examine the extent of RIG-I contribution to the apoptosis induction. Therefore, we decided not to perform the same experiment with Romero virus in the BSL-4 laboratory. Nevertheless, even the transient knockdown of RIG-I, and to the lesser extent of IRF3, resulted in increased cell viability of Candid#1-infected cells. At 2.5 days p.i. cell viability was 55.4\u00b11.8 and 67.1\u00b12.4% in IRF3 and RIG-I knockdown cells, respectively, versus 48.6\u00b11.4% in Candid#1-infected cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2B). Increased cell survival in RIG-I and IRF3 knockdown Candid#1-infected cells was observed despite 9.3- and 3.7-fold higher virus production, respectively, as compared with that of cells transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 2C). This observation suggests that the increased cell viability was not due to a reduced viral replication.",

Romero infection of Vero E6 cells led to detectable cytoplasmic nucleosome formation (1.9- and 5.3-fold of that in mock-infected Vero E6 cells at days 3 and 4 p.i., respectively). Though, DNA fragmentation in these cells was delayed (3\u20134 days p.i.) and reduced, relative to that of Candid#1 infection of Vero cells (Fig. 3D). Detection of increased levels of cytoplasmic nucleosomes in type I IFN-deficient Vero cells upon Candid#1 and VeroE6 cells upon Romero infection suggests that type I IFN production is not required for JUNV-induced apoptosis.

In agreement with that in the current study we have demonstrated an induction of cell death in human cells upon infection with vaccine strain of JUNV, Candid#1. Moreover, for the first time, we confirmed the apoptotic nature of this cell death using four different experimental approaches: 1) PS flipping (detected via Annexin V binding) from the inner to the outer membrane layer of cell that at the same time exclude viability dye is indicative of early apoptosis; 2) Transition over time from early (Annexin V positive, viability dye negative) to late apoptotic state (Annexin V and viability dye positive) provides confirmation of cell death via the apoptotic pathway [46]; 3) Fragmentation of cell DNA as a result of nuclease activation, which is a hallmark of late apoptosis [47], results in mono- and oligo-nucleosome formation that can be quantified using ELISA and 4) Detection of the cleaved CASP3 and PARP is a well-accepted surrogate of activation of the apoptotic cell death pathway.

The magnitude and kinetics of apoptosis induction in Huh7 and Vero cells were stronger upon infection with attenuated strain of JUNV. It seems conceivable that an induction of apoptosis upon Candid#1 infection in cells of mononuclear lineage, JUNV primary target [50]\u2013[54] or parenchymal cells, may contribute to the host antiviral response by limiting virus replication and spread, as well as increasing clearance and immunogenicity of infected cells [46], [55], [56]. For instance, immunogenicity of apoptotic cancer cells has been attributed to the exposure of calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperon, on the cell surface during early apoptosis. TLR4 on immature DCs recognizes calreticulin, stimulating antigen processing and presentation. The release of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) chromatin-binding protein to the extracellular space during late apoptosis has the same effect [55], [56]. Moreover, mouse macrophages have been shown to specifically phagocytose apoptotic mouse thymocytes with PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane [46]. At the same time, a pathogenic role of apoptosis induction in response to viral infections has been documented [57], [58]. In macaque, guinea pig and type I and II IFN receptor deficient mouse models of Argentine hemorrhagic fever multiple tangible body macrophages have been detected in spleen of infected animals [59]\u2013[61]. Germinal center tingible body macrophages contain stainable condensed chromatin fragments of phagocytized, apoptotic cells [62]. Moreover, chromatolysis and pyknosis in neurons suggestive of neuronal apoptosis and/or necrosis was detected in a study of 10 autopsy cases of AHF [63]. These observations do not indicate that infected cells undergo apoptosis, however, they suggest a possible pathogenic role of apoptosis in JUNV infection.",

Likewise, deficiencies in RLH or apoptotic pathways often result in enhanced viral replication or pathogenicity in cultured cells and animal models [34], [39]. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated down-regulation of RIG-I and IRF3 expression increased viability of Candid#1-infected A549 cells despite enhanced viral production. Transient effect of siRNA knockdown and the ISG nature of RIG-I could have contributed to the moderate increase we observed in cell viability and virus production in infected cells. We also found drastically reduced DNA fragmentation in RIG-I deficient A549 RIG-I KD and Huh7.5 cells infected with JUNV relative to that of the corresponding infected RIG-I competent controls. Our data indicate that RIG-I contributes to induction of the programmed cell death in response to JUNV infection. Supporting type I IFN independent mechanism of apoptosis induction in response to JUNV infection, we detected DNA fragmentation in Candid#1- or Romero-infected type I IFN-deficient Vero or VeroE6 cells, respectively.",

These seemingly conflicting findings may be related to the sensitivity of the assays used to evaluate apoptosis. In the aforementioned study the absence of apoptosis in Romero-infected Vero E6 cells was based on the lack of visible chromatin condensation by microscopic examination after DAPI staining and undetectable PARP/CASP3 cleavage as determined by western blotting [23]. In contrast, we have used an ELISA-based assay that allowed us to detect and quantify formation of mono- and oligo-nucleosome in low number of cells (assay detection limit is 1000 cells). These data illustrate the need of using several alternative and carefully characterized assays to study the interplay between JUNV infection and host apoptosis response.",

Additionally, we documented apoptosis induction in human lung epithelial carcinoma cells in response to Candid#1 infection using four different experimental approaches. Similarly, we detected pronounced DNA fragmentation in two human cell lines upon Romero infection. Only in Vero E6 cells we observed a lack of considerable apoptosis upon Candid#1-infection. Likewise, DNA fragmentation was significantly reduced in Romero-infected Vero E6 cells relative to that of Candid#1-infected Vero cells. These results suggest that absence/reduction of apoptosis induction in JUNV-infected Vero E6 cells could be a clone-specific phenomenon. It is possible that a host factor required for Candid#1 induced apoptosis is present in the majority of Vero cells, but absent in the sub-population of cells that were selected as Vero E6 clone. Similarly to our data, CPE in response to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection was significantly delayed and less profound in Vero E6 cells compare with that of Vero cell [64]. Future studies of molecular defect(s) in Vero E6 should help to address the inability of these cells to undergo apoptosis upon infection with JUNV.",
