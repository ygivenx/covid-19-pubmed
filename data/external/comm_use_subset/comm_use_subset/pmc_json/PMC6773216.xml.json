PDCoV was first discovered in the rectal swab of pigs in Hong Kong and was initially reported in 2012 [2, 3]. In 2014, it appeared in the state of Ohio in the United States, resulted in outbreaks of diarrheal disease of piglets and sows accompanied by 30~40% mortality rates in piglets, and later rapidly spreading to several other states adjacent to Ohio [4, 5]. At present, PDCoV has been identified in multiple countries including Canada, South Korea, Thailand, and China [6\u20139]. Although a variety of PDCoV detection approaches have been established and effectively used for diagnostic tests, such as one-step quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [10, 11]. However, there are still no effective treatments and control measures for swine PDCoV infections due to its mechanism of PDCoV infections is mostly remained unknown.",

When a virus invades a host cell, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are recognized by host cell pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), primarily consisting of toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and cytoplasmic DNA sensors. Subsequently, PRRs stimulate signaling that triggers an innate immune response inducing the production of type I interferons (I-IFNs), mainly consisting of several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes and IFN-\u03b2. I-IFNs are the major antiviral cytokines of innate immune response that mediate related responses resulting in the production of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in order to control virus replication [12, 13, 14].",

            "text": "To successfully proliferate in host cells, multiple types of coronaviruses have evolved different strategies in order to evade cell innate immune response either by inhibiting the production of I-IFN or by disrupting I-IFN-involved innate immune signaling pathways. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can induce the formation of acute respiratory distress in human beings and has a mortality rate close to 10%. SARS-CoV has gained widespread attention since it first emerged as a huge threat to humans in 2002. In order to explore the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV, various studies have focused on cellular mechanisms, including innate immune response evasion. Kopecky-Bromberg SA et al. found that the nucleocapsid (N) protein which encoded by SARS-CoV againsts IFN-\u03b2 production by inhibiting IRF-3, the key protein necessary for the expression of IFN-\u03b2 [15]. Furtherly, Hu Y et al. found that N protein of SARS-CoV interfers with RIG-I activation and ubiquitination which mediated by tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), resulting in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production which achieve higher SARS-CoV replication in host cells [16]. In addition to SARS-CoV, the N protein of other coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), has also been identified as an innate immunity antagonist. RIG-I and melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5) are both PRRs that can recognize PAMPs and then activate signaling to promote I-IFN production. MHV N protein inhibits the synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 by interacting with the protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT), which can bind to RIG-I and MDA5, promoting the production of IFN-\u03b2 [17]. As an avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) escapes innate immune response by cleaving the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which disrupts downstream of RIG-I and MDA5, antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 synthesis [18].",

            "text": "In terms of PDCoV, there are also several strategies have been evolved to escape innate immune response. PDCoV acts against the innate immune response by impeding the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-\u03baB, both of which are involved in the RIG-I signaling pathway disrupting IFN-\u03b2 production [19]. Nonstructural protein 5 (NSP5), which is encoded by PDCoV, antagonizes I-IFN signaling through modulation of the Jak/STAT signaling pathway by cleaving STAT2, resulting in the disruption of ISGs production [20]. The NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO) is a critical constituent of the IKK complex (IKK-\u03b1, IKK-\u03b2, and IKK-\u03b3) involved in downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling, which is necessary for I-IFN production. The cleavage of NEMO caused by NSP5 impedes the synthesis of I-IFN [21]. In addition to nonstructural proteins, accessory proteins such as NS6 encoded by PDCoV also play an important role in the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production by interfering with the binding of RIG-I/MDA5 and PDCoV [22]. However, the alteration of host cell innate immune response affected by PDCoV infection still needs to be explored. In particular, the main innate immune-associated genes and signaling pathways of host cell modulated by PDCoV have not yet been uncovered, which can hinder further discoveries regarding the mechanism of PDCoV infection.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of short noncoding RNAs known as gene regulators that can modulate extensive bioprocesses by repressing the expression of their target genes at the translation level and/or mRNA level. It has been reported that the expression of miRNAs in host cells can be changed by multiple coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [23, 24, 25, 26]. Some of the host cell endogenous miRNAs have been found to play important roles in the modulation of innate immune response affected by coronavirus. On one hand, host cell-derived miRNAs can enhance the innate immune response to inhibit the replication of coronaviruses. For excample, miRNA-221-5p (miR-221-5p) activates NF-\u03baB signaling pathway which leads to the upregulation of I-IFN and the downstream ISGs as well as the suppression of PEDV replication [27]. On the other hand, cell endogenous miRNAs also can inhibit innate immune repsonse resulting in coronaviruses innate immune evasion. For example, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 \u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) modulates the decreasing of miR-30a-5p which involved in the signaling pathway of miR-30a-5p/SOCS1/3, resulting in the promotion of TGEV\u2019s replication by escaping innate immune response [28]. Interferon stimulatory gene (IFITM1) is a target of miR-130a. Knockdown of miR-130a can increase the expression of IFITM1 resulting in the inhibition of HCV replication, which indicate that miR-130a directly involves in innate immune evasion of HCV [29]. As of yet, however, there has been no research into the host cell endogenous miRNAs which may involve in innate immune response modulation affected by PDCoV infection.",

Namely, DEGs upregulated in cells at 24 hpi compared to uninfected cells and DEGs downregulated in cells at 36 hpi compared to cells at 24 hpi were selected for further analysis with GO function enrichment. For INF_24h versus NC, genes which were upregulated in cells at 24 hpi were enriched in 99 terms of BP, 3 terms of CC, and 9 terms of MF (S4 Table). Most of these genes were associated with response against viruses, host defense response, and immune response (Fig 8A). In another comparison group, genes with downregulated tendencies in cells at 36 hpi were enriched in 65 terms of BP, 1 term of CC, and 2 terms of MF (S5 Table). These genes mainly enriched in the functions related to host defense responses, such as defense response, response to external biotic stimuli, response to external stimuli, and in the functions of cytokines involved in immune and innate immune response, such as cytokine activity and cytokine receptor binding (Fig 8B). Since genes annotated with GO terms associated with immune and innate immune responses were commonly shared, the enriched immune and innate immune response-related GO terms were both selected to represented (Tables 2 and 3).",

However, even in the absence of TGEV and PEDV, PDCoV has high pathogenicity, making it worthy of significant concern. In general, PDCoV was the only pathogenic factor among these three viruses, which could be detected in feces and intestinal samples and associated with outbreaks of swine diarrheal disease in the U.S. in 2014 [12]. To date, the infection mechanisms of TGEV and PEDV at the mRNA or miRNA levels have already been revealed by high-throughput sequencing, which has delineated the key genes (or miRNAs) and signaling pathways involved in the process of viral infection [26, 35].

By comparing the expressed genes in cells at 0 and 24 hpi, we found that most of the innate immune-associated genes were significantly upregulated at 24 hpi comparing to cells without PDCoV infection. The results indicated that I-IFN-mediated innate immune response was triggered during PDCoV at an early infection time point (24 hpi). In the comparison between cells at 24 hpi and 36 hpi, the PRRs and ISGs described above which were elevated significantly in INF_24h versus NC were not downregulated significantly in cells at 36 hpi comparing to cells at 24 hpi, but the significant inhibition of I-IFNs expression still can be found. The result indicated that the I-IFNs production was reduced at 36 hpi comparing to 24 hpi which also indicated that the I-IFN response might be inhibited at 36 hpi induced by PDCoV. The reason that the PRRs or ISGs described above were not significantly down-regulated at this infection time point may due to there are other key molecules which regulated by PDCoV for suppression of I-IFNs production or I-IFN response at 36 hpi. Besides, the results also indicated that the genes which regulated by PDCoV in a relative early infection time (24 hpi) and a relative late infection time (36 hpi) for innate immune response modulation were different.",
