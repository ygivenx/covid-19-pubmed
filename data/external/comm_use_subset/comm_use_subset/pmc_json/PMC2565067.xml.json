HIV adversely affects each stage of the natural history of HCV infection. Fewer individuals recover spontaneously from HCV infection when also infected with HIV [2]. Among those with persistent HCV infection, HIV co-infection is associated with higher HCV viremia and more rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [3]. A recent meta-analysis showed that HIV co-infection increased the risk of histological hepatic cirrhosis by two-fold and clinically decompensated liver disease by six-fold [4]. In addition, HCV co-infection is associated with increased incidence of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) related liver injury [5].",

Ex-vivo HCV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) from mono-infected individuals are generally weak [8]. Although, peripheral HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are somewhat weaker in HCV/HIV co-infected individuals [9], similar frequencies of intra-hepatic HCV-specific responses appear to be obtained in HCV versus HCV/HIV co-infection [10], [11]. However, ex-vivo HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in PBMCs from HIV mono-infected individuals are about one log higher than ex-vivo HCV-specific responses in HCV mono-infection. In addition, impairment in cellular immune responses to HCV compared to HIV has been shown in HCV/HIV co-infection [12]. HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells are easily detectable in blood of untreated HIV infected individuals [13]. Such high frequencies of HIV-specific T-cells circulating in peripheral blood led us to question whether these cells could also migrate to the liver in HCV/HIV co-infection and through bystander responses add to the inflammation induced by HCV-specific T-cells.",

HIV-specific T-cells from blood had a more expanded functional hierarchy.

            "text": "This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of HIV-specific T-cells within the liver of HCV/HIV co-infected individuals. The finding of HIV-specific T-cells within liver of co-infected individuals may not altogether be surprising, given the high frequencies of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells found in the peripheral blood in untreated HIV infection. Nevertheless, it is surprising to find functional T-cells of such viral specificities to be accumulating in liver. In contrast, we could not detect CMV-specific T-cells in co-infected liver despite their abundance in blood indicating that different viruses target T-cells to the liver. Recent studies have demonstrated that systemic viral infections may recruit viral-specific T-cells to the liver. The significance of non-hepatotropic viral-specific T-cells that are found in liver is unclear. It has been postulated that the liver can non-selectively trap activated T-cells during any infection, and thus act as a \u2018sink\u2019 or \u2018graveyard\u2019[18], however it is unclear whether these cells are rendered anergic while traveling in the liver or contribute to inflammation and damage as a result of bystander activation. Of note, is that hepatitis has been observed in measles [19], SARS [20] and in 20% of individuals with acute HIV infection [21]. Polakos et. al.[22] found that some individuals infected with influenza-A develop transaminitis and showed in a murine influenza model that influenza-specific CD8+ T-cells migrate to the liver and induce hepatic damage from by-stander activation. Non-hepatotropic viruses such as HIV, CMV and EBV, in general do not induce chronic hepatitis, thus, it is possible that the co-existence of hepatotropic viruses may alter the hepatic environment to allow recruitment of activated T-cells non-specifically. This could be due to an up-regulation of integrins such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in hepatic sinusoids as previously shown during HCV infection [23] that could enhance T-cell recruitment. In this regard, Spangenberg et. al.[24] demonstrated the presence of influenza-specific T-cells in about 50% of liver biopsies from HCV mono-infected individuals.",

There is also evidence for the detection of HIV RNA in the liver of HIV infected individuals [26]. These findings support the identification of HIV-specific T-cells in the liver. In HCV/HIV co-infection, it is possible that intra-hepatic HCV-specific CD4+ T-cells become infected with HIV and recruit HIV-specific immune responses to this site.

This observation may explain the added contribution of HIV-specific immune responses to the ongoing intra-hepatic damage induced by HCV-specific T-cell responses that are inefficient in clearing the virus. Therapy na\u00efve co-infected individuals demonstrated a higher frequency of intra-hepatic CD8+ T-cells that produce TNF-\u03b1 in response to both HCV and HIV antigen stimulation compared to HCV mono-infected individuals. In addition, we identified CD8+ T-cells specific for an immunodominant HIV epitope in co-infected liver, demonstrating high frequency of TNF-\u03b1 expression. Intra-hepatic TNF-\u03b1 has been previously associated with liver fibrosis, and the accumulation of cells expressing this marker may explain in part the faster rate of liver disease progression found in HCV/HIV co-infection. Further comparisons of TNF-\u03b1 responses between immunodominant HCV and other HIV epitopes in a larger cohort of individuals are warranted. Contrary to our expectation, viral-specific, intra-hepatic levels of IFN-\u03b3 were also higher in the therapy-na\u00efve co-infected group, which would be against the expected protective role of IFN-\u03b3. However, we interpret this observation as a potential effect of the fibrogenic TNF-\u03b1 to mask IFN-\u03b3 protection. On the other hand, viral-specific T-cells are composed of several major populations with unique functional patterns. Therefore, measurement of only one or two T-cell functions may not provide a comprehensive picture of the quality of T-cell responses.",

            "text": "Recent lines of evidence demonstrate the importance of the qualitative rather than quantitative characteristics of CD8+ T-cell responses to efficient viral control [13], [27]. The significance of T-cell populations simultaneously representing 5 different functions has been discussed as a hierarchical functional model in viral infections such as CMV and EBV which are effectively controlled by respective CD8+ T-cells [16]. HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells were not poly-functional which is consistent with the notion that although HCV-specific T-cells are found in hepatic tissue, their loss of poly-functionality may be associated with inefficient control of HCV replication. HIV-specific T-cells in the liver of co-infected individuals however, simultaneously could express 4 and 5 of the measured markers. Recently, T-cell exhaustion has been related to signaling pathways through PD-1 [28], [29]. Our analysis of PD-1 levels of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells from co-infected liver demonstrates higher expression of PD-1 on HCV-specific T-cells, compared to those specific for HIV, supporting the notion that the former are less functional. The observed poly-functionality of intra-hepatic HIV-specific T-cells, should have little effect on HCV replication but would further enhance the cytokine milieu induced from bystander activation, and contribute to liver damage during co-infection with HCV. In this regard, we found that the degranulation marker CD107a dominates the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the liver, with the majority of the responding cells expressing CD107a, a surrogate marker for the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T-cells. Activated HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells with the potential to degranulate could induce bystander damage. In addition, the release of chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b2 by the same cells could also attract further lymphocytes without HCV specificity to the liver. Bystander function of these non-specific T-cells could expand the tissue damage triggered by HCV infection and ultimately activate fibrogenesis.",

HAART-treated biopsies showed further reduced frequencies of HCV-specific responses. These data support previous findings that show HAART induces CD4+ T-cell recovery but not any restoration of HCV-specific T-cell responses peripherally [30]. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of CD4+ T-cell help in affecting the frequencies of HCV-specific CD8+ T-cells in HCV/HIV-1 co-infection.

All data are reported after background correction. Nonspecific background is shown to become extremely low when examining combinations of functions, nearly reaching 0 events for multiple functions simultaneously. This permits a very low threshold for detection of positive responses from multiple combinations. Consequently, for multi-parameter analysis, the results were thresholded based on a minimum criterion of positivity, as calculated by SPICE software and presented as the 90th percentile of negative values for each analysis. Each pie chart generated by SPICE software, represents the hierarchy of responses to either HCV or HIV antigen stimulation. For simplicity, responses are grouped by number of functions and matched to the colored bars, with black bars representing the percentage of responding cells to HIV peptides and gray bars representing the percentage of responses to HCV peptide stimulation.
