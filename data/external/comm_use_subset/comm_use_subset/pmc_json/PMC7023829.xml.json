The virus has a wide host range in many mammalian families, including dogs, cats, ferrets, minks and raccoons (Kapil et al., 2007). CPV is a non-enveloped virus, single-stranded DNA virus in the Parvoviridae family (Cotmore et al., 2014). The compact genome (approximately 5,000 nt) encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) through an alternative splicing of the same mRNAs (Berns & Parrish, 2007). CPV is globally distributed, and this virus has been evolutionarily diverged from CPV-1 to its present forms of CPV-2 subtypes; CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c (Truyen, 2006). CPV-2 can cause severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs, owing to amino acid substitutions harboring at VP2 capsid protein (Truyen, 2006).",

The miRNA biogenesis starts with a long nucleotide sequences of the miRNAs which are folded into hairpin configuration, known as \u201cprimary miRNAs or pri-miRNAs\u201d. Later on, the shortening and editing of pri-miRNAs occurred by the activity of Drosha and DGCR9 enzymes, making a shorter version of miRNAs and soon to be called \u201cpre-miRNA\u201d. The pre-miRNA, an ~70-nucleotide in length, is exported to the cytosol where the Dicer repeatedly chops the sequences once again here to make an ~20-bp miRNA/miRNA* duplex (Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010). The functional miRNA, ~18\u201322 nt long, represents a mature miRNA, which can be incorporated into the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). The miRNAs, altogether with its cognate target mRNAs, function as gene expression regulators as part of miRISC by preventing protein translation, mRNA deadenylation, and mRNA target cleavage (Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010).",

Some miRNAs are involved in the regulation of genes related to the specific process in mammalian cells, such as cell differentiation, cell migration, cell signaling, various pathologies and apoptosis (Bartel, 2004; Krol, Loedige & Filipowicz, 2010). Some particular miRNAs may have a universal function during virus establishment and infections. Understanding the involvement of host factors in virus infection, modulated by miRNAs, may facilitate the discovery of potential intervention candidates, that is, therapeutic silencing of miR-122 in chronic hepatitis C virus infection (Henke et al., 2008). The potential targets of conserved and novel miRNAs could be predicted using sequence homology algorithms across different mammalian species. The deregulation of miRNA can involve in tumorigenesis, and some miRNAs are known to behave as an oncogene or tumor suppressor genes (Bartel, 2004). Furthermore, miRNAs have great potential as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. However, the change of miRNA expression profiles in CPV in tissue culture systems has not been fully elucidated.",

In the present study, we performed and utilized high throughput approach via miRNA-seq experiments to identify the altered miRNA profiling in miRNA libraries of uninfected and CPV-2c infected Crandell Reese Feline Kidney (CRFK) cells. Among miRNA repertoire retrieved from sequencing libraries, we would expect to see a dramatic expression of many miRNAs, but interestingly, miR-1247-3p appears to be one associated with cellular and humoral host defense response to CPV. At this point, there is little or nothing known about miR-1247 regarding its functionality related to CPV or other viruses. In this report, we have identified the targets of miR-1247-3p, along with other miRNAs; miR-222-5p, miR-365-2-5p, miR-322-5p and miR-361-3p, in CRFK cell infected with CPV-2c.

The correlation between samples is an important indicator for testing the reliability of the experiment. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the greater the similarity of the samples. ENCODE suggests that the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient should be larger than 0.92, under ideal experimental conditions (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004). In this project, the R2 were larger than 0.93 (Fig. 3A). Variations among technical replicates were minimal. These observations can also be confirmed by the correlation matrix.

The mixed gene expression pattern in exploratory miRNA species heterogeneity in Control and CPV infection was retrieved from sRNA-seq. To reduce the complexity of data for interpretation (n = 420, mapped mature miRNAs), we have performed and used the dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to review our miRNA expression data (Fig. 3C). Because of high-dimensional datasets, this technique can be implemented, allowing it to be applied to large real-world datasets, resulting in well suited for the easy visualization. To identify the read count subset defined by specific miRNA gene expression signatures, unsupervised clustering of 420 mature miRNAs were identified and clustered into two groups by t-SNE, matching the known heterogeneity of transcripts of miRNA genes. The t-SNE visualization of Control/CPV showed limited overlap between two miRNA libraries. The t-SNE result of a mixture of miRNAs in Control in combination with infected-cells (CPV) showed dividing data into 2 clusters, as depicted by dots with different color schemes (cluster A\u2013B, Fig. 3C). For heatmap and hierarchical clustering, the Control and CPV-infected cells could be customarily segmented into visibly two patterns of detection, up- and down-regulated of miRNA genes, with the broad range of uses. Four categorized groups were determined by the representation of heatmap based mainly on Z-score; namely from high (red) to low (green) or base-line expression (black or mixed colored), respectively (Fig. 3D).",

            "text": "The functional genes in the GO process can be overlapping at certain points in the pathway, though this was obviously modulated by miR-1247-3p in this study. For example, we found that genes: ABL1, ADA, BAX, BCL3, BCL6, BMI1, BMP4, CTNNB1, DLL1, GATA3, GLI3, IL6, LEF1, NLRP3, PSEN1, SFRP1, SOCS5, WNT1, XBP1 can be partially intersected in lymphocyte activation involved in immune response, lymphocyte differentiation, negative regulation of cell communication, and negative regulation of cell death pathways. When many affected genes by miRNAs have converged, it will be amplified the signals or expansion of its functions to adjacent gene network. The synergism among genes within GO biological processes in reacting to virus infections, as anticipated in CPV as well, is a common paradigm for effective host defense response. Of the thirty-three GO process categories discovered in the current study, IL-6 was remarkably important cytokine, as a key for marginal zone B cell differentiation, negative regulation of cytokine production, and lymphocyte differentiation, by its action (Safi et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018).",

The miR-1247-3p, accompanying by other significant DEGs, as earlier discussed, can be linked to further experimental observations, leading directions for further work and implication for clinical use.",
