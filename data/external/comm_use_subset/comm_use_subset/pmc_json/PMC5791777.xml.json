Other pathogens, notably influenza A (H7N9), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Nipah virus, have demonstrated their capacity to become global threats. In parallel, the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has become a pressing global health threat that challenges both the human and animal health sectors. The prospect of a post-antibiotic era prompted a high-level consultation on antimicrobial resistance at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly. It was only the fourth such occasion Member States convened and issued a declaration associated with a developing health crisis.2",

The World Bank estimates the global cost of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic at 30 billion United States dollars (US$).3 The 2013\u20132016 Ebola virus disease outbreak was associated with US$ 2.2 billion in lost economic growth for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone alone.4 Total costs attributable to both income loss and premature mortality from a moderately severe influenza pandemic are projected at US$ 570 billion annually, which is within the range of the annual cost associated with global climate change.5 Without intervention, the cumulative economic impact of antimicrobial resistance through 2050 is anticipated to exceed US$ 100 trillion, two-thirds of which would be in low- and middle-income countries, substantially more than current annual global economic output.6",

Strengthened multidisciplinary national capacities would bring additional benefits by improving prevention and control of endemic disease in human and animal populations. This improvement would initiate a cascade effect that would be expected to include lower rates of infectious disease-associated morbidity, reduced antimicrobial demand and ultimately, a scaling back of pressures fostering drug resistance.",

Where the analyses have been performed, results have not always gained support from budget decision-makers, limiting their translation into policies. In part, this resistance can be attributed to the dual constraints of competing priorities for human and veterinary health systems funding, and to the difficulty in mobilizing sufficient resources to fund infrastructure and risk mitigation efforts. Furthermore, there is limited investment in evidence-based animal reservoir surveillance and research of wildlife and environmental factors associated with emergence of infectious diseases. This limitation has frequently resulted in a general lack of awareness among policy-makers of upstream prevention opportunities, indirectly adding to resistance in adjusting priorities. Considering the broad array of factors contributing to the emergence of infectious disease, bridging inequitable distribution of costs and benefits across sectors and stakeholders also remains an obstacle.",

This evidence must capture and quantify the cost of inaction. It will be important to account for previously hidden losses, reduced trade revenue, financial market shocks, social order disruption, premature mortality, increased all-cause morbidity and lost wages, stemming from epidemics and pandemics driven by business-as-usual practices, to ensure decisions are made on an equitable-comparison basis.8 Even in the pre-epidemic stage, as with animal-origin influenzas, livestock depopulation, lost productivity and follow-on effects impacting agricultural livelihoods and food security can pose a substantial economic burden.",
