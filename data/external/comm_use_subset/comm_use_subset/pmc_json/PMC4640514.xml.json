The \u201cstandard configuration model\u201d creates networks with a specified degree sequence. In short, a node i with degree d\ni is allocated d\ni \u201cstubs\u201d. Network ties are formed by connecting pairs of stubs at random, thus achieving a network with desired degree sequence. The standard configuration model has proven to be amenable to the study of Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemics (e.g, [5\u20137]). For example, a reproduction ratio, R\n0, and epidemic threshold analogous to those of compartmental models can be expressed. Define transmissibility [5], T, in a homogeneous population with a constant infectious period to be the probability an infected node infects a susceptible neighbour along a single edge. In the early stages of an outbreak on a configuration model network, the expected number of infections caused by a newly infected single node is\nR0=TE(d2)-E(d)E(d)(1)\nwhere E(d) is the mean node degree and E(d\n2) is the mean of the squared node degree (closely related to the variance). For heterogeneous populations and non-constant infectious periods the expression can be generalized to\nR0=E(T)E(d2)-E(d)E(d)\nwhere E(T) is the average transmissibility over all infectious and susceptible nodes [6, 8]. Using bond percolation arguments, an epidemic is possible only when R\n0 > 1 (as for compartmental models), or equivalently the transmissibility exceeds a critical transmissibility [9], T\nc, given by\nTc=E(d)E(d2)-E(d).\n",

Although the degree distribution will be the same, fewer susceptible nodes will be available for an infection in the early stages of an outbreak, and we would expect the critical transmissibility to be higher, although the extent to which Eq (1) must be modified is the subject of research. Miller [8] considers approximations of R\n0 using additional subgraphs, and suggests clustering affects the final epidemic size only if the typical node degrees are small or clustering is very high. The expression for unclustered networks in Eq (1) also serves as a useful guideline and bound.",

In short, single edges are counted separately from triangles. Each node i has s\ni single edges (\u201cstubs\u201d) and t\ni triangle vertices (\u201ccorners\u201d). Networks are formed by connecting pairs of stubs at random and triples of corners at random. The joint distribution of stubs and corners is the analogue to the degree distribution in this model. Volz et al. [12] derive a deterministic solution for an SIR epidemic process on edge-triangle configuration networks. They also derive a solution for final epidemic size of clustered networks that is asymptotically exact for large network sizes using bond percolation approximation methods. Importantly they also extend their results on epidemic dynamics beyond edge-triangle configuration networks to a further generalisation that includes cliques (i.e., fully connected subgraphs) of size 4 and above to model household structure. Cliques of size n are included in the network model by analogy with triangles- size n clique corners are counted in addition to stubs and triangle corners. We note two of their key results. 1) The global clustering coefficient is not sufficient to determine the full epidemiological impact of clustering. Comparing with a different model [13] such that the two models are calibrated to have the same degree distribution, the same global clustering coefficient and the same disease parameters, epidemic dynamics can be quite different, especially when clustering is extensive. Thus, the specific nature of the clustering appears relevant for epidemic dynamics. 2) Clustering slows epidemics and reduces final size, at least for a particular subclass of edge-triangle networks considered (negative binomial degree distribution, tunable fraction of edges in triangles, mean and variance of the degree distribution held constant).",

When the number of contacts per day is large, or the transmissibility of the infection is high (e.g. mumps, measles, pertussis, chickenpox), random mixing models produce adequate results.

A generalisation that allows arbitrary subgraphs beyond cliques has been proposed [15] for which network features (and importantly, percolation results for epidemic dynamics) remain solvable. For example, the necessary generating functions are provided for edges, triangles, squares, diamonds (a square with diagonal, also known as a 2-triangle), and 4-cliques. The joint distribution for node \u201croles\u201d is the key distribution of interest. These five subgraphs require six node roles (i.e., two for the diamond). Analogous to the degree sequence is the \u201crole sequence\u201d which is a vector for each node, counting the number of each role in which that node participates. More general subgraphs could be treated similarly, although the necessary generating function may be complicated or difficult to express. A key question is which subgraphs should be included in the network model for the study of epidemics?\n",

As a class of network models, ERGMs offer several advantages. 1) They allow general subgraphs, called \u201cconfigurations\u201d, without additional machinery. 2) Configurations can share edges as well as nodes. 3) Importantly, they are grounded in hypotheses about social processes underlying network formation. 4) They are parameterised to capture network features relevant to human interaction (e.g., clustering, homophily, social circuit dependence [17, 18]) in a manner that aids interpretation. 5) Very parsimonious models can be shown to capture a large number of network features well. Under a homogeneity assumption whereby all structurally identical subgraphs are equally probable, these models have the form\nPr(Y=y)=exp(\u2211C\u03b8CzC(y))/\u03ba,(2)\nwhere Y = [Y\nij] is an n \u00d7 n binary matrix of variables denoting whether a tie is present (1) or absent (0) and y = [y\nij] denotes a realisation of Y.

            "text": "As has been pointed out (e.g., [15]), in practice ERGMs are difficult to analyse and can display pathological behaviours that limit their usefulness. The former concern is certainly true in the general case, although there has been some progress [19]. Realistically, the study of both ERGM networks and epidemic dynamics on ERGM networks must rely on stochastic simulation of both the networks and epidemics on the networks. Pathological behaviours, which often make model fitting difficult for the earlier Markov models, are less serious with new social circuit specifications for ERGMs [16, 20]. In addition, several other concerns might be raised. 1) Model fitting currently requires Markov Chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation (MCMCMLE) techniques that become computationally intensive as the number of nodes and edges grows. This imposes a practical constraint on the size of networks that can be modelled with ERGMs (although the new snowball methods\u2014see below\u2014open possibilities for parameter estimation of large networks). 2) Model fitting has generally assumed the entire network has been observed, which is unrealistic for large networks. However, recent results [21] have relaxed this \u201cwhole network\u201d requirement such that a \u201csnowball sample\u201d [22] can be used. An alternative approach for less than whole-network data has also been proposed [23]. 3) Model fitting can be tricky, requiring the \u201cright\u201d collection of configurations to be included to adequately capture network features.",

There are additional difficulties when fitting a network model to a network sample rather than a network census [26\u201328]. 1) High degree nodes are more likely to appear in the sample, so their probability will be over-estimated. 2) The samples are sensitive to the initial seed nodes chosen, which in practice may be a convenience sample rather than a random sample. 3) Homophily within the population can lead to some sub-groups being over- or under-represented in the sample, particularly if the set of seed nodes poorly represents the population. While there are techniques to fit ERGMs to snowball sampled data [21], we are not aware of a technique to estimate a network\u2019s node role distribution from a snowball sample. For the purposes of this paper we propose a method to estimate the joint distribution of stubs and corners, thus fitting an edge-triangle model.",

For this study we consider networks given by 75, 60 and 6 minute durations (referred to as HS75, HS60 and HS6 respectively), which give a range of densities. Clearly the network ties from larger c are a subset of the ties from smaller c. We use these three networks to illustrate the effects of increasing network density and connectivity. Details of the networks are provided in Table 1. (To confine comparisons of simulated epidemics to similarly sized networks, isolates have been removed from HS75 and HS60 networks.) Mean node degree increases from 2.5 to 57.5 as shorter duration contacts are included. We also show maximal clique sizes. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be made larger by including an adjacent node (i.e., not a subset of a larger clique). Maximal clique sizes range from 1 to 4 nodes for HS75, to between 1 and 25 nodes for HS6. Loosely, HS75 is a sparse network with small cliques while HS6 is dense with high mean numbers of contacts and large cliques.",

They do not say how to count the subgraphs to create the role sequence or estimate its distribution. To model an empirical network this is most critical. Here we describe our method to form the node role sequence by decomposing the empirical network. For example, to fit an edge-triangle model we first count triangle corners at each node, subject to the condition that two triangles cannot share an edge. Thus, once an edge is identified for a triangle, it is removed from use in future triangles. In this sense we \u201cdecompose\u201d the empirical network by removing edges as node roles are assigned. Edges not counted as part of a triangle are counted as stubs at their incidence nodes and account for all remaining edges. This approach can be generalised when additional subgraphs are included in the model, as described in S1 Appendix for the decomposition for the model with the largest number of subgraphs (i.e., our fourth variation). Finally we note that how one decomposes the empirical network into non-overlapping subgraphs is not unique. In this study the decomposition generally occurs in decreasing size/complexity, starting with the cliques of at least five nodes (most nodes to fewest nodes) and ending with stubs, as shown in S1 Appendix. Note that node roles for triangles are assigned before node roles for 4-cycles to give the most favourable opportunity to capture clustering. Node roles for the truss are assigned after 3-triangles and 4-cliques, but before diamonds, which are a subgraph of the truss.",

In particular, we use the observed role sequence instead of fitting a bivariate probability distribution to the number of stubs and corners. Since the quality of that fit would affect our results, using the observed node role sequence provides more controlled comparisons. Joining random stubs and corners can create self-loops and multiple edges. It has been suggested to maintain these ties [15] since excluding them makes theoretical calculations more difficult. Asymptotically, as the number of nodes grows the density of self-loops and multiple edges goes to zero, so they are not such a concern for larger networks. As in [12], we choose to delete them. Self-loops do not add to epidemic dynamics. Multiple edges do not fit within the framework of a binary incidence matrix, and are inconsistent with decomposing the empirical network into subgraphs that do not share edges.",

All ERGMs for the high school networks in this study contain five configurations for structure and one configuration for homophily based on person type. The edge configuration controls network density. An \u201cisolates\u201d term controls the number of isolates produced by the model.

Boxes show the interquartile range. The central line denotes the median, the whiskers show the range of data not considered outliers, and outliers are shown individually. Where there is no variability the box collapses down to the median. The corresponding value for the empirical network is shown by the horizontal line. Results are reported for an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model (\u201cER\u201d) with the same mean node degree as the empirical network, the standard configuration model (\u201cCM\u201d), an edge-triangle model (\u201cET\u201d), and the four variations which include size four subgraphs (\u201c+sub4\u201d), 3- and 4-triangles (\u201c+34 tri\u201d), trusses (\u201c+truss\u201d), and cliques of size 5 and above (\u201c+clqs5+\u201d).

Thus, the large component diameter is an upper bound on the epidemic duration when the probability of disease transmission is near one and nodes are infected and infectious for one time unit. (If there were more than one seed node per component the epidemic duration would typically be less, but the large component diameter would still be indicative.) There is a large difference between the diameter of the large component in the observed network (31) and all the network models.

For the 468 nodes in the large component, 70 have their maximum to the end of the 8 node chain, and 385 have their maximum to the end of the 14 node chain, 13 are equidistant to both end nodes and three are additional nodes.

However, even in a network with mean node degree of 2.5 we found only small differences arising from the ability of a network model to capture such features. A much larger difference is apparent from what might be considered the absence of clustering in our HS75 network due to long chains off a highly-connected core. The results on epidemic duration show similarity between edge-triangle models and the ERGM, and all show mean epidemic durations that are too short compared to the observed network. Long chains can slow an epidemic by increasing the number of transmissions required to reach nodes and might also increase the number of cutpoints in the network. Each cutpoint has the potential to interrupt the epidemic by transmission failure. Overall, this suggests there may be advantage in exploring subgraphs that promote longer chains in addition to ones that promote increased clustering.",

In the case of the relationships network for example, in developing the ERGM, 31 models were considered (10 with fixed 9-star and same-sex edges) over the course of a week. Some modeller time was saved by performing estimations overnight. Goodness-of-fit results reported here require 2.5 hours to produce and are an essential step to ensure a useful network model has been found. Twelve earlier goodness-of-fit results (2-3 hours each) ruled out earlier models. In a best case scenario, one could anticipate the need to fix features of the network, and get lucky with the choice of configurations in the model. It is still unlikely to develop the model in under two days. On the other hand, fitting an edge-triangle model can be performed with less specialised expertise and in a negligible amount of time.

After some effort optimizing the counting algorithms, it likely would perform faster. Because an edge is assigned to only one subgraph, a feature of the decomposition is that once an edge is assigned it can be removed from further consideration. Thus, decomposition of the network becomes less demanding as more edges are assigned to subgraphs.

We also acknowledge there are modes of contact (e.g., physical non-intimate contact, contact within a household structure) not represented by our examples. Clearly the study described here can be extended to such empirical networks in the future.",

Part of the opportunity this provides is the exciting ability to study temporal network effects on disease transmission. On the other hand, it is not clear that temporal, rather than static, models will always be necessary. The comparisons by Machens et al. [44] illustrate that a static network model that captures contact durations but not temporal ordering can give SEIR results similar to using full empirical data with a time-varying, individual-based contact network with contact start and end events at 20 s resolution. We adopt the view that the timescales for both epidemic dynamics and contact network dynamics determine the extent to which a static network approximation is useful.",

In the case of scale-free networks, the degree distribution is key to understanding epidemic dynamics [51]. Since the edge-triangle type models can use an empirical node degree sequence, or a node degree distribution, we would expect epidemic dynamics of SIR-type infections would be similar. In the case of small-world networks, the key feature is \u201cshortcuts\u201d that make the typical path lengths shorter than an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network. Because the edge-triangle type models randomly re-attach stubs, we would not expect networks from these models to have these shortcuts, and so epidemic dynamics should be more similar to an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi network.",

For the relationships network, most sexually-transmitted diseases would not be modelled as SIR-type. For the PWID network, HIV and hepatitis C are very relevant but would not be modelled as SIR-type. It would be interesting to extend our results to more general infection parameters and types of infections. Edge-based compartmental modelling is a new technique that extends epidemiological results for configuration models to dynamic network models and models where the population has additional heterogeneity (demographic features, multiple types of risk behaviour) and the disease has more complicated history [33, 42]. Unfortunately these methods are not appropriate for SIS-type infections, where the risk of reinfection violates the assumptions underlying simplifications in the calculations. The need for direct simulation, possibly with ERGMs, has not been eliminated for SIS-type infections. Our results could also be extended by looking for differences between the models when a vaccination or treatment is administered. These extensions are left for future work.",
