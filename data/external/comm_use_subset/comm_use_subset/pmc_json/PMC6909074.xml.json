            "text": "Carbon is an excellent biocompatible, largely non-toxic, and environmentally friendly compound [1, 2, 3]. Carbon dots (CDs) are zero-dimensional carbon nanomaterials smaller than 10 nm. Due to their unique size [4], chemical and physical properties, water solubility, low production cost, and high photo-stability, carbon dots have received much attention for biomedical applications. Several approaches and materials have been used to prepare CDs with a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency [5]. These approaches are top-down or bottom-up [6] and include laser ablation [7], acidic oxidation [8], pyrolysis [9], hydrothermal treatments [10, 11], and microwave synthesis [12]. In addition, different materials including chemical and natural products [13] and raw materials such as glycerol, graphite oxide, and citric acid are used to fabricate CDs [14, 15]. Most of the reported research with simple pyrolysis or carbonization of small molecules involved synthesis of high performance CDs as imaging agents. Generally, these methods are economical, simple, and scalable [16]. Carbonization or pyrolysis methods were exploited to fabricate multicolor CDs (blue, green, yellow, and red). CDs have found applications in a various areas including biological sensing [17], bioimaging [18, 19, 20, 21], drug delivery, and photovoltaic devices, although several issues such as time-consuming and tedious synthesis and need for expensive instruments in the production processes remain [22, 23, 24, 25]. Thus, low-cost, rapid, and reliable synthesis of high quality and low cytotoxic CDs in large scales is still highly desirable [26]. Pyrolysis of citric acid, which is a facile bottom-up technique, is a potential approach to address this need [27].",

CDs hold the promise as potentially safe vehicles for biological applications due to their biocompatibility and low toxicity [29, 30]. CDs mainly enter cells via endocytosis and highly concentrate in the cytoplasm, although low amounts of CDs in the nucleus have also been reported [31]. CDs were successfully used for in vitro imaging of cell transfection and cytotoxicity [32, 33]. CDs with ultra-small size of less than 10 nm are more desirable as drug carriers and for imaging of living cells due to their ability to readily cross the cell membrane [29, 30].",

Samples were assigned to four groups based on the temperature and incubation time, i.e., 220-20, 200-30, 180- 40, and 160-50, where the first number in each pair shows temperature in degrees Celsius and the second number shows incubation time in minutes. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to measure CDs particle size. Zeta potential of the CDs was determined using ZEN 3600 (Malvern Instruments Co., USA) for different formation samples. The identification of functional groups was done using a Bruker, Tensor27, FT-IR. To confirm morphological characteristics of the particles, scanning transmission electron microscopy (Tecani\u2122 G2 F20, FEI Company) was used at 200 kV.",

Therefore, we synthesized CDs under four different temperature-time conditions: 220-20, 200-30, 180-40, and 160-50. The CDs after neutralization are shown under visible light and UV irradiation in Figure 2a. We determined the QY of all four samples. The 160-50 sample displayed a strong fluorescence with QY of 29.4% when exposed to UV light at 365 nm (Figure 2b). This QY is significantly higher than that from a previous reports, i.e., ~4\u201310% [36]. Our measurements showed that the 160-50 sample also had the highest photoluminescent emission (Figure 3a). Furthermore, according to Figure 3b, the emission peaks of the synthesized CDs showed no significant shift at different excitation wavelengths. The highest emission intensity was observed at 350 and 375 nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra in Figure 3c indicated absorption of stretching vibration O\u2013H, C\u2013H, and C\u2013OH groups [35]. To determine the size distribution of CDs dynamic light scattering (DLS) was employed [37, 38, 39, 40]. The result showed that CDs were under 5 nm in diameter (Figure 3d), in agreement with previous reports that showed the size distribution of carbon dots was under 10nm [41, 42]. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analysis (Figure 3e) confirms that these monodisperse nanoparticles are mostly spherical and lattice finger with the d-spacing of 0.12 corresponding to the (102) lattice space of graphitic carbon [43].",

Consistent with the cell viability study, the 160-50 CDs resulted in a significant membrane damage at concentrations of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/ml, whereas the other three formations compromised membrane integrity only at 2.0 mg/ml (p \u2264 0.001).

Therefore, even at high concentrations, these CDs exhibited little toxicity toward cells compared to other reports [45, 46]. Greater toxicity of the 160-50 sample than the other three formations is most likely due to its significantly larger zeta potential [47, 48], indicating uptake of the 160-50 CDs by SKBR3 and MCF-12A cells than the other formations.",

Here, T_i and C_j are respectively the effects of the ith level of time on the observed value of survival rate. Note that there are four levels of time, i.e., 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, and six levels of concentration, i.e., 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mg/ml. In this model, (TC)_{i,j} is the joint effect of variable time and concentration on the response variable, V. Only for the sake of completeness, we consider a possible interaction effect between time and concentration on the rate of survival at the first step. In this model, \u03b5 represents the random error of each experiment, which is a Gaussian white noise. Under some mild assumptions on the \u03b5, firstly this model as a simple ANOVA allows us to test whether the two factors (time and concentration) do significantly affect the rate of survival of cells in our experiments. If so, the post-hoc test of this ANOVA model returns the importance level of each factor on the response variable V. It is worth mentioning that \u03bc is the global mean of survival rate of cells irrespective of time and concentration. As we expected, the ANOVA test indicated that there was no significant evidence to support an interaction effect between time and concentration, i.e.,H0:(TC)i,j=0 . Furthermore, increasing irradiation time from 1 h to 4 h showed a noticeable difference in viability of cells (Figure 8). These results suggest that the CDs upon irradiation significantly increased cytotoxicity compare to the vehicle control (P \u2264 0.001).",

We synthesized carbon dots (CDs) through thermal decomposition of citric acid at different temperatures and time durations and characterized their size, surface charge, quantum yield, and toxicity to cells. The CDs were smaller than 5 nm with a negative surface charge and showed a significantly higher quantum yield than those reported previously, especially with the CDs fabricated at 160 \u00b0C for 50 min (160-50 formation). Our analysis of cytotoxicity and photo-induced toxicity of CDs demonstrated their biocompatibility. Except for the 160-50 formation sample that showed a toxicity of ~20\u201330% to breast cell lines at the highest two concentrations used, other formation samples were non-toxic. Our results demonstrated that this effect was independent of cellular uptake of CDs as endocytosis of all four formation samples was similar. Overall, this study demonstrated that small changes in the synthesis conditions can have significant effects on properties of CDs. Our findings may facilitate the development of safe and biocompatible CDs for imaging and drug delivery systems.",
