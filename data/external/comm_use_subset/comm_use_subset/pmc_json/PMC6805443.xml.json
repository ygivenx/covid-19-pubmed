We previously demonstrated that the wild-type (wt) BV Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) or BV-infected dendritic cells (DCs) exert natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cell-dependent antimetastatic effects on mice, but they are CD4+ T cell independent [4\u20137]. These antimetastatic effects involve BV directly activating NK cells by inducing the upregulation of NK cell effector function against the tumor in a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-dependent manner [8]. Additionally, BV has been shown to suppress liver injury and fibrosis in vivo through the induction of interferon (IFN) [9]. Molinari et al. [10] also reported that BV carrying ovalbumin (OVA) on the VP39 capsid protein induced antitumor immunity.",

Because FrC-OVA-BV (rBV) is specific to the MHC I pathway, we evaluated its OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 secretion in vivo. The OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing T-cells from splenocytes were analyzed using ELISPOT or CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 assays 35 days after the intramuscular injection of rBV, wtBV, FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS or PBS on days 0 and 21 in mice (Fig. 2a). As displayed in Fig. 2b, the restimulation of rBV-immunized spleen cells with the OVA peptide resulted in higher levels of OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 compared with those in cells treated with wtBV, FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS or PBS. In the rBV-immunized spleen cells treated with the control peptide HIV-1 Gag, the level of OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 was decreased to that observed in the wtBV control. On the other hand, as determined by the CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 assay, the rBV, wtBV and FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS groups showed higher levels of CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 than the PBS control group (Fig. 2c and d). These results suggest that rBV is more efficient at activating the CD8+ T-cell-mediated response than wtBV or FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS groups.\n",

First, a classic prophylactic vaccination was examined. The experimental design is demonstrated in Fig. 3a. Mice were immunized with rBV, wtBV, FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS or PBS at 35 and 14 days prior to being inoculated with EG7-OVA cells. The growth of the tumors in the rBV group was inhibited compared with that observed in the PBS control group (no tumors developed), whereas the tumor growth in the wtBV or FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS groups did not differ from that in the controls until day 9, but inhibition was noted thereafter (Fig. 3b and c). To further determine the antitumor effects of rBV against EG7-OVA-induced growth, a therapeutic vaccination was performed (Fig. 4a). The survival rates of mice that were inoculated with EG7-OVA cells on day 0 followed by immunization with rBV, wtBV, FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS or PBS on days 14 and 21 were calculated. The survival times of the mice immunized with rBV were significantly longer than those of the mice inoculated with control wtBV or FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS (Fig. 4b). These results indicate that rBV-mediated protection against EG7-OVA-induced tumors may be a useful antitumor immunotherapy tool.\n\n",

            "text": "The viral vector vaccines established to date are human viral vectors that continue to give rise to problems associated with biosafety and toxicity. Furthermore, inactivated vaccine-mediated immunity is short-lived and predominantly humoral, with poor cell-mediated immunity. Among viral vectors, adenovirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV) have a much lower risk of insertional mutagenesis and have been tested for oncolytic virotherapy [19\u201321]. Adenoviral vectors will elicit antiviral immune responses following the first administration with a large dose of the vector because the virus is highly immunogenic [19\u201323]. This reaction might preclude further use of vectors or make subsequent use less effective. Recently, certain nonhuman viral vectors, including BV, have been explored as gene therapy vectors. Previous studies focused on the use of BVs as vaccines in gene therapy, as BVs do not replicate in mammalian cells and have low cytotoxicity and favorable biosafety features [24\u201328]. Kim et al. used BV as a delivery system to introduce telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) as a potential tumor-associated antigen for cancer immunotherapy [29]. In immunocompetent mice, BV-TERT induced IFN-\u03b3 T cells specific for TERT and NK cell activity in mouse splenocytes [29]. Since surface modification of the BV envelope by the vesicular stomatitis G (VSV-G) membrane protein improves BV transduction in vitro or in vivo, the display of the VSV G protein (VSVG) and heterologous peptide/protein via the GP64 anchor are the most widely adopted methods for enhancing the in vitro and in vivo gene transduction efficiency of recombinant baculoviruses [30\u201336]. Using this method, LyP-1, F3, and CGKRK tumor-homing peptides were originally identified by the in vivo screening of phage display libraries [37]. The fusion proteins were successfully incorporated into budded virions, which showed binding abilities to human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-435) and hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells that were improved two- to fivefold. These fusion proteins inhibited virus biding and transduction by free soluble peptides. The soluble Lyp-1 peptide induces death in cultured cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in mice implanted with xenograft tumors. The authors described that a BV expressing LyP-1 exerted an effect similar to that of soluble LyP-1 [38]. In addition to allowing efficient BV transduction, wtBV has been shown to immunostimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, including INFs, TNF-\u03b1, IL1A, IL1B and IL6 in mammalian cells and confer protection from lethal virus infection in mice [39, 40]. Abe et al. reported that wtBV activates proinflammatory cytokines in peritoneal macrophage cells, splenic CD11c+ DCs, and a murine macrophage cell line through the TLR9/MyD88 pathway in which the BV genome induces the innate immune response [41]. Subsequently, our previous studies demonstrated that BV induces the functional maturation of human monocyte-derived DCs (HCDs) and the activation of human NK cells via BV-HCDs [6, 7]. Furthermore, we showed that BV directly actives NK cells via TLR9 [8]. BV-DCs might therefore be a useful immunotherapy tool for viral infections and malignancies, particularly if used in association with current virotherapies to achieve the most effective results. The host innate and acquired or adaptive immunity were also strongly induced by the rBV vectors.",

IFN-\u03b3 release ELISPOT or CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 assays were used (Fig. 2a-d). In response to the OVA peptide, rBV exhibited significantly higher OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 levels than wtBV or FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS groups. However, compared with that in the rBV-immunized spleen cells that were restimulated with the control HIV-1 gag peptide, the level of OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 production was reduced to the level observed in the wtBV control. On the other hand, in the CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 assay, the rBV, wtBV, and FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS groups displayed higher levels of CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 than the PBS control group. In the present study, the question of whether rBV can induce the effects of antitumor immunity against EG7-OVA cells in mice was addressed. Classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations were examined. These vaccinations resulted in the inhibition of tumor growth and an increased survival time in response to inoculation with rBV (Figs. 3b and c, and 4b). These results indicate that the antitumor effects of rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors are mediated by a specific anti-FrC-OVA immune response.",

Furthermore, baculovirus has several attractive advantages, such as its good biosafety, large capacity for foreign genes, and better posttranslational modifications than those of other gene delivery vehicles.

Six-week-old B6 mice were vaccinated with FrC-OVA-pVAX1-GAG-MCS, wtBV, rBV or PBS on days 0 and 21 with the same vaccine via intramuscular injection. On day 35, the mice were sacrificed, and their spleens were isolated. b The IFN-\u03b3 contents in the supernatants of spleen cells from immunized mice were determined using IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT analysis. Spleen cells were recovered and cultured for 24 h in the presence of OVA or HIV-1 Gag proteins. As a control, unstimulated spleen cells were cultured. c Intracellular staining of IFN-\u03b3 in splenocytes immunized with FrC-OVA-pVAX1-GAG-MCS, wtBV, rBV or PBS as indicated above. The spleen cells were incubated with the OVA peptide and brefeldin A for 4 h. The intracellular production of IFN-\u03b3 in the population of CD8+ T cells was then analyzed by flow cytometry. d Percentage of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8+ T cells.
