Lactobacilli are an attractive vaccine vehicle because they persist in the gastrointestinal tract, adhere to epithelial cells, and modulate the immune response through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (reviewed in [7\u201310]). Lactobacilli are generally regarded as safe by the United States Food and Drug Administration and thus have a significant advantage over pathogen-based platforms.

To that end, we investigated the immunomodulatory capabilities of L. gasseri, L. acidophilus (strain NCFM), and NCFM mutant strains. We employed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from wild-type and specific PRR-deficient mice to examine the role of TLR2, NOD2, and caspase-1 stimulation on macrophage activation and cytokine production. In a novel observation, we reveal NOD2 signaling is essential for antigen-specific mucosal IgA responses in vivo.",

HEK-Blue hNOD2 cells were seeded at 7.5 \u00d7 104 cells per well and transfected with the lactobacilli digest products in triplicate (final volume of 200.1 \u03bcL) in a 96-well format. Positive control L18-MDP (200 ng/mL, InvivoGen) and negative controls of sterile water and Pam2CSK4 (100 ng/mL, InvivoGen) were treated similarly. Activation of hNOD2 was assessed through NF\u03baB/AP-1 activation of the stably transfected secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter after 44\u201348 hours of co-culture. SEAP concentration in the cell supernatants was evaluated using the chemiluminescent SEAP Reporter Gene Assay (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Sample means were calculated and expressed as fold difference over the sterile water control.",

At sacrifice, spleen, intestine, female reproductive tract (FRT), mesenteric lymph node (MLN), Peyer\u2019s patches (PP), and cecal contents were also harvested [6]. The vaginal vault was lavaged with 100 \u03bcl of PBS and the insoluble debris removed via centrifugation. Fecal pellets were suspended at 100 mg/mL in PBS with 10% goat serum, 2X proteaseArrest (G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO) and 0.1% Kathon, homogenized (FastPrep-24, MP Bio 4.0 m/s for 20 s for three cycles), and supernatant collected post-centrifugation. Cecal contents were processed by the same method as fecal pellets, but without proteaseArrest. Blood was periodically collected from tail vein or terminally via cardiac puncture. All samples were aliquoted and stored at\u2013 80 \u00b0C until analysis. Single cell suspensions of lymphocytes were isolated from the MLN, PP, spleen, colon, and FRT for ELISpot and B cell phenotyping. MLN were pushed through a 40 \u03bcm cell strainer with a syringe plunger. PP and spleen were dissociated in 5 mL cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) medium using the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi setting m_spleen_01_01), followed by incubation in ACK (ammonium chloride potassium) buffer to lyse red blood cells in the spleen samples [26]. Colon and FRT were manually cleaned of mucus and debris in PBS, 1mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM EDTA, cut into ~1cm pieces, and digested with Liberase TM (125 \u03bcg/mL; Roche Molecular) and DNAse I (grade II 100 \u03bcg/mL; Roche Molecular) in digestion base media (RPMI containing 5 \u03bcg/mL gentamicin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 or 60 minutes, respectively, with constant tissue rotation at 37 \u00b0C. Tissue was mechanically disrupted prior to and after enzymatic digestion using the gentleMACS dissociator (Program B and m_liver_02). Post-digestion, tissue was passed through a 70 \u03bcm filter; lymphocytes were isolated using a Percoll gradient and suspended in CTL media as described previously [16]. After dissociation, all cells were washed with CTL media then passed through a 40 \u03bcm strainer. Small intestine ex vivo culture was performed as previously described to assess tissue cytokine production [31, 32]. Briefly, small intestine was opened longitudinally, irrigated with PBS, and shaken for 30 minutes at 240 rpm, room temperature (RT), in digestion base media. Tissue was subsequently blotted, weighed, diced, and distributed into a 24-well plate (0.05 g/well) with 150 \u03bcl CTL media. After 24 h incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2, supernatants were harvested and stored at\u201480 \u00b0C until analyzed in cytokine assays.",

However, as the differences between NCFM and NCK2025 and NCK2031 were considered a priori, no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. In order to satisfy the assumptions for analysis of variance (ANOVA), flow cytometric data expressed as a percentage were transformed using arcsine of the square root; a log10 transformation was used for flow cytometric MFI data along with cytokine data. In order to perform statistics on cytokine concentrations that were below the assay lower limit of detection (LLOD), values were assigned that were half of the LLOD [34]. If more than half of the cytokine responses were below the LLOD, the treatment or mouse-type was excluded from the analysis; thus, 5 cytokines were excluded from the analysis (GM-CSF, IL-12 (p70), IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, and IL-4).",

Ordinarily, lactobacilli taken up by macrophages are exposed to hydrolytic enzymes in the phagolysosome that digest PGN into constitutive components, including MDP. To demonstrate the ability of MDP from different lactobacilli to activate NOD2, we exposed HEK293 cells stably transfected with human NOD2 linked to a secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene to lysozyme-digested lactobacilli. Despite strain-dependent variability in the susceptibility of bacteria to lysozyme digestion, the soluble and insoluble fractions of each lactobacilli species, strain, and mutant strongly activated NOD2 (Fig 1) to a degree not significantly different from the positive control (NOD2 ligand, L18-MDP).",

Since Nod2 was required for NCFM immune activation of macrophages, we sought to determine whether our NCFM-derived oral immunization strategy expressing an HIV-1 model antigen (Gag) was dependent on NOD2 signaling in vivo [6, 20]. WT Nod2+/+ and Nod2-/- C57BL/6 mice were immunized with buffer alone, NCK1895, or NCK2166 by oral gavage (Table 1). Lymphocytes were collected at sacrifice from the FRT, large intestine (LI), PP, MLN, and spleen for flow cytometric phenotyping and determination of IgA secretion via ELISpot. While the percentage of CD45+CD19+CD38- B cells was significantly larger for NCK2166-immunized WT mice than for NCK2166-immunized Nod2-/- mice for most mucosal and systemic tissues (P < 0.05), this did not correspond with differences in IgA-producing cells as measured via ELISpot (Fig 5a and 5b). To determine whether NOD2 status dictated differential antigen-specific IgA levels, cecal contents and vaginal lavage samples were collected from mice at sacrifice and mucosal anti-Gag IgA was measured by ELISA. Gag-specific IgA levels in cecal contents were not statistically significantly different between NCK2166-immunized Nod+/+ and Nod-/- mice (Fig 5c). After immunization with NCK2166, only 2 of 6 Nod2-/- mice and no Nod2+/+ mice were positive for antigen-specific IgA in cecal contents (Fig 5c). No mice were positive for antigen-specific IgA in vaginal washes. Conversely, Gag-specific IgG levels in sera were statistically significant, with antigen-specific serum IgG detected in 5 of 6 WT mice compared to 0 of 6 Nod2-/- mice. Antibody responses to the highly expressed surface layer protein A (SlpA) of L. acidophilus can serve as an endogenous bacterial antigen for comparison against recombinant antigen responses. We found no correlation between anti-SlpA IgA or IgG seroconversion and HIV-specific antibody responses in C57BL/6 mice (Fig 5d).",

We conclude that NCK1785 and NCFM lead to the generation of a type II M2 (M2b)-like macrophage in vitro, a response dependent on expression of LTA and surface layer proteins in NCFM. We demonstrated the NOD2 stimulating capacity of MDP from lactobacilli strains NCK1785 and NCFM, adding to the previously described PRR stimulation profile, and found Nod2-/- macrophages were fundamentally impaired in their response to lactobacilli [16, 35]. Furthermore, robust mucosal and systemic antigen-specific humoral responses of mice mucosally immunized with a L. acidophilus NCFM-based vaccine expressing cell surface HIV-Gag or HIV-MPER was dependent on NOD2 signaling [6, 20].",

Here, despite similar M2b traits, the cytokine profile associated with NCFM was biased toward higher IL-10 and IL-12 (p40), and lower KC than NCK1785. In agreement with previous reports, we show that NCFM LTA has an inflammatory effect since NCK2025, which lacks LTA, is associated with increased IL-10, decreased IL-12 (p40), and decreased CD11b and MHCII expression by macrophages in vitro [23, 24, 48]. Interestingly, TLR2 itself was required for maximal IL-10 production in response to lactobacilli, suggesting that the LTA-TLR2-IL10 axis is complicated by additional PRR ligands or perhaps TLR2 co-receptors [13, 49]. The SlpB/X deficient mutant, NCK2031, had an anti-inflammatory effect on BMDM, with decreased MHCII, IL-6, and MIP-1\u03b1 compared to wild type NCFM. This is discrepant from previous reports of NCK2031 and is most likely due to the cell type evaluated and culture conditions employed [11, 24, 45]. The immunomodulatory properties of S-layer proteins from different lactobacilli species and strains must be further investigated.",

We found differential susceptibility of NCK1785 and NCFM to lysozyme degradation, but this did not correlate with NOD2 activation or macrophage cytokine production. Phagocytosis and NOD2 signaling did correlate with maximal MHCII and CD11b co-expression for NCK1785 and NCFM. NOD2 activation was essential for cytokine responses and acted synergistically with TLR2 rather than as a negative regulator thereof [15, 51, 52].",

Consistent with other reports, we observed that robust antigen-specific humoral responses against our NCFM-based mucosal vaccines required NOD2 signaling in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice [51, 53\u201355]. No specific vaccine correlates were identified here, but the significant increase of gut IL-1\u03b2 in NCK2166 immunized C57BL/6 mice was also dependent on NOD2. NOD2 and caspase-1 inflammasome activation were also required for lactobacilli induced IL-1\u03b2 in BMDM. Caspase-1 inflammasome activation can result in adjuvant-associated, highly inflammatory pyroptosis; however, lactobacilli BMDM activation occurred in a pyroptosis-independent manner [56, 57]. While NOD2 is involved in both NALP1 and NALP3 inflammasome activation, future studies are required to define the constituents of the inflammasome in this setting and the implications of limited pyropotosis for vaccine adjuvancy [18, 58, 59].",

Recent studies have demonstrated synergy between NOD2 and TLR2 in the development of antigen-specific humoral responses [51, 54]. While TLR2 has been shown to promote IgA class switching and plasma cell differentiation, Kim et al demonstrated the requirement of NOD2 for optimal humoral responses in a mucosal cholera toxin (CT) model [60, 61]. In their studies, the adjuvant effect of CT was promoted by microbiota-driven NOD2 signaling in CD11c+ phagocytes and implicated NOD2 in follicular helper T cells and plasma cell development [61]. Other studies have shown NOD2 expression by hematopoietic cells, in general, and B lymphocytes in particular, is required for optimal antibody responses [62\u201365]. NOD2 signaling by the microbiota appears necessary for the continuous diversification of memory B cells [65, 66]. NOD2 activation in the stromal compartment of the intestinal tract may also shape the antibody response [55]. Additional studies will be required to determine the specific cell types responsible for the NOD2-dependent humoral responses identified here.",

Data are represented as absorbance (mean with SEM) across time at 1:100 dilution for MPER-specific and 1:1000 for SlpA-specific serum and 1:10 for vaginal wash and feces. Average control values at the same dilution are represented as open circle or square. Seroconversion of immunized animals was defined as absorbance 3-fold greater than the average absorbance from control animals, and the number of GAD31 immunized animals that met this criterion is shown in parentheses; N = 6\u201312 animals per group (c). The same criterion was used for endpoint titer data, with values under detection limit assigned 0; N = 12 animals per group (d and e). (f) Lymphocytes isolated at sacrifice from PP, LI, FRT, and spleen were stained for flow cytometry or incubated in duplicate with or without HIV MPER for IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay. Spots were counted after 2 nights of incubation and data (mean with SEM) represented as the difference of SFU from HIV MPER stimulated and unstimulated cells per 1 \u00d7 106 live, CD45+ cells; N = 4\u20136 animals per group. Asterisk (*) indicates significance (P < 0.05) of difference between treatment group and buffer-only group of the same Nod2 genotype status; (***), between treatment group and Nod2-/- mice receiving same treatment.",
