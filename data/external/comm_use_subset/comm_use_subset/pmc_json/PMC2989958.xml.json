            "text": "DC-SIGN (Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin), encoded by CD209 on chromosome 19p13.3, is a C-type lectin that is expressed on subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) and alveolar macrophages [12-15], and functions both as a cell adhesion receptor and as a pathogen recognition receptor [16]. Acting as a pathogen uptake receptor, DC-SIGN could mediate interactions with a plethora of pathogens [17] including bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori [18]; viruses such as HIV-1 [19], Ebola [20,21], Cytomegalovirus [22], Hepatitis-C virus [23,24], Dengue virus [20,21,25], and SARS-coV [26], and parasites such as Leishmania pifanoi [27]. Several studies have recently reported on the role of DC-SIGN promoter variants in the susceptibility to or pathogenesis of various infectious diseases, such as dengue fever [25,28], tuberculosis [13,14,29,30], Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [19,31-33], celiac disease [34]. Sakuntabhai et al. [25] reported that the G allele of the variant DC-SIGN -336 was associated with strong protection against dengue fever [35]. In addition, several previous reports suggested that variants in the DC-SIGN promoter conferred protection against tuberculosis [29,30]. However, whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to NPC is still unknown and so far no study has reported on the variants in the DC-SIGN promoter in Cantonese population.",

In addition, Kashima et al. [37] found that the allelic frequency of DC-SIGN -332 A was 10.7% by sequencing 28 Asians; however, this SNP was neither detected by Barreiro et al. in Asians [30] nor by Koizumi et al. in Japanese individuals [31]. Equally, this SNP is not detected in individuals of Cantonese in current study, which indicates that DC-SIGN -332 A is not widespread in most Asians. Two other SNPs in the promoter region, DC-SIGN -745 G/T and -201 G/T, were not present in current cohort, though they were observed exclusively in the Zimbabwean population [38]. The allelic distribution of DC-SIGN genes differs widely in populations from different ethnic groups, presumably the result of selective pressure exerted by prevalent pathogens in these geographically distinct regions. NPC is rare in most populations around the world but common in China and Southeast Asia and this could be reflected in SNP frequencies. DC-SIGN, a protein expressed on the surface of DCs, has recently received considerable attention in research on AIDS [33], dengue [25,35], tuberculosis [29,30] and Ulcerative Colitis [39]. Previous studies have indicated that DC-SIGN -336 G is associated with protection against dengue disease in Thailand population [25] and tuberculosis disease in sub-Saharan Africa individuals [29]. It may mainly due to the location of the DC-SIGN -336 SNP 214 bp upstream of the major transcription site, affecting a Sp1-like binding site and further modulating DC-SIGN transcriptional activity [25]. However, Barreiro and colleagues [30] found that -336 A and -871 G variants conferred protection against tuberculosis in Eurasian populations. Meriem Ben-Ali et al. [40] found no association between DC-SIGN promoter variation and susceptibility to tuberculosis in Tunisian patients. These contrasting results may be due to significant differences in the distribution of DC-SIGN alleles in different ethnic populations [38]. Different population genetic backgrounds as well as differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns can be at the basis of the conflicting results. In current study, there was no observable association between DC-SIGN -336 SNP and NPC susceptibility in the Cantonese population.",

            "text": "The mechanism of involvement of mutant DC-SIGN -139 and 939 in the pathogenesis of NPC remains unknown. Previous studies have already demonstrated a higher frequency of allele DC-SIGN -139 A in individuals not infected with HIV compared with infected patients [32]. In another study, allele -139 G was found to be associated with the rapid progression of AIDS in a population of Japanese haemophiliacs [31]. In current study, we found that the frequencies of DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA were significantly higher in NPC patients compared with healthy controls. One potential mechanism for this effect may involve differential inducible expression of DC-SIGN on blood DCs as a result of these two polymorphisms, but this remains to be demonstrated. DC-SIGN -139 is located close to one of the binding sites of the transcription factor AP-1 in the promoter region of DC-SIGN, and we could speculate that the substitution of one nucleotide close to this site may change the level of expression of DC-SIGN and further contribute to the progression of NPC. As for DC-SIGN -939, it is yet to be determined whether this variant will affect the expression of DC-SIGN.",

            "text": "EBV is an important etiological agent of NPC and establishes persistent infections by employing multiple strategies to evade host immune responses. Consistent with the critical function of DCs in anti-viral immunity, myriad viruses are known to infect different subsets of DCs and to affect their differentiation, survival, and migration and/or T cell stimulatory capacity [41-44]. However, no studies have been performed so far to determine whether DC-SIGN is the EBV receptor. EBV has been observed to infect DC-SIGN positive cells such as immature DCs [45], monocytes [46-48] and some macrophages [49-51]. Furthermore, Li et al. [45]showed that EBV infection inhibited DC development from monocyte precursors, and further showed that immature DCs that become resistant to EBV-induced apoptosis still support virus entry [50]. Guerreiro-Cacais AO et al reported that EBV-infected macrophages could facilitate dissemination of EBV within the oral mucosal epithelium [50]. Recently, DC-SIGN could serve as putative receptor for secretory IgA (SIgA) on immature DCs by binding to high mannose glycoprotein on SIgA protein has been reported [52]. Sixbey JW et al have demonstrated that EBV-SIgA complex promoted EBV infection of epithelial cells through secretory component-mediated IgA transport [53]. We hypothesize that DC-SIGN expressed on immature DCs may recognize EBV-SIgA complex though binding to SIgA and thus promote EBV infection of immature DCs. This link DC-SIGN to EBV infection of immature DCs was need further confirmed and the study is on the way in our Lab.",
