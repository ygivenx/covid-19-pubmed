            "text": "In infectious disease epidemiology, contact networks consist of individuals (nodes) with connections (edges) between them representing interactions that may lead to infection transmission\n1. For respiratory and other infections that spread via close contact (such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) measles, meningitis, ebola, etc.), social contact networks can be used to highlight potential transmission routes\n2 and identify targeted intervention strategies through predictive mathematical models. Questionnaire surveys have been conventionally used to collect data on contact patterns\n3\u2013\n6 and networks\n7\u2013\n10, with increasing focus on studies in resource poor settings where disease burden is high\n11\u2013\n14. Despite providing invaluable \u201cwho-contacts-whom\u201d data that can be incorporated into models of infection transmission and control\n4,\n6,\n15,\n16, the questionnaire method suffers several setbacks, key being recall bias and low participation rates\n6,\n14,\n17. It has been argued that current transmission dynamic models that omit important factors such as frequency, duration and location of contacts do not adequately capture the heterogeneity of transmission that has direct bearing on intervention measures\n18\u2013\n20. Methods have been advanced to overcome these limitations of diary data, in particular automated data collection methods. These include wireless sensors embedded in portable devices such as mobile phones and customized wearable sensors that use Bluetooth and WiFi\n21,\n22, or low power radio frequencies\n23\u2013\n25, to determine proximity and co-location of users.",

The sensor platform in these studies has been designed to collect proximity data only from individuals facing each other while wearing the sensors, representing conversations or actual physical touch that can lead to infection transmission (\nwww.sociopatterns.org). The majority of studies using this platform reported a high participation rate (\u226575%), suggesting that an unobtrusive way of data collection requiring minimal participant intervention elicits better response rates compared to paper diaries\n14, especially in settings with a high proportion of illiterate individuals\n26. Saturation of study populations to define full networks rapidly encounters boundaries due to logistic, time and cost constraints. However, methods have been developed to effectively impute missing data by generating synthetic networks structure given the underlying properties and also the demographic characteristics of the study population\n37. Most importantly, sensors provide a rich temporal data source, even for partial networks, that can be used to investigate plausible characteristics of infection spread on networks structures weighted by frequency and duration of contacts.",

            "text": "A feasibility study on acceptability and utility of using sensors within five households was conducted in Kilifi over three days of the week\n26. This pioneer study in Africa revealed three key points, particularly relevant to the design of similar studies in resource poor settings. First, individuals were willing to carry the sensors for extended periods of time because they were unobtrusive and did not require user or investigator intervention to collect data. However, the sensors were considered too big to be used on infants. Second, results suggested children spent more time in contact with other children at the household compared to other age groups, while adults appeared to act as bridges between households. Third, within household temporal contact patterns per day were stable across three days of observation, and contacts between individuals of different households were erratic. Residents aged \u226515 years were under-represented due to being away at school or work. This pilot study recommended elaborate community engagement strategies to ensure wider acceptance of study procedures, and proper training of participants on sensor use and storage (e.g. store them separately when sleeping). Current sensors being deployed in recent studies, such as by Ozella\net al.\n27 are smaller, lighter, round in shape and with an on-board flash memory that can store data over longer periods of time. These properties have made the sensors more suitable for use in larger population-based studies, suggesting that they can be deployed in more hard-to-reach populations particularly infants who bear the biggest brunt of respiratory infections.",

            "text": "Schools and households are locations where a high proportion of a population will spend most of their time and individual interactions are frequent and intense\n4,\n6,\n11,\n13, potentially leading to a high propensity to spreading of respiratory infections\n38\u2013\n40. These intense interactions are poorly understood, particularly in the very young infants. Studies have revealed the role of older siblings, mothers and other household members on the transmission of respiratory infections to infants. School-going children are notable introducers and transmitters of respiratory infections to same-household members\n41\u2013\n43 and to members of other households\n44. Infants too spend more time with their mothers compared to other household members\n27,\n45,\n46, also suggesting the key role that mothers may have to play in the transmission of infection. In addition, other studies revealed that interactions between infants and non-household members were non-negligible but rarely captured\n45, suggesting that targeting same-household members only to cocoon infants from infections may have a limited impact on transmission\n45,\n46. Measures such as school closure have been shown to be effective in reducing the magnitude of outbreaks by infections that spread via close contacts (e.g. influenza)\n39,\n47, largely dependent on the transmissibility of the virus and the type of school closure (e.g. one class vs entire school\n42). As a side effect, school closure results in more age- and location-heterogeneous interactions, particularly with adults at home and with students from other schools\n48. This increases the potential for transmitting infections to students from other schools and to individuals of working ages, thus suggesting that additional interventions such as vaccinating students from neighbouring schools and adults may need to be considered. Larger studies that may capture contact events within and between households (and school settings) are suggested to provide empirical data that is needed in mathematical models that simulate transmission and assess the impact of various control measures.",

Background socio-demographic data for each individual will be extracted from the KHDSS database and updated manually in case some details are missing. Proximity data will be collected using wearable proximity sensors (\nFigure 3A), henceforth called sensors. The sensors have been developed by the SocioPatterns project (a European consortium of institutions and investigators focused on social dynamics,\nwww.sociopatterns.org). The sensors operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band of the RF spectrum. The total weight of the sensor inclusive of a lithium coin battery (CR2032) is <6 grams. Sensors exchange ultra-low-power radio packets in a peer-to-peer fashion by transmitting and scanning their neighbourhood for packets sent by nearby tags on a specific radio channel. Sensors in proximity exchange a maximum of 1 data packet per second and can store over 1,000 hours of continuous data collection in an on-board memory. This exchange of low-power radio packets is used as a proxy for the close co-location of individuals wearing the sensors. The proximity between individuals and temporal resolution are estimated from the power levels and timestamps contained in the data packets, respectively. To estimate how close individuals are, the attenuation of the signals with distance is computed as the difference between the received and transmitted power. Proximity between individuals corresponding to a face-to-face interaction, such as during a handshake, is asserted when the median attenuation over a given time interval exceeds a specified attenuation threshold (in dBm). All individuals will wear a sensor attached to a lanyard around the neck so that it rests on the chest area (\nFigure 3B) or pinned to the front of a blouse/shirt especially for younger children (\nFigure 3C). In this manner, only face-to-face proximity relations will be detected; moreover, the low-power radio frequency in use cannot propagate through the human body\n24.",

Heterogeneity of the contacts and their statistical distributions will be assessed across five key variables: age group (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201319, 20\u201349, >50 years), gender (female and male), temporality (hourly, daily and weekly), grade (kindergarten, grades 1\u20138), and setting (rural/urban). Analysis will be conducted using various Python 2.7 libraries (\nNumpy v1.12 and\nPandas v0.2) and custom and non-public data processing software by the SocioPatterns project (data cleaning and management), R 3.2.1 (statistical analysis and network visualization),\nGephi (network visualization) and\nQGIS (cartography). Network data analysis and visualization will be aggregated at the school and household level with nodes representing students and household residents, respectively. Links between two individuals\ni and\nj in contact will be weighted by the cumulative duration of interaction between them. Temporal data will be aggregated into time windows of 10 minutes, hourly, daily and over the entire duration of the study (7 days).",

To date, very few studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa to elucidate the mechanisms of spread. This study proposed to use wireless proximity sensors to collect data from students in schools and household residents in rural and urban areas of coastal Kenya. Schools and households have been identified as the hubs of transmission for respiratory infections such as RSV\n41,\n52,\n53 particularly due to prolonged and more intimate contacts at these settings. Results from this study will include the number and duration of contacts and how they vary by age, gender, day of the week, role, and location.

First, it is not possible to describe full social networks at participating school and households due to the limited number of sensors available. Nonetheless, this protocol will investigate contacts within schools and households, settings that are important for spread of respiratory infections. An attempt to minimize selection bias is through random selection of students in a school and linking the students to their entire households and neighbours. This study will also develop the body of knowledge on longitudinal patterns of social networks in rural and urban communities in a developing world setting. Due to the spatially restricted data collection sites, it will not be possible to generalize with certainty these results to other settings locally and globally because of differences in demography, social and cultural attributes. This suggests the need to collect additional national and regional studies, with the advantage that this study protocol can be adapted for use elsewhere since the sensors can be reused. In addition to reusability, the current sensors offer additional advantages when compared to a pilot study conducted in the same setting\n26: they are smaller and lighter, can be worn by people of all ages including infants, have a bigger memory and battery capacity meaning that data can be collected over longer periods. This may be effectively used to assess the effect of seasonality on changes in social contacts and disease transmission.",
