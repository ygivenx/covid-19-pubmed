IAVs are known to infect a wide range of avian and mammalian hosts, and it is highly likely that their host range could be broader than currently known, with more reservoirs to be revealed. For example, Northwest Atlantic gray seals have recently been suggested to be an endemically infected wild reservoir population for diverse IAVs4. From these natural reservoirs, IAVs can evolve into novel variants which can potentially lead to human pandemics. Influenza pandemics occur time to time with the most recent pandemic being in 2009. It is undisputed that the next influenza pandemic will happen, but the only question is when it will happen. Despite several reports investigating the basis of genetic variability of IAVs, the precise mechanism of pandemic IAV generation still remains an unresolved mystery. It is possible that additional IAV reservoirs are yet to be identified which will help to see the full picture of IAV ecology and evolution.",

Bats are globally distributed, relatively long lived5 and represent approximately 24% of all known mammalian species. Further, bats are one of the most diverse families of mammals found in nearly every habitat/continent around the world except Antarctica. More importantly, certain Old World bat species are known to be natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses that cause some of the deadliest diseases in humans including filoviruses (such as Ebola and Marburg viruses), lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses and henipaviruses (e.g. Hendra and Nipah viruses)6, 7. In addition, bats also act as a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses (hepatitis C virus and GB virus B)8. Notably, all the zoonotic viruses of bat-origin identified to date are RNA viruses5. However, it is believed that the actual diversity of viruses in bats could be much more than what is currently known, \ufeffas most of the\ufeff investigations have focused on searching for specific viruses of interest and many additional viruses must have been overlooked9.",

            "text": "The prospects for bats contributing to IAV epidemiology came to light after the identification of two novel influenza-like viruses in fruit bats by next generation sequencing10. These two viruses are genetically distinct from all previously known IAVs and hence are designated as novel subtypes, namely H17N10 and H18N11. These novel IAVs have been recently recovered in cell culture using synthetic DNA11. However, these HA and NA subtypes have not been identified in birds serologically or virologically. Consequently, the reservoir(s) of these novel IAV subtypes is still undefined. Phylogenetic studies raised a possibility that bats have the capacity to harbor more influenza virus genetic diversity than all the other mammalian and avian species combined10. In addition, it was demonstrated that little yellow-shouldered bats in Central America could constitute a potential sylvatic mammalian reservoir of influenza12. Susceptibility of bats to IAVs has been confirmed by recent serological evidence of AIV H9 subtype in about 30% of frugivorous bats from Africa13. It is worth noting that detection of antibodies against one AIV subtype in 30% of the bats tested is very significant.",

The expression of the appropriate host cell receptor to which viral haemagglutinin (HA) can bind is the key determinant of the ability of IAVs to infect a host15. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) preferentially bind to SA receptors that are linked to galactose by an \u03b1 2,3 linkage (SA \u03b12,3-Gal), while human and classical swine influenza viruses show preference to \u03b12,6 linked SAs (SA \u03b12,6-Gal). A key source of IAV genetic diversity could be from the replication of IAVs in a non-native host species that initiate evolution of new virus variants16. Hosts that co-express both SA \u03b12,3-Gal and SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptors such as chickens, ducks and pigs have been hypothesized to potentially support re-assortment of IAVs and hence play a major role in the evolution of IAVs14, 17.",

There is serological evidence of avian influenza virus infection in certain frugivorous bats13 and Pteropus alecto bat cells were found to be susceptible to IAV infection and reassortment19. In addition bats have been shown to harbor novel influenza-like viruses10. However, to date, the SA receptor distribution in any bat species is completely unknown. For the first time, this study demonstrated that little brown bats (LBBs), a widely-distributed bat species in North America, co-express both avian and human type influenza receptors in their respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.",

In contrast SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptors are predominant in the tracheal mucosal lining in chickens, pigs and humans14, 17. We found co-expression of both avian and human type receptors in the mucosal lining of stomach and to a lesser degree in intestines.

In contrast, other mammalian species such as humans and pigs predominantly express SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptors in the GI tract17. Unlike chickens and ducks, low levels of SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptor expression was also observed in LBB digestive tract which decreased progressively from stomach to intestines. We did not find any difference in the receptor distribution among various locations in intestines as it is difficult to distinguish large and small intestine in most bat species23. Similarly, no major differences in the receptor distribution pattern between large and small intestine were found in most other species including chickens, ducks and pigs14, 17. A fair amount of SA \u03b12,6-Gal receptor expression was found in the intestinal crypts, lamina propria, muscularis and serosa of LBB intestine. It is worth noting that a similar co-expression pattern of influenza receptors is observed in various wild birds of the families Columbiformes, Anseriformes and Gruiformes20, which constitute the natural influenza virus reservoir, and also in pigs17.

However, a recent study rescued these viruses using reverse genetics in cell culture and found that the novel bat influenza viruses can infect a range of mammalian cells including canine cells29. All the existing data suggests that bats could be susceptible to many different IAV subtypes and even support co-infection of avian and human IAVs. It is believed that the novel bat influenza viruses found in fruit bats are probably the ancient influenza viruses from which the modern world IAVs have been derived over time30. Evidence of high seroprevalence of avian influenza in frugivorous bats together with the evidence of abundant SA receptors in LBBs found in this study, raises a strong possibility that bats could be a major influenza virus reservoir.",

Settings of the confocal microscope were determined using negative controls to avoid any background fluorescence and the same settings were used to scan all the other sections for consistency. To rule out nonspecific binding of the lectins and IAVs, control tissue sections were treated, prior to lectin staining or virus binding, with Sialidase A (N-acetylneuraminate glycohydrolase; Prozyme, San Leandro, CA), for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, which cleaves all non-reducing terminal sialic acid residues in the order \u03b1(2,6) > \u03b1(2,3) > \u03b1(2,8) > \u03b1(2,9).
