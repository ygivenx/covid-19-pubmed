Several studies have assessed the utility of non-specific inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase reactant released in response to cytokine interleukin-6, white cell count (WCC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to discriminate probable bacterial infections from non-bacterial infections and also to assess the severity of illness [7, 8]. Bacterial pneumonia has been associated with higher CRP, WCC and ANC than viral pneumonia [8\u201311], while some studies have found no difference in biomarkers among bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia [12, 13]. Even studies that report differences in these biomarkers cannot determine any reliable thresholds for differentiating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia [10, 14]. Previous studies were also affected by small sample size, use of less sensitive methods for pathogen detection which could have resulted an inaccurate categorization of bacterial and viral cases [12, 14]. Furthermore, studies have been conducted in low-income settings where the contribution of bacterial infection may be higher and where children are at higher risk of other infectious diseases that could influence the biomarker levels and confound the analysis [10].",

However, the utility of inflammatory biomarkers in a highly-vaccinated paediatric population with pneumonia to differentiate bacterial from viral pneumonia has rarely been assessed [11]. We therefore assessed the distribution of inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, WCC and ANC) in blood samples from a prospective case-control study of Western Australian children with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia [17]. We compared the clinical characteristics and biomarkers level among pneumonia cases detected with bacteria and viruses. We assessed the cut-off threshold of these biomarkers for discriminating bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia.

The swab was tested for a total of 14 respiratory viruses: influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) type 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AV), rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV OC43, HCoV 229E, HCoV HKU1 and HCoV NL63) and 6 bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

In UK children, Elemraid et al. found a higher CRP, WCC and ANC in those with bacterial compared to viral pneumonia, with a CRP level > 80 mg/L reportedly distinguishing severe bacterial pneumonia from viral pneumonia [9]. The sensitivity and specificity for CRP > 80 mg/L for differentiating bacterial versus viral/atypical pneumonia in children with community-acquired pneumonia was 71 and 52%, respectively, in Norway [11] and was 52 and 72%, respectively, in Finland [14]. We found that CRP had better discriminatory utility (AUC > 0.8) than the WCC or ANC, consistent with findings similar settings [9, 11, 14]. The optimum CRP threshold for differentiating definite bacterial from presumed viral and other pneumonia had only moderate predictive value which could limit its use as a sole criterion for antibiotic decision-making in clinical settings. Serum procalcitonin is not routinely used in our study setting, so we could not assess its value for distinguishing bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral pneumonias. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been described as a better biomarker for bacterial sepsis than CRP [30], while other found serum CRP as better predictor for lobar consolidation and pleural effusion than PCT [31].",

To our knowledge, however, combining inflammatory biomarkers with clinical symptoms has rarely been explored.

Furthermore, purulent pleural effusions are generally considered to be of bacterial origin even if bacteria cannot be detected. Respiratory viruses are usually detectable in the nasopharynx of children with viral pneumonias, but may also be detectable in healthy children [16, 33, 34]. In the absence of any gold standard microbiological assays for distinguishing bacterial from viral and mixed infections, we categorised cases based on whether they were highly likely to be bacterial (definite), most likely viral (presumed), or possibly either based on whether bacteria were detected in sterile sites, respiratory viruses were detected in the nasopharynx, or neither. This pragmatic approach to classification reflects the limitations of current methods, and some misclassification is likely to have occurred. Previous studies categorised cases as either bacterial or viral, are were more limited due to lower pathogen detection rates and by the use of less sensitive assays [8, 9, 12, 14, 26]. The strength of this study is that the range of pathogens tested covered virtually all important bacteria and viruses associated with childhood pneumonia using sensitive molecular techniques.",

Of note, there were differences between presumed viral pneumonia and other pneumonia cases; the latter were less likely to have rhinorrhoea and tachypnoea suggesting they may comprise a higher proportion of bacterial infections than the presumed viral group. Half of all cases had prior exposure to antibiotics at enrolment which might have impacted on the natural progression of signs and symptoms and biomarkers, and the sensitivity of bacterial culture.
