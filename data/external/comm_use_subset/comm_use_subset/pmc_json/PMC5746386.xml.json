It belongs to the family Coronaviridae and ranges from 26 to 32 kb in length, making it the largest known RNA virus [2]. To date, six CoVs have been identified that infect humans, including Human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E), Human CoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Human CoV-NL63 (HCoV-NL63), Human CoV- HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) [3]. To date, WHO has reported 2081 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with MERS-CoV, including 722 deaths (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-CoV/en/), making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans. Previous studies indicated that MERS-CoV might have recombination events in different lineages [4]. Previous study also showed that the MERS-CoV species and HCoV-229E-related lineage co-circulated in Saudi Arabia, and they found a recombinant lineage of MERS-CoV that is endemic in camels [5]. The recombinant viruses led to an outbreak of MERS-CoV in humans in 2015 [6]. The evolution rate and recombination rate of coronavirus is increasing, such as MERS-CoV [4], therefore, it's significantly important to study the evolution and the influencing factors of MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Codon usage bias is an important indicator of genome evolution. There are several factors that might influence the codon usage bias, including natural selection, mutational pressure, G+C content, secondary protein structure and replication selective transcription [7, 8]. Codon usage is a driving force in the evolution of small DNA viruses and astroviruses [9]. Some studies showed that the codon usage bias of RNA viruses is low, such as in the Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) [10], Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) [11], the N gene of Rabies virus (RABV) [12] and Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [13]. A previous study indicated that different SARS-CoV genes had significant variation in their codon usage bias [14]; however, the bias is low. In contrast, Woo et al. demonstrated that CoV-HKU1 has a strong codon usage bias and a high NNU/NNC ratio of 8.835 [15]. They also showed that both cytosine deamination and selection of CpG-suppressed clones are the major factors that shape codon bias in CoV genomes [15]. Additionally, a previous study showed that the codon usage of HCoV-NL63 is characterised by a high U composition and a low G/C composition, which might reflect the evolutionary origin of the virus. They suggested that viruses acquire some functions from other recent viral or cellular origins by gene transfer [16]. During protein biosynthesis, synonymous codon encoded amino acids are not used randomly, and some species or genes always prefer to use of one or several particular synonymous codons, which was termed as codon usage bias. Previous studies revealed that different genes from different species or from the same species have obvious codon usage biases [14, 17]. In the present study, we first analysed the codon usage data of MERS-CoV strains. The codon usage information for the MERS-CoV strains might provide some clues to the characteristics of the MERS genome and the evolutionary history of the virus.",

            "text": "The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) value of each synonymous codon in the MERS-CoV genome was calculated (Table 2), which indicated that codon usage bias exists in the coding sequence of the MERS-CoV genome. Among codons encoding hydrophobic amino acids, CCG (proline, 868 times) and GUU (valine, 17588 times) were the least and most frequently used codons, respectively. Meanwhile, among the hydrophilic amino acids, the least and most frequently used codons were CGG (arginine, 1160 times) and GAU (aspartic acid, 14947 times), respectively. We also observed that there were no synonymous codons encoding an amino acid with the same RSCU value, which indicated that synonymous codons are not used equally in MERS-CoV human isolates. In addition, the 18 most frequently used codons for each amino acid ended in either U or A. Meanwhile, among the synonymous codons of the 18 amino acids, 15 codons ended with U and 3 ended with A, which further proved that the codon bias exists in the MERS-CoV human isolates. To estimate the degree of codon usage bias in the MERS-CoV human isolates genome, the effective number of codons (ENC) value of the 32 strains were calculated. The average ENC value was 49.816 \u00b1 0.08 which was high (>45) and indicated a lower codon usage bias existed in MERS-CoV. The relative abundance values of the 16 dinucleotides were then counted (Figure 1). We noted that most of the relative abundance values of the 16 dinucleotides were not in accordance with expected value (i.e. the relative abundance value=1). And 10 of the dinucleotides (AG, AC, UG, UC, GG, GC, CC, UA, GA and CG) have less than 1 relative abundance values, however, the other six dinucleotides (AA, AU, UU, CA, GU and CU) were larger than 1. This indicated that the codon usage pattern is not equal for these dinucleotides. Similarly, CpG had the lowest frequency, while UpU showed the highest frequency. Hence, this analysis suggested that the composition of the nucleic acids affected the codon usage pattern of MERS-COV.",

The ENC values of the coding regions of these strains were plotted against the GC3s (Figure 2). It's shown that the observed value was smaller than the expected value, which indicated that the codon usage bias patterns exist in these MERS-CoV strains. From the resultant Figure 2, the results showed that the ENC values of the 32 MERS-CoV human isolates and 24 MERS-CoV camel isolates were clustered together, with few changes between each other. This indicated that the ENC value of MERS-CoV human isolates or camel isolates changed little between different strains, which was in accordance with the small ENC SD value of these sequences. We also observed that the ENC values of bat and hedgehog CoV isolates show slightly higher dispersion levels compared with each other. However, most of the plots for bat CoV strains surrounded the MERS-CoV human and camel isolates and were not far from them; the plots for the hedgehog isolates were a little further from them. This analysis showed that the mutation pressure affects the codon usage bias of these strains. Besides mutational bias, there might be additional factors that drive the codon usage variation among these genes. It is generally recognized that factors such as mutational bias and natural selection pressure contribute to codon usage bias patterns [19\u201321]. Thus, to further investigate the possible influence of mutational pressure on the MERS-CoV strains codon usage bias patterns, correlation analysis was performed between the codon compositions (A3s, U3s, G3s, C3s, and GC3s), the ENC values and nucleotide compositions (A%, U%, G%, C%, and GC%) (Table 3). The results revealed that most of the codon compositions correlated with the nucleotide compositions. Among them, the U3s, A3s, G3s, GC3s correlated significantly with almost all the nucleotide compositions (A%, U%, G%, C%, and GC%), with P values less than 0.01. These results confirmed that the codon usage bias of the MERS-CoV strains (human/camel isolates) was influenced by the nucleotide compositions; thus by mutational bias.",

We then performed correlation analysis between the codon compositions, and the first axis value and the second axis value revealed these compositions were correlated or significantly correlated (Table 3), especially for the first axis. These observations reflected that: (1) there was little change in the codon usage bias between the MERS-CoV human isolates and the MERS-CoV camel isolates. This also proved that mutational bias contributed to the MERS-CoV codon usage bias. This was also in accordance with the SD values of the RSCU of the MERS human/camel isolates; (2) In addition to mutational pressure, there are other factors, such as natural selection, which might influence the codon bias of MERS-CoV of human/camel isolates; (3) CoV of Tylonyteris, Pipistrellus and Erinaceus europaeus have distinct codon usage patterns compared with the MERS-CoV human/ camel isolates: in the plots, the data points were closer to the axes than to the origin; (4) The codon usage bias patterns of Tylonyteris, Pipistrellus and Erinaceus europaeus CoV were not only caused by mutational bias, but also by natural selection pressure, which might have had a larger effect than mutational bias.",

The phylogenetic tree analysis which performed by the previous report method found that these 54 MERS-CoVs were divided into two clades, named Clade A and Clade B (Supplementary Figure 1), and the results are consistent with previous study [4]. In this analysis, the different open reading frames (ORFs) of the whole genome and different genes of MERS-CoV strains were used (Figure 4). For the M gene, the gene changes seemed to be random, which indicated that evolution had little effect on the M gene (Figure 4A). For the ORF1ab gene, there was a clear evolutionary trend over time, especially for the 2015 isolates of MERS-CoV (Figure 4C). For the N gene, mutation was the main influencing factor (Figure 4B). The result for the S gene was similar to the ORF1ab gene (Figure 4D): both evolution and mutation affected the codon usage pattern, with mutation having the larger effect. Obviously, the aggregation/dispersion states of the plots that were composed using different genes are different to the plots using the whole genome in Figure 4E.

            "text": "The genetic code is degenerate, as multiple codons code for a single amino acid. Most organisms exhibit differences in base composition and significant codon bias (unequal usage of synonymous codons). Generally, mutations leading to change in amino acids are studied as a measure of selection. Synonymous mutations can change the base composition of genes without altering the corresponding proteins. Intuitively, synonymous mutations appear to be \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cnear-neutral\u201d in their effects; however, their evolutionary consequences are being recognised increasingly [22\u201326]. Studies show that codon bias and synonymous mutations are under weak selection, driving evolution in various organisms [27\u201329]. Genes that are enriched for preferred codons are known to have higher translational efficiency. It has been shown in other host-pathogen systems, such as bacteria\u2013bacteriophages, that long-term co-evolution has resulted in some genes of bacteriophages being enriched in the codons preferred by their respective bacterial hosts [30]. A balance between selection, mutation and genetic drift maintains the codon bias in the host and the pathogens. Thus, studies revealing determinants of the bias and its dynamics are central to our understanding of host\u2013pathogen evolution [31, 32]. Previous studies has been revealed that compared with DNA viruses, the evolution of RNA viruses was faster, such as the evolution of influenza virus [33, 34], coronaviruses [4, 35]. Codon usage analysis is a serviceable and well-established method to study the codon usage patterns of different organisms, such as the studies of codon usage of VP2 gene of canine parvovirus [36], and the N gene of rabies viruses [12]. Recently, the high case\u2013fatality ratio of MERS-CoV infection has attracted considerable attention in the worldwide. Although the genome sequence of MERS-CoV has been published and many studies have been performed after each outbreak [4, 6, 37, 38], little genomic analysis was studied on this virus. To further understand the genomics of the MERS strains, we performed codon usage analysis of the MERS-CoV and its related strains. Investigating the extent and causes of codon usage bias is essential for research focused on viral evolution and transmission. To investigate the factors leading to the MERS-CoV and MERS related strains codon usage patterns, several analytical methods were used in our study. First, the RSCU value of the MERS strains were calculated. The results indicated that codon usage bias exists and that the MERS preferred codons almost all end in U, with a proportion of 15/18. The codon usage bias was further confirmed by the mean ENC value of 49.82. For comparison, the mean ENC value for other studied viruses were: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (mean ENC=47.91) [13], SARS (mean ENC = 48.99)[39], Foot and mouth disease virus (mean ENC = 51.42) [40], H5N1 influenza A virus (mean ENC = 50.91) [41], Duck enteritis virus (mean ENC = 52.17) [42], Classical swine fever virus (mean ENC = 51.7) [43] and Hepatitis A virus (mean ENC = 39.78)[44]. An ENC value greater than 45 is considered as a lower codon usage bias. The mean ENC value for MERS-CoV strains was a little higher than most viruses and was higher than 45; therefore, the codon usage bias of MERS is relatively low. The codon studies on coronavirus has been reported previously [39, 45], however, the ENC of MERS-CoV was higher than the SARS CoV, additionally, in this study, we discovered that other than mutation pressure, natural selection, as well as the abundance of dinucleotide, also contribute to the evolution of MERS-CoV. A low biased codon usage pattern might allow the virus make use of several codons for each amino acid, and might be beneficial for viral replication and translation in the host cells. The relative abundance of dinucleotides also correlated with the first two principal components in the PCA analysis. The result showed that there was an obvious distinction in the dinucleotide usage. CpG dinucleotides had the lowest abundance, which indicated that MERS-CoV might have the ability adapt to the host. When the ENC values were plotted against GC3s, the codon usage bias in MERS-CoV was identified. If the codons of MERS-CoV strains were completely random, with bias supplied in the standard curve, all of the data points would lie upon the expected curve. However, Figure 2 showed that the data points representing the ENC value for each MERS-CoV strain were lower than the expected curve. This indicated that there were codon usage bias in the codon usage pattern, and other factors influenced the MERS codon usage pattern. Additionally, in the ENC-plot analysis, it was discovered that bat CoV isolates show slightly higher dispersion levels, and near to the distribution of human related and camel related CoVs, which might due to the consequence of the bat was the natural host of coronavirus. Generally, the main causes of codon usage bias are considered to be mutational bias and natural selection pressure, which are the two main forces involved in shaping the synonymous codon usage pattern of RNA viruses. To confirm the possible role of mutational bias in the codon usage pattern, we performed correlation analysis between the nucleotide content and the codon composition. The strong correlation between these two variables (except in the C3s and A%, U%, G%, C%) showed that mutational bias contributed to the codon usage pattern. A significant correlation was shown between the GC3s values and the nucleotide content (Table 3), which also revealed the importance of mutational bias. The role of mutational bias was further demonstrated by the PCA analysis, which showed that the first and second components were significantly correlated with the nucleotide content. For the MERS human/camel isolates, a weak codon usage bias might be caused by natural selection when the viruses adapt to the host cells. In contrast, a strong bias caused by nature selection in the other CoV strains of MERS related isolates were also observed. With natural selection pressure, the rate of codon change might be slightly larger compared with the data whose plots are clustered close to the origin. To further determine the roles of mutation, natural selection and evolution in the MERS-CoV strains, CA was performed. CA indicated that both mutation and natural selection affect the codon usage pattern, with mutation having a more important role. This implied that there is some correlation between the different isolates. Next, we investigated the role of natural selection in shaping the MERS-CoV strains codon usage patterns by investigating the relationships between the Gravy value, the Aroma value and nucleotide content, and the high codon adaptation index (CAI) value compared with the host genome codon usage pattern. The results showed that mutation bias was more important than natural selection pressure in neutral analysis in MERS-CoV human/camel isolates, which agreed with the result of the PCA. In addition, gene function, the evolution factor and the different hosts were also identified as factors that are influential in shaping the MERS-CoV codon usage pattern, while the geographical distribution had no influence on the MERS-CoV codon usage bias.",

However, among the CoV isolates from bats or hedgehogs, the use of the same synonymous codons as their hosts was highly consistent. This may hint that coronavirus does not spread so widely in humans. In the evolutionary process, natural selection pressure plays an increasing role.

The first one is that cytosine (C) is the methylation signal and the methylation of C results in a decrease in the level transcription and an increase of the mutation frequency. Thus, for codons such as XCA, XCT/U, XCC and XCG, which encode the same amino acid, the nucleotide C with an A, U or C tag after is more favourable than G. The specific oligodeoxynucleotide of the core unmethylated CpG dinucleotides can also stimulate a host immune response to the exogenous DNA or biological. Reducing the CpG dinucleotide content of codons allows the virus to avoid stimulating the host immune system as far as possible, which is beneficial to the hosts in vivo survival [52]. A low frequency of the CpG dinucleotides also affects the viral codon usage pattern.",
