            "text": "Search engine data analysts (e.g., Google Flu Trends and other products of search engine query data) have made it convenient for us to track disease-related trends more effectively [1, 2]. However, their limitations have attracted increasing attention from the broader scientific community [3, 4]. The accuracy of disease tracking mechanisms that use search engine data is affected by Internet use trends, by external interferences from the media and from government policies, and by frequently updated algorithms created by search engine companies [1, 3, 4]. Such problems have manifested in Google Flu Trends, which missed the first wave of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and which overestimated peak flu levels during the 2012/2013 season [2, 4]. As a typical application of big data, search engine data have attracted considerable public attention. Despite these biases and problems, as a new and alternative data source, we cannot deny the advantages of search engine data for monitoring diseases. To date, search engine data have been used to track the flu [1, 5], dengue fever [6, 7], Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) [8, 9] and several other diseases. Lazer et al. [3] have argued that search engine data, such as those used in Google Flu Trends and in other major data sets, should not be used alone but should instead be used as a supplement to traditional data. The integrated use of search engine data with conventional data sources has been proven to increase the accuracy of disease predictions [3, 6, 10].",

Only a few studies have accounted for the internal spatial structure of an area, and most studies have not attempted to reduce search engine data biases levels. To complement previous studies, in this paper we use data related to HFMD in addressing three questions: (1) Is there a spatial difference in the search volume and search behaviors of HFMD? (2) Can historical cases of HFMD be used to reduce web data bias levels and to improve the relationship between search volume and real cases? (3) Can search engine data serve as a suitable tool for tracking HFMD trends in our pilot study area, Guangdong Province?",

Using a standard form, each district is required to report any cases of HFMD to this system daily [14, 17]. The reported information includes details about each patient (i.e., sex, birthday, home address, date of symptom onset, and date of diagnosis). Although reporting gaps or biases can result during the data collection process, this system is the country\u2019s leading authority on HFMD data. As individuals are most likely to search for information on the disease immediately after one of their children has fallen ill, in our study, daily cases in each city were counted based on one attribute: the date of symptom onset. Weekly cases were then counted by adding up the number of daily cases every seven days. Throughout the study, historical HFMD cases were used as a reference standard to facilitate the selection of correlated search engine data. Only the number of cases is presented here, and we thus use and present no information on individual cases.",

In addition, it typically takes approximately two weeks before the monitoring system\u2019s formal report of its syndromic data is made public [23]. As a complement to the existing monitoring method, crowdsourced tracking and web data mining systems provide detailed and near-real-time information on diseases that is accessible at a marginal cost [4, 24]. Crowdsourced tracking systems call upon ordinary citizens to report on diseases that they encounter firsthand [25\u201330]. Alternatively, web data mining techniques are used to mine valuable disease information from the Internet, which has proven to be effective at monitoring diseases. For example, disease-related information is gathered by machines in order to better understand and record data in online systems [31, 32], disease-related keywords that individuals use in search engines are monitored [1, 5, 11, 33, 34], and text information posted on social media sites that relates to an individual getting sick is mined and analyzed [35\u201337]. Of all of the resources currently available, the use of search engine query data, which can be easily accessed through products such as Google Trends and the Baidu Index, is the most common method used to monitor diseases.",

The Baidu Index provides data on three spatial scales: country-, province- and city-wide. To date, the Baidu Index has been used to track influenza [6] and H7N9 [8] trends in China. However, previous studies have primarily focused on a single spatial scale [1, 11\u201313]. In this study, however, to better understand the relationship between HFMD cases and search volume levels, the search index of 11 keywords (Table 1) that are most highly correlated with HFMD are collected at the provincial and municipal scales. We collect our search terms using the collection process described by Yuan et al. [11]. We identify keywords by not only considering HFMD\u2019s morbidity information but also by selecting recommended words from the following website: http://tool.chinaz.com/baidu/words.aspx. This website provides search engine optimization services and can identify the keywords most frequently used by Internet users in China.",

In the last step, to ensure the keywords do not have lag effects in monitoring HFMD, we examine cross correlations between the keywords and the HFMD cases that last 0\u20137 weeks, both before and after the current period. Finally, 11 keywords are found to have a maximum cross correlation with the HFMD cases of more than 0.6. These data are then processed into weekly data and, based on their attributes, are classified into three groups: General Keywords, Prevention Keywords and Treatment Keywords (see S1 Text for more detail). The composite index is counted by adding these three types of keywords together. S2 Fig presents actual HFMD cases and the Baidu Index for the study period.

Google has stopped publishing current estimates of GFT online, although researchers who wish to use the latest GFT data can still ask Google for access. Previous studies have reported on various weaknesses of search engine data; however, few of these studies have attempted to address these issues or to effectively improve prediction accuracy levels. In our study, we introduce the B-SHADE method as a means of using historical cases to improve the usability and stability of search engine data. In consideration of not only relationships between cities but also of the ratio of each city\u2019s size throughout a province, in estimating the search volume of an entire province, ten cities with the highest correlations with real cases were selected as sample cities. Both the correlations and predictive accuracy levels found were improvements from those of the original data.

Developed cities located within the PRD show a stronger correlation with treatment and prevention keywords whereas, compared to cities located outside of the delta region, their correlation with general keywords and the composite index is relatively low. This phenomenon may be due to superior medical devices and higher levels of education that characterize the PRD region in addition to the fact that developed cities include more hospital staff, researchers and teachers, all of whom are likely to use treatment and prevention keywords preferentially. The lower correlation between general keywords and the composite index for the developed cities may be attributable to the fact that general keywords, which are primarily used by ordinary people and by the media, can easily be disturbed by external factors and government policies. Cook et al. [41] suggested that search engine data should perform poorly for diseases that are subject to high media exposure (e.g., the H1N1 pandemic of 2009). HFMD, which is also a seasonal epidemic, always attracts media attention during its outbreak season, and it therefore presents biases in search engine data. Salath\u00e9 et al. [40] also found that public interest in media reports will wane over time even if new cases continue to emerge. All of these uncertainties contribute to search engine data biases, particularly in terms of general keywords, which also heavily influence the accuracy of the composite index.",

By properly selecting samples of the voting population, even 3,000 interviews can accurately predict a final voting result. As this case is similar to the voting problem, we sought to select cities with an unbiased search volume to predict the total search volume for the entire province. The original correlation for the entire province was found to be 0.8, but 10 cities showed a correlation of close to or larger than 0.8. When these cities were selected as sample cities to estimate the total search volume for the entire province (21 cities) via B-SHADE, the correlation improved from 0.8 to 0.864.

This is attributable to the fact that the revised search volume takes advantage of historical relationships between HFMD cases for each city and of the highly precise search volumes of the sampled cities. After our revisions, the MAE was recorded as 749.2, signifying that each city\u2019s error level represented approximately 35.68 cases per week. This result is not only better than the error level generated when strictly using historical HFMD cases, the composite index, and the revised index but rather it is also 11.19% lower than the error level generated when combining the composite index with lagged CCDC data. While Cayce et al. [8] found Google Trends to serve as a suitable tool for tracking HFMD trends in developed countries in Asia (e.g., Singapore and Japan), they also found that Google Trends is not strongly correlated with surveillance data in Hong Kong. This phenomenon may be more pronounced for developing countries where regional differences are significant. The spatial diversity of the regional economy and of Internet access levels has limited the capacities of search engine data in accurately tracking disease trends in developing countries and regions. By tracking a number of important cities from which high quality search engine data can be easily obtained, our method has the potential to help countries predict the total number of diseases cases (e.g., HFMD and influenza) to occur in advance (especially for countries that present significant regional differences).",

Another limitation relates to the fact that compared to traditional surveillance methods, search engine-based surveillance requires Internet access. According to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), the Internet was available to 48.8% of all Chinese citizens in June of 2015 [43]. While we assume that the guardians of children who suffer from HFMD search online for certain information, not every guardian is in the habit of conducting online information searches. Finally, our estimations of total search volume were based on the assumption that the historical space-time structure of HFMD prevalence can also describe online research trends on HFMD.
