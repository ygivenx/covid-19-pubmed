It is generally accepted that dogs were domesticated from the wolf (Canis lupus pallipes or C. lupus variabilis) in a process of symbiosis that evolved through selective breeding [3]. Indeed, dogs are termed as \u2018domestic\u2019 or \u2018domesticated\u2019 animals due to its association with humans and to the role that humans exercised in the emergence of this lineage [4]. Since domestication, this relationship became even more intense and dogs are ubiquitous in the cultural context of every society, constituting the most abundant carnivore animal on the planet [5]. Dogs have been associated with their owners\u2019 welfare and well-being [6, 7] and have started to play different functions [2] due to their malleable personalities, docile behavior and utility as guardians and hunters [8].",

Elimination by killing is not considered effective, since the number of removed animals is compensated for the increased entry and survival of the remaining ones. In addition, this method is the subject of much criticism based on ethical issues [20\u201322]. As a result, actions towards promoting responsible animal ownership, the strengthening of legislation against abandonment, and surgical control have been established in different countries [20, 23]. Annually, thousands of unrestricted dogs are sterilized in veterinary clinics and in campaigns run by governments and non-governmental organizations. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this measure, in the long term, has been poorly evaluated [24, 25]",

Abundance of free-roaming dogs in general is lower in rural than urban areas [42, 43].

Few studies, however, aimed at estimating the survival of free-ranging dogs in urban environment. Reece et al. [46] used data from a sterilization program to estimate the survival of castrated females in Jaipur, India. Annual survival of females aged over one year old was 0.70 and of females in their first year of life was 0.25. The assumptions leading to these estimates were implausible and might have biased the results. Pal [47] conducted four annual capture efforts, in Bengal, India, and estimated the canine mortality from the number of dogs observed in the captures after the first one. Annual survival for adult dogs was 0.91, and for dogs in their first year of life, 0.18. This study did not report capture probabilities and included in estimation only dogs found dead. This approach possibly contributed to an overestimation of the survival probability. Survival probability reported by Beck [1], in a study conducted in Baltimore, Canada, with dogs of all age groups, was 0.70. This author relied only on existing information regarding the number of dead dogs, also possibly leading to an underestimation of mortality and consequently to an overestimation of survival probability.",

Once the proper identification of the dogs\u2019 ages was outside the scope of our project, estimates in the present study refer to the general survival probability of the population and not age-specific probabilities. Annual survival in our study was higher than that estimated for dogs aged less than one year [46, 47], and lower than the survival probability estimated for adult dogs [46, 47] and for Beck\u2019s study population [1]. The low survival probability identified in the population results from the different sources of mortality experienced by free-roaming dogs in the study setting. Residents often reported roadkill and poisoning episodes during the study period. The high prevalence of CanL-seropositive dogs, especially in the first months of the study, is another relevant factor leading to the removal of many animals by euthanasia. Additionally, government actions towards street dogs were restricted to rabies vaccination. The lack of additional prophylactic measures or treatment may have contributed to the increased susceptibility of dogs to infections and other conditions.",

Most pet owners prefer male dogs since they do not get pregnant and are better guard dogs [28, 41].

Annual point estimates of survival probability found in the literature do not bear a longitudinal structure. Our results show that survival of unrestricted dogs displays variations, even in short temporal scales. Among the models fitted to the data, those in which survival did not vary with time had significantly lower weights, indicating that a constant value is not appropriate to representing the entire period. Estimates of survival probabilities in other mammal species also show a temporal dependence, especially in young individuals [53\u201355]. Long-term studies are required to uncover the intrinsic and extrinsic determinants driving these temporal dependencies. This would be useful for understanding the population dynamics of free-ranging dogs and improving the validity and precision of predictive modelling procedures. Such studies are difficult to perform, and thus are rare in the literature [56]. Despite being a short-term study, survival, recruitment and population size displayed an increasing tendency. This pattern suggests that density-independent factors could be responsible for driving the variations observed in survival probabilities of dogs in both areas.",

In epidemiological and ecological modeling, one assumes that survival and recruitment rates in free-ranging dogs are driven by the availability of resources in the environment, a density-dependent mechanism [61]. However, as pointed out by de Little et al. [56], extrinsic factors not regulated by density may determine fluctuations in population size when those populations have not yet reached their carrying capacity or when environmental conditions are favorable. According to Morters [61], human beings are the major agents responsible for providing care and adequate food for dogs. As a result, human related factors such as living together with free-ranging dogs, the low dog-human ratio and the availability of residents\u2019 resources to maintain these animals, may explain why the increase in density had no influence upon mortality and recruitment. Reducing the availability of shelters and food is an ethically questionable measure for population control of free-roaming dogs. However, this alternative has been presented in a recent study [62].",

We observed no females with their brood along the study period. We might infer that breeding females were located in less visible areas or put to adoption by the city public service and returned to the streets after the lactation period, even though such registries were rare. In the study of Morters et al. [61], as well as in the present study, recruitment was driven, predominantly, by the arrival of adult animals. The recruitment contingent may comprise dogs born in the region and not identified as puppies, dogs from other regions that migrated to the study region or were relocated by residents who raised them unrestrictedly, previously restricted dogs that changed status to being freely raised, or dogs abandoned nearby that later joined the population. The study areas are geographically isolated from their neighboring regions and are located next to a highway where dogs were frequently abandoned. Therefore, the latter mechanism seems more plausible to account for the increase in population size rather than the spontaneous immigration of dogs. Although there are heterogeneities [67], free-ranging dogs are territorial animals that, in general, do not move across long distances, unless forced by unfavorable environmental conditions [1]. The low mobility of dogs in a favorable environment is supported by our data, since there were no animal movements between the areas A and B.",

A high population turnover is the major obstacle for the success of control strategies against rabies in developing countries [68]. Vaccination strategies under such population dynamics must occur in short intervals and achieve high coverage in order to maintain proper levels of immunization. On the other hand, the replacement of euthanized dogs by susceptible animals and new individuals entering the reservoir compartment are the main causes of the low effectiveness of the euthanasia of seropositive dogs, a control strategy adopted in Brazil against leishmaniasis [69]. In addition, the population also becomes younger and more likely to acquire other infections under the high turnover regime [70].",

On the other hand, \u201cfast breeding\u201d mammals complete their reproductive cycle within their first year of life and place emphasis on fertility as their survival strategy as a species [71, 72]. Control of the population size of \u201cfast breeding\u201d animals, such as dogs [73], is more effectiveness when relying on measures that restrict entry of new individuals into the population as opposed to subjecting animals to euthanasia, a practice that reduces adults\u2019 survival. The fast versus slow breeding rationale, the sensitive ethical issues, and the low effectiveness of euthanizing animals observed in regions where this practice has been applied [20, 61, 74] prompted us to only consider sterilization, and not culling, as an alternative control strategy in our study.

After one year and two months, we observed no difference in survival, entrance or recruitment probability between the control region and the intervention area where 88% of the dogs were sterilized. The impact of sterilization takes place slowly as suggested by modeling exercises. It might take up to five years for the first impact of sterilization to become apparent and up to 30 years of uninterrupted efforts to reach its maximum impact [75]. Reece and Chawla [24] evaluated a program that surgically sterilized 19,129 neighborhood dogs in Jaipur, India, for eight years and showed that the population declined by only 28 per cent. On the other hand, Frank and Carlisle-Frank [76] observed only a small impact of a sterilization program on the number of dogs joining a shelter in the United States. Amaku et al. [77], based on results from a mathematical model developed specifically for stray dogs, concluded that sterilization becomes inefficient in the presence of high abandonment rates, even after prolonged periods of use. Natoli et al. [78] reached the same conclusion after studying for 10 years the impact of a castration and devolution program on a non-restricted cat population. Continuous negligent practices of animal ownership, including abandonment, had a negative impact on the sterilization strategy rendering it ineffective and countering the effect of 8,000 surgical interventions undertaken in that study. Finally, in a study conducted in Brazil, Dias et al. [79] concluded that it is counter-productive to invest in sporadic sterilization campaigns of owned dogs, the currently strategy adopted in most of Brazilian municipalities.",

In this context, it becomes apparent that public health services and non-governmental organizations must develop and prioritize more effective strategies against abandonment practices. In countries where free-ranging dogs are considered a humanitarian or a public health issue the implementation of educational programs addressing responsible animal owning at different levels, the registration of dogs and their owners and the improvement of legislation aimed at those who wish to have a pet becomes imperative [81].",

Different studies aimed at estimating the abundance of free-roaming dogs did not model or even consider the existence of differences in the probabilities of dog detection [28]. As pointed out before [28], counting techniques should be carried out only in short periods of time and when no other alternative becomes available considering logistics, geography and culture of the study region. Values of capture probabilities obtained in the present study are similar to those estimated by Kalati in a population of urban free-ranging dogs in Kathmandu [85] and may be used as correction factors for the previously published estimates of abundance.",

Survival probability was small and probability of animal entry in the population was high during the 14 months period of follow-up. High turnover, attributed mostly to the abandonment of pet dogs, has important implications to the population composition and the control of zoonosis. Estimates of survival, recruitment and capture probabilities varied over time. Survival and recruitment showed an increasing tendency. Mortality patterns did not differ between genders. The probability of entry in the population was higher among males. The observed population dynamics seem to be driven by density-independent factors. Sterilization, in turn, had no influence upon the parameters analyzed. Our observations are useful for a better understanding of the population dynamics of free-roaming dogs and may aid in the planning, designing and evaluation of population control actions. In this context, it becomes imperative that public health services and nongovernmental organizations develop educational training programs addressing responsible animal ownership and better strategies against abandonment practices. Parameter estimates may also be used as input to new predictive mathematical models. Even though our study generated important answers and new hypotheses, the scarcity of existent knowledge and the misuse of the proper methodology raise numerous relevant questions yet to be elucidated about the population dynamics of free-roaming dogs.",
