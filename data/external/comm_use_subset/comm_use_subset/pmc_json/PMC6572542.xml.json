            "text": "The search for an effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine has spanned over 30 years with hundreds of billions of dollars spent with no success [1]. The repeated standard textbook explanation for this mystery is that because of the retroviral nature of HIV, its replication involves an error-prone reverse RNA to DNA transcription, making HIV vulnerable to mutation and thereby providing more means for escaping the host immune system [2,3,4,5]. While there is likely some truth to this, a closer look at all available data reveals that such an explanation is limited as there are several counterexamples for this hypothesis. For instance, if this would be the case for all retroviruses that utilize the error-prone reverse transcription as the definition of retrovirus entails, why then effective vaccines have been found for HIV\u2019s horse cousin, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), at least since 1973? [6,7,8,9,10]. Furthermore, it should be noted that HIV is not the only virus, for which an effective vaccine is yet to be found despite enormous efforts. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) are such examples, and, incidentally, these are not retroviruses, which seem to contradict the aforementioned textbook dogma. In fact, HCV and HSV-2 are single-stranded RNA and double-stranded linear DNA viruses, respectively. It would seem strangely coincidental that HIV, HCV, and HSV-2 all have strong sexual transmission components. The connection between sexual transmission and the unavailability of an effective vaccine is something that has never been and simply cannot be explained by the current textbook paradigm.",

            "text": "Given the serious deficiencies of the current textbook paradigm, it is clear that a mystery has been quietly plaguing the biomedical community for over three decades, and a new explanatory framework that could adequately address the aforementioned puzzles is much needed. This paper describes the concept of viral shell disorder or shapeshifting that was first introduced by us in a 2008 study that reported a strange characteristic not previously noticed in the outer shell and matrix of the HIV-1, namely the HIV-1 matrix was found to be highly disordered [11]. In fact, using advanced computational techniques (e.g., PONDR\u00ae-VLXT) we showed that depending on a strain, the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in HIV-1 matrix protein (p17) can be as high as 70%, the levels, which are very rare in the outer shells of other viruses [11,12]. A decade has passed since the publication of that paper, and plenty of both computational and experimental data have been made available. For instance, we now know that the basis of its theoretical framework can be found in the 1920s classical experiments of Oswald T. Avery and Walther F. Goebel, who showed that bacterial polysaccharides are essentially ineffective as vaccines, but may become efficient being held together as a rigid conjugate with proteins [3,12,13,14,15]. Furthermore, a shell disorder database of over 300 viruses and strains has been built with much of its data made publicly available [3,16]. With the availability of information for a wide variety of viruses that include polio, rabies, HCV, HSV, and yellow fever viruses (YFV) [3,11,12,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26] important comparisons become feasible as we shall see below.",

Having known which proteins (or protein regions) are easily crystallizable and which are not, a neural network can be trained on the sequences of the appropriate proteins to give rise to a disorder predictor. The aforementioned peculiarity of HIV was discovered using one of such disorder predictors, PONDR\u00ae-VLXT [11]. Historically, PONDR\u00ae-VLXT was the first intrinsic disorder predictor, and it uses a neural network that takes a protein sequence as input and provides disorder or order score for each residue as output (http://www.pondr.com) [31,32]. PONDR\u00ae-VLXT was chosen as the ideal predictor for our studies, as it is known to be a sensitive tool for predicting disorder-based protein-protein interactions [33,34,35]. This predictor has been shown to be a reliable tool in providing insights into a long list of medically important viruses, such as the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus, Ebola, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Flaviviridae viruses [3,11,17,18,19,20,22,25,26].",

These protective capsids are formed as single or double protein shells and consist of only one or a few structural protein species. An outermost layer of capsid consists of a glycoprotein and can be followed by at least one more protein shell layer. Some viruses also contain an envelope, which is an additional covering usually derived from the modified host cell membranes [36,37]. The number of shell layers depends on the type of virus. Figure 1 shows examples of shells of various viruses. The HIV and other retroviruses have three layers, the matrix, the capsid, and the nucleocapsid, as seen in Figure 1a. The rabies virus, on the other hand, has only two layers (Figure 1b). Interestingly, Figure 1c shows that smallpox virus has multiple shell layers. Since the number of shell layers might define the sustainability of viruses, it is not surprising that smallpox can survive in the environment for a long time, a characteristic known to the laboratory workers who handle the virus. In fact, a 19th century English medical journal (Medical and Physical Journal No. 199) described, based on a previous report [38], an incident in England, where a worker clearing a 30-year-old grave was infected with smallpox [3,39,40].

Different viruses also show various levels of their proteome complexity. For example, the HIV genome encodes only 15 proteins, with repeating units of one protein for each shell level. The herpes simplex virus (HSV), on the other hand, has as many as 84 proteins, with its tegument (matrix, outer shell) containing as many as 20 different proteins [2,41]. Another complex DNA virus is the smallpox virus that contains over 200 proteins [2].",

HIV, HSV-2, and HCV are good references for viruses that have no available vaccines as of yet [3,26]. HIV was first discovered in 1984, and efforts for vaccine development began almost immediately, whereas HSV-2 has been known since ancient times and the first vaccine effort began in the 1920s [3]. In 2009, a very large HIV vaccine trial took place in Thailand that failed disastrously. For HSV, a large vaccine trial involving 8323 women took place in 2012 and, like the HIV trial, it ended in failure especially for HSV-2 [41]. By contrast, investigational vaccine was effective in preventing HSV-1 genital disease and infection [41]. Interestingly, HSV-2 is usually spread via sexual intercourse, whereas HSV-1 can be spread by kissing, even though the two viruses are closely related [42]. For this reason, HSV-2 is highlighted in our selection of viruses. Importantly, that all three viruses, HSV-2, HCV, and HIV, have a sexual component as a major transmission mechanism. It should be noted that these three viruses were not deliberately chosen for their sexual transmission, but, rather, for their current lack of an effective vaccine.",

However, more recent data indicated that HCV can be easily sexually transmitted, when at least one partner is HIV positive [43,44,45]. Furthermore, it is also more easily transmitted via anal sex [43]. HCV belongs to the genus Hepacivirus of the Flaviviridae family [26], which makes it a somewhat distant relative to the mosquito-borne YFV and dengue viruses that belong to the genus Flavivirus, and, thus, making HCV and YFV an interesting comparative pair. HCV is physiologically different from YFV, since it has no membrane protein layer, thereby making its core proteins the outermost shell layer. ",

EIAV, which is a horse cousin of HIV, has also been selected. Because it has the same virion physiology as HIV, its inclusion provides means for a comparative study. Although for ages, smallpox was a deadly curse killing a third of those infected with variola virus, this disease is now eradicated, and an effective vaccine using cowpox was discovered by Edward Jenner in 1796 [4,46,47]. An effective rabies vaccine was discovered by the great Louis Pasteur in the dawn of modern microbiology in the late 19th century [48]. Poliovirus, which spreads mainly by fecal-oral routes among humans, is also an ancient threat, for which effective vaccines developed by Jonas Salk became available in the 1950s [49]. YFV is a highly pathogenic virus spread by mosquitoes, for which an effective vaccine was first discovered by Max Theiler in 1937 [50].",

Effective vaccines have been found since 1973 or earlier [8,9,10,36,51]. Some of the vaccines are known to have as high as 100% efficacy. In contrast, hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent for over 30 years in search of a HIV vaccine without any success. What is the mystery here? The answer can be found in Table 2 and Figure 2b, which show that all three layers of the EIAV shell are well-ordered (Matrix PID: 13 \u00b1 0.1%; Capsid PID: 29 \u00b1 0.1%; Nucleocapsid PID: 26 \u00b1 0.1%) [11,25]. The HIV, on the other hand, has a high matrix disorder, but moderate levels of disorder for the inner shell layers. A sharp contrast can be seen in the X-ray crystal structures presented in Figure 3, where HIV-1 matrix protein has long stretches of disorder as represented by red color (Figure 3a) but only few disordered regions can be found in the EIAV matrix (Figure 3b). The found differences in disorder levels can be explained in terms of viral evolution and modes of transmission. The EIAV finds greater fitness for well-ordered and rigid virus particles that are able to survive in the mouthpiece of the insect, given that they will be exposed to harsh environment, such as saliva, containing proteolytic enzymes during its transportation between horses. For this reason, the EIAV cannot \u201cafford\u201d a soft disordered matrix that would help this virus to evade the host immune system, as seen for the sexually transmitted HIV. ",

For instance, all major shell proteins of variola virus are highly ordered, having PID scores below 30% [3]. The fact that both inner and outer shells are highly ordered corroborates with the fact that the smallpox virus has been historically known to persist in the environment for a long time. On the other hand, the fact that its major shell proteins are ordered could explain the reason that the smallpox vaccine was the earliest vaccine found. The rabies virus illustrates the same case but not to such extremes. The rabies virus has matrix and nucleocapsid PIDs below 30% [11], which are considered low. This hardness of the shell can explain the fact that the rabies vaccine is one of the first to be discovered during the dawn of modern microbiology.",

The complexation of proteins allows poliovirus and its Picornaviridae cousins to have large fecal-oral transmission components through a formation of a rigid capsid as seen in Figure 3c. Furthermore, disorder helps with the complexation since disorder plays a role in recognition of binding partners. Nevertheless, when we measured the PID for each of the proteins, telltale signs of relative order necessary for its fecal-oral transmission is seen. We can see that the highest PID among the polio capsid proteins is still below 40%, while the lowest PID is less than 20%. These figures are still considered low in comparison to the HIV matrix PID that could reach a high of 70% (see Figure 2b). ",

A counter argument for such analogy is that, unlike HIV, there are vaccines for influenza available. Their effectiveness varies each season depending on the successful anticipation and matching of oncoming strains for the season. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), influenza vaccine can reduce the chances of serious illness by 40\u201360% (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect.htm). The matrix PID mean (35.2 \u00b1 1.6) for influenza virus as seen in Table 1, looks nothing like those of HIV, HSV or HCV and thus seems to lend support towards the idea of greater ease and feasibility of finding effective vaccines for influenza in contrast to HIV.

While its outer shell PID is close to 35%, the PID of its inner shell protein jumps to above a whopping 70% [12,25]. It is the only virus in our sample that has a moderately ordered outer shell but highly disordered inner shell. As mentioned, an effective vaccine against the YFV infection was discovered in 1938, which again re-affirms the paradigm of ordered outer shell and vaccine success. The highly disordered inner shell is something that has been seen not just in the YFV, but also in other highly pathogenic viruses, such as SARS-CoV and Ebola virus [3,11,12,20,22,25,26], even though the case of rabies tells us that a highly disordered inner shell is not an absolute requirement for virulence. While a highly disordered outer shell is a characteristic of a virus that can be described as a true viral \u201cshapeshifter\u201d that uses structural flexibility of their outer shells to directly evade the host immune system, a highly disordered inner shell found in YFV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola suggests the existence of a viral shapeshifter of another kind, a kind of \u201ctrojan\u201d horse. More specifically, the disordered inner shell may help the virus to multiply rapidly before the immune system can respond. It does so through the protein promiscuity arising from the greater levels of protein disorder. In other words, in these cases, the virulence arises from the ability of the virus to multiply rapidly especially in vital organs [25,26]. The inner shell proteins (and sometimes also the outer shell proteins) usually play vital roles in the replication of the virus by attaching themselves to the proteins of the host cell [52]. By being disordered and thus promiscuous, the viral protein is able to bind to a greater variety of proteins that it would not normally bind to [11,12,25,26,30,42,53,54].",

Although certain strains of HIV-1 could reach a PID of 70% and the mean matrix PID of HIV-1 is 56.5 \u00b1 10.8%, some HIV strains have lower PIDs. The difference between HIV-2 (PID: 51.5 \u00b1 2.5) and HIV-1 (PID: 56.5 \u00b1 10.8) mean PIDs provides us with not just an explanation indicative of the differences between the two viruses but perhaps also explanatory hints pertaining to the differences among the various HIV-1 strains. HIV-2 is predominantly found in West Africa, where its reservoir lies in the population of the SIV-infected sooty mangabey monkeys that dwell in the rainforests [11,12,52]. Unlike the globally widespread HIV-1, HIV-2 therefore needs to be constantly replenished by the transfer of virus between the monkeys and humans via bites and consumptions of bushmeat. While both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are mainly sexually transmitted, HIV-2 has obviously a slightly greater non-sexual transmission component that provides for greater fitness if the virus is able to stay longer in the environment and in the primates\u2019 saliva, which could potentially harm the virus. This explains the somewhat lower mean HIV-2 matrix PID (51.5 \u00b1 2.5) that is not anywhere near the 60\u201370% seen in some HIV-1 strains. ",

            "text": "An interesting trend, that can be seen in not just HIV but also in viruses in general, is the tendency for a virus with a more disordered outer shell to have a more ordered inner shell and vice-versa. This can be explained if we see the virus as compensating the cost of having a soft outer shell by having a harder inner shell in an effort to protect its genome from the environment. Conversely, if the virus has a harder outer shell, it then has the luxury of more disordered inner shell proteins. This may explain why HIV-1\u2019s innermost shell proteins (p7) drop dramatically in PID (39.5 \u00b1 3.0%) especially when compared to HIV-2 (46.5 \u00b1 0.1%). Oddly, the intermediate shell (capsid) PID of HIV-2 (26.6 \u00b1 2.9%) is even lower than that of HIV-1 (44.5 \u00b1 1.6%). Perhaps HIV-2 needs further reinforcement for its outermost shell (matrix) as a result of the harsher environment required in its spread via monkey bites and bushmeat consumptions. Another interesting note, given the differences in matrix PID of HIV-1 and HIV2, is the fact that HIV-1 is much more virulent than its HIV-2. HIV-1 kills over 90% of those infected within a few years of infection in the absence of antiviral drugs, whereas HIV-2 takes a much longer time to kill its host if at all [11,12,55]. The reason for this is not entirely clear but HIV-1 infections usually involve higher viral-load in host body. Apparently, the highly disordered matrix helps evade the host immune system. Another possibility is that the higher disordered matrix may allow greater promiscuous binding of host cells and thereby help increase the viral load [11,12]. ",

One reason for the difference has already been mentioned. HCV is not easily transmitted by sexual intercourse but is seen as transmitted mainly by blood contamination especially via illicit drugs use. Interestingly, blood contamination does not usually require the virus to remain in harsh non-physiological environment considering the fact that the virus is likely to remain in an aqueous blood environment throughout the transmission. Incidentally, HIV-1 is also commonly spread among drug users via blood contamination [11,55]. A better explanation for the lower outer shell PID in HCV (52.5 \u00b1 0.5, 48.5 \u00b1 0.5), in contrast to HIV (56.5 \u00b1 10.8), has to do with the fact that HCV is a hepatitis virus that is likely to be in contact at various times with bile, which is produced by the liver. Bile digests lipids and is known to be capable of damaging microbes such as bacteria [56]. ",

The best we can do is to limit our study to just the major tegument proteins. We have also seen that modes of transmission of HSV are highly complex with HSV-1 and HSV-2 having different modes of transmission. While HSV-1 and HSV-2 are usually casually and sexually transmitted respectively, their evolutions and genetics are often intertwined as they are closely related. For instance, it was believed that genital herpes was solely the result of HSV-2 infections but nowadays with the practice of oral sex, clinical studies have seen cases of genital herpes arising from HSV-1 infections [57]. As if it is not already complicated, HSV-1/2 chimeras, i.e., a virus with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 genes, have been found worldwide [58]. Such is to be expected as it has been previously observed that in other viruses such as HIV, closely related viruses do often exchange genes regularly especially in cases when two viruses infect a host simultaneously [55].

As mentioned, just as a highly disordered matrix can be found in HIV-1, high disorder can be found in the major tegument (matrix) proteins of HSV. We need, however, to remember that the minor proteins of HSV have not been considered and many of the minor (less abundant) proteins are ordered. Given the transmission mode by salivary contacts in HSV-1 and the constant gene exchanges between HSV-1 and HSV-1, some levels of order should be expected, unlike HIV. Differences in the tegument PIDs between HSV-1 and HSV-2 are also found to be in the right \u201cdirection\u201d i.e., the more sexual HSV-2 being more disordered than the more casually transmitted HSV-1. As seen in Table 1, HSV-2 has three major tegument proteins (UL49, UL47, UL48) that have higher PIDs (2\u20133% higher) than the corresponding proteins of HSV-1. HSV-1, on the other hand, has only one protein than is higher than that of HSV-2 but that is higher by just 0.5% (UL36) in contrast to the 2\u20133% seen in the three mentioned proteins. It is also misleading to assume that the percentage differences are insignificant because they are small. The proteins involved are large and therefore the number of residues involved can be relatively substantial. For example, UL47 is 693 residues long. Furthermore, it is also possible that the disordered regions are strategically located in closer proximity to an outer membrane where it matters most but we do not know this for sure. Lastly, we should not forget that the proteins mentioned are major tegument proteins. In other words, copies of the proteins are abundantly found in the tegument [42,53].",

Goebel conducted a series of classical experiments that have greatly contributed to the successful design of many vaccines even today [13,14,15]. In that studies, they synthesized polysaccharides of bacteria Pneumococcus and inoculated the respective samples into rabbits. However, they found out, much to their dismay and puzzlement, that there was no immune response. They, however, came up with an idea of tying the polysaccharides together using a protein linker. Then, they injected the glyco-conjugate, as it was called, into the rabbits, and this time they observed expected immune response [13,14,15]. Interestingly, it was also found that the closer the linker resembles the natural bacterial protein linker, the greater the immune response was. These important observations are in line with our hypothesis, since we know now that many bacterial proteins are well-ordered, especially proteins found in bacterial shells, as bacteria often have to dwell in harsh places [63,64]. The two facts help reinforce the idea that the best immune response can be derived when the polysaccharides are held tightly together via rigid linkers. A corollary to this knowledge is that the more flexible the linkers are, the likelier it is the immune response will be poor. This corollary forms the experimental basis of the concept of the viral shapeshifting or shell disorder and immune evasion.",

The lack of the neutralizing antibodies themselves presented a huge mystery that had been nagging the biomedical community until now.

Similarly, advances in cancer treatments have allowed the cancer virotherapy to gain greater spotlight [69,70]. Viruses do have oncolytic potentials or abilities to lyse cancer cells, because they share the same signaling systems, and cancer cells often over-express receptors necessary for viral entry [71].

Viruses can be engineered to behave like HIV-1, which, as we have seen evades the immune system efficiently and moves easily to organs that are normally difficult to reach, like the brain [54]. Another factor is that cancer cells can hide out in poorly accessible places, such as the brain. Here again, the concept of shell disorder can come in handy, as protein intrinsic disorder allows for greater binding promiscuity [30] and therefore can help viruses to enter into vital organs, such as the brain [12]. In line with these considerations is the fact that HIV enters the brain and other vital organs with ease.",

As is commonly observed for IDRs, FBP undergoes a disorder-to order transition as it binds tightly to its partner, fibronectin [75]. While in principle antibodies against FBP would be an effective therapy against S. aureus, attempts to raise such antibodies have not been successful [74]. Similar failures to obtain antibodies against the host-targeting proteins have been observed for several pathogens not counting the three viral examples discussed herein, suggesting that the evolution and utilization of disorder-to-order transitions for binding to host targets may be a strategy commonly used by pathogens to avoid immunological neutralization [27,76].

Figure 2a shows the mean PID, whereas, in (b,c), each PID represents maximal PID found for the specific protein. The reason for the use of both mean and maximal values is that the mean PID alone can be quite misleading for the readers, and sometimes maximal number paints a more accurate picture. \u201cALL\u201d refers to the mean shell PIDs of viruses in general as seen in the current database of over 300 viruses and strains.
