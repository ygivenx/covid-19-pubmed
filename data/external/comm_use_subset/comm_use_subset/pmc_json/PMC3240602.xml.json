Among the identified host proteins are RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as ribosomal proteins, translation factors and RNA-modifying enzymes [1]\u2013[5]. The subverted host proteins likely affect several steps in viral RNA replication, including the assembly of the replicase complex and initiation of RNA synthesis. However, the detailed functions of recruited host RBPs in (+)RNA virus replication are known only for a small number of host factors [2], [6]\u2013[8].",

Accordingly, eEF1A has been shown to facilitate the assembly of the viral replicase complex and stimulate the initiation of minus-strand synthesis by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [23], [24]. Another translation elongation factor identified in our genome-wide screens with TBSV is eukaryotic elongation factor 1Bgamma (eEF1B\u03b3) [15]. eEF1B\u03b3 is an abundant, but not essential cellular protein, which is part of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1B complex also containing the eEF1B\u03b1 subunit in yeast and the eEF1B\u03b1 and eEF1B\u03b4 subunits in metazoans [28].The eEF1B complex is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for eEF1A, which binds and delivers aminoacyl-tRNA in the GTP-bound form to the elongating ribosome. Additional roles have been ascribed to eEF1B\u03b3 in vesicle-mediated intracellular protein transport, RNA-binding, vacuolar protein degradation, oxidative stress, intermediate filament interactions and calcium-dependent membrane-binding [29], [30], [31].",

Our approaches based on yeast and in vitro replication assays reveal that eEF1B\u03b3 is a component of the tombusvirus replicase and binds to the 3\u2032-end of the viral RNA. Using a cell-free replication assay, we define that eEF1B\u03b3 plays a role by enhancing minus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. The obtained data support the model that eEF1B\u03b3 opens up a \u2018closed\u2019 structure at the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV (+)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (-)-strand synthesis. Moreover, we find that eEF1B\u03b3 and eEF1A play nonoverlapping functions to enhance (-)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two translation factors regulate TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with different portions of the viral (+)RNA and the replication proteins.",

The CFE extracts were programmed with the TBSV (+)repRNA and purified recombinant p33 and p92pol obtained from E. coli.

The TCV RdRp, unlike the E. coli-expressed TBSV p92pol or the closely-related Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) p92pol RdRps, does not need the yeast CFE to be functional in vitro\n[35], [36]. Importantly, the template specificity of the recombinant TCV RdRp with TBSV RNAs is similar to the closely-related tombusvirus replicase purified from yeast or infected plants [10], [36], [37], [38]. The recombinant TCV RdRp preparation lacks co-purified eEF1B\u03b3 (E. coli does not have a homolog), unlike the yeast or plant-derived tombusvirus replicase preparations, facilitating studies on the role of eEF1B\u03b3 on the template activity of a viral RdRp. When we added various amounts of the highly purified recombinant eEF1B\u03b3 to the TCV RdRp assay programmed with TBSV-derived SL3-2-1(+) RNA template, which is used by the TCV RdRp in vitro to produce the complementary (-)RNA product [37], we observed a \u223c2-to-4-fold increase in (-)RNA synthesis by the TCV RdRp (Figure 2A, lanes 3\u20135). eEF1B\u03b3 in the absence of the TCV RdRp did not give a 32P-labeled RNA product, excluding that our eEF1B\u03b3 preparation contained RdRp activity (not shown).

Therefore, we tested the recruitment of the TBSV (+)repRNA to the membrane fraction in our CFE assay [23]. We found that eEF1B\u03b3 did not facilitate the association of the TBSV (+)repRNA with the membrane when applied in the absence of p33/p92 replication proteins (Figure S2). Moreover, eEF1B\u03b3 did not further increase the amount of TBSV (+)repRNA bound to the membrane in the presence of p33/p92 replication proteins, which are needed for RNA recruitment (Figure S2, lanes 3\u20134 and 8\u201310) [24].

To test the mutual effect of eEF1B\u03b3 and eEF1A on the (-)-strand RNA production of the viral RdRp, we performed in vitro RdRp assays with purified eEF1A and recombinant eEF1B\u03b3 as shown in Figure 6. Based on previous experiments, eEF1B\u03b3 was known to stimulate (-)-strand synthesis the most when pre-incubated with the template (+)RNA (Figure 2B). In contrast, pre-incubation of eEF1A with the viral RdRp was more effective than pre-incubation of eEF1A with the template RNA [23]. Therefore, we performed the pre-incubation experiments prior to the RdRp assay as shown in Figure 6. We found the largest stimulation of (-)-strand synthesis by the viral RdRp in a dual pre-incubation assay, when eEF1B\u03b3 was pre-incubated with the viral RNA template, while eEF1A was separately pre-incubated with the viral RdRp (Figure 6, lanes 3\u20134). Pre-incubation of eEF1B\u03b3 with the viral RNA template (lanes 5\u20136) or pre-incubation of eEF1A with the viral RdRp (lanes 7\u20138) were about half as efficient in stimulation of (-)-strand synthesis than the dual pre-incubation assay (lanes 3\u20134). Therefore, these data support the model that eEF1B\u03b3 and eEF1A both promote (-)-strand synthesis and their effect is synergistic, likely involving separate mechanisms (see Discussion).",

Accumulation of TMV genomic RNA was also dramatically reduced in both inoculated (Figure 8B) and systemically-infected (Figure 8C) leaves of the eEF1B\u03b3 knock-down plants. Based on these data, eEF1B\u03b3 seems to be needed for TMV replication and/or spread in plants. Thus, our data have revealed new functions for eEF1B\u03b3 in plant RNA virus replication and spread.",

Moreover, in vitro assays with highly purified eEF1B\u03b3 and the recombinant TCV RdRp, which is closely homologous with the TBSV p92pol, also revealed that eEF1B\u03b3 stimulates (-)-strand synthesis by binding to the viral (+)RNA template (Figure 3). Accordingly, pre-incubation of eEF1B\u03b3 and the TBSV-derived template RNA prior to the RdRp assay led to the highest level of stimulation of (-)RNA synthesis (Figure 2). On the other hand, eEF1B\u03b3 does not stimulate the RdRp activity directly, since pre-incubation of eEF1B\u03b3 with the RdRp did not lead to more efficient (-)-strand RNA synthesis in vitro (Figure 2). We propose that eEF1B\u03b3 modifies the structure of the (+)-strand template prior to initiation of (-)-strand synthesis that leads to more efficient RNA synthesis as described below.",

However, the gPR region is present in a \u2018closed\u2019 structure in the TBSV (+)RNA due to base-pairing of a portion of the gPR with the RSE present in SL3 as shown in Figure 9. This interaction makes the TBSV (+)RNA poor template in the in vitro assay due to the difficulty for the viral RdRp to recognize and/or open the \u2018closed\u2019 structure [39]. Our current work with eEF1B\u03b3, however, suggests that eEF1B\u03b3 can bind to the tetraloop region of SL1 (and to an A-rich sequence in SL2) that leads to melting of the base-paired structure and opening the stem of SL1 and the RSE-gPR base-pairing as shown schematically in Figure 9B. We propose that the open structure can be recognized efficiently by the viral replicase leading to efficient initiation of (-)-strand synthesis (Figure 9B). This model is supported by several pieces of evidence presented in this paper, including (i) stimulation of (-)-strand synthesis by eEF1B\u03b3 when the wt SL1 is present in the template; (ii) lack of stimulation of(-)-strand synthesis by eEF1B\u03b3 when a mutated SL1 (tetraloop mutant), which does not bind efficiently to eEF1B\u03b3, was used as a template in the in vitro assay; (iii) stimulation of (-)-strand synthesis when eEF1B\u03b3 was pre-incubated with the (+)-strand template, but not when eEF1B\u03b3 was pre-incubated with the viral RdRp (Figure 2); and (iv) the lack of stimulation of (+)-strand synthesis on a (-)-strand template by eEF1B\u03b3 (Figure 2). In addition, eEF1B\u03b3 stimulated (-)-strand synthesis by the viral RdRp when a partially complementary RNA oligo was hybridized with the SL1 region (Figure 4B). However, eEF1B\u03b3 could not efficiently bind to the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV RNA when it formed a hybrid (duplex) with a perfectly complementary DNA oligo (Figure 3A), suggesting that eEF1B\u03b3 can melt only the local secondary structure, but cannot unwind more extended duplex regions. An alternative possibility is that eEF1B\u03b3 protein stabilizes the unpaired structure (when the SL1 structure is kinetically pairing/unpairing), rather than implying that it actively \"opens\" the structure.",

Displacement of eEF1B\u03b3 bound to the 3\u2032-end by the viral replicase during (-)-strand synthesis could make the 3\u2032-terminus of the (+)-strand RNA fold back into a \u2018closed\u2019 structure. This could prevent efficient re-utilization of the original (+)-strand template during TBSV replication, and the switch to efficient (+)-strand synthesis on the (-)RNA intermediate (Figure 9B). This model can also explain why the newly made (+)-strand RNA progeny will not enter the replication cycle in the absence of bound eEF1B\u03b3 within the originally-formed replicase complexes as observed previously in the CFE assay [20]. We propose that the new (+)RNA progeny need to leave the replicase complex, then bind to eEF1B\u03b3 in the cytosol and assemble new replicase complexes, followed by a new round of viral RNA replication. Thus, this model suggests that eEF1B\u03b3 plays a key role in regulation of the use of (+)-strand RNAs in TBSV replication (Figure 9B).",

The binding of the RNA by eEF1B\u03b3 promotes the opening of the closed 3\u2032-terminal structure, whereas eEF1A facilitates the proper and efficient binding of the RdRp to the 3\u2032 terminal RSE sequence of the viral RNA, which is required for the assembly of the viral replicase complex [11], [39], prior to initiation of (-)-strand synthesis (Figure 9) [23], [24]. The binding of eEF1A-RdRp complex to the RSE might lead to proper positioning of the RdRp over the 3\u2032-terminal gPR promoter sequence opened up by eEF1B\u03b3, thus facilitating the initiation of (-)RNA synthesis starting from the 3\u2032-terminal cytosine (Figure 9B). Altogether, the two translation factors facilitate the efficient initiation of (-)-strand synthesis in addition to reducing the possibility of re-utilization of the (+)-strand template for additional rounds of (-)-strand synthesis. This regulation of RNA synthesis by the co-opted host factors shows the specialized use of host components to serve the need of viral replication.",

Since eEF1B\u03b3 is a highly conserved protein in all eukaryotes [32], it is not surprising that yeast eEF1B\u03b3, similar to the plant eEF1B\u03b3, can be co-opted for TBSV replication. Interestingly, deletion of either TEF3 or TEF4 genes reduced TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast, suggesting that eEF1B\u03b3 is present in limiting amount or eEF1B\u03b3 is present in not easily accessible forms (in protein complexes) and/or locations in yeast cells. Silencing of eEF1B\u03b3 in N. bethamiana showed even more inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation than deletion of eEF1B\u03b3 genes in yeast. This is likely due to the robust antiviral response (i.e., induced gene silencing) of the plant host, which could result in degradation of the small amount of viral RNA produced by the less efficient viral RNA replication in the presence of limited eEF1B\u03b3 in the knock-down plants.",

SL3-2-1m(+) RNA was generated with T7 transcription on PCR products amplified with primers #1662 and #1190, on a plasmid template harboring GGGCU nucleotide-deletion in SL3 region as described [39]. A duplex RNA was generated by hybridizing SL3-2-1(+) and SL3-2-ds1(-) made by T7 transcription of the PCR product using primers #4361 (GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTACTTCCGGTTGTCCGGTAGTGCTTCC) and # 4362 (CGGTTGATCTGACCCTTCGG). For hybridization, equal amounts of both RNAs were mixed in 1X STE buffer [0.1 M NaCl 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)] followed by treatments: 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 70 cycles with gradually lowering the temperature by 1\u00b0C at each cycle for 30 s and finally 20\u00b0C for 30s.",

The pESC-CUP1-FLAGHis-Tef4 plasmid was replaced with the pESC plasmid in the control experiment. Yeast was pre-grown overnight at 29\u00b0C in 2 ml SCULH- medium containing 2% glucose and 5 \u00b5M copper sulfate. The volume of the media was increased to 20 ml after 16 h for an additional 10 h (OD600 of \u223c0.8), then the cultures were transferred to 20 ml SCULH- medium containing 2% galactose to induce TBSV DI-72 RNA transcription at 23\u00b0C. The transcription of DI-72 RNA was stopped by changing to the media containing 2% glucose after 8 h. The cultures were diluted to 200 ml and copper sulfate was added to a final concentration of 50 \u00b5M to induce the expression of Flag-tagged Tef4 protein. After incubation at 23\u00b0C for 24 h, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 4 min.

Yeast cells were broken by glass beads in a FastPrep cell disruptor (MP Biomedicals) 4 times for 20 sec each at speed 5.5. Samples were removed and incubated 1 min in an ice-water bath after each treatment. The samples were centrifuged at 500 \u00d7g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to remove glass beads, unbroken cells and debris then supernatant was moved into fresh pre-chilled tubes.

The arrow indicates the middle-range RNA base-pairing that leads to a closed structure formed at the 3\u2032 end of TBSV RNA as shown in panel B. (B) We propose that eEF1B\u03b3 opens up the closed structure in the RNA, while eEF1A binds to both the p92pol replication protein and the RSE sequence. These events lead to proper positioning of p92pol over the \u201copened\u201d promoter sequence, thus facilitating initiation of minus-strand synthesis. Displacement of eEF1B\u03b3 from the (+)RNA during RNA synthesis decreases the probability of new rounds of initiation by p92pol on the original (+)RNA templates. Thus, these events favor limited minus-strand synthesis and facilitate plus-strand synthesis to generate excess amount of new (+)-strands.",
