Compared with sham-inoculated controls (Histopathologic Scores, HPS = 0-1), mice inoculated with live RSV showed significantly greater HPS, with a dense inflammatory infiltrate and severe pneumonia, which peaked on days 5-7 post-inoculation (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A; 1-8). To define the distribution of RSV antigens in the lungs, IHC staining was performed using a polyclonal RSV antibody. Immunostaining showed an increasingly positive stain for RSV in the alveolar epithelium from day 1 to days 3-4 and decreased by days 6-7 post-inoculation. On the other hand, IHC in alveolar macrophages was negative on day 1, occasionally positive on day 3, strong and diffusely positive on days 4 to 6 and also decreased by day 7. Both the alveolar epithelium and alveolar macrophages were negative for RSV staining on days 10 and 14 post-infection (Fig 6A; 6A-H). In contrast to airway obstruction, there was no significant correlation between the severity of lung inflammation (HPS) and blood RSV RNA loads on day 5, illustrating the different time course of these two parameters of disease severity (Fig. 6.B).",

Mice treated with the moAb had blood RSV RNA loads detected only from day 4 to 7, and showed significantly lower peak blood RSV RNA loads than non-treated RSV-infected mice on day 5.

Three studies documented the presence of RSV RNA by real-time PCR in blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a subset of neonates and children with RSV lower respiratory tract infection [8-10]. In those studies, RSV RNA was also found in the blood of a small percentage of children with no evidence of RSV infection, and the association between the detection of RSV in the blood and parameters of disease severity was inconclusive. On the other hand, the detection of RSV RNA in the serum of a 2-month old with RSV bronchiolitis was associated with the development of hepatitis, indicating the possible dissemination of RSV in severe forms of the disease [12]. More recently, a study conducted in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with respiratory virus-associated pneumonia showed that compared with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) viral loads, serum RSV, hMPV and influenza virus RNA loads were significantly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation and death, [11]. In the present study, the detection of peripheral blood RSV RNA gradually increased from day 1 to day 5, with detection in 100% of samples on day 5 post-inoculation which correlated with the peak of clinical disease in this model defined by increased airway obstruction.",

Similarly, on days 4 to 6 post-infection the distribution of RSV antigens in the lungs was predominant in alveolar macrophages.

We further documented the presence of RSV by a completely different methodology, and identified a cell subtype, monocytes, bearing RSV antigens in peripheral blood. It is possible that the high RSV inoculum used caused severe lung inflammation and cell damage with subsequent leakage of RSV particles, which may have been engulfed by peripheral blood monocytes. However, the decrease of blood RSV RNA loads after treatment directed against RSV suggests that the detection of RSV RNA in peripheral blood truly reflected the spread of the virus to the systemic compartment. Lastly, the identification of RSV RNA was limited to the respiratory tract and peripheral blood but not to other organs, which could have help to indirectly assess the systemic spread of RSV during the acute infection, and warrants further studies to determine whether other organs are also affected in severe RSV disease.",

At its peak (days 5 to 7), these inflammatory infiltrates extended into surrounding alveolar septa in a stellate manner with patchy involvement of the parenchyma and abundant macrophages, occasional lymphocytes and neutrophils in alveolar spaces. On days 10 and 14 the persistent changes included inflammatory infiltrates located around vessels and airways, consisting of lymphocytes and macrophages, but no neutrophils or eosinophils. Fig 6A.

In contrast, alveolar macrophages' IHC was negative on day 1, occasionally positive on day 3, strong and diffusely stained on days 4 to 6 and decreased by day 7. Both the alveolar epithelium and alveolar macrophages were negative for RSV IHC on days 10 and 14 post-infection. Fig 6B.
