The disease was reported in Guangdong Province, China, in 2002 and spread to more than 30 nations within a few months. Disease severity was linked to age and other comorbidities, with mortality rates increasing with age and exceeding 50% in individuals over 65 y [3]. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier, most likely originating from bats[4\u20136] or from other species including civets, raccoon dogs, domestic cats, swine, and rodents[7]. New zoonotic variants may emerge as evidenced by sporadic cases of human disease in late 2003 and early 2004, which arose from strains distinct from that of the epidemic [8]. In 2004, several laboratory-acquired infections were reported, including secondary spread resulting in fatal disease[9]. Given the significant health and economic impact, the development of an effective vaccine strategy that is protective against both epidemic and zoonotic SARS-CoV strains is highly desirable.",

            "text": "Attenuated and killed SARS-CoV, DNA, and viral vectored vaccines are being evaluated in a number of animal models including mouse, ferret, hamster, and primate [10\u201323], and have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is the principal component of protective immunity [15,24,25]. Although strong immune responses are elicited against both S glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (N) protein [10,15,26,27], passive transfer studies have illustrated that only anti-S antibody confers protection from SARS-CoV replication in the mouse model [16,17,28]. Vaccine development faces a series of potential concerns including reversion or recombination repair of attenuated vaccine strains, induction of immune-mediated enhancement of pathology, waning immune protection, lack of cross-protection for heterologous strains, and limited vaccine efficacy within senescent populations. Furthermore, immune enhancement has been demonstrated with another coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus [29], and more recently with a modified vaccinia vector expressing SARS-S that exacerbated hepatitis in ferrets while failing to protect from infection [30]. Notably, some antibodies against the epidemic Urbani strain increased the infectivity of lentiviruses pseudotyped with an animal SARS-S glycoprotein in an in vitro model, raising the specter of vaccine-mediated immune enhancement of disease following heterotypic challenge [31]. Another potential problem is that SARS vaccines might fail to induce antibodies that protect from infection with divergent strains of SARS-CoV. The S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV contains about 2%\u201320% amino acid variation between zoonotic and the 2003 epidemic strains [8,31], possibly limiting the effectiveness of monotypic SARS-S vaccines. Finally, studies measuring the duration of protective immunity or vaccine efficacy in animals greater than 4 mo post-boost have not yet been reported [17].",

We tested whether the senescent mouse model, which exhibits an age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV similar to that seen in the human disease [32], will provide a sensitive measure of vaccine efficacy and reveal potential complications in SARS-CoV vaccine development for vulnerable elderly populations. We evaluated the duration of protective immunity following homologous and heterologous SARS virus challenge, examining the impact of waning immunity on long-term protection. Through the use of publicly available SARS-CoV sequence databases, bioinformatics approaches, synthetic biology, and reverse genetics, we constructed a viable heterologous challenge virus to test the ability of current vaccine regimens to protect against zoonotic strains; the likely source of future epidemics [8].",

Five-week-old BALB/c mice were vaccinated with 105 IU of VRP-HA, VRP-S, VRP-N, or a combination of VRP-S and VRP-N (VRP-S+N), and boosted 5 wk later. Fifty-four weeks post-boost, mice were i.n. challenged with 105 pfu of icSARS-CoV and lungs removed 4 d post-infection (summarized in Table 1, experiment 2). Although day 2 post-challenge demonstrates peak viral titers, day 4 was chosen to harvest lungs because it is the time at which the highest level of pathology is evident in senescent mice [32]. Titers in the lungs (Figure 2B) of animals vaccinated with VRP-S or the combination of VRP-S+N were below the limit of detection (250 pfu/g). In contrast, the lung titers of VRP-HA\u2013vaccinated animals were 5.8 \u00b1 0.6 log10 pfu/g, comparable to the VRP-N\u2013vaccinated animal titers of 5.3 \u00b1 0.6 log10 pfu/g (p = 0.2). These plaque assay results were confirmed by SARS-CoV\u2013specific in situ hybridization on lung tissues from the infected mice (Figure 2C). Radiolabeled riboprobes complementary to the SARS-CoV N gene were hybridized to sectioned lungs of five mice from VRP-HA, VRP-N, VRP-S, or VRP-S+N vaccinated groups.

Both VRP-S and the combination of VRP-S+N provided complete long-term protection against challenge with the homologous vaccine strain of SARS-CoV at 4 d post-infection (p < 0.001, Fisher exact test for both VRP-S- and VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated groups relative to VRP-HA).",

            "text": "To perform cross-protection efficacy studies, it was necessary to construct a heterologous SARS-CoV. Selection of a likely candidate strain was made after Bayesian analysis of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, which demonstrated three main phylogenetic branches. Two of the branches include viruses isolated from animals, such as the palm civet and raccoon dog, and low pathogenic viruses sporadically isolated from humans, such as GDO3 and GZ0401.Viruses representing the 2003 early, middle, and late phases of the epidemic strains form the third branch in the SARS-S phylogenetic tree (Figure 3A). We resurrected the S glycoprotein of GDO3, a virus reported from a sporadic SARS case on December 22, 2003. Although GDO3 was not successfully isolated, its S glycoprotein was sequenced and reported. Compared to epidemic strains, GDO3 likely represented an independent introduction, was reported to be less pathogenic, and its S glycoprotein sequence is among the most divergent of all human strains [8]. The GDO3-S glycoprotein contains 17 amino acid changes relative to Urbani-S (Figure 3B), many of which map within neutralizing epitopes between amino acids 130\u2013150 and 318\u2013510, part of the receptor binding domain (RBD) [41,43\u201350]. Importantly, polyclonal antibody directed against the late-phase Urbani strain was less effective at neutralizing pseudotyped viruses bearing GDO3-S glycoproteins than those bearing Urbani-S [31]. The Urbani-S glycoprotein was removed from the SARS-CoV molecular clone, replaced with a synthetic cDNA encoding the GD03-S sequence, and used to generate recombinant virus [34]. Sequence analysis of plaque-purified icGDO3-S recombinant virus confirmed the presence of the GDO3-S glycoprotein and two additional changes in the S gene relative to Urbani-S (F7L and D613G), which likely arose as tissue-culture adaptations. The chimeric icGDO3-S, which only differs from Urbani SARS-CoV in its S glycoprotein, and wild-type icSARS-CoV recombinant viruses replicated in Vero cells to comparable titers that approached 107 PFU/ml within 24 h (unpublished data) and their proteins were both detected in Western blots with human antiserum from convalescent patients (Figure 1B). Given the reduced amount of N present in the lysate of icGDO3-S\u2013infected cells, the reduced intensity of the GDO3-S band probed with either anti\u2013VRP-S mouse sera or the convalescent human serum is most likely due to the presence of lower GDO3-S protein rather than a marked difference in antibody specificity between GDO3-S and Urbani-S. icGD03-S replicated efficiently in HAE cells, although its maximum titer was approximately 1 log lower than that of icSARS or Urbani (Figure 3C). To compare the growth of icSARS and icGDO3-S in animals, 6-wk-old BALB/c mice were i.n. infected with 105 pfu of either icSARS or icGDO3-S. At 2 d post-infection, icSARS-CoV mean lung titer was 6.8 \u00b1 0.5 log10 pfu/g, whereas icGDO3-S titers were lower at 6.3 \u00b1 0.2 log10 pfu/g (p = 0.04). The mean lung titer of icSARS-CoV\u2013infected mice on day 4 was 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 log10 pfu/g compared to icGDO3-S titers of 3.7 \u00b1 0.3 (p = 0.04). By the seventh day, virus replication in the lungs of three of five mice infected with icSARS-CoV and four of five mice infected with icGDO3-S fell below the limit of detection (50 pfu/g). Average icSARS-CoV and icGDO3-S titers were similar on day 7 with 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 log10 pfu/g and 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 log10 pfu/g (p = 0.9), respectively (Figure 3D).",

Plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) of serum samples harvested prior to vaccination showed no neutralization of icSARS-CoV; similar results were noted from serum collected from mice vaccinated with the negative controls, VRP-HA or PBS (unpublished data). The 80% PRNT values (PRNT80), the dilution of serum at which plaque numbers are reduced by 80% relative to virus treated with control sera, for VRP-S\u2013 and VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated animals at 5 and 53 wk post-boost against both icSARS-CoV and icGDO3-S were compared (Figure 5A; Table S1). The mean reciprocal dilutions for the PRNT80 of VRP-S and VRP-S+N against icSARS were measured at 796 \u00b1 307 at 5 wk post-boost and 628 \u00b1 363 at 53 wk. Sera from mice vaccinated with the combination of VRP-S+N had mean reciprocal PRNT80 of 1,091 \u00b1 361 and 370 \u00b1 179 at 5 and 53 wk, respectively. The initial neutralizing response in animals vaccinated with VRP-S and VRP-S+N was similar (p = 0.2 at 5 wk post-boost), and although there was not significant waning of the icSARS-neutralizing activity over the 48-wk period in the VRP-S\u2013vaccinated animals (p = 0.3 Wilcoxin matched pairs signed-rank test), VRP-S+N serum was diminished by about 3-fold (p = 0.03 Wilcoxin matched pairs signed-rank test). All tested sera remained above the lower limit of detection (1:100) and were sufficient to prevent icSARS replication within the lungs of challenged animals (Figure 2B). The neutralizing activity of sera from the vaccinated animals was more effective against the vaccine strain than against heterologous icGDO3-S virus for both sera harvests and vaccine combinations. The reciprocal dilutions for the PRNT80 of the VRP-S samples at 5 wk post-boost were below the limit of detection, whereas two samples of the week 53 bleed were measured above the limit of detection with a mean value of 112 \u00b1 28. The icGDO3-S PRNT80 measurements for VRP-S+N at weeks 5 and 53 post-boost were below the limit of detection with one exception for each time point: one mouse was measured to have a PRNT80 of 124 at 5 wk, for an average titer of 103 \u00b1 8, and another a PRNT80 of 107 at 53 wk post-boost, an average of 101 \u00b1 3.",

Against the vaccine strain, the reciprocal dilutions of the mean PRNT80 were 170 \u00b1 82 with two of six samples falling below the limit of detection for VRP-S mice at 12 wk and 142 \u00b1 65 at 29 wk post-boost with four of six falling below the limit of detection. Sera from the VRP-S+N\u2013inoculated mice had PRNT80 values falling near or below the limit of detection with only one measurable sample at 114, for an average of 103 \u00b1 6 and no icSARS-neutralizing ability detected at week 29. Against icGDO3-S, the VRP-S PRNT80 values were below the limit of detection with the exception of a single VRP-S\u2013vaccinated animal showing a neutralizing titer of 179 at 12 wk post-boost, for an average dilution of 116 \u00b1 35 for the group. Sera harvested from these animals exhibited a marked reduction in neutralizing ability when compared to the response in animals vaccinated when young, even against the vaccine strain (p = 0.008 for VRP-S week 5 versus VPP-S week 12 post-boost; p = 0.006 VRP-S+N week 5 versus VRP-S+N week 12 post-boost). A strong anti\u2013SARS-CoV neutralizing response was not induced by the VRP vaccines when administered to senescent mice.",

ELISA for SARS-S was performed on sera collected prechallenge from the VRP-S\u2013 and VRP-S+N\u2013vaccinated mice of experiments 2 and 4 (Figure 6A). Mice vaccinated young with VRP-S (experiment 2) had an average log10 half-maximum ELISA titer of 2.6 \u00b1 0.6 at 53 wk post-boost, whereas that of the senescent animals was approximately a log lower at 1.5 \u00b1 0.9 at 29 weeks post-boost (p = 0.007). The difference between animals of the two age groups was even more striking when anti-S IgG levels were compared in the VRP-S+N mice. The animals vaccinated young with VRP-S+N had an average titer of 2.6 \u00b1 0.3, whereas the average for senescent animals was at the limit of detection of 0.02 log10 half-maximum ELISA titer. To verify that the reduced ability of the senescent animals to mount specific antibody responses was not limited to the SARS-S antigen; anti-HA IgG titers were compared in mice vaccinated with VRP-HA. The average anti-HA titer of animals vaccinated when young was 4.7 \u00b1 0.2, whereas the titer of the vaccinated senescent mice was approximately one-tenth the size with a mean titer of 3.7 \u00b1 0.8 (p < 0.001).

Though there was some animal-to-animal variation, in general only minor inflammatory changes were observed in the senescent control mice challenged with either icSARS or icGDO3-S (Figures 7C, 8A, and 8B). However, following SARS-CoV challenge in senescent mice, the N-vaccinated groups exhibited more marked bronchiolitis and alveolitis, as well as a conspicuous perivascular and peribronchiolar interstitial accumulation of numerous mononuclear leukocytes (mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells; i.e., lymphoplasmacytic cuffing) and increased numbers of widely scattered eosinophils (Figures 7B, 7C, 8C, and 8D). Upon SARS-CoV challenge, the animals vaccinated with S+N also exhibited a similar, but less severe, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration around pulmonary vessels and bronchiolar airways, although alveolitis and eosinophil infiltration were not a prominent feature in these animals (Figures 7F, 8G, and 8H). The lungs of animals vaccinated with VRP-S were similar to VRP-HA\u2013 or PBS mock-vaccinated animals with minimal lymphoplasmacytic cell accumulations (Figures 7E, 8E, and 8F). Therefore, not only did N vaccination fail to control SARS-CoV replication within the lungs, but N vaccination also resulted in an enhanced immunopathology in the lungs of the senescent animals upon viral challenge.",

Prior to challenge, serum was collected from mice and antigen-specific IgG titered to verify successful transfer. Young mice receiving anti\u2013VRP-HA (n = 4) had a mean ELISA serum titer of 2.8 \u00b1 2.4 log10 OD = 0.2, whereas senescent mice (n = 4) had a 2.9 \u00b1 1.8 log10 OD = 0.2 ELISA titer.

Inoculation of mice with VRP-S induced antibody that recognized the epidemic SARS-CoV S glycoprotein as well as the S of a highly divergent strain, GDO3. The VRP-S vaccine induced long-term protection against challenge with the vaccine strain, complete short-term protection against icGDO3-S challenge, and partial protection against the divergent virus in the senescent mouse model. In contrast, vaccination with VRP-N failed to inhibit viral replication within the lungs of either young or senescent animals, resulted in enhanced immunopathology following viral challenge, and did not provide any measurable benefit when combined with VRP-S. The data suggest that vaccine regimens eliciting complete protection against antigenically heterologous forms of SARS-CoV in healthy individuals may not be sufficient for higher risk groups, including vulnerable elderly populations, and that there is a need for further testing of candidate vaccines that induce an anti-N response.",

In humans, neutralization titers have been measured from 1:12 to 1:512 with a geometric mean titer of 1:61 [52]. In a study evaluating an inactivated virus vaccine, neutralizing antibody titers greater than 1:114 resulted in complete protection against challenge [21]. Mice inoculated with vesicular stomatitis virus vectors expressing SARS-S developed lower average neutralizing titers of 1:32, which were nevertheless protective against SARS-CoV infection for up to 4 mo after vaccination [17]. We followed animals for over 1 y after boost. To our knowledge, these are the first assays illustrating waning immune responses to a SARS-CoV candidate vaccine. On average, mice vaccinated when young with VRP-S did not show a significant reduction in neutralizing titers up to 53 wk post-boost, whereas mice vaccinated with the combination of VRP-S+N experienced about a 3-fold reduction over the same period of time. Although it is problematic to compare our neutralizing antibody titers to those induced by other SARS vaccines due to the use of different assays, we demonstrate protection from challenge with either vaccine or heterologous challenge virus strains in animals with an icSARS PRNT80 greater than 1:114, near the assay's limit of detection. Vaccines that induce robust neutralizing titers against the homologous strain will likely confer protection against zoonotic reintroductions, especially in younger populations.",

            "text": "As reported with other SARS-N\u2013expressing DNA and vectored vaccines [15,24], VRP-N did not protect mice from SARS-CoV replication, and no benefit to vaccination with a cocktail of both VRP-S and VRP-N was observed, although an approximately half-log reduction in viral titers within the lungs of some VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice was occasionally observed. Although any reduction in SARS-CoV titer can be interpreted as a positive aspect of a potential vaccine, given the relationship between viral titer and SARS disease severity [53,54], the increased number of lymphocytic and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates, which are also characteristic of the immune pathology observed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection following vaccination with formalin-inactivated RSV [55,56], raises concerns that vaccination with N alone will not only fail to effectively protect against SARS-CoV replication, but may result in vaccine-enhanced pulmonary disease [57]. N-induced pathology has not been previously reported, probably because most studies examined young mice at 2\u20133 d post-infection, prior to the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lung. VRP-N\u2013induced pathology was clearly evident by day 4 and persisted for 1\u20132 wk following wild-type virus challenge, suggesting the potential for serious complications in lung physiology and function. This finding has particular significance for SARS-N and inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines currently under development that also induce anti-N antibody and T cell responses [12,19,21,26,58\u201361], because they may lead to adverse effects. Therefore, caution is merited with respect to the inclusion of SARS-CoV N protein in any vaccine formulation. The passive transfer of anti-N antibody did not contribute to inflammation and leads us to hypothesize that it is the activity of SARS-N\u2013specific T cells in the absence of effective neutralizing anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibody that mediates the adverse response. It is interesting that a Th2\u2013skewed cytokine profile is a hallmark of the RSV vaccine-enhanced disease, which raises the possibility that the N-specific immune response is skewed in a similar manner [62].",

Consequently, most available experimental strains, like Urbani, are nearly identical and do not reflect natural diversity [63,64]. Recent advances in synthetic biology used to reconstruct extinct viruses, or specific genes of those viruses, de novo from their nucleotide sequences [65\u201367] provide the means for expanding the number of available SARS-CoV test strains. Using a comprehensive SARS-CoV genetic database [8,31], we resurrected the divergent GDO3-S glycoprotein in the Urbani genetic backbone. The icGD03-S recombinant virus was identical to the molecular clone except for the presence of two mutations in S that likely evolved after transfection of full-length RNA and virus passage in Vero cells, similar to the cell culture adaptations reported in S for other SARS-CoV strains isolated from human clinical specimens and passaged in vitro [68]. The icGDO3-S CoV's sequence divergence from Urbani, efficient in vitro replication in HAE and Vero cultures, and robust in vivo replication in the mouse model, make it an excellent heterologous challenge inoculum for vaccine studies. The GD03 RBD is also present in many zoonotic isolates described in civets and raccoon dogs, supporting its use as a zoonotic model strain [8]. Furthermore, the reduced replication in HAE cultures of icGDO3-S compared to Urbani-CoV is consistent with the reduced pathogenesis noted in the GDO3 human case [8,53,54].",

            "text": "Consistent with previous work comparing the susceptibility of pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the S glycoproteins of various SARS strains to neutralization by anti-S (Urbani) IgG [31], anti\u2013VRP-S antibody demonstrated reduced neutralization of icGDO3-S relative to the vaccine strain. In spite of this, the VRP-S vaccine successfully provided short-term protection against the divergent virus. Vaccination of senescent animals produced significantly reduced antibody responses compared with younger mice, and when challenged with the heterologous icGDO3-S virus, protection was incomplete. However, any animal with a PRNT80 value above 1:114 against icSARS showed reduced viral replication within the lungs following challenge with either the vaccine or icGDO3-S strains. As noted for the homologous challenge studies, the combination of VRP-S+N did not enhance protection from heterologous challenge, but may actually have weakened it, with senescent animals showing even lower anti-S antibody responses and an even higher rate of viral replication, albeit with reduced titers, and increased lung pathology. One possible cause for vaccine failure is the emergence of an escape mutant in an environment of suboptimal neutralization. However, initial data comparing the neutralization susceptibility of viruses isolated from these mice to the challenge stock refute this conjecture (unpublished data). Incomplete protection by a vaccine in immunosenescent animals and humans is well documented and is more likely the result of an age-related compromise in one or more stages of the immune response to the vaccine. For instance, antibody responses in the immunosenescent tend to offer less protection with limited switching to secondary isotypes, lower antibody levels in general, and production of antibody with lower affinities [69\u201374]. Although we have not tested single-vaccine dose regimens, previous studies have demonstrated that these are efficacious against SARS-CoV challenge in young animals [17]. Given the low antibody titers following boost in senescent populations, single-vaccine dose formulations will likely prove ineffective. Rather, improving the VRP-S efficacy in older vaccinees may require additional vaccine boosts, the use of adjuvants, or other additional therapies [75]. Another likely contributing factor to vaccine failure in older animals was the resistance of icGDO3-S to neutralization relative to the vaccine strain, icSARS-CoV. At least three neutralizing sites have been identified in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, two of which map at the N-terminus and in the RBD of the S glycoprotein, and one to a weak third site near the carboxy-terminus of S. Given that most of the GD03 mutations map in and around the N-terminus and RBD in S1 [31], it is possible that either one or both of these critical epitopes are significantly different in icGD03-S, and likely explains the resistance to neutralization with antisera against Urbani-S. These data suggest that robust neutralizing titers should be induced by candidate vaccines to provide long-term protection from SARS-CoV infection, especially in the vulnerable senescent population and against heterologous strains.",

            "text": "Earlier work had indicated that antibodies to the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV enhanced the in vitro infectivity of pseudotyped viruses bearing the S glycoprotein of zoonotic strains, primarily with strains SZ16 and SZ3, and raised the specter of S-vaccine\u2013induced complications with newly emergent strains [31]. In contrast, it was shown that monoclonal, but not polyclonal, antibodies that neutralized the epidemic strain may enhance the infectivity of pseudotyped viruses bearing GD03-S glycoproteins, although the enhanced infection was marginal at best [31]. Our research with antibody directed against Urbani-S indicated that the polyclonal antibody neutralized icGD03-S on Vero cells, although less efficiently than the vaccine strain, which is consistent with the previous report [31]. Moreover, in the young and senescent mouse models, VRP-S\u2013vaccinated animals challenged with homologous or heterologous icGD03-S recombinant viruses did not display vaccine-mediated enhancement of virus replication or enhanced pathology. Because VRP-S vaccines induce broad neutralizing antibody responses that likely target multiple epitopes across the S glycoprotein, it is possible that the noted enhancement of infectivity with monoclonal antibodies is nullified. Indeed, recent work showed that antibody specific for the RBD of Tor-2\u2013S, GDO3\u2013S, and SZ3\u2013S glycoproteins did not reproduce enhanced infectivity in pseudotyped viruses bearing SZ3-S and identified conserved epitopes that allowed all three strains to be effectively neutralized, raising hope that a single vaccine could be effective against widely divergent strains of SARS-CoV [76]. Clearly, additional studies are needed with more heterologous strains in alternative animal models before the possibility of vaccine-induced enhancement of infection and pathology can be discounted.",

Furthermore, the VRP-S vaccination of young animals protected against challenge with a divergent strain of SARS-CoV, indicating that current vaccines may also provide protection from many zoonotic strains that might emerge in the future. Such cross protection has been observed among other vaccines, such as HA formulations for influenza virus [77] and VRP vaccines against norovirus [78].

The young mouse model provides readily available animals on a homogenous genetic background and efficient replication within the respiratory tract. The senescent mouse model adds the benefit of enhanced pathogenesis and mimicks the age-related susceptibility seen in humans [32]. Although aging decreases B and T cell immunity and innate immune function in humans and mice, characterization of these immune deficiencies is incomplete in both species. SARS-CoV infection in senescent mice provides a key model to evaluate the mechanisms by which aging deters immune responsiveness to highly pathogenic emerging viruses like SARS-CoV and influenza virus, and develop key intervention approaches to enhance vaccine efficacy in the elderly. The expense and limited availability of other senescent species makes the mouse model invaluable.",

Our model systems provide a means for identifying the host factors that contribute to immune senescence and will allow us to evaluate whether changes in vaccine design or regimen will improve vaccine efficacy in senescent animals. The models provide clear rational to test candidate SARS vaccines in the hamster, ferret, and primate models in which pathology and clinical disease are more prominent following wild-type virus challenge. Our research provides a model for future experiments designed to characterize the components and inducers of the VRP-N\u2013enhanced pulmonary inflammation, and suggests that vaccine regimens that contain N protein should be used with caution in human populations until further testing. The successful resurrection of a novel recombinant SARS challenge virus bearing zoonotic S glycoproteins suggests that it might be feasible to reconstruct other rare zoonotic SARS-CoVs that have never been successfully cultured, providing novel challenge viruses for vaccine and therapeutic drug testing against potential future zoonotic SARS introductions into human populations. Finally, these studies should encourage the development of senescent animal models of human disease and encourage vaccine testing and design against influenza, West Nile virus, and other pathogens that produce disproportionate disease burdens in the elderly [80,81].",

At day 2 post-infection (A) and (B), eosinophils are rarely evident in the lungs of either VRP-HA (A) or VRP-N (B) mice. Day 4 post-infection (C) and (D), extensive eosinophils (yellow arrows) are present within the lungs of VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice. Widespread eosinophils are seen at day 7 post-challenge in VRP-N\u2013vaccinated (F), but not VRP-HA\u2013vaccinated (E) mice. By day 14 (G) and (H), eosinophils are rarely found among inflammatory cells of VRP-N\u2013vaccinated mice.
