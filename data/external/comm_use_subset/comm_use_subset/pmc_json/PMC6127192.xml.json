IFN signaling activates the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode known effector proteins that inhibit various stages of the viral life cycle. Although the first antiviral ISGs were discovered several decades ago, effector characterization has so far been limited to a subset of proteins. Recent advances in systematic screening strategies have accelerated discovery of novel antiviral ISGs1\u20134. These screens have also revealed that a smaller subset of ISGs enhance viral infectivity through uncharacterized mechanisms.",

LY6E belongs to the LY6/uPAR superfamily, which consists of multiple proteins containing eight to ten cysteines that form a highly conserved, three-finger folding motif through disulfide bonding6. The LY6/uPAR superfamily is diverse and includes numerous LY6 proteins, complement regulatory protein CD59, and lipoprotein binding protein GPIHBP17,8. Like most LY6 family members, LY6E localizes to the cell surface via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment9. Previous studies implicate LY6E in modulation of cell signaling10\u201312, as well as a potential role in host susceptibility to viral infection13\u201317. LY6E has recently been shown to promote viral entry and replication of HIV-118 and an early step of the virus life cycle for West Nile virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus19. However, it remains unclear how LY6E enhances infectivity of other RNA viruses.",

In mechanistic studies using influenza A virus as a model, we find that LY6E enhances viral uncoating after endosomal escape. Evolutionary analyses coupled with structure-function studies indicate conservation of enhancement by specific protein domains. We conclude that LY6E belongs to a growing class of IFN-inducible factors that broadly enhance viral infectivity in an IFN-independent manner.",

            "text": "In screens to identify ISGs that modulate viral infection, we previously showed that ectopic expression of human LY6E by lentiviral transduction enhanced the infectivity of multiple, genetically diverse viruses. These include members of the Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV)), Togaviridae (Chikungunya virus, O\u2019nyong nyong virus (ONNV)), Retroviridae (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)) and Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A virus (IAV), strain PR8) families1,2,5. Here, we confirmed that in immortalized human STAT1-/- fibroblasts, lentiviral-mediated LY6E expression enhanced the infectivity of the fluorescent reporter virus YFV-17D-Venus after 24 h, or approximately one replication cycle (Fig. 1a). We used STAT1-/- fibroblasts as these cells are unable to respond to IFN, thus allowing us to study LY6E independent of other IFN-inducible ISGs. To determine whether LY6E has effects beyond the first viral replication cycle, we infected LY6E-expressing cells with a low dose of YFV-17D-Venus and quantified the percentage of infected cells over time by flow cytometry. At every time point, we observed enhanced infection in LY6E cells as compared to control cells expressing either firefly luciferase (fluc) or empty vector control (Fig. 1b, c). The most striking difference in infection was a 300% increase observed at 36 h post-infection, after the onset of viral spread. At this time point, we observed an increase in the percentage of infected cells expressing low levels of Venus, as reflected by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the fluorescent reporter. Since newly infected cells express lower levels of viral antigens and virally encoded Venus, our data suggest that these cells were recently infected with virus that was at an early stage of replication. To more precisely determine the effect of ectopic LY6E expression on virus production, we quantified the amount of a non-reporter virus (YFV-17D) secreted into cell supernatants over time by plaque assay (Fig. 1d). We consistently found that compared to empty vector control cells, cells ectopically expressing LY6E produced at least twice as much virus. Together, these time course studies indicate that LY6E enhances infection within the first viral replication cycle, which correlates with more rapid viral spread and overall increased virus production.",

We further validated our previous screening data, suggesting that ectopic LY6E expression does not universally enhance infectivity of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses, as Sindbis virus (SINV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and measles virus (MV) were not affected2. Additionally, we observed no enhancement of a replication-defective adenovirus serotype 5 vector (AdV5), which is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus (Fig. 1f).

We observed a robust phenotype in wild-type (WT) immortalized human fibroblasts (HuFibr) and a moderate enhancement in a human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The strong enhancement phenotype in both WT and STAT1-/- human fibroblasts indicates that the LY6E phenotype is independent of STAT1-mediated signaling. Ectopic LY6E expression in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549), human hepatoma cells (Huh7.5), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), or Syrian baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) did not enhance YFV (Supplementary Fig. 1a). LY6E overexpression in the monocytic cell line THP-1 also enhanced susceptibility to IAV (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We examined basal and IFN-induced protein expression of LY6E to determine whether we could discern a pattern underlying cell type dependency. Basal LY6E expression is detectable by Western blot in STAT1-/- fibroblasts, HuFibr, U2OS, A549, and HEK293T. Basal expression is not observed in THP-1 or Huh7.5. Treatment with IFN\u03b1 induced LY6E in THP-1, HuFibr, U2OS, and A549, but had no effect on protein expression in Huh7.5 or HEK293T. As expected, no induction was observed in STAT1-/- fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Overall, our data indicate that LY6E promotes viral infectivity in a cell type-specific manner, with the strongest phenotype in cells of fibroblast and monocytic lineages. This cell-type specificity appears unrelated to endogenous or IFN-inducible levels of LY6E.",

We performed phylogenetic analysis of several LY6/uPAR family member proteins of similar size and localization to LY6E (Fig. 2a, Table 1). While all LY6/uPAR family members share a highly conserved three-finger tertiary structure, only a maximum of 49.64% similarity in primary amino acid sequence is observed between LY6E and its nearest neighbor, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA). To test whether other LY6/uPAR family members enhance viral infection, we generated lentivirus encoding LY6 family members and transduced STAT1-/- fibroblasts with a dose response of viral particles, with input normalized by p24 ELISA. Only PSCA enhanced infection of YFV-17D-Venus, while the expression of family members with less shared identity had no effect (Fig. 2b). Notably, PSCA was classified as a hit in a genome-wide siRNA knockdown screen to identify host factors important for WNV infection13. Our results suggest that a common sequence or structure shared by LY6E and PSCA, but not other family members, may underlie the viral enhancement phenotype.",

Loss of endogenous LY6E did not alter the protective dose-dependent effect of IFN pre-treatment on YFV infection. Additionally, calculated IC50 values were similar in both cell backgrounds (Supplementary Fig. 3b). At increasing doses of IFN, viral enhancement by endogenous LY6E was lost, likely due to IFN-mediated induction of antiviral ISGs that masked the enhancement phenotype. Accordingly, IFN-induced expression of antiviral ISGs previously shown to inhibit YFV was unchanged between LY6E KO and control cells, further demonstrating that LY6E-mediated viral enhancement is independent of the type I IFN response (Supplementary Fig. 3c)1. This data is corroborated by IFN-stimulated response element reporter studies2.

For viruses that belong to the Rhabdoviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae families, fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane is triggered by acidic pH29. To assess whether LY6E enhances endosomal escape, we used IAV labeled with lipophilic dye octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) at a concentration that results in self-quenching of the fluorescent signal. Upon fusion with the host endosomal membrane, R18 becomes diluted to the point of de-quenching, which results in a measurable fluorescent signal28. Pre-treatment with bafA, which blocks endosomal acidification, resulted in attenuated IAV fusion. Endosomal escape was equivalent in LY6E KO and WT U2OS, indicating that LY6E does not enhance endosomal escape of IAV (Fig. 5d).",

To assess the effect of LY6E expression on uncoating, we incubated STAT1-/- fibroblasts with 25 MOI IAV at 4 \u00b0C to synchronize infection. After 1 h, unbound virus was aspirated and cells were shifted to 37 \u00b0C in the presence of cycloheximide to prevent translation of nascent M1 protein. As a control, we also treated cells with a combination of bafA and cycloheximide to block endosomal escape and thus prevent uncoating. Cells were harvested at 1, 2, and 4 h post-infection and stained with HB64. The percentage of cells with a bright M1 signal was assessed by flow cytometry. Ectopic expression of LY6E increased the percentage of M1-positive cells relative to control, indicating that LY6E promotes IAV uncoating (Fig. 5g). When both LY6E and control cells were treated with bafA, fewer cells were identified as M1-positive. This reduction in M1-positive cells is consistent with M1 antigen from acid-exposed, uncoated IAV being more accessible to HB64 than M1 antigen from endosomal IAV.",

Each genome segment is associated with nucleoprotein (NP), to form vRNP. By staining for NP and nuclei, we can distinguish cytoplasmic and nuclear vRNPs after addition of bafA (Fig. 5h). We batch-compared ten thousand infected STAT1-/- fibroblasts expressing LY6E or empty vector control for NP translocation into the nucleus. A low similarity score indicates cytoplasmic restriction of NP, whereas a high similarity score indicates NP has completely translocated into the nucleus. When cells were pre-treated with bafA, STAT1-/- fibroblasts expressing LY6E or fluc control had identical similarity scores, confirming that inhibition of endosomal acidification blocks viral escape and nuclear import of vRNP. When bafA was added as early as 10 min post-infection, a greater number of LY6E-expressing cells had nuclear vRNP as compared to control cells. By 2 h, most LY6E-expressing cells showed complete overlay of NP and nuclear signals, indicating that the LY6E enhancing effect results in increased NP import into the nucleus (Fig. 5i, j). Because vRNP translocation is downstream of viral uncoating, we hypothesize that the enhancement observed in the ImageStream assay is likely a result of the uncoating phenotype, though we cannot rule out that LY6E may also directly affect vRNP nuclear import. Further experimentation in which uncoating is uncoupled from vRNP nuclear translocation would be needed to distinguish these possibilities.",

First, we performed phylogenetic analysis on LY6E orthologs from seven mammalian families (Supplementary Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 1). While LY6E is well conserved in primates, we observed a 24% or greater decrease in amino acid identity and 15% or greater decrease in amino acid similarity when comparing human LY6E to non-primate orthologs. We tested for conservation of the LY6E-mediated viral enhancement phenotype by using orthologs representing diverse mammalian families. We expressed LY6E from Cercopithecidae (Macaca mulatta or rhesus macaque), Pteropodidae (Pteropus alecto or black flying fox), and Muridae (Mus musculus or house mouse) in human STAT1-/- fibroblasts and compared enhancement of YFV-17D-Venus to that of human LY6E. All orthologs enhanced infection by YFV-17D-Venus relative to the control when expressed in a heterologous cell type (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, expression of both human LY6E and the M. musculus ortholog Ly6e in murine fibroblasts (3T3) enhanced YFV-17D-Venus infectivity relative to the control (Fig. 6b). Expression of the murine ortholog in LY6E KO U2OS partially restored viral infectivity (Fig. 6c). Collectively, our analyses reveal that viral enhancement by LY6E is functionally conserved in diverse mammals.",

Analogous regions of other LY6/uPAR family members have previously been shown to be functionally important for intermolecular interactions34,35. Because LY6E orthologs from mouse, rhesus macaque, and bat enhanced YFV-17D-Venus infectivity to the same effect as the human protein, we hypothesized that conserved residues shared by the four orthologs may be important for the viral phenotype. We identified nine loop residues of interest within blocks of amino acids that resulted in a loss of phenotype as shown in Fig. 7b, including blocks 4, 9, 10, and 11 (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Fig. 5a, arrows indicate mutated residues). The mutations were cloned into human LY6E with a HA tag added immediately before the GPI anchored serine at position 101 (S101), and the resulting HA-tagged mutants were expressed in STAT1-/- fibroblasts by lentiviral transduction. Input lentivirus was normalized between mutants by p24 ELISA. A partial loss of viral phenotype was observed with I57A. A complete loss of phenotype occurred with L36A, which fully recapitulated the loss of phenotype observed with mutagenesis of block 4 (Fig. 7c). To test whether these point mutations affected cell surface localization and protein expression, we used immunofluorescence and Western blotting to examine expression of the HA epitope. The point mutations had no effect on localization to the cell surface when compared to WT LY6E-HA (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Several mutations, including L33A, L36A, N59A, and G64A reduced protein expression as detected by Western blot for HA epitope (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Increasing protein expression of the L36A mutant by transducing with a greater amount of lentivirus did not rescue the viral phenotype relative to WT LY6E, indicating the loss of phenotype is not due to impaired LY6E expression or stability (Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 5d). L36 was also required for enhancement of IAV, further demonstrating the importance of this residue (Fig. 7e). Overall, these structure-function analyses reveal L36 as an evolutionarily conserved residue that is important for LY6E expression and is essential for viral enhancement.",

We further show that LY6E expression also increases the rate at which IAV enters cells as measured by NP translocation into the nucleus, which may be dependent on enhancement of uncoating (Fig. 5j).",

            "text": "What factors contribute to the specificity of LY6E-mediated viral enhancement? We demonstrate here that LY6E promotes infection by several viral families, but that the phenotype does not extend to all enveloped viruses. This selectivity may be due to differences in both entry strategies and dependence on host machinery. As a small cell surface protein lacking a cytoplasmic tail, we hypothesize that LY6E requires interaction with other plasma membrane-associated proteins to confer activity. The flexible three-finger motif may allow multiple interacting partners depending on cellular context, as has been previously demonstrated with the T cell receptor in lymphocytes36, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor37, or syncytin-A38. Dependence on an interacting partner may also explain our observation in Supplementary Fig. 1a that the viral enhancement phenotype is absent in certain cell backgrounds. Furthermore, while we found LY6E expression to enhance VSV infection in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts, another group observed inhibition of VSV when LY6E was expressed in HEK293T kidney cells3. We found that LY6E expression neither enhances nor inhibits YFV infection in HEK293T (Supplementary Fig. 1a), leading us to hypothesize that the viral phenotype of LY6E is variable depending on cell background and virus. This hypothesis may also help explain the diverse effects attributed to LY6E, such as attenuating T cell receptor signaling10, suppressing responsiveness to LPS stimulation14, or supporting proper placental formation38,39. As an IFN-inducible gene, the diverse functions of LY6E suggest that it may have pleiotropic effects that depend on cellular context.",

Several ISGs that possess strong antiviral activity against diverse viruses can also be co-opted to promote infection by specific pathogens. IFITM3, which potently blocks entry of a broad range of viruses such as IAV, DENV, HIV-1, and Ebola virus (EBOV), can be used by human coronavirus OC43 as an entry factor40,41. Viperin, which can be induced by several viruses independently of IFN, blocks viral egress or replication of multiple viruses such as IAV, HIV-1, and DENV, but has also been shown to interact with human cytomegalovirus to enhance its infection42,43. ISGs with regulatory function but without antiviral activity have also been co-opted to promote infection of specific viruses, such as suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which can bind to EBOV protein VP40 to facilitate egress44. The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is an example of an ISG that enhances infectivity by multiple viruses45\u201348, but is also essential for cellular antiviral immunity by contributing to dendritic cell (DC) maturation. Axl\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to IAV and WNV infection, indicating that the defect in DC maturation overshadows the effects of viral hijacking49.",

            "text": "In an alternate model to viral hijacking, LY6E may serve to promote viral uptake in certain cell types to accelerate or amplify innate and possibly downstream adaptive immune responses. This model would be consistent with data indicating that LY6E is ubiquitously expressed in multiple human tissues21, and has been detected in multiple subsets of murine and human immune cells, both basally9,50,51 and in response to IFN14,20. Identification of LY6E as a signature ISG that is upregulated in samples from IAV-infected patients suggests a potential role in host immunity52. Murine Ly6e was also identified by an in vivo RNAi screen as a potential contributor to the murine antiviral response to IAV, making an intriguing case for further study of LY6E in the context of an intact immune system53. Our evolutionary analyses indicate functional conservation of the viral enhancement phenotype across distinct LY6E orthologs, which suggests a potentially beneficial role for the host. Whole body ablation of Ly6e has been reported to be embryonic lethal in mice due to defective placental formation39,54; therefore, we propose that mouse models in which Ly6e expression is ablated in specific cell types will be critical for testing complex models that are less tractable in cell culture systems.",

SD is shown. b, c were analyzed before normalization by repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparison test relative to WT LY6E. For d, ratio paired t-test was used to compare L36A and LY6E at equivalent doses of lentivirus prior to data normalization. Data for e were analyzed prior to normalization by repeated measures one-way ANOVA with Holm Sidak\u2019s multiple comparison test relative to WT LY6E",
