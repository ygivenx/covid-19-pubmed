            "text": "To investigate the regulation of lncRNAs during viral infection, a cohabitation challenge was used to infect S. salar with a highly virulent ISAV strain (HPR7b). According to Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival, the different survival rates between trojans and cohabitants were not significant in relation to the lifetime of the fish. Samples were taken at the beginning of the challenge (T0), before any mortalities; at 19 DPC (T1), with the first mortalities; at 23 DPC (T2); and at 30 DPC (T3), when the plateau phase began26. Whole-transcriptome analyses were performed on collected gills, liver, and head-kidney tissues using Illumina sequencing. Directional cDNA libraries were constructed by a MiSeq\u00ae Illumina sequencer, which profiled polyadenylated, coding, and noncoding transcripts, but not small RNAs2627. A large number of reads (193 million) were subjected to quality control filters for the random effects of single slide variability, leaving only transcripts that were either present or marginal in all RNA-Seq experiments. For the filtered reads, de novo assembly was performed, and 193,846 contigs were generated with an N50 value equal to 1,171 and effective mapped reads rate of 84.66%. These contigs were used as reference sequences for the identification of putative lncRNAs in Salmo salar (Fig. 1). The difficulty to characterize the lncRNA landscape in salmon, lack of a robust lncRNA database and the low genome conservation among the fish consequence of the successive genome duplications in teleost, consequently required a several stage processing of the data with specific objectives. The first was removing the protein-coding transcripts (deleting transcripts that could encode known proteins). As a result, above 70 K contigs were annotated (E-value < 10\u22125) that were discarded from further analysis. Secondly, a highly stringent filter was applied for contig coverage. This filter allows minimizing bias of the de novo assembly and discards contigs with low-coverage (12 k contigs with high coverage <50 reads/pb).",

Secondly we inspected the presence of open reading frames (ORF) >200 and the presence of putative protein conserved domains among all possible translation frames. Based upon the CPC value and the ORF prediction 6 K contigs did not show evidence of coding potential and putative conserved domains within their predicted amino acid sequences. The remaining transcripts were mapped against the latest draft of the S. salar genome to ensure their existence at genomic level. Of this set 5,635 did not show partial overlap of predicted loci and represents potential lncRNAs of S. salar (Supplementary Table S2). Our integrative analysis of transcriptome data by using computational and highly stringent analytical filters suggests that the transcriptional events detected were largely from ncRNAs and that some could be differentially expressed in response to viral infection.",

At 23 DPC, lncRNA abundance peaked in close correlation with an increase in ISAV load, both of which then decreased until the final sample time. These observations suggest that lncRNAs are expressed in a temporal-specific manner. Meanwhile, mRNAs showed a temporal and tissue-specific modulation, novel lncRNAs expression increased during viral challenge. We observed a large number of reads mapped close to protein coding mRNAs (Fig. 3A,B) in samples from virus-infected fish. From the tissues, we obtained that the lncRNAs mapped to host genomic sites, including many that mapped to nonannotated intergenic regions (Fig. 3B; see Table S6 in the supplemental material). We reasoned that the transcriptional activities detected in nonannotated regions were largely from ncRNAs and that were differentially expressed in response to viral infection.",

The threshold of each lncRNA gave enrichment results that were highly dependent upon the cutoff used. Due to this, a more robust, threshold-independent method was used.

Therefore, being less strict about the ORF length provides increased bias in the calculation of the lncRNAs which a rise in false-positive rate4041. In consequence, 5,635 lncRNAs were identified for S. salar (cut-off < 30 amino acids), were classified as novel lncRNAs not previously reported in salmonids.

This finding is in agreement with previous results on monocytes challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide that drives changes in transcriptomic dynamics of lncRNAs suggesting an importance ofthese molecules during the defense response42. In this study, the rapid changes observed in lncRNAs during ISAV infection suggests that the abundance of lncRNAs is highly regulated. During the defense response of S. salar to ISA infection, a highly selective modulation of immune-like mRNAs is required26. Therefore, an intrinsic question is if the turn over rate of lncRNAs is regulated by a mechanism comparable to that regulating the stability of mRNAs during the defense response. Studies of lncRNAs in yeast43 have shown that decapping is a crucial mechanism in regulating the stability of mRNAs, where this decapping promotes the rapid and robust induction of genes associated with galactose utilization. Thus, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNA performance may play an essential role in the transcription of mRNA during the defense response to pathogens.",

Alternatively, some of the downregulated lncRNAs might be highly expressed in control tissues and later stages of infection to maintain homeostasis. Viruses are known to hijack host cellular machinery for viral replication and to suppress antiviral responses through a variety of mechanisms. The relevance of host cell factors during ISAV replication has been previously identified, revealing the involvement of several antiviral networks in ISAV replication2627. This mechanism has been fully characterized in other Orthomyxoviridae, such as IAV4647.

            "text": "Importantly, the diverse responses of the salmon to ISAV infection made it possible to annotate lncRNA functions in the context of viral infection. HPR7b-ISAV infection triggered a wide range of host defense responses associated with significant differences in the magnitude of the transcriptomic response. As previously shown, HPR7b-ISAV infection is able to promote a strong, tissue-specific, antiviral response in antiviral genes Mx1, IRFa, and Viperin26. The present study sheds new light on lncRNAs that may be involved in host defense to ISAV infection. Specifically, seven lncRNAs were highly correlated with antiviral mRNA expression in all of the examined tissues, none of which have been described before. Among these lncRNAs, Ss_lncRNA_4968, Ss_lncRNA_575, and Ss_lncRNA_1421 were significantly upregulated after HPR7b-ISAV infection. The expression of Ss_lncRNA_2198 was highly correlated with ISAV-segment 7 replication in the liver and was positively correlated with GIG2. These results suggest that some lncRNAs might modulate the fish defense response during viral infection, in addition to highlighting the richness of this dataset for future analyses that could generate new hypotheses and understandings on ISA virus pathogenesis and lncRNA functions. To check the sequence conservation of the lncRNAs, we used the synteny block analysis by Ulitsky et al.1. The limited knowledge of lncRNAs sequence in fish restricted the success of this analysis, which displayed a low conservation across different mammalian species1.",

In addition, this study greatly expanded on the existing annotation of lncRNAs in fish and described significant regulation of 5,636 lncRNAs, most of which have not been previously described following ISA virus infection. Taking into consideration the limitations of the genomic information in S. salar (annotation, genomic and chromosome location, DNA scaffolds, etc), we classified the lncRNAs in intronic or promoter region, the results showed that most of the selected lncRNAs were intergenic and, in the case of Ss_lncRNA_4977 and Ss_lncRNA_574, were located tightly linked with innate immune response and antigen presentation genes. However to full characterization of lncRNAs further studies of its molecular basis are required. In agreement with the above in contributing to the general knowledge of lncRNA functions, we expect that this work will aid in experimentally characterising lncRNAs in non-model species. As the function of lncRNAs remains poorly understood in fish, our results become a useful resource for exploring the role of the non-protein coding transcriptome during viral infection. LncRNAs may represent a whole new class of innate immunity signaling molecules50, viral-dependent regulators, or even a new layer of gene expression regulation responsible for modulating host responses during viral infection. Similarly, lncRNAs may also represent a new potential class of biomarkers for infectious diseases. The similar differential regulation of lncRNAs in response to ISA virus infection indicates that lncRNA-based signature of virus infection may exist, suggesting additional diagnostic potential for fish infections. In particular, the mechanistic characterization of lncRNAs belonging to the viral response would have broad impacts in fields as fish immunology. Finally, in the near future, it is likely that detailed knowledge of lncRNA regulation and function will be necessary for fully understanding viral pathogenesis in fish.",
