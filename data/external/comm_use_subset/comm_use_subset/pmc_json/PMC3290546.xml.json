NiV along with Hendra virus (HeV) comprise the new genus Henipavirus (reviewed in [1]). NiV was first identified during an outbreak of severe encephalitis in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998\u201399, with pigs serving as the intermediate amplifying host [2]. Since 1998 NiV has caused regular outbreaks, primarily in Bangladesh and India, with the most recent occurrences at the beginning of 2011 [3]. In the majority of subsequent spillover events, the mortality rate among humans has been higher (\u223c75%) along with evidence of multiple rounds of person-to-person transmission [4], [5], [6].",

As the endothelium forms the primary barrier of the circulatory system, endothelial dysfunction during infection could broadly affect immune cell function by regulating cytokines, chemokines and cell receptors and influencing vascular permeability. To gain new insights into virus-host interaction, we analyzed the transcriptome signature of NiV infection in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Among the ten most strongly upregulated genes 8 h after NiV infection, we identified CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10, IP-10), a chemokine that promotes leukocyte trafficking by acting on T lymphocytes, NK and dendritic cells via its receptor CXCR3 [8]. In addition to its protective role during the viral infection, CXCL10 may enhance the severity of virus infection and cause neuronal apoptosis and calcium dysregulation [9], [10] and enhance autoreactive lymphoproliferation and brain injury [11]. We have confirmed secretion of CXCL10 by NiV-infected HUVECs by ELISA and showed that increased production of CXCL10 follows NIV replication in experimentally infected hamsters. Finally, we demonstrated production of CXCL10 in brain endothelial cells of patients with fatal acute NiV encephalitis. Altogether, these results suggest that CXCL10 may be an important regulator of NiV-induced pathogenesis as well as a potential marker for NiV infection.",

We established the HUVEC cell culture and assessed their purity at passage 2, either by cell immunostaining or flow cytometry using two endothelial-specific markers, Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) stored in cytoplasmic Weibel-Palade bodies, and CD31 (PECAM-1) localized in homophilic intercellular contacts, which gave us reproducibly satisfactory results (Fig. S1). We then analyzed the expression of NiV receptors, production of viral specific RNAs, generation of the cytopatic effect and production of viral particles (Fig. 1). The expression of mRNA specific for NiV entry receptors ephrinB2 and B3 [12], [13], [14] was readily detected in these cells, at levels close to those in the astroglioma cell line U373, which was also highly permissive to NiV infection [15] (Fig. 1C). Production of NiV structural genes coding for nucleoprotein, matrix, fusion protein, glycoprotein and polymerase increased rapidly during the infection, following a gradient characteristic of paramyxoviruses, with highest expression of the first gene represented in the genome, N, and lowest for the gene coding for the polymerase (Fig. 1D). Formation of large syncytia was rapidly detected in HUVECs (Fig. 1B) and the highest level of the production of infectious particles was obtained 24H after infection, as most of the cells were lysed 48 h p.i. in this cell type (Fig. 1E). Therefore, NiV infects rapidly HUVECs and induces a significant cytopathic effect.",

Cells were infected with either NiV or treated with mock preparation and RNA was taken 8 h p.i., to obtain the information about the early changes in NiV-induced gene expression in HUVEC in the conditions when cell viability was still preserved. Among 55.000 analyzed genes, pair-wise comparisons between infected and uninfected samples revealed 807 deregulated genes (fold change cut-off = 1.3). NiV infection down-regulated galectin 3 gene expression, a member of the lectin family, involved in cell adhesion, cell activation and chemoatraction [16], but most of the other down-regulated genes were not found associated with any known function (table 1). The 538 up-regulated genes were classified according to their Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes and molecular functions. This analysis revealed that NiV-infection up-regulated 34 genes implicated in the immune response, particularly those associated with the interferon pathway, including MxA, RIGI, MDA, 2\u20325\u2032-OAS 1 and 2 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, among the top ten up-regulated genes was CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10, IP10), an important chemokine secreted by endothelial cells (table 1). These results have been further confirmed by RT-qPCR at 8 and 24 h post-infection for several genes linked to interferon pathway, including MXA, OAS1, IFN beta and CXCL10 (Fig. 3A). In addition to stimulation of CXCL10, which was observed at different MOI of infection, MOI of 1 as well as 3, the induction of the closely related chemokine CXCL11 (Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant, I-TAC or IP-9), being at 19th position among up-regulated genes, was also confirmed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 3A). However, the production of the third closely related chemokine CXCL9 (MIG), which shares the same receptor CXCR3 with CXCL10 and CXCL11, was not detected. Finally, secretion of CXCL10 by NiV-infected HUVECs was demonstrated by ELISA up to 72 h of infection (Fig. 3B), confirming the NiV infection induces the expression of CXCL10 at the protein level as well.",

Thus, we analyzed whether NiV-infection induces production of CXCL10 in vivo, using the hamster animal model, which closely reproduces human infection and induces lethal outcome starting from day 5 p.i. [17]. Hamsters were infected by NiV and sacrificed on a daily basis for analysis of RNA in different organs (Fig. 4). The baseline expression of CXCL10 was observed in all organs and increased during the course of infection, particularly in brain and kidney. In lung and spleen the level of CXCL10 initially increased, but decreased on the last day that preceded lethal outcome of the infection. The most rapid and highest induction of CXCL10 mRNA expression was observed in the spleen (16 times more than the baseline expression, already 24 h p.i.), which may correlate with the abundance of cells capable of secreting CXCL10 in the spleen (leukocytes, endothelial cells and splenic stromal cells [18]. The highest NiV replication was observed in lungs of infected hamsters. The level of CXCL10 expression significantly correlated to the level of NiV N expression in analysed organs (p<0.001), suggesting that production of this chemokine closely follows the NIV replication.",

CXCL10 expression was intense in the endothelium of cerebral vessels in encephalitic patients (Fig. 5 B\u2013F) and was not observed in the cerebral cortex of non-infected patients (Fig. 5A). Altogether, these results indicated that NiV-infection activates cellular pathways leading to an increase of CXCL10 expression that may play a role in the pathogenesis of this highly lethal emergent infection.",

Our analysis of the transcriptome profile of NiV-infected primary endothelial cells revealed the induction of several genes involved in the interferon type I pathway as well as the overexpression of CXCL10, an important chemoattractant chemokine with proinflammatory activity [19]. Although expression of IFN alpha and beta was shown to be inhibited in human cell lines after NiV infection [20], human primary endothelial cells seem to be resistant to this inhibition [21]. Our study demonstrated that a few other members of interferon type I pathway, including MxA, RIGI, 2\u20325\u2032-OAS 1 and 2, are highly expressed early after NiV infection, suggesting a functional interferon pathway in NiV-infected human endothelial cells.",

Furthermore, it was shown that interferon alpha could also induce CXCL10 in primary cultured neurons [24] and seminiferous tubules [25]. In addition to interferons, HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 was shown to induce expression of CXCL10 in brains of mice [26]. HIV Tat protein can also induce CXCL10 in astrocytes [27]. Furthermore, CXCL10 is expressed early in the CNS in response to a wide variety of viruses [11], [13], [28], [29], [30]. Our results demonstrate that NiV-infection induces rapidly production of CXCL10 in primary endothelial cells. As production of interferon gamma by these cells is contested, it is possible that the generation of CXCL10 is either a direct effect of NiV proteins or is induced via NiV-activation of interferon beta, following infection. Moreover, our results demonstrate induction of CXCL10 in vivo in different organs of NiV-infected hamsters, as well as in patients that succumbed to lethal NiV-infection, thus revealing an important association between NiV-infection and CXCL10 production. Although endothelial cells were clearly secreting this chemokine, the perivascular inflammatory cells and some neurons are most probably participating in the production of CXCL10 as well.",

Therefore, potential effect of CXCL10 in NiV infection could be either beneficial or harmful and the balance between these two effects may be critical for the final outcome of the disease. Infection with RNA viruses that may cause encephalitis in humans, such as HIV or lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, or in rodent models, such as mouse hepatitis virus and Theiler's virus, can directly induce the expression of chemokines by astrocytes and microglia and establish chemokine gradients that promote leukocyte trafficking within the CNS [11], [31], [32], [33]. In addition, neutralization of CXCL10 decreased leukocyte migration to areas of infection in measles virus-infected brain tissue [34]. Although several of these viruses directly infect neurons, these cells have not been observed to participate in the inflammatory response, suggesting the indirect induction of inflammatory response via cytokines. Nevertheless, in a transgenic mouse model of measles virus encephalitis, neuronal expression of CXCL10 was associated with T-cell recruitment, suggesting that neurons may play a role in the induction of immune responses to viral invasion [35]. In recent study Lo et al. showed that NiV infection could induce production of CXCL10 and several other inflammatory chemokines in microvascular, but not in macrovascular endothelial cells [21]. However, in contrast to our study, they cultured endothelial cells in the presence of hydrocortisone, known to have important anti-inflammatory activity and to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [36], which could account to the differences with our results. In accord to our results, NiV was shown to induce CXCL10 expression as well as several other inflammatory chemokines in brain and lungs of NiV infected hamsters [37] suggesting altogether that the other cytokines may contribute to the CXCL10 proinflammatory effect.",

The mechanisms of neuronal injury mediated by the CXCL10 was suggested to be associated to calcium dysregulation during CXCL10 mediated apoptosis [10], and we hypothesize that overexpression of CXCL10 in Nipah-infected patients may be directly involved in NiV-induced neuropathology.

This antagonist form of CXCL10 was very recently shown to play an important role in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus [44] and to present an important negative prognostic marker for the response to therapy [45], [46]. Whether this cleaved antagonist form of CXCL10 is generated during NiV-infection remains to be elucidated. If produced, its action on inhibition of the physiological role of CXCL10, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NiV-encephalitis.",
