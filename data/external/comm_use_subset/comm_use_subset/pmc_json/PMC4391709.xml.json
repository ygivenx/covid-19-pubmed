            "text": "Evidence suggests that CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes play a critical role in controlling human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication. The appearance of virus-specific CD8+ T cells is closely associated with the initial drop in viremia occurring during primary HIV-1 infection [1\u20133], and vaccine-induced effector memory T-cell responses were shown to control pathogenic SIVmac239 replication in rhesus macaques, with some evidence of viral clearance [4,5]. In addition, there appears to be an inverse relationship between HIV-1-specific CD4+ T-cell functions and viral load [6]. In particular, CD4+ T cells have been shown to be implicated in the maintenance of functional memory CD8+ T cells [7,8]. The quality of HIV-1-specific T-cell responses seems to be crucial. Indeed, studies in long-term non-progressors and HIV controllers revealed that the presence of specific, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected patients is associated with long-term non-progressing disease and low viral load [9\u201313]. While the ultimate objective of vaccine development efforts is the generation of a preventive HIV-1 vaccine inducing sterilizing immunity based on protective antibodies, a vaccine that is able to induce potent and polyfunctional T cell-mediated immune responses may also be beneficial in controlling viral replication in the early stages of infection (reviewed in [14,15]).",

However, vaccination regimens using a replication-defective adenovirus serotype 5 vector (Ad5), alone or in prime-boost with DNA, did not reduce HIV-1 acquisition rates or set-point viral loads in clinical trials [24\u201327]. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in the vaccinees, with a predominance of CD8+ T-cell responses. Whether the insufficient magnitude, functionality or breadth of the vaccine-induced cellular immune responses participated in the failure of the Ad5 vaccine to provide demonstrable protection against HIV-1 infection remains unclear. In particular, in the \u2018STEP\u2019 clinical trial, pre-existing Ad5-specific antibody titers appeared to have negatively impacted the HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responder rate after vaccination [26].",

The prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to NHP adenoviruses is markedly lower than that of anti-human adenovirus NAbs [28\u201331]. In particular, the chimpanzee adenovirus type 7 (AdC7) is thought to circulate minimally in human populations, and appears to be able to circumvent cross-neutralization from pre-existing anti-human adenovirus antibodies [32]. The prevalence of NAbs to AdC7 in human populations has been reported to be low in the United States, Uganda and South Africa, with very weak NAb titers when seropositivity was detected [28,31]. Replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral vectors have been shown to elicit potent CD8+ T-cell responses against several transgenes in mice and NHPs [32\u201343]. We therefore hypothesize that low-seroprevalent, replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral vectors could ultimately induce enhanced protective responses against HIV replication in humans, relative to vectors based on human serotypes.",

In contrast to the AdC7-GRN-induced responses, F4/AS01-induced CD4+ T-cell responses persisted at 6 months after the second immunization (Weeks 36 and 28 for the AA and PP groups, respectively).",

While CD8+ T cells have been associated with some control of HIV-1 and SIV replication [4,5,49], CD4+ T cells are implicated in maintaining functional HIV-specific responses of memory CD8+ T cells and antibodies [6\u20138,50]. Developing prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine regimens that are able to elicit balanced T-cell responses consisting of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells might therefore offer a valuable contribution to the antibody-based vaccine strategies. The candidate vaccine F4/AS01 has been shown to induce robust polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell responses in HIV-seronegative volunteers and HIV-1-infected patients on ART, and lower levels of these responses in ART-na\u00efve HIV-1-infected subjects [44\u201346]. The present study in NHP and mice aimed to assess the immunogenicity and functionality of CMI responses induced by heterologous prime-boost regimens using the adjuvanted protein vaccine F4/AS01 and the chimpanzee recombinant adenoviral vector AdC7-GRN. This simian vector was used based on its very low prevalence in humans, and the capacity of adenoviral vectors in general to elicit potent CD8+ T-cell responses. The data generated in the NHP model could facilitate extrapolation to the clinical setting, while the murine data allow for an exploratory characterization of the anatomical localization of the responding T cells induced by the different immunization regimens.",

            "text": "HIV-1-specific CD4+ T-cell responses were primarily driven by F4/AS01. This is in accordance with clinical data, showing that the vaccine induces predominantly CD4+ T-cell responses in humans [44\u201346], and with the fact that AS01 is a potent enhancer of T-cell responses, as demonstrated in various clinical studies with a range of antigens (reviewed in [51,52]). In contrast to vaccine antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell responses, specific CD8+ T-cell responses were only detected in recipients of AdC7-GRN, and were comparable between F4/AS01-primed and na\u00efve macaques. The CD8+ T-cell response against HIV-1 antigens supports observations made with other replication-incompetent simian adenoviral vectors expressing HIV-1 or SIV antigens in preclinical models [32\u201337,39,53]. Taken together, only the heterologous prime-boost regimens allowed for a balanced response of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with the two candidate vaccines acting complementarily rather than synergistically. After one AdC7-GRN administration, the magnitude of the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response was comparable to that observed after one administration of a SIV antigen-expressing AdC7 or AdC6 vector in macaques in a recent study [54]. However, after a second AdC7-GRN immunization, the CD8+ T-cell response measured in the current study appeared to be less potent than the response observed after a heterologous second immunization with AdC6 or AdC7 vectors in ref. [54]. Potentially, the use of alternating AdC vectors in ref. [54] circumvented the induction of low-level adenoviral vector-specific nAb responses, which may have been present after AdC7-GRN immunization in our study. Boosting with poxvirus-based vectors (MVA or NYVAC) after AdC vector priming has also been shown to efficiently increase the frequency of insert-specific CD8+ T cells [22,39,40,42,55]. In NHP or in mice, AdC and Ad5 vectors generally appeared to induce comparable magnitudes of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells [32,56]. However, the responses differed in terms of memory phenotypes and cytokine expression profiles, with a higher level of functional exhaustion and a relatively high proportion of single cytokine-expressing T cells after Ad5 vaccination [39,57]. Adenoviral vectors, particularly after a single administration, may generally be more immunogenic in NHP or mice as compared to MVA vectors or DNA vaccines (which require multiple administrations to induce a potent CD8+ T-cell response [58\u201361]). However, when used in prime-boost, a DNA prime-NYVAC boost regimen has been shown to induce a robust HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell response in macaques [62], with a magnitude comparable to that observed with the AdC7 vector in the present study, though the magnitude of the induced CD4+ T-cell response tended to be lower than the one obtained with an adjuvanted protein in the current study. Lastly, in our study, the sequence of vaccine administration did not have an impact on the magnitude of the observed responses persisting at 6 months post last vaccination.",

Moreover, when administered in a heterologous prime-boost schedule, priming or boosting with AdC7-GRN altered the F4/AS01-induced immune profile (which was dominated by single cytokine-expressing IL-2+ CD4+ T cells), by increasing the frequencies of polyfunctional CD4+ T cells expressing IL-2 in combination with IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF-\u03b1. This is encouraging since HIV patients with a \u2018controller\u2019 status were shown to have higher proportions of Gag-specific CD4+ T cells producing 3 cytokines than other HIV patient categories [63], and polyfunctional HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been associated with long-term non-progressing disease and low viral load in humans [9\u201313,63]. The predominance of IL-2-secreting cells among F4/AS01-induced CD4+ T-cell responses, as found in the present study, is in line with previous clinical results with F4/AS01 [44,45]. While IL-2 production predominance is a common feature of adjuvanted protein vaccines [64], it has also been linked to favorable clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients [10,65,66]. IL-2 is associated with memory T cells, as well as T-cell proliferation and differentiation [10,67].",

This distribution of antigenic specificities as well as the cytokine expression profiles of the F4/AS01-induced CD4+ T-cell responses, were in agreement with the features of the CD4+ T-cell responses seen in human F4/AS01 recipients [44]. Although the predominance of RT and p24-specific responses could be a function of the respective lengths of the antigen sequences in F4, and/or associated number of epitopes contained therein, this result is still promising since the same CD4+ T-cell specificity distribution was seen among responses in HIV-infected patients with spontaneous viral control [68]. Illustrating the importance of Gag-specific responses, the frequency of polyfunctional Gag-specific CD8+ T cells was found to be highly associated with the ability of CD8+ T cells to control SIV and HIV-1 viremia [10,23,49,69,70].",

Similar results were found with Gag-expressing chimpanzee adenoviral vector prime-boost regimens in NHP, which induced a balance between CD8+ TEM and TCM cells [32]. CD8+ TEM-cell responses have been shown to be associated with the control of pathogenic SIV challenge, with some evidence of viral clearance [4,5,71]. Therefore, a vaccine that elicits persistent specific TEM-biased responses, particularly at mucosal sites, may be able to contribute to initial viral control. However, TCM cells, which have limited immediate effector functions, are known to replenish the TEM cell pool in a dynamic turnover, and may therefore also contribute to protection. Indeed, in elite controllers who had maintained only minimal CD8+ T-cell responses, highly functional, broad-spectrum TCM cells were detected, which were shown to suppress HIV in vitro [72].",

Responses were higher in genital tract mucosa as compared to intestinal mucosa or systemic organs (liver and spleen), as also observed with other adenoviral vectors [18,19,73]. Maintenance of robust mucosal CD8+ T-cell responses is important for viral control in NHP [75\u201378], as well as in humans for whom it has been associated with a favourable clinical outcome [79\u201382]. Furthermore, due to haematogenous viral dissemination, maintenance of functional CD8+ T-cell responses in local and systemic compartments is also considered to be important for infection control in NHP [5]. Whether or not our findings in mice would translate to NHP or humans remains to be determined. However, the distribution of mucosal cellular responses among anatomical compartments after IM immunization with Ad vector-based SIV vaccines was previously shown to be comparable between these two models [18,19,73].",

Recent findings indicate that HIV-1 envelope-specific non-neutralizing IgG antibodies may be important for protection against HIV or simian-human immunodeficiency virus acquisition [22,23,85,86], suggesting that an HIV-1 prophylactic vaccine should also contain envelope-based antigens.

Coprology showed the presence of a few Trichuris Trichiura eggs, but the observed quantity did not explain the clinical symptoms. Subsequent macroscopic and microscopic post-mortem examinations indicated that the animal\u2019s poor health condition was not causally related to the immunizations, but did not conclusively reveal the cause of death. All other monkeys were euthanized humanely by an overdose of anesthetic after completion of the experiments.",

A/C panels: Representative dot plot graphs of CD4+ (A panel) and CD8+ (C panel) T-cell responses. Local CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were analyzed with respect to the production of IFN-\u03b3 (shown from a representative sample), IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 (not shown). The numbers in the quadrant gates of the plots represent the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells. FSC, forward scatter. B/D panels: Frequencies and cytokine expression profile of F4-specific CD4+ (B panel) and CD8+ (D panel) T cells expressing at least one cytokine among IL-2, IFN- and TNF- localized in the different anatomical compartments are represented as individual data and group means. Each symbol corresponds to a pool containing samples of 20 animals (genital tract), 5 animals (small intestine) or 3 animals (liver), or to a sample from 1 animal (spleen).",
