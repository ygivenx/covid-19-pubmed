IFV-infected WT mice appeared visibly ill with ruffled fur and reduced oral intake 6 to 10 days after infection, whereas Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice appeared more active than the WT mice. Consistent with their apparent activity, the final survival rate on day 21 after infection was significantly improved in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice (~80%) as compared with that in WT mice (~50%; Fig. 1a). Histopathological analysis of the IFV-infected lungs on days 4 and 8 revealed that lung inflammation, which was the most obvious on day 8 in WT mice, was much less severe in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 1b).",

Consistent with the pathological data, the total number of infiltrated cells in BALF from Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice was decreased compared to that from WT mice on days 4 and 8 after IFV infection (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. S1a\u2013c). This was attributed to the significant decrease in neutrophils that comprised the major subpopulations of infiltrated cells (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the numbers of T, B, and natural killer cells as well as macrophages were not significantly altered in BALF from the Mint3\u2212/\u2212 lungs (Fig. 1c). The levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, i.e., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1, CXCL1/KC, and CXCL10/IP-10, which have been reported to contribute to lung pathology111216, also decreased in BALF from Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to those from WT mice on day 4 after infection (Fig. 1d). In addition, the levels of CXCL1/KC and CXCL10/IP-10 in BALF from Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice remained lower than those from WT mice on day 8 after infection. These data indicate that host Mint3 contributes to cytokine/chemokine production including the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1/KC at an early time point after IFV infection and influences subsequent inflammatory cell recruitment and lung pathology at a later time point. Collectively, Mint3 depletion attenuated the severe influenza pneumonia and improved host mortality in mice.",

            "text": "Activation of innate immunity in response to IFV regulates anti-viral protective immunity31. To evaluate the impact of Mint3 deficiency on anti-IFV protection, we first analysed the viral copy number in the IFV-infected lungs of WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice on day 0, 4, and 8 following the IFV infection. Mint3 depletion did not largely affect the viral copy number in the IFV-infected lungs (Fig. 2a). Type-I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) are the primary factors that induce host resistance to IFV. In particular, IFN-\u03b1 induction in the late stage of IFV infection is essential for protection against IFV3132. In contrast to cytokine/chemokine production, no significant difference was observed in IFN-\u03b1 production in the infected lungs between WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2b). Notably, the level of the type-II interferon IFN-\u03b3 was significantly lower in the lungs of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 after infection (Fig. 2b) for unknown reasons. Next, we assessed the induction of humoral acquired immunity against IFV in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice. WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected again with IFV on day 21 after the first infection (representing the second infection) and the production of virus-specific antibodies was analysed on day 7 after the second infection. Mint3 depletion in mice affected neither the production of virus-specific IgG in the serum nor virus-specific IgA in the lung mucosa (Fig. 2c). Collectively, these data suggest that Mint3 is dispensable for the induction of protective immunity against IFV infection in mice.",

Mint3 depletion affects macrophage function owing to reduced HIF-1 activity and ATP production via glycolysis252728. Thus, we focused on the function of Mint3 in macrophages and dendritic cells, and examined whether Mint3 in macrophages and dendritic cells is required for cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV. Alveolar macrophages (AMFs), thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages (TG-MFs), bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMFs), bone marrow-derived conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), or Flt3 ligand-induced plasmacytoid dendritic cells (FLT3L-DCs) prepared from WT or Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice were brought into contact with IFV in vitro and the production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and CCL2/MCP-1 was measured. The cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV decreased in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 AMFs (Fig. 3a), TG-MFs (Fig. 3b), and BMMFs (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, Mint3 depletion in BMMFs also attenuated cytokine/chemokine production in response to other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in addition to IFV, such as LPS (Supplementary Fig. S2a), poly I:C (Supplementary Fig. S2b), and imiquimod (R837, Supplementary Fig. S2c). However, Mint3 depletion did not affect IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, or CCL2/MCP-1 production in cDCs (Fig. 3d) and FLT3-DCs (Fig. 3e) in response to IFV. Thus, the reduced cytokine/chemokine production by macrophages in response to IFV, but not by dendritic cells, likely accounts at least in part for the attenuation of influenza pneumonia in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Although Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibit reduced HIF-1 activity252728, it remains unclear whether Mint3 also influences the activation of NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor that induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines34. Thus, the expression levels of NF-\u03baB target genes such as Il6, Tnf, and Ccl2 in IFV-stimulated WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were analysed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. The expression levels of Il6, Tnf, and Ccl2 mRNA decreased in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs following IFV stimulation (Fig. 4a). Next, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in IFV-stimulated BMMFs was examined by immunoblotting. Notably, NF-\u03baB protein levels in the nuclear extracts of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs were lower than those of WT cells at the starting point (0 h) and remained lower during the observed time after IFV infection (Fig. 4b). Translocation of cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB to the nucleus is usually suppressed by inhibitor of \u03baB (I\u03baB); however, I\u03baB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates I\u03baB and thereby promotes proteasomal degradation of I\u03baB when the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway is activated34. Thus, we analysed I\u03baB and IKK in the cytoplasmic extracts from IFV-infected WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs. The expression and phosphorylation levels of IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 showed no apparent differences between WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs (Fig. 4c). However, the expression levels of I\u03baB\u03b1 markedly increased in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs at the starting point (0 h) and remained higher than those of WT cells during the observed time after IFV stimulation (Fig. 4c). In turn, a lower proportion of I\u03baB\u03b1 was phosphorylated in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 BMMFs after IFV stimulation (Fig. 4c). Taken together, these findings indicate that Mint3 depletion resulted in the accumulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 in the cytoplasm and suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB in response to IFV stimulation in macrophages.",

To address this issue, I\u03baB\u03b1 and AMPK\u03b1 in IFV-infected WT BMMFs treated with or without 2-DG were analysed. 2-DG treatment did not impact either total or phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 levels whereas both total and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 levels increased in IFV-infected WT BMMFs (Fig. 5d) and nuclear NF-\u03baB levels decreased (Fig. 5e). These results indicate that AMPK activation via the glycolysis defect attenuates NF-\u03baB signalling independently from I\u03baB accumulation in IFV-infected macrophages. In turn, we next examined whether I\u03baB accumulation alone could attenuate NF-\u03baB signalling in IFV-infected macrophages. To address this possibility, IFV-infected WT BMMFs were treated with or without an I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation inhibitor, BAY 11-708237. BAY 11-7082 treatment decreased phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 levels and increased total I\u03baB\u03b1 levels without affecting total and phosphorylated AMPK\u03b1 levels in IFV-infected WT BMMFs (Fig. 5f). Under this condition, BAY 11-7082 treatment decreased nuclear NF-\u03baB levels in WT BMMFs 3\u20136 h after IFV infection (Fig. 5g). BAY 11\u20137082 treatment also decreased the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in WT BMMFs to the levels of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 5h).

In macrophages, Mint3 depletion also attenuated cytokine/chemokine production in response to IFV infection by suppressing the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. This suppression in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages appeared to be mediated by two independent mechanisms: I\u03baB\u03b1 accumulation and AMPK activation (Fig. 6).

            "text": "Mint3 was considered dispensable for anti-IFV immunity because Mint3 depletion did not alter viral burden, the elevation of IFN-\u03b1, or the induction of anti-viral adaptive B cell responses in the IFV-infected mice. Thus, other innate mechanisms independent of the Mint3 pathway may play a more dominant role in protective immunity against IFV. Type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 production was reduced in the lungs of Mint3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to that in the lungs of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 after IFV infection (Fig. 2b). As IFN-\u03b3 expression is regulated by HIF-138, Mint3 depletion might affect IFN-\u03b3 expression after IFV infection in mice. IFN-\u03b3 is not essential for viral clearance39; however, its presence during IFV infection ameliorates the severity of inflammation and lung injury40. Although how much the reduction of IFN-\u03b3 levels by Mint3 depletion affects the IFV-mediated lung injury remains unclear, supplementation with IFN-\u03b3 might support therapies of IFV-infected lung diseases based on Mint3 inhibition.",

            "text": "Mint3 promotes ATP production via glycolysis by activating HIF-1 in macrophages252728. AMPK is activated when the ATP concentration decreases in cells35. Thus, Mint3 depletion activated AMPK and thereby suppressed the NF-\u03baB signalling in macrophages. Notably, AMPK\u03b1 protein levels increased after IFV infection in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 and 2-DG treated WT macrophages, whereas the basal protein levels of AMPK\u03b1 were comparable between WT and Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages (Fig. 5b,d). Infectious stress might boost the AMPK signalling by increasing the amount of AMPK\u03b1 protein in macrophages in combination with energy stress. Besides AMPK, HIF-1 also influences cytokine/chemokine transcription directly4142. Thus, Mint3-mediated HIF-1 activation might also contribute to the cytokine/chemokine production independently from AMPK in macrophages. In addition to AMPK, I\u03baB\u03b1 was also accumulated in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages. Although activated/phosphorylated IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 levels were comparable, less I\u03baB\u03b1 was phosphorylated in Mint3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages than in WT cells after IFV infection. Mint3 activates HIF-1 by suppressing its inhibitor, FIH-1. FIH-1 is an asparaginyl hydroxylase and hydroxylates the \u03b1 subunit of HIF-1 and other molecules including I\u03baB\u03b129. Although the hydroxylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 by FIH-1 has not been reported to affect the stability of I\u03baB\u03b1 in vitro43, FIH-1 might influence the phosphorylation state of I\u03baB\u03b1 in macrophages.",
