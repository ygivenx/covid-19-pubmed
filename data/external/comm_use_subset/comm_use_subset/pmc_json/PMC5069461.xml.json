The sample preparation and microarray hybridization were performed based on the manufacturer\u2019s standard protocols with minor modifications. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA after removal of rRNA (mRNA-ONLY\u2122 Eukaryotic mRNA Isolation Kit, Epicentre). Then, each sample was amplified and transcribed into fluorescent cRNA along the entire length of the transcripts without 3\u2032 bias utilizing a mixture of oligo(dT) and random primers (Arraystar Flash RNA Labeling Kit, Arraystar). The labeled cRNAs were hybridized onto the Human LncRNA Array v3.0 (8 \u00d7 60 K, Arraystar). Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray V3.0 is designed for the global profiling of about 30,586 human LncRNAs. The LncRNAs are carefully constructed using the most highly-respected public transcriptome databases (Refseq, UCSC knowngenes, Gencode, etc), as well as landmark publications. Each transcript is represented by a specific exon or splice junction probe which can identify individual transcript accurately. Positive probes for housekeeping genes and negative probes are also printed onto the array for hybridization quality control. After having washed the slides, the arrays were scanned by the Agilent Scanner G2505C. Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 11.0.1.1) was used to analyze acquired array images. Quantile normalization and subsequent data processing were performed using the GeneSpring GX v12.1 software package (Agilent Technologies). After quantile normalization of the raw data, LncRNAs that at least 4 out of 12 samples have flags in Present or Marginal were chosen for differentially expressed LncRNAs screening.",

            "text": "HIV latency is a state of replication restriction when either few viruses are reproduced or viruses are reproduced intermittently. The quantitative and/or temporal dimension of establishment of HIV persistence is determined by many factors such as cell\u2019s life span, their infection susceptibility and proliferative ability, alterations in cellular physiology and/or immunologic controls, etc. Cells of monocyte/macrophages lineage is one of the principal targets of HIV among others. These cells are more resistant - than CD4+ T or other cells - to the cytopathic effect induced via apoptosis during HIV infection. In turn, they make more stable hideouts and can harbor HIV for longer time. As an important viral reservoir, macrophages can disseminate HIV across all organ systems because of its universal presence in body23. A decade of efforts made in the direction of eliminating HIV reservoirs is strongly suggesting towards involvement of unknown, sophisticated epigenetic regulatory machinery that is beyond known landscape of histone modifications and small non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs. The complex paradigm of lncRNAs-based transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation is gradually being unfolded and evidences insinuate them as a central player in driving epigenetic remodeling in different non-viral24 and viral disease systems such as SARS corona virus, influenza virus, Marek\u2019s disease virus, herpes simplex virus, etc.17. Couple of recent studies shows specific lncRNA-based modulation of HIV replication. Nonetheless, lncRNAs in these studies were selected based on their role in other diseases2122. Another study by Saayman et al.24 examined HIV-encoded antisense lncRNAs in epigenetic control of HIV transcriptions. Discovery of new, physiologically relevant lncRNAs continues to rise in human cells and as such examining one or few dozen lncRNAs from other disorders may little reflect the cumulative intensities about their role in HIV infection. In this microarray analysis, we profiled global lncRNAs in both active and latent infection. With a profiling ability of 30,586 human LncRNAs, our assay could detect 1184 differentially expressed lncRNAs in active infection and 4523 differentially expressed lncRNAs in latent infection. This difference in the no. of lncRNAs between active and latent infection may be attributed to the differences in the degree or intensity of epigenetic modifications during respective infection stages. The continued transcriptional suppression of HIV genome post-integration, for latency maintenance, may require greater degree of epigenomic involvement compared to active infection where epigenomic alterations may be of little significance. Moreover, intrinsic transcriptional originality of the cell lines may also partially contribute to these differences because promonocytic U1 latent cells, a subclone of U937, are chronically infected with HIV-1 compared to U-937 monocytes used for active HIV-1 infection. Many of these lncRNAs were specifically modulated during active or latent infection. Nonetheless a big amount of them were either upregulated or downregulated in both infection scenarios. These variations in lncRNAs expression between two different HIV infection conditions further substantiate the greater role of epigenetic regulators and that lncRNAs may have specific \u201con-and-off\u201d switching mechanism to drive latent or active condition. Understanding such mechanism \u2013 if exists \u2013 can better be revealed by knowing their chromosomal locations and its relationship with nearby coding gene. We found that these modulated lncRNAs during HIV active or latent infection are distributed on both \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2212\u201d strand of different chromosomes and belongs to all groups: intergenic, intron sense-overlapping, exon-sense overlapping, natural antisense, intronic antisense, and bidirectional (supplementary data 1). This knowledge can certainly be helpful in determining lncRNAs associated host factors responsible for guiding epigenetic remodeling.",

            "text": "A more holistic understanding of lncRNAs mechanism requires establishing their association with mRNAs. Several studies have shown that lncRNAs can behave as transcription enhancer or suppressor in an orientation-independent or dependent manner25. As such, we first established global profiling of mRNAs in both active and latent infection. With a profiling ability of 26,109 coding transcripts, we found 1125 and 7138 mRNAs differentially modulated during active and latent infection, respectively. Similar to lncRNAs, modulated mRNAs were specific to and shared by active and latent infection. This quantitative pattern of mRNA modulations between active and latent infection is in parallel with that of lncRNAs suggesting high degree of lncRNAs involvement in epigenetic modifications and subsequent transcriptional control. Importantly, this raises the possibility that HIV may induce parallel manipulation of lncRNAs and mRNAs as a mechanism to dominate host cellular machinery. Nonetheless, this parallel manipulation may exist for both unrelated or closely associated lncRNAs and mRNAs. We could establish about 1068 lncRNAs and associated mRNAs pair modulated during HIV active and/or latent infection. Role of lncRNAs in regulation of marker genes have been established in other diseases25. In fact, several of mRNAs from the modulated \u201clncRNAs-mRNAs\u201d pair have been established in the HIV infection. For example, Histone deacetylase (HDAC) regulates transcription of numerous cellular and viral genes. It has been shown that the class I HDACs, HDAC1, \u22122, and \u22123, are recruited to the HIV-1 LTR in cell line models of HIV-1 latency26. The sub-class I selective inhibitors for HDAC1, \u22122, and \u22123 have shown to induce latent HIV-1 expression strongly in resting CD4 + T cells27. Moreover, tat induced upregulation of HDAC2 are also reported to induce transcriptional repression leading to neurocognitive impairment28. The RUNX protein, which works in combination with the co-factor CBF-\u03b2, function as critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells29. RUNX1 bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR repressing the transcription. Lower expression of BDNF has been reported in HIV-infected individuals with HAD than in non-demented HIV30. The decrease in BDNF evoked by HIV is believed to contribute to the development of synaptic simplification and neuronal damage seen in HAD. BRCA1, which is present at the HIV-1 LTR in a highly relevant model of HIV infection, is another protein found to be important for viral transcription. The cells that lack BRCA1 have severely reduced HIV-1 Tat-dependent transcription31. Gain or loss-of-function studies have shown to enhance or decrease transcription. Moreover, BRCA1 has been shown to be in complex with pTEF-b, and Cyclin T1 has been shown to be an essential factor for BRCA1-dependent activation of RNAP II transcription.",

In fact, pathways and gene ontology analysis shows their involvement in 155 biological cycles where majority of enriched network belonged to immunological and inflammatory significance. This was expected because most infection including that by HIV induces immunological and inflammatory defense signaling. HIV infection induces various secondary infections and therefore enrichment of network associated with salmonella infection, influenza infection, herpes simplex virus infection, tuberculosis, pertussis, hepatitis B, staphylococcus infection, etc. may imply the likelihood of such opportunistic infections during HIV pathogenesis. Interestingly, enrichment of replication associated pathways (such as RNA transport pathway, Nucleotide excision pathway, Spliceosome pathway, and Pyrimidine metabolism, etc.) during latent infection suggest towards a highly sophisticated and regressive epigenetics overhauling in compare to active infection. This is also reflected in the quantitative differences of the total differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs between active and latent infection. Now challenge ahead is to examine pathophysiological significant of these closely associated, differential expressed \u201clncRNAs-mRNAs\u201d pair one by one. Nonetheless, active and latent stages are two opposite facet of the HIV infection and therefore, expression reversal of a specific gene set (Active upregulation/downregualtion <=> latent downregulation/upregulation) between these two conditions cannot be excluded. It is possible that expression reversal of certain genes between active and latent infection, independently or together with the active and latent infection-specific uniquely modulated genes, can have remarkable pathophysiological significance. Genetic commonality (close association) may potentiate susceptibility of other related disorders. In fact, copy number variants and temporal expression differences of a specific gene associated with one neurological and autoimmune disorder can predispose to others32.
