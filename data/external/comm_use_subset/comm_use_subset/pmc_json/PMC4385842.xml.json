Myc expression is deregulated in a wide range of human cancers and is therefore a therapeutic target. Recently, it was found that the RNA-binding protein human antigen R inhibits c-Myc expression by recruiting miRNA let-7-loaded RISC (RNA miRNA-induced silencing complex) to the c-Myc 3\u2032UTR [6]. This raises the possibility of developing c-Myc inhibitors by targeting its associated RNP.",

Active pRb acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell cycle progression [7]. In the hypophosphorylated active form, pRb sequesters the transcriptional factor E2F. When pRb is inactivated by hyperphosphorylation, it releases E2F, permitting E2F to execute its cell cycle regulatory functions. Therefore, the hyperphosphorylation of pRb during late G1 phase enables the activation of E2F-dependent transcription, e.g cyclin A2 [12].",

This caprin-1/G3BP1 complex is thought to regulate the transport and translation of mRNAs whose protein products are involved in proliferation and migration in multiple cell types because the carboxyl-terminal region of caprin-1 selectively binds to c-Myc or cyclin D2 mRNAs [13].

The elucidation of the cellular targets of therapeutic natural products not only contributes to the identification of valuable novel drug targets for future development, but also guides subsequent molecular pharmacology and mode-of-action studies [14, 16]. Tylophorine-related natural compounds, which are found in the Asclepiadaceae and Moraceae plant families, exhibit multiple biological activities (e.g., anti-cancer, anti-coronavirus, and anti-inflammatory activities) [17-24]. Tylophorine compounds have been the focus of drug development as therapeutic agents since the 1960s, whereas tylocrebrine failed phase I clinical trials due to neurotoxicity [17]. Although several modes of action for anti-cancer tylophorine compounds have been reported [20, 25-28], their direct cellular target(s) and related pathways remain to be elucidated [24]. In particular, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the broad spectrum, drug-resistant cancer cell inhibitory activities of tylophorine compounds remain to be investigated.",

Recently, we successfully synthesized potent tylophorine-derived dibenzoquinolines that elicit the same biological functions as traditional pentacyclic tylophorine compounds [23]. Therefore, we concluded that the angular dibenzoquinoline moiety in tylophorine compounds is responsible for the interactions with their direct target molecule(s). Thus, we sought to design and synthesize a biotinylated tylophorine-derived dibenzoquinoline (Fig. 1A), referred to herein as the \u201cbiotinylated tylophorine\u201d, to probe direct interacting molecules in cells. The biotinylated tylophorine retained anti-cancer cell activity with IC50 values of ~13-30 \u03bcM against HONE-1, MCF7, or NUGC-3 carcinoma cells (see Supplemental Table 1).",

A total of 6 protein bands were specifically associated with biotinylated tylophorine compared to biotin-X-SSE (Fig. 1B); these bands were excised for further matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics analyses. The potential tylophorine-interacting proteins were identified by Mascot data analysis (Fig. 1C and Supplemental Table 2), and the specific interaction of these proteins with biotinylated tylophorine was validated by western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). Caprin-1, \u03b1-actinin-4, nucleolin, the splicing factor (PSF), polyadenylate-binding protein-1 (PABP-1), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M3-M4 (hnRNPM3-M4), hnRNPQ, TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N isoform 1 (TAF-15), G3BP1, 40S ribosomal protein S6 (S6), phosphorylated S6 (p-S6), and ribosomal protein S3 were specifically pulled down by biotinylated tylophorine compared to biotin-X-SSE or DMSO, but the expression levels of these proteins in tylophorine-treated HONE-1 or MCF7 carcinoma cells were not significantly altered compared with DMSO-treated cells, with the exception of p-S6, which was significantly increased (Fig. 1E).",

Moreover, a low abundance of cyclin D2 has been observed in certain carcinoma cell lines [30-32], such as MCF7 (Fig. 3A); under certain conditions, the loss of a specific cyclin can be compensated by the presence of others [33, 34]. Further investigation revealed that cyclin D1 mRNA co-localizes with the caprin-1, G3BP1, and c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex (Fig. 2B), as well as within polysomal fractions (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that either cyclin D1 or D2 mRNAs might be sequestered by biotinylated tylophorine (Fig. 2B & 2D) or associated with a tylophorine-targeted RNP complex in tylophorine-treated HONE-1 cells (Fig. 2D).",

Tylophorine treatment increased the mRNA levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 in both HONE-1 and MCF7 cells. Cyclin D2 mRNA levels were increased only in HONE-1 cells upon tylophorine treatment since cyclin D2 mRNA level was undetectable in MCF7 cells as reported [30-32], regardless of tylophorine treatment (Fig. 3A). However, c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein levels were diminished in HONE-1, MCF7, or NUGC-3 cells upon tylophorine treatment (Fig. 3B). In addition, and as expected, cyclin D2 protein levels were decreased in tylophorine treated HONE-1 and NUGC-3 but no cyclin D2 were detectable in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, we used TAMRA to label the newly synthesized protein after tylophorine treatment and followed by immunoprecipitation and western blot to detect the proteins of interest. We found that the de novo protein syntheses of c-Myc and cyclinD1/D2 were diminished upon tylophorine treatment but not that of G3BP1 protein (Fig. 3C). When HONE-1 cells were depleted with caprin-1 by siRNA, the resultant cells became more resistant to tylophorine compounds with an ~2 fold higher IC50 value for tylophorine and its potent derivative DBQ 33b (dibenzoquinoline-33b) (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, the amounts of G3BP1 protein (Fig. 3E) and mRNAs of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 pulled down by biotinylated tylophorine were decreased (Fig. 3F).",

Strikingly, the expression of cyclins D1/D2 was not restored by ectopic overexpression of c-Myc (Fig. 4B), even though cyclins D1/D2 are downstream target genes of c-Myc signaling [36, 37]. The resulting hyperphosphorylation of pRb can be, at least in part, attributed to increased levels of cyclin B1 [38] (Fig. 4B), a c-Myc target and another upstream effector of pRb, or feedback from upregulated cyclin A2, as ectopic overexpression of cyclin A2 was also able to partially resume the hyperphosphorylation of pRb (Fig. 4C). These results further emphasize that even ectopically expressed c-Myc can upregulate or stabilize the transcription of cyclins D1 and D2, but their mRNA is subject to sequestration by tylophorine in the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex, thereby blocking their translation. Therefore, ectopically expressed c-Myc resumed the hyperphosphorylation of pRb through a pathway independent of cyclins D1/D2.",

We observed the sustained blockade of c-Myc protein expression in each of the individual carcinoma cell lines upon treatment with tylophorine or its potent derivative DBQ 33b [23] but not in the fibroblast cell lines. c-Myc protein expression levels were reduced to 1-33% (Fig. 6A), whereas c-Myc mRNA levels were increased by 1.5-4.5-fold (Figs. 3A, 6B, & 6C). We also performed gene expression profiling and analysis of the c-Myc downstream pathways that were affected by tylophorine or DBQ 33b (Fig. 6B), as well as validation by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6C). Both compounds increased the expression of c-Myc mRNA by ~2-4-fold; the mRNA levels of genes that were upregulated by c-Myc were decreased (e.g., cyclin A2, cyclin B1, SERBP1, PRDX3, and POLR3G), and the mRNA levels of genes that were downregulated by c-Myc increased (e.g., GADD45A, and THBS1) (Fig. 6B and 6C). These results are consistent with the above observation that increased c-Myc mRNA levels and decreased c-Myc protein levels occurred in tylophorine-treated cells, which led to negative regulation of c-Myc effector pathways. The genes, whose expression was upregulated or downregulated by tylophorine and DBQ 33b, associated with the function of c-Myc in carcinogenesis are shown in Fig. 6D.",

RNP complexes exhibit multiple roles, dynamic conformations, and chemical instability. Therefore, targeting RNPs for the discovery or development of therapeutic agents remains a challenge. However, several antiviral agents have been reported to target viral RNP complexes with high potency and exhibit significant potential for development into therapeutic drugs [43-45]. To the best of our knowledge, no anti-cancer agent targeting an RNP complex has been reported. We are the first to report that targeting an RNP complex (i.e., targeting the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-containing RNP complex by tylophorine compounds) in carcinoma cells can efficiently elicit anti-cancer activity.",

Moreover, cytoplasmic mRNAs cycle between polysomes, P-bodies and stress granules and translational repress can occur in these compartments through different mechanisms [46]. In addition to tylophorine treatment dramatically decreased the formation of P-bodies (Fig. 5C), stress granules were nearly not found either in DMSO or tylophorine treated carcinoma cells (Supplemental Figure 1). Using TAMRA to label the newly synthesized protein by tylophorine treatment, we clearly demonstrated that tylophorine repressed the protein expression of c-Myc and cyclins D1/D2 (Fig. 3C). These results further firm that tylophorine sequestered the RNP containing caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA in the polysomal fractions (Fig. 2D) and blocked the corresponding mRNAs' translation. However, the detailed underlying mechanisms must be carefully addressed and further investigated. Our results suggest that caprin-1 is highly associated with the transport of c-Myc, cyclin D1, and cyclin D2 mRNAs for translation. Thus, the abrogation of this specific biological function of caprin-1 results in the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase [47].",

Thus, it is conceivable that the inhibition of c-Myc significantly contributes to the broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity of tylophorine compounds against drug-resistant carcinoma cells. Moreover, the induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 [47] by knockdown of caprin-1 suggests that, in addition to the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-associated RNP complex, caprin-1 itself may have favorable potential as a novel anti-cancer drug target.",

Tylophorine enhances the c-Jun downregulation of the cyclin A2 promoter activity and results in carcinoma cells dominantly arrested at G1 phase for anti-cancer activity [25]. The ectopically overexpressed c-Myc did not affect the accumulation of c-Jun induced by tylophorine treatment but did increase the expression of cyclin A2 via hyperphosphorylated pRb (Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that the elevation of c-Jun levels by tylophorine [23, 25] functions in concert with the targeting of the caprin-1 and c-Myc mRNA-containing RNP complex to produce the anti-cancer activity of tylophorine compounds (Fig. 7).",
