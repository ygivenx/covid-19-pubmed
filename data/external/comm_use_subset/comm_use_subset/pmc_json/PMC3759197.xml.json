            "text": "Chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy are the most common types of cancer treatments available nowadays. The history of chemotherapy began in the early 20th century, but its use in treating cancer began in the 1930s. The term \u201cchemotherapy\u201d was coined by the German scientist Paul Ehrlich, who had a particular interest in alkylating agents and who came up with the term to describe the chemical treatment of disease. During the First and Second World Wars, it was noticed that soldiers exposed to mustard gas experienced decreased levels of leukocytes. This led to the use of nitrogen mustard as the first chemotherapy agent to treat lymphomas, a treatment used by Gilman in 1943. In the following years, alkylating drugs such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil were synthesized to fight cancer [1,2]. Kilte and Farber designed folate antagonists such as aminopterin and amethopterin, leading to the development of methotrexate, which in 1948 achieved leukemia remission in children [3]. Elion and Hitchings developed 6-thioquanine and 6-mercaptopurine in 1951 for treating leukemia [4,5]. Heidelberger developed a drug for solid tumors, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is up to now an important chemotherapy agent against colorectal, head and neck cancer [6]. The 1950s saw the design of corticosteroids, along with the establishment of the Cancer Chemotherapy National Service Center in 1955, whose purpose was to test cancer drugs. At that time, monotherapy drugs only achieved brief responses in some types of cancers [7]. By 1958, the first cancer to be cured with chemotherapy, choriocarcinoma, was reported [8]. During the 1960s, the main targets were hematologic cancers. Better treatments were developed, with alkaloids from vinca and ibenzmethyzin (procarbazine) applied to leukemia and Hodgkin's disease [9-11]. In the 1970s, advanced Hodgkin's disease was made curable with chemotherapy using the MOMP protocol [12,13], which combined nitrogen mustard with vincristine, methotrexate and prednisone, and the MOPP protocol [14,15], containing procarbazine but no methotrexate. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were treated with the same therapy and, in 1975, a cure for advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was reported using protocol C-MOPP, which substituted cyclophosphamide for nitrogen mustard [16].",

There were some promising publications about the use of adjuvant chemotherapy after radiotherapy or surgery in curing patients with advanced cancer. Breast cancer was the first type of disease in which positive results with adjuvant therapy were obtained, and also the first example of multimodality treatment, a strategy currently employed for treatment of numerous types of tumors. In the late 1960s, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy changed the concept of localized treatment.",

            "text": "There was significant progress in 1978 when higher cure rates of metastatic germ cancer were achieved by combining cisplatin, bleomycin and vinblastine [17-19]. The experience with polychemotherapy in hematologic cancer brought to light the fact that different drugs act against tumor cells in different phases of their cellular cycle. One of these solid tumor drugs was CMF (cytoxan, methotrexate and fluorouracil), a standard therapy for treating breast cancer for over 30 years. Understanding of molecular changes in cancer cells quickly developed after the 1970s. As a consequence, numerous drugs with various mechanisms of action were introduced during the 1980s. Subsequent advances and developments led to liposomal therapy, which places drugs inside liposomes (vesicles made of lipid bilayers), decreasing some of the side effects of chemotherapy such as cardiotoxicity. Examples of liposomal drugs include liposomal doxorubicin and daunorubicin, one of the first steps in nanotechnology-based approaches. The 1990s sparked the beginning of targeted chemotherapy by screening for specific critical molecular targets. These advances in modern chemotherapy and studies on genetics and molecular biology contributed to the ongoing decline in death rates. Data from the genome sequence suggested that many dysfunctions associated with cancer could be due to the abnormal function of some protein kinases. The current pharmacological trend has been to develop kinase inhibitors [20,21]. The first tumors targeted with drugs approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the EMEA (European Medicines Agency) were renal cell cancer, hepatocellular cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In recent years, numerous specific tumors have been tested with various kinase inhibitors and there is a trend towards combining chemotherapy with these new targeted therapies.",

In pediatric patients, curable cancers include acute leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, Wilms' tumor and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Although treatment is not always curative for these cancers, there has been significant improvement in progression-free and overall survival. Another modality of treatment is neoadjuvant therapy, which aims to reduce the size of the primary tumor and prevent micrometastases. This type of treatment improves on more conservative surgical techniques in preserving the functionality of important organs. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for anal, breast, lung, gastroesophageal, rectal, bladder and head and neck cancer, as well as some types of sarcoma. There are many cancers for which adjuvant chemotherapy has been established with curative effect, and with the new effective drugs and combinations the curability rates are expected to rise even more. Since 1990, the incidence and mortality of cancer have been declining and despite the increase in the elderly population [22], mortality rates for the United States declined from 2005 to 2007.",

Additionally, in 1904, Young made the first radical suprapubic prostatectomy. Modern surgery has changed significantly, with Halstedian techniques replaced by non-invasive procedures such as laparoscopic colectomy (for the removal of colon cancer) [26], videothoracoscopy, radiofrequency ablation and radiosurgery techniques such as Cyberknife\u00ae [27]. Breast-conserving surgery with sentinel-node removal has been used to improve esthetic results and avoid lymphedema [28]. Another example of conservative surgery is the use of laryngoscopic laser surgery in early laryngeal cancer [29]. The most recent development is the Da Vinci\u00ae, a robotic system for the removal of cancer from prostate and kidney [30].",

            "text": "The discovery of X-rays and radiation by Becquerel and Rontgen in the late 19th century was the first step towards radiation treatment. Marie Curie's work greatly contributed to the development of radiotherapy. The first cancer case cured exclusively by radiation occurred in 1898. After World War II, technological progress allowed charged particles to be propelled through a vacuum tunnel called linac, or linear accelerator. In 1960, Ginzton and Kaplan began to use a rotational linac radiotherapy called \u201cClinac 6\u201d, which was used to concentrate X-rays more deeply thereby they not affecting the skin as much. The development of modern computers enabled three-dimensional X-ray therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using mapping information from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This provides a three-dimensional reconstruction, which helps avoid toxicity since the contours of the tumor are targeted and separated from healthy tissues. In 2003, a specific type of IMRT was developed called the TomoTherapy\u00ae system. This treatment uses CT-guided IMRT technology that directs the radiation source by rotating it around the patient, which makes the morphological limits of a tumor easier to trace with the beam [31]. Another significant trend is the use of charged particle radiotherapy with proton or helium ions for specific types of patients with melanoma of the uveal tract. It is also used as adjuvant therapy for skull base chondroma, chondrosarcoma and spine (usually cervical). In summary, the lines of development have been fractionated dose delivery, technological advances in X-ray production and delivery and improvement of computer-based treatment planning.",

The researchers noted that protection could be transferred to other animals through the use of these antisera, thus beginning what it is known as \u201cserum therapy\u201d for treating infectious diseases (diphtheria and tetanus) in humans. Soon after, these sera elements were described as \u201canti-bodies\u201d because they could be directed not only against toxins, but also against a large variety of organisms and compounds (bacteria, proteins, chemicals, etc.). Immunotherapy initially began with the use of antisera obtained from animals such as horses and sheep containing, among other things, a mixture of antibodies from the activation of different B cell clones, so-called \u201cpolyclonal antibodies\u201d (PAbs). In 1926, Felton and Bailey obtained pure antibodies, but it was not until the 1960s, thanks to the work of Porter and Edelman (1972 Nobel Prize winners), that the Ab structure became known. After the introduction of Abs to therapy, researchers observed that the transferred defense was only temporary (as opposed to vaccination, which induces long-term memory). In addition, it often incurred anaphylactic responses that were occasionally fatal and which greatly reduced their use in human therapy. However, these problems did not prevent PAbs from being used successfully in diagnostictechniques and even in preventive therapies. Anti-snake venom, ant-tetanus and anti-Rh+ gamma globulins are still being used in clinical practice.",

In 1976, genetic studies by Susumu Tonegawa revealed the basis for the vast diversity of antibodies, identifying the process of somatic recombination in immunoglobulin genes [35]. Since the publication of the monoclonal antibody technique, mouse and rat mAbs have been used in many laboratories with thousands of applications in various scientific fields, in diagnostic techniques (clinical, food, environmental), research and in therapy (antitumor, autoimmune diseases). Monoclonal antibodies have helped in the discovery of new molecules (such as the identification of more than 300 membrane proteins, grouped under the CD concept or Cluster of Differentiation), transcription factors, viral, plant and bacterial proteins, phosphorylated compounds involved in death by apoptosis, factors involved in enzymatic cascades and many more. As an example of their usefulness, the current classification of leukemia by the World Health Organization is based on the presence or absence of membrane molecules recognized by monoclonal antibodies that define leucocyte populations in various stages of differentiation.",

Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are not specifically directed to tumor cells and may also affect healthy tissue. Antibodies can provide specificity and lower toxicity, opening new therapeutic possibilities. The first evidence of this potential came in 1982 when a patient suffering from lymphoma responded to treatment using a mouse mAb directed specifically against his tumor B lymphocytes [36]. This response rapidly encouraged research into the production of potentially therapeutic Abs. However, clinical trials results revealed that many patients receiving this therapy developed an immune response directed against the therapeutic Abs, a response known as HAMA (Human Anti-Mouse Antibodies) or HARA (Human Anti-Rat Antibodies). Some even developed anaphylactic reactions, especially after repeated administration. The high immunogenicity of antibodies due to their large size compared to conventional pharmaceutical drugs, and differences in the pattern of glycosylation between murine and human Abs, once again led to the cessation of antibody use in therapy.",

Researchers tried to resolve this problem by immortalizing B cells using the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [37] and by fusing human B cells with well-established murine myeloma (obtaining heterohybridomas) [38]. However, the low production of antibodies in these cells, the instability of heteromyeloma cells and numerous technical problems lead to the search for alternative methods for generating human-like mAbs in the mid-1980s. One of these methods was the modification of murine mAbs through genetic engineering (Figure 2).",

While the expression of chimeric and humanized antibodies was carried out in eukaryotic hosts, such as mammalian or plant cells, bacteria have been the most widely used organism for the production of recombinant antibody fragments [40-42]. However, despite numerous advantages, such as avoiding animal immunization and hybridoma production, their low cost and easier production [43], antibody fragments have shorter circulating half-lives compared to full-size antibodies, lack glycosylation and lack effector functions due to the absence of their Fc region (unless added). Thus, antibody therapies using incomplete antibodies have been relegated to those cases where rapid elimination of antibodies from the blood is required and to local therapy (e.g., macular degeneration). Modified versions, such as PEGylation of fragments (modification of a molecule by linking of one or more polyethylene glycol chains) [44] to improve circulation half-life, glycosylation and Fc region engineering are some of the recent approaches used by researchers to overcome these problems [45].",

The objective is for the antibody to act as a transporter for the cancer-killing agent, concentrating the agent directly in the cancer cell, with minimal damage to healthy cells. Although conjugated antibodies showed toxicity in the past, more recent approaches under development appear to decrease unwanted side effects. Pharmaceutical companies are developing immunoconjugates independently, forming partnerships with specialized players and even acquiring small biotech companies that are focused on the field of immunoconjugates.",

The rapid cellular proliferation of these cells is also exploited by coupling the nanoparticles with different biological agents, such as folic acid. The rationale for coupling these carriers with folic acid is that the folate receptor is over-expressed in a broad range of tumor cell types, including solid and hematological malignancies [57]. Once it has reached the target, the cargo is released into the interior of the cell, and ideally, a signaling marker attached to the vector will aid the physician in visualizing the tumor. Such a vector may also be grafted with a moiety (usually PEG), which retards recognition by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) to increase nanoparticle systemic circulation. In addition to recognition moieties, carried drugs and signaling elements attached to nanoparticles, numerous authors have also envisioned and designed vectors with additional functionalities, including cell-penetrating moieties, combinations of several drugs, combinations of drugs and genes, prodrugs (which become drugs upon biochemical modification by tumor cells), stimulus-sensitive agents that can be externally triggered and molecules for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. The more functionality added to the vector, the better the chances of reaching the target; however, its chances of being detected by the RES also increase. Therefore, currently marketed nanoparticles use passive targeting and active targeted nanoparticles are still being developed. Examples of active targeted nanoparticles are reviewed elsewhere [58].",

For this reason, single-step synthesis of targeted nanoparticles by self-assembling pre-functionalized biomaterials provides a simple and scalable manufacturing strategy [59]. Mass production is also a serious concern and continuous synthesis procedures are therefore still being sought. When using batch reactors to synthesize nanoparticles, several drawbacks usually appear, including: (1) heterogeneous distribution of reactants and temperatures in the reactor; (2) insufficient mixing; (3) variations in the physicochemical characteristics of products from different batches; (4) their inherent discontinuity; and (5) the numerous post-synthesis purification steps that are usually required. In order to overcome these disadvantages, microfluidic reactors (e.g., micromechanized micromixers, capillaries, junctions) have been used in the continuous synthesis of nanoparticles to precisely control reaction temperatures and residence times, thereby rendering nanoparticles with narrow particle-size distributions. Other continuous synthesis processes are usually preferred when synthesizing nanoparticles on a large scale (e.g., laser pyrolysis, arc discharge methods).",

When cells are heated beyond their normal temperature they can become sensitized to conventional therapeutic agents such as radiation and chemotherapy. When high temperatures are used, typically above 43 \u00b0C, the heat causes irreparable damage and results in tumor cell death in a process known as thermal ablation.

Depending on the route of administration, magnetically mediated hyperthermia can be classified into two main types: arterial embolization hyperthermia, where arterial supply is used to deliver magnetic particles into the tumor tissue, and direct intratumoral injection hyperthermia. Magnetic nanoparticles for hyperthermia settings show the advantage of being able to achieve site-specific tumor targeting through the aid of an external magnetic field. Magnetic nanoparticles can also be simultaneously traced using MRI. These nanoparticles are then selectively heated by application of a high frequency alternating magnetic field. Magnetic energy dissipation from the nanoparticles (Brown and N\u00e9el relaxations) induces heating, which produces cell death at temperatures above 43 \u00b0C. Significant antineoplastic effects of MFH treatment were initially observed in animal models of glioma [77] and prostate cancer [78]. Consequently, Phase I and II clinical trials with thermotherapy using magnetic particles have been conducted to treat prostate carcinoma [79] and glioblastoma multiforme [80,81]. It has been demonstrated that magnetic hyperthermia in conjunction with a reduced radiation dose leads to longer survival following diagnosis of first tumor recurrence compared to conventional therapies in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma [81]. Limiting factors of magnetic hyperthermia have been reported, including patient discomfort at high magnetic field strengths as well as irregular intratumoral heat distribution even upon direct intratumoral injection [82].",

A pilot study on patients with refractory head and neck cancer is currently being conducted [89]. Au/AuS sulfide NIR-absorbing nanoparticles (35\u201355 nm) provide higher absorption than nanoshells (98% absorption and 2% scattering for Au/AuS versus 70% absorption and 30% scattering for SiO2/Au nanoshells) as well as potentially better tumor penetration [90]. Other nanoparticles used in NIR include hollow gold nanoparticles, which are smaller than SiO2/Au nanoshells thus giving them prolonged blood circulation half-life and increased chances of reaching the tumors [91]. Maltzahn et al. [92] demonstrated that (PEG)\u2013protected gold nanorods exhibit superior spectral bandwidth, higher photothermal heat generation per gram of gold and longer circulation half-life when compared to gold nanoshells, as well as an approximately two-fold higher X-ray absorption than a clinical iodine contrast agent. NIR-absorbing nanoparticles have also been functionalized with anti-HER2 antibodies to achieve tumor targeting in medulloblastoma cells [93]. Hollow gold nanoparticles were loaded with an a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone analog [90], a potent agonist of melanocortin type-1 receptor overexpressed in melanoma, demonstrating selective photothermal ablation of B16/F10 melanoma. Nanoshells have been loaded into cells of monocyte lineage, which acted as carriers. Once incorporated into human breast tumors in nude mice, the photoinduced cell death of nanoparticle-loaded macrophages was able to induce the death of malignant cells in the tumor's hypoxic microenvironment [94]. Current studies are focused on engineering more efficient NIR-absorbing nanomaterials and on their functionalization with targeting moieties.",

The therapeutic gene material is delivered to specific target cells using efficient vectors that aim to sustain stable, regulated gene expression without creating unwanted side effects. Viral carriers, organic cationic compounds, recombinant proteins and inorganic nanoparticles are the four kinds of carriers currently being explored for gene delivery applications [99,100]. All of them show advantages and disadvantages, but none of them fulfill the criteria for an ideal vector. Indeed, viruses can be regarded as nanoparticles due to their dimensions, regular geometries and well-characterized surface properties. The most widely used viral vectors for gene transfer include adenoviruses (Ad), which are the dominant gene delivery systems in clinical settings, adeno-associated viruses, herpes simplex-1 viruses, retroviruses and lentiviruses [101]. Viruses are very efficient carriers; however, some of them have limited DNA cargo capacity, can cause immunogenicity and toxicity and their manufacture is rather expensive. In general, synthetic delivery systems prevent specific immune responses and may carry higher amounts of material, without strict limitations on the size of the genetic drugs.",

The first clinical trials were approved in 1989, and during the 1990s numerous vectors carrying various therapeutic genes were engineered, and their usefulness was tested in preclinical studies. Due to a simplistic belief in the straightforward success of gene therapy, many of these viral vectors rapidly moved to clinical settings. Although success could be demonstrated in some early clinical studies, even when conducted with far from perfect vectors, serious adverse effects and patient deaths led to rigorous regulation of gene therapy protocols for human use. The evolution of currently successful cancer strategies discussed in Sections 1 and 2 also included significant failures and setbacks, which did not restrain investments in chemotherapy and immunological therapies. However, the pharmaceutical industry has not yet developed a single cancer gene therapy product, and so the development of genetic medicines has been left to academic institutions and small biotechnology companies. In addition, the drawbacks of clinical trials for gene therapy led to extended periods of severe cuts in public research funding. The FDA has not yet approved a human gene therapy product for sale, although gene-related research is growing rapidly and many clinical trials are ongoing. Most of these are in Phase I or II and are aimed at dose determination and toxicity assessment [102]. Due to the unknown safety profile of gene vectors, design and approval of human trials were facilitated for life-threatening diseases. Approximately 1,500 trials have been conducted worldwide since 1989, and more than two-thirds of them were conceived for cancer diseases. Due to the complex nature of cancer, the numerous gene therapy approaches for fighting it include strategies for restoring mutant suppressor gene functions, inactivating oncogenes, expressing suicide genes and eliciting protective immune responses [103]. Oncolytic viruses have also been engineered that exploit tumor cells characteristics by replicating them in these target cells as a method for improving the dissemination of biological agents in solid tumors [104]. For the delivery of therapeutic genes encoding proteins with cytotoxic or anti-angiogenic actions, transcriptional targeting using regulatable promoters has been explored as a way of restricting transgene expression to an optimal therapeutic window [105].",

Since 2004 China has been the only country in the world where gene therapy is licensed for practice. These products are adenoviral vectors marketed under the brand names Gendicine\u2122 and Oncorine\u2122 [106,107]. Gendicine\u2122 is a p53-overexpressing, replication-incompetent Ad for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer in combination with radiotherapy. Oncorine is an E1B-55K-gene-deleted oncolytic Ad, similar to the discontinued Onyx-015 [107]. A few examples of viruses that have almost reached the market are given below. Cerepro\u00ae (sitimagene ceradenovec) is an adenoviral vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene cDNA under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter, manufactured by Ark Therapeutics Ltd., for the treatment of high-grade glioma with oral ganciclovir [108]. Cerepro\u00ae demonstrated significant efficacy in a recent Phase III trial, but a further trial is still required before approval in order to provide a sufficient level of evidence of clinical benefit [109]. Similar to Gendicine\u2122, Advexin\u2122 (contusugene ladenovec; ING21) was developed by Introgen Therapeutics Inc. as a replication-impaired, adenoviral vector carrying the p53 tumor suppressor gene under the control of a constitutive viral promoter. Numerous human cancers have abnormalities in some of the molecules associated with the p53 pathway, contributing to tumor resistance to a variety of conventional therapeutics. Preclinical data has demonstrated increased amounts of p53 wild-typere protein after transduction with Advexin&trade, and Phase II and III trials were conducted in unresectable recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [110]. Responders to the adenovirus therapy had a characteristic p53 profile, with either low expression of mutated p53 or wild-type p53 inactivated by upregulation of inhibitors. Genetic immunotherapy was conceived to deliver immune mediators as an efficient and safe approach that also prevents the need to produce and purify large amounts of recombinant proteins [111]. TNFerade\u2122, developed by GenVec [112], is a second-generation adenovirus vector containing E1, E3 and E4 deletions harboring a TNF-\u03b1 gene, functionally controlled by the radiation-inducible EGR-1 promoter. TNFerade\u2122, was successfully tested in multicenter Phase II and III randomized controlled trials in combination with chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer [113]. Despite initially encouraging results, GenVec stopped the phase III trial in March 2010, as an interim analysis could not demonstrate relevant evidence of effectiveness. An example of a retroviral vector in cancer gene therapy is Rexin-G\u00ae, currently in clinical trials for advanced pancreatic, metastatic breast cancer, osteosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma [114]. Rexin-G\u00ae is a replication-incompetent, collagen-targeted vector, encoding a dominant negative mutant of the human cyclin G1 gene, which makes it lethal to cancer cells [115,116]. Impressive results were obtained in Phase I and II clinical trials, which demonstrated unprecedented tumor control, prolonged survival and clinical remissions in late-stage cancer patients [117].",

            "text": "Genomic and proteomic technologies are quickly evolving to detect specific molecular targets in patient tumor samples, fulfilling the promise of a personalized treatment approach. Information collected from these emerging technologies will help engineer vectors that carry therapeutic genes specifically targeted to the specificities of individual tumor properties. It is now envisioned that future cancer gene therapies will use a combination of viral and non-viral vectors tailored to meet patient-specific tumor characteristics. Consequently, many research groups have focused their efforts on the generation of synthetic carriers that incorporate features that mimic the biological mechanisms of viral gene delivery. The ideal synthetic vector would incorporate a polycationic sequence to condense nucleic acids and a coating to evade the reticuloendothelial system. It would exhibit colloidal stabilization properties to prevent accumulation in the lung capillaries, and would contain specific target-cell entry, endosomal escape and nuclear localization signals. The goal is to synthetically manufacture biodegradable vectors than can be administered systemically to reach micro metastases. These carriers were initially prepared from polymers, lipids and dendrimers [118]. The first non-viral gene therapy trial was conducted in 1991, on patients with advanced melanoma who received intratumor injection of DNA-liposome complexes [119]. The results demonstrated for the first time the safety and feasibility of cancer treatment by gene therapy protocols using non-biological carriers. Cationic polymers have demonstrated superior gene transfer properties to those of polymers having anionic or neutral charge at physiological pH. However, most clinical trials have been conducted with carriers classified as safe [120], such as the nonamine polymers polyvinyl pyrrolidone and poly(lacid co-glycolic acid). Allovectin-7\u2122, a registered trademark of Vical Incorporated (San Diego, CA, USA) is a promising cancer gene therapy product formulated with a cationic lipid system. Allovectin-7\u2122 contains a bicistronic plasmid encoding human leukocyte antigen-B7 and beta-2 microglobulin. This plasmid allows the immune system to recognize metastatic melanoma lesions as foreign by incorporating a MHC class I complex into the tumor through direct injection, as demonstrated in Phase I/II trials [121]. A Phase III trial is currently being conducted to compare the efficacy of Allovectin-7\u2122 to conventional chemotherapy. Encouraging results were also obtained in a recent Phase I trial conducted on women with recurrent, chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer to assess the safety and tolerability of a plasmid carrying the human gene for interleukin-12 plasmid formulated with a synthetic lipopolymer, polyethylene glycol-polyethyleneimine-cholesterol [122]. Currently, numerous nanostructured systems are being developed and tested in preclinical studies. For example, self-assembled nanoparticles containing siRNA, carrier DNA, protamine and lipids, including polyethylene glycol and a ligand, anisamide, to target cancer cells were prepared and tested by Li et al. [123]. These authors demonstrated the high efficiency of these systems in delivering genetic material to xenograft tumors after intravenous administration in athymic nude mice. Folate groups have also been linked to liposomes for siRNA delivery, which resulted in significant suppression of xenograft growth in mice [124]. Folate-PEG-polymeric nanoparticles have also been tested in vivo for suicide gene therapy applications, using ganciclovir as a prodrug [125]. PEG-modified gelatin-based nanocarriers have been used in vivo to deliver plasmid DNA encoding for the soluble form of the extracellular domain of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGF-R1 or sFlt-1) in anti-angiogenic therapy [126]. Upon intravenous administration, overexpressed sFlt-1 was therapeutically active as shown by suppression of the xenograft tumor growth. Nanoparticles also offer the ability to monitor the delivery of genetic material. Tan et al. [127] were able to synthesize chitosan-based nanoparticles encapsulating quantum dots coupled to siRNA and demonstrate efficient silencing and transfection tracking. Finally, inorganic nanoparticles are also under development, which, despite their low synthesis efficiency, have the significant advantage of low toxicity and easy functionalization [100]. For example, magnetic liposomes have also been tested in magnetic hyperthermia settings to induce therapeutic TNF-\u03b1 expression driven by the promoter of the stress-inducible gadd153 gene [128]. The combined thermal and gene therapy treatment significantly arrested tumor growth in nude mice, which encouraged the refinement of this type of cancer gene therapy, which was then successfully tested in preclinical studies [129].",

However, a real breakthrough cannot be claimed in clinical therapy. The reasons for the different outcomes of preclinical and clinical trials include the inherent limitations of rodent models, which develop homogeneous tumors arising from clonal cell lines, while tumors found in clinical practice are composed of heterogeneous cell types. The therapies described in Sections 1 and 2 also confronted similar limitations during their development. The main players in gene therapy, vectors and transgenes, will evolve to achieve the highest possible degree of specificity for targeting cancer cells. Nanotechnology has already engineered powerful non-biological carriers of a variety of therapeutic genes that have demonstrated efficacy and safety in preclinical tests. Since current knowledge of cancer cell biology is far from complete, ongoing and future clinical trials with these synthetic systems are expected to suffer similar drawbacks in terms of efficacy as those experienced with viral gene therapy systems. As we have seen from other therapies that have already been incorporated into the clinical routine of cancer treatment, the success of cancer gene therapies will be preceded by many failures, which will likely be due to a greater extent to our technological limitations than to flaws in their general concept.",
