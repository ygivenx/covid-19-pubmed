            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) originated in China towards the end of 2002 and quickly spread to about 30 countries by 2003 causing over 800 deaths worldwide\n[1-4]. The etiological agent of the disease, the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified and classified as a unique member of beta Coronavirus. The SARS-CoV carries a ~30 kb positive-sense RNA genome that contains 8 unique open reading frames (ORFs) in addition to the common coronaviral genes\n[5,6]. The Orf3A is the largest among these ORFs and encodes a protein of 274 amino acids, the deletion of which reduces SARS-CoV replication in cell cultures and murine models of infection\n[7]. Antibodies against the 3a protein were also found in the sera of SARS patients\n[8]. Following infection of Vero E6 or CaCo2 cells, the 3a protein was found to be associated with virus particles\n[9,10] and localized to the plasma membrane and perinuclear regions of infected cells\n[11]. Several studies including ours have shown the 3a protein to induce apoptosis in host cell\n[12-14], which is also linked to its ability to form ion channels\n[15]. The 3a protein also promotes osteoclastogenesis by increasing NF-kB activity\n[16], and we have shown it to cause ER stress and induce down-regulation of the type 1 interferon receptor\n[14,17].",

            "text": "The 3a protein contains three transmembrane domains at the N-terminus and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ~150 amino acids\n[18]. The cytoplasmic domain contains a tyrosine based sorting motif, YXX\u03a6 (where X can be any residue and \u03a6 is a residue with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) and a di-acidic EXD motif. It has been hypothesized that these motifs assist the 3a protein in regulating internalization of the viral Spike (S) protein from cell surface to intracellular sites\n[19]. In a study by Tan et al., the 3a protein lacking both of these motifs failed to express on the cell surface\n[11]. It has also been reported that the 3a protein is released in membranous structure from cell and mutation in the YXX\u03a6 or EXD motif does not impact the release\n[20]. Tyrosine based sorting motifs are responsible for AP-2 mediated internalization from the cell surface by interacting with \u03bc2 subunit of the clathrin complex\n[21]. However the YXX\u03a6 motif can also mediate interaction with other members of the clathrin complex including AP-1, AP-3 and AP-4 for transport to different destinations inside the cell\n[22]. For example, the YXX\u03a6 motif has been shown to be required for lysosomal targeting of some proteins like the CD3 chain of the T-cell receptor\n[23]. The di-acidic motif functions as a canonical ER export signal by mediating interaction with COPII vesicles\n[24-27] and has been shown to mediate efficient transport of the KAT1 ion channel protein to the plasma membrane\n[28]. However the functions of these individual motifs within the 3a protein have not been understood properly.",

Lipid droplets are intracellular storage organelles consisting of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids\n[33]. Many proteins have been identified on lipid droplets that are also involved in vesicular transport, membrane fusion and cytoskeletal mobility. Among these are Perilipin A, Caveolins, Phospholipase D, and members of the Rab and ARF families of small GTPases\n[34-38]. Among viral proteins, the core proteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and GB virus B (GBV-B) are known to be associated with lipid droplets\n[39]. Recent views of lipid droplets emphasize that these might also act as storage vesicles for excess and unfolded proteins\n[34,40].",

The cytoplasmic domain of 3a also contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif, YXX\u03a6 (aa 160\u2013163) and a di-acidic motif, EXD (aa 171\u2013173). We compared the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV 3a protein from several human and bat isolates available in NCBI database (Table \n1). YXX\u03a6 motif is conserved in all the isolates studied where as the EXD motif is mutated in all the seven bat isolates and one out of 21 human isolates. The EXD motif was proposed to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export signal whereas the YXX\u03a6 motif was shown to be crucial for endocytosis from the cell surface\n[19]. The topology of the 3a protein is such that the N-terminus is exposed to the outside of plasma membrane\n[11]. To study its cell surface distribution, we made expression constructs for the 3a protein and its mutants with a N-terminal Myc-tag. The 3a protein was expressed in four different cell lines \u2013 COS-7, HT29, MDCK and Huh7 and showed intracellular as well as surface localization in all cell types (Figure \n2A). This result is consistent with previous reports showing the membrane distribution of the 3a protein\n[11].",

The cell surface distribution was observed in non-permeabilized cells with the antibodies against the N-terminal Myc-tag. Staining of permeabilized cells with antibodies against the cytoplasmic region (aa 126\u2013274) of the 3a protein was used to see its total expression and intracellular distribution. The wild type 3a protein was found to localize to the plasma membrane as well as to intracellular regions that appeared to be perinuclear and showed a punctate distribution (Figure \n2B). The Cyto3a protein that lacks the transmembrane domains showed similar intracellular distribution, but was expectedly not found on the plasma membrane (Figure \n2B). Surprisingly, the \u0394YXX\u03a6 protein with mutations in the tyrosine-based sorting motif was mainly localized in the perinuclear compartment (Figure \n2B). On the other hand, the \u0394EXD protein with the mutations in the diacidic motif distributed similar to the wild type protein. Since an N-terminal myc tag was present on all the proteins and was likely to be exposed extracellularly, staining non-permeabilized cells with the anti-myc antibodies confirmed the plasma membrane localization and proper topology of the 3a proteins. Only the wild type and \u0394EXD proteins stained with anti-myc antibodies in non-permeabilized cells. These results showed that the 3a proteins are expressed with the correct topology of extracellular N-terminus and cytoplasmic C-terminus. The \u0394YXX\u03a6 mutant protein saturated in the intracellular compartment, but was not found at the plasma membrane, showing this tyrosine-based sorting motif to be important for its trafficking to the cell surface. The di-acidic motif, which is a canonical ER export signal, did not show any role in the intracellular trafficking of the 3a protein.",

To further characterize the compartments to which the mutant 3a proteins localize, we expressed them in Huh7 cells together with markers for the ER and Golgi compartments. The wild type and \u0394EXD proteins were distributed to the cell surface and punctate structures that are likely to represent trafficking vesicles; these also showed minor colocalization with the Golgi compartment (Figure \n3A). However, the \u0394YXX\u03a6 mutant protein was localized exclusively to the Golgi compartment (Figure \n3A). Two subcellular distribution patterns were observed for the proteins. While the first consisted of a predominantly dispersed cytoplasmic and plasma membrane localization with a minor fraction of the protein in the Golgi compartment, the other showed a Golgi-saturated pattern. These distribution patterns for the proteins were quantified in multiple cells using the Golgi marker. An overwhelming majority of cells expressing wild type 3a or its \u2206EXD mutant showed the first pattern, while all of the cells expressing the YXX\u03a6 mutant showed the second pattern of localization (Figure\n3B). The wild type 3a and \u2206EXD proteins appear to be rapidly sorted from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the di-acidic motif does not function as an ER export signal in this protein; if this was the case, the \u2206EXD mutant protein would have been retained in the ER. None of the proteins showed any significant localization with the ER marker. The \u0394YXX\u03a6 mutant protein was retained in the Golgi complex but not in the ER region or at the plasma membrane, suggesting that the tyrosine-based sorting motif is crucial for the sorting of the 3a protein from Golgi to the plasma membrane.",

To visualize lipid droplets we used the specific dye Nile Red to stain transfected cells grown in culture media containing free fatty acids. On costaining with Nile Red, ~50% of the wild type 3a protein was found to be associated with lipid droplets, but the Cyto3a protein did not show any significant colocalization, indicating that the transmembrane region of the 3a protein was required for its targeting to lipid droplets (Figure \n4).

To investigate this, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed, which showed the mRNA levels of the wild type and mutant 3a proteins to be similar (Figure \n5A right panel). This indicated that the mutant protein was either unstable or was actively degraded in the transfected cells. To explore this, we performed an in vitro transcription-translation experiment and found similar levels of the wild type and \u0394YXX\u03a6 mutant 3a proteins (Figure \n5B), which supported the intracellular degradation model. Since the mutant protein was retained in lipid droplets, we hypothesized that this would lead to increased autophagy or lysosomal degradation. In fact, the \u0394YXX\u03a6 mutant protein localized with late endosome/lysosomal marker Rab7 (Figure \n5C). To further confirm lysosomal degradation of the mutant protein, we used two inhibitors \u2013 Brefeldin A, which blocks ER-to-Golgi transport and Aprotinin A, which inhibits lysosomal proteases. Both of these led to 3 to 5 fold increased levels of the \u0394YXX\u03a6 mutant protein (Figure \n5D). These findings clearly demonstrate that mutation of the tyrosine-based sorting motif causes abnormal trafficking of the 3a protein leading to increased accumulation in the Golgi compartment and lipid droplets and subsequent degradation in the lysosomal compartment.",

In fact, inhibitors of autophagy and proteosomal degradation led to increased protein levels and lipid droplet association of Apolipoprotein B\n[37]. We observed that reduced protein levels of \u2206YXX\u03a6 mutant were associated with increased lysosomal degradation. There was a 3 to 5 fold increase in \u2206YXX\u03a6 protein levels on treatment with Brefeldin A or Aprotinin. Based on these data, we put forward a new model of intracellular distribution of the 3a protein (Figure \n6). We propose that the wild type 3a protein is sorted efficiently from the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane. The \u2206YXX\u03a6 mutant fails to reach the plasma membrane as it gets stuck in the Golgi compartment. This mutant protein is then targeted to lipid droplets and ultimately to the protein degradation machinery.",
