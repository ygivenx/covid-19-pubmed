Phage display has also become a promising epitope mapping method, which has been applied in many fields such as allergology[9] and oncology[10]. The phage display based epitope mapping is usually accomplished through comparing the sequence of mimotopes (antibody-selected phage displayed peptides) to the antigen. In some cases, the mimotope sequence is identical or very similar to a sequence in the antigen[2], there by indicating the location of the native epitope. These cases are rare however, and usually the mimotope sequence has little, if any, similarity with the antigen sequence. Compared with traditional epitope mapping methods such as solving the crystal structure of the antigen-antibody complex or scanning overlapping peptides of the antigen, phage display based epitope mapping is generally much cheaper and less arduous.",

            "text": "Though epitope mapping based on phage display can be done manually[11], it is quite tedious and time-consuming to compare a set of mimotopes to the antigen without computational support. The low sequence similarity between the mimotope and the antigen often makes the mapping even harder. To solve these problems, several groups have researched algorithms and programs that assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping [12-17]. According to their dependency on antigen structure, the existing programs for phage display based epitope mapping can be classified into three categories. Program in the first category such as FINDMAP, only work with sequence data from the mimotopes and antigen[13]. The second category needs both the sequence data and the antigen structure. SiteLight[12], 3DEX[14], and Mapitope[16,17] belong to this category. A very recently published work: MIMOP[15] makes the third category, which integrates the two different approaches and can work with or without the antigen structure. Though implemented differently, all the existing programs have succeeded in given cases. However, most of the existing tools have not been implemented as a freely available online service until now, making it less convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate them.",

The consensus sequence, or a single mimotope sequence, can then be mapped on to the antigen structure, and potential epitopes determined by spatial clustering of the mapped residues. The results mapped on to the antigen's 3D structure can then be viewed interactively.

In the first section, MIMOX provides a simple interface for ClustalW[19] to align a set of mimotope sequences; this is implemented as the script mimosa.pl. The alignment can then be used to derive the consensus sequence through a simple statistical method; this is implemented as the script mimocs.pl. The alignment can also be viewed and managed through an embedded Java applet version of JalView[20]; this is implemented as the script jalviews.pl. In the second section, MIMOX tries to map the user supplied sequence on to the given antigen structure. This is implemented as the script mimox.pl. The program NACCESS[21] is also wrapped into mimox.pl and used to calculate the surface accessibility of the mapping results. All mapping results are ranked based on their solvent accessible surface. Each mapping result has detailed information of the accessibility of each candidate residue, which is parsed through the script parsa.pl and displayed as a table in a new window. Each mapping result can also be viewed interactively on the antigen structure. This is implemented as the script jmol.pl, which wraps a Java applet version of Jmol[22]. The overall architecture of MIMOX is shown schematically in Figure 1.",

If the sum frequency of similar residue at the same position is above the threshold, the similar residues are also regarded as motif residues. In MIMOX, there are five similar residue groups (L, I, V; T, S; E, D; Q, N; K, R; F, W); other residues are considered unique. This classification scheme is the same as that used by Mapitope[16,17]. If no motif residue is found at a given position, then X is used to stand for any amino acid residue. Motif residues at all positions of the alignment are then displayed in a table. Thus a consensus sequence is suggested by the program.

If the distance between two residues is below the threshold, the two residues are taken as a neighbour pair. MIMOX provides three methods to calculate neighbour residue pairs. One method is to take the distance between the C\u03b1 atoms of the two amino acids as the distance between the two residues. Using C\u03b1 atoms may better reflect the backbone positions. The second method is to use the distance between the C\u03b2 atoms, which may better reflect the side chain position (C\u03b1 atom is still used when it is a glycine because it does not have a C\u03b2 atom). The third method described below, is based on the distances between all the heavy atoms of the two amino acids. All of the distances mentioned above are Euclidean distances, calculated as:",

In 1999, Jesaitis and co-workers used an anti-actin polyclonal antibody to select a phage displayed random peptide library; VPHPTWMR was one of the consensus sequences they derived from the selected mimotopes. They manually mapped VPHPTWMR to the known structure of actin [PDB: 1ATN] and suggested that it might correspond to residues: V129, P130, H101, P102, T358, W356, M355, R372[11]. In 2003, Mumey et al used FINDMAP to align VPHPTWMR to the actin sequence without utilizing information on the antigen structure. The result from FINDMAP shows VPHPTWMR can be mapped to residues as V129, P130, H101, P102, T103, W356, M355, R372[13]. FINDMAP mapped the input sequence to a slightly different set of residues (using T103 instead of T358). When running MIMOX with all parameters as defaults, we got no result. However, after the distance threshold is changed to 12 \u00c5 (the maximum distance allowed in MIMOX), we find that the two mappings above are returned as candidate cluster 5 and candidate cluster 17. As the side chain of some amino acids (such as arginine) can span a distance as great as 12 \u00c5, MIMOX takes this value as the maximum allowable distance. This distance restriction is also used by Mapitope[16,17]. In this case, the need for the higher distance threshold is due to R372 which lies some distance from the other mapped residues. MIMOX also suggested other possibilities such as cluster 1(V96, P102, H101, P130, T358, W356, M355, R372) which has a bigger solvent accessible surface, and cluster 26 (V96, P98, H101, P102, T103, W356, M355, R372), which clearly has 3 sequential segments, i.e. VPHPT, WM, and R.",

This interactive process gives hints to users step by step and greatly decreases the load of the server and prevents the loss of some reasonable results.

This allows users to find the reasonable results by themselves based on their background knowledge on a given antibody, a given antigen and a given phage display experiment.

First, the program divides native protein surface into overlapping patches based on geodesic distances between residues; then aligns each mimotope in the library with each patch and scores and sorts them; finally, high scoring matches are selected iteratively until 25% of the native protein is covered[12]. Another program 3DEX was implemented in Visual Basic and could only run on Windows. It divides a sequence into a set of overlapping subsequences with a user-defined length (3-maximum length of mimotope). Then, it searches for matching residues at each position of the above subsequences against the sequence or PDB structure of native protein and links the neighbours iteratively until the first subsequence is complete. This is repeated for the following subsequences to complete the mimotope and return the result[14]. Mapitope was also implemented in C++ and its algorithm was first described by Enshell-Seijffers in 2003. Briefly, Mapitope deconvolutes a set of mimotope sequences into a set of overlapping amino acids pairs (AAP). Then a set of major statistically significant pairs (SSP) are identified based on the AAP. Later, the SSP are mapped and clustered in the antigen structure. Finally, the most elaborate and diverse clusters on the antigen surface are identified and regarded as the predicted epitope candidates[16,17].",

One is called MimAlign, which can predict potential epitopic regions (PER) from mimotope and antigen sequences, and from the antigen structure if available. The other called MimCons, can predict PER from mimotope sequences but requires the antigen structure[15]. It seems that MIMOP can work with or without the antigen structure from the published case studies. However, the sequence of the only case that is independent of antigen structure is just a continuous subsequence of the antigen sequence. Thus, more studies are still needed to prove that MimAlign can work without antigen structure information.",
