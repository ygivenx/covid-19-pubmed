            "text": "Signal intensity changes in the vertebral endplate and subchondral bone marrow on magnetic resonance imaging, also known as Modic changes (MCs), are often observed in patients with degenerative spinal diseases [1]. Three different types have been described. Type I changes are hypointense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and indicate edema and hypervascularity in the lesions as confirmed histologically. Type II changes are hyperintense on T1WI and isointense or hyperintense on T2WI and reflect fatty replacement of the red bone marrow. Type III changes are hypointense on both T1WI and T2WI and represent subchondral bone sclerosis. MCs are strongly associated with intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain [2]\u2013[4]. Identification of the mechanisms and factors involved in the progression of MCs is of great importance for clinical interventions to repair or retard the development of MCs. To exploit the mechanisms of MCs, it is necessary to understand the pathophysiological changes of the vertebral cartilage endplate with MCs at the molecular level. Comprehensive evaluation of gene expression patterns is important for understanding the biological processes occurring in vertebral cartilage endplate with MCs.",

Gene expression analysis in cartilage has been satisfactorily performed in recent years since the major problem of poor ribonucleic acid (RNA) content in human cartilage is compensated by improving the RNA yield and quality and via cDNA amplification by in vitro transcription [7]\u2013[10]. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is currently one of the most precise and frequently-used methods to study the expression profiles of genes; it can quantify both the absolute and relative amounts of a gene\u2019s RNA [11], [12]. Relative quantification is more common in qRT-PCR, and its accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility are highly dependent on the choice of suitable internal controls within each sample to normalize experimental variations [13]. The use of reference genes can correct biases caused by variations in RNA input, or reverse transcription efficiency, or amplification efficiency.",

Although several genes are commonly used as controls (such as GAPDH, ACTB, and 18S rRNA), they are also regulated and can be expressed at varying levels [11]. The use of inappropriate reference genes may weaken the detection sensitivity of the target genes and even lead to wrong results [14], [15]. Therefore, the expression stability of potential reference genes should be explored in each specific tissue and experimental situation. And the use of more than one reference gene is required for high-quality data, as suggested by many investigators [13], [16].",

Similarly, TBP was relatively stable in samples from MC types II and III, however, it was ranked lower in MC type I. Therefore, even for a tissue with different subtypes of pathologic change, previous testing of the stability of reference genes is required.",

GeNorm analyzes the expression stability of the tested genes in all samples, and ranks them according to a stability measure [16]. In contrast, NormFinder evaluates the expression stability of each single reference gene independently, and takes into account intra- and inter-group variations for normalization [13]. While BestKeeper analyzes the stability of candidate reference genes depending on the standard deviation and coefficient of variance of their Ct values. Together they seek genes with stable expression levels, by either the relative stability with reference to other candidates, or to clinically-relevant groups, or to their intrinsic degree of variation [13], [16], [22]. The use of these programs provides complementary information. Because of the distinct statistical algorithms used by these three programs, it was not surprising that they gave somewhat different results. Nevertheless, there was general agreement; SDHA was in the top two positions and RPL13A in the last two in all samples and subsets for these three programs.",
