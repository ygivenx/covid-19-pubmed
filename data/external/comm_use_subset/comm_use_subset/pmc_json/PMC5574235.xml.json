            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, a newly identified pathogen, causes severe pneumonia in humans, with a mortality of nearly 44%. Human-to-human spread has been demonstrated, raising the possibility that the infection could become pandemic [1]. A colorized electron micrograph shows the coronavirus MERS-CoV acute viral respiratory illness that is characterized primarily by cough, fever, and shortness of breath and is sometimes associated with severe and potentially fatal complications such as pneumonia and kidney failure. The illness was first observed in June 2012 in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, and soon afterward it was reported in other countries in the Middle East, including Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It later was detected in Europe, including cases in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom; in the North African country of Tunisia; and in countries more distant from the Middle East, including China, Malaysia, South Korea, and the United States. The largest MERS outbreak outside Saudi Arabia occurred in 2015, when an individual who had recently traveled to the Middle East subsequently fell ill in South Korea, transmitting the disease to close contacts. The dissemination of the disease by infected travelers leaving the Middle East suggested that MERS had the potential to escalate into an international public health emergency. The possibility of a pandemic was thought to be impeded, however, by the limited ability of the disease to be passed from one person to another. MERS is caused by a coronavirus known as MERS-CoV, which attacks the respiratory system. The recently defined receptor for MERS-CoV, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), is generally expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells and has been shown to be present on cultured human nonciliated bronchiolar epithelium cells, providing further information on the respiratory tropism of MERS-CoV [2]. Symptoms of illness appear anytime from 2 to 14 days following infection. Cough, fever, and shortness of breath are the primary symptoms, but others such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and myalgia (muscle pain) can also occur. In some persons, infection produces no symptoms or only mild cold-like symptoms, whereas in others, particularly in persons with underlying medical conditions, infection can produce severe illness [3].",

The infected cells produce new viruses at the rate d1N during their life, on average having the length 1/d1, where N > 0 is some integer number.

Infected cells are produced from uninfected cells and free viruses at the rate (\u03b2D(t))v(t)T(t). It is assumed that DPP4 is produced from the surface of uninfected cells at the constant rate \u03bb1 > 0. DPP4 is destroyed, when free viruses try to infect uninfected cells, at the rate \u03b21(\u03b2D(t))v(t)T(t), and is hydrolyzed at the rate \u03b3D(t). Here, \u03b21 \u2265 0 and \u03b3 > 0 are constants. It is assumed that there is no undestroyed DPP4 on the surface of infected cells. All other parameters in model (2) have similar biological meanings to that in model (1).",

If R0 = 1, f(\u03c1) = 0 has the zero root \u03c1 = 0 and three negative roots. Hence, E0 is linearly stable.Construct the Lyapunov function as follows: (6)UT,I,v,D=T0TT0\u22121\u2212ln\u2061TT0+1+\u03b21I+1+\u03b21Nv+D0DD0\u22121\u2212ln\u2061DD0.It is clear that U is continuous on \u03a91 and positive definite with respect to E0 and satisfies condition (ii) of Definition 1.1 in [14] or Lemma 3.1 in [15] on \u2202\u03a9 = \u03a9\u2216\u03a91.

Thus, we have T = T\u2217, D = D\u2217.On the other hand, notice the inequality in [16]: (12)\u2212xz2+yz\u2264\u221212xz2+y22xx>0,  y\u22650,  z\u22650.We have (13)\u2212\u03b21dTT\u2212T\u22172\u221212\u03b2\u03b21vD\u2212D\u2217T\u2212T\u2217\u2212\u03b3DD\u2212D\u22172\u221212\u03b2\u03b21vD\u2212D\u2217T\u2212T\u2217\u2264\u2212\u03b21d2TT\u2212T\u22172+D\u03b2\u03b21v28\u03b3T\u2212T\u22172\u2212\u03b32DD\u2212D\u22172+T\u03b2\u03b21v28\u03b21dD\u2212D\u22172=\u2212\u03b21d2T\u2212D\u03b2\u03b21v28\u03b3T\u2212T\u22172\u2212\u03b32D\u2212T\u03b2\u03b21v28\u03b21dD\u2212D\u22172.Note that the inequalities \u03b21d/2T \u2212 D(\u03b2\u03b21v)2/8\u03b3 \u2265 0 and \u03b3/2D \u2212 T(\u03b2\u03b21v)2/8\u03b21d \u2265 0 are equivalent to the inequality 4d\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b21\u03b22TDv2. Since T(t) \u2264 T0, D \u2264 D0, and v(t) \u2264 \u03bbN/\u03bca for all t \u2265 0, we have that the inequality 4d\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b21\u03b22TDv2 holds, if the condition (2d\u03b3\u03bca)2 \u2265 \u03b21\u03b22\u03bb1\u03bb3N2 in Theorem 2 is satisfied. Therefore, dW/dt \u2264 0 on \u03a92.Define Q = {dW/dt = 0\u2223(T, I, v, D) \u2208 \u03a9, W(T, I, v, D) < +\u221e}. Let M be the largest subset in Q which is invariant with respect to the set of model (2). Hence, we have that M \u2282 Q \u2282 {(T, I, v, D)\u2223(T, I, v, D) \u2208 \u03a9, T = T\u2217, D = D\u2217}. From the invariance of M and model (2), we can also show that M = {E\u2217}. Hence, it follows from Theorem 1.2 in [14] or Lemma 3.1 in [15] that E\u2217 is globally attractive. This completes the proof.\n",

If some drug treatment measures are taken, the effectiveness of the treatment can be reflected in the regulation of the parameter \u03b3. For example, by increasing the value of \u03b3, the value of the basic reproductive ratio of R0 can be changed from greater than 1 to less than 1.
