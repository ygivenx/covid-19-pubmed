The first two division cycles contain a very low percentage of T cells both in the presence or absence of exosomes indicating that the effect of the polyclonal stimulation starts after these two division cycles, nevertheless the presence of exosomes are still significantly retaining cells in these firs two division cycles (although this is happening in a group of T cells below 10%). The statistical analysis showed that, significant differences were found in different division cycles either in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

The stimulation index of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD2/anti-CD3/anti-CD28 was 692.3 and 655.6, respectively.

Considering that IFN-\u03b3 is crucial for protection against immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, we could assume that exo-hASCs could be used as ideal vehicles for a local immunosuppression. Moreover, in contrast to cell therapy, where the viability, homing, or implantation of individual cells is compromised, the usage of well-characterized exo-hASCs in a dosing regimen that can be controlled and defined in space and time could be considered an advantage (45). Additionally, several authors have reported the susceptibility of allogeneic cells to CD8+ T cells and NK cells, which is an important issue for the clinical efficacy of MSCs (46).
