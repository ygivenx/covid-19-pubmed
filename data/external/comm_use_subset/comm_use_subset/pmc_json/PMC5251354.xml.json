It possesses a positive sense single\u2013stranded RNA genome that ranges from 27 to 31 Kb.2 The number of IBV serotypes that exist throughout the world is unknown. More than 50 different serotypes have been listed and new IBV variants continue to emerge.3 It is now well documented that a considerable number of different serotypes with antigenic and pathogenic differences exist in poultry industry of different parts of the world.4",

Their results showed that two farms were just infected with 793/B type, one with an unknown strain and five with Sul/ 01/09.10 Jahantigh et al. conducted a work to identify the infectious bronchitis virus with group-specific primers in Zabol, south-east of Iran. Their results showed that 36.36% of the sampled flocks were positive to IBV by RT-PCR.24 Also, in Jordan, there are studies that have detected the presence of IBV, like Ark, DE-072, and Mass-like serotypes.25 Another study of Jordan showed that sampled flocks have Mass, 4/91, and D274 isolates, respectively.26 However, D274 genotype was not detected in the present study.",

According to 4/91 based vaccination strategies applied in Iraq, 4/91-type IBVs could be vaccine-derived, however, this high prevalence rate also may reflect the weak biosecurity systems and uncontrolled entering of broiler chicks from other Iraqi governorates or intense trading with neighboring countries (Turkey, Iran, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia).",

Some IBV variants, such as 793/B or QX that have been spread over Asia, Europe, and Africa in a short period, have not been reported in the USA or Australia. It seems likely that geographical isolation and control measures employed in countries may play a significant role in preventing entry of IBV variants. The recent discoveries of IBV and IBV-like strains in other species of birds other than the chicken,27 like geese, ducks, and pigeons, might also play roles in the spread of IBV strains over the world. Specific IBV strains that were able to infect another bird species, especially if it is a migratory bird, would spread more easily over long distances than a strain that could not replicate in that bird species.",

By utilizing diagnostic techniques such as those were used in this study, it is possible to conduct a detailed epidemiological investigation of this disease. Despite the use of H120 and 4/91 vaccines in Iraq, it is common to find IB problems in vaccinated chickens. In the present study, the sequencing of PCR products was not performed, therefore, the origin of these types is not clear at present. Future work should include the sequencing of IBV strains in the region in order to determine the type of unknown strains and to choose the suitable vaccination program.",
