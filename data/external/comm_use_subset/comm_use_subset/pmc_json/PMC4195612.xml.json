            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder, in which the improper activation of the host\u2019s immune system results in demyelinated lesions, predominantly in the brain and spinal cord. Typically diagnosed in young adults, the progressive neurodegeneration can have a dramatic impact on their quality of life. As the disease progresses, the prevalence and severity of LUTS often parallel the disease progression [1]. A collection of symptoms including urgency and frequency of micturition, incontinence, incomplete emptying, hesitancy, weak urine stream and urinary retention are common in MS patients, as well as other patients with neurogenic bladder [2], [3]. Neuronal control over bladder function is coordinated by the pontine storage and micturition centers in the brain stem, which sends projections to regions of the lumbosacral spinal cord coordinating parasympathetic outflow to the detrusor. It is thought that the hyperreflexia observed in neurogenic bladder dysfunction may be a result of impaired neuronal connections between these areas of the spinal cord and the pontine micturition center [4].",

One such environmental variable that may trigger an immune response to self-antigens is viral infection. Virus-induced models of demyelinating disease are available [5], [6], but rarely used to study neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a rodent model of MS that is used more frequently to study neurogenic bladder dysfunction. It is initiated by injections with myelin basic protein, or spinal cord homogenates, with adjuvants to initiate the immune response. Animals with EAE show micturition symptoms common to MS patients, including detrusor hyperactivity [7], [8], shortened intermicturition intervals, decreased voiding volumes, morphology changes and fibrosis in the bladder [9], [10]. However, while EAE produces chronic inflammation in the CNS, it has an unclear onset and limited demyelination and neurodegeneration [11].",

A better understanding of the pathological changes in bladder innervation and effects of nerve degeneration on the contractile mechanisms of the detrusor will lead to the development of much-needed treatment options for this subset of patients.

A Clinical Symptom Score (CSS) was determined for each animal following induction of CIE based on the following observations: 0, normal with no clinical signs; 1, loss of tail tonicity/kyphosis; 2, tail paralysis/severe kyphosis; 3, partial hind limb paralysis; 4, complete hind limb paralysis; 5, complete hind limb paralysis and forelimb paresis/paralysis. In this model, most animals show significant CSS scores within a few days and the CSS score peaks 2 weeks post-inoculation and then declines [14], [15]. Thus, CSS scores were determined for each animal until the CSS score declined for 3 days, usually during the second week. The average maximum CSS was 2.0\u00b10.12 for the 54 animals used in this study. The majority of animals with a CSS of 4\u20135 do not survive the acute phase of encephalitis (two animals in this study survived with a peak CSS of 5 during acute infection, none with a CSS of 4). Demyelinated lesions in the CNS are apparent at this time point, as previously established with this model [16], [17], however we observed no demyelination in the bladder wall at week 4 post-infection (Figure 1).

The average maximum CSS for the mice used in this study was 2.0\u00b10.12 (range 1\u20135). Most mice had a CSS maximum of 1 or 2. There were no statistically significant correlations between CSS score and any outcome measure in this study including: the potassium-induced contraction, nerve-mediated maximal contraction, bethanechol-induced maximal contraction or bethanechol potency, the purinergic-induced maximal contraction, the potency of \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP, or the percent of the purinergic and cholinergic components of nerve mediated contraction. Mice with CIE (N = 54) weighed significantly less (p<0.01) than controls (N = 40, 24.9\u00b10.3 and 26.8\u00b10.3 g, respectively), whereas the weight of bladders from mice with CIE was not different in comparison to the bladders from control mice (23.5\u00b11 mg and 23.1\u00b10.5 mg, respectively). Subsequent to the in\nvitro contractility studies, the length and weight of each bladder strip was measured to determine cross-sectional area (CXA; Figure 2). There was no difference in the CXA between mucosa denuded CIE (0.21\u00b10.01 mm2) and mucosa denuded control bladder strips (0.21\u00b10.01 mm2). However, in mucosa intact bladder strips, the CXA was significantly (p<0.01) greater in bladder strips from CIE (0.41\u00b10.02 mm2) compared to control mice (0.29\u00b10.01 mm2). This suggests there is mucosal hypertrophy, but not muscle hypertrophy in CIE mice bladders. Histological examination of the tissues (Figure 3) confirmed a significant increase in the thickness of the submucosal layer in CIE bladders (221.4\u00b192 \u00b5m) compared to control bladders (35.3\u00b19.0 \u00b5m). The urothelial layer in CIE bladders (28.6\u00b12.4 \u00b5m) was not different from control bladders (33.19\u00b15.1 \u00b5m). In addition, the thickness of the detrusor smooth muscle layer was similar in CIE and controls (153.3\u00b111 and 192.6\u00b133 \u00b5m, respectively). Staining for myelin basic protein was observed within the bladder wall and pudendal nerve of CIE mice, showing similar patterns to age matched control mice (Figure 1), thus no evidence of peripheral demyelination was observed in this model.",

This suggests that CIE does not induce a deficit in the ability of the muscle to generate force.

Although gross histological analysis of bladders from CIE and control mice showed no substantial differences in our previous report [14], detailed quantitative histological analysis of the bladders from CIE mice presented here demonstrated organ-level hypertrophy that appeared to be a result of edema, primarily in the submucosal layer. No granulocytes were observed, and few lymphocytes, suggesting the edema may be related to increased permeability rather than inflammation. This idea is supported by a previous study demonstrating increased urothelial permeability within several hours of spinal cord injury in rats [18].

ACh and ATP are both released from terminals of parasympathetic nerves during micturition; however the relative contribution of each cotransmitter is known to vary by species and disease state [19]. The influence of the mucosa on bladder contraction also varies by species. For example, in pig bladders the mucosa suppresses contraction [20], whereas in normal mice the mucosa potentiates contractile responses, both to bethanechol and electric field stimulation (nerve-evoked contractions). There is a role for an \u201catropine resistant\u201d (non-cholinergic) component of normal bladder contraction in many mammals, excluding man [21]. In normal mice, a purinergic component of nerve-evoked contractions was observed, reaching a magnitude of approximately 40% of the maximum nerve-evoked contraction without atropine. The removal of the mucosa did not alter the relative magnitude of either the purinergic or cholinergic components of nerve-evoked contractions (Figure 8), but did decrease their absolute magnitude. However, in CIE mice, the mucosa no longer enhances the magnitude of the nerve-evoked or bethanechol-induced contraction. Instead, mucosa from CIE mouse bladder decreases the cholinergic component of nerve-evoked contraction, while augmenting the purinergic component. This is consistent with an increased role for ATP observed in various human bladder pathologies, such as outlet obstruction due to enlarged prostate [22], overactive bladder, neurogenic bladder, and interstitial cystitis [23]. As previously mentioned, human bladder strips do not show atropine-resistant contractions in the absence of pathology [22], [23].",

The augmentation of nerve-evoked and bethanechol-induced contractions observed in mucosa intact age matched controls is lost in CIE bladders. Rather, the presence of the mucosa in intact CIE bladders decreased the relative magnitude of the cholinergic component and enhanced the purinergic component of nerve-evoked contractions without altering the magnitude of the contractile response. Therefore, it is evident that the relative contribution of the two neurotransmitters is influenced by the presence of the mucosa. This may be, in part, due to altered release of various substances influencing smooth muscle contraction, or perhaps to alterations in the interstitial cells relaying mucosal signals to smooth muscle of the detrusor.",

There is also evidence for a mucosal-derived, yet unidentified, factor that inhibits bladder contraction [27], [28].

Increased spermidine production and release has been shown in cultured urothelial cells from patients with overactive bladder [26]. Polyamines including spermidine also have been shown to inhibit ACh-induced contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle [30] and trigger relaxation of ACh-induced contractions in the rat bladder [29].

This dysfunction may be related to the altered urothelial release of mediators of contraction described above, and/or altered permeability which is supported by the edema found in the submucosal layer, creating organ-level hypertrophy. Additionally, changes in expression levels of several receptors have been shown in EAE mice (a different model of MS), including an up-regulation of M2 and P2X3 receptor transcripts in the mucosa and detrusor smooth muscle [31]. As we have previously shown, in various bladder pathologies, there is an increased role of the M2 subtype in mediating contraction [32]. However, our subtype-selective antagonist data support the role of the M3 receptor predominantly mediating the contraction. Also, we have previously shown that M3 transcript density is not correlated with protein levels across various rat bladder pathologies [33].",

This may suggest that mucosal M2 receptors participate in the bethanechol-induced contraction of these strips. Urothelial M2 receptors have been shown to mediate the release of ATP and PGE2 and both these compounds can stimulate ACh release from the urothelium [33]. The urothelial released ACh may act on muscarinic receptors and the urothelial released ATP may act on purinergic receptors to enhance contraction. Additional ATP and ACh released in response to bethanechol activation of mucosal M2 receptors would tend to reduce the darifenacin-induced shift in the bethanechol dose response curve, but would not reduce the methoctramine-induced shift. Because darifenacin potency is increased to a similar degree upon removal of the mucosa in both CIE and control bladder strips, CIE may not alter this urothelial modulatory mechanism.",

This may result from up-regulation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor smooth muscle of CIE mice, which is further supported by an increase in bethanechol potency in CIE bladder, as well as an increase in the bethanechol-induced maximum contractions (% KCl in denuded CIE vs control). This might be similar to the phenomenon of muscarinic supersensitivity following outlet obstruction [34]. Accumulation of lesions in the CNS as a result of CIE in mice, or MS in humans, will eventually disrupt or alter the complex neuronal control over micturition. This CIE mouse model shows demyelination primarily in the CNS; no demyelination in peripheral nerves was observed in the bladder wall. Yet, a distinct phenotype of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is observed, characterized by an increased number of non-voiding contractions and shortened inter-micturition interval. These symptoms are similar to those observed in upper spinal cord injuries, which suggests that the interruptions caused by MS-induced lesions result in decreased central control, resembling spinal cord injury. These cystometry findings are thought to be a function of increased afferent activity, suggesting a loss of descending inhibition from the pontine micturition center. Our data suggests there are changes in the motor (efferent) innervation as well, and that the mucosa plays a significant role in modulation of efferent signals. Previous studies have shown a tight link between the urothelium and nervous system [18], and a number of alterations in urothelial cells under pathological conditions. While our data supports this idea, further studies are required to definitively conclude which cell type(s) are altered in these mice, and to examine changes to bladder afferents.",
