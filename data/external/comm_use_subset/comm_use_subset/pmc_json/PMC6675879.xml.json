            "text": "Simarteriviruses comprise a rapidly expanding subfamily of undercharacterized arteriviruses now known to infect a wide range of nonhuman primates. The most notorious simarteriviruses, Pebjah virus (PBJV), simian hemorrhagic encephalitis virus (SHEV), and SHFV, repeatedly caused highly lethal hemorrhagic fever epizootics among captive macaques in the United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union throughout the 1960s to 1990s (reviewed in reference 8), but their natural host reservoirs are unknown. In contrast, other simarteriviruses found in nature, specifically, those in subclinically infected African nonhuman primates, have not been implicated in epizootics. These viruses include De Brazza\u2019s monkey virus 1 (DeBMV-1) in De Brazza\u2019s monkeys (Cercopithecus neglectus), Drakensberg Mountain vervet virus (DMVV-1) in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) (6), Kafue kinda-chacma baboon virus (KKCBV) in Kinda baboons (Papio kindae), Kibale red colobus viruses 1 and 2 (KRCV-1 and KRCV-2) in Ugandan red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) (9), Kibale red-tailed guenon viruses 1 and 2 (KRTGV-1/2) in red-tailed monkeys (Cercopithecus ascanius) (10), Mikumi yellow baboon virus 1 (MYBV-1) in yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) (11), southwest baboon virus 1 (SWBV-1) in olive baboons (Papio anubis) (11), and Zambian malbrouck virus 1 (ZMbV-1) in malbrouck monkeys (Chlorocebus cynosuros) (6). In experimental settings, KRCV-1 can cause mild disease in crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (12), whereas SWBV-1 infects but does not appear to cause disease in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) (13). Since wild nonhuman primates are historically important sources/reservoirs of human pathogens and because of their broad and diverse distribution among African monkeys, there is concern that some simian arteriviruses may be preemergent zoonotic pathogens (14). Hence, increased molecular characterization of simarteriviruses is becoming a priority in arterivirology.",

These include noncanonical translation mechanisms, such as programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) and alternative initiation, and in addition, the expression of polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved by viral or host proteases. Viruses may also produce subgenomic mRNAs that are functionally monocistronic. Arteriviruses use several of these strategies to coordinate their complex replication cycles (15, 16).",

            "text": "Arterivirus genomes vary in length between 12.5 and 15.5 kb and contain 10 to 15 known ORFs. All but two are located toward the 3\u2032 end of the genome and encode viral structural proteins that are translated from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (17). ORF1a and ORF1b, at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, comprise some three-quarters of the coding capacity and encode replicase-associated proteins. Translation of the genomic RNA yields the ORF1a polyprotein and, in addition, an ORF1ab fusion polyprotein following \u22121 PRF at the ORF1a/ORF1b junction (18, 19). The two polyproteins are processed into individual functional nonstructural proteins (nsps) by ORF1a-encoded protease domains. In PRRSV, these comprise two papain-like proteases, PLP1\u03b1 and PLP1\u03b2, located in nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, respectively, a papain-like protease (PLP2) domain situated in the N terminus of nsp2, and a serine protease domain residing in nsp4. The rapid release of nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp2 from the N terminus of the polyprotein is mediated by autocatalytic cleavage with PLP1\u03b1 (between nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 [nsp1\u03b1/1\u03b2]), PLP1\u03b2 (nsp1\u03b2/2), and PLP2 (nsp2/3) (20). In the SHFV nsp1 region, three papain-like proteases (PLP\u03b1, PLP\u03b2, and PLP\u03b3) are present within nsp1 subunits nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp1\u03b3. Similar to the case for PRRSV, these nsp1 subunits are released from the N terminus of SHFV polyproteins by autocleavages (21). Nsp2, the largest replicase subunit of arteriviruses, is a multifunctional protein that plays important roles in viral replication and virus-host interaction (20, 22\u201330). In addition to cleavage of the nsp2/3 site, the PLP2 domain functions as a cofactor for the serine protease during proteolytic processing of the C-terminal region of pp1a and pp1ab (20, 31). The C terminus of nsp2 contains a highly conserved Cys-rich domain of unknown function and a multispanning transmembrane domain that plays a critical role in the formation of membranous structures (32).",

            "text": "PRRSV uses an unusual \u22122 PRF signal to direct efficient expression of an additional protein from the +1 reading frame overlapping the nsp2-encoding region. The \u22122 PRF generates a transframe (TF) fusion protein, nsp2TF. It consists of the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2, followed by a unique C-terminal domain that is encoded by a novel overlapping TF ORF (33). At the same frameshifting site, an immediate stop codon is generated by \u22121 PRF, which leads to the expression of a truncated nsp2, designated nsp2N (34). Remarkably, both cellular poly(rC) binding proteins (PCBPs) and viral nsp1\u03b2 are required for efficient \u22122/\u22121 PRF (35). Sequence analysis shows that the signals for \u22122/\u22121 PRF, including a slippery sequence and downstream C-rich RNA motif, are highly conserved in all arterivirus genomes except that of EAV (36). However, variations in slippery sequences have been identified in several newly identified simarteriviruses. In this study, we demonstrate that \u22122/\u22121 PRF identified in PRRSV is evolutionarily conserved in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses, with particular emphasis on simarteriviruses. This study provides additional insights into the biological characteristics of arteriviruses and advances our knowledge of noncanonical translation mechanisms in both virus infection and cellular systems.",

In addition, the PRRSV replicase subunit nsp1\u03b2 functions as a transactivator for both \u22122 and \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF); in particular, a highly conserved \u03b1-helix motif in nsp1\u03b2 is critical for PRF transactivation (34). In this study, comparative genomic sequence analysis of arteriviruses was performed to identify the key elements of \u22122/\u22121 PRF in viruses of all relevant species in the Arteriviridae family. The slippery sequence and C-rich motif of the PRF signal were identified in all simarteriviruses, although a few substitutions were observed for viruses of different species, including U_GUU_UUU (KRTGV, PBJV, and De Brazza\u2019s monkey arterivirus [DeMAV]), G_GUC_UCU (KRCV-1, KRCV-2, MYBV-1, and KKCBV), and U_UUC_UCU (free state vervet virus [FSVV], SHEV, and ZMbV-1) (Fig. 1A). These signals all allow anticodon-codon re-pairing in the A site following a \u22122 PRF, but as in PRRSV, the potential for re-pairing in the P site is more limited. Of note, these PRF RNA signals were found in all known arteriviruses except EAV. Additionally, the distance between slippery sequence and C-rich motif is 9 or 10 nucleotides (nt), except in WPDV, in which the closest C-rich sequence is at a distance of 19 nt.",

In line with our previous studies in PRRSV (37, 38), two arginine residues in this motif are conserved among most arteriviruses (Arg114 and Arg115 in SHFV). In APRAV-1, the second arginine is replaced with a leucine residue (Fig. 1B). The three-dimensional (3-D) structures of nsp1\u03b2 of arteriviruses, with the exceptions of WPDV and EAV, were predicted with the I-TASSER server and RaptorX server guided by the known crystal structure of PRRSV-2 (XH-GD strain) nsp1\u03b2 (Fig. 1C) (39\u201341). The highly conserved motif consistently forms an \u03b1-helix. The longer distance between slippery sequence and C-rich sequence in WPDV and its different nsp1\u03b2 protein conformation compared to those of other arteriviruses suggest that WPDV likely does not utilize frameshifting at this site. Taken together, these data suggest that \u22122/\u22121 PRF might be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the expression of additional viral proteins in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses.",

To test our hypothesis that \u22122/\u22121 PRF is utilized to translate nsp2TF and nsp2N proteins in simarteriviruses, we initially characterized nsp2-related proteins in SHFV-infected MARC-145 cells. For the detection of nsp2-related proteins, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (mAb 133-243 and mAb 134-260) against the PLP2 domain, which is shared by SHFV nsp2 and the predicted nsp2TF and nsp2N. A rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) against the unique epitope (RLDSTVVFEETTPL) at the C terminus of nsp2TF was also generated for specific identification of nsp2TF. The N terminus of SHFV nsp2 (Gly484/Gly485/Gly486; the residue positions are based on the SHFV pp1a sequence) was previously determined by mass spectrometry sequence analysis (21). We further predicted the C terminus of SHFV nsp2 based on the putative cleavage site between nsp2 and nsp3. As shown in Fig. 2A, the cleavage site of SHFV nsp2/3 was predicted to be between Gly1236 and Gly1237 (the residue positions based on SHFV pp1a sequence) by analysis of sequence alignment with the nsp2/3 cleavage site in PRRSVs (20). Thus, the SHFV nsp2 gene is predicted to be nucleotides 1649 to 3901 of the SHFV genome, and the predicted molecular mass of the protein is 81.2 kDa. If \u22122/\u22121 PRF occurs, nsp2TF is translated from SHFV genomic nucleotides 1649 to 2860 fused to nucleotides 2859 to 3536, which results in a product with a predicted molecular mass of 68.7 kDa, and nsp2N is translated from SHFV genomic nucleotides 1649 to 2860 fused to nucleotides 2860 to 3093, resulting in a product with a predicted molecular mass of 52 kDa (Fig. 2B).",

The top three largest proteins appear to be nsp2, nsp2TF, and nsp2N, although their masses are larger than those that were predicted\u2014a phenomenon that was previously reported for nsp2-related proteins of PRRSV (33). The rabbit polyclonal antibody specifically designed to detect SHFV nsp2TF recognized two protein bands in the Western blot analysis. The top band appeared to be a cellular protein, since this band was also detected in mock-infected cells, while the second large protein band was specific to nsp2TF (Fig. 2C, right), indicating that SHFV indeed expresses nsp2TF via \u22122 PRF. The fourth band, with a size of less than 50 kDa, is a C-terminally truncated isoform of nsp2, which may be generated by proteolytic cleavage by PLP2 or some other proteinase. The identity of this product needs to be further studied in the future. To confirm the identity of these nsp2-related proteins, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed with anti-PLP2 mAb 133-243 using cell lysate of SHFV-infected MARC-145 cells, whereas cell lysate of mock-infected MARC-145 cells was used as a negative control. As expected, four major bands were detected in the IP product using mAb 134-260 (Fig. 2D, left), and the second-largest protein band was also recognized by the nsp2TF-specific pAb (Fig. 2D, right).",

When HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing nsp2 and nsp1\u03b2, both PRF products, nsp2TF and nsp2N, were detected (Fig. 3A, lane marked \u201cnsp1\u03b2\u201d). These results indicate that SHFV nsp1\u03b2 is critical for the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. To further identify the key residues in SHFV nsp1\u03b2, amino acids Gly109, Lys110, Tyr111, Arg114, and Arg115 in the conserved motif (Fig. 1A) were targeted for mutagenesis with alanine replacement. Consistent with our previous findings on PRRSV (34, 38), mutation of R to A at position 114 (R114A) completely abolished the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N, whereas the G109A and K110A mutations had no obvious effects on the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. The R115A mutant stimulated lower expression levels of nsp2TF and nsp2N, which may be due to the lower expression level of this nsp1\u03b2 mutant. The Y111A mutant was also unable to stimulate the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N, indicating that Tyr111 is another key residue for nsp1\u03b2\u2019s function in transactivation of \u22122/\u22121 PRF (Fig. 3A). This result was further confirmed with PRRSV: nsp2TF and nsp2N were not detectable in HEK-293T cells expressing PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 mutants that contained the corresponding alanine substitution at Y125 (PRRSV-2) or Y131 (PRRSV-1) (Fig. 3B). Similar to the R115A mutant, a lower expression level was observed for the SHFV Y111A mutant (Fig. 3A). However, this lower expression should not be the direct reason leading to the loss of expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N, since the Y111A mutant, with an expression level similar to that of wild-type (WT) nsp1\u03b2 in vY111A-infected cells, was unable to stimulate the expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N (see Fig. 5).",

A dual luciferase reporter plasmid, pDluc-SHFV/WT, was generated using the approach that we described previously (34), in which 79 nt containing the SHFV PRF signal was inserted in the plasmid between its Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and firefly luciferase (Fluc) ORFs. In this construct, Fluc was encoded in the \u22122 frame relative to the upstream Rluc ORF. Besides an in-frame Rluc product (stop), two frameshifting products (\u22122FS and \u22121FS) could be expressed through \u22122/\u22121 PRF (Fig. 4A). The predicted molecular masses of the stop, \u22121FS, and \u22122FS products are 40.4 kDa, 43.4 kDa, and 100.1 kDa, respectively. In HEK-293T cells cotransfected with the reporter plasmid and a plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1\u03b2, all three nsp2-related proteins were detected at the predicted sizes by a mAb against their shared N-terminal Rluc (Fig. 4B, lane marked \u201cnsp1\u03b2\u201d). Only the in-frame translation product (stop) was detected in cells without the expression of SHFV nsp1\u03b2 (Fig. 4B, lane marked \u201cEV\u201d in the pDluc-SHFV/WT-transfected cells). The ability of nsp1\u03b2 mutants to activate \u22122/\u22121 PRF was also tested using this reporter system. In cells expressing the SHFV nsp1\u03b2 Y111A or R114A mutants, \u22122FS and \u22121FS expression products were undetectable, indicating that Tyr111 and Arg114 are essential to nsp1\u03b2\u2019s ability to stimulate frameshifting (Fig. 4B). In cells expressing the SHFV nsp1\u03b2 R115A mutant, reduced expression of the \u22122FS product was observed, whereas the \u22121FS product was undetectable. Compared to the reduced expression levels of nsp2TF and nsp2N stimulated by the R115A mutant in Fig. 3A, SHFV nsp1\u03b2 R115A mutant in the luciferase reporter system may stimulate a much lower level of \u22121FS, which is under the detection limit of Western blot analysis.",

In this system, the predicted masses of stop, \u22121FS, and \u22122FS products are 40.4 kDa, 43.4 kDa, and 70.8 kDa. When in vitro translation was performed with only reporter mRNA from pDluc-SHFV/WT, the \u22122FS product was not detected and only a trace amount of \u22121FS was observed (Fig. 4C, lane marked \u201cDB\u201d [dilution buffer]). In contrast, with the addition of purified nsp1\u03b2, \u22121FS and \u22122FS were detected at the predicted molecular masses. Furthermore, within the range of 0\u223c1 \u03bcM of nsp1\u03b2, the expression levels of the \u22121 and \u22122 PRF products were observed to be dose dependent (Fig. 4C and D). When the concentration of nsp1\u03b2 was higher than 1 \u03bcM, both frameshifts reached their maximum efficiencies, which were 11.7% (\u22122 PRF) and 3.5% (\u22121 PRF) (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the purified nsp1\u03b2 R114A mutant was impaired in its ability to stimulate \u22122/\u22121 PRF, as demonstrated by the disappearance of the \u22122FS product, and reduction of \u22121FS product to the background level (Fig. 4E).",

To test whether some of these variant sequences could support \u22122/\u22121 PRF in the context of the SHFV 3\u2032 stimulatory sequence and SHFV nsp1\u03b2, plasmids pDluc-SHFV/SS1 and pDluc-SHFV/SS2 were created by introducing mutations at the SHFV slippery sequence in the dual luciferase reporter plasmid pDluc-SHFV/WT to mimic the PRF signals of distinct simarteriviruses (Fig. 6A). In the pDluc-SHFV/SS1 construct, the slippery sequence (G_GUU_UUU) was changed to G_GUC_UCU, whereas in the pDluc-SHFV/SS2 construct, the slippery sequence was changed to U_UUC_UCU (Fig. 6A).

In vitro translation using RRL was included as the control. As expected, in RRL, both \u22122FS and \u22121FS were stimulated by the presence of nsp1\u03b2 (Fig. 7A). In the WGE system, although there was some expression of \u22122FS and \u22121FS products in the absence of any exogenous protein, their levels were greatly stimulated only upon the addition of both nsp1\u03b2 and PCBP2. The presence of nsp1\u03b2 or PCBP2 alone showed no stimulatory effect on the translation of \u22122FS and \u22121FS products. (Note that, in contrast to RRL, WGE likely contains endogenous PCBPs that are divergent from those of mammalian cells and not active in the stimulation of PRF.) Interestingly, the frameshifting efficiencies for \u22121 PRF in WGE were much higher than those observed using RRL (Fig. 7B). With the addition of nsp1\u03b2 and PCBP2 in WGE, the efficiency of \u22122 PRF increased from 0.9% to 9.8%, whereas the efficiency of \u22121 PRF increased from 8% to 29%.

Five recombinant viruses with deficiencies in the expression of nsp2N and/or nsp2TF were passaged five times (P5 viruses) in MARC-145 cells, and the introduced mutations were verified for P5 viruses (data not shown). The P3 recombinant viruses were used to evaluate viral growth kinetics in vitro, and WT SHFV recovered by the reverse genetics was included as the control. Growth kinetics analysis showed that vY111A, vR114A, and vCC1 attenuated viral growth in MARC-145 cells, whereas vSS1 and vSS2 displayed growth kinetics similar to that of WT virus (Fig. 9A). Before 48 h postinfection (hpi), the virus titers of vCC1 were reduced by about 1 log compared to the titer of the WT virus. In contrast, the growth of the vY111A and vR114A mutants was more significantly reduced than vCC1, with virus titers decreasing 1.5 to 3 log throughout the time course of the study (Fig. 9A). The plaque assay results consistently showed that the vCC1, vY111A, and vR114A mutants developed smaller plaques than those caused by WT virus (Fig. 9B). All three mutants displaying attenuated growth have lost the ability to express nsp2TF and nsp2N (Fig. 5 and 6E). On the other hand, vSS1 and vSS2 express nsp2TF but not nsp2N and had growth kinetics more similar to that of WT virus. This finding suggests that nsp2TF plays a role in SHFV replication, whereas nsp2N appears not to be important for viral growth in MARC-145 cells. Nonetheless, the relatively mild attenuation of vCC1, which expresses neither nsp2TF nor nps2N, confirms that neither protein is essential for viral growth in cell culture, but they may be important for maintaining maximal virus fitness.",

            "text": "Comparative genomic analysis of 19 arteriviruses revealed that the key elements for \u22122/\u22121 PRF, including the slippery sequence and downstream C-rich RNA motif, are highly conserved in all known arteriviruses except EAV. Of note, the distance between the slippery sequence and downstream C-rich RNA motif is consistently 9 or 10 nt in all non-EAV arteriviruses, with the exception of that of WPDV, which has a stretch that is 9 nucleotides longer. WPDV is phylogenetically distant from other arteriviruses (47). It also lacks a long overlapping TF ORF (36); thus, like EAV, WPDV most likely does not utilize frameshifting in this region of the nsp2 gene. Our experimental data indicate that a \u22122/\u22121 PRF mechanism similar to that used by PRRSV is employed by simarteriviruses to express nsp2TF and/or nsp2N analogs. In addition, we also experimentally demonstrated that nsp1\u03b2 proteins of other arteriviruses (KRCV-1, PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2, and LDV, but not EAV) are able to stimulate ribosomal frameshifting on the SHFV \u22122/\u22121 PRF RNA signal. These results indicate that \u22122/\u22121 PRF is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism used by most arteriviruses for the expression of additional viral proteins. Furthermore, in line with our previous study on PRRSV, at least nsp2TF plays an important role in SHFV replication. Previous studies suggest that the N-terminal PLP2 domain shared by nsp2-related proteins of arteriviruses (PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2, LDV, and SHFV) suppresses the host type I IFN response through its deubiquitination activity (30). In comparison with nsp2, PRRSV-2 nsp2TF and nsp2N have a stronger inhibitory effect on host innate immune responses (45). Therefore, we suspect that SHFV nsp2TF and nsp2N may also play important roles in SHFV infection and virus-host interaction.",

In the case of PRRSV, we proposed that tandem slippage of ribosome-bound tRNAs on G_GUU_UUU allows complete A site re-pairing in both \u22121 and \u22122 frames (tRNA anticodon-mRNA codon pairing in 0 frame is 3\u2032-AAG-5\u2032:5\u2032-UUU-3\u2032; single tRNAPhe isoacceptor AAG). In contrast, however, tandem slippage of ribosome-bound tRNAs on G_GUC_UCU and U_UUC_UCU does not allow A site re-pairing in the \u22121 frame. Consistently, our results showed that the SHFV SS1 and SS2 mutants that mimic these slippery sequence variants only permit \u22122 PRF. Thus, those simarteriviruses carrying the slippery sequence of G_GUC_UCU or U_UUC_UCU are unlikely to be able to express nsp2N. As indicated above, the SHFV nsp2N is predicted to be an innate immune antagonist. It will be interesting to compare the pathogenicity of this group of simarteriviruses (lack of nsp2N expression) with that of SHFV (expression of nsp2N).",

Comparative sequence analysis of nsp1\u03b2 of 19 arteriviruses shows that the highly conserved \u03b1-helix motif is present in all of them except EAV and WPDV. In our study, we observed that SHFV nsp1\u03b2 stimulates \u22122/\u22121 PRF to express nsp2TF and nsp2N, and an alanine substitution at Arg114 completely impairs this process. Consistently, nsp1\u03b2 of KRCV-1, a newly isolated simarterivirus, is also capable of stimulating \u22122 PRF. Based on sequence alignment, Arg114 in SHFV nsp1\u03b2 is the residue corresponding to Arg128 in PRRSV-2 and Arg134 in PRRSV-1, and this arginine is universally conserved among all arteriviruses except EAV and WPDV. Besides this arginine, Tyr111 in SHFV is also highly conserved among all arteriviruses except EAV and WPDV. Of note, alanine substitutions introduced at this residue in SHFV and at analogous residues in PRRSV-1 (Tyr131) and PRRSV-2 (Tyr125) also impair nsp1\u03b2\u2019s ability to stimulate \u22122/\u22121 PRF of both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2. Remarkably, nsp1\u03b2s from PRRSV-1, PRRSV-2, KRCV-1, and LDV are capable of stimulating ribosomal frameshifting on the SHFV \u22122/\u22121 PRF signal. The amino acid sequence identities of nsp1\u03b2s among these arteriviruses range from 21.4% to 57.7%. However, in silico structure prediction shows that, with the exception of EAV nsp1 and WPDV nsp1\u03b2, all arteriviral nsp1\u03b2s share a similar 3-D structure, and the conserved \u03b1-helix motif is also found in these predicted structures. These data suggest that the nsp1\u03b2 protein structure, especially the \u03b1-helix region, is essential for its PRF transactivation function.",

Our recent study explored the function of PCBPs in enhancing \u22122/\u22121 PRF, together with viral protein nsp1\u03b2 (35). We also observed that the enhancement of \u22122/\u22121 PRF in SHFV was dependent on the addition of both viral nsp1\u03b2 and PCBP2 in WGE (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, the frameshifting efficiencies for \u22121 PRF in WGE were much higher than those observed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). In our previous study on the PRRSV frameshift signal (35), we found efficient \u22122 PRF in RRL upon the addition of PRRSV nsp1\u03b2 only. Additional supplementation with PCBP2 maintained \u22122 PRF but also led to an increase in \u22121 PRF. We reasoned that RRL may already contain endogenous PCBPs, with a balance of paralogs that favored \u22122 PRF over \u22121 PRF. Turning to WGE translations, we found that supplementation with PCBP2 led preferentially to \u22121 PRF, whereas supplementation with PCPB1 led preferentially to \u22122 PRF. This finding suggests that PCBP1 is the abundant form in RRL. Knockdown of either PCBP1 or PCBP2 in mammalian cells using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) produced consistent results. In the current SHFV study, supplementation with PCBP2 could particularly promote \u22121 PRF in WGE due to the absence of competing endogenous mammalian PCBP1 (compare Fig. 7B with Fig. 4D). As we expected, the interaction between PCBP1/2 and nsp1\u03b2 was detected by coimmunoprecipitation in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 8A and C). In SHFV-infected MARC-145 cells, SHFV nsp1\u03b2 was also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PCBP2 (Fig. 8B). These data suggest that PCBPs are required for efficient \u22122/\u22121 PRF in arteriviruses, and the interaction between nsp1\u03b2 and PCBPs may be also required for the mechanism.",

Specific anti-nsp1\u03b2 and anti-nsp2 mAbs were obtained by screening with an immunofluorescence assay. mAbs 133-243 and 134-260 against the SHFV nsp2 N-terminal PLP2 domain and mAb 76-69 against SHFV nsp1\u03b2 were used in this study. mAbs 36-19 and 140-68 were used for specifically recognizing nsp2 of PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, respectively (34). A polyclonal antibody (pAb) against the SHFV nsp2TF C-terminal peptide (RLDSTVVFEETTPLLDQVPVC; nsp2TFC) was produced in rabbits by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The following antibodies from commercial resources were also used in this study: anti-HA tag mAb 16B12 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-FLAG tag mAb M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-human PCBP2 mAb 23-G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), anti-human PCBP1 rabbit pAb (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and anti-Renilla luciferase mAb clone 1D5.2 (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). mAb 12A4 against EAV nsp1 (53) was generously provided by Udeni Balasuriya at Louisiana State University.",

A 79-nt sequence (WT) containing the SHFV putative slippery sequence and downstream C-rich motif assumed to be necessary for \u22122/\u22121 PRF was inserted between Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and firefly luciferase (Fluc; in the \u22122 frame relative to Rluc) ORFs. Constructs SS1 and SS2 contain substitutions (red) at the slippery sequence to mimic natural PRF signal variations identified in simarteriviruses other than SHFV. The CC1 construct contains substitutions (red) to disrupt the C-rich motif, while the in-frame control (IFC) construct was generated by inserting two Us after the slippery sequence. (B) Effect of mutations in the slippery sequence (SS1 and SS2) or C-rich motif (CC1) on SHFV \u22122/\u22121 PRF in the pDluc reporter system. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with pDluc-SHFV/WT or mutants thereof and a plasmid expressing SHFV nsp1\u03b2; empty vector (EV) was used as a control.
