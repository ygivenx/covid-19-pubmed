These exercises have explored a wide range of topics from foodborne toxoplasmosis outbreaks\n[3], chemical disasters\n[4], acute blood shortages\n[5], bioterrorism\n[6], and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\n[7]. Exercises have been designed to assess and improve a variety of capabilities such as regional disaster preparedness among rural hospitals\n[8], knowledge and confidence of legal authorities\n[9], resource allocation\n[10] and risk communications\n[11]. A large number of these exercises have been focused on the spread of infectious diseases especially the threat of pandemic influenza because the common challenges pandemic influenza shares with other types of public health emergencies\n[12-16].",

A considerable number of these types of exercises in the United States have been published in the academic literature but few findings from exercises that have taken place outside the United States have been published. Some researchers in the United States have tried to solve this gap by publishing the findings of \u201cvirtual\u201d internet-based, long distance exercises conducted remotely with international partners\n[17,18]. Even less is known from direct experiences with in-country exercises or exercises that span multiple countries in a given region. The results of these types of exercises may be reported directly to exercise participants but often don\u2019t make it to the scientific literature. If the results from exercises are published in any systematic way, they often get published in in-house publications for domestic audiences rather than scientific journals with a more global reach. The incentives, financial or otherwise, for researchers to turn these in-house publications into scientific papers are limited. This is a major loss to our knowledge base because countries around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of transnational efforts to complement national efforts to detect and respond to public health threats quickly and effectively\n[19-23]. Exercises provide these countries with a vehicle to collaborate and test their ability to respond to these transnational threats. Exercises also provide these countries with an avenue to build relationships and trust among colleagues across sectors and across borders\n[24].",

Countries in three different geographic regions participated: Southeast Asia (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam), the Middle East (Israel, Jordan and Palestine) and East Africa (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda). Countries that participated in the exercises were included because they were all part of sub-regional disease surveillance networks established in part through funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Some countries not included in these networks were invited to observe the exercises. Countries ranged in their past experience with preparedness exercises with some countries having extensive past exercise experience (such as Israel, Vietnam, China and Thailand) and other countries having minimal past exercise experience (such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Uganda). Exercises were developed and conducted by exercise planning teams that included external exercise development experts from the RAND Corporation as well as senior health leaders from each of the respective localities and/or countries represented in the exercise. There were three different levels of exercises: sub-national (e.g., one or more provincial areas), national (e.g., one country) and sub-regional (e.g., multiple countries from one geographic region).",

Each exercise focused on three to six different broad topic areas such as surveillance and information sharing, disease control, and communications that were identified in previous exercises as important\n[2,12]. Because Thailand had considerable previous experience with exercises, it designed and conducted its sub-national exercise with limited involvement from representatives at RAND. Exercise discussions focused on one topic area at a time each lasting from 30 to 90 minutes. Participants of exercises were selected by the exercise planning team and differed from exercise to exercise, but all exercises included representatives from the health sector of the locality and/or country represented. They also included senior leaders from at least one other non-health sector. In addition to participants, exercises also had \u201cobservers\u201d who were invited to watch the exercise but did not directly engage in exercise discussions. All exercises were led by one or two exercise \u201cfacilitators\u201d who directed the exercise discussion and probed participants for more information. In general, exercise facilitators can represent a range of disciplines from media professionals to health professionals. In these exercises the facilitators were all health officials or health researchers who were trained in the facilitation of exercises and who had extensive experience facilitating past exercises.",

In January 2013, health leaders who were involved in the planning of the exercises from a subset of countries participated in brief semi-structured face-to-face interviews to discuss how their country followed up with the exercises and the current state of their exercise program.

Participants also consistently rated the exercises highly for helping them to understand the roles and responsibilities of organizations and agencies responding to an influenza pandemic (91-94% rating the exercise as good or excellent in this area) with one exception (China sub-regional exercise 76% rated the exercise as good or excellent in this area). Participants differed on what they felt about the quality of the information shared in the exercises (67%-93% rated the information as good or excellent). Participants rated the exercises lowest on their ability to identify key gaps in performance (50%-73% agreeing or strongly agreeing the exercises identified important key gaps). There are a variety of factors that could explain this result. First, tabletop exercises are discussion based and do not directly test operational capabilities. This may limit the ability of tabletop exercises to concretely identify key operational gaps. Second, tabletop exercises are subjective and participants may disagree about what constitutes a key gap. Third, the limited time frame to conduct tabletop exercises and the limited number of topics that can be discussed in that time frame may inhibit the ability of these exercises to identify a significant number of key gaps. A fourth possibility is that cultural sensitivities in some of these countries may have limited participants\u2019 comfort in identifying gaps in their government\u2019s preparedness system. The exercises were most successful at helping participants gain knowledge that they planned to use to improve the preparedness of their organization (82%-100% agreeing or strongly agreeing that they would use what they learned from the exercise).",

Participants also left the exercises with specific ideas about the most important follow-up actions that they should take in the near future. Specifically, participants identified better planning, improved planning coordination across sectors and countries and better training of health workers and response personnel. Finally participants provided feedback on the use of tabletop exercises for pandemic influenza preparedness. No participants stated that they felt the exercises involved too many sectors. In fact, many participants reported that they felt more sectors should be involved and that exercises should also involve more private sector partners and more partners from NGOs. Participants also felt that more could be done in the exercises to ground theoretical responses with more practical responses.",

However, one country that had no prior exercise experience organized and carried out numerous sub-national exercises on their own after participating in the national and sub-regional exercise.

            "text": "These experiences suggest that exercises can be a valuable, low-burden tool to improve emergency preparedness and response in countries around the world. They also demonstrate that countries can work together to develop and conduct successful exercises designed to improve regional preparedness to public health threats. Regular participation in exercises is associated with improved overall response to public health threats\n[26]. Countries that participated in sub-regional exercises together reported that these exercises improved their response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic\n[24,27]. But exercises are not perfect. Research has called into question the ability of exercises to adequately expose operational and logistical gaps\n[28]. This is consistent with our finding that exercise participants rated the exercises lowest for identifying key gaps. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on what makes exercises effective tools to assess public health preparedness and how the outputs of exercises such as AARs can be used to support and improve public health preparedness efforts\n[29]. Thus, the development of standardized evaluation methods for exercises may be an additional tool to help focus the actions to be taken as a result of the exercise and to improve future exercises. Despite these flaws, exercises show great promise as tools to build relationships, assess performance and improve collaborative planning for public health threats across multiple sectors and multiple countries over time.",
