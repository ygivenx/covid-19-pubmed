            "text": "Inflammation is a complex set of interactions among soluble factors and cells that can arise in any tissue in response to infection and tissue damage induced by ischemic, traumatic, or autoimmune injury. The process normally leads to recovery and healing. However, inflammation loses its repairing function and can enhance tissue damage if this process is not properly controlled [1]. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils are the most abundant class of white blood cells, and typically the first type of leukocyte recruited to sites of inflammation. It is well understood that neutrophils play an important role in the battle against invading pathogens by delivery of antimicrobial molecules and reactive oxygen intermediates [2]. Inflammation is also recognized as a major contributor to diverse acute and chronic central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving cells from both peripheral immune system and CNS and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. For chronic neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, neuroinflammation mostly involves activation of the innate immune responses in the brain [3,4]. On the other hand, invasion of peripheral immune cells and interactions between innate and systemic immune cells occurs in acute brain damages as stroke, infection, and traumatic brain injury. Studies have shown the existence of neutrophils in the CNS under these pathological conditions [5-9]. Given the abundance of neutrophils in the CNS during neuroinflammation and the non-specificity of the neutrophil-derived cytotoxic compounds, it is speculated that neutrophils' anti-infectious action in host defense can also mediate tissue damages. From an evolutionary view, the homeostasis of neutrophils must be highly regulated. Indeed, the inflammation response is a complex process and includes production of host-derived anti-inflammatory mediators and apoptosis of neutrophils [10]. In addition, function of the infiltrated neutrophil might be regulated by the local innate immune cells. Consistently, it has been demonstrated that microglia could interact and engulf invading neutrophils, hence providing protection for the CNS [11].",

            "text": "Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell population in the CNS and play a critical role for the maintenance of CNS homeostasis. Evidence is emerging that astrocytes participate in the local innate immune response triggered by a variety of insults [12]. Astrocytes modulate nitric oxide production by microglia through secretion of serine and glycine [13]. Under inflammatory conditions, intercellular communication in the astroglial network may be regulated by activated microglia. Microglia-derived Prostaglandin D2 enhances GFAP production and astrogliosis [14]. Studies have also demonstrated that astrocytes could regulate peripheral immune cells that infiltrated into the CNS under pathological conditions. In response to T cell attack, astrocytes polarize towards the contacting T cells in vivo and in vitro [15], and present antigens to T cells [16]. Astrocytes may suppress antigen-dependent T cell proliferation as well as cytokine production [17,18]. Surprisingly, interactions between astrocytes and neutrophils, the most abundant cell types in the CNS and in the peripheral immune system, respectively, has not been well characterized. In the present study, we focused on the interaction of astrocytes and neutrophils to investigate the impact of astrocytes on different functions of neutrophils using ex vivo cultured mouse primary astrocytes and bone marrow-derived neutrophils.",

After 1 hour incubation, non-adherent neutrophils were washed off and CFSE intensity was determined. Significantly higher CFSE intensity was detected in all co-culture groups compared with both resting neutrophils alone and primed neutrophils alone cultures. The highest CFSE intensity was observed in co-cultures of primed astrocytes with primed neutrophils (Figure 2A left). Time course analysis showed a time-dependent increase of CFSE intensity in the co-cultures, suggesting neutrophils might bind to astrocytes through ligand-receptor engagement in a time-dependent manner (Figure 2A right). For immunocytochemistry, astrocytes were fixed and stained with Alexa Fluo594 conjugated GFAP antibody. We observed that neutrophils bind to not only astrocytes but also plastic surface, and both binding were enhanced by astrocytes activation (Figure 2B). To further determine the specific cell-cell binding, APC-conjugated-Gr1-antibody-labeled neutrophils were incubated with CFSE-labeled primary astrocytes in floating culture, and the neutrophils-astrocytes clusters were detected by FACS analysis. It demonstrated that neutrophils bind to astrocytes in a time-dependent manner (Figure 2C). Consistently, incubation of neutrophils with poly I:C-activated astrocytes significantly enhanced the direct binding of neutrophils and astrocytes (Figure 2C &2D). We found that binding ability between astrocytes and neutrophils was correlated to the size of astrocytes. The larger the astrocytes, the more neutrophils binding were observed (Figure 2E).",

We found that resting neutrophils terminate their life through apoptosis, not necrosis, as very few PI-positive cells were seen in resting neutrophil group. In LPS-primed neutrophils, Annexin V+/PI- cells, which were early apoptotic cells, decreased by ~1/3 compared with resting cells.

Then, neutrophils were stained with Annexin V/PI and quantified with FACS. A similar amount of early apoptotic cells was detected in resting neutrophils. The apoptosis of neutrophils was decreased by a half upon LPS stimulation. On the other hand, a moderate increase of necrosis (PI+) induced by LPS stimulation was detected. Consistently, a robust inhibition of apoptosis in neutrophils was identified when neutrophils were co-culture with primary astrocytes in the same compartment. Transwell culture of neutrophils with astrocytes without direct contact demonstrated an inhibitory action on neutrophils apoptosis and a dramatic enhancement on neutrophils necrosis (Figure 3B &3D). We concluded that astrocytes could significantly enhance neutrophils survival by inhibiting both apoptosis and necrosis. The inhibitory action of astrocytes on neutrophils apoptosis was independent of cell-cell binding, while, the inhibition of necrosis was cell-cell binding-dependent. In addition, astrocytes could induce neutrophils necrosis potentially through releasing soluble factors, which could be overcome by cell-cell contact between astrocytes and neutrophils.",

LPS significantly increased MPO release compared to resting neutrophils cultures. Astrocytes profoundly reduced MPO production from both resting and activated neutrophils, suggesting that astrocytes could prevent degranulation of primary granules in neutrophils (Figure 6A). Furthermore, the transwell experiment demonstrated that the inhibitory action of astrocytes on neutrophils degranulation was mediated by astrocyte-derived soluble factors independent of cell-cell contact as the attenuation of MPO releasing could be observed when astrocytes and neutrophils were cultured in separate compartments (Figure 6B).

Akt level was increased in a time-dependent manner, while, phosphorylation of Akt peaked at 30 min and maintain at a high level for at least 8 hours (Figure 8A). For Erk1/2 MAPK pathway, astrocytes increased phosphorylated Erk1/2 levels while decreased total Erk1/2 expression in neutrophils. Further, a time-dependent up-regulation of Erk1/2 phosphorylation in neutrophils induced by astrocytes were seen (Figure 8A). P38 mediates LPS-induced activation of neutrophils. Consistently, our data showed that LPS induced phosphorylation of p38 over time. Co-culture with astrocytes also increased phosphorylated p38 level in neutrophils, suggesting the involvement of p38 MAPK pathway in the regulatory action of astrocytes on neutrophils (Figure 8B left). Moreover, the augmentation of phosphorylated p38 in neutrophils by astrocytes lasted up to 24 hours (Figure 8B right and 8C).

For acute brain damage such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and infection et al., inflammation comprises infiltration of neutrophils and other peripheral immune cell types into the injured brain parenchyma, activation of astrocytes and microglias, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory mediators. Under these conditions, neutrophils are generally the first leukocyte subtype recruited to the brain. There they face the sophisticated CNS cellular network of which astrocytes are a critical component. Within the CNS, astrocytes outnumber neurons by approximately ten-fold and have critical roles in CNS homeostasis [20]. It is also generally accepted that astrocytes are involved in the neuroinflammatory process by secreting various cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [21-23]. In addition, astrocytes are able to modulate functions of other cell types such as microglia and monocytes through direct cell-cell interaction [24]. Astrocytes interact with infiltrated T cells to induce development of regulator T cells so as to suppress effector T cell functions during autoimmune encephalitis [25]. Astrocytes can down regulate monocytic/microglial activation [26]. Our current study provides the first evidence that astrocytes can differentially regulate neutrophil functions, supporting the idea that astrocytes participate in neuroinflammatory responses triggered by a variety of insults [12].",

Importantly, neutrophil apoptosis is accompanied by a general decrease in cell function and proinflammatory capacity, which is the key to non-inflammatory removal of effect cells [10]. In the apoptosis assay, both resting and primed astrocytes were able to inhibit neutrophil apoptosis, indicating that astrocytes possess intrinsic and activation-independent ability to enhance neutrophil survival. Although the adhesion assay showed that more neutrophils bind to astrocytes when they were both primed, co-culture of primed neutrophils with primed astrocytes failed to elicit stronger inhibition of apoptosis compared to co-culture of resting neutrophils with resting astrocytes, suggesting that the molecular engagement responsible for neutrophil-astrocyte adhesion may not play an important role in the inhibitory action of astrocytes on neutrophil apoptosis. Our transwell assay demonstrated that neutrophil apoptosis was reduced, while necrosis was dramatically increased by astrocytes. We conclude that astrocytes might regulate neutrophil survival in two distinct ways: soluble factor(s) may induce neutrophil necrosis while cellular contact inhibits both necrosis and apoptosis. Thus the fate of neutrophils might depend on their distance from astrocytes. Considering the dispersed distribution of a large number of astrocytes and their numerous processes in the CNS, it is plausible that neutrophils may live longer with the aid of astrocytes. The inhibition of neutrophil necrosis might be protective for the CNS tissue as necrotic neutrophils release their cargo, including MMPs; serine proteases; elastase; and myeloperoxidase, all of which are tissue-damaging.",

Given the anti-apoptotic action of astrocytes on neutrophils, we predicted that astrocytes would inhibit phagocytotic actions of neutrophils. To our surprise, our study demonstrated that phagocytosis of neutrophils was enhanced by astrocytes through cell-cell contact-independent mechanisms. The precise mechanisms underlying this enhancing action of astrocytes on neutrophil survival and phagocytosis, and the significance of this action, are not clear. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells that are able to phagocytose and destroy infectious agents. Therefore, we speculate that the enhancing action of astrocytes on the survival and phagocytosis of neutrophils could provide potential protection against the increased risk of microbial infection due to a compromised BBB induced by stroke or traumatic brain injury. In addition, the augmentary action of astrocytes on neutrophils could limit replication of viruses or bacteria under infectious condition [28]. Neutrophils produce numerous cytokines following phagocytosis, which contribute to the inflammatory response [10]. Consistent with the augmenting action of astrocytes on neutrophil phagocytosis, our study also demonstrates that astrocytes can enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in neutrophils.",

It is speculated that neutrophils might utilize the same mechanisms in the CNS as in the periphery. The production of bacteriocidal products by neutrophils, including proteases, phospholipase, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide, could induce further damage to tissue that survives the initial insult. Neutrophil contact and protease production has been involved in neuron death in hippocampal primary cultures, indicating that neurotoxic agents are contained mainly in neutrophil azurophilic granules [30]. Reactive oxygen intermediates and hypohalous acid interact with an unlimited number of macromolecules, while degranulation causes the release of multiple proteases to liquefy tissue [2]. In our assay, we utilized H2DCFDA to detect intracellular ROS rather than extracellular ROS because phagocyte oxidase complex-derived ROS production by astrocytes might interfere with the quantity of neutrophil-derived extracellular ROS [31]. We found ROS production in neutrophils was reduced by astrocytes, indicating an inhibitory action of astrocytes on neutrophil respiratory bursts. This inhibition of ROS production could lessen brain damage, therefore benefitting brain recovery. Furthermore, ROS actively participates in cell signaling to influence phagocytosis, apoptosis and gene expression [32,33], indicating that astrocyte-induced ROS reduction might intertwine with signal transduction pathways to regulate neutrophil behaviors. Our results further reveal that the inhibitory effect of astrocytes on neutrophil ROS production is cell-cell contact dependent, suggesting an engagement of cell surface molecules between neutrophils and astrocytes. The inhibitory action of astrocytes on MPO release from neutrophils indicates that astrocytes may block discharge of azurophilic granules from neutrophils. Given the neurotoxic effects of neutrophils, it is speculated that astrocytes could provide protection against excessive tissue damage induced by the infiltrated neutrophils in the CNS.",

The serine/threonine kinase Akt is one important signal transduction pathway that mediates the delay of neutrophil apoptosis caused by inflammatory mediators [35]. Activation of p38 is required for TNF-\u03b1-induced FMLP-mediated signaling, while, ERK activation is necessary but not sufficient for neutrophil homotypic aggregation [34]. Not surprisingly, the multifaceted actions of astrocytes on neutrophil functions are associated with multiple signaling pathways. Our study demonstrates that both PI3-K and MAPK pathways in neutrophils are activated when they are co-cultured with astrocytes.

            "text": "In summary, the current study reveals sophisticated regulatory actions of astrocytes on neutrophils. Astrocytes are able to interact with neutrophils directly and indirectly, and the interaction can be enhanced by activation. Our study suggests that astrocytes can regulate neutrophil functions differently depending on direct or indirectly interaction between the two cell types. Upon direct cell-cell contact, astrocytes attenuate neutrophil apoptosis, respiratory bust, and degranulation, while, enhancing neutrophil phagocytotic capability and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. For indirect interactions with neutrophils, astrocytes attenuate apoptosis and enhance necrosis in neutrophils, augment neutrophil phagocytosis and respiratory burst, and inhibit neutrophil degranulation. We speculate that, in vivo, proximal astrocytes regulate neutrophils through cellular contact, while distal astrocytes influence neutrophils via soluble mediators. The diversified actions of astrocytes on neutrophils could provide protection against potential microbial infection given compromised BBB integrity, and prevent excessive damage caused by neutrophil infiltration. Our results warrant further in vivo studies to determine the impact of astrocyte-neutrophil interactions in neuropathological conditions. The complex actions of astrocytes on neutrophils could provide further insight to harness the inflammatory response to promote CNS repair.",
