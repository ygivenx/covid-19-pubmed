We found that some cytokines rapidly increased to their highest levels, whereas others took much longer to do so (Table 3). For example, plasma IP-10, IL-8, and MCP-1 in RDPs reached peak value at 30 days post infection, whereas IL-6, GM-CSF, and VEGF were delayed after 60 days post infection in RDPs. More interestingly, RDPs had much earlier and stronger cytokine storms in acute stage, compared with SDPs (49.6 days vs. 74.9 days, respectively; 6.7-fold vs. 3.7-fold change, respectively). For example, a 13.7-fold increase in IFN-\u03b3 was seen in RDP at day 30 after infection, but only a 2.5-fold increase in SDP at day 81 after infection. 19 of 26 cytokines in RDPs had an approximate time of initial elevation to peak value between 30 and 60 days post-infection, whereas only 3 of 26 cytokines in SDPs did so. Additionally, the hierarchy of cytokine induction differed between SDP and RDP groups. RDPs had significantly and early increased IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, but a delayed IL-13 and VEGF compared with SDPs. Surprisingly, IL-13 in SDP reached peak value at day 33 after infection, compared to day 105 in RDP. Considering that cytokine storms are triggered by HIV, we further analyzed the dynamics of virus replication and its kinetic relationship with cytokine storms. To our surprise, as shown in Fig. 2, we found the drop of viral load from peak to set-point was followed by a decline of most of cytokines in RDPs, whereas cytokines increased in SDPs.",

Then we asked whether RDPs had higher levels of plasma cytokines than SDPs in chronic infection as in acute disease. As shown in Fig. 2, both RDPs and SDPs had high levels of plasma cytokines after viral set point, and had a second wave of cytokines storms during chronic stages. FGF-2, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-13, IL-15, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra and VEGF had increased more than 12-fold. 7 of 26 cytokines increased 7\u201312 fold, and 11 cytokines have less than 7-fold changes.

Furthermore, in RDPs, there were 146 (44.9%) statistically significant correlations between the levels of individual cytokines. In contrast, in SDPs, there were 241 (74.2%) such correlations (p < 0.001). Thus, the cytokine networks become more interlocked in SDPs than those in RDPs: 114 new correlations were established, and 19 correlations were lost. 97 pre-existing correlations increased in magnitude, 29 decreased, and 1 did not. For example, for IL-2, only correlations with IL-15, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were found in RDPs, while 11 new statistically significant correlations, including those with IL-4 and IL-10, were established for this cytokine in SDPs. In another example, a relatively weak correlation of IL-6 with IL-10 in RDPs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001) became a very strong one in SDPs (r = 0.993, p < 0.001).",

            "text": "The first finding in this study was that RDPs had rapidly increased cytokines in peripheral blood in very early after infection, whereas SDP had delayed and only mild increases of plasma cytokines. These data overwhelming suggested that increased cytokines in very early infection were related to immunopathogenesis and rapid disease progression, which is consistent with other reports and findings in HBV, HCV and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) infections56252627. Second, we found RDPs had a disparate cytokine profile compared with SDPs. Multiple cytokines in RDPs, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-1ra, IL-10, G-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-17, reached peak value in 4 to 5 weeks after infection, whereas only IP-10 and IL-13 in SPDs did so, and lack of TNF-\u03b1 in SDPs. Consistent with our results, another report had also shown elevations in IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 in acute HIV infection3. IFN-\u03b3 is secreted by NK cells, Th1 cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes during active infection. IFN-\u03b3 has broad effects on immune activation, proinflammatory responses, and immune modulation28. Interesting, we found IL-13 in SDP reached peak value at much earlier time than RDPs. An in vitro study had shown that IL-13 decreased TNF-\u03b1 secreting and modulated monocytes towards supporting Ag-specific cell medicated responses29. These data suggested that the rapid increased IL-13 in SDPs might play a role in augmenting Ag-specific cell medicated responses and be related to slow disease progression.",

The first rapid and transient elevations in TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-8, G-CSF, and IP-10 were at 2 weeks after detection of peak viral load and declined in parallel with the decrease of viral replication, which suggested that the virus directly or indirectly drives the production of cytokine. Rapid and more-sustained elevations in IL-1ra, MIP-1\u03b1, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-17 levels were followed by IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, IL-12, IL-15, IFN-\u03b12, MIP-1\u03b2, FGF-2 and GM-CSF at over 2 months post-infection, and accompanied by the recovery of CD4+ cells. A lately increased cytokine IL-6, VEGF and IL-13 were at around 3 months after infection. This complex change on the dynamic of cytokines in RDPs did not happen in SDPs, who had much delayed and milder changes in plasma cytokines. These data suggested that vigorous cytokines storm in RDPs very early after infection reflected the battle between virus replication and host immune response, and resulted in immunopathogenesis and rapid disease progression3031.",

The production of an immunosuppressive cytokine like IL-10 became a very strong correlation of IL-6 in slow progression group, compared with rapid progression group. This is consistent with reports from Dr. Andrea Lisco\u2019s group and others that have demonstrated that in the course of HIV infection various cytokines are up- or down-regulated in blood and semen, and are more interlocked than uninfected individuals10153233. Here we more precisely characterized the \u201crigidity\u201d of the network in slow and rapid progressors and found cytokines were more related in SDPs than in RDPs. We revealed that HIV-1 infection imposes a qualitatively new order on the cytokine network and its underlying cellular networks, which may contribute to immunodeficiency. Although the multiple functions of many cytokines are not completely understood and we do not know the exact functional meaning of correlations and whether they have direct effects on the immune response, our study shows that many positive correlations are built in the blood of HIV-1-infected individuals. A larger cohort study may reveal critical factors associated with the regulation of the cytokines network and indicate novel targets for therapy strategies. There were some limitations in this study, including the small number of patients, which introduces the possibility of bias that could lead to an underestimation of the true differences. Additionally, there were more individuals with syphilis in RDP than SDP, which may contribute to immune activation and lead to transient increases in HIV-1 RNA plasma levels and decreases in CD4+ cell counts, however, it had been shown that syphilis has no apparent long-term impact on HIV-1 progression34.",
