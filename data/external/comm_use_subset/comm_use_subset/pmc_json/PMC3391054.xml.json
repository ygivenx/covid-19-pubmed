I was especially thrilled that Lance was able to make introductory remarks this evening because he bridges two of the most important institutions in my professional life. Lance previously served on the Board of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, an extraordinary global health institution that I have been associated with for the last 12 years, and he recently began a new position with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Not only has the Gates Foundation generously supported our work on the human hookworm vaccine for the past decade, but in addition Gates, together with Sabin, has introduced me to some of my most important scientific mentors, including Drs. Philip K. Russell, Ciro de Quadros, Regina Rabinovich, and Jan Agosti. It is also through the Sabin Vaccine Institute that I met some other extraordinary individuals including H. R. Shepherd, the founding Sabin Board Chair who died this year at the age of 89; Ambassador Michael Marine, (Sabin CEO); Brian Davis (Sabin COO); Mrs. Heloisa Sabin; and the current Sabin Board Chair, Mort Hyman, who is a unique combination of mentor and friend.",

Simultaneously under the leadership of Dr. Paul Klotman, Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) President and CEO (also an ardent advocate and champion of global health), we have established a unique National School of Tropical Medicine to train a new generation of healthcare professionals in this area.2 Our tropical medicine clinic at the Ben Taub General Hospital (also linked with BCM) has opened and already we are seeing patients with Chagas disease, cysticercosis, and elephantiasis. We believe that we have uncovered a hidden burden of neglected tropical diseases in Texas!3",

First, I will address important aspects of tropical diseases that go beyond their health impact and examine tropical infections in a larger context of their economic and geopolitical effects. Second, given this level of global importance I want to call on the tropical disease community to consider a broad and \u201caudacious\u201d goal to eliminate the tropical infections affecting the world's poor. Finally, I hope to highlight a new opportunity we have to address tropical disease elimination goals as a means to implement international science diplomacy.",

There are approximately 3\u20134 billion cases of tropical infections worldwide, but these diseases are disproportionately shared between the bottom billion. By this statement I mean that much of the bottom billion is polyparasitized and therefore infected simultaneously with several tropical diseases, such as hookworm with malaria, schistosomiasis, or strongyloidiasis; onchocerciasis with loiasis; and ascaraisis with trichuriasis.17 Moreover, certain tropical infections such as female genital schistosomiasis or malaria appear to increase susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS).17",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently created a list of 17 common NTDs,9 and the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases recognizes an expanded list of almost 40 NTDs. A common element of the NTDs, and one that we will return to later, is their ability to actually cause poverty because of their profound effects on child growth and cognitive and intellectual development, pregnancy outcome, and agricultural worker productivity.10,13 The NTDs are also the most common infections of girls and women living in poverty.20 Together, the NTDs represent the most prevalent adverse health conditions among the world's poor living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). I often tell my lay colleagues, the NTDs are the \u201cmost important diseases you never heard of.\u201d",

In my book Forgotten People, Forgotten Diseases: The Neglected Tropical Diseases and their Impact on Global Health and Development, I credit Professor Jeffrey Sachs and his Report of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health for first highlighting the economic importance of malaria and other diseases.25 In my book and in subsequent papers, I summarize the stealth ability of NTDs to impair child development and agricultural productivity.1,13,25 Many of the adverse health effects of the NTDs operate through their ability to impair human nutrition. Some of the effects of NTDs on promoting hunger and even famine is summarized in Table 3 . Diseases such as lymphatic filariasis have been shown to reduce agricultural productivity in LMICs such as in Ghana and India; blinding eye disease from trachoma and onchocerciasis disables agricultural workers; and hookworm, schistosomiasis, and malaria produce a \u201cperfect storm of anemia\u201d that reduces productive capacity.13 Thus, malaria and the NTDs have a pivotal role in the world's food crisis.26",

During the 1980s and 1990s, China became one of the first large countries to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem through MDA with the drug diethylcarbamazine citrate.4,25,32 The success of this enterprise in China in turn built on the pioneering work conducted by Frank Hawking (father of the cosmologist Stephen J. Hawking) and others during the 1950s and 1960s.25,32 Through widespread MDA requiring more than a billion treatments annually with low-cost diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin (Mectizan\u00ae) and albendazole donated by Merck & Co. and GlaxoSmithKline, respectively, lymphatic filariasis has now been eliminated as a public health problem in more than 20 LMICs.4 Similarly donated ivermectin has resulted in the elimination of onchocerciasis from Mali and Senegal, and will soon lead to onchocerciasis elimination in Latin America; donated azithromycin (Zithromax\u00ae), together with simple surgeries, facial cleansing, and environmental control, have led to trachoma elimination in more than a dozen countries.4 Thus, MDA has become a powerful global tool in eliminating these three devastating NTDs.",

With the economic downturn disproportionately affecting the United states and Europe, we will depend more than ever on the emerging economies and the Middle East to step up and contribute to NTD efforts.38 In this sense, the long-standing commitment of the government of Kuwait to onchocerciasis control and elimination is especially welcomed.",

How then should we move to accelerate NTD control and elimination efforts globally? Together with Dr. Bernard Pecoul of the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, I have argued that it is critical to move away from a concept put forward by some global health experts of the \u201ctool-ready\u201d NTDs, i.e., diseases currently being targeted by MDA, versus \u201ctool-deficient\u201d NTDs, i.e., diseases not yet amenable to MDA.39 Instead, we countered that all NTDs are \u201ctool-ready\u201d in the sense that we can go a long way towards controlling or even in some cases eliminating complicated kinetoplastid infections such as HAT, Chagas disease, and kala-azar through case detection and treatment together with integrated vector management.39 In parallel, almost all NTDs are \u201ctool-deficient;\u201d e.g., in areas of high transmission of hookworm infection and schistosomiasis, there are rapid rates of post-treatment re-infection and in many instances, such as single-dose mebendazole treatment of hookworm, MDA is simply not effective even in reducing prevalence.39,40 Therefore as a \u201cmanifesto\u201d for accelerating a global assault on the NTDs, it is necessary to scale-up MDA in parallel with conducting research and development (R&D) to produce a new generation of appropriate technologies, including new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines.39,41 A key point here is that we must expand MDA and international R&D efforts simultaneously.",

The scientific hurdles to develop such life-saving products aside, we face the looming problem of how to fund R&D for new products and their industrial scale manufacture. Recently, I advocated for allocating 1\u20132% of President Obama's Global Health Initiative, which would infuse US$100\u2013200 million into the system to support antipoverty products.41 The Global Health Initiative support of NTD products would require co-support through global R&D funds provided by emerging economies and the Middle East. Critical allies in the development of new antipoverty vaccines will be collaborations between the PDPs and a group of vaccine manufacturers belonging to the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN).42 For development of hookworm and schistosomiasis vaccines, the Sabin Vaccine Institute collaborates with DCVMN members, FIOCRUZ BioManguinhos and Instituto Butantan; and we work with the Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional in Mexico (Dr. Jaimie Ortega) and Birmex (Dr. Samuel Ponce de Leon Rosales) on the Chagas disease vaccine. Such partnerships will be critical for ensuring global access for antipoverty vaccines. The DCVMN represents a potent force for ensuring manufacture of new antipoverty vaccines for the bottom billion. They will be essential for realizing the vision of this \u201cDecade of Vaccines\u201d that was announced in 2010 by the Gates Foundation.1",

To understand this concept, we must look to the legacy of Dr. Albert Sabin, who during the late 1950s developed the oral polio vaccine jointly with Soviet virologists. This period coincided with an apex in the Cold War in the years immediately after the launch of Sputnik and the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb by the Soviet Union. Despite heightened political tensions, the polio collaboration provided proof-of-concept for how two nations can set aside ideologies for purposes of vaccine development, something that I have termed \u201cvaccine diplomacy.\u201d43,44 Based on our successful collaborations with members of the DCVMN, I have started to ask if there might be modern day examples of vaccine diplomacy, particularly with nations that 1) often differ ideologically with the United States, 2) have capacity for vaccine development and production, and 3) simultaneously have high rates of NTDs. Among the more poignant examples would be NTD-endemic Islamic nations of strategic security interests to the United States, such as Indonesia, Iran, and Pakistan.43,44 A number of countries where vaccine diplomacy might one day be practiced is shown in Table 5 . Such collaborations will be fraught with political challenges but potentially they also offer huge rewards.",

Although global poverty will require decades or even centuries to eradicate, globally we can break this vicious cycle as we now have the technical ability to eliminate all of the high prevalence NTDs as public health problems. It will require an unprecedented level of international cooperation to expand current levels of MDA coverage and scientific collaborations to produce new drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and insecticides as necessary.4 I believe an important role for our ASTMH will be to continue serving as a neutral forum for scientific debate and discussion on the global elimination of tropical diseases.
