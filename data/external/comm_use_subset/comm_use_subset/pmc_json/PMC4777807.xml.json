Parvo virus infection is most commonly manifested with signs like, vomiting, bloody diarrhea and severe leukopenia. Outbreaks of CPV have been reported from many countries including India. The prevalence study in India was first reported by Balu and Thangaraj [3] in Madras. The pattern of disease experienced in a population is largely influenced by the susceptibility of host, environmental conditions such as housing, hygiene, population density, and pathogenicity of the infectious agent [4].",

            "text": "The study revealed an overall prevalence of canine parvovirus infection in suspected dogs to be 40.85% on the basis of PCR assay. In the present study, a low incidence rate was observed as other cases screened positive for hookworm infection. The above finding was in accordance with those of Phukan et al. [7] to some extent, who reported 42.29% incidence of CPV infection among suspected dogs by sandwich ELISA method in Assam, India. Srinivas et al. [8] also reported 53.90% incidence by PCR assay using H primer in five states of southern India. However, higher incidences were reported by Phukan et al. [9] such as 64% positive by sandwich ELISA and 76% by indirect ELISA. Singh et al. [10] reported a higher incidence of 63%. Such high incidence might be due to prevalence of endemic infection in the population under study. In contrast Joshi et al. [11] reported lower incidences up to 23.02% by counter immunoelectrophoresis, which might be due to the less sensitivity of detection method. However, these variations observed in the prevalence are difficult to explain due to the different study area and difference in the methods of sample analysis. Breed-wise distribution of CPV revealed Deshi/local breeds (34.48%) were more prone to this infection than that of exotic breeds. Similar findings were reported previously [12] where 27.23% incidence was observed in the local breed. Shukla et al. [13] also reported higher prevalence of 56.9% in nondescript dogs and a lower prevalence of 20% in Dalmatian breed. More incidences in Deshi breeds might be due higher population density of this breed making their close proximity to spread the infection or poor vaccination schedule being followed by the owners of Deshi breed due to lack of awareness among them. No specific comments can be made on breed susceptibility as the population density of breeds varies from one geographical area to another [13]. Among the exotic breeds, German shepherd and Labrador retriever were found to be more susceptible with incidences of 17.24% and 10.34%, respectively. It was reported earlier that medium and large breeds are more susceptible to CPV infection [14-16]. Therefore, it might be a reason for a higher incidence in German shepherd and Labrador retriever. Singh et al. [10] reported breed wise prevalence of CPV was highest in Doberman (77.78%), followed by Spitz (78.57%), German shepherd (70.00%), Labrador (68.75%), Pomeranian (45.45%). Mixed breeds were also susceptible to infection at the same rate as that of Labrador retriever, followed by lower incidences in other breeds such as Rottweiler, Spitz, Dalmatian, Pug, Great Dane, Nea politan mastiff. These breeds are rarely kept by pet owners; hence, this might be a reason for the lower incidence. Age-wise prevalence was found to be more between the age group of 3-6 months (below 6 months), followed by age group of 1-3 months, 6-12 months and the least above 12 months. This higher prevalence rate below 6 months also reported earlier [8,17-19]. The higher incidence of CPV below 6 months might be due to the affinity of the virus for rapidly multiplying intestinal crypt cells in weaning pups with higher mitotic index due to changes in bacterial flora as well as in the diet due to weaning [20,21]. The fall in maternal antibody level after 3 months age might be one of the predisposing factors, which make the age group of 3-6 months old more prone to CPV and as they advance in age become prone to the infection in endemic areas due to decline in protective titers [12,21]. Above 1 year age, very less incidences were recorded, which might be possible due to developed antibody in the adults either due to vaccination schedule practiced or due to mild exposure to virus leading to build up antibody in the host or some other reasons that need to be explored. In contrast Phukan et al. [7] reported highest incidence in the age group of 7-12 months followed by 1-6 month, 13 months and above. The prevalence in the age of 7-12 month might be due to improper age or timing of vaccination, non-boostering of the animals and improper maintenance of cold chain for storage of vaccines [22]. We found that males are mostly susceptible to parvovirus infection than that of females. Of 29 positive cases, 25 (86.21%) were males, and 4 were females (13.79%). The present finding was corroborated with Gombac et al. [23]. Thomas et al. [24] also reported a higher incidence of CPV (78.26%) in male dogs. Reason behind this high incidence in males may be because most of the admitted dogs (70.42%) were male [24]. However again it can be explained that as male dogs are mostly suffering from an infection, for which more male dogs were being admitted for treatment. The higher incidence in males was also reported by Phukan et al. [7], Srinivas et al. [8], Tajpara et al. [12], Deka et al. [20] and Thomas et al. [24]. However, some workers reported that there was no influence of sex on the incidence of CPV [25,26]. The high prevalence of CPV in male dogs might be due to more chance of exposure due to certain behavioral pattern and selective preference of keeping male dogs by pet owners [20,27].",
