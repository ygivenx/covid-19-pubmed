For example, serotypes 3, 6B, 9N and others are associated with nasopharyngeal colonization but also with infections in patients with underlying diseases, and with higher mortality when causing pneumonia. In contrast, dominating clones of serotypes 1 and 8 are frequently found in invasive diseases that, however, show lower case-fatality rates [4\u20137]. Among serotype 1 pneumococci, the recently emerging MLST306 clone now dominates by over 80% in many parts of the world [8\u201313]. While the degree of encapsulation positively associates with colonization prevalence and virulence [5], other bacterial factors that affect the interaction with the host\u00b4s innate immune system might also play a role.",

PLY is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins expressed by various Gram-positive bacteria. PLY of most pneumococci binds to cholesterol-containing membranes, forms pores upon oligomerization, and thereby causes cell lysis [15,16]. At sublytic concentrations, PLY has been described to activate the complement system and to stimulate cytokine production in monocytes and macrophages [1,14]. Moreover, PLY has been implicated in biofilm formation, independent of its haemolytic activity [17]. Studies in mouse models of primary pneumococcal pneumonia demonstrated that PLY-deficient strains are more rapidly cleared from the lungs and induce less inflammation compared to isogenic toxin-producing bacteria [18\u201320]. Interestingly, PLY exists in at least 16 different protein variants with variable haemolytic activity. For example, allele 5 PLY expressed by serotype 1 MLST306 and some serotype 8 pneumococci is non-haemolytic in contrast to the allele 1 PLY of the D39 strain [9,21,22].",

Canonical inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes mainly expressed in monocytes and macrophages. They are composed of a receptor molecule belonging to the NOD-like receptor family (such as NLRP3) or the PYHIN protein family (e.g. AIM2), the adapter molecule ASC and caspase-1 [27,28]. Inflammasomes post-transcriptionally regulate the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 by a caspase-1-dependent processing of the cytokine pro-forms into mature cytokines, and induce an inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Mice lacking inflammasome components or receptors for IL-1 or IL-18 show an altered susceptibility towards S. pneumoniae [23\u201326,29,30], indicating that inflammasomes are critical components of the innate defence system during pneumococcal infection.",

Accordingly, haemolytic allele 1 PLY stimulated a much stronger IL-1\u03b2 production in human lungs as compared to non-haemolytic allele 5 toxin (Fig 3B). These data indicate that the polymorphism in PLY also affects production of IL-1\u03b2 in human lung tissue.

Second, we treated the lung tissue with the inhibitor Glibenclamid. Glibenclamid blocks potassium channels that are required for NLRP3 inflammasome activation [42], and is therefore frequently used as a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor [43]. We found that inhibition of NLRP3 strongly reduced the S. pneumoniae-induced IL-1\u03b2 production (Fig 4C).

It senses pneumococcal PLY in murine macrophages and mediates production of the key inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 [23,24]. Accordingly, mice deficient in inflammasome components or receptors for IL-1 or IL-18 show an altered susceptibility towards S. pneumoniae [23\u201325,29,30]. Although rodents, and in particular mice, are widely used in biomedical research, increasing evidence suggests that some mechanisms and pathways of the immune system differ between rodents and humans. It is therefore important to prove the relevance of mechanisms that have been identified in murine models in human-relevant systems. In this study, we used an ex vivo explant model allowing for the investigation of bacterial [34] and viral infections in human lung tissue [44,45]. We demonstrate that the detection of PLY by the NLRP3 inflammasome is also critically involved in the production of IL-1\u00df in human lung tissue. Furthermore, various pneumococcal strains expressing natural PLY variants differentially induce inflammasome-dependent IL-1\u03b2 production by human cells and lung tissue.",

Taken this fact together with epidemiological data might indicate that cytolytic activity is not an essential characteristic of pneumococci for being virulent. Non-cytolytic properties of PLY are at least similarly important. Moreover, the different activities of PLY might be even less essential for secondary pneumococcal pneumonia following influenza virus infection [49].",

The expression of allele 5 PLY enables serotype 1 pneumococci to avoid the detection by inflammasomes and to minimize the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines. We speculate that the evasion of inflammasome-dependent detection by serotype 1 contributes to its ability to invade sterile compartments. Of note, expression of haemolytic PLY has additionally been shown to be required for the detection of pneumococcal peptidoglycan by NOD2 and DNA by a STING dependent pathway, respectively [47,50\u201352]. Avoiding recognition by those pathways might thus also add to the relative particularity of serotype 1 pneumococci. Potentially in line with this assumption, serotype 1 pneumococci appear to be weak inducers of Il1b mRNA (Fig 1I). Moreover, it is likely that other PLY-independent characteristics of this strain such as e.g. capsule or cell wall composition influence the interaction with the host\u00b4s innate immune system. For example, we recently showed that serotype 1 bacteria differ to other serotypes in their binding to the C-type lectin receptor Mincle [53].",
