The length of the CDV genome is 15,690 nucleotides (nt), and it possesses a single-stranded negative RNA encoding six nonoverlapping transcriptional units producing eight proteins [1, 2]. The genomic RNA that is tightly encapsulated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein serves as a template for transcription and replication by the viral polymerase (L) protein and its cofactor phosphoprotein (P). The N, P, and L proteins together with the viral RNA constitute the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) [3], which directs the sequential synthesis of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from six transcriptional units or the replication of full-length encapsulated antigenomes [4]. The viral envelope contains two integral membrane proteins, fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (H), as well as, a membrane-associated protein [matrix (M)] that altogether establish the contact with the RNP [5]. The H glycoprotein facilitates the binding of the virus to the cell membrane; the F protein accomplishes the fusion of the two membranes, which enables the entry of the viral RNP into the cytoplasm [6].",

To further analyze the identified recombination event, the strain JX681125/HLJ1-06 was utilized as the query in the SimPlot program (Fig 3A). One potential breakpoint was localized at the parsimonious region, 12771\u201314312 bp, as identified by the maximization of X2. The sequence of HLJ1-06 showed greater affinity with one putative parent lineage of Hebei position 1\u201312770 and 14313\u201315690 bp than the other putative parent Phoca/Caspian/2007. However, the sequence of Phoca/Caspian/2007from 12771\u201314312 bp shared a greater similarity with HLJ1-06 than Hebei. An identical evidence was displayed by the Boot Scan result (Fig 3B). Owing to the difference in the breakpoint regions in SimPlot and RDP, we selected the total partial 12922\u201314259 bp region for analysis. The recombination events were further substantiated by constructing the phylogenetic tree using MEGA 5.0. In the putative non-recombinant regions (positions 1\u201312921 + 14260\u201315690), HLJ1-06 and Hebei were clustered into the same sub-lineage (Fig 3C), while Phoca/Caspian/2007 was grouped into a distinct sub-lineage. However, in the putative recombinant regions, 12922\u201314259 bp, the arrangement of the phylogenetic tree reflecting the relationship of the three isolates contradicted the previous tree (Fig 3D). The topology of the two phylogenetic trees around the breakpoint showed a significant statistical discrepancy when the PDV was included in the analyzed data (Shimodaira\u2013Hasegawa test, p < 0.001) constituting a robust evidence for recombination.",

Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the CDV genomes, all the CDV isolates were divided into six lineages: Asia-1, Asia-2, Asia-3, Europe, America-1, and America-2. According to the phylogenetic analysis, all the CDV isolates detected in naturally occurring cases clustered according to the geographical distribution. Comparing the phylogenetic trees between CDV genome sequences and six individual gene sequences, the topology of the phylogenetic trees in every individual gene were found to have a high identity with the phylogenetic tree of the genome sequence. Furthermore, the sequence homology of the CDV genome exhibited a high similarity than the six individual genes.",

Recombination, especially between different serotypes, may accelerate the evolution of the virus effectuating a rapid change in its epidemiology [39]. In this study, nine groups of potential recombination events were detected by RDP4 and SimPlot programs, and the six potential recombination events included six recombination strains (JX681125/HLJ1-06, AY445077/98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, AY466011/98-2654, AB462810/007Lm-1vp, and AB474397/007Lm). According to the phylogenetic analysis, the JX681125/HLJ1-06 strain belongs to the group of Asia-1. The other three strains, AY445077/98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, and AY466011/98-2654, belonged to the group of America-1. The remaining two strains, AB462810/007Lm-1vp and AB474397/007Lm, belonged to the group of Asia-2. Similar to that reported previously [40], we confirmed that JX681125/HLJ1-06, AB462810/007Lm-1vp, and AB474397/007Lm were wild-type strains. On the contrary, the other three strains, AY445077/98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, and AY466011/98-2654 were vaccine strains but not artificial [41]. Moreover, it could be speculated that the strains of the same group may have a high homology, thereby leading to similar recombination events. Thus, the six sequences were aligned using ClustalW and compared by DNAStar. Consequently, we found that the three strains, AY445077/98-2645, AY542312/98-2646, and AY466011/98-2654, showed a high sequence similarity (> 99%) with each other (date not shown), as well as, the other two strains (AB462810/007Lm-1vp and AB474397/007Lm). Finally, the three strains, X681125/HLJ1-06, AY445077/98-2645, and AB462810/007Lm-1vp, were selected as representatives for further analyses.",

These results suggested that all the phylogenetic trees supported the recombination result obtained from RDP4 and SimPlot analyses.

During the replication of their genomes, the nucleotide substitutions occur at high frequencies presumably to allow rapid adaptations to various selection pressures [43]. In the current study, considering that the six individual genes were vital to CDV, we assessed the nucleotide selection pressure in the six individual genes (H, F, P, N, M, L). No previous studies suggested whether these six individual genes were under negative or positive selection. In this study, the mean ratio of dN and dS rates (dN/dS) for the six individual genes were both < 1, and the rate for the six individual genes was M (0.074) < L (0.082) < N (0.095) < H (0.263) < F (0.310) < P (0.352) (S2 Table). These result indicated that the six individual genes were under purifying selection; P was under stronger negative selection than other genes, while M exhibited a highly conserved property. This finding strongly correlated with the higher evolutionary rate of P compared to other genes and postulated the correlation of the selection pressure and the rate of evolution [44, 45]. We also found nine positive selection sites (H-178, N-456, M-312, L-2137, F-79/110, and P-148/256/278), especially, positive natural selection involved in immune escape could cause similar sequences to evolve in unrelated strains.",
