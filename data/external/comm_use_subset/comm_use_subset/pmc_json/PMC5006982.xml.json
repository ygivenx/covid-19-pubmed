            "text": "In March 2009, infections with the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus were first reported in Mexico and the United States of America. The virus rapidly spread worldwide [1]. As a consequence, in June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global influenza pandemic [2]. A year later, in August 2010, the global pandemic was officially announced as ended [3]. Eventually, more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities reported laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 18,449 deaths [4]. Accordingly, the influenza A (H1N1) virus became a major public health problem around the world. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, several epidemiological studies examined infection rates and risk factors leading to H1N1 infection among healthcare personnel (HCP) [5,6]. Due to close contact with infected patients, HCP are exposed to infectious microbes and therefore vulnerable to occupationally acquired infectious diseases such as influenza A (H1N1) [7]. In the United States of America the estimated annual death rate among HCP due to occupational infections was between nine and 42 deaths per million HCP [8]. However, the risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection for HCP was not definitively clarified. The present review therefore aimed to record systematically and assess the published literature relating to the occupational risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP during the 2009 pandemic. To examine whether HCP ran an increased risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection during the 2009 pandemic, a meta-analysis was performed.",

Studies were included if the study population comprised healthcare professionals who had direct contact with patients and/or colleagues. It was specified that the occupation in healthcare had to involve exposure to infectious patients or materials. Studies with different or no occupational exposure were not considered. Moreover, studies were included if they used employees in (non-)healthcare without occupational exposure or reference data related to the general population from other studies as control/comparison group. Thereby the authors distinguish between population-based controls/comparisons (e.g. general population, non-healthcare professionals) and hospital-based controls/comparisons e.g. other healthcare professionals). Studies that did not report any valid control/comparison group or reference data were excluded. Outcome measures were laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infection, seroconversion or seropositivity. According to the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI), evidence of influenza A (H1N1) should be verified by one of the following direct or indirect testing methods: rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT), immuno-fluorescent antibody test (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), haemagglutination inhibition test (HAI), microneutralisation test (MN) or viral isolation (VI) or culture (VC) [12]. Studies with no evidence of influenza A (H1N1) or with evidence of other types of influenza (B, C) and other subtypes of influenza A were excluded. Primarily, observational studies (e.g. cross-sectional studies, cohort studies and case-control studies) were included. Other study designs such as surveillance studies were also considered when the studies reported the total number of HCP, also stratified by hospital department and clinical occupation if possible. Articles were not limited to peer-reviewed publications. Content analyses, discussion papers, conference proceedings, theses and letters to the editor were also included. Publications that focused on the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic were included. Studies describing earlier pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks, or patients/residents in healthcare settings only were excluded. Therefore, articles relating to investigations between March 2009 and December 2010 were considered. Finally, there were no linguistic or geographical restrictions.",

Eleven items were taken from two standardised and well-validated checklists and modified [13\u201315]. Three were added by the authors. The items are expressed as questions (e.g. \u201cAre the study design and sampling method appropriate for the research question?\u201d). The answers are graded as yes (1 point), no (0 points) and unable to determine (0 points).

            "text": "Since an adequate number of studies were available, a meta-analysis was conducted by JL and CW. A study was involved in the meta-analysis if it included the following data for HCP (experimental) and non-HCP (control/comparison): cases (H1N1 pos.), non-cases (H1N1 neg.) and sample size (n). Seropositivity for influenza A (H1N1) was given if the HAI antibody titre was \u2265 1:40 or the RT-PCR value was \u2264 38 [12,16]. If multiple diagnostic tests were reported in the studies, the most recognised testing method was used to report the final estimate. In this case HAI and RT-PCR were used. Both tests are universally applicable, well validated and frequently used in studies investigating influenza A (H1N1). The purpose of the analysis was to compute combined effect estimates for influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP, using the Mantel-Haenszel method for binary outcomes. Pooled prevalence ratios, odds ratios (OR) as effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. In a subgroup analysis, studies were stratified by study quality (high and moderate). The presence of heterogeneity was tested using the \u03c7\u00b2 test, taking p < 0.10 as the level of significance. An I\u00b2 test was performed to quantify the diversity between studies. With a sensitivity analysis, the impact of the single studies on the pooled effect estimate finding was verified by stepwise excluding studies from the meta-analysis and examining the estimate stability [17]. In the event of a clear difference in the combined estimate (OR) or I\u00b2, the studies were excluded from further analyses. Possible publication bias due to study size was assessed graphically by means of a funnel plot. The bias is indicated by asymmetry in the plot. If applicable an Egger\u2019s linear regression calculation was carried out to test the probability of publication bias by regression analysis [18]. The level of significance for asymmetry is taken as p < 0.10, the calculated intercept is given with a 90% confidence range. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.3).",

Four studies each were carried out in North America (United States of America and Canada) and in Europe (Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands and Scotland). Three studies were based in Oceania (Australia and New Zealand) and one study in Central America (Mexico). Around 40% of the studies (n = 8) were carried out in general hospitals, five studies in acute care and five in tertiary care hospitals (emergency departments and influenza units), three studies in general practices and one study each in nursing homes, outpatient clinics and primary care medical centres. A variety of healthcare professionals were included in the studies as study subjects (e.g. physicians, general practitioners, nurses, nursing/doctors assistants, therapists, technicians, allied health/support and administrative staff). All studies performed standardised laboratory tests to confirm the evidence of influenza A (H1N1) infection among study participants. Most studies used the haemagglutination inhibition test (HAI; n = 17) or the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction method (RT-PCR; n = 10). Eight of the twenty studies (40%) completed a confirmatory test [16,23,24,29\u201333]. Almost all studies (n = 19) used blood samples as influenza A (H1N1) diagnostic method [16,19\u201321,23\u201326,28\u201338]. Six studies (30%) used nasopharyngeal swabs as additional diagnostic method [20,21,24,28,36,37]. The kind of diagnostic method, blood sample or nasopharyngeal swab, has no impact on the prevalence rate of influenza A (H1N1) among HCP or controls/comparisons (data not shown). The sample size ranged from 66 to 15,018 participants. Prevalence rates for 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP varied from 1.7% to 27.1%. Eight out of twenty studies (40%) used population-based controls (e.g. general population and non-HCP), eleven (55%) used hospital-based comparisons (e.g. nurses, technicians, students, auxiliary, support and administrative staff) and one study (5%) used reference data from the general population in their study. Prevalence rates among controls/comparisons ranged between 1.0% and 30.0%. Nine high quality [16,26,29\u201331,33\u201335,37] and two moderate quality [38,39] studies showed higher H1N1 prevalence rates for HCP compared to controls/comparisons. Based on the eight quality criteria, fourteen studies (70%) were of high quality (\u2265 10 points) [16,21,23,24,26,29\u201337,40,41] and six studies (30%) of moderate quality (\u2265 5 points) [19,20,25,28,38,39]. The most frequent reasons for moderate quality were weaknesses relating to the response rate, description of non-responders, control group and confirmatory test.",

Three studies were based in North and South America (United States of America and Brazil). Half of the studies (n = 3) selected tertiary care hospitals/medical centres as the study location. The remaining studies (n = 3) were conducted in general hospitals/medical centres. All six studies performed laboratory tests, with RT-PCR being the most-used testing method (n = 5). For all studies the utilisation of a confirmatory test is unknown [6,22,27,42\u201344]. Four out of six studies (67%) used blood samples as diagnostic method [27,42\u201344]. Two studies (33%) used nasopharyngeal swabs [6,22]. The sample size varied from 282 to 59,270 study subjects. Prevalence rates for HCP ranged between 2.5% and 40.0%. Three studies (50%) involved control groups in their study, two studies population-based controls (e.g. administrative staff) and one study a hospital-based control (asymptomatic HCP, e.g. nurses and nurse technicians). The remaining studies (n = 3) used hospital-based comparisons (e.g. healthcare assistants and administrative staff). Prevalence rates for controls/comparisons varied from 0.6% to 2.8%. Three moderate quality studies [42\u201344] found higher H1N1 prevalence rates for HCP compared to controls/comparisons. Five out of six studies (83%) were of moderate [22,27,42\u201344] and one study (17%) of high quality [6].",

The results show that risk estimates vary from study to study. Three high quality studies [6,21,41] and one moderate quality study [25] report a significantly higher risk for HCP compared to controls/comparisons. One study found that the odds were six times higher for physicians in comparison with other professions (e.g. technicians; OR = 6.03, CI = 2.11 to 17.82) [6]. Nukui and colleagues showed similar results. In this study physicians and nurses ran a five times higher odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection than co-medical staff (OR = 5.25, CI = 1.21 to 22.7) [25]. Another study reported a significantly increased odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection for nurses compared to administrative or other staff (OR = 2.7, CI = 1.11 to 6.37) [21]. Chen and colleagues found consistent results for nurses in comparison with allied health staff (OR = 6.1, CI = 1.4 to 26.0) [41]. In contrast to this, one high quality study found a significantly lower risk for HCP compared to other personnel (e.g. soldiers; RR = 0.26, CI = 0.07 to 0.46) [23]. Six high quality studies [32\u201337] and one moderate quality study [43] showed no significantly higher or lower risk of influenza A (H1N1) infection for HCP in comparison with non-HCP.",

Moreover, the personal protective equipment (PPE) use among HCP is a frequently investigated topic in infectious diseases research. Many studies analysed the efficacy of PPE like surgical masks, gowns, gloves, goggles, N95 respirators and face shields as well as of hand hygiene [5,19,24,25,37,39,43].

The odds ratios calculated in the sensitivity analysis ranged from 1.98 (1.63 to 2.41) to 2.20 (1.85 to 2.63). They were all statistically significant. The I\u00b2 value ranged from 23% to 41%.

In addition, the studies used different methods to perform investigations. Study populations, case definitions and cut-off values for seropositivity of influenza A (H1N1) vary from study to study. According to the literature the cut-off value for seropositivity is for HAI \u2265 1:40 [16]. Only one study defined a test result already as seropositive for influenza A (H1N1) if the HAI antibody titre was \u22651:20 [34]. Seven studies used the current cut-off value of \u2265 1:40 [16,29\u201331,33,37,38]. In one study the case definition is not clear as the authors used different cut-off values for seropositivity depending on the vaccination status [36]. Two studies used RT-PCR as the only diagnostic method [39,44]. The type of diagnostic test, HAI or RT-PCR, has no influence on the results of our meta-analysis.

Three studies [36,37,44] used nasopharyngeal swabs as additional testing method. Almost all studies were of high quality (8 out of 11) and had a good study design (cross-sectional study or cohort study). The forest plot also indicates that the confidence intervals belonging to the odds ratios overlap widely. It can be assumed that the degree of inconsistency between the studies is low [56]. Finally, the stratification by control and comparison group confirmed the higher odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP compared to controls/comparisons.",

The pooled analysis showed a statistically significant increase in the odds of influenza A (H1N1) infection among HCP compared to controls/comparisons. Our findings can help to enhance infection control especially during the first period of pandemics. Due to close contact with infected patients in healthcare settings and decreased protective effect of vaccinations, healthcare facilities should intensify their focus on strategies to prevent an infection among HCP. Well-known strategies such as PPE and hand hygiene are suitable, but HCP should be properly educated in these infection control practices.",
