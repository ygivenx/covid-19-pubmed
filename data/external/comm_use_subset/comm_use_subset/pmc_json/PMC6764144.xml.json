            "text": "Influenza virus infection, whether seasonal or pandemic, can cause severe health problems, often leading to pneumonia [1]. The death toll of influenza epidemics is between 250,000 and 500,000 [2]. The latest influenza pandemic was caused by a swine-origin H1N1 virus, which is a triple reassortment of human, avian, and swine strains [3]. The frequent reassortment of influenza virus may cause high mortality and overburden the healthcare system [4]. Innate immunity is the body\u2019s first line of defense against pathogens, and toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR recognition of microbial pathogens is required to initiate the natural immune response. PRRs recognize a variety of conserved molecules of the pathogen, known as the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [5]. TLR7, which is highly expressed in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells [6], is a member of the TLR family that recognizes single-stranded RNA viruses [7] such as the influenza virus. After recognition of PAMP, TLR7 recruits specific linker molecules that bind to TIR domains, such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), and contain TIR structures, and can induce the interferon-\u03b2 linker molecule (TRIF) and then, through a series of signal conduction, eventually lead to cell production of inflammatory factors, type I interferons, chemokines, and antibacterial peptides [8]. Finally, it induces nuclear transfer of NF-\u03baB and activates a signaling pathway that produces an inflammatory response.",

The temperature is hot and humid, the groundwater resources are abundant and the water level is high in the offshore area, and the surface water area is wide because of the perennial rainy weather [12]. This geographical and climatological feature leads to damp fever. Its unique geographical, environmental and climatic characteristics are more suitable for recognizing damp-heat syndrome than those in Central Plains. At present, the study of damp-heat syndrome model is relatively stable and mature. Many scholars believe that it is more reasonable to simulate the humid and hot environment by simultaneously increasing humidity and temperature [13]. Studies have shown that exogenous dampness pathogen is directly related to the infection of viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. The rats were naturally ill by modeling the moist heat environment. Through the detection of their endocrine, pathological morphology, immunity, intestinal bacteria and other indicators, it is considered that the scientific connotation of dampness and heat is a comprehensive concept which combines seasonal climate environment, biological pathogenic factors and organism reflection [14]. It was found that these patients were commonly found in damp syndrome, thus confirming that there was a certain correlation between respiratory tract diseases and dampness by observing the clinical manifestations of patients with respiratory tract virus infection [15]. At the same time, it further indicates that the immune function of patients after infection is reduced, the accumulation of free radicals in the body and the elimination ability are not balanced. After the application of Chinese herbal medicine for removing dampness, not only the virus is directly inhibited, but also the overall immune function of the body is regulated.",

Traditional Chinese medicine has three basic methods for treating exterior syndromes: cool acrid exterior-resolution; warm acrid exterior-resolution; and clearing damp-relieving superficies However, under different circumstances, the efficacy of three traditional Chinese medicines for treating influenza may be different. These three methods have been widely used clinically for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections with satisfactory results. However, the efficacy of three traditional Chinese medicines for treating influenza may be different under different circumstances. We used three drugs to represent these three methods: YQS, GZMHGBT, and XJXRY. The effects of these three drugs in the treatment of mice with influenza were compared under normal conditions to observe the incidence of pneumonia in influenza virus-infected mice and the intervention effect on influenza pneumonia in the humid and hot environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunological mechanisms of three traditional Chinese medicines in the treatment of mice infected with influenza virus FM1 in normal environment and hot and humid environment, and the effects on TLR7/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in lungs of mice. We further explain the scientific principle of \u201ctreating the same disease with different methods\u201d from the perspective of \u201cenvironment-organism-pathogen\u201d, and provide theoretical basis and technical platform for research and development of related anti-influenza medicines in the future.",

In the hot and humid environment, XJXRY clearly exhibited therapeutic effects. Under normal circumstances, GZMHGBT can effectively reduce the lung index of mice with influenza pneumonia and extend the survival time of the animals. XJXRY originated from Wu Jutong\u2019s \u201cWen Bing Tiao Bian.\u201d The prescription is composed of five herbs including honeysuckle, forsythia, Magnolia, Elsholtzia, and lentil flower. It has the effect of dispelling heat and relieving dampness, and has a significant effect on the symptoms of cold and high humidity in the summer. In pharmacology, the heat-clearing actions of Forsythiae fructus are based on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of lignans and phenylethanoid glycosides. The detoxifying effects are attributed to the antibacterial, antiviral and anti-cancer activities of Forsythiae fructus. In addition, the remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities of Forsythiae fructus contribute to its anti-cancer and neuroprotective activities [16]. Experiments have shown that phillyrin isolated from Forsythia has potential protective effects against infection caused by the influenza A virus [17]. Honeysuckle is known as an \u201cantibiotic\u201d in Chinese medicine. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that honeysuckle has clear anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-oxidation, liver protection, anti-tumor and other properties, in which chlorogenic acid has an anti-influenza virus effect and inhibition of neuraminidase [18], which is one of the main components of honeysuckle. Elsholtzia contains flavonoids and coumarins, and has the functions of heat clearing, wetting, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological actions [19]. Honokiol in Magnolia officinalis also has the effect of inhibiting virus replication [20, 21]. In the present study, XJXRY clearly demonstrated therapeutic effects in mice infected with influenza in a hot and humid environment, and reduced pulmonary inflammation in normal WT mice, but had no significant effect on TLR7\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, we speculate that XJXRY may exert anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating key factors (i.e., TLR7, MyD88 and NF-\u03baBp65) of the TLR7 signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Recent studies have shown that the balance between Th17 cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) is of great significance. Interleukin (IL)-17 secreted by Th17 cells can induce IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and prostaglandin E2 in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stromal cells. IL-17 also enhances the function of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on the cell surface and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [22]. Therefore, this cytokine plays a role in promoting the inflammatory response. A recent surprising discovery was that the combination of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2 can induce the conversion of mouse T cells to produce IL-17 (Th17) [23, 24]. Tregs control the reactivity of self-reactive T cells that are not eliminated in the thymus, and are responsible for maintaining the immune system in homeostatic balance [25]. Cells expressing Foxp3+ transcription factors are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis [26]. Endogenous TGF-\u03b2 produced by Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ Treg cells enable IL-6 to convert some of these cells to Th17 cells [27]. FOXP3+ Treg is a CD4+ T cell with immunosuppressive function, and is currently the most studied. They have the strongest inhibitory function, cover the most extensive inhibition, can prevent the activation of autoreactive T cells, inhibit the occurrence of autoimmune and allergic diseases and, thus, play an important role in maintaining autoimmune tolerance [28]. An imbalance of FOXP3+ Treg/Th17 cells may cause the onset of autoimmune and allergic diseases [29, 30]. We detected a proportion of Th17/Tregs in the immune cells of spleen tissue in mice using flow cytometry, and found that the value of Th17/Tregs in the virus control group increased compared with the normal control group, indicating that infection with influenza virus (FM1 strain) could promote the direct differentiation of CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells. The present study demonstrated that the ratio of Th17/Tregs in WT mice of YQS and GZMHGBT have a certain degree of down-regulation under normal environment. However, under hot and humid environment, XJXRY could alleviate the inflammatory reaction and reduce the occurrence of autoimmune injury.",

It inhibits NA activity and thus effectively inhibits the replication and spread of various influenza virus strains. For example, the activity of glycoside hydrolase is to cleave the glycosidic linkage of neuraminic acid to reduce viral transmission and reinfection. Existing scholars have found that oseltamivir is effective in early antiviral therapy [31, 32]. However, further clinical trials and basic studies have shown that delayed treatment with NAIs (more than 48 h after onset) is still effective in preventing influenza infection [33, 34]. It can be seen from our experiments that oseltamivir is very effective against influenza virus-infected mice in normal environment and hot and humid environment, and knockout of TLR7 gene did not completely affect its ability to inhibit virus replication. However, in recent years, researchers have found and confirmed that influenza B and H5N1 viruses are resistant to oseltamivir and have more side effects. Compared with it, the traditional Chinese medicine compound not only has low toxicity, multiple targets, but also is resistant to drug resistance and side effects, and can also regulate the body\u2019s immune response as a whole.",
