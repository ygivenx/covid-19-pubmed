Building ventilation is known to be effective for reducing the spread of airborne diseases such as tuberculosis, SARS, smallpox, chicken pox, and influenza in single indoor environments [8\u201312], but has not been studied at the community level. Ventilation intervention decreases transmission probability by directing the flow of airborne infectious agents away from susceptible persons and/or by removing infectious agents from room air. Because it relies less on individual compliance, ventilation has an advantage over other non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., hand washing or mask use). But questions remain. Is ventilation as effective at the community level as other interventions?",

An individual infected in one building may infect others in the building(s) that he/she subsequently visits. People move from one indoor environment to another, and are in frequent contact with others, creating an indoor contact network in which an airborne disease can spread. To study ventilation as a community-level intervention, the disease spread dynamics must be ideally modeled at the individual person and location level for an entire urban social network [14]. Many widely used social contact network models, such as a random network [15] or a small world network [16, 17], may be too simplistic to describe the complicated dynamic between individuals and indoor environments. Environment parameters such as ventilation cannot be considered in these models, as in these models location is not refined to the individual indoor-space level. More recently, Eubank and colleagues [18, 19] developed a location-based social network model. However, the resources for building a realistic urban network in a large city are generally not available.",

In a large city such as Hong Kong, there are around 7 million people (NP) and an estimated 3 million indoor locations (NL, as a building can have many indoor locations). Ideally, we need to know the probability and duration of any two people meeting in any one indoor space in Hong Kong at any time. That is, we need to know \u201cWho meets whom, where, when, and for how long.\u201d Clearly, to model a large city there is need for a fast algorithm and huge computer storage capacity. The computer storage requirement can be formidably large; it is proportional to the cubic of the population (NP3), assuming that the indoor space population is at the same order of population as in Hong Kong. It is thus unrealistic to trace every individual on an hourly scale in a large city, i.e., when and where each person enters and leaves a room.",

The transmission dynamics of a hypothetical airborne disease outbreak was studied and the effectiveness of different interventions such as isolation, home isolation, and increasing ventilation were evaluated and compared. In this feasibility study, we assumed that this hypothetical airborne disease has the same natural history and infectiousness as smallpox with no pre-existing immunity in the population.",

In all classrooms, if an infector is introduced to the classroom, the rest of the students will develop infection rapidly (due to the long exposure time and low ventilation rate) and the transmission conditions in different classrooms are similar (similar ventilation rates per person). Natural ventilation was suggested by Lee and Chang [42] to be efficient in increasing the ventilation rates of classrooms. As offices are extremely large hubs in the network, reducing infection risks in offices will delay the peak infection. Hence, increasing ventilation rates in homes is essential to protect the public from infection from airborne diseases, whereas applying targeted control methods such as increasing ventilation rates to large location hubs may delay the rise of the epi-curve and provide time for the public to prepare for the outbreak.",

This study also did not consider the geographical contact distribution, which may have a significant influence on the dynamics of infectious disease transmission [43, 44]; the local outbreaks cannot be predicted in the current model.

In reality, respiratory infections may have multiple possible transmission routes [45, 46]. The transmission dynamics and the control effects of different methods might shift with the dominant transmission route or routes. However, the aim of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of ventilation in combination with other intervention methods in controlling a possible airborne disease outbreak on a social contact network, as well as our ability to simulate different scenarios on the theoretical basis. In another study by the authors [47], the role of ventilation in controlling the partially airborne influenza was investigated; it was found that increasing the ventilation rate significantly impacts on the transmission dynamics, even when the airborne route only contributes 20% to the total infection risk. Besides, as the methodology of constructing an indoor contact network provided by this study contains information about both individual-based social contact behavior and local environment transmission risks, a similar methodology could be adopted to model the multiple-routes-transmitted respiratory infections in large cities.",

Most studies have applied a quanta generation rate calculated from historical outbreaks [10, 25, 28, 48, 49]. This method might lead to an over-estimation of the infectivity of the diseases due to the super-spreader effect [33]. Furthermore, the number of outbreak cases with sufficient information to estimate the quanta generation rate is very small, and a significant bias will be introduced by this small number of statistical data. However, other infectious diseases outbreak parameters, such as the basic reproductive number, are well documented for the past infectious disease outbreaks. In this study, we provide a method for investigating the correlations between basic reproductive number and quanta generation rate. The quanta generation in the previous outbreak can be estimated from the basic reproductive number by rebuilding the social contact network during the outbreak period.",
