Collection of additional specimens, particularly from the lower respiratory tract and at different time points over the disease course is highly recommended when there is strong clinical and epidemiological suspicion of MERS-CoV infection and initial results from upper respiratory tract specimens are negative or inconclusive. Drosten et al. pointed out that up to 106 copies/mL of MERS-CoV RNA were present in lower respiratory tract specimens, whereas only small amounts of viral RNAs could be detected in upper respiratory tract specimens [8].",

The above substitution was confirmed independently by two separate CDC laboratories, ruling out the possibility of its introduction during the RT-PCR. The R511P substitution is located within a region (residues 484 to 567) of the MERS-CoV RBD that directly interacts with the dipeptidyl peptidase4 (DPP4) receptor on the host cell surface for viral attachment [9\u201312]. Recent mutagenesis studies indicated that alterations of key residues within that region, i.e., the D510A and the E513A, have been shown to significantly reduce both binding and viral entry efficiency [9, 13]. The same studies indicated that the R511A substitution had little to no effect to the binding affinities of the RBD for DPP4. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the substitution of arginine to proline in the same position (R511P) identified in the present study had any functional implication.",

The estimated neighbor-joining trees were constructed from nucleotide alignments using MEGA version 6.06. Sequence names are derived from Genbank accession number|virus strain name|month-year of collection. Numbers in the parentheses denote additional human sequences identical to the listed sequence. An asterisk (*) denotes 2 additional identical N ORF sequences obtained from IFV, including strains MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C8826 and MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C9055. Two asterisks (**) denote 3 additional identical S ORF sequences obtained from IFV, including MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C9055, MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C7770 and MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C7149. MERS-CoV sequences derived from camel specimens indicated by camel icon. Bootstrap support values (1000 replicates) 75% are plotted at the indicated internal branch nodes. Scale bars show the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.",
