For example, MaxBin [15] uses both tetranucleotide frequencies and contig coverage levels to assign assembled contigs into different bins.",

With the total coverage of 1000-x, three sets of reads are produced using different abundance distributions. The first one is based on the power law equation [26]. The second and the third sets of reads represent challenging cases where different haplotypes have similar abundances, which create difficulties for abundance-based binning algorithms. The abundance differences in the second and third data set are 0.06 and 0.03, respectively. In total, there are 38,914 simulated reads for 5 HIV haplotypes. The relative abundance for five haplotypes in each read set can be found in Table 1.

In addition, sequence composition-based features such as tetranucleotide frequencies are not effective in distinguishing highly similar viral strains. Our experimental results show that VirBin works better for longer contigs that can cover bigger regions of the underlying genomes. When the genome coverage by the contigs is below 70%, the performance of VirBin deteriorates because it becomes harder to estimate the correct number of haplotypes. In addition, the empirical experience shows that it is difficult to classify two viral strains when the abundance difference between them is below 3%. Thus, although we have demonstrated much better contig binning performance for distinguishing viral haplotypes than other contig binning tools, genome-scale viral haplotype construction is still a challenging problem.",

All the other contigs will be aligned to the reference using blast+ [35] to generate an alignment profile similar to multiple sequence alignment.

The other is overlap alignment, which is the alignment between the suffix/prefix strings of the contigs. If not all the shorter contigs can be aligned to the reference contig, this process will continue by using the second longest contig as the reference until all the contigs are used.
