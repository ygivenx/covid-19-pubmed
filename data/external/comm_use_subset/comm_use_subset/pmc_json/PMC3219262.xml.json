While the overall case fatality rate is low (< 0.5%), approximately 9 to 31% of hospitalized patients require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 14 to 46% of these severe patients have a fatal outcome [2-5]. Understanding the pathogenic events leading to critical pandemic H1N1disease is important for designing better strategies for prevention and treatment of severe outcomes. Previous studies examining host immune responses in other emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, suggest that severe disease is characterized by a malfunction of the switch from innate to adaptive immunity in response to the virus [6]. Similar to severe infections caused by H5N1 influenza virus [7] dysregulated cytokine secretion have been described in severe cases of p2009A(H1N1) [8,9]. Infection by pandemic 2009 influenza virus causes defective host responses to S. pneumoniae as showed in ex vivo cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pandemic 2009 influenza (A/H1N1) patients [10]. In ferrets infected with pandemic influenza virus, recovery from infection and improved clinical signs are paralleled by a switch between the innate and the adaptive phase of host immune responses [11].",

Patients older than 65 years and younger than 18 years were excluded from the study to avoid immaturity/aging of the immune system as confusion factor in the analysis. Only those patients with confirmed H1N1 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in the study (n = 19). Serial blood samples for plasma, serum and RNA were collected by using serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and PaxGene (BD) venous blood vacuum collection following the manufacturer's instructions at days 1, 3/5 and 7 after admission to the ICU, according to a unified protocol for all the participant centers. A pharyngeal sample was collected in parallel. Fifteen healthy volunteers of similar age to the patients were recruited between workers of the University of Valladolid, Spain. A standard survey was employed to collect the clinical data, including history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, hematological, biochemical, radiological and microbiological investigation in all the participant centers.

Twelve patients showed respiratory work severe enough for need of invasive mechanical ventilation at ICU admission (these patients were classified as MV group), while none of the remaining seven were mechanically ventilated during their hospitalization (these patients were classified as NMV group). The most common symptoms at onset were fever > 38\u00b0C (cases in MV, cases in NMV) (11, 6), myalgias (8, 6), cough (11, 7) and dyspnea (12, 7). Nine patients of the most severe group and six of the less severe ones had concomitant preexistent conditions (Table 1). None of the patients except one patient of the NMV group who was receiving treatment with bortezomib were under immunosuppressory therapy by the day of admission. Five of 12 MV patients, for four of seven patients in the NMV group, were receiving steroids at the time of sample collection (Table 1). Seven MV patients failed to recover from disease and died with a mean illness duration time of 16.7 and 5.8 days (mean, SD). All NMV patients recovered from p2009A(H1N1) disease.

Three MV patients and one NMV showed detectable viremia at the day of ICU admission, with undetectable virus in plasma afterward. Viral load in pharynx showed a direct correlation with SOFA score (r = 0.4) and an inverse one with O2 saturation (r = -0.3) during the course of the disease. Five MV patients suffered from a bacterial or fungal superinfection at some point during hospitalization (Table 1). Three patients suffering from bacterial superinfection died (Table S1, Additional file 3). Remarkably, none of the patients in the NMV group suffered from bacterial superinfection.

IPA analysis identified in this late phase a significant depression of a group of intracellular signaling pathways important for the development of the antiviral immune response in the most severe group of patients (MV) compared to NMV group (Figure 2). A number of genes involved in antigen presentation (Figure 3), B cell development (Figure S2 in Additional file 4), CD28 signaling in T helper cells (Figure S3 in Additional file 5), granzyme B signaling (Figure S4 in Additional file 6), T helper cell differentiation, protein ubiquitination, dendritic cell maturation, apoptosis and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling were differentially regulated between these two groups and significantly lower in the MV group.

An adequate antigen presentation is needed to develop an effective adaptive immunity to influenza viruses [16]. Under some circumstances, changes affecting antigen presentation more strongly impact viral kinetics in the host than other viral or immune factors [16]. Disruption of antigen presentation prevents an effective adaptive immune response. Evidence on the potential role of an altered antigen presentation on the development of an appropriated adaptive response against the virus comes from the impaired expression of a group of genes pivotal to the activation and function of both T and B cells observed in the MV group in the late phase. Defective expression of CXCR5, MHC class II molecules, IL12RB1, IL21R and IL6R supports an impaired T helper cell differentiation signaling in this group of patients. Poor expression of CD4, FYN, GRB2, MHC class II molecules, ITPR3, MALT1, NFATC1, NFATC3, PDPK1, PIK3R1 and PLCG1 genes indicates a disruption in CD28 signaling in T helper cells, which is needed for effective primary T-cell expansion [17]. Impaired expression of DFFA, ENDOG, NUMA1, PARP1 and PRKDC affects granzyme B signaling. This pathway is involved in the induction of apoptosis in virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) [18]. Impaired T helper cell differentiation, CD28 and granzyme B signalling, along with the poor expression of T cell receptor associated genes (CD4, CD8A, CD8B1), supports a defective T cell response during the phase of adaptive immunity in the MV group. Moreover, the poor expression of genes related to B cell development and B cell receptor signaling (CD79A, CD79B, IL7R, MHC class II molecules, ABL1, CAMK2 D, MALT1, INPP5 D, HRAS, GRB2) points to an altered B cell function during this key period of the host response to the virus.",

            "text": "Additional clues on the existence of a defective adaptive response in severe pandemic influenza come from the impaired expression of a group of genes participating in the apoptosis signaling pathway (AIFM1, BIRC3, CAPN1, CAPN7, CAPNS1, CASP6, DFFA, ENDOG, HRAS, PARP1, PLCG1, TP 53). Since apoptosis is a recognized antiviral mechanism [19], a defect in apoptosis could translate into poor control of the virus. Additionally, defective expression of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin-specific peptidases demonstrates that ubiquitination is also affected in severe pandemic influenza during the phase of adaptive response. Ubiquitination regulates the development of many phases of the immune response, including its initiation, propagation and termination [20]. The alteration of this pathway in severe pandemic influenza could affect in consequence all the steps needed for the development of an appropriate response to the virus. The role of steroids or immunosuppressor drugs in the genesis of the impaired adaptive response should be very limited, since none of the patients of the most severe group were under immunosuppressor treatment by the admission date. In addition, as detailed in Table 1, the proportion of patients under steroid treatment at the moment of sample collection during the hospitalization period was very similar in both groups of patients (41.6% for MV and 57.1% in NMV); in consequence, steroid treatment should affect similarly both groups in terms of modulation of the immune response. The ability showed by the vast majority of the patients in the MV group to produce specific antibodies indicates that antibody generation was insufficient to overcome the infection. Our results on gene expression support a defect in cellular immunity on the basis of the poor control of the virus in this group. It is well known that T helper and CTL responses play a determinant role in the containment of influenza once infection has occurred [21-23]. Our group is now designing further studies aimed at clarifying the participation of cellular responses in the severe disease caused by p2009A(H1N1).",

            "text": "On the other hand, patients of the MV group showed higher expression levels of those genes participating of the IL-6 and IL-10 canonical pathways during the phase of adaptive immunity. These pathways play opposite roles: proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory, respectively. In addition, serum levels of both IL-6 and IL-10 proteins are the highest in the MV group in this phase group which showed also elevated levels of chemokines, Th1 cytokines and growth factors. The presence of hypercytokinemia has been recently reported during infection by p2009A(H1N1) [8]. It has been described also during fatal H5N1 disease, severe SARS [6,7], acute RSV bronchiolitis [24] and sepsis [25]. Positive association between chemokines, cytokines and viral load in our study evidences that they are markers of ongoing viral replication as previously observed in SARS and H5N1 infection [6,12]. The high levels of the immunomodulatory molecules IL-1ra and IL-10 could represent an attempt to prevent cytokine-driven inflammatory damage or alternatively a virus-induced evasion mechanism [26-29]. The positive correlation observed between IL-10, viral load and SOFA, and the negative correlations between this cytokine and the expression levels of the genes participating in the antigen presentation pathway, supports the role of this mediator in favoring viral replication. As detailed in Table 1, bacterial superinfections took place not in the early but in the late course of the disease. This supports the role of the impaired adaptive response and the release of immunosuppressory cytokines in the increased incidence of bacterial superinfection observed in severe disease following infection by p2009A(H1N1) [2].",
