With the occurrence of several early influenza A seasons in recent years, an exploration of longer time trends of different viruses was considered useful to gain more insight in the suggested relationship between circulating viruses. Understanding viral shifts and potential drivers thereof is relevant for further understanding whether certain viruses might promote or inhibit (pandemic) influenza spread and whether influenza vaccination could potentially affect trends in other respiratory viruses.",

Such early occurrence may affect the circulation of other seasonal pathogens, and theories on possible interference between outbreaks of different respiratory viruses have been postulated to be a possible cause of delays in expected seasonal outbreaks of other respiratory viruses.1, 2, 3 While those earlier population\u2010level studies focused mainly on the possible interaction between influenza A virus and rhinovirus circulation, there may also be a relationship between influenza A and other prevalent viruses. Therefore, we investigated trends in several common viruses for which laboratory data were available from national surveillance in the Netherlands for a longer time period of up to 10 years including both respiratory and enteral viruses.",

Submitting laboratories are associated with either hospitals or regional laboratories to which both GPs and hospitals submit samples. The estimated proportion of all positive diagnostics captured by this national surveillance varies between the monitored pathogens and was estimated between 38% (for rotavirus) and 73% (for influenza virus) in a 2002 study of five pathogens.10 The types of tests used can differ between the submitting laboratories and over time. Respiratory viruses were detected in throat swabs mainly by PCR\u2010based methods in respiratory specimens from patients with respiratory disease symptoms. Enteric viruses were detected in fecal samples by EIA\u2010based methods (rotavirus, norovirus) and by PCR\u2010based methods (norovirus). Enterovirus was detected mainly by PCR and in the early years also by culturing, in throat swabs, CNF, and in fecal specimens collected from patients suspected for an enterovirus infection. Cross\u2010reaction between rhinovirus and enterovirus PCRs for throat swab samples cannot be excluded completely. When collected from patients suspected for enterovirus infection, typing of enteroviruses indicated that this was a minority. When collected from patients with respiratory symptoms, enteroviruses might be misidentified as rhinovirus, as occurred during enterovirus D68 outbreaks.11\n",

As general practitioner (GP) influenza sentinel surveillance is the current gold standard for influenza surveillance in the Netherlands (with an epidemic threshold), early influenza A seasons were first identified using published dates of the influenza epidemics. We combined this information with visual inspection (as there is no threshold available) of trends in influenza A laboratory diagnoses reported in the Weekly Virological Records System for confirmation of the early ILI epidemics and for identification of any additional early influenza A seasons according to those laboratory data. A pre\u2010defined cutoff point for the identification of early influenza seasons is not available. Using the published ILI epidemic periods, we identified two relatively early influenza A seasons wherein influenza epidemics started before the turn of the year (i.e., before week 1): the 2003/2004 season (epidemic starting in week 49 lasting to week 4) and the 2009/2010 season (epidemic starting in week 41 lasting to week 51).12, 13 These two early epidemics were also confirmed by visible early increases in influenza laboratory data reported in the Weekly Virological Records System (Figure 1). After visual inspection of the laboratory data, the 2010/2011 season was additionally selected as an early season as influenza A diagnoses were clearly on the rise before week 1 (Figure 1). While the influenza epidemic in the 2008/2009 season did not start early (week 1)8 according to the ILI sentinel surveillance system, in the laboratory surveillance data this season seemed neither clearly early nor clearly late and was therefore excluded (influenza A laboratory diagnoses in this season are represented in Appendix 1).",

To facilitate the inclusion of such a high peak into the presented graphs, the number of influenza A virus laboratory diagnoses during the 2009/2010 season was scaled down (reduced by a factor 13\u00b71, changing the height but not the shape of the epidemic in that year). As the number of influenza B virus laboratory diagnoses was very low during the pandemic, such downscaling was not performed for the influenza B virus laboratory diagnoses. Smoothing of time series was performed by calculating 3\u2010week moving averages (average of current, previous, and next week's value). Correlation coefficients between different viruses were calculated using Spearman's rank correlations for non\u2010normally distributed data.

Almost all of the included respiratory viruses (influenza A and B virus, RSV, coronavirus) except rhinovirus showed very clear seasonality in their reporting over time. The numbers increase, peak, and are elevated during winter season (December\u2013February) or occasionally in very early spring (March\u2013April) (Figure 1 and Appendix 2A\u2013D). However, while influenza B virus diagnoses also displayed such winter seasonality, outbreaks did not occur each winter (five of the ten observed years showed clear influenza B epidemics, while the other 5 years showed very low levels or even near\u2010absence). In our data, rhinovirus levels showed less clear seasonality than the other respiratory viruses. They tended to be elevated over broad periods (Figure 1) and seemed to be present year\u2010round with less pronounced elevations during autumn/winter/spring. Generally, RSV epidemics preceded influenza A virus epidemics, which in turn preceded influenza B epidemics (in the years that influenza B epidemics occurred). Increases in coronavirus also usually preceded increases in influenza A (but not in the 2009/2010 season). The timing of rhinovirus levels relative to influenza A virus in laboratory diagnoses was less clear (due to seemingly year\u2010round presence of rhinoviruses in specimens submitted for laboratory diagnoses).",

As the different viruses might differ in the timing of their occurrence relative to influenza A occurrence, the correlation coefficients were calculated at different time lags (shifted between 10 weeks earlier up to 10 weeks later) to determine the time shift with the maximum correlation with influenza A. When comparing seasons with early versus later occurrence of influenza epidemics, the maximum correlation coefficient was observed at different lags for all viruses. This difference in time lag relative to influenza A occurrence was smallest for influenza B, indicating that influenza B circulation relative to influenza A tends to occur at a more stable delay than for the other viruses. This suggests that changes in timing of influenza A circulation will be accompanied by changes in timing of influenza B circulation. However, such an overall correlation coefficient (calculated over multiple seasons combined) obscured the visual observation that in two of the three early influenza seasons, influenza B virus was almost absent (Figure 2).",

In another study in Beijing, all respiratory virus epidemics, except rhinovirus, were delayed after the pandemic influenza epidemic (data came from fever clinics which screen patients prior to being assigned to a specific hospital department).16 However, both regions have different climates from the Netherlands (and from each other) complicating comparisons. Other European observations have also been reported regarding the effect of rhinovirus on influenza virus circulation. While those reports hypothesize on viral interference between influenza virus and rhinovirus circulation (with rhinovirus delaying influenza spread),1, 2, 3, 17 we (like the Beijing study16) did not observe clear\u2010cut trends in rhinovirus reports in our laboratory diagnoses data. The relationship previously reported between rhinovirus and influenza virus might perhaps be age specific because in one study, the reduced likelihood of A(H1N1)pdm09 detection in rhinovirus\u2010positive samples3 was observed in a pediatric population, as was the reduced likelihood of detecting eight viruses in rhinovirus\u2010positive samples in another study in children,17 while our data were not age specific and we did not have such information on concurrent infections.",

Our data suggest that respiratory viruses may impact each other's seasonality (in this study focused on the relationship between influenza A virus and other respiratory viruses), albeit through unknown mechanisms, as also hinted at by the Beijing and Hong Kong data.15, 16 Virtually all research suggesting interaction between respiratory viruses in human populations has focused on observational (ecological) studies such as ours, most including only one or a few seasons of data while our study included a 10\u2010year period. Only one prospective cohort study has been published (based on one season) which showed rhinovirus and coronavirus to interrupt the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic.18 Our results could not confirm their finding of coronavirus inhibiting influenza A virus circulation, but we observed more coronavirus laboratory reports when influenza A virus circulated early. In contrast to most of the other studies, we could investigate whether patterns recurred due to our longer study period. This revealed that coronavirus laboratory reporting was more intense in 2009/2010 when it did not overlap with influenza A virus circulation. However, it was also more intense in the early influenza A year thereafter (2010/2011) when it actually completely overlapped with the influenza A epidemic hinting that direct biological inhibition of either virus by the other might be unlikely and thus apparent interaction reported by others may have depended on indirect factors or may be spurious. These variations by year in our data illustrate how results from shorter observational studies have to be interpreted with caution, especially when they focus only on 1 year or one season. However, also in our longer study we have to remain cautious; to refute biological inhibition between coronavirus and influenza, it would be helpful to know whether the coronavirus and influenza virus specimens were from the same age group.",

Like previous studies, we did not have information on issues potentially underlying such changes, such as shifts in laboratory testing policy, availability and use of new diagnostic tools, variations in testing intensity due to previous or new outbreaks, and possible outsourcing of certain tests. Furthermore, information on age was not available in our data, possibly diluting trends that might have been visible were data investigated age specifically, or alternatively creating trends and shifts that might otherwise have been absent in certain age groups. If certain age groups are more likely to be hospitalized (such as infants with RSV infection) and/or to be sampled than other age groups and thus overrepresented in the laboratory data, our observed trends might not be representative for the total population if virus circulation trends actually differ between age groups. Future ecological analyses should preferably include age\u2010specific data as this may further clarify the true occurrence of shifted seasonality.

There are several types of virus\u2013virus interactions, described in a review by Da Palma,19 ranging from (i) direct virus\u2013virus interactions (e.g., when nucleic acids or proteins of one virus physically interact with the genes or gene products of a coinfecting virus); (ii) indirect interactions resulting from alterations in the host environment; to (iii) immunological interactions. However, with the current data we cannot determine whether the viruses impacted each other biologically. Further, there are other issues that can impact the timing and magnitude of seasonal epidemics such as environmental, social, and behavioral phenomena that may also be the potential drivers of observed shifts in reporting patterns instead of viral interaction (alone).20 To further attempt to disentangle these issues, future ecological studies should preferably include age\u2010specific virological data over multiple seasons and better yet, cohort studies could be performed that (i) address the order of infection by different viruses (by serial sampling of subjects during the study period regardless of symptoms) as proposed by others;17, 21 (ii) include persons from the same household as was done by Pascalis et al.;18 and (iii) include multiple years and thus multiple seasons per virus.",

As suggested by Greer et al., further studies are relevant in light of the discussion whether rhinovirus promotes (pandemic) influenza spread through coughing and sneezing22 or whether it may paradoxically provide natural protection due to inhibition of influenza infection in those already infected with rhinovirus.17 Further studies may also provide input to the question whether influenza vaccination can render persons more susceptible to other respiratory viruses due to the lack of temporary non\u2010specific immunity induced by actual influenza infection.23 Canadian and Australian researchers hypothesize that through this same mechanism of induced temporary non\u2010specific immunity, the circulation of a seasonal influenza strain preceding a pandemic strain might decrease the susceptibility to that ensuing pandemic strain.24 Not evaluated in our study but possibly also playing a role in virus shifts or virus\u2013virus interactions is the variation in the circulation of influenza A subtypes from year to year. Evaluation of such an effect might require evaluation of longer time series as the first general impression from our data was that there was no clear consistent association with subtype as the three early influenza years were not all dominated by the same influenza A type (H3N2 in 2003/2004, H1N1pdm09 in 2009/2010, and H1N1pdm09 in 2010/2011).13, 25 Further, drift variants of influenza A virus were present both in early and in late influenza A seasons25 and would require closer scrutiny (such as the timing and proportion of drift variant occurrence within seasons and if possible ensuing disease severity) to determine their possible role in disrupted respiratory virus trends.",
