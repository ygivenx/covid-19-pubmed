The revised definition emphasizes organ dysfunction, which can be calculated by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. The SOFA score\u2010based definition of sepsis predicted mortality higher than that of SIRS\u2010based definition. As infection can lead to organ failure, patients with infection should be carefully followed up.5 For ease of application in clinical environments, the laboratory data included in SOFA score were bilirubin, creatinine, and platelet count.",
