Other clinical signs of PED include vomiting and anorexia. PED is characterized by the mortality rate of 30\u2013100% in neonates, and high morbidity but low mortality in weaned pigs [2]. Economic losses due to elevated mortality and decreased production by PEDV are significant in the US swine herds. PED virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of PED. PEDV was detected on multiple US swine farms in April of 2013 [1, 3], and the virus has continued to spread through swine producing states at an alarming rate until the end of 2014. Over 45 779 PEDV tests have been conducted in the US between May 2013 and March 2014, and reported 4757 cases (~10%) positive in 27 states [4].",

This could be attributed to non-availability of reliable diagnostic tools to monitor the protective herd immune status in sows. Moreover, information about levels and duration of PEDV herd immune status in sows is important to implicate appropriate control measures at verge of disease outbreaks. Therefore, it is critical to develop standardized isotype antibody targeted assays to determine the association of clinical samples data with PEDV specific B cell response at the intestines and lymphoid tissues of sows recovered from PED under field conditions. In this study we quantified both PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody levels in the clinical samples (plasma, oral fluid, and feces) and associated that to the isotype specific B cell responses in the intestine and lymphoid tissues of PED infected sows in commercial breeding herds of two different parities (primiparous and multiparous).",

Briefly, confluent Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates were washed once using PBS before seeding the samples. For virus titration, tenfold serially diluted virus stock was added to cells plate in quadruplicate; for VN titration, clinical samples were UV treated (254 nm for 45 min) and heat inactivated (56 \u00b0C for 30 min), and twofold serially diluted samples were incubated with equal volume of PEDV (50 TCID50 per well) for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C, and the mixture was transferred into Vero cells grown in microtiter plates in duplicate. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and infection medium was added after the wells were washed once using PBS and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. Plates were washed and fixed using acetone-Milli-Q water (8:2) mixture for 10 min at RT, and dried completely before immunostained. Cells were treated with anti-PEDV N protein specific monoclonal antibody (SD6-29) (Medgene lab, SD, USA) (1:1000) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, followed by treatment with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen, CA, USA) secondary antibody (1:4000). The plate was examined under a fluorescent microscope after mounting with glycerol-PBS (6:4). The virus induced cytopathic effect was examined under a fluorescent microscope, and the titer was calculated using the Reed and Muench method. The viral titer was expressed in 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per mL. The VN titer was determined to be the reciprocal dilution of plasma/oral fluid/fecal samples that induced greater than 90% inhibition of viral infection as shown in virus control wells (Figure 2).",

(i) Vero cells infected and fixed cell culture plates: PEDV (100 \u03bcL of 104 TCID50/mL) containing 1 \u03bcg/mL of TPCK-trypsin was inoculated to confluent Vero cell monolayers in 96-well tissue culture plate. Cells were fixed with 80% acetone at 16 h post-infection and plates were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. At that stage about 80% of cells were infected as tested by IFA, and the cell monolayer was still intact. Mock-infected cells treated exactly the same way were used as control. (ii) PEDV whole virus-derived antigen immunocaptured plates: Semi-purified viral antigen (25 \u03bcg/mL) diluted in 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) was coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in nitrocellulose-based 96-well microtiter plates (Millipore, MA, USA). Plates were washed with PBS and blocked with E-RPMI for 1 h at RT and stimulated MNCs of ileum, MLN, and spleen were plated at three tenfold dilutions in duplicate wells starting from 5 \u00d7 105 cells/well. All plates were incubated for 16 h at 39 \u00b0C with 5% CO2, and washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The antibody production was detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled affinity-purified goat anti-pig IgA (Bethyl laboratories, Texas) or IgG (KPL, Maryland) diluted 1:2000 in PBST and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. The color was developed using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and spots were counted using the AID ELISPOT Reader System (Autoimun Diagnostika GmbH Strassberg, Germany).

Though we followed a similar method of growing the virus, but the ELISA antigen was extracted from freeze-thawed viral culture fluid subjected to 20% sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation, probably the cell debris still present in our antigen preparation would have contributed to the observed high background activity in IgG ELISA in plasma, which needs further investigation.",

In our study, in addition to whole virus antigen, both recombinant PEDV S and M protein based IgA and IgG ELISA was used to estimate the levels of antibody in plasma, oral fluid, and fecal samples of sows; and detected high levels of specific IgA response in infected sows\u2019 plasma followed by in oral fluid, but not in fecal samples. This suggests that PEDV specific antibodies in the fecal samples of infected sows disappear early (approximately 1\u20132 months) post-infection; in spite of the presence PEDV specific IgA and IgG ASCs in intestines and lymphoid organs at 6 months post-infection. We also noticed that PEDV specific IgA response in plasma (but not in oral fluid) remained high until 6 months. Furthermore, though we found comparable reactivity of PEDV whole virus derived antigen and S protein for detection of specific IgA antibodies, the antibody levels were twofold less in the S protein based ELISA (ODs at 1:200 dilution).

However, in sows naturally infected with PEDV, we observed higher levels of IgA and IgG ASCs in spleen than in intestines, suggesting that systemic response is equally important and it persists for longer time in infected sows compared to piglets. Suckling and gnotobiotic pigs infected with TGEV and rotavirus, respectively, had higher numbers of specific IgG ASCs compared to IgA ASCs in the intestines [14, 16, 27, 30]. But in our study, in both one and 6 months post PEDV-infected primiparous and multiparous sows, the frequency of specific IgA ASCs were greater than IgG ASCs in the intestines, MLN, and spleen. This suggests the enhanced susceptibility of neonatal pigs to PEDV is responsible for induction of greater levels of IgG ASCs in the intestinal tissues in comparison to that of sows which experience low to mild level of PEDV-infection.",

            "text": "Since PEDV infection is localized to intestinal mucosa, stimulation of systemic immune response especially in piglets is at very low levels [31, 32]. However, our study in sows suggested that systemic response in spleen is predominant over the response in intestines; the differences might be due to time frame of sampling and the age of the animals. Immunologically, the possible reason could be the migration of activated PEDV antigen-bearing dendritic cells to spleen, resulting in activation of na\u00efve B and T cells. Alternatively, the memory lymphocytes from the mucosa- associated lymphoid tissues could migrate to spleen and bone marrow [33]. In summary, PEDV specific IgA and IgG B cells in infected sows were detectable at higher levels in ileum and spleen compared to that in MLN using both ELISPOT (total B cell response) and flow cytometry (detection of frequency of specific IgA and IgG B cell response) assays, with the later assay demonstrating a more robust result compared to the former in detecting antigen and isotype specific B cells. However, detection of antibody isotype specific B cell response with a memory phenotype marker in mucosal tissues will be highly beneficial to determine PEDV vaccine or infection induced memory in pigs.",
