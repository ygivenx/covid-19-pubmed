            "text": "Here we briefly summarize the data collection method and data of Liu et al. [12]. Investigations were conducted on all influenza like illness (ILI) cases identified during the outbreak. Epidemiological, clinical and contact tracing data were collected by interviewing patients and retrieving medical records. Viruses were identified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays followed by sequence analysis. The heamagglutination inhibition tests were used to detect antibodies to both viruses. The outbreak is reported to have taken place within three buildings (two dormitories and one college clinic). No other cases at the college were reported. Buildings 1 and 2 (with a total membership of 235 and 191 persons, respectively) are next to each other and there is restricted access between the two and to the wider community. Forty five ILI cases were reported from 31 August to 10 September and forty (N = 40) had laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection. Three different types of infection were reported: 22 infected with pandemic A/H1N1 virus, 12 infected with seasonal A/H3N2 virus and six co-infected with both influenza A viruses. In their sequences no substantial differences were observed between patients with mixed and single infections in either pandemic A/H1N1 or seasonal A/H3N2 virus. The clinical features were similar for patients with different infections and the six co-infected patients showed no more severe symptoms than the singly infected patients. Contacts between infected people are shown in Fig. 2 of Liu et al. [12] but this only extends to the contact network within one dormitory. The \u2018index\u2019 case with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 infection was a college student whose symptoms first occurred on 31 August, 2 days after his returning to college. Except for the index case, all patients with A/H1N1 infection had not left the campus during the previous week. In contrast, the source of seasonal A/H3N2 virus infection cannot be determined exactly although available data indicate that A/H3N2 virus might have been prevailing in the college when the pandemic H1N1 virus was introduced. Before the isolation of cases and the initiation of prophylaxis among the campus population (5 September 2009), several patients visited the college clinic and the mixing between students of different dormitories was not frequent in comparison to the mixing between students within each dormitory.",

Among the six cases that the index case infects, three patients (i.e., case 2, 5, and 15) are co-infected with both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. It was assumed that seasonal A/H3N2 virus was endemic [12], however, the infectious contacts with A/H3N2 of these three co-infected cases were unknown. Several possible scenarios are possible: cases 2, 5 and 15 were exposed to pandemic A/H1N1 virus when they were still infectious with A/H3N2; cases 2, 5 and 15 were further exposed to seasonal A/H3N2 virus soon after they had acquired pandemic A/H1N1 virus from the index case; the three cases were infected simultaneously with both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses from the index case who was actually co-infected before contact with cases 2, 5 and 15 but was incorrectly typed as a single infection with pandemic A/H1N1 virus. For simplicity, we use all the contact information for cases within building 1, especially the pathways from the index case to the three co-infections, ignoring the possible pathways for transmitting background endemic seasonal A/H3N2 virus.",

            "text": "To measure the interactions between two influenza A viruses, we first estimated the values of infection type-specific reproductive numbers before the initiation of isolation and prophylaxis occurred. Because most transmissions that involve A/H1N1 and co-infections are known, the estimates of the infection type-specific reproductive numbers are stable at R\ne1 = 1.44 and R\neC = 0.67, and the reproductive number of A/H1N1 due to co-infection is R\ne,C1 = 2.01. In contrast, transmissions that involve A/H3N2 were missing and so estimates of their reproductive numbers show some uncertainty: R\ne2 has a mean 0.48 and 95 % confidence interval of [0.45, 0.51], and the reproductive number of A/H3N2 due to co-infection is R\ne,C2 = 1.60 [1.58, 1.62]. Although the estimate of R\ne1 for A/H1N1 is in agreement with the usual estimates [15, 17], that of R\ne2 for A/H3N2 is much smaller than other estimates which range from 1.19 to 1.37 [17]. The likely reason for this difference lies in the fact that pandemic A/H1N1 is a novel virus while A/H3N2 is an endemic seasonal virus in the study region [12] so some pre-existing immunity against A/H3N2 due to the previous infections and/or vaccination reduces its susceptibility and hence its spread. In the presence of co-infection, infectivity of A/H1N1 increases moderately with \u03d5\n1 = 1.4. However, the increased infectivity of A/H3N2 in the presence of co-infection is large: \u03d5\n2 = 3.28 [95 % CI: 3.18\u20143.38] and so co-infection is estimated to contribute greatly to the outbreak. This is not inconsistent with Liu et al. [12]\u2019s observation that \u201cno patients had detectable hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies against pandemic H1N1 virus in their acute-phase samples\u201d. Although the presence of co-infection can increase the infectivity of each component influenza virus, co-infection itself cannot spread successfully because the co-transmissibility measured by R\neC is estimated to be 0.67, which is less than one.",

[12]). If different values of w are chosen, the estimation of transmissibility involved with A/H3N2 virus changes although the results of the overall transmissibility and those involved with A/H1N1 remain nearly the same. With a low value of w (i.e. the mixing between two dormitories become more restrictive), the reproductive number of A/H3N2 due to co-infection (R\ne,C2) decreases while R\ne2 increases; this consequently reduces the value of \u03d5\n2. For example, the estimate of \u03d5\n2 becomes 3.00 [2.92, 3.13] when w =0.1. This is the outcome because without the index case of A/H3N2 infection, the only possible infectors of A/H3N2 cases 11, 12, 13, 14 in building 2 are co-infection cases 2 and 5, which is independent of the limited mixing rate between two dormitories (w). In the situation without limitation in mixing rates between two dormitories (i.e., w = 1.0), the estimate of \u03d5\n2 is 4.57 [4.42, 4.70]. This result implies that in the absence of any unidentified index cases of A/H3N2 infection, co-infection can enhance the transmissibility of each component virus.",

In view of the restrictive mixing between two dormitories, it is likely that there is an unknown index case of A/H3N2 infection within building 2, although it was not reported. An analysis listed in the Additional file 1 shows that such a hidden index case could change the above conclusion: the reproductive number of A/H3N2 due to co-infection (R\ne,C2) might not exceed the reproductive number by its own (R\ne2) and therefore co-infection could not enhance the infectivity of A/H3N2. Jombart et al. [18] have developed a Bayesian method to reconstruct disease outbreaks by combining epidemiological and genomic data. This may allow for the tests of whether co-infection cases in building 1 are the infectors of A/H3N2 cases in building 2 or whether there is a hidden index case of A/H3N2 infection in building 2. Unfortunately, the representative sequences deposited in GenBank by Liu et al. [12] were not complete genome sequences and were not marked with the relevant symptom onset information. Hence they cannot help to distinguish and/or find the potential sources of A/H3N2 infection in the transmission tree. Conditional on the available information, the evidence about how co-infection alters the infectivity of A/H3N2 virus is lacking. Nevertheless, the conclusion about enhanced infectivity of A/H1N1 within co-infection is not affected.",

To apply to such outbreaks as studied here involving two viruses, some assumptions have been strengthened. There must be two index cases that were singly infected with different viruses or one index case that was co-infected with the two viruses. There are more than one transmission processes. In our study example, there are five transmission processes: A/H1N1 to A/H1N1; A/H3N2 to A/H3N2; co-infection to A/H1N1; co-infection to A/H3N2 and co-infection to co-infection. Unfortunately the available data does not provide direct information for all the transmission processes, and it is not directly possible to assess the heterogeneity in generation intervals among transmission processes. In view of the similar estimates for generation intervals of different transmission processes [15], the generation interval distribution has been assumed to be unchanged over different types of infection as well as over the course of the outbreak.",

Our estimates of epidemiological characteristics such as the generation interval and the transmission rate of influenza A virus are well within the ranges estimated by others [15, 17]. Our estimation shows that although co-infection with A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses cannot be sustained by co-transmission, it enhances the single transmission of both viruses.

Due to their relative rareness, co-infection and interactions between viruses within co-infections have not yet attracted the attention they deserve. To our knowledge this is the first analysis that estimates the interactions between influenza A viruses within co-infection. Theoretical modelling illustrates their potential role in generating the recurrent epidemics and alternation of the dominant virus in seasonal influenza [20, 21]. Surely this urges more empirical studies to investigate this important issue of influenza and other infectious diseases caused by multiple strains.",
