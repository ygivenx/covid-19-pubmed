Since then it has become prevalent in many swine-raising countries and it is one of the most important viral causes of diarrhea, resulting in heavy economic losses to the swine industry, mainly in European and Asia\n[4-11]. Although the commercial vaccines are available to prevent and control of disease, damage caused by PEDV infection is serious and continuous.",

It has a genome of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that is approximately 28 kb in length. The spike protein (S, 180\u2013220kDa), membrane protein (M, 27\u201332kDa), envelope protein (E, ~7kDa) and nucleocapsid protein (N, 55\u201358kDa) are the four structural proteins of PEDV\n[12]. The S protein and M protein are localized on the surface of the virion. The M protein of coronavirus is the most abundant component of the viral envelope. In silico analysis has suggested that the M protein consists of a triple-transmembrane segment flanked by a short amino-terminal domain on the exterior of the virion and a long carboxy-tail located inside the virion. The M protein of coronaviruses is indispensable in the assembly process and budding of virions\n[13-15]. The immune reaction to the M protein of coronaviruses plays an important role in the induction of protection and in mediating the course of the disease\n[16,17]. Monoclonal antibodies against the M protein of coronaviruses have virus-neutralizing activity in the presence of complement\n[18]. The M protein of coronavirus can also stimulate the production of alpha-interferon (\u03b1-IFN)\n[19].",

To produce McAb against the M protein, we had tried to express the intact M protein, but this was unsuccessful (data not shown). As a result of unidentified but complex factors, it is very difficult to express the full-length M protein of coronaviruses\n[22,23]. Finally, we chose to express the truncated C-terminus of the M (tM) protein, and the tM protein was expressed in a fusion form either with a 6\u00d7His tag or a GST tag. The results of WB analysis showed that the fusion proteins tM-His6 and GST-tM could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, which indicates that both fusion proteins had good reactivity. In order to obtain more specific McAb, the fusion protein tM-His6 was selected as an immunogen to elicit the formation of antibody. The fusion protein GST-tM was chosen to coat the ELISA plates to screen hybridomas, so that the coating antigen bore a different tag from the immunogen. After cell fusion and three cycles of selection, one McAb, designed 4D4, was chosen because of its specific reactivity with the fusion protein GST-tM as well as the native M protein of the PEDV CH/SHH/06 strain.",

Nine peptides spanning the identified epitope M3 were expressed in the form of GST-fusion peptides. Further experiments revealed that the epitope was in the M12 region (193TGWAFYVR200) of the M protein (Figure\n3). To define more precisely the core epitope, amino acid residues were removed from the carboxy or amino terminals of the peptide M12 one by one to verify the minimal unit of the epitope that could be recognized by McAb 4D4. As demonstrated in Figure\n3, the amino acid residues \u201c195W\u201d and \u201cR200\u201d were essential for reactivity because deletion of either of them destroyed antibody binding. It is therefore reasonable to deduce that the minimal epitope recognized by McAb 4D4 is 195WAFYVR200.",

Therefore, it was possible to distinguish anti-PEDV antibody from anti-TGEV antibody by employing the epitope as antigen.
