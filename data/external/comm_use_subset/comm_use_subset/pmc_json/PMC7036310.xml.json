            "text": "Pig production has been increasing in the world, with animal number growing from 856 241 to 977 021 thousand heads in 2000 and 2013, respectively (FAO, 2015). The production in Cameroon is following the world trend (from 2 440 404 heads in 2010 to 2 896 271 heads in 2012) due to high demand resulting from the growing population. Though the country is the largest pig producer in Central Africa (MINEPIA, 2009), the demand is not satisfied due to a number of constraints including poor technical inputs in the production system (untrained personnel, old, defective, and worn equipment, inappropriate building among other), poor feeding (low standard feed and lack of feed supplement) and poor health (MINEPIA, 2009). Among the disease challenges, African swine fever (ASF) and erysipelas alone are responsible for heavy losses due to outbreaks that occur almost every year in Cameroon (MINEPIA, 2009). Other infectious diseases reported to occur include hog cholera, porcine encephalomyelitis, Aujeszky's disease, enteritis, transmissible gastroenteritis, porcine encephalomyelitis, erysipelas, dysentery, pasteurellosis, tuberculosis and salmonellosis (MINEPIA, 2009). Parasitic diseases (Strongylid parasites, coccidia, Strongyloides ransomi Acaris suum, Metastrongylus sp., Trichuris suis, Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus and so on) (Kouam, Ngueguim & Kantzoura, 2018) are not the least, causing considerable economic losses due to reduced weight gain, litter size, poor growth rates, visceral organ condemnation at slaughter and deaths (Kauffman, 1996;Pitman, 2010;Stewart & Hale, 1988). Thus, one of the important measures to increase pig productivity should be in the area of disease control. Due to the large number of diseases in pigs, implementation of biosecurity measures (BM) in pig production is of paramount importance. For instance, the prevalence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae has been associated with the level of biosecurity at farm level (Austin, Weigek, Hungerford, & Biehl, 1993;Lambert, Arsenault, Polkak, & D\u2019Allaire, 2012). Reversely, several pig diseases (intestinal and miscellaneous diseases) have been successfully controlled through the respect of biosecurity practices in some countries (Wallgren, 2009).",

            "text": "Nowadays, the implementation of BM is regarded as a powerful tool in the control of diseases on the farm; its main advantage is the potential to keep pathogens off the farm and to prevent pathogens from spreading to other farms. Biosecurity can be defined as a set of management practices or measures to prevent introduction and spread of pathogens within and between farms (Fasina, Lazarus, Spencer, Makinde, & Bastos, 2012;Gueye, 2008;Gunn, Heffernan, Hall, McLeod, & Hovi, 2008). In pig production specifically, biosecurity is defined as \u2018the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of introduction and spread of disease agents; it requires the adoption of a set of attitudes and behaviours by people to reduce risk in all activities involving domestic, captive/exotic and wild animals and their products\u2019 (FAO/ OIE/ World bank, 2010). BM are divided into three components: isolation, traffic control and sanitation (Cardona & Kuney, 2001;FAO/ OIE/ World bank, 2010). Isolation can be regarded as measures related to physical barriers (fence, showers or footbath) and distance between farms in order to limit contacts between infected animals and contaminated objects with disease\u2010free farms (FAO, 2008). Traffic control can be considered as the restriction of feedstuff, human, equipment and animal movement onto the farm (FAO, 2008). Sanitation refers to the cleaning and disinfection of animal housing, people material and equipment (Cardona & Kuney, 2001).",

The area lies between longitude 9\u00b049'\u201310\u00b020\u2019 East of the Greenwish meridian and latitude 5\u00b017\u2019\u20136\u00b022\u2019 North of the equator (Figure 1). The region is characterized by a typical climate with two main seasons, the dry season ranging from November to mid\u2010March and the rainy season which prevail from mid\u2010March to October. Temperature ranges between 15\u00b0 and 24\u00b0C (IRAD, 2012). Livestock species include pigs, small ruminants, cattle, cavies and poultry. The Western Highlands are one of the largest pig production areas of the country and one of the foci of ASF outbreak in the country (MINEPIA, 2009;MINEPIA/FAO, 2009).",

            "text": "This study described the general characteristics of pig husbandry in an area within the Western Highlands of Cameroon, one of the largest pig production regions of the country (MINEPIA, 2009). The extensive production system was found to be the most predominant. Our result is similar to previous findings by the Ministry of livestock, fisheries and animal industry (MINEPIA, 2011). This may be partly explained by the family attachment to traditions and secondly by the lack of financial means and adequate training. Most farmers were engaged in both piglets production and fattening (farrow\u2010to\u2010finish) and the least preferred production option was fattening. This could be due to the fact that piglets are readily sold. The crossed breeds were reared by most farmers (72.75%). This percentage (72.75%) is higher than 56.80% reported by Nd\u00e9bi, Kamajou, and Ongla (2009) and could be related to the fact that with time farmers have noticed that the mixed breeds are zoo\u2010technically more efficient than the pure local breeds (heterosis effect). Man power in the study area was essentially made up of family members, confirming the results obtained by other authors (Nd\u00e9bi et al., 2009) in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. This may be explained by the low income which precludes farmers from hiring off\u2010family workers. The insufficient income corroborates with the low herd size (16.08 \u00b1 11.04), the production system and the feedstuff (kitchen waste and concentrate) used in most farms (88.65%). Combining kitchen waste with concentrate is more economical than using concentrate alone. However, since kitchen waste is not heated before supply to animals, the risk of disease transmission (ASF, erysipelas and salmonellosis among others) is increased. Indeed, kitchen waste contains many food remains whose origin and safety are unknown even by farmers themselves because these waste are generally collected from public dustbins. These wastes are likely to carry ASF virus from the remains of a contaminated pig because the virus can survive for months in protein\u2010rich materials (FAO, 2011). The wastes are also likely to carry other viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus and swine influenza viruses), bacteria (Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and parasites (Cryptosporidium spp., coccidia, helminths). Kitchen wastes are serious hazards in pig farming in the country in general because feeding pigs with kitchen waste is a common practice countrywide. Farmers need to be sensitized on the danger of such a practice. The mean farrowing age observed was 8.70 \u00b1 1.33 months, which was lower than 11.67 \u00b1 35 months reported in Douala (Kouamo, Tankou, Zoli, Bahn, & Ngo Ongla, 2015) or 10.90 \u00b1 2 months reported in Garoua (Mopate\u2010Logtene et al., 2009) in Northern Cameroon. The discrepancy is probably due to the difference in the genetic material since the dominant breed in Garoua is the local breed characterized by a lower performance, in contrast to the improved mixed breeds found in the Western Highlands of the country. The mean weaning age (52.39 \u00b1 7.80) was higher than 35 days obtained in Kounden (Center region of Cameroon) (Gweth, 2016) but the discordance should be related to the difference in husbandry conditions, as the rearing of pigs in Kounden was performed in a monitored station under better biosecurity conditions.",

This obviously is against the FAO/OIE/Work Bank (2010) recommendations, which require a minimum distance of 500 m between farms and from a main road (Pritchard, Dennis, & Waddilove, 2005;Vangroenweghe et al., 2009). Farmers are probably unaware of these measures. In addition, there are no established regulations to guide farmers on the basic BM. A fence was present in only 11.83% of farms and all the farms visited did not have a sign board or any physical notice preventing access on farms for visitors and companion animals. These results disagree with the FAO/OIE/Work Bank (2010) recommendations and with other findings in Nigeria where 84.60% of farms were found to be fenced (Maduka, Igbokwe, & Atsanda, 2016). These results may be due to the fact that the majority of farms belong to the extensive management system. Other animal species were found in 91% of farms, which is a serious biosecurity problem since cross transmission of pathogens between different species has been demonstrated (Pensaert, Ottis, Vandeputte, Kaplan, & Bachmann, 1981;Wall et al., 1995). The poor situation is worsened by the fact that the fence was absent around most piggeries, making a contact between pigs and wildlife possible. Some diseases/pathogens that can be transmitted from other animals to pigs or vice versa include: Bordetella spp., avian tuberculosis, Salmonella spp. and avian influenza (Anonymous, 2010;Pensaert et al., 1981;Vangroenweghe et al., 2009) from birds to pigs; classical swine fever (Fritzemeier et al., 2000) and Aujesky's disease (Artois et al., 2002) from wild boar to pigs; Salmonella Typhimurium between pigs, poultry and ruminants (Wall et al., 1995). The all\u2010in/all\u2010out principle was followed by 10.11% of farms only. Though it is one of the most important BM in the sense that all animals of the production round are removed and the piggeries are clean and disinfected before the arrival of a new batch, the adoption rate of this measure was low and in contrast with the FAO/OIE/Work Bank (2010) recommendations. In fact, this principle was shown to break the infectious cycle of pathogens from one production round to another (Clark, Freeman, Scheidt, & Knox, 1991). Similarly, there was a poor implementation of quarantine area (7.69%). This might be explained by the fact that the vast majority of farmers have not been trained in pig farming and in biosecurity practices. Also, only 6.03% of farmers used farm\u2010specific clothes and boots, which is very risky as humans can act as mechanical vectors of disease to pigs. In this case, transmission may occur through leftovers of urine and faeces from infected animals on footwear and clothing as has been proven through experiments for several germs, among which E. coli (Amass et al., 2003) and classical swine fever virus (Ribbens, Dewulf, Koenen, Maes, & Kruif, 2007). A vast majority of farmers (97.16%) kept animals of same age\u2010group in the same unit (piglets, growers and adults separated and kept in different units). This is a good measure that reduces the risk of infections spread. Another good measure is the fact that most employees did not raise pigs at home; this result is probably explained by the fact that most farms (80.10%) had family members as the main work force.",

            "text": "As far as \u2018traffic control\u2019 is concerned, implementation of BM appears to be related to the husbandry system. The low adoption level (13.52%) of the linear flow principle is consistent with the low number of farms under intensive and semi\u2010intensive system (4.33 and 22.45%, respectively). The main advantage of the principle is that the \u2018clean area\u2019 cannot be contaminated by a pathogen from the dirty area, unless rodents and insect control is poor or the clean road is used by unclean and non\u2010disinfected vehicles (Neumann, 2012). The majority of farms assigned a specific employee to a specific piggery. As the number of visitors should be limited on a farm, so also should the number of workers per animal barn be limited. Otherwise, an employee taking care of several buildings can transmit pathogen from one building to another (Kapperud et al., 1993). This result is explained by the fact that most farms are made up of a single animal barn. In a few farms (11.65%), visitors washed their hands before touching an animal; again, this finding is consistent with the low number of farms under semi\u2010intensive and intensive husbandry system where the biosecurity level has been reported to be higher than in extensive system (FAO/OIE/Work Bank, 2010); the fact that only this percentage of farms adopted this measure is a serious biosecurity flaw in the area. In general, production tools and equipment were specific for a piggery, which is in line with the fact that these tools and equipment were exchanged among farms only by a very limited number of farmers. However, the protective effect of these measures was jeopardized by the habit to exchange boars among 31.96% of farms for reproduction purposes. It is well established that introduction of new genetic materials (semen) or animals from different source herds increases the risk of disease introduction into the pig farm (Hege, Zimmermann, Scheidegger, & St\u00e4rk, 2002;Lo Fo Wong, 2004;Pritchard et al., 2005). Exchange of animals among farms is one of the most rapid ways for disease dissemination because an animal may apparently look healthy while it is a chronic, asymptomatic carrier of pathogens. Once introduced into a farm, such an animal becomes the transmission source of diseases to na\u00efve animals. For instance, pigs with the chronic form of ASF can live several months (FAO, 2011); as long as they live, they will continue to be a hazard for pig farms because the virus is likely to be shed via their secretions and excretions. Therefore, the widespread habit of boars exchange observed among farmers is of major concern. The recurrent outbreaks of the so\u2010called \u2018red diseases\u2019 (this expression is used in Cameroon to designate these common diseases of pigs that clinically exhibit skin red colour) in Cameroon might be maintained through this devastating practice. Exchange of boars without prior assurance about the disease\u2010free status of both the boars and the sows should be strongly avoided. An alternative solution for reproduction could be the vulgarization of the artificial insemination technique, which is already practiced on some limited number of farms in the country.",

Footbaths were available in only 29.90% of farms, which can be explained by the small number of farms under semi\u2010intensive and intensive system. Footbath is essential for disinfection of footwear and should be renewed on a regular basis. This level is low and in disagreement with the findings (58.00%) obtained by Anne, Isabelle, and Mai (2010). Though footbaths appear of little effectiveness against ASF due to the fact that the boots are not the only wears that may carry virus, they may reduce the risk of transmission if they are correctly used. Use of disinfectant and daily cleaning was implemented in the large majority of farms, suggesting that most farmers understand the need to keep the farms cleaned and disease\u2010free. Also, most producers had the slurry draining system functional on their farm confirming their good disposition to protect their farms from diseases. The cleanout was adopted only in 18.14% of farms. This poor adoption level should be due to the fact that most farms under extensive system do not follow the all\u2010in all\u2010out principle, such that animals are always present on the farm.",

The low biosecurity level is probably related to the fact that the majority of farms operated under extensive system. Our finding is in accordance with the FAO/OIE/Work Bank (2010) observations. Considering the three components of biosecurity, the highest percentage of farms with an adoption rate of BM equal or more than 75.00% was not greater than 10.00%, with the \u2018traffic control\u2019 component enjoying the first position (9.70%), followed by the \u2018isolation\u2019 (4.70%) component and finally the \u2018sanitation\u2019 component occupying the last position (2.97%). This low level of biosecurity observed for all the components suggests that farmers do not have any understanding of biosecurity principles in pig farming, and that steps (training and sensitization) should be taken to fill the gap.",

The low implementation level of BM suggests that farmers still have a long way to go and that government officials should handle the issue of biosecurity in pig farming sectors very seriously. With these alarming results, it is not surprising that ASF has become endemic in pig production areas of the country and is still causing a tremendous harm to the pig industry. Parasitic diseases as well as diarrhoea have also become an important health constraint in pig production probably as a result of the very poor biosecurity level on the farms. The most important measures of concern and to improve are; not feeding kitchen waste to pigs; keeping other livestock species away from pigs; fencing pig barns; keeping newly arrived animals in quarantine, not exchanging boars; not selling sick animals. Other countries with similar husbandry systems might probably face the same flaw in biosecurity practices. Future works will focus on the relationship between biosecurity and production performance, incidence of different diseases and culling rates in the area.",
