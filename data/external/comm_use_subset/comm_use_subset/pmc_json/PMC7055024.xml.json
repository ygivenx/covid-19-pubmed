BRD causes substantial economic losses for the cattle industry, and can also be seen as an animal welfare issue [4]. Several studies have demonstrated the negative economic impact of increased mortality, treatment costs, and reduced growth caused by BRD [5\u20137]. Moreover, high morbidity rates lead to increased use of antibiotics, which is commonly associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance [8]. Together with veal calf operating units in Europe, calf rearing operations in Finland consume reasonably high levels of antibiotics [2, 9, 10]. A recent study published in the Netherlands showed that antimicrobial consumption rates in veal calf farms was several times higher compared with pig and broiler farms [9]. Public concern of animal welfare and emergence of antibiotic resistance puts pressure on the industry to find new preventive methods for improving animal health, and thus reduce the use of antibiotics in the beef production chain [11].",

These bull calves are commonly either pure dairy breeds or dairy-beef crosses. They are transported to separate rearing units at 10\u201330 days of age. Unlike veal calf production in central Europe and North America, calves in Finland are not slaughtered until the age of 18\u201320 months. Approximately two thirds of dairy bull calves are first transported to specialized calf rearing units where they are reared for 4\u20136 months before transportation to the specialized finishing farms. The remaining calves are either transported to the finishing farms directly after weaning, or to the integrated beef production farms specialized for rearing unweaned calves to the slaughter age.

            "text": "Unlike in many other countries, vaccinations against BRD are not commonly used in Finland. The growing size of calf rearing units and rising incidence of BRD has forced us to introduce new preventive methods. Vaccinating calves more frequently against common respiratory pathogens in the future could be one part of the solution. Since morbidity and mortality rates are usually highest in the first weeks after arrival to the calf rearing units [3, 15] and maternal antibodies are known to have an inhibitory effect on parenterally administered vaccinations [16, 17], developing an effective vaccination program for young calves has been problematic. This blocking effect has increased the interest in introducing intranasally administrable vaccinations. Hill and others [18] showed that 3\u20138 day old Holstein calves are capable of developing mucosal immune response after intranasal vaccination, even when maternal antibodies are present. Other studies of intranasal vaccinations have also shown promising results in young calves (3\u201314 days old) vaccinated against common respiratory pathogens [19\u201321]. The short duration of immunity after one dose of intranasal vaccination may set a requirement for subsequent booster vaccines [19, 22]. Even though intranasal vaccinations have not reduced the incidence of BRD in some studies, pathological changes in lungs have been reduced [22, 23]. As calves are transported to the rearing unit from numerous farms, it would be more achievable to start vaccinating calves at the time of arrival to the rearing unit, even though the best vaccine effect would require vaccination already before transportation. Despite the increased interest in intranasal vaccinations, very few clinical trials are available to prove their efficacy in field conditions.",

This difference was not recorded in calves that arrived when they were younger than 17 days. In our study, all the vaccinated calves were vaccinated one to three days after arrival. This finding suggests that younger calves are not capable of responding to the vaccination as effectively as older calves. Further studies are needed to determine if this is a result of the younger calves having an immature immune system, or inhibitory effects of maternal antibodies. Vaccination also showed a trend towards increasing daily gain during the milk-feeding period independent of age at the time of arrival.

The current study was conducted in a calf rearing unit, and it differed from the challenge studies in several ways. In our study, maternal antibody levels in calf serum displayed variation at the time of vaccination, and calves were naturally exposed to a wide range of pathogens. We knew from earlier studies and reports that bovine respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza-3 virus are rather common pathogens in Finnish cattle, thus we were quite confident that these pathogens would be present in the large rearing unit used in our study [12, 14, 27]. Here, we studied the efficacy of the vaccination under field conditions, which have probably also led to BRD cases caused by pathogens other than those included in the vaccine. The outcomes examined in our study were daily gain before weaning, daily gain during the complete study period, BRD diagnosis during the second clinical examination (at the time of weaning), number of antimicrobial treatments for BRD, and mortality during the study period.",

In practice, this is difficult to implement because the calves often have multiple origins, and dairy farmers are rarely motivated to vaccinate calves that are shortly leaving the farms. A more feasible practice could be to vaccinate calves at the time of arrival to the calf rearing unit (or immediately after), as we did in our study. We were aware that this may lead to decreased efficacy because the calves might get infected already before the vaccination or before the immunity has been successfully developed. According to our knowledge, there are no published efficacy studies of a similar intranasal vaccination protocol in the prevention of BRD in commercial calf rearing units. Nevertheless, the practice is commonly used in some European countries [28].",

Bigger calves and those with higher growth potential are probably more likely to be transported despite the sickness, whereas small, older, and lower growth potential calves might be more readily excluded.

A similar effect might explain why the number of treatments against BRD was not reduced in the current study, even though the diagnosed BRD cases in the second clinical examination were reduced. Thompson and others [6] showed the association between lung lesions and decreased daily gain in slaughtered feedlot cattle. In the same study, they also demonstrated the existence of subclinical BRD by showing that lung lesions were presented in 38.5% of the animals never treated for BRD.

A similar association between low serum IgG levels and higher morbidity has also been presented in previous studies [31, 32]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studied reference values for serum IgG levels for calves 2\u20134 weeks old. For two day old calves, 10 mg/ml is commonly used as the minimum level for successful passive transfer, but earlier studies have shown that the amount of IgG in serum decreases slowly after birth, with a half-life of 28.5 days [33]. In the current study, 44.1% of the calves with low serum IgG (< 10 mg/ml on arrival; mean age 17 days) were treated at least once against BRD, compared with 34.2% of the calves with high serum IgG (> 10 mg/ml at arrival, mean age 17 days). This supports earlier findings that have demonstrated how successful passive transfer of maternal antibodies is important for the health of the calf [34]. Of the arriving calves, 23.3% had serum SAA higher than the reference value < 178 mg/ml suggested by Sepp\u00e4-Lassila and colleagues [24]. Calves with higher serum SAA concentration gained weight slower than calves with lower concentrations, as also reported in earlier studies [2]. Elevated concentrations of serum SAA may be normal in calves younger than two weeks old, or they may be a reflection of some existing inflammation already present at the time of arrival [24].

The study period started on the day of first clinical examination and lasted until the day when calves were transported to the finishing unit (average 154.5 days, SD 4.7). Daily gain was calculated during the period from arrival to weaning (milk-feeding period), and again from arrival to transportation to finishing unit (complete study period). Medications were recorded for the whole study period. Blood samples were analyzed to detect possible low serum IgG levels and high SAA levels at the time of enrolment. Normal operation cycle of the calf rearing unit remained throughout the study period and after study calves were transported to the feedlot for finishing cattle as usual. None of the calves were euthanized because of the study.

The unit was operated as an all-in all-out system, such that all six milk-feeding compartments were emptied, washed and disinfected prior to every arrival of new calves. The unit was confirmed to be free of Mycoplasma bovis. A milk replacer (Primo powermix, Suomen Rehu Oy, Finland) was dispensed by an automatic milk-feeding system (in total 33 kg/calf during the milk-feeding period), and all the calves had free entry to silage and concentrates (Primo Kasvatus 1, Suomen Rehu Oy, Finland). Each compartment contained one large pen with a solid floor feeding area and peat/straw bedding on the resting area. All compartments were insulated and had separate ventilation systems based on automatic exhaust fans. After 43 days of milk-feeding, calves were gradually weaned and then merged with the calves from the other compartments into one larger uninsulated compartment. Unlimited mixed feed was supplemented with 2 kg of grated barley/rapeseed mixture was offered to all calves daily from three weeks after weaning until the end of the study period (total concentrate percent around 55).",

Because of the interaction detected between the calf age at arrival and vaccination (Fig. 1), two separate models were used to evaluate the association between vaccination and daily gain during the complete study period. One model was used for calves 17 days or older at the time of arrival, and another model for calves younger than 17 days. Additionally, three logistic mixed regression models were used to study the association between intranasal vaccination and BRD diagnosis at the second clinical examination (0/1), treated for BRD during the study period (0/1), and death of the calf before transportation to the finishing unit (0/1). The transportation batch was used as a random factor in all models. In addition to vaccination status (vaccinated or unvaccinated), we studied several potential explanatory covariates. Nominal variables included sex (male, female) and breed of the calves (Ayrshire, Holstein, Dairy-beef crosses) and BRD diagnosis at the first clinical examination (0/1). Continuous variables included age and weight of the calves at arrival, clinical score, and serum IgG and SAA concentration at the time of the first clinical examination. Age at arrival and SAA concentration were log-transformed to achieve normal distribution (and better suitability for the models). The number of antimicrobial treatments per calf was tested in models with outcome variables such as daily gain and mortality to control the possible confounding effect on the outcomes. Moreover, the confounding effect of sex and breed was tested in all models if that variable was not already included in the model (e.g. in the case of univariate analyses). A change greater than 20% in variable coefficients or odds ratios was defined as confounding. All the biologically meaningful two-way interactions between vaccination and fixed factors were tested. All statistical analyses were performed in Stata/MP 14.1 for Windows (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA).",
