It was first identified in USA in 1978 and was found later to have spread worldwide in domestic and wild canine populations. CPV-2 is a small non-enveloped, singe-stranded DNA virus (5.2 Kb) which is a member of the genus Parvovirus of the family Parvoviridae. The CPV genome is composed of two major ORFs, one encoding the two non-structural proteins [NS1 and NS2] and the other encoding the two capsid proteins [VP1 and VP2] [1]. There is also a third protein, VP3 which is produced by proteolytic processing of VP2.",

However, FPV infects cats, mink and raccoons, but not dogs, whereas CPV-2 infects dogs and other Canidae, but not cats. A few amino acid differences between CPV and FPV determine the specificity of these viruses [2]. After the CPV-2 initial appearance (during 1978\u20131981), two new antigenic variants, named CPV-2a and CPV-2b, were characterized [3-5]. The antigenic types CPV-2a and CPV-2b differ from the original CPV-2 in at least five or six amino acids/residues of the VP2 capsid protein (genomic positions 3045, 3685, 3699, 4062 and 4449) [6,7]. Canine parvovirus type 2a/2b having mutation at 297 residue (Ser\u2192Ala) is designated as new CPV-2a/2b [8,9], residue 297 is located in a minor antigenic site close to epitope B and substitutions at this position may be responsible for changes in antigenicity of CPV variants [10]. Another antigenic variant having an amino acid substitution 426-Asp\u2192Glu was reported for the first time in Italy [11] and had been reported from other countries [1,12-17], and this variant is currently named as CPV-2c.",

            "text": "The natural adaptation of a virus to a new host is a very rare event, suggesting that there are high barriers that prevent viruses from gaining the ability to infect and spread naturally in hosts to which they are not adapted. In this study, the novel point mutation virus is most likely not a panda-adapted virus spreading among pandas, but more likely a spill-over from dogs. Because host adaptation involved complex interactions among both surface-exposed and buried capsid mutations that together altered cell infection and immune escape properties of the viruses [33]. In this study, the virus VP2 gene coding change at nt 3894 (VP2 residue 370, Gln\u2192Arg) was interesting because it has not been detected previously in any other strains. We speculated that the mutation has two aspect functions. On the one hand, residue 370 was close to residues 375 and 377, it has indicated that residues 375 and 377 are associated with the ability of CPV to hemagglutinate or alter pH dependence of hemagglutination [34], On the other hand, residue 370 was adjacent to residue 379 and 384, while the 379 and 384 residue affects canine transferrin receptor (TfR) binding to determined the canine host range [35]. So, we made the inferences that R370 might be involved in a required conformational change, or it might mediate an effect on receptor binding through the neighboring residues, and is likely to have had an effect on the parvovirus host range. This observation suggests that the glutamine to arginine mutation may also affect host DNA\u00b1protein interaction. As is the case for wild animal, this mutation is not selected for the population, but may have arisen independently from various backgrounds.",
