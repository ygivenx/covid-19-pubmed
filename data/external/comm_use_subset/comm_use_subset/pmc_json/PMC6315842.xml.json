            "text": "The One Health concept which focuses on the connections between the health of humans, animals and the environment, dates back to the ancient world and was compatible with the dominating scientific philosophy of the time, the theory of humours [1]. The interdependency of public health and clean environment was identified as early as Hippocrates (460 BCE\u2013367 BCE) in Airs, Waters and Places, which argued that geographical conditions and climate influence health [2,3]. Many of us are convinced that the Zoobiquity approach is innovative, but as early as 350 BC, Aristoteles (384 BCE\u2013322 BCE) in Historia Animalium presents the first documented approach to comparative medicine [4]. He diversified humans from animals through their possession of a rational soul. However, his intuition led him to relate animals to humans by documenting differences and similarities in the form, function and purpose of their parts. On this basis, he created a taxonomic system. Even Galen of Pergamum (129 CE\u20132216/217 CE), following Aristotele, wrote extensively about his numerous observations and experiments of animals [5].",

Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654 CE\u20131720 CE), a pioneering epidemiologist, physician and veterinarian, was the author of papers in which he identified the role the environment plays in the spread of diseases both to human and to animals [9]. The seventeenth and eighteen century movements provided great insight and proved ancient Greek theories were correct in principle by bringing humans and animals into even greater proximity.",

His investigations proved the key role of the environment in human and animal health and diseases. D\u2019Azyr correlated human and animal diseases with climatic and geographical conditions. He did not perceive any dividing line between human and animal medicine [10]. The founding of the first veterinary school in Lyon, France, by Claude Bourgelat (1712\u20131779) established formal education in animal health and its interaction with human health in Europe. The subsequent work of Louis-Ren\u00e9 Villerm\u00e9 (1782\u20131863) and Alexandre Parent-Duchatelet (1790\u20131835), also in France, led to the development of the veterinary specialty field of public hygiene [11]. It was a little later that the German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1827\u20131902) coined the term \u2018zoonosis\u2019. He insisted that health in humans and animals differed only in detail and not in kind. He recognized that environmental factors were key determinants of health outcomes. For example, his indications for ending a persistent epidemic of typhus, which he himself had investigated, was to provide the affected region with freedom, improved roads and good schools [12].",

An ever-expanding number of scientific discoveries, \u201cmilestones of understanding\u201d were developed in animal models and then applied to humans.

The contribution and inter-dependency of ecosystem health to the health of humans and animals received full recognition in early 2000, when One Health became the dominating approach to emerging threats related to avian and pandemic influenza. This likely triggered the popularity of the One-health concept beyond the limited scientific community, to the point that it was a well-represented issue in the agenda of the International Ministerial Conference on Avian and pandemic influenza in 2008 in Sharm El Sheikh. Since then, successful projects and growing attention have been focusing on the emergence of potentially zoonotic pathogens from wildlife and the ecosystem. Over the past couple of decades, outbreaks of avian influenza, West Nile, Ebola, MERS CoV and many others have urged funding agencies and international organizations to include wildlife in their studies, and even beyond that, some internationally funded projects are targeted to carry out surveillance focused on wildlife [18].",
