            "text": "Genetic codes and potential secondary structures defined by local RNA sequences constitute the two layers of information embedded within the primary mRNA sequences of an open reading-frame (ORF). The secondary structures in mRNA are unwound by an intrinsic duplex-unwinding activity of ribosome during translation [1,2], allowing exposure of the buried genetic codes for decoding in the ribosomal A-site, while refolding co-translationally after leaving the ribosome. As an mRNA is translated by multiple ribosomes, the unwinding and refolding cycles of secondary structures repeat for an active mRNA under translation. However, specific mRNA structures could resist ribosomal unwinding and trigger backward slippage (toward the 5\u2019-direction of mRNA) of the ribosome by one nucleotide within a slippery sequence to stimulate translational reading-frame switch toward the \u22121 frame. An in-frame XXXYYYZ slippery sequence as well as an optimally placed (5\u20138 nucleotides) downstream stimulator pseudoknot [3] or hairpin [4] is required for efficient \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) with X and Y each representing an identical nucleotide. By positioning A- and P-site tRNAs over the slippery sequence while keeping Watson-Crick base-pairing identities of the codon-anticodon interactions at the first two positions of each codon unchanged in 0- and \u22121 frames, this configuration helps increase probability to slip the ribosome one nucleotide in the 5\u2019 direction [5,6]. By contrast, specific mRNA signals can program a ribosome to slip forward (toward the 3\u2019-direction) by a single nucleotide for +1 frameshifting [7,8,9]. The well-documented +1 frameshifting in the Ty1 retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involves a hepta-nucleotide sequence (CUUAGGC), and is caused by ribosome pausing at the AGG codon due to low expression levels of AGG decoding tRNA while being decoded within ribosomal A-site [10]. Differences in cis-element requirement between +1 and \u22121 frameshifting suggest that distinct mechanisms are responsible for these two frameshifting pathways, although disruption of codon-anticodon interactions between peptidyl-tRNA and mRNA during translocation step of translation elongation has been proposed to play an initiation role for frameshifting [11].",

            "text": "Both +1 and \u22121 PRFs have been characterized in prokaryotic gene expression regulation [7,8,9]. +1 PRF is adopted by the prfB gene of E. coli. to encode one of the translation termination proteins, release factor 2 (RF2), in a regulatory feedback loop. When the UGA recognizing RF2 is insufficient in a cell, a translating ribosome pauses at the stop codon within the CUUUGA sequence located in the N-terminal coding region of prfB. To escape from this trap, the paused ribosome slips one nucleotide forward to continue translation in +1 frame to complete the synthesis of full-length RF2. This results in supply of mature RF2 to terminate translation at the frameshifting site UGA codon to prevent synthesis of more RF2. By contrast, the dnaX gene of E. coli. produces the \u03b3 subunit of DNA polymerase III by \u22121 PRF via an AAAAAAG slippery sequence (A6G) and a downstream RNA hairpin. [12]. Single-molecule fluorescence analysis tracking dye-labeled ribosome movement along mRNA suggested that the downstream dnaX hairpin impeded translocation while stimulating \u22121 frameshifting at AAG codon during the incoming accommodation step [13]. However, a kinetic analysis of a downstream \u22121 PRF pseudoknot in an in vitro 70S translation system argued that the frameshifting event occurred in the post-translocation step after peptide bond formation between the aminoacyl-tRNA and peptidyl-tRNA that sit at the XXY and YYZ codons, respectively [14]. Nevertheless, these works help establishing 70S ribosome as an ideal platform for mechanical analysis of frameshifting regulation.",

            "text": "In addition to specific downstream structures, an internal Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD) 8 to 11 nucleotides upstream of the slippery site was shown to act as a \u22121 PRF stimulator [12]. Furthermore, E-site juxtaposing internal SD upstream of the CUUUGA +1 frameshifting site can promote +1 frameshifting [15], whereas deletion analysis indicated that E-site juxtaposing upstream internal SD can downregulate \u22121 PRF stimulated by a downstream dnaX hairpin [12]. Although internal SD \u25cf anti-SD interaction has been suggested to be an elongation pausing element for 70S ribosome [16], mechanisms underlining the opposing effects in +1 and \u22121 frameshifting regulation by E-site juxtaposing upstream internal SD remain unclear. Recently, it was found that a potential RNA hairpin upstream of XXXYYYZ \u22121 frameshifting site can down-regulate mammalian \u22121 PRF as well as stimulate AGG codon mediated +1 frameshifting in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [17,18]. The frameshifting regulation activities were shown to be positively correlated with the predicted stability of the upstream hairpins. Given the unfolding/refolding cycles of a translating mRNA, it suggests the involvement of a co-translationally refolded upstream hairpin in frameshifting regulation when the ribosome moves into a downstream frameshifting site. These findings of unexpected frameshifting regulation by upstream structures are in contrast to the well-known role of downstream RNA structures in stimulation of eukaryotic \u22121 PRF [3,4] and implicate a link between the mechanisms of +1 and \u22121 frameshifting regulation by mRNA structures flanking frameshifting sites. However, differences of sequence compositions between the +1 and \u22121 frameshifting sites hamper further analysis. Intriguingly, a trans-formed duplex mediated by an antisense DNA and the sequence upstream of frameshifting site can replace the cis-acting hairpin to attenuate \u22121 PRF [19]. In addition to suggesting that formation of an upstream duplex juxtaposing frameshifting sequences is the determinant for frameshifting regulation, this result is reminiscent of the duplex formed between the internal SD sequence and 16S rRNA in prokaryotic frameshifting regulation [12,15] although the components forming the two duplexes are different. Therefore, a direct comparison of frameshifting regulation activities between upstream hairpins and internal SD mediated duplexes in 70S ribosome could shed light to help resolving the roles of mRNA structures flanking the ribosomal mRNA-binding channel in frameshifting regulation.",

In addition to showing that a stable upstream hairpin is a functional mimicry of upstream internal SD in both +1 and \u22121 frameshifting regulations, we discovered a downstream structure-mediated non-canonical \u22121 frameshifting under the +1 frameshift-prone CUUUGA frameshifting site in the absence of RF2. Importantly, by using this frameshifting site to minimize the effects of sequence composition differences in P-site codon-anticodon interactions, we are able to demonstrate that a downstream structure can stimulate \u22121 frameshifting and attenuate +1 frameshifting, which are opposite to the frameshifting regulation activities of the upstream refolding hairpin. These findings indicate that stable structures flanking the two ends of mRNA-binding channel within an elongating ribosome play opposite roles in regulation of bidirectional reading-frame switch. In addition to providing a framework for further mechanism analysis, these results can be used to explain non-canonical frameshifting events observed in disease-related genes containing long expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions.",

To examine the frameshifting regulation activity of upstream refolding hairpins in 70S ribosome, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and Renilla luciferase fusion protein coding construct (GST-Rluc) was designed to serve as the in vitro frameshifting reporter. The GST open reading frame (ORF) was fixed in 0 frame, while the downstream Rluc ORF was fused out of frame such that it could only be accurately translated upon frameshifting through insertion of translational frameshifting signals between GST and Rluc ORFs (Figure S1A). Premature stop codons for out of frame translation were also inserted in the N-terminal region of Rluc ORF (Figure S1A). They were used to prevent radioactivity-based frameshifting efficiency calculation bias caused by ribosome drop-off effect [22] during translation of long frameshifted polypeptides. In vitro \u22121 and +1 PRF activities using different amounts of reporter mRNA as translation templates in cell-free lysates of E. coli. (Figures S1B,C and S2A) were examined to determine the optimal amount of mRNA (200 ng) required for frameshifting assay. The \u22121 PRF efficiencies induced by a downstream dnaX hairpin in the presence of upstream internal SD mediated duplexes with different spacings toward the frameshifting site (Figure S1B,D) were similar to those reported in vivo [12], indicating that the experimental platform can faithfully reproduce this \u22121 PRF model system.",

A CGC sequence was used as the E-site codon for the CUUUGA frameshifting site to avoid E-site invasion [24] that could mask the +1 frameshifting stimulation activities of upstream duplexes. The effects of upstream internal SD-mediated duplexes and hairpins (Figure 2A) on \u22121 and +1 PRF efficiencies were analyzed. An RNA hairpin of a GC base-pair rich 12 base-pairs stem capped by UGCG loop sequence (H1) with a predicted stable hairpin conformation was used for comparison (Figure 2A). We found that the SD-ASD duplex attenuated activity of \u22121 PRF stimulated by mPK the most (Figure 2B,C), and was also the most potent stimulator of +1 PRF for the CUUUGA frameshifting site in the absence of RF2 (Figure 2D,E). By contrast, RNA hairpins regulated +1 and \u22121 frameshifting efficiencies to a lesser extent. However, the stable upstream hairpin, H1 reduced \u22121 PRF to a similar extent as that of internal SD and possessed about 60% of the +1 frameshifting activity that can be stimulated by the internal SD (Figure 2D,E). By contrast, a destabilization mutant of H1 with reduced stability through Watson-Crick base-pairing disruption and bulge insertion (H2) possessed much lower \u22121 PRF attenuation and +1 PRF stimulation activities compared with those of H1. These results are consistent with the positive correlation between frameshifting regulation activity and hairpin stability observed before [18]. Furthermore, the upstream hairpin-dependent +1 frameshifting occurred only in the absence of RF2 (Figure S2B). Together with previous analysis in eukaryotic systems [19], these results indicate that stable upstream refolding hairpins are functional elements capable of regulating frameshifting in both 70S and 80S ribosomes.",

It also raises the question of whether a downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator also plays an opposite role in \u22121 and +1 frameshifting regulation. This means that a downstream \u22121 PRF stimulator may serve as a +1 PRF attenuator. To test this hypothesis, mPK was placed downstream of the +1 frameshift-prone CUUUGA sequence (Figure 3A) to examine its effect on +1 frameshifting in the absence of RF2. A mutant of mPK with stem1 disrupted (MT) was used as the negative control for measuring intact +1 frameshifting activity. Interestingly, +1 frameshifting activity decreased when the downstream structure was replaced from MT to mPK (Figure 3B,C). This result is consistent with +1 frameshifting attenuation by a downstream mPK. Thus, the mPK downstream of mRNA-binding channel of an elongating ribosome plays reverse regulatory roles in +1 and \u22121 frameshifting regulations.",

Sequence analysis implicated that the extra translation product could arise from a \u22121 frameshifting event although there was no XXXYYYZ consensus slippery sequence of \u22121 PRF. Consistently, mutating the potential \u22121 frame stop codon moved the extra translation product to a higher region of the gel, corresponding to translation termination at the next \u22121 frame stop codon (\u201cshift\u201d in Figure 3B). Together, these results suggest that a non-canonical \u22121 frameshifting may have occurred in addition to +1 frameshifting. Finally, faint extra bands with low mobility in the gel appeared upon longer image exposure and disappeared upon treatment of the translation reaction with RNase before gel-loading (Figure S3). Given that the translated protein products were 35S-methionine labelled, the senstivity to RNase treatment suggested that the low mobility bands belonged to colvant linkage adducts between proteins and RNAs, and most probably a peptidyl-tRNA intermediate during translation in the absence of RF2.",

The nucleotide sequence encoding the FLAG amino acid sequence was inserted upstream of the corresponding frameshifting site in the 0 frame of GST-Rluc fusion ORF so that translation products, including shifted and non-shifted ones all contain the FLAG fragment. After translation, these FLAG-tagged translation products were immuno-precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody, purified by protein G conjugated bead, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S4B\u2013E). Comparison of the frameshifting products of the construct before and after immunoprecipitation with those of the FLAG-less frameshifting reporter indicated that frameshifting efficiency remained similar between the two constructs (Figure 3 and Figure S4D). Attempts of LC-MS/MS analysis by thrombin treatment to remove GST from the \u22121 frameshifted C-terminal peptide were not successful (data not shown). Instead, in-gel trypsin digestion was performed to generate peptide fragments for LC-MS/MS characterization. Analysis of liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) data of peptide fragments derived from the unusual translation product identified a 9 amino acid tryptic peptide fragment (LLITGVSVR) and this was further validated using a chemically synthesized peptide standard (Figure 4A,B). This result supports a frameshifting event occurring at the CUUUGA sequence with a UGA to UUG shift (encoding the second leucine after formation of the first leucine by decoding the 0 frame CUU), followed by continued translation extension in the \u22121 frame (Figure 4C and Figure S4F).",

Interestingly, replacing E-site sequence from CGC to CGU dramatically diminished the \u22121 frameshifting product with the restoration of +1 frame product (compare lanes 4 and 5 in Figure 5A), whereas replacement from CGC to UGC did not lead to a diminished \u22121 frameshifting product (compare lanes 3 and 5 in Figure 5A). Further mutating UGC to UAC to reduce codon-anticodon stability did not alter the distribution of frameshifting patterns (lanes 1 and 3 in Figure 5A), whereas mutating UGC to UGG almost abolished the \u22121 frameshifting product (lane 2 in Figure 5A). Thus, neither stability of E-site codon-anticodon pairing nor E site invasion is the main cause of the dramatic switch in frameshifting pathways. Although the diminished \u22121 frameshifting can be explained by \u22121 PRF efficiency modulation by E-site sequence composition [26,27], we noticed that significant \u22121 frameshifting seems to require the third position of the E-site codon to be a C nucleotide, which also occurs at the first position of the P-site codon. Furthermore, dramatic \u22121 frameshifting reduction by converting CGC CUU to CGU CUU can be reversed by further mutating the P-site sequence from CUU to UCU (lanes 4\u20136 in Figure 5A), resulting in an identical U bridging the E- and P- sites. Together, these data indicate that an identical nucleotide in the two positions bridging 0 frame E- and P- sites is enough to facilitate \u22121 frameshifting with a downstream structure in the absence of RF2, and is consistent with the repairing of 0 frame peptidyl-tRNA to an identical nucleotide in the first position of the \u22121 frame codon to pave the way for \u22121 frame switching.",

Given that the CUU codon in the CUUUGA frameshifting site represents the last coding amino acid in the 0 frame, positioning the CUU codon into the A-site for formation of the final peptide bond results in a spacing of 8 nucleotides in length toward downstream mPK (Figure 3A). However, the absence of RF2 being required for frameshifting to occur indicates that frameshifting occurs after the UGA codon enters the ribosomal A-site, resulting in a spacing of 5 nucleotides in length toward mPK. We reasoned that if the first model can explain observed \u22121 frameshifting, deleting the spacer length by 2 nucleotides should still be \u22121 frameshifting competent (Figure 6A). By contrast, the second model predicted such a deletion mutant should be frameshifting incompetent because spacing toward the pseudoknot becomes non-optimal (3 nucleotides in length). The results showed that the resulted construct sp3 lost \u22121 frameshifting activity (Figure 6B), indicating that mPK stimulates \u22121 frameshifting with a five-nucleotides spacing downstream of the ribosomal A- site sitting UGA stop codon. Combined with \u22121 frameshifting product characterization and E-site sequence mutagenesis results, they suggest that the non-canonical \u22121 frameshifting occurs via a single slippage of peptidyl-tRNA in 5\u2019 direction through two possible pathways with UGA stop codon sitting at the ribosomal A-site (Figure 6C). In pathway A, the 0-frame peptidyl-tRNA moves from CUU to \u22121 frame CCU, allowing the \u22121 frame UUG codon for decoding in the A-site. By contrast, an incoming UUG decoding charged tRNA could sample the available reading-frames in the empty A-site and is paved by the two identical nucleotides bridging E- and P-sites to accept the movement of peptidyl-tRNA toward the \u22121 frame, and resulting in \u22121 frame decoding in the A-site.",

However, +1 frameshifting efficiency was reduced significantly by the downstream mPK (from 51.8% to 38.8%) in a UAUCUUUGA construct that favors +1 frameshifting but disfavors \u22121 frameshifting (Figure 7A,B). Therefore, the main cause of the observed +1 frameshifting reductions is not \u22121 frameshifting pathway competition, indicating direct counteraction to +1 frameshifting by the downstream mPK. To see if this property is also applicable to \u22121 frameshifting attenuation by an upstream hairpin, we constructed an H1 hairpin upstream of the A6G \u22121 frameshifting site. We did not detect +1 frameshifting activity (lane 2 in Figure 7C) although H1 did attenuate \u22121 PRF efficiently (lane 1 in Figure 7C). Taken together, these results indicate that the existence of a stable mRNA hairpin at either end of the mRNA-binding channel of an elongation ribosome counteracts frameshifting stimulated by its counterpart at the other end of the channel.",

The CUUUGA sequence was weakly frameshifting-prone without the presence of a stable flanking structure (with the destabilized 9G10A and G34C mutants) (lane 1 in Figure 8B), while +1 frameshifting activity increased in the presence of a stable upstream hairpin (H1-WT) (lane 2). By contrast, a downstream mPK strongly stimulated \u22121 frameshifting (lane 3). Similar to that of Figure S3, an extra faint RNase-sensitive band with low mobility appeared but disappeared upon RNase treatment (Figure S5). The co-existence of this RNase-sensitive band with the \u22121 frameshifting product and its disappearance in the presence of RF2 implicated that it is related to \u22121 frameshifting and its identity awaits further characterization in the future. Finally, both +1 and \u22121 frameshifting products were significantly reduced in the presence of both the stable upstream H1 hairpin and the downstream mPK (lane 4).

Such hungry codon-mediated frameshifting has also been proposed to be responsible for observed \u22121 frameshifting of Huntingtin in Huntington\u2019s disease due to the extensive use of glutamine CAG codon [29]. In this case, appropriate A-site codon occupation could be delayed due to low concentrations of cognate charged tRNA, leading to ribosome pausing. This is similar to an A-site sitting stop codon without its cognate release factor RF2 as described above. To see if the flanking structure effects are also applicable in hungry codon-mediated frameshifting regulation, we used a cysteine codon (UGU) to replace the UGA stop codon in the ribosomal A-site (Figure 8A). The cysteine concentration in the in vitro translation system was then reduced to mimic the hungry codon condition. Because GST-Rluc reporter possesses 4 cysteine amino acid residues upstream of the CUUUGA site, sequential dilutions of cysteine concentration were performed to optimize experimental conditions to ensure detectable levels of translation products while keeping the cysteine concentration as low as possible (Figure S6). By generating UGU (Cys) as a hungry codon at the ribosomal A-site, we observed +1 and \u22121 frameshifting stimulation by upstream H1 hairpin and downstream mPK, respectively (lanes 2 and 3 in Figure 8C). By contrast, destabilizing both structures by Watson-Crick base-pairing disruption (9G10A of H1 and G34C of mPK) almost abolished \u22121 frameshifting activity and strongly reduced +1 frameshifting activity (lane 1), while co-existence of stable flanking structures led to the compromise of both frameshifting pathways (lane 4). Thus, delay or interference in ribosomal A-site occupancy represents a parameter for translational reading-frame switch regulation that can be further tuned bi-directionally via stable mRNA duplexes flanking the elongation ribosome (Figure 8D).",

Therefore, their frameshifting regulation properties may share similar mechanisms. Extensive mutagenesis of E- site codon composition has demonstrated that E-site codon-anticodon stability reversely correlates with +1 frameshifting efficiency in CUUUGA frameshifting sites [30,31] and was proposed to be related to the E-site tRNA dissociation. Consistently, biochemical experiments on RF2 +1 frameshifting have shown that extending the internal SD-mediated duplex by base-pairing with E- site sequences can enhance +1 frameshifting efficiency and accelerate the dissociation of E-site tRNA [24]. Alternatively, the involvement of peptidyl-tRNA dissociation has also been proposed based on toe-printing analysis [32]. By contrast, the mPK \u22121 PRF stimulator downstream of a non-XXXYYYZ sequence was shown to delay E-site tRNA dissociation [33]. Thus, it is tempting to explain the reverse role in frameshifting regulation by the structures flanking different frameshifting sites through the mediation of opposite effects in the dissociation of E-site tRNA. However, our experimental approach was not capable of kinetic measurement for E-site tRNA dissociation although limited mutagenesis analysis of E-site sequence composition in Figure 5 suggests that stability of codon-anticodon interaction is not the main cause for switch in frameshifting pathways. Alternatively, upstream duplexes juxtaposing the E-site could simply act as a roadblock to hinder the backward movement of ribosome to attenuate \u22121 PRF. Nevertheless, our finding of co-existence of +1 and \u22121 frameshifting under the same sequence background represents an ideal framework for studying frameshifting pathway regulation by E-site tRNA dissociation kinetics as well as flanking structures via single-molecule approaches in the future.",

            "text": "Kinetic modeling and experimental analysis have suggested that \u22121 PRF can occur in either accommodation or two sequential post-translocation steps along the X XXY YYZ slippery site [34]. However, the non-canonical \u22121 frameshifting observed in sequence CCUUUGA does not fit into the XXXYYYZ consensus for \u22121 PRF slippery sequence. In a recent model of UUUAAAG-mediated \u22121 PRF, mPK was proposed to prolong elongation factor G (EF-G) release during post-translocation stage to interfere with the swiveling of the 30S subunit head and the coupled translocation [35,36,37,38], allowing the ribosome to sample alternative reading-frames [14]. By contrast, single-molecule fluorescence analysis of the DNAX \u22121 PRF motif argued that the accommodation step during delayed EF-G release determines reading-frame selection [13]. As a downstream mPK and the absence of RF2 are both required for the non-canonical \u22121 frameshifting in CUUUGA site, together with the results in Figure 6B, they support a model of UGA codon occupying the A-site followed by a 5-nucleotide spaced downstream mPK upon frameshifting (Figure 6C). Since EF-G has probably dissociated from the ribosome after the translocation step that positions the UGA codon into the A-site, it seems probable that reverse of 30S head swiveling is completed [38]. However, this raises questions about the role of the downstream hairpin or mPK in this process. Alternatively, downstream structures could still delay the translocation process to allow prolonged reading-frame sampling by the ribosome [13,14,39]. During this process the 0 frame and \u22121 frame codons in the A-site can both compete for their cognate ligands with the \u22121 frame pathway prevailing in the absence of RF2. Furthermore, slippage of peptidyl-tRNA by one nucleotide in the \u22121 frame is facilitated by an identical nucleotide bridging the 0 frame E- and P-sites as revealed in Figure 5, eventually leading to repositioning of the \u22121 frame codons in the P- and A- sites. However, our data are incapable of distinguishing the order between \u22121 frame slippage of peptidyl-tRNA and \u22121 frame A-site tRNA accommodation (pathways A and B in Figure 6C). Within these contexts, the finding that the duplex structures flanking the two sides of ribosomal mRNA-binding channel play reverse roles in frameshifting regulation complements current proposed \u22121 PRF stimulation models of downstream structures for a more complete picture of the dynamic interplay between ribosome and mRNA in frameshifting regulation.",

            "text": "This study has demonstrated that \u22121 PRF attenuation by a co-translationally refolding upstream hairpin is conserved between 70 S and 80S ribosomes. It further suggests that frameshifting attenuation activity is an intrinsic property of duplex-mediate structures that flank the mRNA-binding channel of an elongating ribosome, and could be masked by the composition of the sequence occupied by the ribosome. Furthermore, the tendency of an A-site empty ribosome to shift its reading-frame in either direction depending on the existence of flanking structures could provide a working model for unusual frameshifting events mediated by hungry codons in both 70S and 80S ribosomes. Unusual \u22121 frameshifting without an XXXYYYZ shifty site has been reported for the CAG trinucleotide expansion region of the MJD-1 transcript in spinocerebellar ataxias 3 as well as huntingtin in Huntington\u2019s disease [29,40]. Experimental evidence from CAG repeat expansion in huntingtin suggested that the consumption of glutamine-charged tRNA by the expanded repeats makes the glutamine-decoding CAG a hungry codon and eventually makes it frameshift-prone in the presence of CAG-mediated hairpin structures [41]. However, repeated CAG sequences lack an identical nucleotide to bridge the 0 frame E- and P- sites, and is consistent with the weak \u22121 frameshifting efficiency [29]. Additionally, long repeats are capable of generating both upstream and downstream CAG-mediated hairpins to flank the ribosome to further compromise frameshifting efficiency via frameshifting attenuation effects. By contrast, +1 frameshifting has also been reported for CAG repeat in huntingtin with the involvement of a weak UUCC +1 shifty site upstream of the expanded CAG repeats [42]. As expanded CAG repeats can form a downstream stable hairpin while an upstream CAG mediated hairpin refolds, attenuation of +1 frameshifting by a downstream hairpin could thus mask this mechanism.",

To construct pET GST-Rluc, Renilla luciferase gene (Rluc) was amplified using p2luc vector [22] as the template, and then cloned into EcoRI/NotI sites of pGEX-4T-1 (GE Healthcare), generating a GST-Rluc fusion protein gene (GST-Rluc). The gene of GST-Rluc was then amplified and inserted into NheI/NotI sites of pET-21a (+) (Merck Co. Inc.) to form pET GST-Rluc.

Due to the existence of multiple +1 and \u22121 frame stop codons in the N-terminal region of Rluc ORF, further deletions and site-directed point mutations were performed to generate pET GST-Rluc-1 for tracking single frameshifting event (\u22121 or +1) and double frameshifting events (\u22121 and +1).
