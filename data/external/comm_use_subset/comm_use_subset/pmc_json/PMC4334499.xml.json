Their genomes may consist of positive (+) sense, negative (-) sense or ambi-sense single-stranded (ss) RNA, or double-stranded (ds) RNA, and may take the form of a single or multiple segments that are packaged in single or multiple particles. RNA viruses also employ a plethora of strategies for replication and gene expression, and encode a vast array of structural and non-structural proteins, many of which are unique and have multiple, highly specialized functions [2]. Despite their diversity, RNA virus genomes are ubiquitously small, averaging only 10 kb, and with a maximum size of ~32 kb for some members of the order Nidovirales [3,4]. This size limitation has been linked to high mutation rates (a mean rate of ~1 mutation /genome /replication) due to replication with an error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that lacks proofreading capability [5,6]. High error rates are thought to limit genome sizes because, as size increases, the number of deleterious mutations also increases to levels beyond which reproduction of the fittest variant cannot be guaranteed [7,8].",

Rhabdoviruses have been identified in a very wide range of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish with many transmitted by arthropod vectors [14,15]. The family includes rabies virus (RABV), which causes over 25,000 human deaths annually [16], vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV), which has served as an important model for the study of many aspects of mammalian virus replication and virus-host interactions, and many other important pathogens of humans, livestock, farmed aquatic animals and food crops. The non-segmented [\u2013] ssRNA rhabdovirus genome is packaged within a characteristic bullet- or rod-shaped particle comprising five structural proteins\u2014the nucleoprotein (N), polymerase-associated phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) [17]. The genome features partially complementary, untranslated leader (l) and trailer (t) sequences and five ORFs arranged in the order 3\u2019-N-P-M-G-L-5\u2019. Each ORF is flanked by relatively conserved transcription initiation (TI) and transcription termination/polyadenylation (TTP) sequences which orchestrate expression of the five corresponding capped and polyadenylated mRNAs [17]. Rhabdovirus genomes may also contain additional ORFs encoding putative proteins, which are mostly of unknown function. These may occur as alternative or overlapping ORFs within the major structural protein genes or as independent ORFs flanked by TI or TTP sequences in the regions between the structural protein genes [15], some of which appear to have arisen by gene duplication [15,18\u201322].",

These additional ORFs were located either within the structural protein genes or in additional transcriptional units located in regions between these genes (Fig. 1).

The core TI sequence (UUGU) was conserved with some minor variations (CUGU, UUGC, UUGA, UCGU, UGAU) employed in some viruses.

Alternative ORFs are defined here as those which occur in a different frame within another longer ORF; overlapping ORFs are alternative ORFs which extend beyond the end of the primary ORF; and consecutive ORFs are those which do not overlap but follow consecutively within the same transcriptional unit. The arbitrary cut-off of \u2265180 nt (\u226560 aa) was selected on the basis that two small basic proteins of 55 and 65 amino acids (C and C\u2019) have been shown to be expressed from an alternative ORF within the VSIV P gene [23,24].

In several instances, viruses clustered closely with other members of a genus, yet we considered them to be unassigned species due to major differences in genomic architecture (see below). For example, the newly proposed genus Curiovirus comprises a monophyletic group of four viruses isolated from biting midges (Culicoides sp.), sandflies (Lutzomyia spp.) and mosquitoes (Coqillettidia and Trichoprosopon spp.) from the forests of South America and the Caribbean (S1 Table). The genomes of CURV, IRIRV, RBUV and ITAV all have one or more ORFs located between the M and G genes, and the G and L genes. In contrast, the closely related ARUV and INHV lack additional genes between the M and G and for this reason we have excluded them from the genus Curiovirus at this time. We also recognize the previous suggestion that CURV and ITAV should be assigned to a new genus for which the name Bracorhabdovirus (Brazilian Amazonian Culicoides rhabdoviruses) was proposed [27]. However, our analysis clearly indicates that this monophyletic group has a broader host range and geographic distribution than this regionally-derived name suggests.",

Variations in genome size were associated with: i) variation in the length of intergenic regions (IGRs) between transcriptional units; ii) variation in the length of 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 untranslated regions (UTRs) within individual transcriptional units; iii) the presence of additional transcriptional units containing long ORFs; and iv) the presence of overlapping or consecutive long ORFs within individual transcriptional units. An examination of genome size across the phylogeny revealed a general trend towards larger genomes in the lower third of the tree, which is comprised of the hapaviruses, curioviruses, tibroviruses and ephemeroviruses, as well as several unassigned viruses (S1 Fig.).

Interestingly, although substantial variation in the length of gene junctions was observed in several genera (including ephemeroviruses and lyssaviruses), most variation in genome size occurred as the result of the presence of new, non-canonical ORFs in the regions between the structural protein genes (Table 1). Although new ORFs were observed in each IGR across the phylogeny (N-P, P-M, M-G and G-L) their location was primarily restricted to a single IGR within each genus. For example, while hapavirus genome expansion occurred primarily in the P-M junction, genome expansion in the ephemeroviruses occurred at the G-L junction and tibrovirus and curiovirus genomes contained additional ORFs primarily in the M-G junction (Table 1). This suggests that once a new ORF arises at a particular gene junction within a lineage, further expansion is more likely to continue at the same gene junction, rather than begin anew elsewhere in the genome.",

Furthermore, although all lyssaviruses (such as WCBV) featured a high proportion of untranslated sequences (primarily evident as a very long 3\u2019UTR in the G gene), there was no consistent association between the proportion of untranslated sequences and genus assignment (Fig. 3). For example, in the genus Hapavirus, the proportion of untranslated sequences in the two largest genomes varied from 1.1% (NGAV) to 6.4% (LJV). Similarly, in the genus Ephemerovirus the proportion of untranslated sequences varied from 1.2% in the smallest genome (YATV) to 9.6% in the largest genome (KOOLV).

Previous studies have provided evidence of gene duplication in the Rhabdoviridae, involving the G and GNS genes [18,21] and the \u03b2 and \u03b3 genes [22] in the ephemeroviruses, and the U1, U2 and U3 genes in the hapaviruses FLAV and WONV [15,19,20]. To identify further examples of gene duplication, we conducted a BLAST analysis of all proteins in our database (E-value <1e-3) and used ClustalX alignments to confirm sequence similarity. By this analysis, ORFs located between the P and M genes of most hapaviruses encode proteins which share detectable sequence similarity. This family of homologous P-M intergenic region proteins (PMIPs) includes the U1, U2 and U3 proteins of LJV, WONV, PCV, ORV, LJAV, MANV, MQOV, FLAV, HPV, KAMV and MOSV (S2 Fig. and S3 Fig.), as well as the U1x proteins of MANV and GLOV which are encoded in ORFs overlapping their respective U1 ORFs (S4 Fig.). Although pairwise alignments provide clear evidence for homology, the hapavirus PMIPs share generally low levels of sequence identity and no universally conserved motifs, indicating considerable structural and functional divergence from their ancestral homolog. Proteins encoded in the P-M region in other hapaviruses (i.e., JOIV U1, NGAV U1, U1x and NGAV U2) failed to display significant similarity with the PMIPs or evidence of gene duplication but this may be due to further structural divergence. Additional evidence of gene duplication included the U2 and U3 proteins of JOIV (encoded in ORFs located between the G and L genes), and the N-terminal regions of the P proteins and the upstream U1 accessory proteins of the sripuviruses CHOV and SMV, each of which share significant sequence similarity (S5 Fig.). These data suggest that the U1 protein of the sripuviruses originated from a duplication of the P gene, with the downstream copy of the gene retaining the parental function. Similarly, in the curioviruses there is extensive amino acid sequence similarity between the U3 proteins of CURV and IRIRV and the N-terminal region of the G proteins, suggesting evolution of U3 through partial duplication of the G gene, which lies immediately downstream.",

Viroporins are small hydrophobic proteins that oligomerize in host cell membranes to form hydrophilic pores, disrupting various cellular processes and promoting virus replication [28]. ORFs encoding viroporin-like proteins were found in more than one-third of the rhabdoviruses in the data set, either as overlapping or consecutive ORFs within the G gene, or in additional transcriptional units following the G (or GNS) gene (Fig. 1). ORFs encoding putative viroporins were evident in the genomes of all ephemeroviruses, tibroviruses, hapaviruses, bahiaviruses, almendraviruses and curioviruses, as well as the unassigned species ARUV and INHV (Fig. 4). Several of these proteins have been identified previously [19,22,29\u201335]. Like the BEFV \u03b11 protein for which viroporin activity has been confirmed experimentally, these proteins have the structure characteristics of class IA viroporins, including a central transmembrane and a highly basic C-terminal domain. However, although located in similar positions in the genomes, they are generally too divergent in sequence to establish orthology [22,36].",

This arrangement was described previously in VSIV, in which two small basic proteins of 55 and 65 amino acids (C and C\u2019) are expressed from an alternative ORF within the P gene [23,24]. On this basis, we scanned the rhabdovirus genome data set for alternative ORFs of various size ranges and observed that the frequency varied from ~2.3/genome for ORFs in the range of 90\u2013150 nt (30\u201350 amino acids) to ~8.6/genome for range 150\u2013210 nt (30\u201370 amino acids) (Fig. 6). Alternative ORFs \u226560 amino acids occurred in each of the structural protein genes (N, P, M, G and L) and in the additional transcriptional units between the P and M genes. They were most common in the P and least common in the M genes. As observed in other viruses, expression of these alternative ORFs could occur by leaky ribosomal scanning, allowing initiation of transcription by a proportion of ribosomes on the alternative start codon [41]. Although, it is not known which (if any) of these alternative ORFs are expressed, several factors are likely to be important in determining the probability and level of expression: i) the Kozak contexts of the first and alternative initiation codons; ii) the length of the alternative ORF (longer ORFs are less likely to occur by chance); iii) the location of the alternative ORF (distally located ORFs are less likely to be expressed in long transcripts); and iv) the expression level of the transcript (L gene transcripts are likely to be the least abundant). For example, short ORFs with initiation codons in poor Kozak context at the distal end of the L gene are not likely to be expressed at significant levels, if at all. However, in some cases, closely related viruses were found to contain alternative ORFs at the same genome location, with initiation codons in good context and encoding predicted polypeptides with high levels of sequence identity (S2 Table). Such arrangements occurred in the N genes of HPV and FLAV, the P genes of MANV and MQOV, the U2 and M genes of KAMV and MOSV, and near the start of the G genes of the sripuviruses (NIAV, SRIV, CHOV and SMV); these proteins are considered very likely to be both expressed and functional.",

Previous studies have surveyed known rhabdoviruses for biological and genomic diversity, revealed phylogenetic relationships, and considered factors that may have determined their rates of evolution [14,15,47,48]. In this study, we greatly expanded the repertoire of rhabdovirus genome sequences, which demonstrate extensive variation in genome size and complexity, allowing the assignment of seven proposed new genera. We also identified patterns of accessory gene evolution and expression, and showed that changes in rhabdovirus genome length and composition have occurred throughout the evolutionary history of the family, primarily through the generation and loss of new transcriptional units. This observation is especially striking given the obvious constraints on viral genome size [7].",

As many of these ORFs occur as additional transcriptional units complete with conserved transcriptional control sequences, there is a high likelihood that they would be expressed in infected cells. Expression of ORFs located in additional transcriptional units has been demonstrated previously for several ephemeroviruses and for the hapavirus WONV [18,21,30,31,36,49]. Others occur as either alternative or overlapping ORFs. Further studies are required to determine which of these ORFs may be expressed, but we suggest that expression is likely when both the encoded amino acid sequence and the translational context are conserved in related species.",

Sequence similarity, when detected, occurred only between closely related viruses assigned to a genus and, although some accessory protein families were identified, these were more commonly related by shared structural characteristics, such as charged or transmembrane domains, than by sequence. This has been observed previously for so-called orphan (\u2018ORFan\u2019) proteins in other viruses and bacteria. It has been suggested that the uniqueness of orphan proteins, or their restriction to a single species or genus, is the result of creation de novo, rather than by recombination or lateral gene transfer, and that they play an \u2018accessory\u2019 role in viral pathogenicity or transmission instead of having functions in virion structure or replication [50\u201352]. It has also been observed that many orphan proteins are predicted to be highly disordered in structure or, when ordered, structural resolution has revealed unique folds [50]. As such, future determination of the biological activities of the plethora of novel proteins identified here will require functional studies that may well provide important insights into aspects of infection and immunity as well as fundamental cellular processes and pathways.",

Indeed, the presence of new ORFs and/or very long stretches of non-coding sequence within or between transcriptional units was noted frequently. Previous observations have demonstrated that foreign genes of up to ~6 kb can be inserted into the VSIV genome without significant disruption to viral replication in vitro [53,54]. Expanded VSIV genomes were morphologically similar but proportionally longer than wild-type viruses, suggesting that the unique morphology of the rhabdovirus particle may more readily accommodate genome expansion than other virion structures. A significant body of evidence suggests that genome size in RNA viruses is likely to be constrained by low replication fidelity [7,8], and a relationship between genome size and error rate has been observed in a diverse array of organisms [55]. However, if the genome sizes of rhabdoviruses are constrained by selective pressures other than (or in addition to) those imposed by the background mutation rate, genome expansion may not require a concomitant reduction in polymerase error rates. As the mutation rate of rhabdoviruses has only been determined experimentally for VSIV thus far (~6 \u00d7 10\u20136 subs/nucleotide/replication), it is impossible to assess whether the increases in genome size observed here have been associated with concomitant reductions in mutation rate [48].",

This suggests that the acquisition and loss of new genes and intergenic regions may be a regular feature of rhabdovirus evolution. Previous studies of RNA viruses have concluded that constraints on genome size imposed by polymerase error have led to various strategies to minimize genome size while increasing functional complexity, such as gene overlaps and protein multi-functionality [9,56]. Given these size constraints, it is unclear why long non-coding regions would arise both within and between transcriptional units and be maintained throughout the evolution of some rhabdovirus genera. It has been known for many years that a long 3\u2019-UTR of unknown function (\u03c8 region) in the G gene of RABV is unnecessary for efficient replication in cell culture or in mice, but may play a role in neuroinvasion [57\u201359]. Indeed, the retention of similar \u03c8 regions in all lyssaviruses and the existence of long UTRs and IGRs in other rhabdoviruses suggests that they must provide some fitness advantage in vivo, such as stabilising RNA secondary structure, serving as a source of, or targets for, micro RNAs, or attenuating transcription of downstream genes to achieve the most effective balance of gene expression. Indeed, an analysis of patterns and rates of sequence evolution in the Rhabdoviridae and other families in the Mononegavirales revealed that, although non-coding regions are less conserved than those that encode proteins, their evolutionary rates are associated with relative genomic position, suggesting that they impact on gene expression [60].",

Notably, insertions at the N-P junction are rare, with a single additional ORF present in the closely related sripuviruses CHOV and SMV, and short overlapping ORFs present within the N gene transcriptional unit in some hapaviruses. It has been reported previously in a study of VSIV recombinants that only the N-P gene junction was refractory to the stable expression of an inserted transcriptional unit, and resulted in a virus with significantly reduced replication efficiency [61]. In contrast, transcriptional units inserted at other gene junctions were stably expressed, maintained through repeated passages and had no effect on replication efficiency. As the insertion of additional transcriptional units attenuates expression levels of all downstream genes, this may be associated with the importance of maintaining precise control of N and P protein ratios in infected cells to ensure efficient switching between the transcription and replication modes of the ribonucleoprotein complex [62,63].",

In each of these viruses, small ORFs of various lengths occur within most transcriptional units; and although only those \u2265180 nt have been catalogued here, there are numerous other smaller ORFs throughout most genomes. It is reasonable to assume that, although the polypeptides encoded in many of these ORFs may not be expressed at all during infection, some may be expressed through leaky ribosomal scanning. These are likely to represent a rich genetic resource for the evolution of new functional genes in RNA viruses [4], triggering the rapid evolution of highly specialised functions. Contemporarily, the evolution of a suitable Kozak context, TURBS motifs and ribosomal frame-shift sites would allow optimal expression within the parental transcriptional unit. Ultimately, these new ORFs may become uncoupled from the parental gene through gene (sequence) duplication [18]. As observed previously, this process would allow unconstrained evolution of the new ORF and loss of the redundant copy of the parental ORF [4,64]. Alternatively, new genes may also evolve independently of existing ORFs. In some rhabdoviruses in our data set, very long non-coding regions (up to 749 nt) were present either within or between transcriptional units that could serve as a resource to spawn genes de novo in the absence of the evolutionary constraints imposed on alternative or overlapping ORFs. This is most likely to occur when ORFs are present in transcribed non-coding regions (UTRs) such as the \u03c8 region of WCBV in which, uniquely amongst lyssaviruses, an ORF of 180 nt has been identified [65]. The creation of new genes de novo in non-transcribed IGRs, such as those present in the G-L gene junctions of LJV, KOTV and KOOLV, almost certainly would require prior or simultaneous evolution of new or modified transcriptional control sequences to allow their expression.",

In Central American isolates of VSIV, for example, imprecise reiterative insertions of up to 300 nt in the 5\u2019-UTR of the G-gene (variations of 3\u2019-UUUUUAA-5\u2019) have been attributed to non-templated extension by polymerase stutter at the TTP sequence [66,67]. Although homologous recombination appears to be very rare in mononegaviruses [68], and we found no evidence of lateral gene transfer, we cannot exclude their involvement in rhabdovirus genome expansion. It is also evident that although there is an overall trend toward an expansion of genome size and complexity in the rhabdoviruses, gene loss is also likely to have occurred periodically throughout the evolution of the family. For example, the ephemerovirus \u03b3 proteins appear to have been lost in ARV and OBOV, and the hapavirus PMIPs are entirely absent only from MCOV (Fig. 1). Although our data suggests that gene gain is a more frequent process than gene loss, we acknowledge that, if loss is very frequent, we might not be able to observe it given the available data. This may be resolved in the future with the acquisition of significantly more genomes sampled more closely in time. Indeed, as defective-interfering particles are known to occur commonly in rhabdoviruses, a mechanism for purging redundant sequences appears to be readily available [69\u201371]. Nevertheless, it is evident that a remarkable capacity for genomic plasticity through the gain and loss of accessory functions has been a central theme of rhabdovirus evolution.",

For example, amongst the Paramyxoviridae genome length varies by 46.5% from human metapneumovirus (13,113 nt) to Beilong virus (19, 212 nt), and paramyxoviruses also contain novel accessory genes in transcriptional units inserted at various gene junctions [72]. The apparent propensity for genome expansion in mononegaviruses may be due to their discontinuous transcription strategy which generates multiple viral mRNAs. Sequence insertions within and between the individual transcriptional units of mononegaviruses are less likely to disrupt gene expression than in (+) ssRNA viruses in which the genome commonly encodes a single polyprotein which is processed post-translationally.",

There are currently no formal criteria for genus demarcation in rhabdoviruses. A system of genetic classification (DEmARC) that allows demarcation of viral taxa based on pairwise evolutionary distances has been proposed and, for picornaviruses, was shown to be comparable to expert-based taxonomic classification [73,74]. However, the application of this approach to the Rhabdoviridae would likely require a larger set of sequenced genomes at lower taxonomic levels [75], and would be compromised by extensive rate variation among lineages (as this leads to biases in genetic distance measurements). In the taxonomy of higher organisms, to be descriptively useful, a genus should be monophyletic, reasonably compact, and ecologically, morphologically, or biogeographically distinct [76]. Our assignment of new genera in the Rhabdoviridae has been based primarily on the identification of well-supported monophyletic groups using unambiguously aligned regions of the L gene, together with a consideration of common features of genome organisation and known aspects of viral ecology. Genome organisation has proven here to be a useful taxonomic marker as similar arrangements of accessory genes and other conserved elements of genome architecture appear to be the result of significant evolutionary events that provide resolution between the family and species levels. For some of the new genera, host and/or vector associations have also been relatively informative but in many cases, only single isolates of a species are available and else little is known of their ecology. It is likely that the proposed assignments of viruses to genera and the placement of the proposed unassigned species will evolve into a more complete taxonomic description as more viruses are discovered and as ecological data accumulates.",

Amino acid sequence alignments containing all putative matches to each ORF were then created using Clustal X and evidence of structural and sequence similarity was investigated by visual inspection.

We initially attempted to root the tree using a standard outgroup method. Members of the rhabdovirus genera that infect plants (i.e., Cytorhabdovirus and Nucleorhabdovirus) were excluded as their sequences were highly divergent. We therefore utilized four members of the genus Novirhabdovirus (Infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus ADB93801; Viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus BAH57327; Hirame rhabdovirus ACO87999; and Snakehead rhabdovirus NP050585) as outgroups. Unfortunately, these novirhabdovirus sequences were also far too divergent (>>1 amino acid change per site under multiple amino acid substitution models; results available on request) to establish a reliable rooting for our data set, as three different basal groups were identified using different models of amino acid substitution, although overall tree topologies were similar among substitution models (results available on request). In addition, the use of the novirhabdoviruses as outgroups resulted in excessive numbers of residues being removed following Gblocks pruning (see below). Based on the observation that most known rhabdoviruses are either insect viruses or replicate in insect vectors, it has been reasonably argued that plant and animal rhabdoviruses may have origins in insects [82]. We therefore selected the rooting scheme that best fit this theory. To this end, we choose one of the two basal clades from the novirhabdovirus-rooted tree, comprising viruses isolated from mosquitoes (i.e., the almendraviruses), as the most divergent group. We then repeated the phylogenetic analysis (procedure described below) excluding the novirhabdoviruses and rooting it on the almendraviruses. Importantly, the choice of outgroup did not influence relationships either between or within the major clades demonstrating strong bootstrap support (BSP \u2265 85).",
