Within these hosts, 16 haemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoprotein types have been described. The HA and NA types carried by the virus are used for classification and can be found in various combinations, such as A/H5N1 and A/H3N2. Wild birds have been implicated in the global dissemination of AIVs and, in some instances, the introduction of AIVs into domestic poultry populations.1 Although low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses (which have limited impact on poultry mortalities) constitute the majority of these viruses, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses such as A/H5N1 can result in mortalities approaching 100% when introduced into domestic flocks.2",

When an animal is co-infected with two different influenza viruses, reassortment of these RNA segments can occur, resulting in a new virus with characteristics distinct from the parent viruses.3 The 2009 emergence and resulting pandemic from A/H1N1pdm09 virus was caused by a virus that underwent multiple reassortment events with strains from pigs, birds and humans before suddenly gaining the ability to efficiently transmit between humans.4 Pandemic events resulting from reassortment of influenza viruses have occurred at least three times in the last 100 years,5, 6 resulting in high human morbidity and mortality worldwide. The most severe influenza pandemic in recorded history, the 1918 \u2018Spanish flu', is thought to have arose from an avian influenza strain that directly adapted to the human host.7 Clearly it is imperative that close monitoring of reassortments and mammalian-adapted mutations in avian influenza strains is needed.",

Co-infections between AIVs were not detected in any poultry samples. Many other partial HA and NA sequences were also generated, but not included in these results due to difficulties in determining close phylogenetic relationships from incomplete gene sequences.

During 2013 alone, 26 human A/H5N1 cases (14 deaths) were detected in Cambodia, a dramatic increase in the 21 total cases that had been detected in the preceding 8 years, 2005\u20132012. This rise in reported human cases of A/H5N1 coincided with the emergence of a reassortant virus that contained the HA and NA genes from the previously circulating clade 1.1.2 genotype Z virus, and the matrix and internal genes from a clade 2.3.2.1 virus previously circulating in southern Vietnam.10 Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the HA and NA genes (Figure 4) and the matrix and internal genes (Supplementary Figure S1) from the A/H5N1 market strains revealed that all of the viruses clustered closely with other clade 1.1.2 reassortant strains associated with poultry outbreaks and human cases in 2013.10 Questions remain regarding the causes of the dramatic increase in human cases in 2013 and whether the reassortant strain is more transmissible in poultry, resulting in the intense circulation that we observed in this report. Alternatively, increased surveillance and education of clinicians may have resulted in improved detection of human A/H5N1 cases. Presently we do not know the exact role played by LBMs in the infection of poultry workers and market clients.",

In particular, increased circulation of influenza A viruses was detected during the period between the Lunar New Year and Khmer New Year festivals. A previous study on the poultry trade links in Cambodia established that there was a significant increase in the trade volume of poultry prior to these festivals, with an assumed rise in cross-border poultry trade in response to increased demand.18 The greater volume of poultry trade and the expansion of poultry trading networks during these festival periods present opportunities for virus spread throughout domestic flocks and the introduction of new strains of AIVs. Peaks in AIV levels were also observed during times that were not associated with known festivals (e.g. week 25 and 35). Climatic factors, which were not analysed in this study, are also likely to have an influence on levels of AIV circulation. Knowledge of these periods of intense circulation should inform future control policies such as targeted poultry vaccination, quarantining and improved market cleaning. Such measures have proven effective in reducing avian influenza viral isolation rates in LBMs35, 36, 37 and may reduce the spread of AIVs back to farms through fomites and personnel.38",

We observed that 20\u201330 carcasses were often washed in the same container of water before it was refreshed. These samples were positive for influenza A RNA in 75% of samples from all four markets (ranging from 63 to 86%). Poultry drinking water was also a useful surveillance sample, with 50% of samples testing positive for influenza A RNA; A/H5N1 isolation rates were higher when compared to carcass wash water. Detection rates and isolation rates were also high with soil/mud and discarded feather samples, but these specimens required more complex processing before testing. High contamination of the LBM environment, including relatively high rates of virus isolation, is evidence that the risk of human exposure is very high. Carcass wash water and poultry drinking water samples proved a useful adjunct to poultry swabs for monitoring purposes in the LBMs.",

This situation increases the likelihood of reassortment events occurring, which may result in the emergence of new influenza subtypes. The recent emergence of reassortant HPAI subtypes of H5, such as A/H5N2, A/H5N5, A/H5N6 and A/H5N8,39, 40, 41, 42, 43 is evidence of the risk of new viruses arising through reassortment events with A/H5N1. The sudden emergence of multiple H5 subtypes has not been adequately explained but could be related to the diversity of AIVs currently circulating in domestic poultry populations. The emergence of A/H7N9 virus in China in early 201344 has also prompted increased concerns about the possibility of a pandemic virus emerging in the Asia-Pacific region. Although most of the non-H5 AIVs detected in this study likely pose little or no risk to humans, the high prevalence of multiple avian influenza strains is an indictment on the poor biosecurity associated with poultry rearing and selling in the region. Previous studies and surveillance have also established that there is intense circulation of poultry between regions and across borders, which facilitates the regional spread of AIVs.9, 23",

In addition, multiplex testing was only conducted where there was disparity between M-gene and H5 qRT-PCR assays. Furthermore, due to the difficulties with classifying influenza viruses using incomplete gene sequences we have only reported LPAI detection where we have been able to generate full HA or NA sequences. It is therefore likely that the true prevalence of non-H5 AIVs was far greater than what we have reported in these market samples. The potential for reassortment between AIVs, including A/H5N1, could result in the emergence of viral strains with considerable impacts on poultry and/or human health. This study, coupled with other recent studies in LBMs from other Asian countries,15, 16, 17 confirms that the environment of LBMs provides a pool of genes for potential emergence of new pandemic viruses. The silent circulation of a multitude of LPAI viruses, which remain undetected and unmonitored in most Asian countries, heightens the threat when they co-circulate with pandemic candidates such as A/H5N1 and A/H7N9.",

It has been reported that asymptomatic and mild avian influenza infections lead to seroconversions with low antibody titres that quickly decrease below the threshold recommended by WHO for a confirmed A/H5N1 case (HIA\u2265160; MN\u226580).45 For this reason, we considered as positive all individuals with a HIA titre of \u226580 and a MN titre of \u226540, which is consistent46 or more stringent47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 than the cut-off levels suggested by other authors. However, it is difficult to directly compare the results between studies as there is no consensus on the antibody titre that results from a mild or asymptomatic infection, and consistent cut-off levels have not been used in past studies. According to our classification, 4.5% of workers who participated in the study had antibodies against A/H5N1. This prevalence is much higher than that reported among LBM workers in Egypt,53 Thailand47 or China,54 and much higher than in villagers in Thailand51 or Cambodia.48 The incidence was 3.7 per 1000 person-months in our study, a figure twice that described in Bangladesh in 2009\u20132010.46 There were no reported clinical signs in our cohort, confirming that a large proportion of human A/H5N1 infections may go undetected. Poultry workers in Cambodia and other Asian countries, where there is endemic circulation of A/H5N1, are constantly exposed to high levels of virus. Although this may lead to mild or sub-clinical infections with seroconversions, it seems that transmission to humans resulting in acute infections is still rare.",

Although A/H9N2 viruses have low pathogenicity for poultry, novel HPAI and LPAI viruses affecting humans, such as A/H5N1, A/H7N9 and A/H10N8, contain internal genes originating from influenza A/H9N2.55, 56, 57 This may have facilitated the ability of these viruses to cause infection and deaths in humans. Human infections with A/H9N2 have been reported in the literature, and seroprevalence studies have suggested that asymptomatic or mild infections commonly occur in high-risk locations such as LBMs and slaughterhouses.50, 53, 58, 59 The detection of A/H9N2 antibodies in 1.8% of LBM workers participating in our study and an incidence of 0.9 infections per 1000 person-months confirm other data on poultry-to-human transmission of A/H9N2,53, 59 including among rural villagers in Cambodia.48 In addition, A/H9N2 infections have also been detected in other mammals such as guinea pigs, dogs, horses and pigs.59, 60 The ability of A/H9N2 to cross the species barrier and the relatively high frequency in which it has been implicated in reassortment events suggest that this virus significantly contributes to the emergence of viruses that pose an important public health risk and should therefore be very closely monitored.",
