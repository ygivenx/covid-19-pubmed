DENV infection manifests clinically as dengue fever or the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [4]. The increased spread of dengue virus and its mosquito vectors in many subtropical regions over the past several decades, especially in Latin America and Asia [5], highlights the need for additional methods of dengue virus surveillance. Diagnosing dengue relies on detecting viral nucleic acid or antigens in the blood or confirming the presence of anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies and therefore traditionally depends on RT-PCR, ELISA, and viral cell culture methods [5]\u2013[7]. Dengue diagnostics are of crucial importance due to its broad spectrum of clinical presentations, global emergence and spread, unique disease epidemiology, and possible clinical relation to other as-yet unknown tropical febrile pathogens.",

The Virochip is a pan-viral microarray platform that has been previously utilized in the detection and discovery of viruses from both human and animal samples [15]\u2013[19]. Deep sequencing and shotgun sequencing of human clinical samples has been used for viral detection [20]\u2013[23], novel virus discovery [24]\u2013[27], and divergent virus genome recovery [28]. Viral metagenomic approaches have also been employed as a diagnostic supplement to pathogen detection as part of public health monitoring systems [22], but have been limited to shotgun sequencing of viral-enriched libraries and have yet to utilize deep sequencing data. Currently available sequencing platforms can generate millions to billions of sequencing reads per run, far exceeding large-scale shotgun sequencing [13]. Deep sequencing of clinical samples, in which hundreds of thousands to millions of sequencing reads are generated per sample, can be incorporated into stepwise virus detection pipelines [29]. Database searches using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and other alignment tools [30] can be used to identify sequences in samples that correspond to known and novel viruses, including those present at low concentrations or deriving from viruses that may be too divergent to be detected with PCR or microarray methods. Deep sequencing represents an unbiased, highly sensitive method for identifying viral nucleic acid in clinical samples.",

Library generation primers (Table S1) were modified from adapter A and adapter B sequences (Illumina). Samples were reverse transcribed and libraries were created and amplified as described above for the Virochip. Library molecules of approximately 300 bp were purified on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, ethanol precipitated, and PCR amplified for 17 additional cycles using a 22-nt-long primer consisting of the 3\u2032-end of Illumina adapter A (primer 2) and the full-length 61-bp Illumina adapter B (primer 4) under the following conditions: 2 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 40\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 15 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. Amplicons generated with the correct adapter topology (one end with adapter A and the other with adapter B) were approximately 355 bp and were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from adapter A/A and adapter B/B amplicons, which migrate differently (approximately 40 bp smaller or larger than the expected size). An additional 10 cycles of PCR were then performed using the full-length adapter sequences as primers (primers 3 and 4). Libraries were validated by Sanger sequencing before high throughput sequencing. Following validation, samples were combined into five pools for sequencing. For pools one through four reverse transcription primers included a three or four-nucleotide barcode sequence at the 3\u2032-end. For pool five, barcodes were located internally in the adapter sequence. Each pool was sequenced on one lane of a flowcell on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (pools 1\u20134) or HiSeq 2000 (pool 5). Pools' 1\u20134 molecules were sequenced as 67 nucleotide paired ends, and pool 5 molecules as 97 nucleotide paired ends. Paired-end sequencing was performed for several reasons: (1) to double the overall amount of data generated, (2) to double the amount of sequence information per molecule, and (3) to provide anchors from which additional sequence could be recovered by subsequent PCR.",

Paired reads for which at least one of the reads in the pair had at least 80% identity to the database were marked as human and removed from subsequent analyses. After removal of reads identified as human by BLAT, remaining reads were aligned and filtered by mapping to the human transcriptome using nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn version 2.2.21, word size 30, E value 10\u22123).

To look for reads with viral homology, we searched the non-redundant nucleotide database (nt) using BLASTn (word size 20, E value 10\u22123). Reads that did not map to nt were aligned to the non-redundant protein database (nr) using translated BLAST (BLASTx, word size 4, E value 10).",

In a number of datasets, we detected human klassevirus 1, a virus identified and studied in our lab [26], human poliovirus, used in our Virochip sensitivity experiments, sequences from mosquito densoviruses, also studied in the lab, as well as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV), the polymerase of which was used in the sequence library preparation. We believe these reads represent lab contaminants, and others studies that prepared sequence libraries in the same location have reported similar findings [41]. To account for these contaminants, positive calls were only made on viruses for which there were more supporting reads than there were reads to any known contaminant.

Despite the headway, metagenomic virus detection studies will have to confront several remaining difficulties concerning diagnostic accuracy. Foremost concerns include enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of deep sequencing-based diagnostic methods and re-evaluating the evidence for disease causality in light of increasingly sensitive nucleic acid detection and pathogen discovery methods. The former will require improved strategies to biochemically enrich and computationally identify viral sequences while reducing host background sequences. The latter will require a cautious reconsideration of criteria used to establish causal links between microbes and disease, as well as extensive case-by-case follow-up studies employing classical laboratory methods, such as serological analysis and cell culture amplification. It is important to highlight that observing viral sequence in sequencing data is insufficient to establish the role of a virus in disease causality. Like other detection strategies, deep sequencing will serve to inform secondary tests, including seroconversion assays, further nucleic acid testing, cell culture amplification, and additional investigations into plausible disease mechanisms.",

The sensitivity of deep sequencing is limited by the number of reads generated per sample, or read depth. In this study, we detected virus sequences down to two parts per million. Nearly every virus that was detected on the microarray was also detected by deep sequencing; additionally, in numerous samples (n = 44), sequencing revealed viruses not detected by the Virochip (Table 1). There were two instances where Virochip analysis identified a virus (TTV) that was not detected by deep sequencing (Table 1). Deep sequencing, therefore, is a superior method for novel virus discovery, because it is more sensitive and provides more conclusive genotypic information than the Virochip.

Some circovirus species, such as beak and feather disease virus and porcine circovirus 2, have been associated with disease in bird and pig hosts, respectively, but the pathogenic potential of circoviruses in humans remains unconfirmed [63], [64]. The circovirus-like sequences reported here were detected in nucleic acid libraries prepared from acute human serum and were most closely related to circovirus-like viruses (Figure 3), which were first reported in environmental samples and in bats [45], [48]. We were unsuccessful in recovering a full genome sequence corresponding to any of the circovirus-like sequences, and it has not yet been possible to prove that these sequences were not an environmental artifact introduced during sample preparation. It is also possible that these sequences derive from other organisms, such as Giardia intestinalis or Entamoeba dispar, whose genomes encode proteins that share amino acid similarity with circovirus replicase proteins (Figure 3). Furthermore, it has yet to be established whether circoviruses are capable of replicating in humans. Pending additional screening and serologic studies, the detection of circovirus-like sequences from human serum should be interpreted with caution.",

The findings presented in this study further our knowledge of well-characterized and previously unknown viruses present in serum collected from pediatric dengue-like illness patients and advance our understanding of the application of metagenomic approaches to human pathogen detection. Deep sequencing analysis of clinical samples holds tremendous promise as a diagnostic tool by permitting the detection of many different viruses simultaneously, including those present at low-copy numbers and of divergent origin. Major remaining barriers to high-throughput sequencing strategies becoming standard diagnostic practice include prohibitive cost, lengthy sample preparation time, and computationally intensive data analysis requirements. These challenges are magnified in resource-limited settings, such as Nicaragua, but are gradually being addressed. Industry hardware and technical advancements have steadily decreased the per-base cost of deep sequencing, and the results presented here strengthen our expectations of multiplexed sample preparation and bioinformatic data filtering within the framework of current second-generation sequencing platforms. Long-term bi-directional partnerships with developing country collaborators facilitate easier access to techniques not currently available on-site, such as deep sequencing, and are also important in providing training opportunities for local scientists and developing relevant pathogen tests and diagnostic policies.",
