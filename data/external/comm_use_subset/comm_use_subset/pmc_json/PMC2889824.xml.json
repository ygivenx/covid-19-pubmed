The membrane fusion process is energetically favorable and essentially irreversible, but has a considerable kinetic energy barrier [1]. These proteins allow rapid membrane fusion by drawing the opposing membranes together and either stabilizing or providing the activation energy to surmount the transition state [1], [2]. In this way, they behave in many aspects like a fusion catalyst. Because they effect a macromolecular process that involves large scale conformational changes in the substrate membranes and the proteins themselves, these proteins possess multiple interacting surfaces that could be targeted by inhibitors [3].",

To date, most progress with viral fusion protein inhibitors has focused on class I alpha helical proteins. The HIV TM protein provides an excellent example of targeting distinct, interacting surfaces for inhibition. The HIV TM functions as a homotrimer with each monomer contributing two alpha helical regions that interact to form a post-fusion six-helix bundle. Inhibition of the formation of this six-helix bundle can be accomplished by exogenous peptides mimicking either of the two reciprocally interacting helices [5]\u2013[7].",

            "text": "Only a few examples of viral entry inhibitors with activity against the primarily beta sheet envelope proteins (E) from flaviviruses have been described [8]\u2013[10]. However, few of these have taken advantage of the available crystal structures of flavivirus E proteins, including both pre-fusion and post-fusion forms [11]\u2013[22]. The authors of some of these structures have predicted that several regions of these proteins might be targets for inhibition [11], [14], [15]. Here we report the use of structural data from the pre-fusion dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) E protein as a model for a computational approach to the design of new peptide inhibitors of DENV-2 entry. This approach makes use of a residue-specific all-atom probability discriminatory function (RAPDF) score to identify in situ amino acid sequences that are likely to have high structural and binding stability [23], [24]. Out of seven computationally designed peptides that were synthesized and tested, two were identified as possessing fifty percent in vitro inhibitory activity (IC50) below 10 \u00b5M and another with IC50 activity below 40 \u00b5M. Two of the inhibitors (DN57opt and DN81opt) are binding optimized variants of peptides originally designed from DENV inhibitory peptide sequences located in domain II near the domain I/domain II hinge region [9]. The other (1OAN1) is an entirely novel peptide designed from an extended beta sheet region comprising the first connection between domains I and II. We show that the two peptides with the highest inhibitory activity interfere with virus:cell binding, cause structural changes to the surface of DENV-2 virions, and bind specifically to purified DENV-2 E protein.",

Complicating this situation, the four distinct serotypes of DENV generate only low level immunological cross protection, allowing for repeated epidemic outbreaks in the same populations [27], [28]. The phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement has been shown to result in more severe disease in individuals who have been previously infected with a different serotype [29]\u2013[33]. With no specific treatment or prevention available other than vector control, DENV is an important target for the development of antivirals and vaccines.

The x-ray diffraction structure of DENV-2 envelope protein (Protein Data Bank identifier 1OAN) was used as a template for creating mutant structures from which the peptides were derived [14]. For each peptide, we randomly selected a residue side chain and substituted it with a new side chain. The substitution was performed using a backbone-dependent side chain rotamer library and a linear repulsive steric energy term provided by SCWRL version 3.0 [34]. The resulting all-atom models were energy minimized for 200 steps using the Energy Calculation and Dynamics (ENCAD) program [35]\u2013[37]. RAPDF scores were then calculated to estimate the structural stability of a given E protein structure derivative. For a selected residue, side chain substitution was carried out ten times. The amino acid that produced the best RAPDF score was selected and used as a template for further mutation. The entire mutation process was repeated 100,000 times to enable a rigorous search for peptides that produced the best RAPDF score (i.e., highest predicted stability).",

A Metropolis Monte Carlo search algorithm [38] was used to change each amino acid in the 20 residue window to one of the other 19 naturally occurring amino acids, and the stability of corresponding peptide in the context of the entire E protein structure was evaluated. This process was iterated 100,000 times using RAPDF as the target scoring function. The Metropolis criterion was used to select a particular change in the simulation: if a particular change resulted in a better RAPDF score (lower pseudoenergy), then it was retained. If a particular change resulted in a worse RAPDF score (higher pseudoenergy), then a random choice, based on the score difference between the previous change and the current one, was made to retain the corresponding change. This procedure enables not only enables design of peptides that will result in high structural and binding stability (i.e., the best RAPDF scores/pseudoenergies), but also enables surmounting local minima encountered during the search. Computational optimization was performed on the four regions corresponding to the best RAPDF score, and therefore the highest binding potential, within the E protein as described above to generate variant peptides sequences.",

The domain II region peptides, DN57opt and DN81opt displayed IC50 values of 8\u00b11 \u00b5M and 36\u00b16 \u00b5M (mean \u00b1 sem) respectively, while no inhibition of infection was observed with the fusion region peptide, DN80opt.

The most active inhibitor, DN57opt was chosen for further study. A scrambled version of DN57opt (DN57optscr) did not display inhibition at any concentration tested (Figure 2B). Four de novo designed peptides, 1OAN1, 1OAN2, 1OAN3, and 1OAN4 were also tested for inhibitory activity using the same FFU reduction assay (Figure 2C). 1OAN1 was found to be an effective inhibitor of DENV-2 infection with an IC50 of 7\u00b14 \u00b5M and a maximum inhibition of 99% at 50 \u00b5M.

Confluent monolayers of LLC-MK2 cells used in FFU reduction assays were exposed to increasing concentrations of peptide before measuring mitochondrial reductase activity using an MTT mitochondrial reductase activity assay (Figure 3). When we initially performed these assays to exactly mimic the focus forming unit assay by waiting five days after peptide exposure, we saw no evidence of toxicity at any concentration of any peptide (data not shown). However, we found that a shorter post-exposure incubation time revealed a subtle toxicity on the part of one of the peptides. Apparently, waiting more than 24 h post-exposure gives the cells a chance to recover and conceals this effect. At 24 h post-exposure, DN57opt was found to be mildly toxic to cells at 40 \u00b5M (one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's post hoc test, P = 0.0004, N = 18), so only inhibitory data using lower, nontoxic concentrations was considered.

Importantly, out of seven peptides synthesized and tested, two peptides with high activity and one peptide with intermediate activity were identified. A high resolution crystal structure of the pre-fusion conformation of the DENV-2 E [14] was used as the starting point to generate in situ energy minimized peptides. Two distinct approaches were used for the design of these peptides. First, we built upon previous work targeting DENV fusion peptide and domain II hinge regions with naturally occurring E protein sequences from these regions [9]. No inhibitory activity was found for the optimized fusion peptide region sequence (DN80opt), indicating that this region may not be a promising target mechanistically for DENV peptide inhibitors. Since an analogous, naturally occurring WNV domain II hinge region peptide was shown to be inhibitory against WNV [9], we reasoned that a more tightly binding analog of this region in the DENV E protein could be designed and might have improved inhibitory activity. This turned out to be correct, and we identified two distinct binding-optimized peptide sequences to this region with antiviral activity, DN57opt and DN81opt. This supports previous predictions of hinge region inhibitors and the proposed mechanism of fusion based on hinge region movements [11], [14], [15]. The second approach to designing peptide inhibitors was to identify peptides with non-native sequences derived from E protein regions that are highly stable in terms of structure and binding as evaluated by an all-atom scoring function (RAPDF). This identified four regions that were used to derive additional optimized peptides (Figure 1). Of the four resulting peptides tested, one, 1OAN1, was identified as having antiviral activity. This confirms the use of the sliding window RAPDF minimization approach for finding tightly binding protein ligands [23], [24]. It is perhaps not surprising that computational binding optimization increased the activity of previously inactive peptides that were based on naturally occurring E protein sequences. Naturally occurring sequences have multiple balancing selection pressures that may limit their binding stability in vivo. The combined use of primary sequence prediction tools [9] and structural optimization tools [23], [24] should be a valuable approach for finding binding partners and inhibitors for other protein targets.",

The three domains are color coded above, domain I is shown in red, domain II is yellow, and domain III is in blue according to [46]. The calculated RAPDF scores of a sliding window of 20 amino acid peptide sequences are shown graphically by vertical black lines. Four major high binding regions are predicted, from amino acids 31\u201370, 121\u2013160, 241\u2013270, and 341\u2013380, respectively, corresponding to the locations of peptides 1OAN1, 1OAN2, 1OAN3, and 1OAN4. The locations of the other optimized peptides are indicated by three horizontal black lines, amino acids 96\u2013114 is DN80opt, 205\u2013223 is DN81opt, and 205\u2013232 is DN57opt. (B) Structure of dimeric dengue E protein in the pre-fusion conformation showing locations of inhibitory peptides. Top, side, and bottom views are shown. Structures are color coded as above. Black and grey residues show the positions of the 1OAN1 and DN57opt peptides respectively. (C) Structure of monomeric dengue E protein in the low pH post-fusion conformation. Inner (interacting) and outer surfaces are shown.",
