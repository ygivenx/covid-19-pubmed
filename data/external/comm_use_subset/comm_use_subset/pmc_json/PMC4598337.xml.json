Due to the very limited findings concerning LMICs, and in order to identify elements within the context of PHLP that are implemented in those countries, additional keywords \u2013 regulation and legislation \u2013 were introduced to the review procedure. Articles were only included in this review if they dealt with legal aspects of emergency situations. An exclusion criterion was a focus on routine issues (e.g. the obesity epidemic). This criterion was used to screen all abstracts included in the study. In the final stage, the articles were grouped by themes.",

While declaring a state of emergency may facilitate waiving laws, the implications of such waivers must be carefully evaluated. During emergencies, as maintained by Courtney et al. (14), healthcare providers operate under challenging conditions that may require deviation from existing treatment protocols, necessitating the development of strategies to protect against legal liabilities. Similarly, Chan (15) argues in favour of granting legal immunity to private physicians to protect them against damage claims. Conversely, it is important to protect the vulnerable population from uncertified personnel performing beyond their capacity. According to Wang (4), this issue manifests itself more intensely in situations of cross-national mutual aid that are regarded as reciprocal gestures of goodwill, where programmes cross boundaries and achieve their expected goals quickly. Thus, it is important to define obligations and rights and to establish roles, items, and standards. Other researchers (5, 6) perceived the competency of health workers as one of the core elements of PHLP.",

Managing pandemics involves coordinating different aspects of the health and social systems. In such situations, the law, which is a small but crucial component of emergency preparedness (8, 17), assumes increased importance (18\u201320). The speed with which viruses spread makes it imperative to ensure that a legal framework is in place to delineate mechanisms for effective epidemic management, within the country itself as well as globally (17, 21, 22). Accordingly, efforts and reforms in this direction have been proposed and implemented worldwide, in developed countries as well as LMICs (17) from the United States to China (23).",

The IHR made valuable contributions in various areas, including issuing clear-cut reports from afflicted countries, integrating information from diverse sources, and monitoring unnecessary human rights limitations (26). In addition, it has become a useful decision support tool (28). However, analysis of how the IHR are applied in LMICs reveals the challenges that still lie ahead (26). The main weakness is lack of resources and the ensuing inability to meet IHR demands and develop effective public health services (16, 17, 26, 29). In addition, the IHR do not make allowances for local and cultural variability (17, 30\u201332). Wilson et al. (26) note several arenas in which IHR application needs to be strengthened, including declaring a health emergency in international scenarios and developing mechanisms to improve compliance with WHO and IHR recommendations. Kool et al. (33) noted that in order to achieve the IHR goals it is crucial to simplify identification and detection capacities in countries lacking advanced health systems. For example, it is necessary to base disease definitions on clinical signs and symptoms without the need for laboratory confirmation (33).",

Limiting individual freedom in order to protect the public health has significant implications for managing infectious diseases (19, 25, 34, 35). Preparing a legal infrastructure to administrate these situations is crucial, including declaration of an emergency situation which authorises public health officials to activate such means (19). Nonetheless, operationalising them should not be based on legal facets alone, but should rather also consider judicial aspects. Coercion may decrease the effectiveness of protection that could be achieved through voluntary compliance. It may also increase the probability of a constitutional crisis (34). Mosher (8) notes that the law's promise of protection against abuses during an epidemic offers limited space for critics worried that individual liberties will yield to national security and public health concerns. In such cases, it is important to create an alternative framework in order to voice the views of those who are socially marginalised and have been largely silenced (8).",

The need to protect individual freedom arises in all types of emergency situations, but has significant implications for the management of infectious disease outbreaks (25, 34). Turnock (36) describes two major aims of public health laws: to protect and foster public health and to safeguard the rights of the individual. In emergency situations, imposing limitations on individual rights is unavoidable (34). In the United States, in the 1905 Supreme Court case Jacobson v. Massachusetts the court sustained the right of the authorities to use penalties to pressure people to be vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic. This ruling interpreted the use of the public health authority and the way the court balanced two strong competing values: the public good and individual liberties (37). Gostin (35) argues that the resulting ethical conflict is more acute in the period preceding the emergency. However, early legislation enables legal definition of individual rights, thereby facilitating optimal actions during the emergency itself (35). According to Gerwin (34), during pandemics, governance that assures a legal balance between the needs of the public and those of the individual enhances public trust in the authorities\u2019 ability to manage the situation. By contrast, in the wake of the 2001 terror attack in the United States, the rights of the individual were significantly curtailed by a powerful government supported by legal measures (8).",

According to United Nations estimates, three-quarters of the mega-cities are located in LMICs. This global trend exposes populations to disaster vulnerabilities and is associated with a dearth of risk management infrastructures \u2013 physical, governmental, and legal (32). Nishtar et al. (38), analysing the Pakistani health system, stated that one of its strengths is its legislative activism and the federal structure of the government, which promote the health system's ability to overcome challenges. According to them (38), it is important to establish laws and regulations governing public\u2013private interactions, insurance, and e-health and thus contribute towards a coordinated, joint preparedness. Van Niekerk et al. (39) found in studying South Africa that certain laws enacted for disaster risk reduction are not implemented due to lack of funds and that laws need to be updated to ensure coordination between public and private sectors.",

This call was heeded after different emergency events that occurred during the first decade of the twenty-first century (the World Trade Center attack in 2001, the mailing of envelopes containing anthrax, the SARS epidemic in 2003, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005) (45). These natural disasters and man-made events significantly impacted US society and government (35). In addition, they demonstrated the need for a policy that would include, inter alia, a legal response defining how the health system should manage such scenarios. A health legal preparedness model was developed and adapted by the US legal and health systems. It encompasses four core components (5, 46): 1) law \u2013 the authoritative infrastructure of public health bodies that activate the public health system, 2) competencies \u2013 qualification of experts in areas common to legislation and health preparedness, 3) information \u2013 updating and publicising health laws for content experts and healthcare workers and 4) coordination between legal systems and within emergency response agencies. Current publications dealing with this model discuss researching and expanding its components (45\u201347), as well as broadening its application to situations that the health system faces routinely (44).",

Studies dealing with preparedness are designed to reveal and resolve ethical and legal dilemmas in order to promote an optimal response for future situations. In addition to extensive coverage of legal aspects dealing with pandemic scenarios (3, 19, 34, 48, 49), publications also consider the impact of PHLP on issues such as legal triage (10), motivating health workers during emergencies (2, 48, 49), human rights during crises, legal coordination of relevant emergency bodies (10), and the effect of an emergency declaration on health system management (2, 50). Hodge (19) notes that upon declaration of a public health emergency the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (2001) authorises public health officials to undertake a set of activities dealing with early detection, as well as to care for and protect public health, treat exposed or infected persons, and seek out-of-state volunteers. The declaration is defined to inform the population, through the media, using language that is cross-culturally accessible and understandable (19). All the items mentioned above reflect the creation of a legal infrastructure targeted for enhancing the US public health system.",

European Union law is based on legislation (Directives and Regulations) and decisions of the Court of Justice, which intervenes when the meaning or implementation of the legislation is unclear or fails during implementation (54). In the context of emergency preparedness, references to legal aspects focus on management of communicable disease outbreaks (21, 54, 55). Greer et al. (54) claim that the European Union's laws play a dominant role in safeguarding the population's health, as their common laws and regulations significantly affect the health system. Nonetheless, due to factors stemming from the complexity of the European Union and the variability that exists among the European states\u2019 health systems, decisions are interpreted very generally with apparently vague provisions in the treaties. As a result, legislative interventions sometimes fail to adequately promote public health. For example, Hatzianastasiou et al. (56) found that Greek laws are aligned with accepted practices of international law in the context of communicable diseases in terms of safeguarding individual rights, but exhibit a lack of coherence, clarity, or systematisation and are often perceived as incomprehensible (56).",

Fox (55) noted two methodological concerns regarding research on health policy governance and diseases.

Other researchers studied perceptions regarding public health laws among organisations involved in managing emergencies. Jacobson et al. (45) found a gap between experts\u2019 perceptions of these laws and their basic aims, leading to severe deficiencies in health system preparedness. Public health and disaster management professionals may differ in their understanding of the law (47), which hampers their ability to cooperate effectively during emergencies. According to Kaufman et al. (7), staff training is the key to bridging differences in perception between public health workers and legal advisors. Other studies dealt with legal means for motivating healthcare workers and offering enhanced legal protection against liability while reducing the incidence of harm claims during disasters and pandemics (48, 49). To deal with the lack of familiarity with legal preparedness, multi-professional panels were created to reach consensus concerning relevant issues (60, 61). In both developed and underdeveloped countries, researchers that investigated regulations and laws that activate the health system during emergencies found inconsistencies and lack of coherence (56, 62, 63).",

Regarding the high mortality rate of healthcare workers in the Ebola crisis (73), Hodge et al. (67) noted that the infrastructures must offset the risks taken by frontline personnel with a commitment to their protection. This issue came to the forefront because Western healthcare workers were evacuated, while frontline workers from affected places were not.

The acute nature of the recent outbreak necessitated imposing quarantine, isolation, and other restrictive measures, in addition to monitoring movement of travellers. However, these measures were applied excessively and, rather than proving beneficial, caused under-reporting of diagnosed patients, lowered trust in the government, and sharpened economic, political, and social challenges (68, 70, 74, 75). During this crisis, human rights violations were wide-ranging, including blockage of rural areas in Sierra Leone by the army, shooting of people who unlawfully entered Liberia from Sierra Leone, and broad-sweeping barricades in Liberia that prevented access to food, medicine, and life-sustaining services. Limiting travel from affected countries is contrary to WHO guidelines (68). Rothstein (76) noted four ethical principles that should be considered in the process of deciding whether quarantine is needed: necessity, effectiveness, and scientific rationale; proportionality and minimal infringement; humane supportive services; and public justification.",

There is a need to boost effective implementation of international regulations by these states, thereby strengthening their ability to deal with routine and emergency situations and fostering global health security. The IHR present a good starting point, although additional work is needed to find a legal framework that will strengthen the willingness of the various stakeholders with different interests to cooperate and coordinate health preparedness programs. It is recommended that the components of the PHLP model be widely adopted as a comprehensive basis for promoting legal preparedness in local health systems, backed by sophisticated methods of analysis directed at elucidating the effect of PHLP on the capacity to cope with emergencies and disasters. Further studies are needed in the context of natural or man-made humanitarian disasters.",
