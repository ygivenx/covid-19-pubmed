            "text": "Over the last several decades, a number of multi-omic experimental methods have emerged to study host-pathogen interactions [1] and other complex biological systems. These studies focus on collecting a particular type of molecule from a biological system and using high throughput methods to query abundance levels across changing conditions. These empirical methods include transcriptomics [2\u20135], proteomics [6\u20138], metabolomics [9, 10], and lipidomics [11\u201313]. Host-pathogen interactions, including immunological responses and virulence factors, represent a particularly complex biological site where multiple different types of biomolecules are known to play important roles. Therefore, some of the most critical insights and translational conclusions can be gained from combining different types of -omics-based studies. Kocharunchitt et. al. examined the response of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to varying water temperatures, emulating host interactions, by collecting proteomic and transcriptomic data and using both to query responses of a single parent gene [14]. Dapat and Oshitani linked host and viral proteins of respiratory syncytial virus based on creating networks of protein-protein interactions from pre-existing databases and then overlaying abundance data from transcriptomic and proteomic studies onto these networks to identify hubs that may alter their expression [15].",

Several multi-omic studies have reported on the fact that, globally, there seems to be poor correlation between different data types (transcriptomic or proteomic for example) that are derived from the same gene [20\u201322]. Although expression heterogeneity (batch effects) can be an important driver of poor cross-class correlation, this lack of correlation is also likely due to the regulatory processes that determine abundance of each transcript and protein (e.g. transcription, translation, degradation, etc.). Lack of correlation may also be linked to the inherent differences in querying protein levels (2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry) compared to transcript levels (microarray or RNA-seq) or in other aspects of experimental design [23].",

A number of methods exist for inferring networks based on correlation coefficient, mutual information, Bayesian probability, random forest analysis and regression analysis. Networks of related features have been made for transcriptomic analyses of pathogens [24, 25], for proteome analyses [17, 26] and for metabolomic or lipidomic analyses [27]. Such networks have been used to identify specific processes or pathways that may be responding in tandem across a range of conditions, providing insight into coordination and cross-talk in biological systems as they respond to infection. They can also be used to identify genes of high importance to the organism under analysis [24, 28, 29], predict gene function [30\u201332] or identify regulatory strategies of biological systems [33\u201335]. Networks focusing on pathogens have identified which genes may be specifically important to virulence [24, 36] and other networks have been focused on expanding this approach further by querying not only the host or pathogen but specifically interactions between these organisms [37\u201339].",

The lack of apparent correlation between different\u2013omics types (protein and transcript) described above has also emerged when networks of multiple data types are constructed. Despite this hurdle, approaches that effectively integrate data across different technological platforms and biomolecular classes are likely to become more important as multi-omics data becomes easier to generate. Platforms such as mass-spectrometry and RNA-seq also result in missing values when molecules fall below an abundance threshold, and attempts have been made to develop methodologies to incorporate these data types when building networks using mutual information scores [40, 41]. With the goal of creating improved integrated networks, we examine here a number of network inference tools using several types of\u2013omics data (mainly transcriptomic and proteomic) and identify those inference tools that create the most integrated networks, defined as those having the maximum number of edges connecting different types of\u2013omics data, termed cross-type edges. Previous studies have focused on ranking network inference methods based on accuracy and have found that GENIE3, a random forest method, created the best network in terms of its ability to link known regulator-target pairs in Escherichia coli [42]. However, there has been no corresponding analysis that systematically ranks network inference methods by their ability to create integrated networks of transcripts and proteins. We perform this ranking here and find that, in most cases, GENIE3 is also the best inference method to create integrated networks of proteomic and transcriptomic data. We show that these networks, including the cross-type edges in the network, are accurate, and we use this approach to interrogate and compare networks inferred from data derived from antibody-mediated entry of Dengue virus into cells and from receptor-mediated entry. The methods presented here provide important guidance for constructing multi-omic networks representing host responses to infection, and offer strategies for inferring networks that can act as highly accurate and robust models of cellular systems.",

            "text": "Transcriptomic and proteomic samples were collected from cells at 2, 8, 16, and 24 hours post-infection. We initially carried out functional enrichment of transcripts and proteins that showed statistically significant changes in expression as a function of infection. This showed that transcripts showing changes in expression in response to infection were enriched for processes such as cytokine signaling, TLR signaling, phagosomes, viral carcinogenesis and response to infection (S1 and S2 Tables). Proteins showing changes in expression as a function of infection were enriched for some of the same pathways as well as regulation of the cytoskeleton and antigen presentation (S3 Table). We also examined replicate and treatment variation between samples as part of a quality analysis of the Dengue dataset. Using an Adonis test we found that Treatments (virus infection, cell type, etc.) accounted for 23.6% of the differences between samples when proteins were examined and 40.7% of the differences when transcripts were examined with both of these results being statistically significant (p-value > 0.001 for both tests). In contrast, replicates accounted for < 3% of differences among samples when either proteins or transcripts were examined with neither of these results being significant (p-value of 0.858 and 0.981 respectively). Networks were then inferred for this dataset where transcripts and proteins were kept as separate nodes in the network. The same gene detected at the transcript or protein level is represented by two separate nodes in the network (though often a gene is only detected at either transcript or protein level, not both). This was done for two reasons: (1) a gene may show different expression levels as a transcript or as a protein due to post-transcriptional regulation. Combining transcript and protein levels may therefore give an inaccurate overall view of the gene\u2019s expression level. (2) Within the cell transcripts and proteins exist simultaneously and may interact with each other and affect each other\u2019s expression. To identify these putative interactions it will be necessary to also keep transcript and proteins as separate entities in a network. Initial networks using both proteins and transcripts as separate features in the network and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) as an association method resulted in an extremely low number of edges linking transcripts and proteins compared to those linking transcripts only or proteins only (S1 Fig, S4 Table). Using a PCC threshold of ~0.85 produced a network containing 100000 total edges and 5016 total nodes. Within this network, 97,396 edges (97.3%) connected two transcripts, 2592 (2.59%) connected two proteins and only 12 (0.012%) connected a protein and transcript (cross-type edges). This low number of cross-type edges persisted as additional Pearson thresholds examined, ranging from ~0.81 to ~0.96 and producing networks of 200000, 50000, 25000, 12500, 5000 and 2500 edges (Fig 1A and 1B). We next examined whether the differing scales and distributions of proteomic vs. transcriptomic data could be the cause of the lack of cross-type edges. Because of differences in the nature of microarrays compared to mass spectrometry and the downstream data analysis expression values for transcripts are generally far lower than expression values for proteins (S2A Fig). To artificially correct for this discrepancy, we multiplied all transcriptomic gene expression values by a factor of 2.6. This led to modified transcriptomic values that had a distribution and scale that was highly similar that seen with proteomic expression values (S2B Fig). However, when using these modified transcriptomic values, we found that there was no change in the number of cross-type edges inferred (S4 Table). This demonstrates that the differing scales and distributions of transcriptomic vs. proteomic data seen here are not the cause of the lack of cross-type edges and that other factors are at play.",

To explore this further we investigated other methods that may be able to create more integrated networks. Aside from PCC, other methods that can be used to link features include Spearman correlation coefficient, and those developed to infer transcriptional regulatory interactions from transcriptomic data, but are applicable to inference of associations between different data types, such as mutual information [33, 43] and random forest methods. We examined nine other network inference algorithms in addition to PCC to assess their ability to infer cross-type edges. These 10 inference methods are described in the Methods and include correlation coefficient (Pearson and Spearman), mutual information (CLR, methods from the MINET package) and random forest (GENIE3) approaches. We specifically were interested in GENIE3 as it ranked as the top performer in the DREAM5 challenge and had been used in the past to infer networks of proteins and transcripts [23]. For each method we inferred seven different networks ranging in size from 200000 to 2500 edges to evaluate the performance of methods. Networks with the same letter designation (Networks A through G) are matched by size across inference methods. Network designations, the edge cutoffs used, the sizes of networks and the number of cross-type edges are shown in S4 Table and .sif files for each network are included as a Supplementary Dataset. While a number of the mutual information based methods improved upon PCC in drawing cross-type edges, GENIE3, the random forest method, was by far the best method for creating integrated networks (Fig 2A). It was 6.9-fold better than the next best method (MINET, from the MINET package in R) when examining the largest networks. When examining small networks of 5000 edges it produced 252 cross-type edges, compared to only two for CLR, one for PCC and zero for all other methods (S3 Fig, S4 Table). Similar to PCC, increasing the threshold used to define an edge to make it more stringent led to an increase in the ratio of cross-type edges to total edges. We also found that increasing the edge threshold led to an increase in the ratio of cross-type edges drawn by GENIE3 compared to those drawn by MINET (Fig 2B), at smaller network sizes GENIE3 has an even larger advantage over other network inference methods.",

Fig 3 shows the similarity of all network pairs of the 10 inference methods we tested, with green representing higher Jaccard similarity and red lower similarity. The composition of the GENIE3 network was closest to networks made using CLR from the MINET package and the original CLR algorithm using resampling (Methods). The Jaccard similarity of edges comparing GENIE3 to these methods was 0.174 and 0.184 respectively. When examining the pattern of overlap between other algorithm pairs, two additional clusters emerge. The MRNET, MINET, and ARACNE methods from the MINET package cluster together showing Jaccard similarity of approximately 0.42. Clustering with PCC is the Spearman correlation coefficient and two other methods from the MINET package, MIM and MRNETB, the average Jaccard similarity between these methods being 0.612. There are several clusters of methods that produce similar networks, but GENIE3 produces networks that have more unique edges distinct from networks produced by the other methods.

Previous studies have graded networks based on their ability to link known regulator-target pairs in E. coli and in this study GENIE3 emerged as the most accurate [42]. However, networks provide additional information beyond regulator-target pairs and we chose a wider metric based on linking genes in the same functional group. Here, we focus on the number of edges that connect two features that are in the same functional group as determined using KEGG pathways [44, 45]. Because there is such a large difference in the ability of each inference method to infer cross-type edges, we used only transcript-transcript edges for this analysis. This approach revealed that there was moderate variability between network inference methods (Fig 4). MRNETB had the highest quality network according to this metric with a functional edge ratio of 46.1%. MINET showed the lowest functional edge ratio at 21.2% while GENIE3 was near the middle with a functional edge ratio of 31.1%. As a baseline we also examined the quality of networks where the identity of all nodes had been randomized. All of the networks improved upon the randomization, which had a functional edge ratio clustered around 7.6 \u00b1 0.012%. Importantly, the method we identified as producing the greatest number of cross-type edges, GENIE3, produced edges of approximately the same quality as the other methods. This indicates that the significant improvement of GENIE3 in inferring cross-type edges does not come at the expense of network quality. This is consistent with prior studies using GENIE3 on bacterial systems, which have also found it to be highly accurate [42].",

Increasing the edge threshold leads to networks of higher quality, although even at the least stringent threshold used in this study the resulting 200000 edge network is still better than a randomized network of the same size, showing that networks can be extremely large and still contain high quality information (Fig 5A). It should also be noted that the quality of networks followed an exponential curve as network size was decreased; networks rapidly increase in quality at sizes of 50000 edges or less. The analysis in Fig 5 examines only transcript-transcript edges, however, the specific advantage of GENIE3 is its ability to infer cross-type edges. Cross-type edges are far sparser and also are likely to be affected by biological aspects that limit correlation between transcripts and proteins such as post-transcriptional regulation and differences in experimental platform. We next wanted to confirm that cross-type edges, despite being more difficult to infer, also convey high quality functional information. We therefore determined the functional edge ratio of cross-type edges specifically in networks inferred using GENIE3. This analysis showed that cross-type edges made by GENIE3 are of lower functional quality than transcript-transcript edges. However, they are still better than edges produced in randomized network at higher edge thresholds (Fig 5B) and are therefore providing relevant information regarding the co-expression of transcripts and proteins. It should be noted that this kind of analysis, examining the functional quality of cross-type edges across edge thresholds, is impossible with all other network inference methods tested here as they simply do not create enough cross-type edges (and in many cases do not create any such edges) for analysis.",

However, specific properties of the data arising from the experimental approach used (microarray vs. mass spectrometry), with the distribution of the data, or with the missing values in one type of data also may be contributing to the observed low numbers of cross-type edges. To minimize differences among experimental platforms we next examined the effect of averaging biological replicates within the transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. We explored the effect of averaging in GENIE3 as well as in one representative of each of the three clusters we identified when interrogating network overlap (Fig 3), MINET, PCC and the original CLR_O_RS. In all network inference methods and at all edge threshold levels, we saw an increase in cross-type edges when replicates were averaged compared to being kept separate (Fig 6). PCC, MINET, and CLR showed the best overall improvement, far better than GENIE3, but this is likely because GENIE3 was already well-suited to drawing cross-type edges and there simply was little room for improvement. However, despite the increase in cross-type edges when replicates were averaged, the functional quality of these edges decreased and, in the case of MINET, CLR_O_RS and GENIE3 networks, was no higher than a randomized network (S4 Fig). Averaging replicates also reduces the total number of edges in the network. On average, edge thresholds used to generate networks of the same size as those inferred when replicates were not averaged had to be lowered by 1.6-fold. The loss of input data that is seen when replicates are averaged likely makes it more difficult to draw meaningful edges between features, leading to generally smaller networks if the same edge threshold is used. Therefore, it seems that averaging replicates prior to inferring networks using multi-omic data is not recommended.",

When determining fold change values we normalized all abundance values to uninfected controls and as a result fewer samples were used to infer the network. Mock infected samples were not included as they were used to determine fold change values for infected samples. We also used only proteins with no missing values when determining fold changes across conditions and samples. This smaller dataset contained 38 samples with abundance data for 5000 transcripts and 972 proteins. Because this dataset was different than that used above (it has fewer samples and fewer proteins) we re-inferred networks using abundance values from this smaller dataset as well as fold change values. We tested this dataset using GENIE3 as well as MINET and CLR, as they were the second and third best methods for creating integrated networks from our previous analyses. Interestingly, there was an increase in cross-type edges for both CLR and MINET when using this smaller dataset with abundance values. Despite these increases, GENIE3 was still the best method for inferring cross-type edges in this smaller dataset using abundance values (Fig 7, S4 Table). When using fold change values rather than abundance values all three methods inferred far fewer cross type edges. Using fold change data, GENIE3 and CLR were essentially equal in inferring cross-type edges with GENIE3 having slight advantage in very large (200000 edges) and very small (5000\u20132500 edges) networks and CLR having a slight advantage with medium sized (10000\u201312500 edges) networks (Fig 7, S4 Table). Both CLR and GENIE3 were far better than MINET at inferring cross-type edges using fold change data.",

            "text": "The above data shows that GENIE3 is the best method for creating integrated networks when using data from in vitro cell culture infections. We next wanted to see if this advantage held with other datasets drawn from different experimental setups and with other kinds of\u2013omics data, namely lipidomics. To do so we tested other datasets with GENIE3 as well as MINET and CLR. We first tested another experiment looking at a different strain of Dengue virus (DENV1) infecting the same cell type (U937). This experiment not only included transcriptomic data and proteomic data, as the DENV4 experiment used above did, but also lipidomic data. When looking at edges linking transcripts and proteins in this new dataset GENIE3 was again the highest performer, identifying 81 and 177 cross-type edges in 2500 edge and 5000 edge transcript-protein networks respectively compared to only 1 and 8 edges for CLR and only 1 edge in each network for MINET (S5 Fig). As this data included lipidomic data we next looked at cross-type edges in a network comprised of transcripts and lipids, here GENIE3 again performed the best, identifying 15 and 34 cross-type edges in 2500 edge and 5000 edge transcript-lipid networks respectively compared to only 1 and 13 for CLR and 3 and 14 for MINET (S5 Fig). Finally, we also looked at a network comprised of proteins and lipids. Here, the advantages of GENIE3 are not as apparent, MINET performs slightly better, though both are better than CLR. GENIE was able to infer 53 and 166 edges compared to 62 and 188 edges for MINET (CLR inferred 2 and 28 edges) (S5 Fig). We next examined other datasets that were different from infection of cells with a virus in vitro. We examined two datasets looking at in vivo infection of mice with influenza virus. With both of these datasets GENIE3 was again, by far, the best method for inferring cross type edges (S6 Fig). In addition, we examined both of these datasets specifically looking at the functional edge overlap of cross-type edges. We found, similar to our analysis of Dengue data (Fig 5B), that the functional edge overlap of cross-type edges from networks of this influenza data are significantly higher than that seen in a randomized network (S7 Fig). The fact that we see this across multiple datasets from very different experiments (human vs. mouse, in vitro vs. in vivo, various pathogens, etc.) indicates cross-type edges contain biologically relevant data and that this is true across multiple disparate datasets. We also examined another mouse dataset looking at in vivo infection with West Nile Virus (WNV). Again, with this dataset GENIE3 was the best at inferring cross-type edges (S6 Fig). Finally, we also examined a dataset comprised of transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of ovarian cancer tumors [22]. Here, each tumor represented a unique condition and we chose the 2000 random proteins with the highest variability across tumor samples based on standard deviation. We then combined this dataset with the cognate transcripts matching these proteins for which we had data (a total of 1641 transcripts). With this dataset we found that, across network sizes, there was no significant advantage in using GENIE3, CLR, or MINET regarding cross-type edges. With very large networks (200000 edges) GENIE3 was very similar to MINET and both were slightly superior to CLR. With the smallest network examined (2500 edges) CLR and MINET were slightly superior to GENIE3 with MINET and CLR each inferring about ~500 cross-type edges for this network compared to 347 for GENIE3 (S6 Fig). There were also far more cross-type edges inferred with this data set with ~22% of edges linking a protein and a transcript when examining large networks (200000 edges) and ~7% when examining small (5000\u20132500 edges) networks. While this may have been affected by including a large number of protein-transcript cognate pairs from the same gene, a similar analysis using 2000 random proteins and 2000 random transcripts also found a higher number of cross-type edges, ~20%. This is in contrast to networks examining Dengue infection where only ~3% of the edges were cross-type in a large network inferred with GENIE3 and ~5% were cross-type in a small network.",

Studies of DENV3 using multiplicities of infection similar to those used here have shown that Dengue virus can benefit from antibody dependent enhancement during infection. Non-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against Dengue virus already present in the host can increase invasion of this virus into cells of the immune system including monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages [46\u201348]. Infection by the antibody-mediated route can also lead to more serious disease development with increased suppression of host antiviral response [46]. Because of these differences in viral entry into the cell and subsequent changes in disease we examined networks inferred using only data from Dengue infection via an antibody-mediated route and compared that to a network inferred using only data from Dengue infection via a receptor-mediated route. Both transcriptomic and proteomic data was used to infer integrated networks containing 5000 edges using GENIE3, one for antibody-mediated infection data and one for receptor-mediated infection data.",

            "text": "Network centrality in biological networks is an indicator of the importance of the node (transcript or protein) to the function of the network [16, 49, 50]. Pathways with higher centrality in host response networks may be more important to the host response and/or may be more coordinated in terms of their activity. To that end, the centrality of features in KEGG pathways was compared between each network to identify functions that may have higher or lower centrality in an antibody vs. receptor-mediated network. We used betweenness, the number of paths through a network that pass through the gene in question, as a measure of centrality. Studies of centrality in networks of other organisms (including those looking at human pathogens) have shown that betweenness can be used as a proxy for importance or essentiality with genes of higher betweenness being more important [24, 29]. There were a large number of functional categories whose genes showed differences in betweenness between the two networks (S5 Table) including those responding to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4. Features that showed decreased expression in response to GM-CSF or IL-4 had, on average, a 2.2-fold higher centrality value in an antibody-mediated network compared to a receptor-mediated network. This difference was significant using a Wilcoxon rank sum test with a p-value of 0.0019 (FDR of 0.144). As with other networks inferred with GENIE3 both the antibody-mediated and receptor-mediated network were highly integrated. Within the category of features showing decreased expression in response to GM-CSF or IL-4 in each network were both proteins and transcripts and several of these had cross-type edges. To further examine the specific contribution from integrated networks made from multi-omic data with cross-type edges (as opposed to networks inferred from only one type of\u2013omic data) we also inferred the same antibody-mediated and receptor-mediated networks but using only transcriptomic data. When comparing these transcriptomic-only networks we were not able to identify any significant difference in the centrality of genes involved in CSF or IL-4. In addition, other pathways showing differences in centrality that were related to viral infection such as response to reovirus infection and cytokine response were also not found in a transcript-only network but only in a network of integrated transcriptomic-proteomic data (S6 Table). This observation, combined with the fact that both transcripts and proteins were among those involved with CSF or IL-4 showing changes in centrality, demonstrates the fact that integration of multi-omic data into a network is contributing to the biological results shown here. It is important to note that this in-depth analysis is carried out only on a single dataset and while we do see that cross-type edges contain biological relevant data across other datasets (S7 Fig) it will be of interest in future studies to examine these datasets with the level of detail we apply to the Dengue study here. This would reveal whether, and to what degree, cross-type edges can aid in the biological interpretation of networks and what they can show about response of hosts to pathogens or to other stress conditions.",

This integration does not come at the cost of edge quality as GENIE3 performs as well as other methods at linking features of similar functional roles. Network analysis is a powerful way to view complex systems such as host-pathogen interactions.

There are a number of reasons why such cross-type edges may not be as prevalent as other edges with the most likely reason being regulatory patterns of the cell that are unique to either proteins or transcripts. However, cell timing of transcription and translation as well as methodological elements of all of network inference approaches examined here may also hinder the formation of cross-type edges. When collecting transcriptomic and proteomic data from a biological system such as an infected cell, transcripts identified as highly expressed or changing their expression patterns act as templates for functional proteins that will be translated at some later time point. This is likely to be more prominent in early time points when systems are still adjusting to the perturbations of the experiment. Because of this time lag, transcripts coding for genes belonging to certain functional pathways will show their expression changes earlier than corresponding proteins of the same pathway. This lag may make it more difficult to identify instances of co-expression between transcripts and proteins of the same functional category. In contrast, transcript pairs belonging to the same functional category and protein pairs belonging to the same functional category, being expressed at roughly the same time, are more likely to have edges. This is likely also the reason why cross-type edges drawn by GENIE3 are not as accurate as edges drawn between two transcripts (Fig 5B). It may be of interest to explore methods of building multi-omic networks that attempt to correct this time lag [53]. This might be done by combining early time point transcriptomic data and late time point proteomic data. However, the challenges of combining different -omics datasets from different time points and accurately correcting for the protein translation time lag would be difficult. In addition, we demonstrate here only networks of two omics types (transcript-proteomic, lipid-proteomic, etc.). However, future analyses could infer networks of all three -omics types at once, making a potentially more robust network containing more data.",

One of the reasons for this may be the fact that, unlike the other nine methods used, GENIE3 relies on a random forest approach to generate networks. Random forest is an ensemble method that can combine strengths of many weak signals to build better models, and is therefore likely more sensitive to biological signals. It is also able to work with different types of input data and does not require linear relationships between features to establish edges (though this quality is shared by several other methods we examined). Another possible advantage of GENIE3 may lie in its ability to handle values of zero supplied as a substitute for missing values in protein data. When networks were inferred with no missing values for any protein under any condition both CLR and MINET were able to infer more cross-type edges compared to a dataset containing proteins with missing values in some of the conditions. However, GENIE3 was not affected by this difference in the dataset suggesting that this approach may also be especially useful when inferring networks from datasets with missing values, a common feature of proteomic data.",

This increase in network accuracy among smaller networks was also seen when CLR_O_RS and MINET were used. While all of the networks used here, aside from those that averaged replicates, showed higher accuracy compared to a randomized network, if edge cutoffs are increasingly made less stringent, a point will eventually be reached where the functional edge ratio is no higher than a randomized network. Examining networks made by GENIE3 suggests that this point will be reached with a network of 371535 edges (representing the top 0.77% of all possible edges). The choice of edge threshold is somewhat arbitrary but our analysis suggests that there is a hard lower limit to network size if quality is to be maintained. While making edge threshold less stringent always leads to larger networks, defining a \u201cfloor\u201d will help researchers reach a balance between the maximum number of edges and networks of the best quality.",

As we described above, MRNETB created networks of the highest functional quality when examining transcript-transcript edges (Fig 4A). Other methods also have the advantage of speed with GENIE3 being, by far, the slowest of the 10 methods we tested, taking several hours to run while the other methods, including MRNETB, ran in a matter of minutes. Among the networks tested, only Pearson and Spearman distinguish between positive and negative correlation. Among these two, Spearman was more accurate with a functional edge ratio of 46%, compared to PCC with a functional edge ratio of 36%, suggesting that it may be the superior method when integration is not needed but direction of correlation is. Choice of methods depends on experimental needs; MRNETB is fast and accurate but is poor at integration and does not determine whether nodes are positively or negatively correlated. GENIE3 makes highly integrated networks but is slow and again does not determine whether nodes are positively or negatively correlated. Spearman does determine whether nodes are positively or negatively correlated and is fairly accurate but is very poor at integration. It is also important to point out that the dataset we have here, containing nearly 100 datapoints is actually somewhat small compared to other studies using network inference. While there have been several studies that use datasets of a size similar to ours or smaller [54\u201356] most studies contain many hundreds of samples. It will be of interest to determine how the choice of network inference method, particularly the use of GENIE3, may be affected by very large sample sizes. It is also likely that autocorrelation may exist in these samples as they are collected from a relatively short time frame. However, since all of the methods are compared across the same datasets if autocorrelation is present it would affect all network inference methods equally.",

            "text": "The advantages of GENIE3 may be less useful when examining multi-omics data from different experimental setups, specifically in vivo datasets or multi-omic data where both\u2013omics types are drawn from a mass-spectrometry technology. Here, multi-omics data from short term, in vitro, time course experiments led to far fewer cross-type edges compared to clinical data collected directly from patients. There are likely many reasons for this but it may be related to the high amount of sampling during in vitro experiments compared to clinical data, with in vitro experiments collecting several samples over a matter of hours rather than over weeks or months as is often the case with clinical data. This increased sampling, used with in vitro experiments, may capture cell responses as they are initially responding to stress perturbations with many regulatory signals happening over a short time frame and leading to more discrepancies between cognate transcript-protein pairs. The resulting paucity of cross-type edges amplified the advantage of GENIE3, making this method the only choice for this data type in creating networks with a significant number of cross-type edges. In contrast, data collected from clinical experiments is over a much longer time frame or, in some cases, only a single sample is collected. In this second case regulatory pathways controlling transcript and protein expression may have more time to converge, leading to more correlation in the expression and regulation of cognate transcript-protein pairs, more cross-type edges and the option of using other network inference tools. It may also be that uniform nature and response of cells used in in vitro infection experiments may expose and amplify differences between proteins and transcripts. In contrast, samples collected from patients and tumors are a mixture of cell types and responses, which may smooth out inherent differences between transcripts and proteins and lead to more cross-type edges. It is also possible that autocorrelation, which exists in many of the in vitro datasets examined here but not the in vivo tumor sets may also contribute to the larger number of cross-type edges seen with GENIE3. When examining such clinical data, GENIE3 is no better or worse with regard to cross-type edges than other methods of inferring networks such as CLR and MINET. It should be noted that all three of these methods are still superior to correlation based methods such as Spearman or Pearson. GENIE3 and MINET also find approximately the same number of cross-type edges when examining a proteomic-lipidomic dataset. The fact that a similar result emerges with these two methods only when examining proteomic- lipidomic data, and not proteomic-transcriptomic data or lipidomic-transcriptomic data, suggests that the advantages of GENIE3 may be in linking multi-omic data across different methodological platforms. When one kind of multi-omic data comes from a mass spectrometry platform and one kind comes from a microarray platform (such as proteomic-transcriptomic data or lipidomics-transcriptomic) GENIE3 is by far the best option. However, when both\u2013omics types come from a mass spectrometry platform (such as proteomic-lipidomic) then MINET is able to identify slightly more cross-type edges compared to GENIE3. This suggests that when examining two\u2013omics types that are both mass spectrometry based (proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, phospho-proteomics) MINET may be another viable option. It is important to note however that GENIE3 was able to infer a higher functional edge overlap than MINET and thus may be more accurate.",

While future directions will focus on increasing cross-type edges further and in using network approaches to examine other aspects of viral infections these experiments provide some of the first systematic ranking of methods used to create integrated networks and lay out strategies for how to infer them and which specific methods to use.",

            "text": "Networks were inferred using 10 feature association metrics that were chosen based on several criteria. We chose to use methods that had been used in the past to infer networks [23, 66\u201368], we chose methods that used a variety of mathematical approaches to infer networks such as mutual information, correlation, and random forest, and we chose methods that had previously been examined in the DREAM5 challenge based on ranking networks by their ability to link known regulator-target pairs in Escherichia coli [42]. The inference methods chosen were Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), Spearman correlation coefficient, Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR), a mutual information based metric [33], six additional mutual information methods in the MINET R package (ARACNE, CLR, MIM, MINET, MRNET, MRNETB) [43], and GENIE3, a random forest method that computes the links between each gene p and all other genes j-p as a function of the predictive nature of j-p on p [69]. Note that the MINET implementation of CLR is somewhat different than the original implementation described by Faith, et. al. [33], so was included here as a related, but distinct, method. The original method uses a binning step to transform continuous expression values in to categorical values before calculation of mutual information and Z-score, the MINET implementation removes this binning step. We also use a resampling approach on the original method [70] that is not used in the MINET implementation. Briefly, this resampling approach consists of inferring several incident networks after randomly removing 20% of the data columns. A consensus network was then made from these incident networks that averaged Z-scores, this consensus network was used for downstream analysis. This resampling with the original CLR algorithm is referred to as CLR_O_RS here to distinguish it from the CLR program used in the MINET package. Transcripts and proteins were preserved as independent nodes in all networks. For each method a threshold was used for each network to define an edge, pairs of features with edge weights above this threshold were included in the network with an edge drawn between them. Once edges were determined to be above the threshold and included in the network all edges were considered equivalent (unweighted). Thresholds used to define edges were chosen for each inference method so that networks of identical size could be compared. Networks ranged in size from 200000 to 2500 edges, representing the top 0.42 and 0.005% of all possible edges respectively (S4 Table). For all networks transcripts and proteins were kept as separate nodes in the network, the same gene can be represented by either a transcript or a protein (or both) and each of these is a unique node in the network. We also inferred additional networks using transcriptomic and proteomic data from other studies. These include a publically available dataset of in vivo infections of mice with West Nile Virus (WNV) (GEO Accession numbers: GSE77192, GSE77193 and GSE78888), publically available datasets of in vivo infections of mice with influenza (GEO Accession numbers GSE68946 and GSE71759) and a dataset examining tumor samples from cancer patients [22].",

Annotation of features (transcripts and proteins) was obtained from the KEGG database based on the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) [44, 45]. Ratios were determined for edges connecting two annotated features in the same functional category/all edges connecting two annotated features with these ratios expressed as a percentage. This ratio can range from 0% (no edges connecting annotated genes are those connecting genes in the same functional category) to 100% (all edges connecting annotated genes are those connecting genes in the same functional category) and is referred to as the functional edge ratio, a higher functional edge ratio means more edges linked features in the same functional category and the network is more accurate. When randomizing networks for this comparison an identical node-degree distribution was used and only the identity of the individual nodes was shuffled.",
