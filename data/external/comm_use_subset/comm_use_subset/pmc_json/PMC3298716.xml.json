Although most known tumor antigens can generate cancer-specific immune responses, they are either poorly immunogenic or functionally non-immunogenic, and may not elicit immune responses sufficient to eradicate tumor cells [1]. Therefore, efforts to enhance TAA-mediated host immunity towards tumors are being made by exploring a variety of adjuvants for immunotherapy, adjuvants for cancer vaccines such as highly-immunogenic vectors, combinations of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules, or immune-stimulatory cytokines usually being employed [2]. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a well-known and over-expressed TAA in most human colon carcinomas, and vaccination with CEA has been demonstrated to induce, although with only minor effects, both humoral and T-cell responses [3]. In order to magnify the CEA-mediated tumor-specific immune activities, co-administration of CEA with other immune-response enhancers such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [4] or interleukin (IL)-12 [5] has yielded promising results with regards to the activation of cellular and humoral CEA-specific immune responses.",

Using these methods, we sought to demonstrate the administration of a customized and efficient cancer therapy that combines any selected TAAs and immune-activating sequences using a simple drug-delivery method.

To find a low-immunogenic TAA and prevent the human TAA from activating mouse immunity, a truncated CEA peptide was used as a low-immunogenic tumor antigen in this study, the sequence of which is shown in Figure 1a. The CEA sequence was predicted to be less immunogenic by affinity calculation because its highest epitope score (CEA a.a. No. 5-13 (Figure 1a): epitope score 16) was far lower than the scores of well-known epitopes of Listeria monocytogenes (Listeriolysin O) (LLO91-99: epitope score 24; p60217-225: epitope score 27) (Table 1). A selected SARS fragment was fused with CEA, and this sequence is shown in Figure 1b. As described previously, the epitope within the CEA-SARS-CoV amino acid sequence was also calculated and compared with known epitopes in Listeria monocytogenes (LLO91-99, p60217-225). As a result, the highest score within the CEA-SARS sequence was 21 in the SARS region (Table 2), lower than the scores of known epitopes of L. monocytogenes for peptide/H2-Kd interaction. In addition, fusion of the CEA and SARS sequences did not create a new epitope with a higher score (data not shown).",

Among all bacteria, S. typhimurium is one of the most utilized to carry therapeutic transgenes. Attenuation of S. typhimurium with partial gene modifications does not affect its ability to achieve high tumor/normal tissue ratios in mouse models, and the bacteria maintain their capacity to inhibit the growth of both subcutaneous tumors and lung metastatic diseases [8]. Other modifications have also been reported; for example, the strain used in this study was attenuated aromatic acid-dependent (aro) S. typhimurium, which has been well-characterized as a carrier of various heterogeneous antigens [9,10]. These vaccine strains are capable of colonizing the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (Peyer's patches) and secondary lymphatic tissues including the spleen and liver following oral administration in mice, eliciting mucosal, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [11]. Previous studies have proven the lipopolysaccharides on the Salmonella surface enable CD14+ monocytes to secrete TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6 [12,13]. Also S. Typhimurium could deliver directly into the cytosol of macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in vigorous antigen-specific CD8+ T cell priming and the induction of protective immunity against viruses, bacteria and tumors [14,15].",

            "text": "Variations in the cytokine profiles arose after vaccination with pCEA-SARS-CoV. As a highly-immunogenic peptide, treatment with SARS-containing epitopes has elicited a striking increase in TNF-\u03b1 expression as compared with the negative control and the CEA group (Figure 2a). TNF-\u03b1 is a proinflammatory and Th1 cytokine, and as indicated by Austin and colleagues, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-2 can be used to define cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Th1 effector populations [16]. Reducing local expression of TNF-\u03b1 was found to be associated with B16-F10 melanoma outgrowth in mice while s.c. administrating TNF-\u03b1 significantly suppressed primary tumor growth of melanoma [17]. IL-10, a typical Th2 cytokine, was enhanced in the pCEA-SARS-CoV group as compared with the negative control and the CEA group (Figure 2b). Though most often known as a Th2 cytokine, IL-10 is actually a pleiotropic cytokine with anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and immunostimulatory properties [18], and exerts immunostimulatory effects on B cells, cytotoxic T-cell development and thymocytes [19]. As indicated by Wogensen et al., expression of an IL-10 transgene by insulin-producing pancreatic cells led to the accelerated onset of diabetes in NOD mice [20,21], with no inhibition of immune-mediated destruction of islets [22].",

Consequently, the expression of IL-10 in our model may exert not only a Th2 effect but also a Th1 effect. In general, the CEA antigen only induces a Th2 response, whereas the addition of a SARS fragment helps to induce and enhance both Th1 and Th2 responses. Th1 is more famous for its antitumor effects, although Th2 responses have been reported in autologous tumors, T-cells from patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas frequently exhibiting an activated but apoptosis-prone phenotype [24]. It may seem that the Th2 response might downregulate the effect of a Th1 response or contribute less to the antitumor activity, but Th2-dominated antitumor immunity has also been observed in some models. As reported by Chu et al. [25], their DNA vaccine, which comprised a modified core peptide of mucin1 (PDTRP) and a GM-CSF coding sequence at the C-terminus, induced better protection against tumor challenge, and that protection was correlated with type 2 immune responses manifested by an increased IgG1 to IgG2a antibody ratio and greater induction of GATA-3 and IL-4 mRNA than of T-bet and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in spleen cells of vaccinated mice.",
