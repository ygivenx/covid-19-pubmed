            "text": "Rapid sequencing and phylodynamic tracking of viral and bacterial isolates have recently become a staple in tracking viral transmission and outbreaks. In the past 5 years, multiple collaborative efforts and wet-lab protocols have been described to obtain clinical materials and sequence whole genomes in hours to days (Carroll et al. 2015; Greninger et al. 2015b; Park et al. 2015; Quick et al. 2016; Kozyreva et al. 2017). These efforts range from international pandemics and smoldering state/providence-wide surveillance to local hospital-acquired or ward-based outbreaks (Gardy et al. 2011; Snitkin et al. 2012; Gire et al. 2014; Carroll et al. 2015; Roach et al. 2015; Greninger et al. 2015c; Kozyreva et al. 2016; Naccache et al. 2016; Thomson et al. 2016; Greninger et al. 2017b, c; Grubaugh et al. 2017). The use of genomic data in bacterial food-borne outbreaks has been associated with a faster determination of source and fewer persons associated with each outbreak (Jackson et al. 2016). Although the need for genomic data from infectious pathogens on a clinical level is limited, it is clear that we are at the beginning of a new age of infectious disease surveillance and response with great interest in \u2018friction-free\u2019 approaches to data sharing (Gardy et al. 2015). Whereas 5 years ago, there was little to no whole genome sequencing performed in public health laboratories, now more than 4,000 food-borne bacterial isolate genomes are uploaded each month to the Food and Drug Administration GenomeTrakr database by public health laboratories (Allard et al. 2016). Clinical labs and researchers can digitize stocks of virus at a cost of tens of dollars per isolate, unlocking novel pathogen biology at a local level (Greninger et al. 2015a, 2017a,d; Ogimi et al. 2017). Publicly deposited pathogen genomic data and metadata are forever available and searchable online, cumulatively adding to the world\u2019s database of descriptive infectious diseaes epidemiology.",

            "text": "As the ease and rate of genomic data deposition has grown, pathogen metadata has become increasingly important. When depositing a viral or bacterial isolate sample for a clinical or host associated sample, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioSample database requires organism name, strain/isolate name, collection location, collection date, isolation source, host disease, and latitude and longitude, but also allows for deposition of host age, host sex, host health state, host description, and antibiotic resistance metadata among other specimen identifiers (Federhen et al. 2014). Although privacy concerns for infectious pathogen genomic data and metadata are less than those associated with human genomic data, there are still considerable privacy issues at hand (Lippert et al. 2017). Naturally, pathogen metadata directly comes from patient metadata. The ability to impute human relations via pathogen genomic data and phylodynamics also raises serious privacy concerns as to what constitutes protected health information (PHI). Because pathogen sequence includes a positive clinical testing result by definition, pathogen metadata can be considered clinical metadata. The desire to build better phylodynamic models creates a demand for increasing amounts of pathogen metadata with higher resolution. Higher resolution of analysis corresponds to greater precision in identifying subjects. In addition, the number of laboratories sequencing isolates, depositing metadata, and participating in phylodynamic analyses is rapidly increasing and many laboratories may not be as aware of potential privacy concerns. Setting standards in this area is now especially critical.",

For pathogens that evolve in days to weeks, providing only the year of collection based may lead to less precise predictive evolutionary models which lessen their public health impact.

For instance, if a patient had one sample taken on Day 1 for two viral tests and then another sample was collected the next day for three bacterial tests this would translate into two data points where the sample was taken on Day 1 and one data point on Day 2. The data were then quality-controlled by removing all entries that had any empty or nonsensical values for any of the kept metadata (e.g. alphanumeric strings for admission date or unknown patient sex). Chart review of these entries revealed that they were the result of clinical staff competency testing. These entries were subsequently removed from further analysis. We then removed all testing for which the collection date occurred after the discharge date or before the admission date, as all sample collections should be made between an admission date and discharge date for a given clinical encounter. The above quality control steps were decided upon after chart review of select outliers revealed that the above criteria were also highly likely to be associated with reference lab testing; therefore, we also removed all reference lab testing due to inability to confidently assign admission dates to samples sent from outside hospitals. We also quality-controlled the data by examining outliers such as the longest patient stays for ED and outpatient settings. The long patient stay lengths were all valid, and the ED stays were in all cases boarding patients in the ED due to bed unavailability based on chart review.",

The distribution of this subset of viral positives was significantly different compared with all virus testing (D = 0.373, P = 4.86e-11). A likely explanation for this phenomena is the increased prevalence of positive samples being collected in the outpatient setting (83.5%) as compared with in the larger dataset (53.1%). These discrepancies can likely be explained by continued monitoring and sampling of patients with chronic viral infections. For example, outpatient clinics may perform routine viral load monitoring in the setting of chronic viral infection. Thus, by examining all viral tests and not just positives we are likely biased toward larger discrepancies between collection date and admission date.",

Sequencing of clinical microbiological samples has been used to rule-in or rule-out infectious diseases through metagenomics, to detect antimicrobial or antiviral resistance, and to impute the transmission source (e.g. to rule-in or rule-out hospital-acquired outbreaks) (Capobianchi, Giombini, Rozera 2013; Greninger et al. 2015a, 2017b,c; Grubaugh et al. 2017; Naccache et al. 2014, 2016; Simon-Loriere et al. 2015). In this way, sequence data that is obtained for detection of antimicrobial resistance to inform direct patient care can also be used for public health measures and infection prevention. Based on the continuing logarithmic growth of data available in Genbank and other NCBI databases, we foresee a future of rich infectious disaese genomic databases that allow imputation of local and global transmission relationships of pathogens, limited chiefly by the evolutionary rate of the organism in question. The emergence of these data creates a pressure for clinical laboratories to share sample metadata, and a demand for community guidance as to the manner in which such clinical metadata can appropriately be shared. Indeed, the question posed here originated from a local decision by our clinical laboratory and IRB to follow the Safe Harbor method of de-identification for samples sequenced in the clinical laboratory and to deposit only year data for sample collection dates (Ogimi et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Our study is limited in that our simple model effectively only uses one or two variables to impute admission date. We sought only to show that PHI was readily imputable from sample collection dates. These results do not indicate whether these patients are in fact identifiable nor how much metadata is required to make them identifiable. Indeed, we did not attempt to use this information to identify actual individuals in this study. Nor have there been many studies on the re-identifiability from admission date, as there have been on date of birth (Golle 2006; Benitez and Malin 2010; Sweeney 2013). The answer to these questions often changes over time as increasing amounts of identifiable metadata become available (Liu, Musen, and Chou 2015). We also did not take into account reference laboratory testing due to inability to confidently ascertain admission dates from outside hospitals. As many clinical laboratories do not run large reference operations, it was unclear what generalizibility these data would offer to other laboratories. Our vantage point is also biased by a focus on the United States clinical testing and HIPAA Privacy Rule. Most recent phylodynamic analysis has been performed outside the United States where rules associated with patient data privacy may be interepreted differently (Faria et al. 2016). Indeed, assuming a predictable evolutionary rate for a given pathogen, one may be able to use phylodynamic modeling accurately impute the collection dates from samples where data was obscured to comply with local privacy and IRB requirements (Dudas et al. 2017).",

Metadata deposition into large centralized databases for research purposes is one of a host of ethical issues associated with communicating patient data and metadata. Although academic journals increasingly require direct patient consent to publish case reports, pathologists are encouraged to post interesting histopathology, gross tissue, or laboratory medicine (e.g. Gram stain, blood smear) images on social media to enhance their own personal brand as well as that of a profession that is often found in the hospital basement (Crane and Gardner 2016; Brissette et al. 2017; Isom, Walsh, and Gardner 2017).

Two-sample KS testing was performed on all cumulative distributions. Bacteria compared with viruses was significantly different across all locations (P < 2.2e-16).
