The family Arenaviridae comprises a single genus (Arenavirus) that contains at least 25 members [2]\u2013[4]. Arenaviruses have been classified into two antigenically and geographically distinct groups, the Lassa-lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex (\u201cOld World arenaviruses\u201d) and the Tacaribe serocomplex (\u201cNew World arenaviruses\u201d) [5]\u2013[7]. The New World (NW) arenavirus cluster is subdivided into clades A, B, and C. In addition, several North American viruses are recombination products of clades A and B (A/B) (Figure 1). All NW arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans are in the B clade. These include the Jun\u00edn (JUNV), Machupo (MACV), Guanarito (GTOV), and Sabi\u00e1 (SABV) viruses, which respectively cause Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan, and Brazilian hemorrhagic fevers with high (10\u201330%) case fatality rates [2],[8],[9]. A novel NW clade B arenavirus, Chapare virus, was recently isolated from a fatal case of hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia [3].",

The ability of NW clade B arenaviruses to cause disease in humans correlates with the utilization of human TfR1, a molecule that has several properties favorable to arenaviral replication and viral hemorrhagic fevers; it is rapidly endocytosed into acidic compartments, expressed on endothelial cells, and upregulated on rapidly dividing cells including activated lymphocytes [34]\u2013[38].

It remains to be shown, however, if these nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses could use the TfR1 orthologs of their principal host animals. Here, we confirm that AMAV and TCRV do not use human TfR1, and show that they nonetheless efficiently use the TfR1 orthologs of their respective animal hosts, N. spinosus and A. jamaicensis. We also show that mutation of one residue converts human TfR1 into an efficient receptor for TCRV, and replacement of four residues with those found in N. spinosus TfR1 converts human TfR1 into an efficient receptor for AMAV. These data show that TfR1 has an important role in the replication of nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses, and suggest that subtle changes in the GPs of TCRV and AMAV might adapt them to use human TfR1.",

AMAV, however, does not use human TfR1 as a cellular receptor. We sought to determine if animal orthologs of TfR1 could support entry mediated by the GPs of AMAV and TCRV. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the human, mouse, rat, feline, canine, Calomys callosus (Cc ; MACV host), Calomys musculinus (Cm ; JUNV host), or Zygodontomys brevicauda (Zb ; GTOV host) orthologs of TfR1. TfR1 expression was assessed by flow cytometry using an antibody directed against a flag tag added to the C-terminus of each ortholog. In parallel, aliquots of the same cells were infected with AMAV or TCRV pseudoviruses. As these viruses readily enter CHO cells using a TfR1-independent pathway, pseudoviruses were diluted to minimize background entry. Pseudovirus bearing the GP of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was used as a control. As shown in Figure 3A, infection by AMAV and TCRV pseudoviruses was significantly enhanced by the introduction of ZbTfR1 into CHO cells, while AMAV pseudovirus entry was enhanced to a lesser degree by CcTfR1. The entry of AMAV pseudovirus was also enhanced by feline TfR1 expression. We and others have previously shown that this TfR1 ortholog is also used efficiently by the pathogenic viruses MACV, JUNV and GTOV [39],[40]. The entry of LCMV pseudovirus was unaffected. We repeated these experiments using HEK293T cells, and obtained similar results (Figure 3B).

The expression levels of TfR1 orthologs were assessed in parallel using an \u03b1-flag antibody. As shown in Figure 4A, while the expression levels of all TfR1 orthologs were comparable (left panels), AMAV-GP1\u0394-Ig bound cells expressing NsTfR1, but did not bind cells expressing AjTfR1.

This loop includes tyrosine 211, which is essential for MACV, JUNV, and GTOV to use human TfR1 [39]. We compared the sequences of ZbTfR1, NsTfR1, and AjTfR1 in this region with that of human TfR1, and found several differences between human and animal TfR1 (Figure 6A and 6B). We sought to determine whether replacing the human TfR1 residues with their equivalents from animal TfR1 orthologs would allow the modified human TfR1 to serve as a receptor for AMAV and TCRV pseudoviruses. Figure 6A shows a panel of eleven human TfR1 variants that were examined. In the first two variants (zh1 and zh2), residues from human TfR1 were replaced with those from ZbTfR1. Four variants (ah2 through ah5) include residues from AjTfR1, and five variants (nh2, nh4, nh5, nh7 and nh8) include NsTfR1 sequence. These variants were expressed in HEK293T cells, and the cells were incubated with TCRV or AMAV pseudoviruses. A variant (zh1) containing two alterations - R208G and \u0394V210 - was an efficient receptor for TCRV (Figure 6C). As expected from comparison with zh1, a variant (ah2) containing three AjTfR1 residues in place of human TfR1 residues 208\u2013210 (R208G, L209A, and V210G) was a functional receptor for TCRV (Figure 6D). When mutations at R208 and V210 were individually introduced into human TfR1, the variant containing V210G (ah4) supported TCRV pseudovirus entry efficiently, while the variant containing R208G (ah3) was a less efficient receptor. Deletion of V210 (ah5), however, did not convert human TfR1 into a receptor for TCRV. A slightly larger alteration in human TfR1 was necessary for AMAV pseudovirus infection; nh5, which contains four mutations - D204N, K205S, R208G, and \u0394V210 - or nh8, which contains five mutations, were efficient receptors for AMAV (Figure 6E). The entry of VSV pseudovirus was unaffected by the introduction of any of the variants. Thus, only minimal alteration of human TfR1 was sufficient for it to serve as an efficient receptor for the nonpathogenic viruses AMAV and TCRV.",

The GP sequences of these viruses are more similar to those of the pathogenic viruses than they are to each other (Figure 1). In spite of the similarity of AMAV and TCRV to the other members of their respective subclades, these nonpathogenic viruses do not utilize human TfR1. In contrast, every clade B virus shown to use human TfR1 causes a South American hemorrhagic fever [24], [32]\u2013[35]. There is thus a close correlation between use of human TfR1 and the ability of a NW arenavirus to cause severe human disease. A possible exception is the Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV), a NW clade A/B arenavirus that does not appear to use human TfR1, but is tentatively associated with three human fatalities in 1999\u20132000 [45],[46]. Follow up studies by the CDC, however, failed to find any evidence of WWAV infection in the human tissues mentioned in the original article (Nichol, personal communication). In addition, there have been no further reports of WWAV infection being associated with human disease.",

As with the pathogenic clade B viruses, AMAV and TCRV utilized most efficiently the TfR1 ortholog of their natural hosts.

We swapped residues in a loop in the apical domain of TfR1 that is a key determinant of host specificity (Figure 6). Surprisingly, alteration of a single residue (V210G, ah4) allowed human TfR1 to efficiently support the entry of TCRV pseudovirus, while replacement of four residues in this loop with the corresponding residues of NsTfR1 (nh5) was necessary to support efficient infection by AMAV pseudovirus (Figure 6D and 6E). Although these alterations are made to the receptor, it is reasonable to infer that similarly modest changes in the arenaviral GPs would also permit efficient use of human TfR1. For example, in order to bind human TfR1, TCRV GP would only need to acquire mutations that accommodate V210, present in human TfR1 but absent or replaced by a glycine in animal TfR1 orthologs. Our data, although limited, suggest that small alterations in the arenaviral GP could convert these nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses into human pathogens.",

Similarly, the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans is thought to require as few as two amino acid substitutions in the influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA). These mutations allow HA to bind its human receptor, \u03b12,6 -linked sialosides [48],[49]. Structural studies of the SARS-CoV and influenza A virus entry proteins in complex with their respective receptors have helped to identify and predict entry protein alterations that contribute to the ability of these viruses to cause human disease [48],[50].

Although TCRV was isolated from bats [19], the suggestion that Artibeus species bats serve as the natural hosts for TCRV has been questioned [53]. Our observation that AjTfR1 is an efficient receptor for TCRV, and also for JUNV and MACV, supports a role for bats in sustaining the replication of arenaviruses. Ecological surveys of bats for novel arenaviruses are thus warranted, and may afford further insight into the diversity of arenaviruses. In addition, although cats experimentally infected with MACV do not become ill [54], viral titers in these animals were not determined. The finding that feline TfR1 supports the entry of AMAV and the pathogenic clade B arenaviruses thus highlights a possible role for cats in serving as intermediate hosts in the transmission of NW arenaviruses to humans [39],[40].",

Indeed, certain strains of the Old World arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) use both \u03b1-dystroglycan dependent and independent pathways to infect cells [55].

These fragments were cloned into a previously described pcDM8-based plasmid containing the CD5 signal sequence and the Fc region of human IgG1 [58]. MACV (Carvallo strain), JUNV (MC2), and GTOV (INH-95551), GP-expressor plasmids have been described previously [32]. Genes for AMAV and TCRV GP are gifts from Stefan Kunz (University of Lausanne, Switzerland); they were PCR amplified from infected Vero cells, and cloned into pCAGGS expression vector. The sequence of AMAV GP is the same as BeAn 7063 strain (GenBank AF512834), and that of TCRV has a deletion spanning amino acid residues 121\u2013132, and substitutions at three residues, I134A, G418S and E458R, compared to GenBank NC_004293.",
