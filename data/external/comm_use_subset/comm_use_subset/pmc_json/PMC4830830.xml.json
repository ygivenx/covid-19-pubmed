            "text": "Nanomechanical sensors have been attracting great attention because of their versatility. For example, they can detect diverse chemical species ranging from gaseous to biological molecules, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), DNA, and proteins (Barnes et al., 1994; Gimzewski et al., 1994; Thundat et al., 1994; Buchapudi et al., 2011). Detection of bioorganisms such as viruses and bacteria has also been reported (Buchapudi et al., 2011). Since the first demonstration of nanomechanical sensing in 1994 (Gimzewski et al., 1994), cantilever-type sensors with optical read-outs have been widely used. In 2011, a membrane-type surface stress sensor (MSS) was developed and achieved both high sensitivity and small size by means of structural optimization with chip-integrated piezoresistive read-out (Yoshikawa et al., 2011). This MSS platform also demonstrated the detection of proteins using a simple dipping system that is compatible with a standard 96-well plate for practical assays (Hosokawa et al., 2014).",

If a cantilever is covered with a very thin receptor layer (tc\u226b tf and wc = wf), Equation (1) reduces to the following equation, which is known as the Stoney's equation (Stoney, 1909):\n(3)\u0394z=3(1-\u03bdc)l2Ectc2\u03c3surf,\nwhere \u03c3surf is the surface stress defined as \u03c3surf = \u03c3f \u00b7 tf, and \u03c3f = \u03b5f \u00b7 Ef/(1 \u2212 \u03bdf). However, the application of these models is limited to analytically simple problems. To investigate more complex systems, FEA is an effective option, providing numerical solutions.

We investigated the deflection of a silicon cantilever with dimensions 500 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 1 \u03bcm as shown in Figure 1A. A fixed constraint was applied on one end (fixed-end). The receptor layer with a thickness of t \u03bcm is coated on the cantilever. A particle with a radius of 0.1 \u03bcm is embedded in the receptor layer with a depth of h \u03bcm, applying a constant pressure p Pa at the interface (Figure 1B). To simulate such a situation, we set a dent on the receptor layer with a boundary load of p Pa at the surface. The dent is located at l \u03bcm from the fixed-end. We investigated the deflection; the displacement of the free-end of the cantilever (Figure 1C). In the case of MSS, the diameter and the thickness of the membrane are set at 500 and 2.5 \u03bcm, respectively, with a t-\u03bcm-thick receptor layer on it (Figure 2A). The dent is also placed on the receptor layer (default position is set at the center) to simulate the adsorption of a particle.

This result suggests that the dependence of the deflection on the other parameters is not affected by p. We confirmed this condition by investigating the dependence on the other parameters while varying p. Figures 3B,C show the dependence on l, showing a natural consequence of simple mechanics: a particle adsorbed near the end of the cantilever leads to a larger deflection. The depth of the dent which corresponds to the embedded depth of a particle strongly affects the deflection. Figure 3D shows the deflection as a function of dent depth h with a nonlinear relationship. Since the data in Figure 3D can be fitted well with the quadratic function, the deflection is found to be related with the projected area of the dent s [s = \u03c0 (2rh\u2013h2), where r is a radius of a particle], rather than the surface area of the dent S (S = 2\u03c0rh).",

Figure 5A depicts \u0394Rtot/Rtot as a function of p, showing a linear relationship over a wide range. Same as a cantilever-type sensor, variation in p is found not to affect the dependence on other parameters in the case of MSS as well. Figure 5B shows the dependence on the position of the dent. It has been found that a higher signal can be obtained when a particle adsorbs near the center of the membrane. An interesting feature of MSS is that it is more robust in position of the dent compared to cantilever-type sensors. In the case of cantilever-type sensors, a dent at l = 450 \u03bcm causes ~60 times larger deflection than a dent at l = 50 \u03bcm. On the other hand, the signal caused by a dent at the center of MSS is not 10 times larger than the signal caused by a dent at 50 \u03bcm from the edge. This result indicates that MSS is more robust in the adsorption position of a particle compared to cantilever-type sensors. The dependence of \u0394Rtot/Rtot on a dent depth h is quite similar to the case of cantilever-type sensors; a higher sensing signal can be obtained for a deeper dent (Figure 5C).",

As shown in Figure 6B, Poisson's ratio does not significantly affect \u0394Rtot/Rtot when E is below 109 Pa. However, a higher Poisson's ratio results in a lower \u0394Rtot/Rtot in the case of E > 109 Pa. The simulated \u0394Rtot/Rtot as a function of thickness is plotted in Figure 6C. The behavior is similar to the case of cantilever-type sensors (Figure 4C). The receptor layer with a soft material (E < 108 Pa) exhibits little dependence on thickness, while the signal drastically decreases with thickness for a hard material (E > 108 Pa).",

Several studies reported virus detection using nanomechanical sensors. These studies fall into two categories in terms of the operation mode: dynamic mode and static mode. Nanomechanical sensors operated in dynamic mode detect viruses by their mass (more specifically, shifts in the resonant frequency; Johnson et al., 2006; Braun et al., 2009; Cha et al., 2009; Capobianco et al., 2010) while static mode operates based on the stress or strain (Gunter et al., 2003; Sreepriya and Hai-Feng, 2006; Alodhayb et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014; Gorelkin et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015). Thus, the FEA simulation in the present study can be adapted to the detection of viruses in static mode.",

Assuming that a virus of 0.1 \u03bcm in radius is embedded 0.1 \u03bcm deep into a cell, the pressure applied to the interface is estimated to be ~103 Pa. In the present simulations, the applied pressure p is set at 1 \u00d7 105 Pa (Figures 3B\u2013D, 4, 5B,C, 6), which is two orders of magnitude higher than the pressure caused by a virus. As the deflection and relative resistance changes of a cantilever-type sensor and MSS, respectively, are proportional to the applied pressure p, it is expected that the deflection/relative resistance change increases linearly with the number of adsorbed viruses on the receptor layer if the adsorbed positions of viruses are effectively regarded as constant. Accordingly, the presented simulations, in which p is set at 1 \u00d7 105 Pa, are comparable to a system where a hundred of viruses are attached to a specific position on the receptor layer. Considering that the typical detection limits for cantilever-type sensors and MSS are estimated as ~1 nm and ~10\u22126, respectively (Yoshikawa et al., 2011, 2012), a detectable signal can be obtained when ~102 of viruses adsorb near the free-end of a cantilever or the center of MSS with a receptor layer having optimal properties (t = 1 \u03bcm, h = 0.1 \u03bcm, E < 108 Pa). To compare with typical nanomechanical sensing based on isotropic internal strain or surface stress, we also evaluated the corresponding detectable sensing signals. We performed FEA simulations on both a cantilever and an MSS which are coated with poly (methyl methacrylate; PMMA); a commonly used polymer as a receptor material, which has the Young's modulus and the Poisson's ratio of 3 \u00d7 109 Pa and 0.4, respectively. The thickness was set at their optimum values: 2.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm for the cantilever and the MSS, respectively (Yoshikawa, 2011; Yoshikawa et al., 2014). The minimum isotropic internal strain or surface stress which induces detectable signals (e.g., 1 nm deflection for the cantilever and 10\u22126 relative resistance change for the MSS) has been estimated as 10\u22129 ~ 10\u22128 or 10\u22125 ~ 10\u22124 N/m, respectively.",

This is a favorable condition for practical applications because most biological materials which can interact with viruses have a low Young's modulus. For example, the Young's moduli of proteins and cells which are typically used for viral cultures are 104 ~ 109 Pa and ~104 Pa, respectively. Another advantage of using soft materials is that signals are less affected by thickness, leading to higher reproducibility for virus detection. It should be noted that the force caused by the viruses may not be fully transmitted to the cantilever or MSS membrane in an actual measurement system if the receptor layer is thick and soft. Since viscoelastic properties are not taken into account in the present simulations, signals can be reduced as a result of stress relaxation within a receptor layer.",

It is expected that selectivity will be enhanced depending on the cell types only if cells are stably maintained on nanomechanical sensors. However, the noise caused by cell migration is one of the biggest experimental issues. Bischofs et al. measured the surface stress induced by an endothelial cell and estimated it to be ~2 mN/m (Bischofs et al., 2009). Our FEA simulations showed that a surface stress of 2 mN/m leads to a sensing signal comparable to adsorption of ~102 viruses on a receptor layer. Thus, the cellular force should give rise to a non-negligible background noise. It is estimated that at least 102~ 103 of viruses are needed to obtain a detectable sensing signal when living cells are used as receptor materials.",

While the sensitivity of a cantilever sensor with an optical read-out is comparable to that of an MSS, a cantilever sensor requires a bulky instrumentation. In contrast, a compact measurement system can be realized with an MSS because of the chip-integrated piezoresistive electric sensing. Furthermore, MSS exhibits higher robustness to the adsorption position and in homogeneous coating (Loizeau et al., 2015). Thus, MSS seems to be a more favorable option for practical applications such as mobile environmental monitoring systems, point-of-care-testing (POCT) and primary screening for infectious diseases, etc. Although the sensitivity of MSS is not as high as that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which can detect ~101 of viruses (Pineda et al., 2009), MSS is a promising candidate for a portable real-time virus detection device based on its simple detection mechanism and the easier experimental protocols.",
