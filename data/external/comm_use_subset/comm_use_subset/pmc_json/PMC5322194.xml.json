Reasons for rising incidences are an increasing number of immunocompromised patients due to transplantations, cancer, and HIV infections (Richardson, 2005; Richardson and Lass-Fl\u00f6rl, 2008). It is estimated that the amount of life-threatening infections by opportunistic fungi exceeds 2,000,000 per year worldwide (Brown et al., 2012). These high numbers are accompanied by a high morbidity of patients and mortality rates of more than 40% in severely immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients and patients with acute leukemia, suffering from invasive aspergillosis (Pfaller and Diekema, 2007; Brown et al., 2012; Montagna et al., 2013). Invasive candidiasis, mostly caused by Candida albicans, and invasive aspergillosis, mostly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, are the main types of invasive fungal infections (Pagano et al., 2007; Pappas et al., 2010). However, the regulatory response of the immune system to fungal infections has not been completely understood yet.",

They originate from primary transcripts (pri-microRNAs), which are processed into hairpin structures (precursors, pre-microRNAs) by the Drosha enzyme. After export from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, the pre-microRNAs are then cleaved by the Dicer enzyme into short duplexes of \u2248 22 nt length. One strand of the duplex forms the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) together with the Argonaute protein and several other proteins (Finnegan and Pasquinelli, 2013). Guided by the microRNA, the miRISC binds to a target mRNA in its 3\u2032-UTR, thereby inducing mRNA destabilization or translational repression (Chekulaeva and Filipowicz, 2009). In a few cases, the binding can also happen in the 5\u2032-UTR or in the coding region (Moretti et al., 2010).",

They contribute to the regulation of the immune system by influencing the function and differentiation of various immune cells of both the innate and the adaptive immune responses (Gracias and Katsikis, 2011). The innate immune system, mainly neutrophilic granulocytes and resident macrophages represent the first line of defense against invasive fungal infections. Denditic cells (DCs) are key for the immune defense against fungi as they build a bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune system (Morton et al., 2011). These antigen-presenting cells are involved in pathogen recognition and are solely able to prime na\u00efve T cells in the lymph nodes, thereby determining the fate of the immune response (W\u00fcthrich et al., 2012). Thus, an extended understanding of the regulations may give rise to new therapeutic approaches in anti-fungal therapy.",

Thus, we contribute new knowledge to the role of microRNAs in the response to fungal infections. In a previous study, Monk et al. (2010) analyzed the regulation of microRNAs in murine macrophages when encountering C. albicans. In contrast, our study is directly based on human cells instead of model organisms. Moreover, we apply next-generation sequencing of small RNA instead of microRNA microarrays, which allows studying microRNA expression at higher precision and depth and enables the prediction of novel microRNAs (Pritchard et al., 2012). Das Gupta et al. (2014) examined the expression of miR-155 and miR-132 in human DCs and their in vitro precursors using A. fumigatus and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as stimuli. In comparison, we are not limited to a previous selection of microRNAs, as we use RNA-sequencing techniques. In this way, we consider all known human microRNAs and thus we may get a broader view on the regulatory mechanisms in DCs.",

(2014), it is important to filter for the most promising and interesting candidates. As shown by Eichhorn et al. (2014), mRNA destabilization is the main mode of repression by microRNAs. Therefore, we can assume that during time course of infection the expression of potential target genes is inversely correlated to the expression of their microRNA regulators. In accordance with this assumption, we used microarray data of the same conditions and time points to determine which of the target genes are significantly down-regulated, since all of the fungal DEMs are up-regulated in both time points. In a first filtering step, we kept only those target genes that show down-regulation for A. fumigatus or C. albicans. The second filtering step comprises a correlation analysis. We calculated the Pearson correlation of the microRNA expression values and the expression intensities of the filtered target genes across all samples. Genes with a correlation coefficient of -0.5 or less were retained as high-confidence targets. This correlation threshold has been used successfully in previous microRNA studies (Fu et al., 2012; Summerer et al., 2015). Applying both filters left 19 unique target genes. Some of them are regulated by multiple microRNAs (Tables 2, 3).",

However, an up-regulation of the target genes (BTN3A2, FKBP1B, KLF4, SPN, TRIM22, and IFITM2) is visible when the corresponding microRNAs are silenced. Infections with C. albicans led to an increased up-regulation compared to A. fumigatus infections for all target genes. Additionally, for the genes BTN3A2, SPN, and TRIM22, no up-regulation is visible for A. fumigatus infections with silenced microRNAs in the qPCR experiments. Although the expression differences between the silenced and the non-silenced measurements are not statistically significant, a trend toward increased expression intensities in case of microRNA silencing can be found. We further analyzed the expression changes of FKBP1B, KLF4, SPN, and IFITM2 on protein level by performing western blot experiments. Similar to the qPCR results, a trend toward up-regulation on microRNA silencing can be found (Figure 4). In contrast to the qPCR data, the increase of protein amount is higher for A. fumigatus infections than for C. albicans infections, with the exception of IFITM2.

For each of these predictions, we determined whether the 3p and/or the 5p mature microRNA has counts of at least ten in three or more samples. While seven microRNAs fulfilled this criterion, the remaining ones were discarded. In the course of this study, we name these 7 microRNAs novel_1-5p, novel_3-3p, novel_4-5p, novel_12-5p, novel_18-5p, novel_20-3p, and novel_21-3p. Five of them (novel_3-3p, novel_12-5p, novel_18-5p, novel_20-3p, and novel_21-3p) are located in introns of protein coding genes, where novel_3-3p and novel_21-3p are on the opposite strand of the respective genes. The pri-microRNA of novel_20-3p, however, also overlaps with an exon of gene WDFY4. Novel_4-5p is located in an intergenic area and novel_1-5p lies within the 3\u2032-UTR of gene DDX58 (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 3). Of the seven predicted novel microRNAs, three could be validated by qPCR experiments in independent samples. These are novel_3-3p, novel_4-5p, and novel_12-5p (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 4). We then used BLAST to compare the sequences of these three microRNAs to the known sequences from miRBase (Supplementary Table 5). The BLAST results revealed a high similarity of novel_3-3p to the sequences of the miR-378 family. Therefore, we performed a multiple sequence alignment using ClustalW to determine which of the miR-378 microRNAs is most closely related to novel_3-3p. The resulting phylogenetic tree visualizes the relations between the sequences (Figure 6). The microRNA miR-378j has the smallest distance to novel_3-3p, indicating highest similarity. Another hint for a close relation to miR-378j is the fact that this microRNA is the only member of the miR-378 family, which has no mismatch in the seed sequence compared to novel_3-3p (Figure 7). The microRNAs of the miR-378 family play a role in rhabdomyosarcoma, myogenesis, and apoptosis (Knezevic et al., 2012; Megiorni et al., 2014).",

As a first step, we identified the DEMs for each condition. When visualizing the expression patterns of the DEMs by an MDS (Figure 2) plot, we made two major observations. First, we found that the samples of the fungal species are mixed and are clearly separated from the LPS samples. This finding indicates a similar microRNA regulation in the anti-fungal response. Moreover, this response seems to be specific and different from the reaction to LPS. This indicates that microRNAs might be used as biomarkers discriminating fungal from bacterial infections which is often crucial for treatment decisions in clinical settings. Second, we discovered that for all conditions the 6 h samples were more closely related to the controls than the 12 h samples. This suggests that the regulation in consequence of the treatment was stronger after 12 h than after 6 h. One possible reason for this observation is that microRNA expression has to be induced by a trigger event, which in this study is the treatment with a fungus or LPS. This induction may not be completed after 6 h and thus more microRNAs are up-regulated at 12 h. Both of the above mentioned findings can be confirmed by the Venn diagrams (Figure 1), showing overlaps of the DEMs for the three conditions. In these diagrams, we found that the overall numbers of DEMs are smaller for 6 h compared to 12 h. Second, two peaks in the DEM numbers can be found for both time points: for LPS only as well as for A. fumigatus and C. albicans together.",

These two microRNAs are relatively closely located in the genome and member of the miR-132/212 cluster. In addition, miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p share the same seed sequence and thus may have many common target genes. In our study, we obtained a similar list of target genes for these two microRNAs (Tables 2, 3). The regulatory patterns of the miR-132/212 cluster suggest a strong involvement of these microRNAs in the anti-fungal response. However, the data also indicated that they are of no major importance for the response to LPS. It has been reported that miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p are involved into the neuron morphogenesis, are down-regulated in several brain-related disorders, and also play a role in regulating immune processes (Wanet et al., 2012). Moreover, Das Gupta et al. (2014) showed an up-regulation of miR-132-3p in DCs in response to A. fumigatus stimulation, whereas a stimulation with LPS had no effect on miR-132-3p. These observations are in accordance with our results, which supports the assumption of a regulatory function specific to fungal infections.",

            "text": "We used different tools to determine the target genes of the fungal-specific microRNAs and filtered these lists based on inverse regulation and correlation.The number of predicted target genes is much higher than the number of validated target genes. A reason is that bioinformatic target prediction tools yield high amounts of false positive results, since microRNAs are very short. Additionally, the number of validated targets is closely connected to the factor of how well studied a microRNA is. Validation experiments are usually performed for microRNAs that are relevant for a study, which therefore leads to a bias in the number of verified MTIs. In the presented results, the most immunological relevant target genes were identified for the microRNAs miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p. These microRNAs are not yet known to be of immunological significance. We performed experiments to validate the predicted interactions with these immune-relevant genes. Although no statistical significance could be found for the expression changes of the selected target genes after microRNA silencing, a trend of up-regulation among these genes was observed. However, the regulatory patterns of the PCR experiments and the western blots are contrary for A. fumigatus and C. albicans. This finding indicates a considerable influence of post-transcriptional and/or translational regulation as well as of the different stabilities of RNA and proteins. Indeed, it has been reported that the squared Pearson correlation of mRNA and protein levels is only at \u22480.4 (Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). The small extend of up-regulation suggests that the microRNAs perform a fine-tuning of the gene expression and other gene regulatory mechanisms, for example transcription factors, seem to play a larger role for the anti-fungal immune response in DCs. Nevertheless, fine regulatory mechanisms are important for controlling immune processes (Gantier et al., 2007). For example, studies have shown that microRNAs fine-tune the TLR4 signaling and the sensitivity of T cell during their differentiation (Sonkoly et al., 2008; O'Neill et al., 2011).",

To demonstrate the relevance of miR132-5p and miR212-5p in additional immune cell populations, experiments stimulating human primary natural killer (NK) cells with A. fumigatus, followed by subsequent microRNA extraction and qPCR-based quantification of miR132-5p and miR212-5p expression were performed. While expression of miR132-5p did significantly change in NK cells stimulated with A. fumigatus, expression of miR212-5p was significantly increased after 6 h of co-cultivation (p = 0.036). This observation indicates the general relevance of miR212-5p in various cell populations of the innate immunity. In addition, our previous work shows that in human primary monocytes miR-132 (and also miR-155) was differentially expressed after stimulation with A. fumigatus. Interestingly, miR-132 was induced by the fungus but not by LPS in this cell type (Das Gupta et al., 2014). Furthermore, Wanet et al. (2012) reported that miR-212 and miR-132 are expressed in various immune cells, like macrophages, mast cells and lymphatic endothelial cells. However, it remains an open task for future studies to shed light on the role of these microRNAs in other tissues and under different conditions.
