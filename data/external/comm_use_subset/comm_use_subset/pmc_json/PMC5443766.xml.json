Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which stack to form the G4. The presence of K+ cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability2. Based on the strand orientation, G4s can adopt three main topologies: parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid-type structures. In eukaryotes, G4s have been shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination3\u20137. Expansion of G-quadruplex-forming motifs has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders4, 8, 9. Formation of G4s in vivo has been consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s10, 11 and the development of G4 specific antibodies12, 13.",

G4s have been reported in the SARS coronavirus20, the human papilloma, Zika, Ebola and hepatitis C virus genome21\u201324. Among herpesviruses, RNA G4s have been implicated in the regulation of DNA replication and translation of the Epstein\u2013Barr virus25, 26. We have shown that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) possesses several repeats of important G4-forming sequences, which could be stabilized by a G4 ligand with inhibition of viral DNA replication27. In addition, HSV-1 G4s, visualized with the aid of a G4-specific antibody in infected cells12, were shown to form massively in the cell nucleus, peak during viral replication and localize according to the viral genome intracellular movements28.",

Treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with c-exNDI induced a complete inhibition of the virus at low nanomolar concentration, with a mechanism of action directed toward viral DNA replication. Inhibition of viral DNA replication impaired viral genes transcription resulting in an effective antiherpetic effect. MS competition assays demonstrated that c-exNDI preferentially binds HSV-1 G4s over cellular telomeric G4, the most represented G4s within cells, suggesting that the observed preferential antiviral activity vs cytotoxicity is mediated by both the higher amount of HSV-1 G4s in the cell and their higher affinity for c-exNDI.",

In particular, genes corresponding to immediate-early (IE: ICP22, ICP47), early (E: UL30) and late (L: UL36) proteins were considered. At 4 h.p.i., no significant inhibition of viral mRNAs production was observed, whereas at 24 h.p.i. all mRNAs were reduced to a similar extent (28\u201345%) (Fig. 4a). A similar trend has been reported for ACV36. To assess the main and temporally last viral step targeted by c-exNDI, we performed a time of addition (TOA) assay where the maximal low/mild-cytotoxic concentration of the compound was added at different times post-infection (corresponding to different viral cycle steps). The compound maintained its inhibitory activity when added up to 8 h.p.i (Fig. 4b). This is the time when viral replication occurs; indeed, ACV, a known inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase37, showed a remarkably overlapping TOA profile. These data indicate that c-exNDI inhibits viral production mainly by targeting viral replication. Inhibition of viral DNA replication was further confirmed by qPCR analysis. At 4 h.p.i no reduction in viral DNA replication and production was observed, whereas at 24 h.p.i viral DNA was reduced of about 40% (Fig. S1), similarly to what observed with another G4-ligand targeting HSV-1 DNA27.\n",

Interestingly, even if a net preferentiality for HSV-1 G4s over some cellular G4s was not observed, nevertheless c-exNDI displayed potent anti-HSV-1 activity paralleled by mild/low toxicity at the doses necessary to achieve complete suppression of virus production (Fig. 3a). We ascribe this behaviour to two main reasons: i) the massive presence of G4s during the HSV-1 viral cycle. By an antibody-based approach in cells we demonstrated that viral G4s form massively in the nucleus during viral replication28. During this step they likely control both viral replication itself and other key processes of the infection, with consequent dramatic effect when they are stabilized by c-exNDI. In fact, viral replication was here shown to be the step targeted by c-exNDI, which strongly points to the compound G4-based mechanism of action on the HSV-1 G4s. ii) The higher affinity of c-exNDI for HSV-1 G4s vs telomeric G4s. These are the most abundant cellular G4s in the infected cell: their lack of optimal recognition by the compound is likely the main reason for the observed low cellular toxicity at antiviral effective doses (Fig. 5).\n",

            "text": "Impairment of viral replication led to the decrease of viral genes in all phases of the viral life cycle. This effect is shared between c-exNDI and ACV36. We have previously shown that the general G4 ligand, BRACO-19, mainly decreased L viral genes27. This discrepancy may be due to the lower affinity of BRACO-19 for HSV-1 G4s and lower antiviral activity (IC50 in the low micromolar range)27 which would result in observable inhibition only of genes temporally more closely influenced by inhibition of viral replication. In contrast, in the case of c-exNDI and ACV, their potent effect on the HSV-1 genome is likely sensed at a more extended level. There is also the fascinating possibility that c-exNDI reacts with additional G4s, such as those in key regulatory IE and E genes; in fact, besides the extended G4 repeats in the terminal and inverted repeats27, less extended but stable G4s structures are also distributed throughout the HSV-1 genome and embedded in the promoter and coding sequences of fundamental genes27.",
