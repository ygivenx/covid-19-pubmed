In temperate regions, influenza has a clear seasonal pattern with an exponential increase in infections in the winter, which is followed by a fade-out period of a few months. In subtropical regions, there is no sufficient understanding of the seasonal pattern of influenza and its relationship with meteorological factors. The number of epidemic peaks can differ across various subtropical regions, with the peaks usually occurring at different periods within a year [1,2,3]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza epidemics result in 250 to 500 thousand deaths worldwide annually [4]. In Hong Kong, the influenza hospitalization rate and the pneumonia and influenza (P&I) associated mortality were estimated to be 29 and 4.1 per 100,000 person-years respectively [5,6]. Hong Kong was also regarded as an epicenter of pandemic influenza in Southeast Asia. Insufficient information about viral activity creates difficulties in forecasting the disease burden and thus hampers official preparation efforts.",

A small variation in influenza transmission could result in amplification and damping of infection oscillations over time and thus sustain a seasonal pattern [7]. Possible drivers of influenza transmission include meteorological variations [8], susceptible numbers [9,10], and social mixing [3]. Recently, Shaman et al. employed a mathematical model to demonstrate that the seasonal pattern of influenza in the United States could be drawn based on the process of simulations driven by the absolute humidity [8]. This finding motivated a further investigation of potential meteorological drivers for subtropical climates.",

In this model, a population is comprised of four compartments: susceptible (S(t)); infectious (I(t)); recovered (R(t)); and dead (D(t)), at each time point t. The SIR model consists of four differential equations that describes the rates of subject movements for each of the time steps. We assumed homogeneous mixing, meaning that each individual has the same chance of contacting another individual within the population. In the compartmental model, once susceptible individuals in compartment S(t) get infected, they will move to compartment I(t) and stay there for the infectious period. When the infectious period is over, the individuals in compartment I(t) will recover and move to compartment R(t) or will die and move to compartment D(t). In this model, the time-varying transmission rate per individual is \u03b2t and the force of infection for time t is \u03b2tI. We denote S(t), I(t), R(t), and D(t) as S, I, R, and D as the subpopulations in each compartment for time t. The deterministic system of equations are as follows: (3)dSdt=\u2212\u03b2tSIdIdt=\u03b2tSI\u2212(\u03b3+\u03b4)IdRdt=\u03b3IdDdt=\u03b4I",

To make the model coefficients more comparable to each other, meteorological variables are transformed by subtracting the mean and divided by the standard deviation (SD) over their sampling period. Let Xti be a particular i-th independent variable (e.g., air temperature at time t), the transformed form would be:\n(4)Zti=Xti\u2212X\u00afi\u03c3Xi where X\u00afi is the sample mean and \u03c3Xi is the SD for the sampling period.

Parameters I(0), b0, b1,\u2026,bn could be estimated by least-squares fitting to the data. As weekly data was used, t was measured in weeks. Statistically significant meteorological parameters (p-value of bi < 0.05) were declared as potential drivers to seasonal variations of influenza. A stepwise variable selection approach was adopted and the best fitted model was chosen as the one with all statistically significant variables and the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [19]:\n(6)AIC=mlog(SSEm)+2p where m is the number of data points, p is the total number of parameters, and SSE is the sum of square errors. Instead of sampling, all possible parameter combinations were assessed by a grid search. As the absolute humidity was derived from the temperature and relative humidity, they could not be included in the same variable pool during the stepwise variable selection, due to the co-linearity problem. The variable set with temperature, relative humidity, plus other variables and the set with absolute humidity plus other variables were separately adopted in the variable selection in order to draw two final models. The best fitted model was then chosen based on AIC value (lower being better). Adjusted R-square (Adj-R2) is the measure of proportion of variance explained by the model after the parsimony adjustment. The difference of Adj-R2 between the null model and fitted model (\u0394Adj-R2) was interpreted as the proportion of variance explained by the meteorological factors.",

Our study extended these findings by showing that cold temperature was associated with the mechanism driving seasonal oscillations at a population level.

One possible explanation for this is that the absolute humidity in Hong Kong was high all year around, compared to temperate areas. Like other tropical and subtropical regions, use of air conditioning is common in Hong Kong when the temperature is high. One could argue that, using air conditioning would lower the indoor absolute humidity and thus modulate the survivorship of the influenza virus.

Nevertheless, there remains no clear and definitive explanation for the mechanism of rainfall driving the influenza seasonality. Although low temperature and dry air have been proven to be favorable for survival of viral particles [22], no study has investigated the relationships between rainy conditions and bulk aerosol transport. One plausible mechanism is that rainfall could affect human social behaviors, such as indoor activities, and therefore influence the number of contacts and the risk of exposure to contaminated environments or infected individuals. In our study, we found that rainfall significantly drove some epidemics but that its direction of association was not unidirectional, likely due to the problem of multicollinearity, which has been investigated in our association analysis (Table S2).",

This result was not surprising because the effect of solar radiation on the population of the subtropics is not as well documented as in temperate regions. In addition, influenza A would be more likely affected by vitamin D status than influenza B [31]. This factor might confound our findings when P&I data was adopted in the study.

The between-season effect was made up by \u201cnuisance variables\u201d, which could result from variations of reporting rate and other potential factors that affected the susceptibility numbers [10], such as the vaccination effectiveness. Although the partial immunity of the seasonal influenza was adjusted in our analysis, some factors are difficult to measure and interpret. Analysis by seasons could confound the relationship between meteorological factors and transmission rate, and thus generate inconsistency for the estimated coefficients (e.g., a negative association of rainfall in 2007). An additional analysis was conducted using the pooled data and the results were summarized in supplementary Table S3. By this approach the main finding was unchanged (i.e., a low temperature drove the influenza transmission). It should be noted that between-season effect accounted for 20% of the total variance in addition to the meteorological determinants.",

According to some studies [8,9,10,22], some seasonal changes of host behavior (e.g., international travel [33,34] and school holidays [35]) might also affect the transmission dynamics. It has been shown that the closure of kindergartens and primary schools was able to reduce the disease transmission rate by around 25% for the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Nevertheless, its effect upon the seasonal variation of influenza is controversial. Some studies [10,36] pointed out that no substantial effect on the transmission reduction could be detected when schools were closed. In addition, our results were undoubtedly affected by the demographics of the population (e.g., age and gender). Subjects with different clinical status, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may also have confounded the likelihood of P&I deaths. The sufficiency of details to address these issues requires a huge effort in data collection, which remains difficult to achieve at this stage. Further research is warranted to investigate the effects of seasonal social/behavior patterns.",

Although some studies have preferred using P&I mortality [15], we also analyzed the P&I excess mortality to test the robustness of the study finding. We adopted the traditional Serfling approach to estimate the excess mortality [37,38]. The Serfling method is a linear regression model using harmonic terms to calculate the expected mortality in the absence of influenza virus activity. The number of excess deaths attributable to influenza was estimated as the difference between the observed and the upper 95% limit of the prediction interval of baseline deaths. The details were noted in supplementary Table S4. From the results, the principal finding was unchanged (i.e., air temperature remained a significant driver of the seasonal patterns). It should be noted that no climatic variables can be fitted into the year 2003 due to few P&I excess mortality. This might be due to the mitigation measures for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic that potentially also reduced the number of influenza cases [39].",

Moreover, some influenza B epidemics resulted in increased hospitalizations but not increased mortality [40]. As a result, our findings might be less precise for mild influenza seasons and may not reflect the general influenza experience in Hong Kong. This is a common limitation in studies that employed mortality surveillance. In addition to death data, influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance has been commonly adopted as a proxy for influenza activity. Nevertheless, the definition of ILI failed to document significant influenza-associated morbidity and mortality [5]. As such, ILI is a poor indicator of influenza activity when adopted in areas with a less defined pattern of seasonality [41]. Laboratory surveillance data would be a better indicator for influenza activity but large efforts would be required to gather and collate such data.",
