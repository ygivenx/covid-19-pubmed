Although Mn has been studied for years, the mechanism by which it causes neuronal damage is not well understood. Studies suggest that neurotoxicity is not caused by a single factor but that it appears to be regulated by a number of factors including apoptosis, oxidative injury, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation [14\u201318].",

All selected strains were then exposed to this range of Mn2+ concentrations. Figure 1 shows a comparison between the wild type strain, the disaggregase hsp104 mutant, which displays higher tolerance to Mn2+, and the base excision repair ntg1 mutant, which is more sensitive. Mn2+ at 1.5 mM was determined to be the optimal concentration for the strain comparison (Figure 1).

[18], we selected several mutant strains that play a role in the mutagenicity avoidance and may be involved in processing Mn2+-induced DNA damage (Table 1). These mutants strains include those defective in nucleotide excision repair (rad2), postreplication repair (rad18, rad27a, and ubc13), base excision repair (apn1, rad27, and ntg1), homologous recombination (rad52), DNA mismatch repair (mlh1), and DNA damage bypass (rad30), glutathione synthesis (gsh1 and gsh2), oxidative stress (sod1, sod2, and cta1), and protein disaggregation (hsp104). Quantitative analysis involved exposing the cells to Mn2+ as described under Materials and Methods and spotting serial dilutions onto nonselective media YPD for colony counting. As observed in Figure 2(a), no significant difference was observed on the growth rate of each strain in the absence of Mn2+ (control panel), except for slow growing strain ntg1. However, upon treatment with Mn2+, the strains displayed differential sensitivity to the metal. All strains tested were sensitive to Mn2+ however, only the hsp104 mutant displayed less sensitivity than the wild type (48% versus 37%; Figure 2(b), black bar). No significant difference between rad2 (33.2% survival) and the wild type was observed, suggesting that Mn2+-induced DNA damage does not result in bulky adducts that require NER for processing. Similarly, no significant difference between rad52 (31% survival) and the wild type indicates that no significant DNA damage is processed to DNA double-strand breaks that require homologous recombination for repair. Interestingly, the oxidative stress mutants sod1, sod2, and cta1, (15%, 21%, and 17% survival, resp.) were approximately 2-fold more sensitive than wild type and the glutathione synthesis mutants gsh1 and gsh2 (10.6% and 13.6% survival, resp.) were 3-fold more sensitive. Mismatch repair mutants mlh1 displayed 14.5% survival, suggesting that Mn2+ induces an increased load of mismatches that cannot be repaired. More striking was the sensitivity of the base excision repair mutants apn1, rad27, and ntg1,  (9.5%, 9.2%, and 4.9% survival), which were over 4-fold more sensitive to Mn2+ than wild type (Figure 2(b)), with ntg1 being the most sensitive (7.5-fold). In addition, ubc13 and rad30 mutants were also highly sensitive (~4-fold higher than wild type), further suggesting the generation of Mn2+-induced DNA damage.",

As shown in Figure 4, the mutation rate increased 12-fold (from 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 23.1 \u00d7 10\u22127) when wild-type cells were treated with 1.5 mM Mn2+. Based on the ability of antioxidants to reduce the toxicity of Mn2+ (Figure 3), we tested if cotreatment with NAC or GSH could also reduce the Mn2+-induced increase of the mutation rate. In fact, 20 mM NAC reduced the mutation rate by 1.5-fold (from 23.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 15.5 \u00d7 10\u22127), while 10 mM GSH reduced the mutation rate by 2-fold (from 23.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 to 11.8 \u00d7 10\u22127), consistent with the ability of these antioxidants to reduce Mn-induced toxicity (Figure 3).",

We observed a dose-dependent increase in the mutation rate of this strain with increasing concentrations of Mn2+ (Figure 5(a)). Even at low concentrations of Mn2+ (0.25 mM), the mutation rate increased by 13-fold (from 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 27.8 \u00d7 10\u22126) and was 30-fold (2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 62.3 \u00d7 10\u22126) and 76-fold (2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 160 \u00d7 10\u22126) higher at 1.5 mM and 3 mM concentrations of Mn2+, respectively (Figure 5(a)). To determine if Mn2+ was displacing Mg2+ in the DNA synthesis reaction, we tested if exogenously added Mg2+ could both increase the survival of the strain as well as reduce its mutator phenotype.

Numerous studies suggest that the neurotoxicity as a result of Mn exposure is a consequence of a variety of factors including apoptosis, oxidative injury, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation [14\u201318]. Of particular interest is the mutagenicity of Mn. Despite extensive knowledge of the DNA damaging properties of Mn, little is known about the pathways involved in the response and repair of Mn-induced DNA damage.",

We selected mutant strains in key components of the major DNA repair pathways, as described in Table 2. Initial observation indicates that yeast cells are relatively tolerant to Mn2+, displaying reduced viability only when concentrations reach over 1 mM (Figure 2), which is several orders of magnitude higher than for other metals, such as Cd2+, which is toxic at the \u03bcM level [31]. Interestingly, the sensitivity of yeast cells to Mn2+ is almost complete when the concentration of Mn2+ reaches 2.5 mM (Figure 2) displaying a linear response within this concentration window. For this reason, the strain comparison was performed at the 1.5 mM concentration. All strains displayed varying degrees of sensitivity, and all except the hsp104 strain, were more sensitive than the wild type, suggesting that no significant toxic levels of protein aggregation are induced by Mn2+.",

            "text": "Cells possess three major excision repair pathways: (i) base excision repair (BER) which is responsible for the repair of damaged bases resulting primarily from oxidative damage [34], (ii) nucleotide excision repair (NER) which plays a major role in the repair of large DNA adducts and UV damaged DNA [35, 36], and (iii) DNA mismatch repair (MMR), a postreplicative mechanism, improves the fidelity of DNA replication by removing misincorporated bases by the DNA polymerase [37]. In addition, cells possess recombination repair, which in yeast is primarily performed by homologous recombination (HR) [38]. These pathways act in concert to respond to exogenous damage and guarantee genome stability. Some of these pathways have been shown to be defective in neurodegenerative diseases [39, 40] and participate in response to neurotoxic agents [41, 42]. Our data suggests that BER plays a major role in the cellular response to toxic levels of Mn2+ as mutants apn1, rad27, and ntg1 were more than 4-fold sensitive to Mn2+ than wild type (Figure 2(b)) and ntg1 was the most sensitive (7.5-fold). NTG1 is a DNA N-glycosylase which removes the oxidized damaged base on both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA [43]. The DNA damage generated by Mn2+ appears to interfere with DNA replication, as indicated by the high sensitivity of strains ubc13, a DNA-damage-inducible gene, member of the error-free postreplication repair pathway [44], and rad30 mutants, which are defective in translesion synthesis DNA polymerase eta, required for bypass synthesis at sites where replication forks are stalled due to damaged bases. Conversely, NER does not appear to play a major role in the repair of Mn2+-induced DNA damage, as indicated by similar survival of rad2 mutant to the wild type. Similarly, the lack of a strong Mn2+-induced phenotype in the rad52 strain suggests that no significant DNA damage is processed to DNA double-strand breaks, which requires homologous recombination for repair.",

Similar to the effect on survival, NAC and GSH reduced the increase in the mutation rate, suggesting that the mutations are at least the result of oxidative damage to DNA. Analysis of the mutations in the CAN1 gene in these yeast cells indicates that most base substitutions are accumulated (70%), while 30% were frameshifts mutations. In combination with the increased mutation rate, cells exposed to Mn2+ have a significantly higher accumulation of frame shift mutations. This is distinct from spontaneous mutations (not exposed to Mn2+), where 10% of the mutants analyzed had complex mutations [29, 45]. The increase in frameshift mutations was also observed when the mutation rate was measured using the lys2-10A allele. This increase was dose-dependent and ameliorated by Mg2+, concomitant with an increase in cell survival. In fact, Mg2+ has been shown to protect cells from Mn2+ toxicity [46\u201348]. It is possible that the mutation rate increase is the result of Mn2+ intoxication of the DNA polymerase by displacing Mg2+ [21], which would require MMR for repair, explaining the increased sensitivity of the mlh1 strain.",

Considering the well-known relationship between DNA repair defects and neurodegenerative diseases, and the involvement of DNA repair in response to neurotoxic agents, the status of base excision repair, or some of its key components, may prove to be useful as biomarkers to determine the susceptibility to toxic damage from excess exposure to Mn2+. There is currently a lack of well-validated biomarkers for manganese exposure. Manganese overexposure leads to cognitive, motor, behavioral effects in children [56] and manganese is associated with Parkinson's disease in adults [11\u201313]. Persons most likely to be exposed to excessive levels of manganese are manganese coal miners and welders. However, there is currently no way to determine who will suffer severe effects after Mn overexposure. Thus, preventive strategies and biomarker development for BER status are strongly supported by our findings. An assay that monitors the BER status of exposed individuals could be used in conjunction with other recently proposed biomarkers for Mn exposure which measure delta-amino levulinic acid levels [57] and the Mn/Fe ratio [58]. While these two biomarkers can detect exposure to Mn, an assay evaluating BER status would be of more value as a preventative strategy with its inherent potential to distinguish individuals who would be more severely affected by Mn exposure from those who would not.",
