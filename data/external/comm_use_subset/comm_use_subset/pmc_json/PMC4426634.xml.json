Increasingly, the expectation is that\nreliable forecasts will be available in real time. Recent examples in which\nmodel-based forecasts were produced within weeks of the index case include severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS; [4,5]), pandemic H1N1\ninfluenza [6], cholera in Haiti\nand Zimbabwe [7], Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS; [8]),\nand lately, Ebola virus disease (EBVD) in West Africa [9,10]. In the early stages of an emerging pathogen outbreak, key unknowns\ninclude its transmission potential, the likely magnitude and timing of the epidemic\npeak, total outbreak size, and the durations of the incubation and infectious\nphases. Many of these quantities can be estimated using clinical and household\ntransmission data, which are, by definition, rare in the early stages of such an\noutbreak. Much interest, therefore, centres on estimates of these quantities from\nincidence reports that accumulate as the outbreak gathers pace.

With even the simplest models, such as the classical\nsusceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model, the choice of data to\nwhich the model is fit can have significant implications for science and policy.\nHere, we explored these issues using a combination of inference on simulated data\nand on actual data from an early phase of the 2013\u20132015 West Africa EBVD\noutbreak. We find that some of the standard choices of model and data can lead to\npotentially serious errors. Since, regardless of the model choice, all model-based\nconclusions hinge on the ability of the model to fit the data, we argue that it is\nimportant to seek out evidence of model misspecification.

Because, in such an exercise, the model itself is deterministic,\nall discrepancies between model prediction and data are in effect ascribed to\nmeasurement error. Implicitly, the method of least squares assumes that these errors\nare independent and normally distributed, with a constant variance. This assumption\ncan be replaced without difficulty by more realistic assumptions of non-normal\nerrors and, in particular, an error variance that depends on the mean. As for the\ndata to be fit, many have opted to fit model trajectories to cumulative case counts.\nThe incompatibility of this choice with the assumptions of the statistical error\nmodel has been pointed out previously [11\u201313]. In\nparticular, the validity of the statistical estimation procedure hinges on the\nindependence of sequential measurement errors, which is clearly violated when\nobservations are accumulated through time (see electronic supplementary material,\nappendix B). To explore the impact of this violation on inferences and projections,\nwe performed a simulation study in which we generated data using a stochastic model,\nthen fit the corresponding deterministic model to both raw and cumulative incidence\ncurves. We generated 500 sets of simulated data at each of three different levels of\nmeasurement noise. For each dataset, we estimated model parameters, including\ntransmission potential (as quantified by the basic reproduction number,\nR0) and observation error overdispersion (as\nquantified by the negative binomial overdispersion parameter, k).\nFull details of the data generation and fitting procedures are given in electronic\nsupplementary material, appendix A. The resulting parameter estimates are shown in\nfigure 1. ",

            "text": "To summarize, we have here shown that the frequently adopted approach of fitting\ndeterministic models to cumulative incidence data can lead to bias and pronounced\nunderestimation of the uncertainty associated with model parameters. Not\nsurprisingly, forecasts based on such approaches are similarly plagued by\ndifficult-to-diagnose overconfidence as well as bias. We illustrated this using the\nSEIR model\u2014in its deterministic and stochastic incarnations\u2014fit to\ndata from the current West Africa EBVD outbreak. Emphatically, we do not here assert\nthat the SEIR model adequately captures those features of the epidemic needed to\nmake accurate forecasts. Indeed, when more severe diagnostic tests are applied\n(electronic supplementary material, figure B1), it seems less plausible that the\nSierra Leone data appear are a sample from the model distribution. Moreover, we have\nside-stepped important issues of identifiability of key parameters such as\nroute-specific transmissibility, asymptomatic ratio and effective infectious period.\nRather, we have purposefully oversimplified, both to better reflect modelling\nchoices often made in the early days of an outbreak and to better focus on issues of\nstatistical practice in the context of quantities of immediate and obvious public\nhealth importance, particularly the basic reproduction number and predicted outbreak\ntrajectory. Figure 5 shows\nprojected incidence of EBVD in Sierra Leone under both the deterministic model fit\nto cumulative incidence data (in red) and the stochastic model fit to raw incidence\ndata (in blue). The shaded ribbons indicate forecast uncertainty. In the\ndeterministic case, the latter is due to the combined effects of estimation error\nand measurement noise. As we showed above, the first contribution is unrealistically\nlow because serial autocorrelation among measurement errors have not been properly\naccounted for. The second contribution is also underestimated because of the\nsmoothing effect of data accumulation. Finally, because the model ignores all\nprocess noise, it unrealistically lacks dynamic growth of forecast uncertainty. By\ncontrast, the stochastic model fitted to the raw incidence data show much greater\nlevels of uncertainty. Because measurement errors have been properly accounted for,\nconfidence intervals more accurately reflect true uncertainty in model parameters.\nBecause the model accounts for process noise, uncertainty expands with the forecast\nhorizon. Finally, we recall once again that, because the process noise terms can to\nsome degree compensate for model misspecification, it was possible to diagnose the\nlatter, thus obtaining some additional qualitative appreciation of the uncertainty\nowing to this factor.

The relentless\ntrade-off between timeliness and reliability has with technological advance shifted\nsteadily in favour of more complex and realistic models. Because stochastic models\nwith greater realism, flexibility and transparency can be routinely and\nstraightforwardly fit to outbreak data, there is less and less scope for older, less\nreliable and more opaque methods. In particular, the practices of fitting\ndeterministic models and fitting models to cumulative case report data are\nprejudicial to accuracy and can no longer be justified on pragmatic grounds. We\npropose the following principles to guide modelling responses to current and future\ninfectious disease outbreaks: (1) models should be fit to raw, disaggregated data whenever\npossible and never to temporally accumulated data;(2) when model assumptions, such as independence of errors, must\nbe violated, careful checks for the effects of such violations should be\nperformed;(3) forecasts based on deterministic models, being by nature\nincapable of accurately communicating uncertainty, should be avoided;\nand(4) stochastic models should be preferred to deterministic models\nin most circumstances because they afford improved accounting for real\nvariability and increased opportunity for quantifying uncertainty.\nPost hoc comparison of simulated and actual data is\na powerful and general procedure that can be used to distinguish model\nmisspecification from real stochasticity. In closing, we are troubled that screening for lack of model fit is not a\ncompletely standard part of modelling protocol. At best, this represents a missed\nopportunity, as discrepancies between the data and off-the-shelf models may suggest\neffective control measures. At worst, this can lead to severely biased estimates\nand, worryingly, overly confident conclusions. Fortunately, effective techniques\nexist by which such errors can be diagnosed and avoided, even in circumstances\ndemanding great expedition.",
