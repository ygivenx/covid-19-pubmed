Approximately one half of all cancer patients require radiotherapy treatment during the course of their illness 1.

However, occasions arise on which radiotherapy must be planned and delivered on an emergency basis, and these occasions may occur outside of regular working hours. On weekends and statutory holidays, emergency treatments are subject to the discretion of the attending radiation oncologist.",

Using the Oncology Patient Information System scheduling module at the occ, we retrospectively identified patients who were treated with radiotherapy on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday between September 1, 2002, and September 31, 2004. These dates were chosen based on the retrospective availability of patient tracking into the radiotherapy system. Once the patients were identified, their identification numbers were used to obtain relevant information from the associated electronic patient records. Variables subsequently collected included patient age, sex, primary cancer site, specific radiation treatment field, rationale for treatment, referring hospital, attending radiation oncologist, total treatment dose, dose fractionation, occ inpatient or outpatient status, and duration of treatment. Results were then analyzed using descriptive statistics and, to assess adherence to quality assurance standards, were compared with the current departmental policy as described earlier for treatment of patients on weekends. All patient information was rendered anonymous, and research ethics approval was obtained.",

Accelerated, continuous fractionation with 7-day-per-week courses has been studied and shown to provide excellent tumour control, particularly in head-and-neck cases 10. However, in the management of palliative patients, considerably fewer data are available on the suitability of weekend treatments and acceptable standards of care. A recent study into patterns of care demonstrated that the top three reasons for administering radiation urgently were myelocompression from spinal metastases, svco, and intracranial pressure from brain metastases 5. These appear also to be the most common emergency conditions across other series 7, and the data from the present study show similar correlation. It is well recognized that spinal cord compression and svco remain classified as \u201cemergency\u201d conditions, as does tumour obstruction or bleeding 11,12. These conditions are all documented within the cco guidelines\u2014a situation that generally suggests that the intent for treatment in the present study complies with cco policy 1.",

With that statement in the policy, some radiation oncologists could justify treating an impending cord compression over the weekend if they feel it may compromise outcome; other oncologists may not feel the same way. The retrospective nature of the study made it difficult to determine from case records the exact intent for treatment in these more \u201cgrey\u201d areas, and thus, became a limitation of the research.

The notion of an \u201cemergency condition\u201d will definitely vary from one radiation oncologist to another. Aside from the top three, some of the indications for treatment are difficult to justify even with the small, but meaningful, percentage of patients who are prescribed treatment over a weekend when such prescription was unnecessary. Discrepancies will invariably arise between doctors in decision-making about emergency treatments\u2014such as those relating to an impending spinal cord compression or to painful metastases with no neurologic or organ compromise, or even to new brain metastases in patients who are relatively asymptomatic and are controlled with medical management such as corticosteroids. Additionally, as seen in Figure 1, close to 20% of patients received treatment for more than 1 site over a weekend. Perhaps the need to expedite treatment for one urgent site allowed a second site that may not have been as great an emergency to be treated simultaneously\u2014a situation that occurred in some of the cases in the present study. Along the same lines, it was unclear whether some treatments were delivered to inpatients over the weekend so as to expedite their discharge from hospital, as covered in the original occ policy. This information was very difficult to obtain, and again, the decision would be quite subjective and not necessarily documented.",

Anecdotally, its was expected that, because the occ was identified at level 0, physicians would prescribe weekend radiotherapy with little hesitation, given that most patients (who were outpatients) could receive radiotherapy treatment without risk of exposure to sars. In fact, it might have been expected that the referral rate would decline, because the occ could not accept any patients transported from a facility with a status greater than level 1. The data did not reflect a decline; a similar pattern of care was documented over the entire 2-year study period (Table I).",

Including the degree of symptom severity as measured by standardized questionnaires agreeable to the oncologists would also be useful. Collaborating with other radiation oncology centres in Ontario and Canada to document their patterns of care in the treatment of oncologic emergencies would certainly be ideal. Such collaboration would allow for improvement on the small number of cases currently analyzed and would initiate a more formal process, developing into practice guidelines in the future, to improve the standard of care for all patients who require emergency radiotherapy for their symptomatic illness.",
