            "text": "The human ntereronnducibleransembrane (IFITM) genes were originally identified by their differential response to stimulation by interferon [1,2], mediated by interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs). The family consists of five genes (IFITM1 (= Leu-13 or 927), IFITM2 (1-8D)IFITM3 (1-8U)IFITM5 and IFITM10) all on chromosome 11 (Figure 1). All five genes encode proteins with 125\u2013133 amino acids and two transmembrane domains and IFITM1, -2 and \u22123 have ISREs just 5' to their start codons [3]. Numerous biological roles have been attributed to IFITM1, -2 and \u22123 but little is known of the roles of IFITM5 and IFITM10 in humans. IFITM1 is expressed by leukocytes and endothelial cells, has anti-proliferative effects and promotes homotypic cell adhesion [4-6]. IFITM3 also inhibits cell proliferation [7], while IFITM2 induces both cell cycle arrest and subsequent p53-independent apoptosis in numerous cell lines [8]. IFITM proteins are also important components of the interferon-mediated innate immune system, and interest in these proteins has increased recently with the discovery that IFITM1, -2 and \u22123 offer protection against numerous viruses, including Influenza A, Dengue and HIV [9-11]. They may also act as tumor suppressors because of their ability to control the cell cycle. Supporting this idea, cells transitioning from a normal to a pre-malignant state often exhibit abnormal IFITM expression [12].",

Ifitm3 is on mouse chromosome 7, together with Ifitm1 (Mil2, Fragilis 2), Ifitm2 (Mil3, Fragilis 3), Ifitm5 (Fragilis 4), Ifitm6 (Fragilis 5) [15] and Ifitm10 (also known as 6330512M04Rik), whereas Ifitm7 (Mil4) is on mouse chromosome 16 [14]. Murine Ifitm genes encode proteins with 104\u2013144 amino acids and two transmembrane domains. Ifitm1-3 and \u22126 also have ISREs [14,15]. Mouse Ifitm1-2 and \u22123 genes are not respectively orthologous to human IFITM1-2 and \u22123 genes, and sequence comparisons between human and mouse Ifitm genes suggest that duplication of the Ifitm genes occurred independently in human and mouse lineages [15].",

During murine embryonic development, Ifitm1 is expressed in the extraembryonic and embryonic mesoderm until the mesoderm differentiates [14,15].

Ifitm1 and \u22123 may also control PGC migration. Application of ectopic Ifitm1 and \u22123 or silencing of Ifitm1 via short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown in embryos results in abnormal PGC migration [17]. Ifitm1 could also be required for somite epithelialisation and formation of paraxial mesoderm, as these processes are defective when Ifitm1 is silenced in vivo by RNA interference [18]. Knockdown of Ifitm5 in osteoblast cell lines in vitro results in reduced bone mineralisation, implicating Ifitm5 in matrix mineralisation and maturation [16]. Mice homozygous null for Ifitm5 have smaller skeletons than heterozygous or wild type mice but their relatively mild phenotype suggests that the function of Ifitm5 can be compensated for by some other factor [19]. The possibility of redundancy of Ifitm genes is supported by another study in which the locus containing the Ifitm cluster (Ifitm1-2-3-5 and \u22126) was deleted by floxing out a 120-kb region. The resulting mice, even those homozygous for the deletion, apparently developed normally and were fully fertile, suggesting that these Ifitm genes are not essential for normal germline development or any other developmental process [20] and that their roles can be compensated for by other genes.",

Interest in IFITMs in humans has increased with the discovery of their roles as anti-viral agents and as markers of cancer and inflammatory diseases [12]. Such roles have not been described in the mouse, in which the main focus on Ifitms has been with respect to their role(s) in the development of the germ cell lineage. The lack of sequence conservation of IFITMs between human and mouse suggests that their roles may vary between species. Marsupials diverged from eutherians approximately 160 million years ago [23] and the Australian and South American marsupials have evolved independently since the break-up of Gondwana approximately 80 million years ago [24]. Comparing marsupial and eutherian IFITM genes will provide new information on the conservation and evolution of this gene family in mammals. This study therefore describes IFITM genes in two marsupial species, the Australian tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii (a macropodid marsupial) and the South American short-tailed grey opossum Monodelphis domestica (a didelphid marsupial) and compares them with existing genomic databases.",

Therefore each tammar IFITM gene was used to search the tammar transcriptome and EST (expressed sequence tag) databases [25]. No transcripts representing IFITM5 or IFITM10 were identified. Two sequences containing at least the second exon and the polyA signal of IFITMA2 and one for IFITMB were obtained and all supported the 3\u2032 UTR identified by the BAC sequencing. There were four matches for IFITMA1, with two supporting a short 3\u2032 UTR and the other two suggesting longer 3\u2032 UTRs, only one of which contained a polyA signal. Thus, IFITMA1 appears to have several transcripts.

Only one small IFITM protein of approximately 30 amino acids was found for the lamprey (agnathan) and this aligns to IFITM1 and \u22123-like IFITM genes from the turkey, zebrafish and frog with a higher score than it does to any IFITM5 or \u221210 orthologue (data not shown).

It also appears that like in mouse and human, there may be multiple transcripts for some of the tammar IFITM genes. Two tammar IFITM genes have a potential ISRE, similar to eutherian IFITMs. The apparent lack of any ISREs in opossum IFITMs is probably an artifact of lack of sufficient 5\u2032 sequence for IFITMA, rather than an actual absence of this motif. ISREs may not be essential for IFITM expression; murine Ifitm3 has two ISREs [15] but mutation of both motifs does not affect the expression of Ifitm3 in the gastrula stage mouse embryo or in fetal gonads [17]. In the tammar several IFITMs are expressed during gastrulation, raising the possibility of a role for IFITM genes in marsupial germ cell development, although localisation of the transcripts is required before any conclusions can be drawn.",

The orthologous relationships among other IFITM genes are often not very clear. A previous phylogenetic analysis of IFITM genes concluded that there is a high probability of primate-specific gene duplications [12], although concerted evolution cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the higher sequence similarity between paralogues rather than orthologues for many of the IFITMs. The low conservation among IFITM genes, even between species from the same subclass, suggests that either the roles of the different IFITM genes are not conserved between species or, more likely, that there is redundancy between them. The latter idea is strongly supported by an experiment in which the entire IFITM locus was deleted in mice without any apparent effects on normal development [20]. In fact, the study by [20] also suggests that at least during embryonic development, the IFITM family itself may be redundant. Further work is needed to clarify how critical IFITMs are for both embryonic development and general survival. The rapid evolution of IFITMs could be linked to their capacity to act as anti-viral agents; frequent mutation and duplications of these genes may act to counteract virus adaptations [12].",

Expression data for human and mouse IFITM genes is available from the Unigene expressed sequence tag collection database [27] and some RT-PCR data is also available for the mouse [20]. Even the expression pattern of the most highly conserved IFITM, the tetrapod-specific IFITM10, differs between the three species although expression is more similar between human and tammar than either of these species are to mouse. In mouse Ifitm10 is expressed in the brain and spleen, yet it is absent from these tissues in both the tammar (Figure 4) and human. Conversely, IFITM10 is expressed in bone in tammar and human but not in mouse. The exceptionally high sequence conservation suggests that this gene has an important and conserved function, making it hard to reconcile the apparent lack of conservation in expression patterns. It is also curious that there is almost no information available on this gene in any species: the exception is a brief mention that Ifitm10 ESTs are over-represented in the mouse brain [28].",

Paralogues of IFITM5 were identified by using Ensembl [31]. Primers based on human or opossum IFITMs were used to amplify tammar IFITMs by RT-PCR. The resulting products were cloned and sequenced and these sequences were then used to search the M. eugenii whole genomic shotgun (WGS) trace archives using BLASTn and tBLASTn [32] with discontiguous megablasts. This usually yielded small contigs containing either the first or second exon of each gene. These contigs were assembled using the online CAP3 program [33]. Sequence from these was then used to design tammar-specific primers within the 5 and 3 prime UTRs of each gene (Table 3). The ORF of each tammar IFITM gene was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned and sequenced.",

Bony fish are the first class in which IFITM5 (blue line) is present, whereas IFITM10 (red line) is tetrapod-specific. Note that in the cartilaginous fishes and urodeles (for which only EST data is available), IFITM orthologues listed as not present (dotted lines) may in fact exist but have not been detected due to the lack of a comprehensive genomic database. Extensive searching of the platypus (a monotreme) genome yielded a full transcript for IFITM5, but only partial transcripts for IFITM and IFITM10. *this information is based only on EST data because a genomic database is not available.",
