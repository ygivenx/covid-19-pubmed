It is bitter in flavor and cold in nature, categorized in kidney, urinary bladder, and large intestine meridians. The traditional functions are to clear heat, dry dampness, purge fire, and remove toxicity. It is one of fundamental traditional Chinese medicines. Previous study reported that C. phellodendri has many physiological activities, including antioxidant [2, 3], anti-inflammatory [4\u20136], antiulcer [7], and immune-stimulating properties [8], as well as neuroprotection and inhibition of coronavirus replication [9, 10]. Moreover, C. phellodendri combining with other herbs can reduce complications of corticosteroid-resistant asthma [11]. Berberine is one active ingredient of C. phellodendri; berberine from Argemone ochroleuca was demonstrated to have a relaxant effect in guinea-pig ASM [12]. However, whether the nonberberine component has similar relaxant action has not been investigated.",

Following the increase in the K+ concentration from 10 to 80 mM, the TRs exhibited dose-dependent contraction (Figure 1(a)). Upon the contraction reaching the maximum (at 80 mM K+), NBAECP was added. The contraction was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. An identical experiment was also performed in a TR from an asthmatic model mouse, and similar results were observed (Figure 1(b)). NBAECP-induced relaxation in both control and asthmatic TRs was analyzed, and the values of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) were calculated (Figure 1(c)). There were no significant differences between the two traces and the values of IC50. These results indicated that NBAECP could inhibit agonist-induced sustained contraction of control and asthmatic ASM.",

To investigate whether NBAECP has relaxant action, we used high K+ and ACH to contract airway smooth muscle and then observed the effect of NBAECP. NBAECP totally relaxed high K+-induced precontractions (Figure 1). High K+ could induce membrane depolarization, resulting in the activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) [16]. The channels then mediated Ca2+ influx, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases, leading to muscle contraction. Nifedipine, a selective blocker of VDCCs, completely blocked high K+-induced contractions. This phenomenon was observed in our previous study [14, 17]. These results indicated that high K+-induced contractions completely depended on L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ influx. Thus, NBAECP-induced complete inhibition of high K+-induced contraction due to NBAECP resulted in the inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels, thus terminating Ca2+ influx. However, the inhibitory mechanism of NBAECP on L-type Ca2+ channels must be further investigated.",

Among them, G protein-coupled M3 plays a more important role in the contraction of airway smooth muscle [19]. Stimulation of M3 by agonists results in intracellular Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the PLC-IP3-IP3R pathway [20]. This leads to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increasing and further triggering airway smooth muscle contraction. However, this pathway only mediates transient contractions [21], while the sustained contraction depends on Ca2+ influx from the extracellular side and/or Ca2+ sensitization [22, 23]. Hence, the M3 agonist ACH-induced sustained contraction in airway smooth muscle (Figure 2) was probably due to Ca2+ influx. Previous reports have demonstrated that L-type Ca2+ channels play roles in ACH-induced airway smooth muscle contraction [24]. These findings were further confirmed in this study, in which nifedipine partially inhibited ACH-induced contraction in TRs (Figure 3).",
