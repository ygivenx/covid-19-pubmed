Sialyltransferase adds SA to the terminal sugar residues, such as galactose (Gal), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) [1]. The conjugation between Gal and SA can be either in the form of an \u03b12,3 or an \u03b12,6 glycosidic linkage. In mammals, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the two most common types of SA, but Neu5Ac is the major type of SA in birds [2].",

Two types of M. amurensis lectins were discovered: one that can agglutinate erythrocytes (hemagglutinin) (MAH, also known as MAL-II) and one that can agglutinate leukocytes (MAL, also known as MAM, MAA, MAL-I). Although both MAL-I and MAL-II recognize the SA\u03b12\u20133Gal glycan, previous studies [4] and recent glycan microarray data [5] demonstrated that subterminal sugars affect their binding affinity to these two lectins. For example, MAL-I, rather than MAL-II, showed the highest affinity to the SA\u03b12\u20133Gal\u03b21\u20134GalNAc and did not bind to this oligosaccharide when the subterminal \u03b21,4-linkage was replaced by a \u03b21,3-linkage [6].",

            "text": "Cell entry by influenza virus depends on the recognition of a terminal SA-capped glycosylated molecules by the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein [3]. Generally, human influenza viruses preferentially bind to cell surface oligosaccharides that have the SA\u03b12\u20136Gal linkage, while avian influenza viruses (AIVs) prefer SA\u03b12\u20133Gal [3]. Especially, the glycans containing the SA\u03b12\u20133Gal\u03b21\u20134GalNAc or SA\u03b12\u20133Gal\u03b21\u20134(6OSO3)GalNAc, show a high affinity to MAA/MAL-I [4] and AIVs [7], [8]. Tracheal/bronchial epithelium, mainly consisting of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells, is the initially attacked tissue by the invading influenza viruses. The infected chicken trachea shows necrosis and detachment of ciliated cells, suggesting that ciliated cell is one of the cells targeted by AIV [9]. Previous analyses of the expression of SAs in chicken have revealed that \u03b12,3-linked SA was localized on tracheal ciliated cells and \u03b12,6-linked SAs was also present in the tracheal tissues [10], [11], [12]. However, the detailed distribution of SAs among chicken tracheal epithelial (CTE) cells remains unclear. Clarification of the distribution and the expression intensity of influenza receptor on CTE cells will help us to understand the viral tropism, viral spreading and the pathogenesis of avian influenza viruses. Here, the SA distribution on CTE cells were identified by the staining of biotin-labeled plant lectins. A Taiwan-isolated AIV H6N1 was applied to characterize the cell tropism of AIV and the correlation of the cell tropism of AIV to the SA distribution on CTE cells was also explored.",

Our previous study indicated that the replication of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is restricted to ciliated cells and goblet cells, but not basal cells [21]. The tracheal/bronchial basal cells, assumed as multipotent stem cells, are responsible for epithelial recovery and reestablish normal respiratory function after desquamation of the ciliated and goblet cells [14], [15]. In an uncomplicated IBV-infected chick, clinical signs persist for only 1 week and the unaffected basal cells may be responsible for epithelial reconstruction of the injured respiratory tract [22]. In contrast, basal cells are susceptible to the infection of avian influenza virus at a MOI of 1. The susceptibility of basal cells to AIV infection suggests that infection with AIV alone may cause the cell death of basal cells, and consequently affect basal membrane integrity and severe inflammation in the AIV infected trachea.",

In addition, both SNA and SNA-I failed to label the \u03b2-tubulin+ cells, indicating that SA\u03b12\u20136Gal is exclusively expressed on non-ciliated cells. In humans, by contrast, both ciliated and goblet cells can be labeled with MAA/MAL-I and SNA [19], [20], indicating that these two epithelial cells have both types of influenza viral receptors. Moreover, both ciliated and goblet cells cells are permissive to infection by human influenza viruses [19], [20]. Interestingly, using duck influenza A viruses to infect human airway epithelial cells, the viral antigen could only be detected in the ciliated cells, but not in the goblet cells, possibly due to the low SA\u03b12\u20133Gal expression on the surface of goblet cells and a low MOI infection [19], [20].",

Especially, this secreted mucin was shown to prevent infection by influenza viruses with a SA\u03b12\u20133Gal preference in the airway [26]. This false-receptor effect may mask the HA of the AIV, disable the viral access to the goblet cells and also account, at least in part, for the hindrance of AIV infection to human goblet cell [26]. In chicken trachea, goblet cells exhibit high affinity for SNA, suggesting that the mucin may contain SA\u03b12\u20136Gal glycans. The viral neutralization effect of mucin in humans may be recapitulated in chickens to aid the clearance of the invading influenza viruses with a SA\u03b12\u20136Gal preference.",

Notably, although AIVs can bind to the terminal SA\u03b12\u20133Gal, duck and chicken influenza viruses exhibit different affinities for glycans with different subterminal residues [7], [8]. For example, duck influenza viruses prefer Gal\u03b21\u20133GlcNAc or Gal\u03b21\u20133GalNAc, but chicken influenza viruses prefer Gal\u03b21\u20134GlcNAc or Gal\u03b21\u20134(6OSO3)GlcNAc [7], [8]. Our study suggests that SA\u03b12,3-capped oligosaccharides following a Gal\u03b21,3-linkage [6] are candidate sugars conjugated to the chicken tracheal mucin protein. Determining the SA composites of chicken mucin protein and the neutralizing effect of chicken mucin on duck influenza viruses will be an interesting task that will provide important information about the innate defense mechanisms in the chicken trachea and about the interspecies transmission of influenza viruses between ducks and chickens.",

In addition, at a low MOI, most H6N1 proteins were detected in the SA\u03b12\u20133Gal-rich ciliated cells, and few in the goblet and basal cells. These results indicate that the chicken H6N1 virus, even with a Ser228 (using H3 HA numbering) in its HA, still possesses a SA\u03b12\u20133Gal preference. Similarly, the HA 226 residue, critical to cell tropism in human H3 and H9N2, has been shown to be an insufficient binding site for determining the receptor tropism of the human H1, H2, H5 and the avian H6, H9 and H5N1 viruses [4], [33], [34], [35]. These results emphasize that receptor tropism is determined by several critical residues in the HA proteins, but these sites in HA are not highly conserved among different influenza viruses.",

The procedure for removing epithelial sheets from the tracheas and the detailed culture conditions for the CTE cells have been described previously [21]. Briefly, tracheas were digested with dispase I solution (2.5 U/ml dispase I, Roche) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. The detached cell sheets of tracheal epithelium from the tracheal lumen were harvested and further digested with collagenase I (1 mg/ml, Roche) for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. The disrupted tracheal epithelial sheets were gently pippeted and homogenized into small cell clumps. The cell pellets were resuspended in a CTE medium [21] and were seeded on 2% matrigel-coated 24-well plates (Corning). The cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 3 days. The animal use protocol in this study had been reviewed and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in National Chung Hsing University. The approval number is 99-09.",

The specificity of the anti-AIV 2838 polyclonal antibodies (1\u2236500, from infected chickens) has been evaluated in our previous report [37]. Appropriate fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies (2\u00b0 Ab, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Rockland) were used for visualization. Blue 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for nuclear staining. The number of ICC-staining positive cells in a 24-well plate was manually counted from five individual fields. Images of the immunostaining were captured using a confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta, Zeiss). For comparing the expression intensity of SA among CTE cells, the images were collected with the same setting and same objective (40\u00d7) under the confocal microscope.",
