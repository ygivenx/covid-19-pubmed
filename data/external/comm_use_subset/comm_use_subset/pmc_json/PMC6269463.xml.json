This risk has been recently reinforced by human epidemics in Singapore of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)1, 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus2, and enterovirus 713,4 (which causes hand, foot and mouth disease). Other major threats to Singapore include Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV)5,6 and various avian7 (H7N4, H7N9, H5N2, H5N1, etc.) and swine8 (H3N2, H1N1, H1N2) influenza A viruses, especially if they become highly transmissible between humans. For instance, the first human case of A(H7N4) was confirmed in February 20189, and a total of 1,625 human cases of A(H7N9) have been reported since 201310, with 47% (766) in the 5th wave of the epidemic from October 2016 to September 201711. Compared to the estimated 0.02% case fatality rate for the global 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus12, A(H7N9) (including both high and low pathogenic strains) has an alarming 38% case fatality rate, which has resulted in 623 known deaths since its emergence in 201310,13,14.",

For example, during the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, countries receiving the highest volume of passengers (>1,400 in two months) from Mexico (the country of origin of the 2009 H1N1 virus), had a significantly higher risk of virus importation associated with travel to Mexico15. China (the country of origin of A(H7N4) and A(H7N9) viruses) is the third largest market of travelers for Singapore Changi Airport, which receives ~60,000 passengers from China per week. With Singapore\u2019s close connection to China, and recent evidence suggesting the potential for airborne transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N9)16, it is prudent for Singapore to ramp up disease surveillance. The ability to quickly identify and robustly track respiratory threats is fundamentally important for an early emergency response.",

An international project named MetaSUB18 was launched to map the microbiome of transit networks in the world\u2019s largest cities. Over 50 cities, including Singapore, Boston, Shanghai, Paris, Stockholm, and S\u00e3o Paolo are participating in the project to improve city planning and public health. Although baseline metagenomic maps created from these studies are said to be useful for mitigating bioterrorism and infectious disease outbreaks, most of them focus largely on mapping surface-borne bacterial DNA17 and neglect to address the threat of weaponized or global catastrophic biological risk-level (GCBR-level) agents, both of which would likely be aerosolized or respiratory-borne RNA viruses19.",

Mathematical models have been developed to assess the risk of airborne and droplet transmission of respiratory viruses in buses, airline cabins and cities26\u201328, and although these simulation data are useful, we have sparse field data to support them. In this study, we sought to monitor for respiratory viruses in Singapore\u2019s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network, a likely area of virus incursion as well as a pathway for virus transmission. Specifically, we asked, could noninvasive bioaerosol sampling detect respiratory viruses in Singapore\u2019s MRT network?",

Cultures in this study were negative and therefore the viruses detected may have been non-viable. However, studies have demonstrated that upon the first ~15 minutes of aerosolization, viruses tend to decay the most rapidly29,30, and therefore it is possible that the viability of the viruses captured in our study rapidly decreased during sample collection and transport. Moreover, temperature and RH have been widely understood to influence the viability of aerosolized viruses31. However, novel research has recently demonstrated that the viability of aerosolized influenza virus is independent of RH when the aerosol composition includes human bronchial epithelial (HBE) extracellular material (ECM)32, indicating that the influence of RH is more so on the rate of aerosol deposition after expulsion, which in turn, influences the overall concentration of viral aerosols in the environment. Aerosols tend to deposit onto surfaces more quickly at higher RH levels (>50%), suggesting that greater time spent in controlled environments with lower, more comfortable RH levels, could increase the risk of acquiring a respiratory virus via inhalation and respiration. Therefore, the average RH level (63%) on the Singapore MRT is not theoretically conducive to heavy airborne transmission of influenza viruses.",

            "text": "A likely contributor to the lack of data regarding airborne transmission of viruses is the difficulty of detecting respiratory pathogens in the air. Standard detection methods are designed to target viral nucleic acids which are subject to degradation from various environmental stressors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and UV light) as well as physical stress from aerosol sample collection methods, potentially deterring downstream detection. Therefore, high RH levels, in addition to sample degradation, could explain the low recovery of virus-positive aerosol samples in our study. Additionally, viral bioaerosols have notoriously low airborne concentrations, reducing the sensitivity of bioaerosol sampling. Some bioaerosol samplers, such as the NIOSH sampler used in this study, are compact and require a low flow rate which also may reduce sensitivity. Although the air pump flow rate and sample collection times used in our study have been demonstrated to efficiently capture aerosolized influenza virus and RSV RNA33\u201335, it is possible that these parameters are not optimal for capturing the other respiratory virus DNA/RNA targeted in our study. For example, it is possible that when compared to RNA viruses (e.g., influenza virus, RSV), adenovirus (a more durable DNA virus) can withstand a higher flow rate and/or longer sampling duration. Furthermore, although each of the assays used to detect viral DNA/RNA in our aerosol samples are highly sensitive, validated, singleplex real-time RT-PCR/PCR assays, specific detection limits (viral copies per volume of air) were not tested in our laboratory. Therefore, our DNA/RNA detections should not be mistaken as a true representation of the prevalence/densities of these viruses circulating in the air of the MRT, but rather a representation of the viruses our bioaerosol sampling technique is capable of detecting in this environment. To improve the sensitivity and specificity of bioaerosol sampling, more virus-specific controlled studies are needed to determine optimal sampling parameters for multiple respiratory viruses.",

Furthermore, unlike temperate climates with distinct seasons, Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with high temperatures and humidity levels year-round, with little monthly variation. Therefore, Singapore experiences influenza outbreaks year-round, with two peak periods (April\u2013June and September\u2013December). Although we were able to stratify our pilot study data by month, our results are too limited to properly assess a correlation between virus-positive aerosols and Singapore\u2019s peak influenza periods. However, it is notable that the influenza A virus-positive and suspect-positive aerosol samples were both detected during Singapore\u2019s second peak influenza period in 2017. Additionally, RSV-A-positive aerosols were collected during weeks of increased polyclinic attendances for acute respiratory infections in Singapore36. Adenovirus-positive aerosols were collected during weeks of increased, average and decreased polyclinic attendances for acute respiratory infections36. A larger study yielding more aerosol samples over a longer duration would be needed to further characterize the relationship between bioaerosols in the MRT and community health data in Singapore.",
