The relationship between incubation period and disease severity may have a number of underlying reasons. A greater infecting dose may be associated with a shorter incubation period and increased severity. Alternatively, underlying diseases that predispose to adverse clinical outcome may also impact the incubation period and the subsequent disease severity. Since the pathogenesis of some of these diseases are related to aberrant inflammatory response, the incubation period and severity may both reflect differences in pathogenesis [7]. It has been suggested that there are differences in the underlying pathogenesis following H7N9 virus infection compared to influenza A(H5N1) virus and SARS or MERS coronavirus infections [8\u201310]. In this study we examined the association between the severity of human infections with H7N9 virus and the length of the incubation period.",

Exposure data were available for 203/395 (51%) of cases. In the majority of those cases, the information on exposure was recorded as intervals of 2 or more days during which infection was thought to have occurred rather than exact dates of presumed infection [2]. For the subset of cases without available exposure data, we assumed their incubation time fell in the interval (0,14) days [2].",

However, this approach is somewhat na\u00efve, and is likely to overestimate incubation period distributions which tend to be right-skewed [2]. Therefore to estimate the incubation period distribution, we fitted a Weibull distribution allowing for interval censoring [2], estimating the shape and scale parameters using Markov Chain Monte Carlo in a Bayesian framework [5]. We assumed that the incubation period distribution had different parameters among the non-fatal cases and the fatal cases and we consequently estimated two different couple of parameters (k, \u03b8) of the Weibull distribution using MCMC. To evaluate the potential factors such as age, sex, location and underlying conditions that could be associated with the length of the incubation period, we fitted to the data a multiple linear regression model using also MCMC in a Bayesian framework with the incubation period as response variable and age, sex, location and underlying conditions as explanatory variables.",

These apparently conflicting results could be a consequence of the differences in the pathogenesis of H7N9 compared to the SARS and MERS coronaviruses. SARS coronavirus evade host interferon responses but cause dysregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, as also occurs in H5N1 virus infections [8,12]. Moreover, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV present both clinical similarities and efficiently inhibit the activation of the type I IFN response which has not been shown in the case of H7N9 [13\u201315], although other aspects of MERS-CoV pathogenesis seems to be slightly different from SARS-CoV regarding growth characteristics, receptor usage and host response but leading finally to more severe cytopathic effects [16\u201318]. Recent studies showed that H7N9 induces a lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, compared with the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d induced by H5N1 virus and SARS coronavirus [9]. H7N9 viruses also differ from H5N1 virus, SARS and MERS coronaviruses in their tropism for the human upper airways [18,19]. Thus H5N1 virus, SARS and MERS coronaviruses very likely have to directly access the lower respiratory tract and alveolar epithelium to initiate infection whereas H7N9 virus can infect the upper airways. Moreover, mortality for H7N9 cases is correlated with a wider distribution of viral antigens in the lungs [9]. Finally, human disease associated with H7N9 virus infection differs from H5N1, SARS and MERS coronaviruses in that severe H7N9 disease is associated with exacerbation of other underlying diseases, while H5N1, SARS and MERS coronaviruses cause disease in otherwise healthy persons. Collectively, these differences may explain why the fatal H7N9 cases had a longer incubation period, as the virus could spread deeper in the organism due to an abnormal immune response and potentially induced severe adverse events, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, increasing the risk of death [9].",
