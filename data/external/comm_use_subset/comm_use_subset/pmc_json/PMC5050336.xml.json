            "text": "Microbial genome sequencing efforts continue at an increasing rate, resulting in an expanding catalogue of genes of unknown function for important pathogens (Fig. 1). In some cases, up to 40% of the annotated genes in fully sequenced microbial genomes have no known or predicted function. In many cases, these uncharacterized genes are highly conserved and are implicated in the pathogenic process through either their timing of expression or requirement for microbial replication. Such data indicate that these genes execute important, general biological functions. The interpretation of existing and emerging microbial genomics data will require the scientific community to uncover new paradigms hidden within these sequences. This point is highlighted by a recent publication by Hutchison et al. focused on building a minimal genome of Mycoplasma mycoides (1). The 473 genes in this genome include many required for known essential functions, such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, but the genome also contains 149 genes (~31%) of unknown function. Likewise, the known coding capacity of DNA viruses has been doubled over the past few years, an achievement made possible by using novel high-throughput sequencing and proteomic methods. The discovery of these genes of unknown function not only promises to affect our understanding of microbial pathogenesis but also provides an undiscovered wealth of new therapeutic targets for antibiotic, antiviral, and vaccine development for improved global and economic health.",

Simple deletion or overexpression of an uncharacterized gene often fails to yield any discernible phenotype in standard laboratory contexts. In the same vein, a purely biochemical approach that relies on purification and in vitro biochemical characterization of uncharacterized genes often fails to yield fruitful functional data. Furthermore, while sequence-based bioinformatic analyses and computational models may provide clues about functional genetic interactions, such predictions are often limited by our current biological knowledge and databases. As a consequence, functional annotation is incorrect in many cases because unvalidated information is propagated across species. In cases where gene function is experimentally assigned and validated, the information is often not broadly propagated or may not apply to another organism. Therefore, a successful functional annotation endeavor requires a multipronged approach that involves open collaboration among scientists with expertise in genetics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, biochemistry, cell physiology, host-microbe interactions, and data management. Such a program is outside the scope of traditional funding mechanisms and requires integrated teams of experts and new high-throughput experimental methodologies.",

The NIAID Functional Genomics (FG) program builds on previous functional annotation efforts, such as COMBREX (2), and brings together multidisciplinary groups to work on shared goals. Its mission is to probe new biology in pathogenic bacteria and viruses by assigning functions to new genes. The FG program is unique in its approach in that it enables principal investigators to follow up on \u201comics\u201d and phenotypic screening data with targeted experiments to establish gene function.

The challenge to the experimentalist is to develop systematic approaches to gene function discovery that have a reasonable chance of success over a large number of genes. FG Centers are taking a variety of approaches to uncover the functions of protein-coding genes and small ncRNAs. Some approaches, which perhaps will have the highest yield, require at least some prediction of function, while others presuppose no specific functional knowledge. Current state-of-the-art technologies, such as genome synthesis, next-generation nucleic acid sequencing, ribosomal profiling, high-resolution mass spectrometry, metabolomics, and molecular and systems modeling, enable high-throughput approaches to characterize genes of unknown function. Though these technologies are clearly valuable, they are most effectively leveraged when combined with functional assays, such as measurements of microbial permeability and antimicrobial susceptibility or assays of host response to infection, which have been scaled up through recent developments in robotics, whole-genome synthesis, and high-content cellular imaging. In this commentary, we provide an overview of our coordinated efforts that are aimed at filling the gaps in our understanding of microbial gene function. These efforts are restricted to a few organisms and technologies but could be attempted on a much larger scale. Such functional analyses could provide the scientific basis for rational approaches to the development of new therapeutic products to combat future and current gaps in the treatment of bacterial and viral infection.",

Moreover, predictive algorithms to define the locations of non-protein-coding genes (e.g., small ncRNAs, out-of-frame ORFs, etc.) are generally poor. Defining the boundaries of genes of unknown function is an important component of experimental functional annotation. We are using combinations of directed biochemical, computational, and next-generation-sequencing approaches to produce improved maps of gene boundaries in bacterial and viral pathogens.

We are employing such biochemical association strategies. For protein-coding genes, we are measuring protein-protein associations using quantitative proteomic methods. For example, using a proteomics approach, we reported that Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1) can bind the cellular interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) E3 ligase, HERC5. Interaction of vIRF1 with HERC5 inhibits the conjugation of ISG15 to cellular proteins, thereby dampening the IFN response to the virus (6). Using a functional genomics screen, coupled with synthetic genome design, we demonstrated that the S glycoprotein genes of several severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-like bat coronaviruses can bind human receptors for entry and replicate efficiently in primary human airway epithelial cells and that they are resistant to existing SARS vaccines and immunotherapeutics (7, 8). Our early results suggest that an efficient way to discover function using this approach is to target protein complexes of known function and define associated proteins of unknown function. These efforts have required us to develop new bioinformatics methods to understand the complex data produced by these experiments.",

Shared solutions drive research forward. For example, each center includes a small RNA (sRNA) discovery project. There is no generally agreed upon approach to elucidating sRNA gene function. It has been useful to compare experiences and potential solutions across centers. sRNA discovery projects as a group are converging on approaches that may work generally in bacteria. In addition, the data management groups at the four centers share common priorities for public dissemination of data and were able as a group to begin the process of defining new priorities for updating capabilities for the PATRIC and VIPR BRC public resources. An example of this collaboration is the specification of the mode and format for transfer of transposon-sequencing (Tn-Seq) experimental data and Biolog phenotyping data to PATRIC, along with the computational tools to analyze these data (16). This effort will standardize the process of data transfer from independent centers and will define the format for public display of these and other data sets generated by FG Centers.",

The work of this program is defining a future blueprint to perform functional analysis of new pathogens as they emerge and to more rapidly respond to the need for knowledge of emerging organisms.",
