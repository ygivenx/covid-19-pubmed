            "text": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, and is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen which causes Rift Valley fever (RVF). RVF is characterized by an acute febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorder or blindness in humans [1], [2], [3], [4]. In ruminants, RVFV induces a high rate of abortion or fetal malformation as well as lethal hepatitis in newborn lambs [5]. The first recognized outbreak of RVF occurred in Kenya in 1930 [6], and RVFV has spread from endemic region in sub-Saharan Africa into Egypt [7], Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. The potential threat of RVFV introduction into non-endemic countries raises concern of agriculture and public health [13], [14], [15]. RVFV is a risk group 3 pathogen, Category A pathogen and an overlap select agent by the CDC/USDA [16]. The handling of wild-type (wt) RVFV within the U.S. requires BSL3+ or BSL4 facilities. Live-attenuated MP-12 vaccine strain is excluded from select agent rule, and handled at BSL2 level. MP-12 encodes for functional NSs protein, which is useful for the analyses of various NSs functions at BSL2 level [17], [18], [19].",

NSs is a major virulence factor of RVFV and inhibits host general transcription through sequestration of TFIIH p44 [24] or promotion of TFIIH p62 subunits degradation [19]. NSs also inhibits host antiviral response by inhibiting the activation of interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 promoter through interaction with Sin3A-associated protein (SAP30) at aa.210\u2013230 [25], [26], and promotion of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) degradation [17], [27], [28].",

A number of candidate vaccines are under development including live-attenuated vaccine [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], formalin-inactivated vaccine [41], [42], subunit vaccine [43], virus-like particle [44], [45], [46], [47], nonspreading RVFV replicon [48], [49], viral vectors [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], and DNA vaccines [57], [58], [59]. For treatment of ongoing outbreaks, several antivirals have been tested for RVFV infection. Liposome-encapsulated ribavirin is effective to treat RVFV infection in mice [60], while a potent IFN inducer, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-Lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose [Poly(LCIC)] are effective in combination with ribavirin [61]. Therapeutic administration of IFN-\u03b1 into rhesus monkeys infected with RVFV also limits RVFV replication [62]. The 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide (T-705) is shown to be more effective to inhibit RVFV replication than ribavirin [63], while antiviral small molecule, LJ001 was shown to be effective to numerous enveloped viruses including RVFV [64]. These studies suggest that increased innate immune responses could inhibit RVFV replication in addition to antivirals specific to viral proteins.",

Thus, we aimed to attenuate RVFV NSs function(s) by co-expressing nonfunctional NSs. It has been shown that recombinant MP-12 virus encoding truncated NSs at aa.210 to 230 (SAP30-binding domain) does not inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis [26]. Thus, we employed a similar strategy to abolish a part of NSs functions by truncating each 17 to 25 aa. Co-expression of such truncated NSs may exhibit dominant-negative phenotype by self-association through the C-terminus at the self-association domain (aa.249 to 265) [65]. In this study, we generated NSs encoding deletions of 17 to 25 amino acids, characterized the functions of truncated NSs, and analyzed the dominant-negative effects of co-expressed truncated NSs in cells infected with RVFV.",

Northern blot was performed using RNA probe specific to human IFN-\u03b2, ISG56 or RVFV anti-viral-sense S RNA/N mRNA as described previously [66], [67]. We tested ISG56 gene, one of the genes controlled under IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), to confirm the inhibition of host transcription suppression including IFN-\u03b2 mRNA by NSs. As expected, cells infected with MP-12 inhibited the synthesis of IFN-\u03b2 and ISG56 mRNA, while those infected with rMP12-C13type induced both IFN-\u03b2 and ISG56 mRNA (\nFig. 2B\n). Interestingly, none of NSs mutants, including NS\u0394210\u2013230 lacking SAP30-binding domain, had inhibited IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis. Viral replication of those mutants was significantly decreased in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells (Fig. S2).

For RVFV, L proteins form oligomer, and exhibit dominant-negative function [74]. In this study, we used NSs protein as a target protein of dominant-negative suppression, because a lack of NSs dramatically attenuates RVFV [75], [76]. Since NSs can self-associate and form filamentous inclusion bodies in infected cells [65], [77], we hypothesized that co-expression of nonfunctional NSs with the C-terminal self-association domain in cells infected with RVFV allows incorporation of such nonfunctional NSs into the NSs filament, and attenuates a part of NSs functions. However, our results were not as expected; 1) most of truncated NSs localized at cytoplasm, 2) all of truncated NSs did not accumulate as much as parental NSs in cells, and 3) none of truncated NSs significantly interfered with MP-12 NSs functions. Our results suggest truncation of NSs causes mis-folding and/or mis-localization of protein, which might abolish the ability to interact with authentic MP-12 NSs through the C-terminus self-association domain. Unexpectedly, only the co-expression of NSs lacking C-terminus self-association domain (NS\u0394249\u2013265) slightly inhibited PKR degradation by MP-12 NSs. The NS\u0394249\u2013265 could accumulate both in cytoplasm and nucleus, which is consistent with previous study [65]. We speculate that NS\u0394249\u2013265 could compete with host factors required for PKR degradation with intact NSs. In the meantime, co-expression of NS\u0394249\u2013265 NSs did not result in a significant decrease of RVFV replication when compared to CAT RNA transfection control. Therefore, the co-expression of NSs fragments in infected cells might not be an effective strategy to inhibit RVFV replication in vivo.",

This suggests that conformation structure might be important for those NSs functions rather than the presence of linear domain. Our results suggest that those truncated NSs decrease accumulation level, and change the localization pattern in cells. The stability and cellular localization of NSs, which are probably controlled by conformational domain, might be important for biological functions of NSs. Although the C-terminus 17 amino acids were determined as a self-association domain important for filament formation [65], our result suggests that filament formation does not occur by NSs encoding an in-frame truncation with 25 amino acids. It is possible that the C-terminus 17 amino acids are the prerequisite of NSs self-association, and other structural domains play a role in the filament formation through the C-terminus domain.",

It was also shown that NSs binding to SAP30 is required for NSs filaments to target pericentromeric DNA and induce nuclear anomalies [78]. They described that rec-ZH\u0394210-230 expresses a stable NSs protein located in the nucleus in the discussion [78]. Thus, it might be possible that NSs encoding 20 aa. does not change the nuclear localization. On the other hand, NS\u03946\u201330, NS\u039431\u201355, NS\u039456\u201380 and NS\u0394249\u2013265, all of which encode SAP30-binding domain at aa.210\u2013130, could be accumulated in nucleus, whereas they did not inhibit IFN-\u03b2 gene, suggesting that NSs has another structural requirement to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 gene activation in addition to SAP30 binding. The requirement of NSs localization and IFN-\u03b2 gene suppression should be further studied to understand the detailed mechanism of IFN-\u03b2 gene regulation by RVFV NSs.",

On the other hand, the NSs-E253-255A accumulated efficiently in cells, and showed a similar phenotype with authentic NSs. Thus, the aspartic acids at 257\u2013259 but not glutamic acid at 253\u2013255 must be important for the stability of NSs. Since the accumulation of NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A and NSsD257-259A were very low, we could not determine whether those mutants are lacking the functions to degrade PKR or inhibit IFN-\u03b2 mRNA synthesis.",

This effect may possibly occur at the transcription or translation level rather than post-translation level, since MP-12 NSs can also accumulate with truncated NSs when RNA transfection was used for truncated NSs expression. If a selective viral transcription of truncated NSs mRNA, or a selective translation of truncated NSs proteins could occur in co-infected cells, then a virus exhibiting these traits may be useful for post-exposure vaccination. However, new studies will be required to detail this mechanism.",
