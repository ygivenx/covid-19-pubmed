Besides the issue of bacterial pneumonia, which represents a frequent cause of mortality in paediatric populations of developing countries, there is an increasing interest in the epidemiology and characterization of Influenza Like Illnesses (ILIs), which are predominantly of viral aetiology\n[4]. First, ILIs are responsible for a large number of cases in all age groups (with a specifically high frequency in children) and despite their frequent association with a mild clinical presentation, their medical and socio-economical impact is enormous\n[5]. Second, a proportion of ILIs is associated with severe clinical evolution\n[6]. In adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. Dual viral infections are common, and a large proportion of children have evidence of viral-bacterial co-infection\n[4]. Deciphering the epidemiological and pathophysiological links between viral primary infection and secondary bacterial super-infection and pneumonia currently represents a major challenge for improving the prevention and medical management of pneumonia.",

We did not attempt to build a representative sample of specimens received at CENETROP (supposedly poorly representative of ILIs in the general population of Santa Cruz), but rather examined a similar number of samples in each age group to allow a comprehensive aetiological analysis in all age classes. Our final sample has equivalent numbers of swabs in the 0\u20139, 10\u201319, 20\u201329 and 30\u201339 age classes (90 to 98 per class) but slightly lower numbers in the older classes (40\u201349: 70; 50\u201359: 59; \u226560: 61) due to the limited number of samples received at CENETROP for these age groups. As expected, it under-represents the 0\u20139 years old (yo) age group (which includes ~35% of eligible samples received), and over-represents the 30\u201339, 40\u201349, 50\u201359 and \u226560 yo age groups (Additional file\n1). The general characteristics and distribution of cases are presented in Table \n1. The gender ratio (M/F) is 0.84 and the history of influenza vaccination clearly shows that a limited proportion of the population received influenza vaccines, in particular in the elderly (0.53% have received at least one dose of influenza vaccine in their life in the \u226560 yo age group).",

In 2011 and 2012, the number of samples studied annually was lower (163 and 144, respectively), but still sufficient to elucidate the main peaks of activity with a major incidence of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2011 and Flu B in 2012, co-circulating with a variety of other viruses (see Figure \n2C). Epidemiological peaks were generally associated with a predominant virus (Flu B in March 2010, hRV in August 2010, Flu A/H3N2 in November 2010, Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 in October 2011 and Flu B in March 2012), but the co-circulation of other viruses was the general rule (with the exception of Flu A/H3N2 in November 2010) and peaks also included 30-50% of infections by different viruses.",

In 2010, following the 2009 Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic wave, influenza A infections were for the most part due to Flu A/H3N2 and associated to a large number of Flu B and rhinovirus infections and a variety of less prevalent viruses. By contrast, year 2011 was characterised by the massive come back of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09, the low number of Flu B, the emergence of a large number of hCoV E229&OC43 infections and the absence of hRSV infections. In 2012, the situation changed again with a large number of Flu B and hRSV infections and the persistence of a significant proportion of rhinovirus and Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 infections. Altogether, this provides a striking picture of a moving infection pattern, which is presumably modelled by the herd immunity in the most epidemiologically susceptible populations. The complete disappearance of hRSV infections in 2011 represents a specific case that was never encountered by the authors in Europe.",

Both of them frequently co-circulate during epidemic periods\n[9] and segment reassortment between strains of both lineages is frequent, making it difficult to produce robust complete-genome phylogenetic analyses. Here, evolutionary trees were reconstructed from the alignment of 485 HA sequences and showed that ten out of the eleven 2010 and 2012 Bolivian Flu B strains studied were in the Victoria/87 lineage, and one (2012) in the Yamagata/88 lineage. Victoria-related Bolivian isolates appear in two distinct clusters, together with other South American isolates (Figure \n3). The first cluster, supported by a 98% bootstrap resampling value (Additional file\n2), includes the 2012 Bolivian isolates, together with a vast majority of Central and South American isolates in the 2010\u20132012 period and a limited number of isolates from different origin (Asia, North America, Australia). According to the tree topology, the 2012 South American cluster may originate from 2010 Australian isolates (observed both at the root and within this cluster). The second cluster, supported by a 100% bootstrap value (Additional file\n3), includes the 2010 Bolivian isolates, together with other Bolivian and South American isolates in the same period. The third cluster (within the Yagamata lineage), supported by a 94% bootstrap value (Additional file\n4), seems to be issued from 2007 Asian isolates and includes one 2012 Bolivian isolate, together with a variety of other Bolivian, Central and South American, North American and Asian isolates in the 2007\u20132012 period.",

Firstly, the great year-to-year variation of infection epidemiological patterns is a reminder that the epidemiology of ILIs should be studied over long periods of time. Each of the three years studied here would have provided, if analysed separately, a partial view of the situation and would have lead to erroneous conclusions (e.g., the absence of hRSV infections in Bolivian children extrapolated from 2011 data). The analysis of a 3-year period is expected to smooth such epidemiological jolts but an extended observation period would have undoubtedly revealed more information about the viruses that circulated at low rates in the period studied (e.g., parechoviruses, parainfluenzaviruses). Secondly, Bolivia includes territories with diverse geographical, climatic and ecological characteristics. Santa Cruz is located in an eastern low-altitude area with a humid tropical climate whilst La Paz is in a western Andean high-altitude area with a colder and dryer climate\n[11]. This may explain important epidemiological differences observed between both cities, as exemplified by the case of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09: in 2010, we observed a very limited number of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 infections in Santa Cruz whilst the PAHO surveillance system reported an intense circulation of the virus in La Paz during the first months of the year (PAHO surveillance website: http://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/ed_flu.asp); in 2011, a large outbreak occurred in Santa Cruz (see Figures \n1 and\n2), whilst only a few cases were observed in La Paz; in 2012, an important outbreak was observed in La Paz, but not in Santa Cruz. This clearly indicates that epidemiological data collected in Santa Cruz cannot be extrapolated easily to the Andean regions of Bolivia. Divergent influenza epidemiological patterns according to geographical distribution were finely documented in a previous Peruvian study\n[7].",

However, precise comparison with data collected in South America is most often difficult, e.g., with a molecular study in Ecuador\n[8] and a previous large study in Peru\n[7] (different periods investigated, viruses detected using immunofluorescence tests, parechoviruses, coronaviruses, metapneumoviruses and rhinoviruses not tested).",
