ACE2 was discovered as a human homolog of ACE in 20004,5. ACE2 is a negative regulator of the RAS, which catalyzes the conversion of Ang II to angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang 1\u20137) and downregulates Ang II levels, thereby counterbalancing ACE activity4\u20136.",

Although activation of the RAS and generation of Ang II worsen cardiovascular pathologies, such as cardiac fibrosis and pathological hypertrophy in heart failure, the enzymatic activity of ACE2 exhibits a protective role in cardiovascular diseases9,10. ACE2 also has protective roles to improve the pathologies in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury and diabetic nephropathy, in which Ang II is overproduced or its signaling enhanced11\u201313. Loss of ACE2 can be detrimental, as it leads to progression of cardiac, renal, and pulmonary pathologies11,14,15. Treatment with recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, and so forth11,13,16. rhACE2 is currently tested in the clinic to treat ARDS patients17. Despite its beneficial effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein and thus its preparation requires time- and cost-consuming protein expression system with mammalian or insect cells, which may not be advantageous in drug development and medical economy6,18\u201320.",

Structural analyses had revealed significant homology between ACE and a carboxypeptidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pfu (Pyrococcus furiosus), which is a member of the M32 family of carboxypeptidases belonging to the family of metallopeptidases with the HEXXH active-site motif21. The two enzymes share little amino acid sequence identity, yet they exhibit similarities in core structure and the active-site regions21. In addition, a structural similarity within the active-site region between ACE2 and the M32 carboxypeptidase from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been reported21, suggesting that the functions might be conserved.

            "text": "To address whether there are any ACE2-like proteins in bacteria, we first searched published crystal structures of M32 carboxypeptidase in the database of MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/) and found that three microbial M32 carboxypeptidases are reported for their three-dimensional (3D) structures, including BS-CAP (or BsuCP) (B. subtilis), Taq (Thermus aquaticus), and Pfu (P. furiosus). Although BS-CAP, Taq, or Pfu showed low sequence identity to ACE2, we examined whether BS-CAP, Taq, or Pfu has structural similarity to human ACE2 by using the program of Molecular Operating Environment (Chemical Computing Group, Canada). The program detected only BS-CAP as a protein structurally related to ACE2 and the 3D structures of both proteins are mostly merged (Fig. 1a). Importantly, the position of key amino acids constituting the catalytic site (His-Glu-X-X-His motif) and substrate-binding region (Arg273/348, His345/234, His505/408, and Tyr515/420 in ACE2/BS-CAP) were almost identical between both proteins, implicating that BS-CAP may have similar substrate preference to ACE2 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Table 1). Indeed, a previous study on BS-CAP structure had predicted that there may be structural similarity between ACE2 and BS-CAP24. We further searched for bacterial proteins that exhibit high sequence identity to BS-CAP in the BLAST and found that BA-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is homologous to BS-CAP (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, we found that our recently identified bacterial strain, Paenibacillus sp. B38, also has a similar M32 carboxypeptidase to BS-CAP with high sequence identity (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Table 1). We termed this Paenibacillus sp. B38-derived M32 carboxypeptidase as B38-CAP hereafter. Despite evolutionally distant relationship to ACE2 (Fig. 1b), these bacterial enzymes are likely homologs of ACE2 with divergent evolution.",

            "text": "We prepared recombinant proteins of BS-CAP, BA-CAP, and B38-CAP in the Escherichia coli protein expression system (Fig. 1c) and all of the proteins were highly expressed and soluble in E. coli and easily purified with anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Indeed, the production of recombinant B38-CAP in E. coli (16.8 mg protein yield per culture volume (L)) was more efficient in terms of the recovered protein amount compared with the production of His-tagged rhACE2 in baculovirus-Sf9 insect cells (5.42 mg protein yield per culture volume (L)). Moreover, the time for culture and purification of B38-CAP (2 days) was shorter than that of rhACE2 (6 days, not including baculovirus preparation) (Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013d). We first tested whether these enzymes have ACE2-like proteolytic activity to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptide Nma-His-Pro-Lys(Dnp), which we had previously developed as a specific ACE2 substrate19. As a result, all the enzymes were revealed to catalyze the hydrolysis of the ACE2 substrate Nma-His-Pro-Lys(Dnp) (Fig. 1d and Table 1). When we incubated Ang II peptide with BS-CAP, BA-CAP, or B38-CAP in vitro, all of the enzymes converted Ang II to Ang 1\u20137 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the dependency of ACE2-like enzymatic activity on anion (Cl\u2212) concentration is much higher in B38-CAP than in BS-CAP and BA-CAP (Fig. 1d), suggesting that B38-CAP is the most potent in ACE2-like activity under physiological conditions of mammals. Analysis for kinetic constants with the fluorogenic ACE2 substrate revealed that B38-CAP has the same potency as rhACE2 protein (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Consistently, the IC50 values of ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) for B38-CAP and human ACE2 were almost equivalent (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3c). In addition, the dependence of B38-CAP proteolytic activity on pH and temperature was also similar to that of ACE26,19 (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). Moreover, when various ACE2-substrate biological peptides were treated with B38-CAP, all the peptides tested were C-terminally cleaved by B38-CAP (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4a). For non-ACE2-substrate peptides Ang 1\u20137 and angiotensin 1\u20139 (Ang 1\u20139), however, B38-CAP did cleave Ang 1\u20139, whereas it did not affect Ang 1\u20137 (Fig. 1f, g and Table 2). Consistently, B38-CAP converted Ang I to Ang 1\u20137 (Fig. 1h), which is distinct from ACE2 conversion of Ang I to Ang 1\u201394. To address how B38-CAP converts Ang I to Ang 1\u20137, we conducted kinetic analysis (Fig. 1i, j and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Ang 1\u20139, Ang II, and Ang 1\u20137 peptides were detectable at 10 min after mixing Ang I with B38-CAP (Fig. 1j). Ang 1\u20137 production increased and finally reached the same levels of the initial Ang I amount, whereas Ang I was undetectable at 90 min (Fig. 1i, j). On the other hand, Ang 1\u20139 and Ang II exhibited a minor peak at 20 min and 60 min, respectively, and both peptides became undetectable at the end of the reaction period (Fig. 1j). Consistent with peptide kinetics, the amino acids leucine (Leu), histidine (His), and phenylalanine (Phe) were generated in the same order as mono-carboxyl proteolysis of Ang I, Ang 1\u20139, and Ang II, respectively (Fig. 1j), indicating that the conversion of Ang I to Ang 1\u20137 by B38-CAP is mediated through three steps of mono-carboxyl proteolysis. Therefore, B38-CAP has an ACE2-like activity, which converts both Ang II and Ang I peptides to Ang 1\u20137 in vitro.",

            "text": "To examine the effects of B38-CAP in vivo, we first injected B38-CAP into mice and measured plasma enzymatic activity as indicative of the plasma B38-CAP levels by using a newly developed B38-CAP-specific substrate Nma-Leu-Pro-Lys(Dnp). In 1 h after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of B38-CAP (2 mg kg\u22121 i.p.), the concentration of B38-CAP in plasma was markedly increased and peaked (Fig. 2a). The plasma B38-CAP levels gradually decreased to almost baseline at 8 h but it was still detectable in the plasma through 12 h (Fig. 2a). Estimated initial half-life in systemic circulation was 3.5 h, which is almost similar to 1.8\u20138.5 h of rhACE225,26. We next examined whether B38-CAP treatment affects Ang II-induced elevation of BP. We first measured the BP in the carotid artery in anesthetized mice using a transducer catheter (Fig. 2b). Intraperitoneal injection of Ang II (0.2 mg kg\u22121 i.p.) induced acute elevation of arterial BP in wild-type mice, whereas pretreatment of B38-CAP (2 mg kg\u22121 i.p.) significantly suppressed the Ang II-induced elevation of arterial pressure (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 5a\u2013c). We next addressed the effects of B38-CAP on hypertension induced by chronic Ang II treatment. Although continuous infusion of Ang II with an osmotic mini-pump elevated BP as measured in conscious mice, daily i.p. injection of B38-CAP downregulated elevation of BP at days 8, 14, and 28 (Supplementary Fig. 6a\u2013e and Supplementary Fig. 7a\u2013e). Furthermore, we tested whether continuous infusion of B38-CAP suppresses Ang II-induced hypertension (Fig. 2d). When B38-CAP was infused subcutaneously using an osmotic mini-pump, B38-CAP was detectable in the plasma of mice for 14 days (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Although it had been reported that an immune response is associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not observed for B38-CAP; there were no antibodies against B38-CAP detectable in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Implantation of B38-CAP-filled osmotic mini-pumps significantly suppressed Ang II-induced hypertension in conscious mice (Fig. 2e\u2013g) without affecting the heart rate (Fig. 2h). These results indicate that B38-CAP antagonizes the vasopressor effect of Ang II.",

In the acute experiment with i.p. injection of Ang II (Fig. 2b), pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly downregulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II levels at 5 min after Ang II injection (Fig. 2i). Consistently, in the chronic experiment with continuous infusion of Ang II (Fig. 2d), continuous infusion of B38-CAP with additional osmotic pump significantly decreased Ang II levels in the plasma at day 14 (Fig. 2j). As Ang 1\u20137 is known to exert beneficial effects in the cardiovascular systems through Mas/Ang 1\u20137 receptor27, we also measured Ang 1\u20137 levels in the plasma of these mice. Ang 1\u20137 levels in the plasma were significantly upregulated in both acute and chronic experimental settings (Fig. 2k, l). On the other hand, when we co-treated the Ang II-injected mice with B38-CAP and A779, an antagonist for Mas/Ang 1\u20137 receptor, the suppressive effects of B38-CAP on Ang II-induced elevation of BP were not affected (Fig. 2m and Supplementary Fig. 9a\u2013d). Furthermore, co-treatment of Ang 1\u20137 and Ang II did not downregulate Ang II-induced elevation of BP (Supplementary Fig. 9e\u2013h). Thus, the hypotensive effects of B38-CAP are primarily mediated through downregulation of Ang II levels.",

When BP was elevated after 7 days of Ang II infusion, daily i.p. injection of B38-CAP was initiated (Fig. 7a). B38-CAP treatment significantly downregulated Ang II-induced increase of BP to the levels in vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 7b\u2013e). Thus, B38-CAP ameliorated established hypertension. Next, we investigated the effects of B38-CAP on established cardiac dysfunction. At 5 weeks after TAC surgery, the mice (C57BL/6J background) exhibits cardiac dysfunction with significant decrease of %FS (Fig. 7f, g). The osmotic mini-pumps containing B38-CAP or vehicle were implanted at this time point and B38-CAP (2 mg kg\u22121 per day) was infused for 2 weeks. Treatment with B38-CAP significantly increased %FS as compared with that in vehicle-treated mice or in the mice before treatment (Fig. 7g and Table 3), indicating that B38-CAP improved cardiac dysfunction. In addition, cardiac hypertrophy was significantly suppressed by B38-CAP treatment (Fig. 7h\u2013j) and pulmonary congestion was also improved by B38-CAP (Fig. 4k, l). Consistently, B38-CAP treatment significantly downregulated increased expression of mRNA associated with the pathology of cardiac hypertrophy (BNP and \u03b2-myhc) and fibrosis (Col8a1, Postn, and Tgfb2) (Fig. 7m\u2013q). Furthermore, we challenged B38-CAP to severe cardiac dysfunction in C57BL/6N mice under TAC, in which the mice exhibit profound decline of cardiac contractility at 2 weeks after TAC (Fig. 4l and Supplementary Fig. 10a\u2013c). When B38-CAP treatment was started at 2 weeks after TAC, B38-CAP markedly suppressed progression of heart failure in C57BL/6N mice (Supplementary Fig. 10b\u2013o and Supplementary Table 5), albeit mainly through decrease of LV dimensions rather than wall thickness.

B38-CAP also showed pH optimum of 7.5 equivalent to rhACE26,19. In addition, IC50 of MLN-4760 was also equivalent between rhACE2 and B38-CAP. Although B38-CAP exhibited quite similar proteolytic activity to rhACE2, there seems a difference in substrate specificity between two enzymes. B38-CAP is likely to have more broad specificity for proteolytic effects on peptides, because B38-CAP converted Ang I and Ang 1\u20139 into Ang 1\u20137, whereas ACE2 does not cleave Ang 1\u20139. The superimposition of ACE2 and BS-CAP structures indicated that the positions of substrate-binding amino acid residues and metal-binding residues are matched. Although the ACE2 substrate Nma-His-Pro-Lys(Dnp) was cleaved by B38-CAP with the same potency as ACE2, we found that the Nma-Leu-Pro-Lys(Dnp) was catalyzed specifically by B38-CAP but not by ACE2 (not shown), suggesting that the S2-subsite of B38-CAP is more hydrophobic than ACE2. The difference in substrate specificity of B38-CAP and ACE2 should be further elucidated by our ongoing analysis for crystal structure of B38-CAP.",

            "text": "Although the hypotensive action of B38-CAP is mediated mainly through Ang II downregulation, B38-CAP (2 ~ 3 mg kg\u22121 per day) exhibits a more potent therapeutic effect in TAC-induced heart failure than in Ang II-induced heart failure (e.g., 87.9% inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy (HW/BW increase) in TAC model vs. 53.2% inhibition in Ang II-infusion model). On the other hand, in a previous study, rhACE2 showed similar anti-hypertrophic effects in both TAC and Ang II-infusion models16. The difference may be explained by the slight difference of substrate specificity of B38-CAP and ACE2. Although ACE2 converts Ang I to Ang 1\u20139 inefficiently and requires ACE for further conversion of Ang 1\u20139 to Ang 1\u201376, B38-CAP targets all the Ang I, Ang 1\u20139, and Ang II peptides as a mono-carboxypeptidase. Thus, the conversion of Ang I and Ang II to Ang 1\u20137 by B38-CAP may contribute to more efficient down-modulation of RAS in the TAC heart failure. In addition, Ang 1\u20137 is a vasoprotective peptide which acts through its cognate Mas receptor, and also has anti-fibrotic and cardioprotective functions in heart failure10. Thus, B38-CAP-mediated degradation of Ang I into Ang 1\u20137 would be beneficial in enhancing Ang 1\u20137 generation for treating failing hearts. Furthermore, as ACE2 and B38-CAP target other biological peptides than angiotensin peptides, subtle differences in substrate specificity may license B38-CAP to degrade such peptides in a different manner or even to have a new peptide substrate different from ACE2 targets.",

On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity of B38-CAP in mouse heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial carboxypeptidases in disease models.

In prevention experiments, treatment with B38-CAP was initiated at the same time as implantation of Ang II-filled osmotic mini-pumps or completion of TAC surgery30. For co-infusion of Ang II and B38-CAP into the subcutaneous of mice for 2 weeks (Fig. 2d\u2013h and Fig. 3), Ang II and B38-CAP were loaded into individual pumps and the mice were implanted with the two pumps. When Ang II was infused for 4 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 7), Ang II-filled osmotic mini-pumps (Alzet model 1002) were replaced with a new one at 2 weeks after implantation. Two or 4 weeks after treatment, BP measurement and echocardiography were performed.
