Among these viruses, the positive rate of PEDV is relatively higher in the whole world and it causes considerable economic losses to pig-production in recent years [6]. PEDV is the major causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which was first discovered in the United Kingdom in 1971, afterwards this pathogen spread throughout European and Asian countries, such as the Belgium, United States, Japan, Korean, China and Vietnam, resulting in serious damage to pig producers [7\u201312]. This disease is clinically characterized by vomiting, dehydration and severe watery diarrhea. Pigs of any age could be infected by PEDV, from newborn pigs to boars or sows. In sucking piglets, the morality rate can reach 80%-100% [6].",

            "text": "PED is indistinguishable from other porcine diarrheal diseases including TGE and rotavirus diarrhea based on clinical symptoms and necropsy. Therefore, it is necessary to definitely identify the causative pathogen using confirmatory laboratory tests, which is essential for timely clinical decision-making and management of epidemics of PED [13]. Commonly used laboratory diagnostic methods of PEDV include antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatography assay (IC), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR and nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay and so forth [14\u201320]. Currently, ELISA and IC have been widely applied to detect PEDV in large-scale blood or feces samples. In these two methods, a highly specific monoclonal antibody targeted to one viral epitope needs to be designed and produced, so they are not able to detect some of the PEDV strains when lacking specific detection antibody. Additionally, in initial stage of PEDV infection the virus titer is relatively low, so ELISA and IC sometimes may not detect the presence of PEDV. Nucleic acids based detection approaches (RT-LAMP and real-time RT-PCR) gain more sensitivity than antigen-based methods (ELISA and IC), but they also have some shortcomings which hinders its wide application. For example, RT-LAMP has a strict demand for designing specific primers and the identification of LAMP products is not easy because of products contamination. In addition, real-time RT-PCR requires special instruments and dye-labeled probes, making them unsuitable in clinical practice. Nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay is an advanced form of PCR in which nanoparticles are used to increase thermal conductivity, and the sensitivity of this method is 100-fold that of conventional RT-PCR [20]. However, existing established PCR-based assays of detecting PEDV need RNA extraction, purification and reverse transcription of RNA, which are time-consuming and laborious. Moreover, during this complicated process, RNA is more likely to be degraded by RNAase in the environment. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and economical method, allowing for point-of-care (POC) detection of PEDV.",

Recently, nanoparticles in different sizes, materials and shapes have been increasingly applied in developing biosensors for detecting pathogens and corresponding antibodies or specific biomarkers on cells. In our study, a functionalized nanoparticles-based PCR method (UNDP-PCR) was developed to identify PEDV infection in preclinical stool samples, in which magnetic microparticles and gold nanoparticles are employed. PEDV, as one of the members of family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 28kb. From 5\u2019 cap to the 3\u2019 poly A tail. PEDV genomic RNA consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs), encoding viral replicase, spike protein (S), ORF3, envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) in sequence. Unlike other proteins, ORF1a gene encoding viral replicase 1a only exists in genomic RNA (gRNA) and has low-level genetic mutations [24, 25]. Therefore, PEDV specific probes and oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of the conserved region of ORF1a, which could quantify infectious viral particles accurately. Via systematical optimization, magnetic microparticles (MMPs) coated with PEDV specific probes and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with PEDV specific oligos were used to enrich viral genomic RNA and amplify weak viral signals from fecal samples. Then MMPs-RNA-AuNPs complexes were formed, plenty of DNA barcodes on the surface of gold nanoparticles were released and characterized by PCR. Therefore, the established UNDP-PCR assay for PEDV is fit for diagnosis of PEDV in early stage of viral infection, possessing higher sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility.",

Fresh fecal samples were collected from individual pigs on farms, placed in sterile specimen cups, kept on ice, and returned to the laboratory within 12 h. Then stool samples (weight: about 1g) were diluted in PBS buffer, followed by vortex and centrifugation at 4,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to eliminate fecal debris. Then the supernatants of per gram stool samples were tested using conventional RT-PCR, SYBR Green real-time PCR and UNDP-PCR for PEDV, respectively.

In consideration of the binding stability, difficulty degree of hybridization and mismatch rates, the designed PEDV specific primers used in UNDP-PCR assay do not contain more than three continuous nucleotides (G/C/A/T) and their GC content is over 40%,. In addition, because of steric hinerance and capture efficiency, the distance of every pair of primers is between 500\u2013600 bp. Relying on these selecting principles, 8 pairs of PEDV specific primers were designed (16 targeted sequence sites in total). In addition, PEDV specific primers used in conventional RT-PCR detection method were designed using Primer Premier and Primer-blast software according to PEDV highly conserved sequences in replicase protein-encoding region ORF1a. Previously published primers for conventional PCR/RT-PCR method of detecting PRRSV, TGEV, PCV2, CSFV and PPV were used in the present study [32, 33]. All the probes, oligos and primers presented in Tables 1 and 2 were specific to the targeting gene sequences and synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China) and Genscript (Nanjing, China).",

However, the 3\u2019 one-third encodes nonstructural protein (ORF3) and structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, existing in both genomic RNAs (gRNAs) and subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) [36].

The experimental results indicated that all 16 designed probes were capable of capturing RNA of PEDV. Among them, MMP-p1 and MMP-p2 showed higher efficiency in capturing PEDV genome (Fig 2A). Next, SH-modified oligonucleotides (oligos) 1\u201316 sharing same nucleic acid sequences of probe 1\u201316 were coated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to prepare AuNPs-oligo1 to 16.

Therefore, the PEDV positive detection rate of UNDP-PCR, conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR were 30.72%, 5.88% and 17.65% respectively. Next, to determine the viral loads in PEDV positive fecal samples, relative band intensities of 20 samples selected from 47 PEDV positive samples were compared with that of standard PEDV samples (104, 103, 102 copies per gram). As shown in Fig 5B, among the 20 PEDV positive samples, 4 sample was over 104 copies/g, 4 samples were between 104 and 103 copies/g, 10 samples were between 103 and 102 copies/g, and 2 samples were below 102 copies/g.",

            "text": "In this study, a UNDP-PCR assay for PEDV was successfully developed by adopting technology advances in nanotechnology and optimized by selecting specific probes for enrichment of viral nucleic acids. Therefore, this method gains more merits than existing laboratory detection methods of PEDV. Firstly, the developed PEDV UNDP-PCR assay has higher sensitivity. Accordingly, functionalized magnetic beads and nanoparticles were used to facilitate binding between viral nucleic acids and PEDV specific probes. Then, large number of DNA barcodes carried by probe-coated AuNPs were diluted and detected as templates for PCR. Obviously, the weak viral signals in small amount of fecal samples were highly amplified, resulting in that 25 viral copies of PEDV in per gram fecal samples could be detected. However, PEDV infection could only be detected by conventional RT-PCR methods when virus titer is over 104 copies per gram fecal samples. Obviously, the functionalized nanoparticles-based PCR detection method for PEDV is approximately 400-fold more sensitive than that of conventional RT-PCR. Therefore, PEDV infection could be timely monitored by this method, especially in early stage of infection, which would be helpful for preventing virus particles from spreading to other pig farms. Secondly, to determine specificity of this functionalized nanoparticles-based detection method, other viruses such as TGEV, PCV2, CSFV, PPV and PRRSV which are likely to cause co-infection in pigs were examined. No amplification was obtained from these viruses, suggesting that this method has a high level of specificity for PEDV. To ensure diagnosis precision, specific DNA probes bound to magnetic microparticles and gold nanoparticles are designed targeting two distinct highly conserved sequences in viral ORF1a region, and then were selected through systematical optimization according to specific selection principles, such as capture efficiency, steric hinerance effect and so on. In addition, unlike commonly used commercial ELISA kits for PEDV, almost all PEDV strains could be detected by this assay, due to the fact that specific probes used to form sandwich-like complex with viral nucleic acids are directed against highly conserved region of PEDV ORF1a. In addition, large-scale preclinical stool samples could be detected simultaneously without the need for RNA extraction and reverse transcription in the same reaction system, so the whole detection process of UNDP-PCR for PEDV could be completed in a short period of time, and provide the viral loads in PEDV positive fecal samples. Therefore, this developed assay saves time, money and labor, showing a wide detection range and the potential for clinical application. However, as a new method, the optimization of reaction system and condition is a long and complicated process. Therefore, how to make this method more convenient will be the next thing we need to do.",
