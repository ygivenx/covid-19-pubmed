            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, positive-sense and single stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus. PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a historic, highly contagious enteric swine disease characterized by diarrhea, dehydration and poor growth performance in pigs at all ages [1,2]. PED was first identified in 1971 in the United Kingdom, and subsequently became an endemic disease in the Europe and most Asian countries with a low mortality rate and limited economic losses [1]. For decades, the disease was controlled through the use of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) derived from the PEDV prototypes, CV777- or DR13. Unfortunately, in late 2010, a new highly virulent PEDV strain emerged in China and quickly spread worldwide, including Taiwan [3,4]. Moreover, the conventional LAV failed to induce protection against this new virulent PEDV strain, consequently resulting in nearly 100% mortality amongst neonatal piglets and leading to substantial economic impacts on swine markets in the affected regions [5]. Phylogenetic analysis categorizes PEDV into two genogroups [2]. Genogroup I consists primarily of the historic, low-virulent PEDV strains that appeared around 1970, whereas genogroup II is composed of the highly virulent PEDV strains, which emerged after 2010s. Both genogroups can be further divided into two subgroups each, namely G1a, G1b, G2a and G2b though a recent phylogenetic study identified a novel recombinant PEDV strain classified into a new G1c clade [6].",

            "text": "The complete genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kilobase pairs and consists of seven open reading frames (ORF). Out of the seven, four ORFs are responsible for encoding structural proteins, namely the spike (S) glycoprotein as well as envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which are crucial for viral morphogenesis and establishment of infection establishment [7]. Among all coronaviruses, S glycoprotein plays a particularly essential role in cell-virus interaction and acts as the vital determinants of viral virulence/attenuation [8,9,10]. S glycoprotein is a homotrimeric type I fusion protein, which can be cleaved into two parts\u2014the S1 and S2 subunits\u2014by cellular protease [11]. The S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and several neutralizing epitopes that are essential for determining host and tissue tropism, and triggering protective host immunity, respectively. Therefore, the S1 subunit has long been considered to be the primary target for vaccine development. The S2 domain, on the other hand, mediates membrane fusion which facilitates release of viral RNA and infection to the neighboring cells [8].",

Therefore, to combat the emergence of PED as well as to immediately suppress any future outbreaks, studies have been carried out to develop safe and effective vaccines [13,14]. Aside from serial cell culture or animal passages, the reverse genetic system, which rescues genetically modified attenuated viruses, is now the common approach in generating LAV candidates for both human and animal viral diseases, including PEDV [15,16]. To this end, understanding the molecular biology and identification of virulent/attenuating determinant(s) are necessary for the rational design of potential LAV candidates. Comparison of the genomic differences between the Vero cell-cultured attenuated G2b PEDV and their corresponding parental virulent strains has revealed a common pattern of mutation that particularly affects the S gene [12]. While the observation is reasonable considering the fundamental role of S protein in PEDV infection and induction of host immunity, a recent publication found that a singular S gene exchange had no influence on the virulence of the highly virulent G2b BJ2011C strain and avirulent G1a CHM2013 strain [17].",

Nonetheless, our findings were discordant with previous reported data [17]. We found that replacement of the S gene with the iPEDVPT-P5 virus enabled iPEDVPT-P96 to regain its virulence. A reciprocal approach revealed that iPEDVPT-P5 virus became partly attenuated after the S gene was exchanged to iPEDVPT-P96. Collectively, we concluded that the S gene is of critical importance to the attenuation process of the PEDVPT 52 strain. However, mutation in the S gene alone could not completely attenuate the iPEDVPT-P5 virus. Thus, gene(s) other than S gene could also play a role in determining the virulence.",

The approach to constructing a cDNA clone of iPEDVPT-P5 was technically identical to that of the iPEDVPT-P96. However, we split the plasmid B into two fragments because the sequence remained toxic to the One Shot\u2122 TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) despite propagation in LB broth supplemented with 10% SOC medium and being incubated at 30 \u00b0C. To generate chimeric viruses carrying heterologous spike (S) genes, namely the iPEDVPT-P5-96S and iPEDVPT-P96-5S, cDNA clones of iPEDVPT-P5 and iPEDVPT-P96, respectively, were used as the backbones. The sequences covering the complete S gene of each virus were exchanged without disruption to the remaining genomic structure. Sequence differences in the S genes of iPEDVPT-P5 and iPEDVPT-P96 viruses are summarized in Table 1. Each plasmid was digested with corresponding type-IIS restriction enzymes as designated in Figure S1, gel-purified, assembled and phenol-chloroform extracted to generate the full-length cDNAs. The cDNAs were then in vitro transcribed to the full-length RNA transcripts using a mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, CA, USA) and immediately electroporated into 800 \u03bcL of 107 cells/mL Vero cells in RNase-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) along with 5 \u03bcg of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) transcripts. After electroporation, the cells were allowed to recover in growth medium for approximately 16 h and then maintained in PI-medium until cytopathic effects involved over 90% of cell monolayers. The whole flasks were subjected to one freeze-and-thaw cycle and the rescued viruses were passaged once to generate viral stocks (P1). The viral stocks were titrated on Vero cells in 96-well plates to determine the viral titer (see below).",

Moreover, other emerging and re-emerging swine enteric coronaviruses, including porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) [24], and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) [25], further complicate the field condition by affecting diagnostic accuracy and increasing the risk of viral recombination [26]. Hence, there is still a pressing need to develop a safe and effective vaccine, particularly the LAV, to mount this disastrous disease. The reverse genetics system is a powerful and widely used tool to study viral pathogenesis and novel LAV design by active modification of genes of interests. Previous studies using reverse genetics on other coronaviruses have identified many virulent/attenuating determinants that might be shared among different genus of coronaviruses [12]. Nevertheless, direct evidences of attenuation due to harboring those mutated determinant(s) in pigs are still limited in PEDV [16,23,27]. In the present study, to investigate the role of the S gene in the attenuation process of the PEDVPT 52 strain, we generated four infectious cDNA clones of G2b PEDV, including the parental virulent iPEDVPT-P5, attenuated iPEDVPT-P96, as well as two chimeric viruses (iPEDVPT-P5-96S and iPEDVPT-P96-5S) with exchanged S gene. We found that the iPEDVPT-P96 virus fully regained the virulence after the exchange of S gene derived from the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5 virus, showing comparable patterns of viral shedding, diarrhea and histopathological changes. Our data confirmed that the S gene is the primary attenuating determinant of the iPEDVPT-P96 virus and the genetic backbone other than the S gene involving the attenuation of the iPEDVPT-P96 might be of less importance. However, the iPEDVPT-P5-96S still exhibited partial virulence resulting in severer villous attenuation and higher mortality rate compared to those caused by the iPEDVPT-P96 virus. This result supports that the virulence of PEDV might be a multigenic event. ",

            "text": "In the present study, the first pair of cDNA clones of a virulent G2b PEDV and its derived attenuated strain were generated. Since these two viruses were closely related to each other, this established platform would allow for easier manipulate in studying the effect of single nucleotide polymorphism for identifying potential virulent/attenuating determinate(s). In the present study, we demonstrated that reversion of virulence or attenuation occurred after the S gene was reciprocally replaced. However, this finding is in disagreement with previously published results by Wang et al. [17], indicating that there was an absence of virulence reversion after S gene substitution between the highly virulent G2b strain, BJ2011C, and the avirulent G1a strain, CHM2013. There could be a few reasons for the discrepancy between our observations that of previous studies. First, the autonomy of the viruses is different. Viral attenuation in serial cell-culture or animal passage is a progressive process that involves a series of gene mutations and the subsequent alternated cooperative interplay between gene products and mechanisms influencing cell-virus interaction. Although the patterns of attenuating mutation are similar among G2b PEDV strains, the asynchronous mutations between different PEDV strains could lead to loss of the cooperative or complementary function(s) for other gene products. In the previous study, the used viral strains belonged to different genogroups [17,28]. Efficient viral assembly requires proper signaling and interaction between each structural protein. Since the BJ2011C virus belonged to genogroup 2b, we speculated that the reason a singular S gene exchange failed to reverse the virulence of the avirulent G1a CHM2013 strain might be due to, at least in part, the suboptimal cooperation between structural proteins in terms of PEDV morphogenesis. Second, the degree of attenuation differed between the CHM2013 virus and PEDVPT-P96 virus. Comparing to the avirulent CHM2013 virus that induced no detectable viral shedding in two-day-old piglets, iPEDVPT-P96 virus retained some levels of virulence as it caused viral shedding, observable clinical symptoms, and even mortality in the seven-day-old conventional piglets. Besides the S gene [17,28], the abolishment of the function of non-structural proteins (NSPs) alone has been demonstrated to attenuate highly virulent PEDVs by disrupting the antagonistic ability of host interferons (IFN) [16,27]. That means, when the function of certain NSP was abated, PEDVs lose its virulence, regardless of the S gene they carry. Therefore, variations of NSPs in the CHM2013 virus might have a critical effect on its virulence, and the effect might be stronger than that contributed by the S gene derived from the highly virulent BJ2011C virus. Similarly, we also speculated that the IFN-suppressive function provided by NSP(s) might also contribute to virulent differences between the iPEDVPT-P5-96S and iPEDVPT-P96 since nine mutations were identified in NSPs in the iPEDVPT-P96 as compared with that of PEDVPT-P5 [18]. Regardless, further studies are needed to clarify the hypotheses mentioned above.",

            "text": "Sequence comparison between the autologous highly virulent PEDVPT-P5 and attenuated PEDVPT-P96 revealed several amino acid substitutions [18], especially in the S gene (see Table 1). Consistent with other studies, these mutations chiefly accumulated in the S2 domain, presumably because of adaptation to Vero cells [12,29]. In the present study, the enhanced fusogenic ability in vitro was distinctly ascribed to the S gene, more specifically the S2 domain, derived from iPEDVPT-P96 and presumably represented the evolutionary process to increase viral progeny since Vero cells are not of swine-origin but readily susceptible to PEDV infection. Animal experiments with seven-day-old piglets revealed that the exchange of the S gene from the iPEDVPT-P96 resulted in a delayed onset of peak viral shedding, diarrhea, and milder villous atrophy when examined histologically at 3 d post-inoculation. Additionally, in contrast to the findings published by Wang et al. [17], Suzuki et al. [30] reported that replacement of the entire S gene or S1 sequence from a highly virulent OKN-1/JPN/2013 American type PEDV strain enabled the attenuated rPEDVGFP-CV777 to acquire virulence in piglets. In iPEDVPT-P96 virus, however, only two amino acid substitutions were identified in the S10 (C144T) and S1B (T554C) domains compared to the iPEDVPT-P5 virus. For PEDV, S10 and S1B domains are known to contain sialic acid-binding and receptor-binding domains, respectively; thus, are crucial for viral entry [31]. Although Hou et al. [23] previously showed that deletion of 197 amino acids in S10 domain of PEDV resulted in attenuation in piglets, a more specific epitope has yet to be identified. Therefore, we are curious about whether only these two mutations in iPEDVPT-P96 can attenuate the highly virulent iPEDVPT-P5 virus or if the S2 domain must be primarily accounted for the attenuation. Future studies will be conducted to elucidate these questions.",
