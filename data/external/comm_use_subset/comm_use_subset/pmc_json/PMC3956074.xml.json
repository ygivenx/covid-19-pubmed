Early explorers like Columbus arrived at distant shores not only armed, but also infected with syphilis and other diseases which were then easily passed to local populations who had never previously been exposed to such diseases. More recently, the rapid and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003\u20132004 clearly illustrates the impact of human movement on disease dissemination: first detected in southern China in November 2003, within three months 305 cases were detected in a neighbouring state. By the next month, nine other countries were reporting SARS cases, and six months later it had become a global epidemic with 33 countries reporting over 8000 cases and a case fatality rate of just below 10% (WHO, 2003). Later phylogenetic analysis of the virus found a high probability that the SARS coronavirus originated in bats and spread to humans, either directly, or through animals kept in Chinese markets (Li et al., 2005).",

In 2007, a man infected with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, flew from Atlanta, Georgia to France and on to Greece and Italy, then returned on a flight from Prague, Czech Republic to Montreal, Canada where he crossed over the border back to the USA. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believed that he was suffering from extensively drug-resistant TB and a major alert was raised while the authorities attempted to find him. When he returned to the USA, he was placed under involuntary isolation, becoming the first person in the USA since 1963 to be subject to CDC isolation under the Public Health Service Act of 1944.",

A second way migration can act to speed transmission is if migration induces increased risk behaviour. For tuberculosis, for example, in Southern Africa, as we will see, migration not only links high transmission urban areas to previously uninfected rural ones, but it also exposes migrants to significantly higher risk at the workplace through factors like unclean working conditions, exposure to silica dust and overcrowded housing (McCulloch, 2012; Stuckler, Basu, McKee, & Lurie, 2011). A variety of additional theoretical frameworks have been proposed, but are beyond the scope of this paper (see, for example, Crush, Williams, Gouws, & Lurie, 2005; Deane, Parkhurst, & Johnston, 2010; Hirsch, 2013; Weine & Kashuba, 2012).",

Gold, discovered in South Africa in the late 1800s, fuelled a mass migration of young men from rural areas to work, temporarily, on the mines. They were labelled \u201ctemporary workers\u201d because the South African government worked hand-in-hand with mining authorities to devise a system to bring young black men from rural areas to work on the mines. But permanent residence on the mines was prohibited as the government sought to expand the separation of races (later codified and formalized as apartheid), while the mining companies sought to establish a system of migrant labour which would provide them with an adequate supply of workers. Furthermore, government and mining officials conspired to establish the system of circular of oscillating migration \u2013 in which men work on the mines for fixed periods, and then return home to their rural \u201chomelands\u201d. By design, the system was established to ensure the adequate supply of labour to the mines and also to absolve the mining companies of the long-term care of former miners (Lurie, 1992). By sending miners home after the conclusion of their work contracts, the mining companies conveniently externalized the long-term costs of caring for these often sick former workers, many of whom had contracted TB and silicosis on the mines during the periods of employment.",

As a result, millions of people were forced to migrate temporarily to \u201cwhite areas\u201d to work in the mines, industry, agriculture and in the domestic labour sectors. Permanent migration to \u201cwhites-only\u201d areas was strictly prohibited under apartheid laws, and even temporary entrance into \u201cwhites-only\u201d areas necessitated a stamp in ones ID or \u201cpassbook\u201d.",

By 1970, agricultural production in rural areas had declined to such an extent that only 10% of the total income for the majority of rural households came from agriculture (May, 1990) and rural residents had become increasingly dependent on remittances from their family and relatives working in urban areas. The majority of a rural households' income came instead from remittances by family members employed as migrant labour and in KwaZulu/Natal, for example, by the late 1980s remittances made up over three-quarters of rural household income (May, 1990).",

These changes are characterized by both an increase in the prevalence of female migration (Posel, 2006; Posel & Casale, 2003) and an increasing frequency with which migrants are able to return home (Crush, 1992). Prior to the 1970s, most work contracts on the gold mines were for six-month duration; over the following two decades, most labour contracts on the mines were lengthened and became highly stabilized (Crush, 1992). For example, in 1981, 59% of labour contracts on the gold mines were for 45 weeks and 19% were for 52 weeks. By 1987, 90% of labour contracts were for 52 weeks with only 7% being 45 weeks. As a result, net labour turnover on the mines decreased significantly, indicating longer work-stays, reduced turnover and greater workforce stability (Crush, 1992).",

Little is known, however, about the impact of increased frequency of returning home on HIV transmission, and increased frequency of return in this example could potentially be protective: if migrants return home more frequently, they are perhaps less likely to take additional sexual partners while away; conversely, the increased frequency of return could result in more frequent exposure of uninfected partners.",

That the mining camps were an early hot-spot for TB transmission should come as no surprise as the mines contained a lethal mix of conditions highly conducive to the spread of disease: lungs weakened by exposure to silica dust (which causes silicosis and renders people highly susceptible to TB), long hours working underground in extreme heat and under dusty conditions, and crowded housing arrangements that often saw more than 16 people sharing the same room.",

In addition, the policy of repatriating sick workers to rural areas \u201cguaranteed that the epidemic of urban-based TB quickly spread to the rural hinterlands\u201d (Packard, 1989) so that by the late 1920s, as many as 90% of the adult population living in the Transkei and Ciskei had been infected with TB.

For people with HIV/AIDS, taking lifesaving antiretroviral drugs is a daily event that should continue over the lifetime. Similarly, the treatment of obesity, diabetes and other chronic infections now becoming common in Southern Africa requires lifelong treatment. Yet, in the context of the continued large-scale human migration, important questions are now being raised about how people who are so mobile will be able to maintain lifelong treatment for these chronic infections. How do migrants negotiate access to care, for example, after the leave urban employment? How do people who migrate frequently negotiate daily pill regimens, and how and where do they decide to get treated. Do migrants prefer to access treatment for some diseases in rural areas, while for other diseases in urban areas? These and other related questions about the role of migration in accessing and negotiating treatment are among the new important questions raised by migration and health today. While we must still be interested in migration-induced disease \u2013 and in finding ways to mitigate the additional health risks of migration, we must increasingly turn our attention to disease-induced migration, where sick people may change their patters of migration in order to access quality care.",
