MEV, a subspecies of the feline parvovirus (FPV), contains a single-stranded negative sense DNA genome of about 5 kb, with 2 main open reading frames (ORFs) [1]. As do other parvoviruses, MEV causes a highly infectious acute disease and has a high rate of morbidity and mortality in mink [2]\u2013[4]. Certain MEV vaccines have been used with some success to prevent further spread of the viral disease with significant decreases in morbidity and mortality [1], [5]\u2013[8]. However, due to the genetic variability of the virus these vaccines are becoming increasingly inadequate and a simpler approach to controlling MEV infection would be advantageous.",

            "text": "miRNAs are endogenous small noncoding RNAs of length 18\u201323 nucleotides (nt), which play critical roles in many biological processes including cell proliferation, haematopoiesis and development of the nervous system [9]\u2013[11]. miRNAs work by basically two modes [12]\u2013[14]. In plants, they target mRNAs by precise or nearly precise complementary base pairing, and cleave target mRNAs directly [14]. In animals, being mostly imprecisely complementary to their mRNA targets, they often show translational repression and then lead to mRNA degradation [10], [15], [16]. Recent studies have also noted the role of miRNAs as modulators in host-pathogen interaction networks [17], [18]. Cellular miRNA hsa-miR-146a facilitates proliferation of Epstein-Barr (EB) virus by down regulation of an interferon-related gene [19]. Cellular hsa-miR-29a inhibits replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by targeting the viral Nef mRNA directly [20]. miR-323, miR-491 and miR-654 from both 293T and MDCK cells target the same region in H1N1 influenza virus PB1 mRNAs, thereby affecting the ability of the latter to replicate [21]. Virus-encoded miRNAs also play roles in viral infection. EB virus-derived miRNA miR-BART2 decreases replication of EB virus by targeting viral DNA polymerase BALF5 [22]. miR-BART22 helps EB virus evade the host immune response by reducing levels of EB virus latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) [23]. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoding miR-US25-1c blocks the cell cycle at the G1/S phase by down regulating cyclin E2, BRCC3, EID1, MAPRE2, and CD147 to help the virus create a cellular environment conducive to DNA replication [24].",

The resulting data was screened for miRNAs with more than a 2-fold change following MEV infection, and RNAhybrid [30] and RegRNA [31] tools were used to predict miRNA target sites on MEV mRNAs. Results indicated that 8 of such miRNAs might target MEV mRNAs (Figure 1). Among them, miR-181b showed comparatively the highest level expression (Table 2). To test whether endogenous (cellular) miR-181b was expressed at a high enough level (>100 copies/cell [34], [36]) to have any function, absolute qPCR analysis was performed. Results showed that the expression level of miR-181b was almost 800 copies/cell (>100 copies/cell) and more than that of miR-181c and miR-181d (Figure S1\nA) Prediction results also showed that miR-181b might target MEV NS1 at the 9 nucleotide sequence coding region (334\u2013342) of NS1 mRNA (Figure 1). This potential target site and the two flanking sequences are identical in all the known isolates of MEV, canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) including MEV strain L (Table 3).",

At the indicated times, virus titer and genomic DNA levels were examined. As anticipated, miR-181b mimics inhibited viral growth and this was most evident 36 h post MEV infection, at which time the virus titer was significantly suppressed almost 8-fold by miR-181b mimics, while the inhibitors tended to prevent the inhibitory activity of the endogenous miR-181b on viral growth but the effect was very minor and not significant (Figure 2A\n). From 12 h post MEV infection, the level of viral genomic DNA was significantly down regulated by miR-181b mimics: by 36 h inhibition was almost 3-fold, while the miR-181b inhibitors did not show any effect at earlier timepoints of MEV infection but at 36 h they blocked endogenous miR-181b function and restored the viral growth rate significantly. By 36 h post infection, the level of the genomic DNA had increased 25% as compared with transfection by NC inhibitors (Figure 2B\n). Since all members of the same miRNA family share the same targets [39], we reasoned that the other two members (miR-181c and miR-181d) of the miR-181 family predicted from sequencing data would inhibit MEV replication. Results from virus titration and viral genomic DNA quantification showed that miR-181d mimics, like miR-181b mimics, could inhibit MEV growth, but restoration of the endogenous miR-181d function by miR-181d inhibitors was not detected (Figure S2\nA, B). Surprisingly, miR-181c mimics did not affect MEV replication (Figure S2\nD, E). Since at 36 h post MEV infection the effect of miR-181b was the most apparent, flow cytometry, CPE and MEV indirect immunofluorescence assays were also carried out at that time. Flow cytometry showed that, compared with transfection with NC mimics, miR-181b mimics significantly decreased the proportion of MEV infected cells by almost half (Figure 2C\n). Microscopically, miR-181b mimics significantly reduced MEV-induced CPE in F81 cells in comparison with NC mimics, showing more closely growing, more viable intact and fewer irregular dead cells, while miR-181b inhibitors increased CPE (Figure 2D\n). MEV indirect immunofluorescence assay also showed that miR-181b mimics decreased, and miR-181b inhibitors increased, the quantity of fluorescence (Figure 2E\n). Altogether, these results clearly show that cellular endogenous miR-181b has a negative effect on MEV replication.",

After co-transfection of F81 cells with pGL3-181t and miR-181b mimics or inhibitors, the relative luciferase activity was measured. As predicted, miR-181b significantly inhibited the relative luciferase activity (by more than half) in comparison with NC mimics, while the inhibitors increased it (more than 2-fold) (Figure 3B\n). To provide further evidence that miR-181c did not act like miR-181b, the above experiment was repeated using miR-181c mimics. As previously shown, miR-181c did not affect the relative luciferase activity (Figure 3B\n). To further ascertain the necessary function of complementary seed sequence, a seed reporter vector, mut pGL3-181t, with a mutated tetranucleotide was constructed and the corresponding mut-1 miR-181b mimics and inhibitors were synthesized (Figure 3A\n). After co-transfection of F81 cells, as expected, miR-181b mimics and inhibitors did not affect the relative expression activity of mut pGL3-181t, but mut-1 miR-181b mimics did down regulate it by more than 2-fold (Figure 3C\n). To test whether MEV and the NS1 expression vector pcDNA-NS1 could interact with miR-181b, thereby competing with the reporter vectors, the treated cells were infected with MEV following co-transfection with the luciferase reporter vector and miRNA mimics. In addition, cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector, miRNA mimics and pcDNA-NS1. Results showed that both MEV and pcDNA-NS1 restored the inhibition of the relative expression activity of pGL3-181t vector by miR-181b mimics but did not contribute to the relative expression activity of mut pGL3-181t vector by mut-1 miR-181b mimics (Figure 3D\n). Although the miR-181b target site in the 3\u2032 UTR of the luciferase gene is not representative of its position in the NS1 coding region, these results indicate that cellular miR-181b can directly target MEV NS1 mRNA coding region through a 9 nucleotide complementary seed.",

At 36 h post-transfection, RIPA lysis buffer (HX-BIO) was added and the protein lysates were harvested and subjected to western blot assay. Results showed that miR-181b significantly decreased NS1 protein levels by almost 40%, and miR-181b inhibitors enhanced these by about 20% (Figure 4A\n).

Altogether, these results demonstrate that cellular miR-181b inhibits MEV NS1 expression resulting in translational repression. To further confirm the significance of target sequence in decreased NS1 expression, mut pcDNA3.1-NS1 was constructed.

Flow cytometry showed that miR-181b had no effect on the quantity of the mut MEV infected cells whereas, compared with transfection with NC mimics, mut-2 miR-181b mimics significantly decreased it by almost 2-fold (Figure 5D, E\n). miR-181b did not affect the extent of mut MEV-induced CPE in F81 cells, but mut-2 miR-181b mimics reduced this by comparison with NC mimics, showing more closely growing, more viable intact and fewer irregular dead cells (Figure 5F, G\n). At the same time, MEV indirect immunofluorescence assay also showed that mut-2 miR-181b but not miR-181b mimics decreased the quantity of fluorescence (Figure 5H, I\n). Altogether, these results further establish that the 9 nucleotide target sequence of NS1 mRNA is of great importance for the action of miR-181b on MEV replication.",

Therefore, anti-Ago2 antibody was used to test if miR-181b and NS1 mRNA were enriched by Ago2. As expected, when Ago2 protein was specifically precipitated by anti-Ago2 antibody, no matter whether the cells were untreated or transfected with exogenous miR-181b mimics (Figure 6A\n), miR-181b mimics were enriched almost 15-fold and NS1 mRNA by approximately 2-fold by anti-Ago2 antibody after transfection with miR-181b mimics, as compared with IgG (Figure 6B\n). Endogenous miR-181b was also enriched more than 3-fold and NS1 mRNA by 1.8-fold (Figure 6C\n).

Results showed that miR-181b, miR-181d and miR-301a were significantly decreased by almost 50% after MEV infection, and miR-29b and miR-125b significantly increased by over 30% (Figure 7A\n). Although changes in the expression of most (10 of 14) of the randomly selected miRNAs except miR-99b, miR-26a, miR-21 and miR-29a were consistent with the sequencing data, the magnitude of changes was different for some miRNAs, especially miR-29b. To further confirm that miR-181b was down regulated following MEV infection, the expression of miR-181b was measured at times after MEV infection. It was found that miR-181b gradually decreased with increasing MEV infection time (Figure 7B\n). These observations demonstrate that MEV infection regulates cellular miRNAs including miR-181b.",

In our study, however, the relative luciferase activity of reporter vector pGL3-181t, NS1 protein expression and MEV replication was modulated by miR-181d but not miR-181c (Figure S2). The target prediction results showed that miR-181b and miR-181d had 9 sequential complementary nucleotides, whereas miR-181c had 7 (Figure 1). Although 7 nucleotides have been reported as being sufficient for inhibition of gene expression [61], it appeared that 9 were required in this case. In addition, different base pairing structures between miR-181b and miR-181c in the NS1 target sit might be related to the function of miRNAs [39]. Since miR-181b and miR-181d differ in only one nucleotide, it is possible that they have the same activity. However, following transfection with miR-181d inhibitors, elimination of the inhibitory activity of endogenous miR-181d was not detected (Figure S2\nD, E, F). One possible reason is that the endogenous miR-181d expression level was insufficiently high (<100 copies/cell; i.e., about 10-fold lower than that of miR-181b) to have any function (Figure S1\nA), and therefore miR-181b played the main role in MEV infection.",
