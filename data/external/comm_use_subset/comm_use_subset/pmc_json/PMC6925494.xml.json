            "text": "Following a worldwide pandemic in the year 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused immense economic losses to the global swine industry [1\u20133]. The disease is characterized by acute viral diarrhea in swine and has a mortality rate that is as high as 90% in neonatal piglets [4]. Microscopic examination of PEDV-infected nursing pigs reveals severe necrosis and atrophic villi of the small intestinal enterocytes [5]. Due to the special features of the porcine intestinal mucosal immune system, traditional vaccination methods do not provide effective protection against gastroenteric pathogens. Insufficient immunological protection against PEDV is mainly due to the following: (1) serum antibodies induced by intramuscular immunity that has no effect on intestinal mucosal pathogens; (2) antigens inoculated by oral immunization that are easily degraded in the digestive tract and often only induce low local immune efficiency [6, 7]. Therefore, strategies for improving the function of the intestinal mucosal immune system, including physical barriers, specific sIgA and antiviral cytokines, deserve increased attention for developing PEDV therapeutic targets and prevention.",

            "text": "As a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, interleukin-11 (IL-11) is secreted by a broad range of cell types, including hepatocytes, gastrointestinal epithelial cells, T cells, B cells and macrophages [8, 9]. The binding of IL-11 to its alpha receptor, IL-11R\u03b1 results in a dimeric complex that interacts with GP130 to form a tetrameric complex [10\u201312]. This reaction further activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) [13, 14]. Low levels of IL-11 mRNA are found throughout the body but are rarely detected in tissues of healthy individuals [15]. However, in many inflammatory diseases, IL-11 is readily detectable in tissues and plays an important anti-inflammatory function. Due to its strong ability in promoting proliferation and suppressing apoptosis of enterocytes, IL-11 plays an important protective role against multiple types of IEC damage. Studies have shown that recombinant human IL-11 can reduce the incidence of extensive necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in infants [16]. Further studies reveal that IL-11 can induce an anti-apoptotic effect and the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and protect against intestinal damage caused by neutron and X-ray irradiation injury in mice [17, 18]. Moreover, IL-11 can alleviate intestinal inflammation in mice suffering from inflammatory bowel disease by inhibiting the production of many inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 [19].",

Previous studies have shown that PEDV can induce apoptotic cell death via an AIF-mediated pathway that plays a critical role in promoting PEDV replication and pathogenesis [21, 22].

Based on the IL-11 mRNA level in PEDV infected cells, the quantity of secreted IL-11 in supernatants show a similar increasing trend after viral infection (Figure 1B). However, the kinetics profile of intracellular IL-11 protein detected by Western-blot was different from that of mature IL-11 in supernatants.

Then, the piglets were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg) and sacrificed for macroscopic examination at 60 hpi. The piglets were found to exhibit moderately thin and transparent intestinal walls in the small intestine, with an accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the intestinal lumen (Figure 2A). PEDV mainly colonizes the jejunum and its viral titer is significantly higher than that of the duodenum and ileum (Figure 2B). Histopathological results confirm hyperemia and multifocal diffuse villous atrophy in the jejunum (Figure 2C). Immunohistochemical analysis further shows that a large number of PEDV-positive cells are found in the jejunum of piglets with diarrhea, while PEDV antigens were mainly observed in the cytoplasm of villus epithelial cells (Figure 2C).

Moreover, the Western blotting results further indicate that treatment with S3I-201 significantly interferes with STAT3 phosphorylation and abrogates antiviral activity induced by pIL-11 stimulation (Figure 5D). This effect cannot be due to the cellular cytotoxicity caused by S3I-201, since no changes in cellular viability were observed following treatment with 20 mM S3I-201, as indicated in Additional file 5.

IL-11 stimulation elicits the high expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl-2, MCL-1 and Bcl-W, which are downstream of the IL-11/STAT3 signaling pathway [25]. Pre-stimulation with pIL-11 can reverse the changes in apoptotic related genes, following PEDV infection. Moreover, inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by S3I-201 almost completely abrogates the apoptosis related gene regulation and apoptosis inhibition function by pIL-11 (Figures 6A\u2013C). These phenomena indicate that the anti-apoptosis effect induced by pIL-11 proceeds through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Combined with the results above, the presence of S3I-201 completely abolishes the antiviral activity of pIL-11 against PEDV (Figure 5C). The data presented here indicate that pIL-11 blocks PEDV-induced apoptosis via stimulation of STAT3 signaling, which then inhibits viral replication.",

In the intestinal mucosal immune system, the synergetic feedback loop among cytokines, including IL-22, IL-18 and IFN-\u03b3, consists of a complex mutual regulating cytokine network [31, 32]. These cytokines can provide synergistic innate immunity to curtail viral infections, especially during early life stages, when components of the adaptive immune system are not yet fully operative. Our study is the first to report on the notable and previously unappreciated role of IL-11 in protecting the intestine against viral infection, which broadens our knowledge of the function of IL-11. We hypothesize that pIL-11 may act as an important candidate in these synergistic cytokine networks.

IL-11 induces three major signaling transduction pathways: Jak/STAT, ERK, and PI3K/Akt, of which the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways play an important role in regulating the growth, migration, differentiation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells [33, 34]. However, none of these two signalling pathways participate in the pIL-11-induced antiviral effect observed in the present study. Our study demonstrates that pIL-11 decrease PEDV replication accompanied with phosphorylation of STAT3, while STAT3 inhibitor could significantly reverse the inhibitory effect of pIL-11. These results indicate that pIL-11 activates the IL-11/STAT3 signaling pathway in Vero E6 cells, ultimately improving their antiviral action capacity. STAT3 plays an important role in IL-11 activation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway that regulates the expression of downstream target genes involved in promoting the repair of injured intestinal mucosal cells under pathological conditions [35, 36]. For example, IL-11 upregulates survivin expression in endothelial cells by activating STAT3 and inhibiting apoptosis [37]. Moreover, IL-11 also protects against ischemic intestinal epithelial injury by activating the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, upregulation of Bcl-2, PCNA, as well as the downregulation of Bax [38].",
