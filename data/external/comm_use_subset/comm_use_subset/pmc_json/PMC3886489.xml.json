The causative agent of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) is of particular interest. Its characteristic features are wide geographical distribution and high pathogenicity to humans causing the severe disease with high mortality in the absence of specific immunity in the human population [1\u20133]. There is a constant threat of a pandemic, due to the constant evolution of influenza viruses, the high population density in areas of active circulation of HPAI H5N1, its ability to direct transmission from birds to humans, and the possibility of reassortment with viruses adapted in the human population [4\u20136].",

When studying the distribution of HPAI H5N1 viruses in tissues of internal organs of infected animals in a number of studies, it was shown that they are able to replicate not only in the lung, but also in extrapulmonary organs including liver, kidney, spleen, and brain [9\u201311]. The incubation period typical for HPAI H5N1 is too brief for the occurrence of primary humoral response [12], and the initial period of the disease occurs with the inhibition of the interferon response and reduction of interferon in the blood [10]. At the same time, many researchers have reported significant depletion of lymphoid tissue as a result of massive apoptosis of lymphocytes under the infection [13, 14]. In this connection, a special role acquires nonspecific protection mechanisms of the organism, particularly cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, a significant pool of which is concentrated in the lungs and liver [12]. Macrophages can phagocytize viruses, destroying them [12, 15]; however, in cases of infection with highly pathogenic viruses, including HPAI H5N1, their successful replication occurs in macrophages with the development of cytopathic effect expressed in many organs, which often results in fatal outcome [16].",

The maximum number of cells with signs of A/H5N1 influenza virus replication in mice liver was detected on day 3 of infection. The preferential detection of viral antigen in the sinusoidal cells is probably an evidence of the increasing viremia due to destruction of infected cells and releasing of new virus particles into the blood.",
