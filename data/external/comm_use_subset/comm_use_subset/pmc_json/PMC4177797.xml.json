For both SG and SARS, we made the identification of the order of the parts and autoregressive moving average following the Box\u2013Jenkins approach. First we identified the need for differentiation, for ILI and SARI, the graphical analysis of time-series and autocorrelation functions, as well as for testing the unit root (Dickey\u2013Fuller) who did not reject the hypothesis of non-stationarity for ILI and SARI. In a second moment, it was noted that there was no seasonality for ILI and SARI, by analyzing the periodograms and autocorrelation functions and partial autocorrelation. Subsequently, variable selection models ARIMA (p, d, q) for ILI and SARI followed the approach backward. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) \u2013 which acts to penalize the number of parameters in the model \u2013 and the Schwarz information criterion (SIC) (or Bayesian information criterion, BIC) were also used to select models.",

One possible explanation is that it was demonstrated that for every one degree Celsius rise in temperature, the risk of premature death and acute morbidity especially among respiratory patients is up to six times higher than in the rest of the population. Second, evidence is emerging that increasing temperature is associated with increases in air pollution, especially ground-level ozone, and can amplify the adverse effects of poor air quality.20 Taking this evidence into account, we could expect that higher temperatures may have increased concentration of pollutants, leading to more SARI cases. However, our data showed a decrease in air pollution during the months with a higher prevalence of SARI. The third hypothesis to explain the relationship between higher temperatures and SARI cases was related to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. ENSO undergoes cycles between warm phases (El Ni\u00f1o episodes) and reverse cold phases (La Ni\u00f1a episodes). In the southern region of Brazil, this phenomenon is associated with elevated temperatures and rainfall, especially in spring and in the period between May and July. Previous reports have determined that El Ni\u00f1o events were associated with increased hospitalizations and more severe influenza epidemics.21,22",

In fact, this could be a reflection of higher rainfall in the same period, as rain acts washing out or scattering pollutants from atmosphere.29 On the other hand, we cannot exclude an effect of indoor pollution. In the last years, indoor pollution has been recognized as an emerging health problem, as about 90% of our time is spent indoors where we are exposed to chemical and biological contaminants.30 We estimated indoor pollution indirectly in our study, questioning patients about the use of wood stoves and air conditioning, and the presence of mold in home. Our findings suggested that IFI-positive patients were more prone to live in a residence with mold growth. Dampness and mold are two important sources of indoor pollution, consistently associated with respiratory symptoms. Home dampness may be a marker for mold growth, dust mites, endotoxins, and reduced ventilation, which could increase concentrations of indoor pollutants.31 Cough, wheezing, and upper respiratory symptoms were associated with dampness and mold in a meta-analysis.32 According to these results, the prevalence of cough and wheezing was higher in patients with mold in home and IFI positive.",

Air conditioning use was associated with fewer hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia on days with high concentrations of PM10,33 as individuals are less exposed to outdoor pollutants. Nevertheless, the majority of virus transmission occurs within indoor, air-conditioned (i.e., cooler, lower humidity) environments that favor airborne virus survival and transmission.24,25 In hot and humid conditions, indoor transmission in air conditioning environments may account for most of the transmission.34",

First, it was based on data collected from a single center, which may have potential biases because of the characteristics of the catchment population, like vaccination coverage. Second, it is also important to note that this investigation was performed in a group of hospitalized patients, which is a bias toward the most severe disease cases. Additionally, we do not have the concentrations of individual air pollutants, but it is implausible to reliably separate the effects of air pollutants because they frequently react with each other, sometimes potentiating individual effects.10,35 The short study period should also be considered a limitation. Finally, the use of molecular techniques (PCR) in all study patients could be useful, increasing the number of viruses detected, as limited sensitivity of IFI method is well known.10,36 Despite these limitations, this is the first study, to our knowledge, to analyze the relationship between RV, meteorological parameters, and air pollution in an adult population.",
