In April 2009, an outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was detected in Mexico, with subsequent cases observed in many other countries, including Portugal. It has spread quickly throughout the world and caused at least 15000 deaths in less than a year [1]. Unlike the disease pattern observed during epidemics of seasonal influenza, many of the severe cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection were observed in healthy young people, with approximately 90% of all deaths due to influenza occurring in those younger than 65 years [2]. Most people infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus experienced mild disease, with upper respiratory illness similar to seasonal influenza virus infection. In contrast, gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in patients infected with pandemic influenza virus than in those with seasonal influenza [3]. According to the Portuguese Influenza Surveillance Program (NISP), 64% of the laboratory-confirmed cases for the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were detected in the age group of 5\u201314 years old. A total of 1436 hospitalizations were reported, and the estimated mortality rate was 1.17 per 100000 inhabitants, corresponding to 124 laboratory confirmed influenza deaths [4].",

While some individuals resist infection or recover quickly, others experience severe disease associated with the infection. Intensive research has been performed on the virulence of the virus including its genomic variability but very little is known about the host genetic background influence in the influenza outcome, despite its crucial impact on the immune response and the course of infection [5]. Consequently, in 2009, the World Health Organization identified studies of the host genetic factors\u2019 role on susceptibility to severe influenza as a priority [6].",

The case definition (\u201chospitalization\u201d) used to measure disease severity might not be considered as the best measure in a pandemic scenario given that less severe cases were likely to be hospitalized due to the initial pandemic alert, reducing the effect of IFITM3 rs12252 on the risk of severity (hospitalization). However, we have reduced this bias by excluding patients with disease onset reported in the contention phase when health authorities had the indication to hospitalise all influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases. In addition, the hospitalization criteria that were used in the different health units might not be uniform and could be different from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive and negative cases given the pandemic alert and the indications of the health authorities This differential criterion for hospitalization could explain the presence of the IFITM3 rs12252 association in the negative influenza patients and the absence in the positive influenza patients. The extent of this bias could not be evaluated with the available data. On the other hand, we only performed the confounding adjustment for age and sex variables in the logistic regression analysis, but the reduction of possible confounding bias were also achieved by the exclusion criteria used in the patients selection, excluding patients with known risk factors for influenza infection complication. Regarding the possible selection bias, we were only able to evaluate the representativeness of the influenza hospitalized patients with less 65 years of age without known co morbidities, the patients recorded in the NHD during H1N1 pandemic were not statistical different from the ones included in the study regarding age and sex variables.",

In the future, it will be important to perform an integrative approach to clarify why some healthy individuals resist infection or recover quickly, others experience severe disease associated with the influenza infection. It could be done by considering not only the virus-host genome interactions but also immunity, vaccination, weather conditions and other environmental factors that could help to clarify the present results. Moreover, early screening for the host genetic background could be a promising strategy to identify potential therapeutic targets and might help to evaluate and predict the severity of disease thereby providing critical information for decision making during treatment [21].",
