[2, 12] However, influenza A (H1N1) comprised the majority of global seasonal influenza-related illness again in 2013\u20132014. [13] With this in mind, we performed a systematic review of all studies describing critically ill patients in the 2009\u20132010 Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in order to better understand how patient, temporal, healthcare system and study-specific factors influence reporting of clinical outcomes and to attempt to provide unbiased and valid estimates of mortality. We deliberately did not focus upon all patients with H1N1 as there is no globally valid denominator to describe these patients over different geographic regions. Thus using a standardized definition of critical illness we included such patients across different geographic regions and time periods. Moreover, a focus on critically ill patients is clinically relevant as they are most likely to have poor outcomes and therefore represent an important group to target for early prediction and care.",

To prevent non-independent reporting, we included studies only representing non-overlapping patient populations for the description of outcomes over different geographical or economic regions and specific ICU populations; however we included studies with potentially duplicated patients for description of outcomes over time, and for single versus multiple centers comparisons (Inclusion criteria for subgroups described in S1 File; Fig A in S1 File).",

We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to ensure we adequately recognized and reported the risk of bias. Although we included studies from all regions of the world, the majority of our outcomes were informed by developed regions with capacity to carry out observational and intervention research, and also, the capacity to provide tertiary care for these patients.

These findings have relevance for new and ongoing outbreaks.
