However, in 2012, an emerging genus, Deltacoronavirus, was found in many animal species including swine from Hong Kong [1]. At present, more than five different coronaviruses have been described in swine populations. Among them, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus; meanwhile, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) are assigned to the genus Betacoronavirus  and the genus Deltacoronavirus, respectively [1]. Numerous studies have shown that more than half of porcine coronaviruses (including PDCoV) were enteropathogenic and caused acute diarrhea and vomiting in pigs, which resulted in huge economic losses for the global swine industry [2\u20136].",

As summarized in Table 1, the PDCoV genome was detected in specimens from 4 of 15 swine farms. Interestingly, the PDCoV genome was detected only in nursing piglets, and was absent in suckling piglets and fattening pigs. Although PDCoV was detected in each province/region of southern China, its overall prevalence in the investigated pigs of various age groups (n = 390) was relatively low (5/390, 1.28 %). The positive rate could be higher if only nursing piglets were included (5/150, 3.33 %). In contrast, the prevalence of PEDV, another porcine coronavirus causing epidemic diarrhea, was relatively higher (22.6 %, 88/390). In addition, PEDV was different from PDCoV in that it distributed similarly between nursing (36/150, 24 %) and suckling piglets (47/150, 31.3 %). Five fattening pigs from farms A, D, F and I were also tested positive for the PEDV genome. We also examined whether pigs with diarrhea harbored other enteric viruses such as TGEV and Rota C. Our results showed that the low detection rates (1.54 %, 5/390 for TGEV vs 1.28 %, 6/390 for Rota C) of the two pathogens were present in those pig samples. Intriguingly, co-infection of pigs by PDCoV and PEDV was observed (Table 1). All PDCoV positive nursing piglets were also tested positive for PEDV, thereby indicating a 100 % co-infection rate.",

Sequence alignment results revealed that CH/GD01/2015, CH/GD02/2015, CH/GD03/2015, CH/HN01/2015 and CH/GX01/2015 had >99.9 % homology in the S gene nucleotide sequence, indicating these five viral strains evolved from the same ancestor (Table 2). Further analysis showed that the five viruses reported in this study had the highest nucleotide identity (98.9 to 99.5 %) with a Jiangxi strain (PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015) isolated from Jiangxi province bordering with the northern region of Guangdong province, and possessed the lowest nucleotide similarity (95.4 to 95.9 %) with PDCoV/Swine/Thailand/S5011/2015 and PDCoV/Swine/Thailand/S5015L/2015, isolated from Thailand (Table 2). From the above data, phylogenetic analysis of the S gene showed that the current PDCoVs circulating in southern China were most closely related to other Chinese PDCoV isolates than to those isolated previously from USA, South Korea and Thailand (Fig. 1). In addition, in the S gene, any possible recombinant events were not detected among those PDCoV strains.",

Consistent with the data of S gene, multiple sequence alignment results of N gene showed that CH/GD01/2015, CH/GD02/2015, CH/GD03/2015, CH/HN01/2015 and CH/GX01/2015 had the highest nucleotide homology (99.1 to 99.7 %) with PDCoV/CHJXNI2/2015, and the lowest nucleotide homology (96.9 to 97.1 %) with PDCoV/Swine/Thailand/S5011/2015 and PDCoV/Swine/Thailand/ S5015L/2015 (Table 2). In addition, in the phylogenetic tree based on N gene, PDCoVs were divided into three main branches (Chinese branch, American branch and Thai branch). The five viral isolates reported from this work were clustered together within the Chinese branch (Fig. 2). Moreover, there were no any possible recombinant events occurring at the N gene of those PDCoV strains.",

Then, PDCoV emerged in United States, China, South Korea and Thailand [5, 17, 18]. In most of studies, excluding PEDV, TGEV and porcine rotavirus, PDCoV, as an important enteric pathogen, was detected in clinical samples from pigs with diarrhea [9\u201312, 23]. In addition, it was confirmed experimentally that less than two-week old piglets were susceptible to PDCoV, which caused mild to moderate diarrhea as well as macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines of conventional piglets (5-day-old), and severe diarrhea, vomiting, fecal shedding of virus, and severe atrophic enteritis in gnotobiotic pigs (11- to 14-day-old) [2, 3]. The data further confirmed that PDCoV were enteropathogenic in pigs. Meanwhile, PEDV or rotavirus showed higher detection rates in PDCoV-positive samples compared with other TGEV and rotavirus [8, 13\u201315, 24]. As shown above, co-infection of PDCoV and PEDV occurred in nursing piglets (Table 1), indicating that the diarrhea-related pathogens were quite complex clinically and not easy to control in the field. Moreover, in the two recent studies, PDCoV was shown to have higher infectivity in sows with diarrhea (81.0 %, 34/42) than nonclinical counterparts (23.5 %, 4/17) [8, 15], which might imply that sows often carry PDCoV. And further, it could result in the transmission of PDCoV from sows to the foetus and even newborn piglets, although the pathogenesis mechanism of PDCoV remains unclear.",

[24] study, 2 of 6 samples collected from Anhui Province of China in 2004 were positive for PDCoV, up to now, it was the most ancient time for the detection of PDCoV in China. Meanwhile, PDCoV could date back to August 2013 in United States, where only 3 PDCoV-samples were detected using PCR in archived samples [25]. As for serology of PDCoV, anti-PDCoV IgG antibodies could date back to 2010 using an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on the putative S1 portion of the spike protein [26]. The above studies indicated that PDCoV could have circulated in China at least since 2004 and in United States since 2010. Maybe, due to limted samples in the present study, we did not detect PDCoV in pig samples collected from Guangdong province between 2012 and 2014. Although Asian leopard cat coronavirus (GenBank accession no. EF584908) was close to PDCoV in the phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1 and 2), in the future, more epidemiological surveys should be warranted to uncover the origin of PDCoV.",

Moreover, further sequence alignment showed a 3-nt (TAA) insertion in the S gene and a 3-nt (TTA) insertion in the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of HKU15-44 [1, 5]. During the past 3 years, PDCoV-associated swine enteric disease was paid great attention in the major pig producing countries, especilly United States and China. Up to May 2016, more than 30 complete PDCoV genome sequences were published in the GenBank database. All were generated in China and United States except for one sequence from South Korea and three sequences from Thailand [8\u201319]. The Korean strain, KNU14-04, had 25, 422 nt in length, with similar genome features (a 3-nt insertion in the S gene with 3, 483 nt and a 3-nt insertion in the 3\u2019 UTR, respectively) to all American strains and the Chinese strain (HKU15-44) [9].

In the present study, 3-nt insertion was not found in UTR for our five obtained PDCoV (data not shown). Moreover, two additional unique features including a 6-nt (TTTGAA) deletion in the nonstructural protein (nsp) 2 region and a 9-nt (GCCGGTTGG) deletion in the nsp 3 region were also found in CH/Sichuan/S27/2012 [16].

            "text": "In this study, five S and five N gene sequences, respectively, were obtained to evaluate wherever genetic diversity of PDCoVs existed in southern China. Our results showed that these five S and five N gene sequences were more closely related to Chinese strains, and all clustered together in the phylogenetic tree (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2). However, CH/GD01/2015 and CH/GD02/2015, reported in this study, originated from the same pig farm in Guangdong province, but had 48 nt and 12 nt differences in the S and N genes, respectively. The observed 48 nucleotide changes in the S gene made these viruses differ by 25 amino acid residues (Additional file 2: Table S2). For the N gene, the 12 nucleotide changes among these viruses resulted in 3 amino acid substitutions (Additional file 2: Table S2). Among them, 18 of 25 amino acid differences occurred at the first two-third parts of S gene. Interestingly, in spite of amino acid mutation, both S and N protein retained almost consistent amino acid properties (especially pH value) (Additional file 2: Table S2). Future study will address important roles of these polymorphisms in viral replication and pathogenesis. In addition, they were divided into two distinct small branches (Figs. 1 and 2). These findings suggested that PDCoVs in southern China have diverged from a common ancestor. Despite the emerging genetic diversity, overall, PDCoV prevalence is still largely restricted by the territory as demonstrated in Figs. 1 and 2.",

In this study, there were no any possible recombinant events occurring in PDCoV strains. Maybe, the number and length of our obtained PDCoV sequences were limited. In the following study, the recombination event of PDCoV warrants further attentions.",
