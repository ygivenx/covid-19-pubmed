In adults, HCMV can cause a spectrum of diseases in immune compromised patients involving multiple organs and tissues and is a primary cause of graft loss in transplant patients [1], [2]. In recent years, HCMV has been linked to lung injury in trauma patients [3] and is also postulated to act as a cofactor in atherosclerosis and some cancers [4], [5]. For these reasons, there is an urgent need for an effective vaccine and new antiviral intervention strategies that mitigate the toxicity and drug resistance shortcomings of current antiviral drugs [1], [6].",

More recently Cheng and colleagues [14] proposed additional changes after sequencing isolates to measure genome stability after in vitro and in vivo passage. Also, Lacaze and colleagues [13] extended the microarray approach to include probes specific to both strands of the genome, leading to the discovery of noncoding and bi-directional transcription at late stages of MCMV infection. Finally, a recent transcriptomic analysis of newly synthesized RNA in MCMV infected fibroblasts [15] applied RNA-Seq technology to study regulation of viral gene expression and identified a very early peak of viral gene transcriptional activity at 1\u20132 hours post infection followed by rapid cellular countermeasures but did not attempt to re-annotate MCMV genome.",

Currently, two annotations of MCMV genomes are used \u2013 the original Rawlinson's annotation with minor modifications (GenBank accession no. GU305914.1) where 170 open reading frames (ORFs) are identified and the NCBI reference sequence annotation (GenBank accession no: NC_004065.1) with 160 ORFs. We previously used a transcriptomic approach to analyze gene products of HCMV [16]. This was the first report to characterize abundant antisense and noncoding transcription in the HCMV genome showing that there is greater complexity of herpesvirus genomes than previously appreciated. Using RNA-Seq technology, Gatherer et al.\n[17] showed that most protein coding genes are also transcribed in antisense but are generally expressed at lower levels than their sense counterparts. A more recent analysis of translational products of HCMV [18] by ribosomal footprinting indentified 751 translated ORFs, further underscoring the complexity of herpes virus genomes.",

Here we report that this transcript also specifies a novel protein and to our knowledge, this is the first viral transcript that functions both as a noncoding RNA and mRNA. Analysis of the host transcriptional response to infection revealed many unexpected host genes that are regulated by virus infection, including many noncoding RNA genes. Correspondingly, many host genes regulated by virus infection cluster in unexpected biological pathways that may shed new light on the pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus-associated diseases. Together, these findings suggest important revisions are required for MCMV genome annotation and emphasize numerous aspects of MCMV biology and the host response to this infection that are unknown and require further study.",

We analyzed viral transcripts through classical cDNA cloning and sequencing and through next generation sequencing of cDNA generated from total cellular RNA (RNA-Seq). Analysis of cDNA libraries is a well-proven approach to analyze viral transcripts based on isolation of long transcripts, molecular cloning of the transcripts, and traditional Sanger-based sequencing of the cDNA clones. Traditional cloning has many advantages, including isolation of novel transcripts that may not be identified by probe-based technologies, as well as precise analysis of transcript splice sites and transcript 3\u2032 ends. The introduction of massively parallel sequencing techniques represents a major new technology to study gene expression. Basically, RNA (total or fractionated) is converted to a library of smaller cDNA fragments. Adaptors are added to the fragments, and the shorter fragments are sequenced in a high-throughput manner using next generation sequencing technology. This RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) approach is free of selection biases associated with traditional cloning or probe-based methods and allows for the entire transcriptome to be analyzed in a quantitative manner (reviewed in [21]).",

A summary of the cDNA clones relative to genes annotated in the NCBI reference sequence (NC_004065.1) is shown in Table S1, and a complete list of the 448 cDNA clones isolated in this study and their characteristics are presented in Table S2. A detailed comparison of transcripts cloned in this study compared to current annotations (GU305914.1 and NC_004065) is presented in Table S3, and includes estimated relative expression measured as reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) derived from RNA-Seq analysis.",

To determine if this transcript is translated, an antibody was prepared to the protein sequence predicted for m169. This antibody was used in immunoblot analysis of cell lysates prepared from mock-infected cells and cells infected with wild-type (WT) BAC-derived Smith strain virus, or various multi-gene and single-gene mutant virus strains.

The difference in MAT transcript abundance between WT and the m169-mut virus was lost by 48 hours after infection. However, we observed that MAT protein levels were similar in cells infected with the WT and m169-mut viruses at 24 and 48 hrs after infection (\nFigure 3H\n).

            "text": "In addition to providing valuable insight into transcript structure, RNA-Seq analysis revealed several new facets of the viral transcriptome. First, accumulation of individual viral transcripts varies by several orders of magnitude. \nFigure 4A\n depicts the number of RNA-Seq reads mapped against the MCMV genome in which rows 1, 2 and 3 visualize the data with the maximum number reads set to 50,000, 5000, and 500, respectively. Validating the classical cloning study, the most abundant transcript identified by RNA-Seq is the MAT transcript. Enumeration (RPKM) of the most abundant transcripts is presented in \nFigures 4B and 4C\n, and shows that after the MAT transcript, the most highly expressed genes are m119, M116, and m48, all genes without assigned functions. Also highly expressed are the immune evasion genes m04 and m138, M55 (glycoprotein B), and additional genes of unknown functions (M73 and m15). Second, as shown by comparing \nFigure 4B to C\n, both the overall magnitude of expression and the ranking of the abundance of different transcripts vary according to annotation used for the RPKM analysis. Third, analysis of reads mapped at the highest resolution (\nFigure 4A\n, row 3) indicates that most of the viral genome is transcribed to some degree. Remarkably, 30 or 35% of the reads mapped to intergenic regions, depending on annotation (\nFigure 4D\n). This percentage is reduced to 14% when annotation is modified to reflect the correct MAT gene structure identified in this study. RNA-Seq also detected significant transcription in m74-M75 (Figure S4), M85-M87 and M88-m90 (\nFigure 4E\n) intergenic regions. In contrast, the transcriptional profile of the annotated M87 shows less transcriptional activity than the adjacent intergenic regions. Similarly, RNA-Seq identified transcription from genes that were not isolated in the classical cDNA library or in previous studies using microarray technology [12], [13]. A detailed analysis of the sensitivity of this RNA-Seq study to previous studies is provided in Supplemental Datasets S1A\u2013C. We also compared our RNA-Seq data to a recent RNA-Seq analysis of the MCMV transcriptome using BAC-derived WT virus on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts [15]. As shown in Supplemental Figure S1, the profiles obtained from these two different RNA-Seq experiments are remarkably similar despite using different sequencing platforms and library generation approaches. Also, either seven or eight of the 10 most abundant genes were identical in both datasets (Supplemental Dataset S1C). Minor differences in abundance of some transcripts can be attributed to differences in the time points analyzed in these two studies as well as the fact that our analysis achieved an order of magnitude greater sequencing depth (compare reads analyzed for each histogram set in \nFigure S1).",

In both regions multiple transcripts were detected with different temporal expression patterns. Smaller transcripts tended to accumulate at later time points, a feature previously reported for certain transcripts in both HCMV and MCMV [22]\u2013[24]. In the m15\u2013m16 region 5 transcripts were cloned, all of which overlapped the predicted m15 and m16 genes, and one transcript was spliced (\nFigure 5A\n). The RNA-Seq profile (\nFigure 5A\n, gray histogram) also strongly indicated transcription that spans both predicted genes. Consistent with our cDNA library, no antisense transcripts were detected while the sense probe detected 5 transcripts (\nFigure 5A\n, bands 1\u20135). The 3\u2032 end of all cDNA clones end at or close to nucleotide position 15700 (Supplemental Table S2) and RNA-Seq data alignment to MCMV genome indicates a sudden drop in reads around this nucleotide position. Assuming that transcripts in this region are co-terminal, band sizes predict transcript initiation sites in m11, m12, m13 or m14, and m15 (\nFigure 5A\n, bands 1\u20134). Similar results were found in this region in cells infected with wild isolates of MCMV (Alec Redwood, personal communication). While the smallest band observed by northern analysis (\nFigure 5A\n, band 5) corresponds in size to the novel spliced transcript, E253 (566 bp), we could not confirm splicing by PCR using intron-flanking primers (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely this spliced transcript represents an aberrant transcript or a result of intramolecular template switching during reverse transcription [25].",

This is consistent with our cloning study where 4 transcripts have been isolated in this region and none overlap m19 in the sense orientation (Supplemental Table S2). Evidence from the cDNA library and RNA-Seq alignment (Table S2 and \nFigure 5B\n) indicates that 5 bands detected in northern are co-terminal, with the 3\u2032 end located close to nucleotide position 20430. The largest band at 4 kb (\nFigure 5B\n, band 1) is detectable at 30 and 60 hours PI and we predict that this transcript initiates in M23. We failed to detect transcripts between the m20 and m25 genes consistent with previous studies [12] and northern analyses using mutant viruses lacking genes in this region (data not shown). The lack of cDNA clones can be explained by low abundance and size of this transcript, as well as by propensity of cDNA libraries to enrich 3\u2032 ends. The band slightly smaller than 3 kb (\nFigure 5B\n, band 2) shows a peak accumulation at 60 hours PI and is consistent with a transcript overlapping m19-m21 (approx locations 20430\u201323220, 2.79 kb). The band of approximately 2 kb (\nFigure 5B\n, band 3) shows peak accumulation 10 hours PI. Based on the RNA-Seq profile this band could represent transcripts that initiate at nucleotide position 22060. Finally, the late time points are dominated by smaller transcripts of approximately 1 kb (\nFigure 5B\n, band 5; predicted start site at 21440) which correspond in size to the cDNA clones detected in our study. In short, northern analyses support the conclusion that transcripts overlapping multiple genes in the m15-m16 region and m19-m20 region accumulate in infected cells and indicate that additional, larger transcripts are transcribed in these regions which have yet to be characterized.",

Current annotations predict an ORF of 1.9 kb whereas RNA-Seq profiles and cDNA study both detected a slightly shorter (1.6 kb) transcript with an 81 bp intron. Northern blot analysis (\nFigure 5C\n) identified a strong band of appropriate size (1.6 kb) that starts to accumulate at IE times and peaks at E and L times after infection. Due to the small intron and high abundance of this transcript, unspliced transcripts could not be definitively resolved by northern analysis but were confirmed by PCR using primers flanking the intron (Figure S3). Additionally, northern analysis detected another less abundant band of approximately 3 kb. Leatham and colleagues [26] have detected a band of similar size in the homologous region in HCMV of 3.2 kb that encompasses UL119-115 genes. While we failed to isolate cDNA clones overlapping m117 region, we predict the larger, less abundant 3 kb band observed initiates in m117, though additional northern or 5\u2032RACE studies are needed to confirm the start site of the larger transcript.",

[23] of multiple spliced transcripts that share exon 2. Bands 5\u20137 (\nFigure 5D\n) correspond to previously reported m60, m73 and M73.5 spliced transcripts. In our cloning study four isolated clones correspond to M73.5 transcripts (represented by the longest clone, L443) and one to M73 (L33) (Supplemental Table S4). Transcripts corresponding to m60 were not isolated in the cloning study, however the RNA-Seq profile in the region corresponding to m60 exon1 shows active transcription (Figure S4D). We have also detected a 1.1 kb band (\nFigure 5D\n, band 6) that corresponds to longer M73 and M75 transcripts, and bands corresponding to unspliced transcripts of M73 and M73.5 (approx. 2 kb, \nFigure 5D\n, band 4). In addition to these previously published transcripts, we have also cloned one novel spliced transcript from this region, E180. In accordance with work in the m60 region [23], we propose M71S as a designation for this novel gene. Like other spliced transcripts from this region, E180 shares exon 2 with other transcripts while its splice donor site is located at 102830. The spliced nature of this transcript has been confirmed by PCR (Figure S4C), however more analyses are needed to determine its exact 5\u2032 start site. Northern analysis revealed a band of 0.5 kb (\nFigure 5D\n, band 7) that corresponds in size to the E180 spliced transcript whereas the unspliced version is detected around 3 kb (\nFigure 5D\n, band 3). In addition, a band of similar size (3.5 kb) transcribed from the plus genomic strand detected by the L147 probe (Figure Figure S4B) could correspond to the unspliced version of E180. All probes used in this region detected bands transcribed from negative genomic strand that correspond to those previously reported by Rapp et al. [27]. Based on additional northern blots using cDNA clones L69 (AS to m72) and L147 (AS to m74) (Figure S4A and B) as well as previous reports [23], [27] we conclude that the 5 kb transcript starts in m75 and ends in m72 and corresponds to transcript encoding gH while the 3 kb transcript starts in m74 and ends in m72 and corresponds to transcript encoding dUTPase (Supplemental Figure S4). Additional very large transcripts transcribed from plus or minus genomic strands detected by the L42 and L147 probes, respectively, have yet to be characterized but underscore the complex transcriptional patterns in this region.",

These were also top networks when the subset of up- and down-regulated genes were evaluated (Table S6B). Also identified were networks associated with cell morphology and hematological system development and function. When this analysis was conducted with only induced and repressed genes, the top networks included cellular development, cell-mediated immune response, cellular function and maintenance, gene expression and embryonic development (Table S6C). The relationships among the molecules in top networks for differentially regulated and induced/repressed genes are shown in Figures Figure S6 and Figure S7.

            "text": "There are four major findings from the analysis of the MCMV transcriptome. First, we demonstrate novel transcripts of MCMV including novel splice variants, transcripts that map to noncoding regions, and transcripts overlapping multiple genes. Earlier, we reported similar novel transcripts of HCMV through analysis of a classical cDNA library [16]. This study revealed a dramatic increase in the complexity of viral gene products compared to currently available predictions and its findings were later on confirmed by RNA-Seq analysis [17]. A more recent analysis of HCMV translational products [18] by ribosomal footprinting identified over 700 translated ORFs \u2013 a strikingly high number compared to annotated genes. This discrepancy is, at least in part, a consequence of the polycistronic nature of HCMV transcripts which appear to code for many more ORFs than previously predicted (internal in frame or out-of-frame ORFs, uORFs) as well as ORFs coming from antisense or dedicated short transcripts. Our analysis demonstrated that the MCMV transcriptome is similarly complex: we identified several regions where multiple 3\u2032 co-terminal transcripts expressed in different temporal phases are being transcribed. Such transcripts have the potential to code for truncated protein forms or even completely new proteins as described for HCMV, suggesting that the size and complexity of the MCMV proteome, like the MCMV transcriptome, is currently underestimated. Accumulation of ncRNAs is also a prominent feature of the cytomegalovirus transcriptomes. Our RNA-Seq analysis shows intense transcription in previously described stable MCMV introns and in intergenic regions, consistent with abundant ncRNAs reported for HCMV and MCMV [16], [17], [33]. These findings have a profound implication for understanding studies of CMV genes functions and underscore the need for transcriptomic maps in addition to genomic maps depicting only ORFs. The functions of many MCMV genes have been elucidated by using deletion mutants [34]. However in a transcriptionally complex region of the genome any deletion will likely impact multiple transcripts and possibly multiple proteins resulting in complex phenotypes.",

Interestingly, preliminary estimates in our cloning study indicate that AS transcripts occur at much lower frequency than reported for HCMV [16]. There are likely to be additional AS transcripts of MCMV. Because we did not capture every known sense transcript of MCMV, we may presume that the cDNA cloning study did not capture all AS transcripts. In addition, the RNA-Seq analysis performed in this study was limited by the fact that the methods employed did not provide strand-specific information and could not identify novel AS transcripts. AS transcripts, even those expressed at low levels, may possess noncoding RNA functions and contribute to complexity of the proteome as has described for HCMV [20]. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the number and nature of AS transcripts derived from MCMV and will be critical to generating definitive transcriptome and proteome maps of this virus. The cDNA library analysis does suggest that the extent of MCMV AS transcription is lower than that described for other herpesviruses, including HCMV. These results are consistent with a strand-specific RNA-Seq experiment performed by D\u00f6lken group [15] that also show poor AS transcription in comparison to sense counterparts. Very little antisense transcription was also noted for the anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV1) infecting eels [35], though extensive antisense transcription was reported for other herpesviruses, including KSHV and MHV\u03b368 [36], [37].

The 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of this transcript facilitates degradation of murine miR-27, establishing that this transcript functions as a noncoding RNA molecule [19], [20]. Members of the alpha, beta, and gamma herpes virus subfamilies all encode for abundant, largely enigmatic noncoding RNAs including the latency associated transcript (LAT) of herpes simplex virus (HSV), EBNA RNAs of Esptein-Barr virus (EBV), the \u03b22.7 transcript of HCMV, the PAN RNA of Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) and the HSUR transcripts of herpesvirus Samiri (HVS) which also downregulates the cellular miR27 (reviewed in [39]). In addition to the noncoding function of the MAT, we demonstrate that this transcript also encodes for a novel small protein of approximately 17 kDa.

MCMV encodes virally-derived chemokine homologs specified by the m131/m129 genes [46], [47] and at least one chemokine receptor homolog, M33 [48]. Numerous host chemokine receptors are also upregulated by infection, suggesting a remarkably complex interplay between MCMV-derived and host derived chemokine signaling during infection. Induction of inflammatory gene networks by MCMV also lends credence to the hypothesis that inflammatory responses link CMV infection to chronic diseases, such as chronic allograft rejection, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [2], [4], [5].",

Recently, Insm1 was found to be strongly upregulated by HSV-1 infection and shown to promote HSV gene expression, probably by binding the HSV infected cell protein (ICP)0 promoter. [49]. This raises the intriguing possibility that INSM1 plays a similar role in promoting virus gene expression during MCMV infection. Another induced transcription factor induced at the transcript and protein level is engrailed-2 (EN2). This transcription factor is key to patterning cerebellar foliation during development [50]. We previously described a profound dysregulation of cerebellar development in brains of neonatal mice infected with MCMV [51], suggesting a possible physiological link to regulation of this gene. Another top induced gene was the GABA receptor, Gabrq. Glutamate receptor signaling was also identified as significantly impacted canonical pathways in our dataset. In the developing brain GABA and glutamate receptors influence neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation or survival processes [52]. Whether and how these observations relate to our previous findings that MCMV infection of neonates results in decreased granular neuron proliferation and migration [51] are important areas for future study and may impact our understanding of neurological damage and sequelae associated with HCMV in congenitally-infected infants.",

This is particularly important as herpesviruses can control protein accumulation at the post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels [55]\u2013[57]. We confirmed that the notch ligand, Jagged 2, is highly upregulated by infection at both the transcript and protein level. Notch signaling is a highly conserved signaling pathway that plays important roles in development, including neurogenesis and differentiation of immune cell subsets [58]. Jagged 2 is also upregulated by the alphaherpesviruses, HSV-1 and Psuedorabies viruses [59]. KSHV and EBV also exploit the notch signaling pathway to facilitate aspects of their life cycle [60] and notch signaling is proposed to influence HSV-2-induced interferon responses [61]. We show for the first time that the betaherpesvirus, MCMV, also influences notch signaling. Dysregulation of Jagged2 as a consequence of MCMV infection is highly interesting since it plays a role in important processes affected by CMV including inner ear development [62], [63], generation of motor neurons [64] and differentiation of immune cell subsets [65], [66].",

No drug was used to select for different temporal classes of transcripts and equal amounts of RNA from each time point were pooled prior to library construction. cDNA libraries were generated as described previously for HCMV [16] by following the instruction manual for the SuperScript Plasmid System with Gateway Technology for cDNA Synthesis and Cloning (Invitrogen) with some minor modifications. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). A poly(T)-tailed PacI primer-adapter was used for first-strand cDNA synthesis (5\u2032-GCGGCCGCTTAATTAACC(T)15-3\u2032). After second-strand synthesis, an EcoRI-PmeI adapter was added to the 5\u2032 end and cDNAs were cleaved with EcoRI and PacI.

It is important to note that both ELAND and Bowtie aligners do not map splice junctions and thus give concordant results.

Differential gene expression was assessed by calculating RPKM (reads per kilobase of million mapped reads (RPKM) using SAMMate 2.6.1. release with EdgeR (http://sammate.sourceforge.net/) [73]. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed on filtered lists of differentially expressed genes (p<0.05) using GOrilla ranked lists analysis [31], [32]. Ingenuity Core Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) was used for gene interaction network and canonical pathway analysis. Gene lists were filtered for statistically significant differentially expressed genes (p<0.05) and a fold change cutoff of 2 was set to identify molecules whose expression was significantly differentially regulated. For network generation, these molecules (Network Eligible molecules), were overlaid onto a global molecular network developed from information in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base based on their connectivity. The Functional Analysis of a network identified the biological functions and/or diseases that were most significant to the molecules in the network. Right-tailed Fisher's exact test was used to confirm that biological functions and/or disease assigned to data sets were not due to chance. The nature of individual DE genes was also investigated using the Mouse Genome Informatics databases (http://www.informatics.jax.org/) [74] and Entrez Gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) [75].",

For MAT detection, a DIG labeled double-stranded DNA probe was made using fragments corresponding to the MAT gene sequences derived from cDNA library clones E1, E125 and E134 using Roche's DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit I. For all other northern blots, single-stranded DIG-labeled RNA probes were used generated using Roche's DIG Northern Starter Kit. Antisense probes were generated by in vitro transcription from T7 promoter present in pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing cDNA clones that harbor the desired gene fragments (Table 1). Therefore antisense probes are identical to transcripts cloned in cDNA library and can detect transcripts antisense to cDNA clones. To generate sense probes, T3 promoter was added to 5\u2032 end of complimentary strand of the gene fragments used for antisense probes by PCR (Table 1). The PCR fragments were then in vitro transcribed and DIG labeled using T3 RNA polymerase. Care was taken to generate sense probes of length comparable to corresponding antisense probes.",
