At least three major factors have influenced the increasing incidence of infectious disease epidemics: population concentration at the epicenter of an infection, the underlying characteristics and vulnerabilities of the population at the epicenter [1] and extensive air travel to spread the disease globally [2\u20135]. The most recent is Zika virus (ZIKV), which is an emerging arbovirus in the genus Flavivirus and family of Flaviviridae, related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Zika virus is transmitted among humans primarily by mosquito vectors (Aedes spp., including Ae. aegypti and Ae. Albopictus) [6\u20138] and humans serve as the primary amplification hosts in areas where there are no non-human primates [9]. ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947, and since then outbreaks have been recorded in Africa, Southeast Asia, Pacific with the last one in Brazil in early 2015, which spread to other countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Southern United States [10\u201312]. In all these areas autochthonous and travel associated infection has been reported [6\u20138, 13].",

This is in part due to the relative simplicity of building an isothermal device, but also due to the strand displacement quality of the polymerase so there is no need to denature double stranded DNA prior to amplification. LAMP uses two separate sets of primer pairs that specifically recognize 6 distinct target regions. Addition of a third pair of primers (forward and reverse loop primers) increases the sensitivity and decreases the time required for results [20]. RNA can also be targeted with the addition of reverse transcriptase.",

(Ithaca, NY) is an integrated cassette that can provide both an immunological and nucleic acid (RT-LAMP) result from a single sample. It incorporates all the pumps, valves, micro channels, reactions, and reagent reservoirs on a disposable cartridge described in Chen et al. 2016 [16]. The processing and analysis on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge is controlled by the Encompass Optimum workstation developed to provide automated control of all sample preparation functions as described in Spizz et al. 2012 [28]. Since the current Encompass Optimum workstation does not possess the ability to monitor fluorescence, we employed a novel reverse dot-blot (RDB) hybridization technique to monitor the specific ZIKV amplicons produced in the RT-LAMP assay using hybridization to nucleic acid probes immobilized on integrated DNA arrays [30]. Coupled with the workstation\u2019s image analysis software, qualitative viral loads can be determined. In this approach 50 \u03bcl of sample containing pre-heated lysed ZIKV was added to the sample reservoir on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae [16]. All other steps were automatically performed under software control. The RT-LAMP reaction mix was dispensed automatically into the master mix reservoir onto the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge [16] and pumped with 7 \u03bcl of the spiked sample to the amplification tube where the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out at 65\u00b0C for 30 min. ZIKV RNA was amplified using biotinylated primers. The RDB method employs the same primers used for the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III (Table 1) but the FIP primer is biotinylated. After amplification, the denatured amplicons are hybridized to membrane bound ZIKV capture probes and detected by subsequent addition of streptavidin-conjugated HRP and substrate. Initially four DNA oligo probes were designed to target the ZIKV amplicon from the RT-LAMP reaction (Table 2). These four DNA probes were synthesized and immobilized on an activated membrane as a DNA array [28, 30] at three different concentrations (20, 2 and 0.2 \u03bcM). The microarray key is provided as supporting information (S1 Table). Pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4) was used as a template for RDB assay optimization on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge.",

ZIKV infection had been considered to only be a modest public health concern with only local outbreaks [31, 32]. However reports from the recent outbreak in Brazil and the Americas during 2015\u20132016, indicated that infections during pregnancy are associated with microcephaly and other neurological disorders in newborns and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) in adults pointing to potentially more serious health impacts [33, 34]. On 1 February 2016, the World Health organization (WHO) declared ZIKV and its link to birth defects a public health emergency of international concern and it lasted during 10 months [35]. ZIKV diagnosis is a challenge because it shares vectors, geographic distribution and symptoms with Dengue virus and Chikungunya infection [36] and the three illnesses are often misdiagnosed. Given the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, it is particularly important to distinguish between the 3 viruses. This recent ZIKV outbreak confirm that we need an effective surveillance and diagnostic program to reduce the impact of future emerging infectious diseases. Towards the goal of increasing the speed of making effective diagnostics available, we have developed a generic protocol that can be adapted for the next emerging or remerging disease.",

Drawbacks to saliva as a test matrix are that the concentration is frequently lower than typically found in serum and circadian variations in analyte concentrations can make the sensitivity lower [46].

Estimating the viral load can be useful to investigate correlations of viral load with disease severity and immune responses.

The same limit of detection was obtained for the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III with saliva samples spiked with ZIKV. Ongoing experiments are focused on optimizing the conditions for amplification of ZIKV RNA directly by heat-lysing the virus in the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge and without purification of ZIKV RNA.

The novelty of our developed platform is the use of saliva as the sample matrix and the RDB detection system coupled to the RT-LAMP assay performed in the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridges. In addition, once diagnostic peptides are validated and incorporated into the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridges, we will be able to simultaneously detect ZIKV antibodies and ZIKV RNA. There is currently no combined antibody/nucleic acid test available commercially for ZIKV detection [61, 62].",
