It is transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus. DV causes over 390 million infections every year, and is one of the most important arboviruses causing human diseases\n[1]. The symptoms of DV infection range from mild dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Generally speaking, DF is self-limited, but in a small proportion of people the disease may proceed to severe DHF/DSS. Diverse hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathologic mechanism of DHF/DSS, but the findings remain contradictory.",

Autophagy is characterized by a double-membrane vesicle known as an autophagosome, which recruits cytoplasmic materials and fuses with lysosome for protein degradation\n[2]. Autophagy is classified as macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperon-mediated autophagy, depending on how it delivers the cargo to lysosome and its physiological function\n[3]. Aberrant autophagic activities lead to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, heart disease, and cancers. Tian et al., reported that autophagy was detected in brain sections of a GFP-LC3 transgenic mouse model after transient cerebral ischemia and demonstrated a relationship between autophagy and apoptosis\n[4,5]. Dengue virus infection induces apoptosis in various cell lines and clinical patient specimens\n[6]. However, dengue virus-induced apoptosis and its relationship with autophagy remain to be determined.",

During vesicle elongation, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are activated. First, Atg12 is covalently conjugated with Atg5 by E1-like enzyme Atg7 and E2-like enzyme Atg10. Second, Atg5 binds to Atg16L1, a coiled-coil domain-containing protein, to form a heterotrimeric complex, Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L1. This complex is responsible for the expansion of the phagophore and is dissociated from the membrane when autophagosome formation is completed. Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) (mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8) is initially cleaved by Atg4, a cysteine protease, followed by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) modification on the carboxyl terminus of the cleaved LC3\n[11]. The lipidated LC3 located on the membrane facilitates autophagosome maturation. The autophagosome may fuse with the endosome to form the amphisome or with the lysosome to form the autophagolysosome\n[12-14].",

            "text": "Autophagy is also involved in the host immunity against pathogen infection\n[15]. Autophagy acts as an anti-viral component of the innate immune system and is induced by the ligands of the toll-like receptors\n[16]. Furthermore, autophagy enhances the presentation of viral antigens by dendritic cells during the infection of Sendai and vesicular stomatitis viruses\n[17]. Autophagy can also function in the adaptive immune response by enhancing the presentation of antigen onto MHC class II molecules\n[18-20]. Autophagy not only plays an antiviral role, but also shows pro-viral functions\n[21,22]. Poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3, hepatitis C virus (HCV), coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and DV activate autophagy to elevate viral replication\n[23-28]. HCV uses autophagy for the early protein translation and suppresses the innate antiviral immunity\n[23,29]. The double membrane of the autophagosome may support poliovirus replication\n[30], and the autophagic machinery is utilized for the replication of coronaviruses\n[25,31]. DV infection increases autophagic activity to enhance viral replication, indicating the use of autophagosome as the docking site for viral replication complex or as the organelle for lipid metabolism to provide ATP energy for DV replication\n[25,32-35]. Autophagy induction by NS4A protein of DV prevents the infected cell from death and enhances viral replication\n[35]. While it is known that autophagy plays an important role in DV replication in vitro, the role of autophagy in vivo has not been reported. This study focused on autophagic activity, virus titer and pathogenesis in DV2 infection of the suckling mice.",

In order to establish the role of DV2 infection in the induction of autophagy as well as its roles in DV replication and DV-related pathogenesis in vivo, DV2 or UV-inactivated DV2 (iDV2) (2.5\u00d7105 pfu/mouse) was intracranially injected into six-day-old ICR suckling mice. The body weight, clinical score, and survival rate of the infected mice were measured daily for seven days. The body weight of DV2-infected mice was greatly decreased from day 5 to day 7 post infection (p.i) as compared to the mock-infected and iDV2-infected groups (Figure \n1A). The disease symptoms progressed from mild sickness (losing weight and ruffled hair) at days 2 and 3 to severe paralysis and mortally ill at day 5 p.i., and mice started to die in the DV2-infected group, whereas no deaths were noted in the mock- and iDV2-treated groups at day 6 p.i. (Figure \n1B). The survival rate in the DV2-infected mice was 40% at day 6 p.i and all of the mice died at day 7 p.i., but no mice died in the other two groups (Figure \n1C). To verify that the abovementioned disease symptoms were indeed caused by dengue virus infection, NS1 protein, an indicator of DV infection, was detected by anti-NS1 antibody in the brain tissues, including the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of the infected mice, but no NS1 antigen was seen in the cerebellum and pons (Figure \n1D, arrow). Altogether, DV2 was shown to be capable of infecting the brain tissue of the ICR mice, and of causing severe disease symptoms leading to death.",

In order to establish that autophagy was induced in these DV2-infected mice, aggregation (puncta formation) of endogenous LC3 protein (a marker of autophagy) and DV2 NS1 expression in the brain tissue were assessed. The increased green fluorescent LC3 puncta, representing autophagosome formation, and the increased red fluorescent, representing DV-NS1 expression, were detected in the DV2-infected mice brain as compared to levels found in the mock-infected mice (Figure \n2A, lower panels). Furthermore, colocalization of green LC3 puncta and red DV2-NS1 was seen in the brain sections of the infected mice (Figure \n2A, arrow), suggesting that autophagosome formation was induced and that NS1, as a component of the replication complex working in concert with autophagosomes, may participate in DV replication. The expression levels of DV2 NS1 and LC3 II protein (a marker of autophagosome formation) in the brain were increased only in DV2-infected mice at days 5 and 6 p.i. compared with mock-and iDV2-infected mice. This result further supports the finding showing that DV induces autophagy in vivo (Figure \n2B), and these phenomena were not seen in the heat-inactivated DV2 infection and mock control groups. This finding indicates that autophagy induction requires active DV infection and/or replication. Beclin 1, a coiled-coil protein, interacts with Bcl-2 and plays a critical role during autophagy progression\n[37]. However, in this in vivo study, Beclin 1 expression was not changed either in infected or in mock-infected mice brains by Western blotting at days 3, 5 and 6 p.i. and IHC assay at day 5 p.i. (Additional file\n1: A and B, arrow). In summary, the role of Beclin 1 in DV2-induced autophagy requires further confirmation. The double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles (V) were detected in the brain tissue of DV2-infected mice (Figure \n3C,\n3D and\n3E, arrow), but not in the mock-infected group (Mock) (Figure \n3A and\n3B) under transmission electron microscopy. This double-membrane ultrastructure further supports the result showing that DV induces autophagy in vivo. We further detected the colocalization of green LC3 puncta and red MPR in the brain tissue of DV2-infected mice, indicating fusion of endosome with autophagosome to form amphisome (Figure \n4A, arrow). We also observed the colocalization of DV2 NS1 (red) and MPR (green fluorescence, a marker of endosome) protein in brain sections under fluorescent microscopy, indicating that DV2 existed in the endosome (Figure \n4B, arrow), which is consistent with an in vitro investigation by Panyasrivanit et al. that showed dengue virus was recruited into the endosome, which was then fused with the autophagosome to form amphisomes\n[36]. The data described above demonstrate that DV2 infection in vivo can induce autophagy and amphisome formation.",

To further confirm that DV2 infection indeed induces autophagic progression in vivo, the kinetics of LC3, p62, and NS1 expression level in two representative mice were evaluated at days 3 and day 5 p.i. by Western blotting. When the expression level of LC3II was induced at days 3 and 5 p.i., the expression of p62 was decreased in the DV2-infected group compared to that of the mock-infected group (Figure \n5, 0.59 vs. 0.94 and 0.70 vs. 0.83, respectively). Furthermore, 3-MA was used to block DV2-induced autophagy, and the degradation level of p62 was reversed in the DV2 infection group at days 3 and day 5 p.i. (Figure \n5, 0.73 vs. 0.59 at day 3, and 1.00 vs. 0.7 at day 5). These data indicate that an autophagic flux was induced during DV2 infection in vivo.

The expression of LC3-II protein was suppressed by about 18% at days 3 and 5 p.i. in the 3-MA treated group (DV2+3MA) as compared to that of the DV2-infected group (Figure \n5). The viral titer in the brain of the mice pre-treated with 3-MA was not significantly decreased at days 3 and 5 p.i. (Figure \n6A). However, in the group treated with autophagy inducer rapamycin (DV2+Rapa), the viral titer was significantly elevated as compared to that of the DV infection group at day 5 p.i. (Figure \n6B).

DV2 infection of the brain of 2-day-old Swiss mice induces apoptosis, and dengue virus antigen was detected in the cortical and hippocampal regions\n[39]. Amaral et al. reported that NS3-positive cells could be visualized throughout the parenchyma including the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum in the 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice\n[40]. The discrepancy between our results and those reported in other studies may be attributed to differences in the strain of mouse or virus, age disparity of the mice, and inoculation titer of the viruses. Taken together, the findings described above indicate that dengue virus could infect various regions of the brain and cause disease symptoms. Our findings are consistent with those of previous reports\n[39,40].",

Fusion of autophagosome with endosome to form amphisome was also detected in dengue virus-infected mouse brain (Figure \n4), which was consistent with the result of an in vitro investigation by Panyasrivanit et al. that showed that the endosome harboring dengue viruses fuses with the autophagosome to form amphisome, which serves as the docking site of the viral replication complex\n[36]. Welsch et al. revealed that dengue virus modifies the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane structure to promote its replication and efficient encapsidation of the genome into progeny virus under electron tomography\n[41]. Miller and Krijnse-Locker reported that viral replication complexes form clusters around the double membrane vesicles, which are formed by contiguous invagination of the ER\n[42]. The aforementioned reports indicate that DV may replicate at diverse locations, including the autophagosome membrane. Therefore, autophagy may play a role in enhancing viral replication\n[43]. In this study, we demonstrated the formation of autophagosome and amphisome in vivo during DV infection (Figures \n2,\n3 and\n4). Whether these vesicles are also involved in DV replication requires further confirmation.",

An accumulation of autophagosomes (measured by TEM, as fluorescent GFP-LC3 dots, or as LC3II lipidation on a Western blot), could reflect either increased autophagosome formation due to increases in autophagic activity, or to reduced turnover of autophagosomes. The latter can occur with the inhibition of their maturation to amphisomes or autolysosomes, which happens if there are defects in the fusion with endosomes or lysosomes, respectively, or following inefficient degradation of the cargo once fusion has occurred\n[44]. In our study, we demonstrated that the fusion of autophagosome and endosome occurred to form amphisome in vivo during DV infection together with p62 degradation, indicating that DV2 infection induces the autophagy flux in vivo (Figures \n4 and\n5).

This result is consistent with the finding of our previous in vitro study\n[25]. Nevertheless, whether Beclin 1 participates in DV-mediated autophagy needs further investigation. We further demonstrated that manipulation of autophagy affects DV2 infection-related pathogenesis, including disease symptoms, survival rate, and virus titer by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, which suppresses the PI3K class III signaling pathway and autophagic activity, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin, which blocks the mTOR signaling pathway. Although encephalitis and neuronal involvement in dengue virus infection are rare, this suckling mice model provides a unique system to clarify dengue-mediated autophagy in vivo. While the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA suppressed LC3II expression, it could not significantly suppress virus titer at days 3 and day 5 p.i. in vivo (Figures \n5 and\n6A). It is known that 3-MA plays dual roles in autophagy\n[49]. Under starvation conditions, 3-MA suppresses PI3K class III and inhibits autophagy; however, under normal conditions, 3-MA promotes autophagic flux. Therefore, the treatment conditions of 3-MA needed to be further optimized to increase its inhibitory effect on autophagy. In summary, manipulation of autophagy by 3-MA and rapamycin affects clinical scores, survival rate, as well as DV2 titer in vivo. A recent report demonstrated that DV-NS4A expression induces autophagosome formation during dengue virus infection, and promotes the infected cells to avoid apoptotic cell death, which thus contributes to viral replication\n[35]. Therefore, whether suppression of DV-mediated autophagy by 3-MA induces infection-mediated apoptosis and further reduces the replication of dengue virus requires further confirmation.",
