In 1905, Zammit, a Maltese bacteriologist, showed that infected goats transmitted brucellosis and that banning the use of their milk would be effective in eliminating the disease. The observation that apparently healthy goats could be carriers of the disease has been termed one of the greatest advances ever made in the study of epidemiology [2].",

It also causes large disease in animals and people and lacks effective control [1, 4\u20136]. Accurate epidemiological data are not available for many endemic areas, but it has been estimated that more than 500,000 new human cases occur annually [7].",

The study led to description of two novel species: Brucella ceti and Brucella pinnipedialis. At position 52, Scholz et al. in 2008 described two strains of Brucella microti as novel species.

Both patients were young men from Peru and the route of infection was not discovered [25].

They also showed that the system is essential for the intracellular growth during infection [32]. The system is one of few classical virulence factors identified to date [33]. The type IV secretion system is a pumping system that selectively transports proteins or other macromolecules through membranes [34]. After Brucella is taken up by vesicles in macrophage, acidification is thought to induce VirB expression. The VirB system interacts with components of the endoplasmic reticulum, neutralising the pH and allowing the Brucella to undergo regulated cell division [34]. Other classics that further explored this system include Celli et al. in 2003 (position 16), Comerci et al. in 2001 (position 31), Boschiroli et al. in 2002 (position 34), Sieira et al. in 2000 (position 40), Kohler et al. in 2002 (position 47), and Hong et al. in 2000 (position 50). In addition, Sola-Landa A et al. in 1998 (position 45) identified the BvrR/BvrS system for the first time in B. abortus (Bvr: Brucella virulence related; R: regulatory; S: sensory). At present, the BvrR/BvrS system is one of the best characterized two component systems. Two component systems allow the bacteria to sense their environment and subsequently modulate the expression of genes [35].",

Am J Public Health Nations Health, 1939); (c) identifying Brucella outbreaks could be difficult: Brucella is difficult to detect and identify [38]; and (d) Brucella species are genetically homogeneous, and thus, the typing of Brucella species for epidemiological purposes by conventional molecular typing methods has remained elusive [39].",

For example, in the WOS, in the categories of \u201cagriculture, dairy, and animal sciences\u201d and \u201cfood science and technology,\u201d the highest impact factor for a journal was 4.7 and 7.3, respectively. While in the category of \u201cmedicine, general and internal\u201d and \u201cmicrobiology,\u201d the highest impact factor for a journal was 72 and 23.6, respectively. (b) The possible low productivity of research that is performed on Brucella as evidenced by the lower number of articles on Brucella in agricultural journals. For example, a combined search for the word \u201cbrucell\u2217\u201d and the journals \u201cVeterinary Research\u201d and \u201cJournal of Dairy Science\u201d yielded 20 and 25 papers, respectively, while the same search in the journals \u201cClinical Infectious Diseases\u201d and \u201cJournal of Bacteriology\u201d yielded 52 and 237 papers, respectively. Furthermore, we doubt that our search missed important journals from the agricultural fields because the databases Scopus and WOS include large collection of agricultural journals. Scopus has 2608 journals included under the \u201cagricultural and biological sciences\u201d subject area and WOS has 58 journals included under the category \u201cagriculture, dairy, and animal sciences\u201d and 130 journals under the category \u201cfood science and technology.\u201d",

Here, we ranked the articles according to the highest obtained citation count from any of the two databases. We believe that our method is more accurate because relying on the mean for ranking might lower the rank of a given article. This is because the databases differ in reporting the citation count for a particular article. The variation in citation count between databases results from differences in journal coverage and quality [44]. Scopus includes a more expanded spectrum of journals than WOS, and its citation analysis is faster and includes more articles than the citation analysis of WOS [45]. However, Scopus tends to miss older citations which results in omission of studies before 1980 [46, 47]. Here, we identified 12 articles that were listed in the highest 50 articles in one database but were not identified within the highest 50 articles in the other database and vice versa. Articles that were identified by WOS and not by Scopus tended to be older and of basic science type, while articles identified by Scopus and not by WOS were more recent and mostly of observational and review type.",

These limitations include the presence of inherent problems in the citation process itself, for example, incomplete or inappropriate citations, biased citation [44, 45, 52, 53]; changes in the list of citation classics with time making it a snapshot of the current state of research [54]; absence of articles with languages other than English which is mostly because authors are more likely to cite articles in their own language, and English articles are more likely to be cited overall [20]; and finally, missing of important studies because their findings became well known [55]. The latter point is relevant here because brucellosis was discovered in 1887 and it is possible that some important studies were not indexed in current database but their findings are now considered well known. Despite these limitations, the study provides a picture for the main cited articles in brucellosis research publications since the discovery of Brucella 130 years ago.",
