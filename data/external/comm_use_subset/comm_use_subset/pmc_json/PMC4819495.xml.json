            "text": "There has been growing interest in recent years of the effects of macrocontext (national or international conditions or events) on individual factors in psychology (Fletcher, 2015). However, the idea that dramatic changes in the global environment can have meaningful influence on individual psychology is not a new one. C. Wright Mills (1959/2000, p.3) laid the groundwork for this area of inquiry, stating \u201cneither the life of an individual nor the history of a society can be understood without understanding both\u201d. In a pioneering study, Glen Elder\u2019s (1999) research on children growing up in the Great Depression prompted consideration of not only the influence of macrolevel conditions on progress and frustration in development, but also how such effects filter through to young people via links with local institutions, social ties, and family networks. Elder (1999) noted effects of the Great Depression on social wellbeing, psychological health, and hope and optimism for the future; particularly among those who were younger and thus less cognitively developed. In addition, Elder drew attention to the effect of economic downturns on populations of youth as a whole, in addition to those suffering abject and persistent deprivation (see Elder & Caspi, 1988). Thus, one needs to consider the effects of economic downturns on factors such as wellbeing across whole cohorts (Jahoda, 1988).",

Indeed, Di Tella et al. indicated that rising unemployment that results from economic hardship has a critical effect not only on those who lose their job, but for the population as a whole. These effects were observed across a range of macroeconomic events including recessions, changes in GDP, inflation, and the relative generosity of the welfare system. Schoon (2006) considered cohorts of British people born in 1958, thus growing up in a golden age of economic stability and prosperity, and those born in 1970, thus growing up in more economic vulnerable times. Schoon reported that growing up in times of economic prosperity seems to be a protective factor against psychological distress and promotes wellbeing. Conger, Rueter, and Conger (2000), studying the effects of the severe economic downturn in the rural midwest of the United States found that economic distress affected young people\u2019s wellbeing via its impact upon parents\u2019 mood and parenting behavior. Finally, Forkel and Silbereisen (2001) considered the effect of the reunification of Germany on development. Using a family stress model framework, they found that economic uncertainty had an effect on child wellbeing via parents depressed mood in the West, but less so in the more significantly altered society in the East.",

They also found significant increases in depression and anxiety. Likewise the recent UNICEF Innocenti report (Fanjul, 2014) found that in 29 of the 41 OECD and non-OECD EU countries wellbeing decreased and experience of everyday stress increased from 2007 to 2013. They attributed this impact as likely due to the GFC.",

Steinberg noted that this malleability means that young people are particularly vulnerable to toxic contexts that can lead to lifelong negative impacts. Cummins (2014) likewise noted that wellbeing is particularly volatile during adolescence due to heightened biosocial change. This is consistent with the work of Elder (1999) who noted that age was negatively related with impact of the Great Depression, hypothesizing that ongoing cognitive development meant that hardship had a more severe and long lasting impact.",

The life span theory of control indicates that those making the transition from formal schooling to tertiary education or the labor market are particularly at risk of contextual events and influences (Heckhausen, Wrosch, & Schulz, 2010; Heckhausen & Schulz, 1995; see also Dietrich, Parker, & Salmela-Aro, 2012). Such a period is defined by the convergence of developmental tasks from multiple life domains (educational, occupational, social, family, romantic, and values) and, as such, is one of the most critical developmental periods (Zarrett & Eccles, 2006). From the perspective of life span theory of control (Heckhausen & Schulz, 1995) the particular danger of macroeconomic events, like the GFC, would be the potential to knock youth off a typical developmental track; delaying transitions, interfering with increasing independence from parents, and extending periods of career and educational uncertainty. For example, research on transition delays provides evidence that even a relatively short delay can have ongoing consequences for status attainment well into adulthood (see Haase, Heckhausen, & K\u00f6ller, 2008; Heckhausen & Tomasik, 2002; Parker et al., 2015).",

As noted above, both unemployment and the risk of unemployment has a particularly detrimental effect on wellbeing (Clark, Georgellis, & Sanfey, 2001). The risk of unemployment can cause young people to make different choices about their educational and occupational plans than they otherwise would, which can put them at a distinct disadvantage when competing with their near age peers who entered this developmental period at a more economically advantageous time (see Kahn, 2010). Finally, at the post-high-school transition young people are increasing independence via entry into the labor market or tertiary education, yet they also remain strongly connected to parents (Parker, L\u00fcdtke et al., 2012). As such, the wellbeing of young people may suffer from both their own exposure to economic downturns but also that of their parents as suggested from a family stress model perspective (Conger et al., 2000).",

This literature, however, has tended to use cross-sectional studies without the ability to follow individuals over time. Here we make use of the unique opportunities afforded by the LSAY datasets, which follow young people from four birth cohorts for up to 10 years. The nature of the LSAY data, four birth cohorts measured roughly three years apart, allows us to compare the influence of the GFC at two distinct ages in the post high-school transition period (i.e., age 19 and 22). As can be seen in Table 1, the 19-year-old age group captures much of the movement of young people from high-school to tertiary education or the labor market. At age 22, young people appear to have mostly made this transition. The comparison of these age groups is opportunistic (i.e., due to the possibilities afforded by the data), however, and thus we have little evidence on which to assume the GFC would have differential effects. On this basis, we put forward the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1: The GFC will have a negative impact upon young people\u2019s wellbeing across the major domains of importance to late adolescents.\nHypothesis 2: We expect the influence of the GFC to differ by life domain, with particular impact on domains related to social life and long-term prospects.\nHypothesis 3: As existing research base is not yet large enough on which to make a strong hypothesis, we do not anticipate that there will be differences in the size of the effect of the GFC at age 19 compared to 22.",

The 1981 and 1984 cohorts reflect representative samples of Australian year nine students with wellbeing data collected 2 years later. The 1987 and 1990 cohorts represent longitudinal extensions of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a representative sample of 15-year-olds where wellbeing data was collected a year later. Harmonization was based on modal grade in school rather than age in years. As a result there is a difference of several months in the average age of the cohorts for the waves of interest with the average age gradually increasing from 1981 to 1990 cohorts. This may be due in part to differences in how data was collected, but may also reflect a growing preference for later school intake ages by parents (see Edwards, Taylor, & Fiorini, 2011).

Two additional domains relating to the economy and the way in which the country is being run were excluded due to not being present at critical waves of the study. All variables begin with the stem \u201cHow happy are you with [DOMAIN]\u201d (see below for suffixes), with response scales varying from 1 (very happy) to 4 (very unhappy). To aid interpretation, these answer points were reverse scored such that higher scores reflected greater happiness. An additional response point was included representing \u201ccan\u2019t say/don\u2019t know.\u201d This choice was selected by less than 1% of the sample on average and never more than 4% for any question in any wave.

Such a result is important, as the GFC had a much milder influence in Australia than it did elsewhere. Indeed, although youth unemployment jumped from 8.9% to 13.8% during the GFC in Australia, it rose from under 10% to almost 18% in the United States (our calculation) during the same period. Thus, although research in other countries is needed, it is likely that the results in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, let alone Greece, Italy, Ireland, and Spain, was considerable. Importantly, given our focus on the population as a whole, unmoderated by individual exposure, the effect sizes of above .10 standard deviation units, and often above .15, were concerning given effects of unemployment of .50 (Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, & Diener, 2004). This suggests that for particularly vulnerable groups, for example those who experienced the largest relative loss in status or income or became unemployed, the findings may have been considerably more dramatic.",

Although we did not provide a hypothesis for this pattern, exploration of the unemployment rates provides a potential explanation (Di Tella et al. (2006). In particular the pattern of decline and recovery is consistent across both wellbeing and unemployment. Namely, unemployment rose sharply from 2008 to 2009 before recovering just as rapidly. From 2011 unemployment then increased steadily to levels worse than those at the initial impact of the GFC (see Figure 4).

This difference, however, was only consistently significant in three cases; social life, independence, and living standards. These particular domains may be associated with the many upheavals that occur during the post high-school transition (see Dietrich et al., 2012). As can be inferred from Table 1, the GFC hit 19-year-olds at the end of high-school and in a period where most of the sample was establishing themselves in either university or the labor market. Restructuring of old relationships and forming of new friendship circles after high-school is common during this period (see Tanner, 2006), which may explain why satisfaction with social life was affected more for 19-year-olds. Likewise, during this transition young people are expected to considerably increase their independence from parents (Parker, L\u00fcdtke et al., 2012). Although not the focus of this study, it may be that the GFC meant that 19-year-olds had less financial independence and were thus less able to establish greater independence either within the family home or by moving out. The older 22-year-olds transitioned from high-school some 3 years earlier and were thus able to at least begin the developmental tasks associated with restructure old and establish new relationships and gaining independence from parents during a more prosperous period.",

They do note, however, such a payment may not be sufficient for dramatic changes to economic conditions. The Australian context provides a means of exploring this hypothesis given that the government provided payments of up to $900 AUD ($597 U.S. in 2009 dollars) to 80% of the working age population and 90% of families (Hyslop, 2014). Although not the main focus of the current research, satisfaction with money was the one domain to be largely unaffected by the GFC, suggesting a positive effect of the payment may have occurred.

This was difficult in the current case, however, where we had no data on individual exposure to the GFC, which would likely be the strongest moderator of any GFC effect (e.g., Sargent-Cox et al., 2011). Importantly, although we used rigorous designs by borrowing from the logic of DID and PSM regression in our research, the extent to which they represent causal effects is dependent on the degree to which the comparison cohorts represent true counterfactual counterparts to the GFC exposed cohorts. As we noted above we make the assumption that cohort effects are negligible. Although we aimed to design our models as close to ceteris paribus comparisons as possible, readers should consider the potential biasing effect of birth cohort differences. Finally, it should be noted that we used single-item measures for wellbeing in each life domain.

We found that all domains were significantly affected in at least one case, with effect sizes often above .10 for those who were aged 19 during the GFC. Given that we were focused on a country in which the impact of the GFC was less sever than in the European Union or the United States, these effects are of international concern. As Conger et al.
