            "text": "HAdV-B14p was first isolated from The Netherlands and linked to a respiratory tract disease outbreak in military recruits between April and May, 1955[4]. This particular virus was associated with sporadic cases of acute respiratory disease (ARD) in Europe and Asia through the 1960s [4], [5] and then was not reported for a long period. In the approximately 50-year interval from the original identification to the recent outbreaks, reports of respiratory disease associated with HAdV-B14p were rare and limited to small numbers of patients [6]. Recently, from 2005 through 2009, HAdV14p1 has apparently re-emerged and has been associated with several large ARD outbreaks across the USA, associated with nine military and twenty-four civilian communities in contrast to the past, as well as in Europe (Ireland) [6]\u2013[8]. Several HAdV-B14-like infections have also been recently reported in China, beginning from 2010 [9], [10]. The applications of genomics and bioinformatics to the adenoviral genomes provide high resolution insights into their epidemiology and evolution, specifically revealing the molecular basis for the genesis of several emergent and re-emergent adenovirus pathogens [2], [11]\u2013[20]. This report presents the isolation and identification of a type 14 adenovirus, isolated from a six-month-old baby diagnosed with bronchial pneumonia. It was confirmed as HAdV-B14p1 by the analysis of its genome and, in particular, the hexon, fiber, and E1A genes. The genome was sequenced, analyzed, and compared with other reference adenovirus genome sequences archived in GenBank. This analysis shows that the Beijing HAdV14p1 has a close phylogenetic relationship with HAdV-B14p, isolated in 1955 from The Netherlands. Its sequence is remarkably conserved, given the time and geographic distances. It is also nearly identical to a HAdV-B14p1 strain (303600) recently characterized from an outbreak in the USA (2006). Given the recent outbreaks of this particular virus in the USA, Europe and China, these genome data and this report provide a reference for recognizing any future HAdV-B14 outbreak in China and serves as a foundation for the development of adenovirus vaccines and surveillance protocols in high-risk areas. Further, these observations will aid the continuing research and development of adenovirus-based vectors.",

Improved detection, identification, and high resolution analysis of the genomes of these highly contagious emergent and re-emergent pathogens will enable a better understanding of this virus, and will provide a basis for enacting measures to prevent or limit its effect on the population. Here we report the details of the analysis of a HAdV-B14p1 genome recovered from a respiratory infection in a six-month-old baby from Beijing.

Sequence analysis shows a small number of genome changes between the recent China and USA strains of HAdV-B14p1, with nearly identical differences in both that are divergent from the genome sequenced from the prototype virus isolated in The Netherlands in 1955. These differences include a two amino acid deletion in the fiber gene, which suggests a shared lineage of these two HAdV-B11p1 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the three genes support the partition of HAdVs into species, originally based on biological, epidemiological, and structural attributes. Of particular note are the subclades of subspecies B1 and B2, which are closely related viruses. Of these, HAdV-B14 and -B55 are recent re-emergent respiratory pathogens; HAdV-B3, -B7, and -B16 are long-standing respiratory pathogens. As HAdV-B55 is a recombinant, involving a renal pathogen and a respiratory pathogen, and as HAdVs from species D HAdVs comprise prototypes of recombinogenic origins[26], clinicians and epidemiologists should factor this into surveillance and diagnostic protocols.",

New strains of HAdVs are problematic if there is no herd immunity present to counter that specific virus. Of additional concern is whether it may recombine with another HAdV to evolve into a more deadly or more contagious pathogen. An example of this is HAdV-B55, which has emerged and has been reported in China recently. The isolate QS-DLL was originally reported as \u201cHAdV-B11a\u201d, based on its hexon and fiber genes, but is recognized as a new genome type HAdV-B55 due to its whole genome identity to HAdV-B14 as well as its pathogenecity profile as a respiratory rather than a renal tract pathogen. HAdV-B55 is a recombinant adenovirus comprising a large portion of the HAdV-B14 genome and a much smaller portion of the HAdV-B11 genome. It is also an emergent pathogen in China as HAdV-B55 was identified as the virus responsible for a large respiratory disease outbreak in 2006, which included one fatality, and has been found subsequently to cause respiratory disease outbreaks in several provinces. It is a serious public health issue in both military and civilian populations nationally in China (unpublished). HAdV-B14p1 is not a recombinant genome as its genome is nearly identical to that of the prototype, which was examined for recombination events [28]. This recombinant analysis was repeated and confirmed for this study, given the influx of additional genomes into GenBank. The phylogenetic survey and protein percent identity analysis support this view as well. This particular type 14 genome data will enable the identification and further understanding of any future emergent recombinant HAdV resulting from adenovirus type 14.",
