In the rat liver there are two allelic variants of CEACAM1 which differ by 16 amino acids in their N-terminal domains [2], [4] and two major splice variants, designated 4L and 4S, that are distinguished by differences in the length of their cytoplasmic tails of 70\u201372 amino acids and 10\u201312 amino acids, respectively [2], [4], [5].",

However when expressed in MCF7 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, CEACAM1-4S induced glandular morphogenesis, an activity requiring phosphorylation at one or more sites in the 4S cytoplasmic domain [19], [20], [21]. Site directed mutagenesis further showed that mutation of phenylalanine 445 at the C-terminus of the CEACAM1-4S cytoplasmic domain not only compromised interactions with the actin cytoskeleton but also inhibited lumen formation, suggesting interactions of CEACAM1-4S with the cytoskeleton were an important determinant of glandular morphogenesis. Interestingly, when mouse mammary carcinoma cells were grown in humanized NOD/SCID mouse mammary fat pads, only the 4L isoform initiated morphogenesis, the opposite of what was observed in vitro\n[21], raising questions about the equivalence of in vitro and in vivo models of morphogenesis.",

            "text": "Because of its role in cell adhesion, the CEACAM1 N-terminal Ig domain [22], [23], [24], like the cytoplasmic domain, has been the focus of numerous investigations. The adhesive epitope within the N-terminal Ig-domain has been defined for rat [24], mouse and human CEACAM1 [22], [23], the evolutionary relationships between CEACAM1 from different species has been determined [25], [26] and the three dimensional structure has been established by X-ray crystallography [27]. In comparison, the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain has received relatively little attention, perhaps because transmembrane domains have often been viewed as passive anchor sequences that span the lipid bilayer. Over the last 10 years, this simplistic viewpoint has fallen by the wayside in the face of accumulating evidence implicating transmembrane domains in helix-helix interactions leading to dimerization, oligomerization and signal transduction [28], [29], [30]. The possible involvement of transmembrane-transmembrane domain interactions in the functionality of CEACAM1 was suggested by the presence of repeating GXXXG motifs (where X represents any amino acid), sequences known to control protein dimerization and signaling [30], [31], and the presence of transmembrane C-terminal tyrosine residues shown in other proteins to be mediators of molecular recognition, self assembly and signal transduction [32]. In the present investigation, we have examined the effect of transmembrane domain mutations on the ability of CEACAM1-4S to confer an anchorage independent phenotype when expressed in a clonal line of CEACAM1 negative, anchorage dependent rat hepatocellular carcinoma cells, designated 253-NT. Our results show that transmembrane mutations in both GXXXG and tyrosine residues have both positive and negative effects on the anchorage independent phenotype produced by wild type CEACAM1-4S.",

            "text": "Mutation sites were chosen based on the consensus location of the transmembrane domain predicted by the different membrane topology algorithms shown in Table 1. The results from this analysis showed that the various transmembrane prediction algorithms delineated transmembrane domains with variable N (G424 to I431) and C (Y445 to S449) termini and different numbers of potential GXXXG motifs. All of the predicted transmembrane domains lacked the terminal GLSE predicted by Kyte Doolittle and Hopp-Wood (Table 1) and thus did not include the G420-LSE-G424 motif. Ten of the 12 predicted transmembrane domains included G428, strongly suggesting the presence of the two motifs centered on G432 (G428-IVI-G432 and G432-SVA-G436). Although G424 was present in only 3 of 12 predicted TM, G424's location at the N-terminus of a tandem array of three classic GXXXG motifs caused us to consider that the G424-AIA-G432 sequence might function as a dimerization motif when all the other GXXXG motifs were disrupted by G428L and G436L mutations. With regard to the C terminus, all of the predicted transmembrane domains contained Y445 and 7 of 12 contained Y448, leading us to conclude with reasonable certainty that Y448 was within the transmembrane domain or at the very least, at the interface between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Taking all of these considerations into account, we arrived at the transmembrane sequence proposed in Table 2. The brackets denote the uncertainty with regard to G424 and Y448. In recognition of the variability in the predicted N-terminus and the uncertainty regarding the functionality of the G424-AIA-G428 motif, we introduced a G424L mutation to disrupt this motif and a G432L mutation to knock out both the G428-IVI-G432 and the G432-SVA-G436 motifs. Disruption of all three of the possible GXXXG motifs was accomplished by introducing both G424L and G432L mutations. To disrupt tyrosine mediated interactions, Y445 and Y448 were replaced with V, the choice of a tyrosine to valine mutation being based on the following considerations: 1) valine lacks a hydroxy group; 2) valine does not have an aromatic side chain; 3) valine is non-polar and thus should not disrupt the alpha helix or alter transport to the plasma membrane.",

The primary goal in these studies was to gain insight into the role of the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains in cell adhesion and tumor suppression. In the present report, we have focused on the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain, a relatively uncharacterized region shared by both the 4L and 4S isoforms. Our cell model for these studies was an anchorage dependent, CEACAM1 negative subclone designated 253-NT that was derived clonally from the parental rat 253T cell line [6]. When suspended in soft agar, 253T cells continued to grow and by three weeks had formed well-defined anchorage independent colonies (Figure 1A). In comparison, soft agar cultures of 253-NT cells showed no evidence of significant growth and after three weeks were composed almost entirely of single cells (Figure 1B). In contrast, 253-NT cells stably transfected with a wild type CEACAM1-4S expression plasmid and enriched by FACS to yield cultures at least 70% positive for CEACAM1-4S expression regained the anchorage independent phenotype of the parental 253T cells (Figure 1C) while cells stably transfected with empty vector (Figure 1D) had not grown significantly after 3 weeks in soft agar.",

To determine if these transmembrane domain elements played a part in the anchorage independent phenotype induced by CEACAM1-4S, nine expression vectors encoding CEACAM1-4S with transmembrane domain mutations in the GXXXG motifs and/or tyrosine residues were constructed as described under Methods and shown in Table 1. These vectors were used to produce stably transfected sublines of 253-NT. Single G424L or G432L mutations or double G424L/G432L mutations were introduced to disrupt two or more GXXXG motifs. Substituting leucine for glycine introduced a large hydrophobic amino acid that maintained the hydrophobic character of the transmembrane domain but disrupted the conformation of the transmembrane domain helix [28]. Transmembrane domain tyrosine residues were mutated to valine, a substitution that replaced tyrosine with a non-polar hydrophobic amino acid lacking a hydroxyl group in its side chain. In other systems, proper spacing of the tyrosine hydroxyl group had been shown to be necessary for signaling events dependent upon protein-protein interactions [41].",

In contrast, 253T-NT cells expressing CEACAM1-4S with GXXXG motifs disrupted by G to L mutations (Figure 5A, B, C and Figure 6) either did not grow or formed colonies that for the double glycine mutant (Figure 5C and 6), were less than half the size of those formed by cells expressing the wild type protein (Figure 1C and Figure 6). Moreover, the rapid growth phenotype conferred by tyrosine to valine mutants appeared to be dominant over the growth suppressed phenotype displayed by glycine to leucine mutants since all of the sublines with both glycine to leucine and tyrosine to valine mutations displayed enhanced anchorage independent growth (Figure 5G, H, I and Figure 6).",

Subcutaneous tumors were harvested from animals at three weeks after injection, a time point chosen by necessity because of the large tumor burden in animals injected with 253T-NT cells expressing tyrosine mutants. On average, tumors produced by cells expressing wild type CEACAM1-4S were 5.5- and 6.5-fold larger by weight than those generated by cells transfected, respectively, with the empty vector or the single G424L mutant (Figure 8). While cells expressing the wild type protein formed tumors comparable in weight to those formed by cells expressing the double G to L mutant, 253T-NT cells expressing CEACAM1-4S with single Y448V, double Y445V/Y448V or quadruple G424L/G432L/Y445V/Y448V mutations produced tumors that were 1.9-, 1.25-, and 2.14-fold larger than those produced by cells transfected with the wild type protein (Figure 8). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of frozen tumor sections, confirmed that tumor nodules formed by 253-NT cells transfected with either wild type or transmembrane domain mutants remained strongly positive for CEACAM1-4S (Figure 9).",

To determine if the GXXXG motifs within the transmembrane domain of CEACAM1-4S played a role in the dimerization of CEACAM1-4S [36], [43], the effect of G to L mutations on CEACAM1-4S interactions was analyzed by Blue-Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). In BN-PAGE, Coomassie G-250 is used in place of SDS to coat proteins with a uniform negative charge without causing denaturation or disruption of protein-protein interactions [44]. As shown in Figure 10, wild type and single G-to-L mutants of CEACAM1 demonstrated an apparent molecular mass by BN-PAGE that was approximately 100 kDa higher than the double G to L mutant, a difference approximately the size of CEACAM1-4S resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE. These data suggested that a single GXXXG motif was sufficient to mediate dimerization of CEACAM1-4S and/or interaction with another yet-to-be identified transmembrane protein, interactions that appeared to require helix-helix interactions mediated by GXXXG motifs.",

The idea that CEACAM1 phenotypes could be context specific came from our previous studies showing that CEACAM1-4L expression dramatically suppressed the tumorigenicity of CEACAM1 negative PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells [13]. With continued passage, however, cells eventually reacquired a tumorigenic phenotype without losing expression of CEACAM1-4L, suggesting a strong selection for cells with proteomes that were unable to support CEACAM1 mediated tumor suppression. Context dependent effects on CEACAM1-4S phenotypes were also suggested by the ability of CEACAM1-4S to induce morphogenesis of MCF7 cells in vitro but not in vivo\n[21].",

For the latter protein, disruption of the GXXXG motif not only impaired oligomerization but also disrupted signaling [30], [46]. Previous investigations have shown that both the long and short isoforms of CEACAM1 form cis-dimers [36], [43], an interaction that we hypothesized should be stabilized by GXXXG mediated helix-helix associations. To test this idea, we introduced glycine-to-leucine mutations that disrupted one or more transmembrane domain GXXXG motifs. FACS, fluorescent confocal microscopic and immunoblot analysis of cells stably transfected with the glycine-to-leucine mutants confirmed that the mutant proteins were expressed on the cell surface at the same level and the same size as wild type CEACAM1-4S. However, after 3 weeks in soft agar, cells expressing single glycine mutants showed significantly lower rates of proliferation and significantly smaller colonies when compared to cells transfected with wild type CEACAM1-4S, suggesting that a single glycine-to-leucine mutation had compromised the ability of CEACAM1-4S to induce anchorage independent growth. From these results, we concluded that the smaller size of colonies produced by glycine mutants resulted at least in part from a decrease in the rate of proliferation.",

However, impaired dimerization could also occur if a reduction in GXXXG motifs destabilized cis-dimers formed by single glycine mutants with a subsequent reduction in their steady state levels. Blue native-PAGE analysis showed that the apparent size of the double but not the single glycine mutants showed approximately a 100 kDA decrease in size, a shift consistent with impaired dimerization. Moreover, since single glycine to leucine mutations produced the growth suppressed phenotype but only double mutations hampered dimerization, it was concluded that even without an apparent effect on dimerization, glycine to leucine point mutations in the transmembrane domain had a profound effect on the growth phenotype produced by CEACAM1-4S.",

Gain-of-function mutations are usually dominant, a characteristic apparent for the glycine/tyrosine mutants of CEACAM1-4S where the growth enhanced phenotype of tyrosine mutants was dominant over the growth inhibited phenotype resulting from glycine mutations. Based on the known functions of GXXXG motifs, it seems likely that the loss-of-function caused by glycine mutations is related to changes in helix-helix interactions that destabilize rather than prevent the formation of cis-dimers [28], [50], [51], a possibility consistent with the fact that single G424L or G432L mutations failed to disrupt dimerization (Figure 10) but did cause a decrease in anchorage independent growth. Also noteworthy is the marked decrease in cis-dimerization (Figure 10) when mutations were introduced at both G424 and G432, a result that suggested G424-AIA-G428 was a functional GXXXG motif capable of directing cis-dimerization in the absence of the two motifs centered on G432 and necessary to sustain the level of growth produced by wild type CEACAM1-4S. Although this conclusion is seemingly at odds with the 9 prediction algorithms that placed G424 outside the transmembrane domain (Table 1), we suggest that a combination of structural and functional data provides a more accurate location of the transmembrane domain, one that incorporates the GAIAG motif at the N-terminus.",

Put another way, the presence of both tyrosines appeared to be necessary to suppress anchorage independent growth, a suppressive effect that apparently involved more than interactions between aromatic side chains since in both single tyrosine to valine mutants (VFLY or YFLV) the remaining tyrosine was paired with F446. Whether the two tyrosines without phenylalanine would be able maintain the wild type CEACAM1-4S phenotype is an open question that is beyond the scope of the present investigation.",

            "text": "While the mechanism behind the gain-of-function produced by the Y mutations is less clear, there is increasing evidence supporting the functional importance of interactions between transmembrane aromatic amino acids [41]. Although aromatic residues make up only a small percentage of the amino acids in any given protein, they are generally the most highly conserved residues. Interactions between the aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tryptophan (W) or tyrosine are thought to involve pi-stacking, a process that creates an attractive force when aromatic rings assume energetically favored stacking geometries. Accumulating evidence suggests that pi-stacking plays an important role in molecular recognition and self assembly either by contributing energy for driving self assembly or by providing directionality and orientation through stacking geometries [52], [53]. When a bacterial transmembrane database was statistically analyzed by Sal-Man et al, these investigators found that aromatic pairs (WXXW or YXXY) were significantly over-represented compared to their predicted frequency, suggesting a functional role for these sequences [52]. The stabilization of transmembrane domain self-association following substitution of tyrosine for glutamine (Q) and serine (S) in the known dimerization motif, QXXS, provided support for this idea and led these authors to conclude that stabilization of transmembrane associations by aromatic residues may be a general mechanism for generating specificity in transmembrane-transmembrane interactions. In considering which amino acid to substitute for the transmembrane tyrosine residues, phenylalanine would intuitively seem to be the logical choice. However, based on recent reports, tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations may or may not disrupt function. Stevens et al [54] reported that a YS/FA mutation of the IgM transmembrane domain had no effect on anti-Ig induced signaling as measured by the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation and did not disrupt the association between IgM and its signaling partners, Ig-alpha/Ig-beta. In contrast, a YS/VV mutation diminished both signaling and association with Ig-alpha/Ig-beta. In cases where phenylalanine substitutions fail to mimic tyrosine, the lack of a properly spaced hydroxy group may be the reason [41]. Based on these considerations, it was decided to introduce tyrosine to valine mutations.",

            "text": "GXXXG motifs and aromatic amino acids are common features of the transmembrane domains of many different plasma membrane proteins with GXXXG motifs most often located at the N-terminus [55], [56], [57] and Y/F/W aromatic amino acids at the C-terminus of the transmembrane domain [58], [59]. Many of the proteins also have Sternberg-Gullick dimerization motifs, a family of sequences discovered in the transmembrane domain of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors [60]. Members of this family, which includes a subset of GXXXG/AXXXG/SXXXG dimerization motifs, are composed of 5 amino acids arranged with G, A, S, T or P in the first position (N-terminus), an A, V, L or I in the fourth position and G or A in the fifth position. Our findings demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution in the transmembrane domain of CEACAM1-4S can produce dramatic effects on cell proliferation, anchorage independent growth and in vivo tumorigenicity. It seems clear that the transmembrane domain and more specifically GXXXG motifs and tyrosine residues make a significant contribution to the functionality of CEACAM1-4S and by extension, to other transmembrane proteins with similar characteristics. Further studies are needed to define the downstream signaling events impacted by re-expression of CEACAM1-4S or by transmembrane domain mutations, studies that should provide valuable insights into events controlled by transmembrane domain mediated interactions. Of particular interest will be the identity of pathways inactivated/activated by tyrosine mutations that lead to the positive growth effects of tyrosine mutations and the ability of these pathways to counteract the tumor suppressor activity of CEACAM1-4L, the larger splice variant with the same transmembrane domain as the 4S isoform.",
