C. burnetii displays antigenic variation with an infectious phase I and less infectious phase II. The primary reservoir from which human infection occurs consists of sheep, goat and cattle. Although C. burnetii infections in animals are usually asymptomatic, they may cause abortions in sheep and goats[1]. High concentrations of C. burnetii can be found in birth products of infected mammals[2]. Humans frequently acquire infection through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from parturient fluids, placenta or wool[1]. Because the infectious dose is very low[3] and C. burnetii is able to survive in a spore-like state for months to years, outbreaks among humans have also occurred through contaminated dust carried by wind over large distances [4-6].",

The clinical presentation of acute Q fever is variable and can resemble many other infectious diseases[2]. However, the most frequent clinical manifestation of acute Q fever is a self-limited febrile illness associated with severe headache. Atypical pneumonia and hepatitis are the major clinical manifestations of more severe disease. Acute Q fever may be complicated by meningoencephalitis or myocarditis. Rarely a chronic form of Q fever develops months after the acute illness, most commonly in the form of endocarditis[1]. Children develop clinical disease less frequently[7,8]. Because of its non-specific presentation Q fever can only be suspected on clinical grounds and requires serologic confirmation. While the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is considered to be the reference method, complement fixation (CF), ELISA and microagglutination (MA) can also be used[9]. Acute infections are diagnosed by elevated IgG and/or IgM anti-phase II antibodies, while raised anti-phase I IgG antibodies are characteristic for chronic infections[1].",

Potential controls who became ill were excluded for analysis in CCS2, but were still fully interviewed.

The predominant wind direction during the market was south-south-east (Figure 1). For the purpose of the analysis we divided the market area into 4 sections with the sheep pen at its center. In section 1 the wind was blowing towards the sheep pen (plus minus 45\u00b0). Section 4 was on the opposite side, i.e. where the wind blew from the sheep pen towards the stands, and sections 2 and 3 were east and west with respect to the wind direction, respectively. Location of the stands in reference to the sheep pen was thus defined in two ways: as the absolute distance to the sheep pen (in stand units or meters) and in reference to the wind direction.",

The organizers estimated that on May 4 about 3000 persons visited the market. Based on data from CCS2 83% of visitors were adults and 17% were children. Thus the total number of adult visitors was estimated as 2490. With an attack rate among adults of 20% the estimated number of ill adults was 498. Since the number of notified adults was 291 the proportion of illl adults that was notified was 58%. If there were 2490 adult visitors then children comprised 510 (= 3000\u20132490) visitors. Assuming that the reporting rate among children is the same as in adults then the number of reported children/reporting rate gives the estimated number of ill children. This yields 8/0,58 = 14 ill children. Therefore the estimated AR among children was 14/510 = 2.7%. The total estimated number of persons with clinical Q fever would be 498 + 14 = 512. In the sensitivity analysis we varied the number of visitors between 2000 and 5000, the proportion of adult visitors between 60% and 90% and the attack rate among adults between 15% and 30% (Table 3). In all scenarios the AR among adults was significantly higher than that among children (Figure 5).",

The fact that only attendance on the second, but not the first day was strongly associated with illness pointed towards the role of the ewe that had given birth in the early morning hours of May 4, 2005. This strong association and the very high attributable fraction among all cases suggested a point source and justified defining cases notified through the reporting system as outbreak cases if they were clinically compatible with Q fever and gave a history of having visited the farmers' market. The point-source nature of the outbreak permitted calculation of the incubation period of cases which averaged 21 days and ranged from 2 to 48 days with an interquartile range of 16 to 24 days. This is compatible with the literature[1]. An additional interview with the two cases with early onset (2 and 4 days after attending the market on May 4, respectively) could not identify any other source of infection. A short incubation period was recently observed in another Q fever outbreak in which the infectious dose was likely very high[17].",

The study failed to show a significant role of the location of the stand in reference to the wind direction, although we must take into account that the wind was likely not always and exactly as reported by the weather station. However, if the wind had been important at all more cases might have been expected to have occurred among vendors situated at a greater distance to the sheep.",

It is unlikely that hospitals reported cases with Q fever more frequently than private physicians because the proportion hospitalized among Q fever patients identified through random telephone calls in the Soest population or those in the two cohorts was similar to that of notified cases. Thus reporting bias is an unlikely explanation for the relatively high proportion of cases hospitalized.

The estimate of 23% based on the random sample of persons visiting the market on the second day would seem most immune to recall bias, even if this cannot be entirely ruled out. The estimation based on information about persons accompanying the cases may be subject to an overestimation because these individuals presumably had a higher probability of being close to the sheep pen, similar to the cases. On the other hand the estimate from the cohort study on vendors might be an underestimate, since the vendors obviously had a different purpose for being at the market and may have been less interested in having a look at the sheep. Nevertheless, all estimates were independent from each other and considering the various possible biases, they were remarkably similar. In comparison, in a different outbreak in Germany, in which inhabitants of a village were exposed to a large herd of sheep (n = 1000\u20132000)[5,7] the attack rate was estimated as 16%. In a similar outbreak in Switzerland several villages were exposed to approximately 900 sheep[19]. In the most severely affected village, the clinical attack rate was 16% (estimated from the data provided)[19].

During the past decades urbanization of rural areas and changes in animal husbandry have occurred[20], with more recent attempts to put a \"deprived\" urban population \"in touch\" with farm animals. Petting zoos, family farm vacations or the display of (farm) animals at a market such as this may lead to new avenues for the transmission of zoonotic infectious agents[20,22-24]. While not all eventualities can be foreseen, it is important to raise awareness in pet and livestock owners as well as to strengthen recommendations where necessary. This outbreak led to the amendment and extension of existing recommendations[25] which now forbid the display of sheep in the latter third of their pregnancy and require regular testing of animals for C. burnetii in petting zoos, where there is close contact between humans and animals.",
