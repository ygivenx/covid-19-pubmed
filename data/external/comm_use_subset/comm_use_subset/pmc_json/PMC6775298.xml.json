            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the causative agents of human and a variety of animal diseases. In human, CoVs evoke respiratory tract infection and cause common cold or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1-3. In animals, CoVs also lead to life-threatening diseases, such as severe enteric and respiratory tract infections, and are economically important pathogens4-7. TGEV is a member of Coronaviridae and causes TGE. TGE is a highly contagious gastroenteric disease of swine and results in high mortality of less than 2-week-old piglet. TGEV infection can evoke mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and cell death8, 9. TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage is a key factor of inflammation and is caused by abnormal opening of mitochondrial permeability transmission pore (mPTP)10. Persistent opening of mPTP can lead to decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u25b3\u03c8m), reduction of ATP production, release of ROS from mitochondria, finally mitochondrial damage11-14. Viral infection is one of the important factors for mitochondrial injury15-18. Studies have confirmed that TGEV infection can cause intracellular mitochondrial injury. For example, TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 can cause intracellular mitochondrial autophagy19. PK-15 cells infected with TGEV can appear mitochondrial injury, showing an increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ and mitochondrial membrane permeability20, 21.",

Hepatitis B virus x protein (HBx) inhibits HBV-induced apoptosis through activating NF-\u03baB in primary rat hepatocytes. Suppression of mPTP results in HBx-induced apoptosis, indicating NF-\u03baB is strongly linked to mPTP25. Activation of NF-\u03baB by TNF-\u03b1 decreases calcium induced mPTP opening via repressing ANT126. Recently, we reported that mitochondrial damage was caused by TGEV infection. Moreover, circEZH2 enhanced activation of NF-\u03baB pathway via sponging miR-22 during TGEV-induced inflammation process 21. circEZH2 is comprised of exon 2 to 8 of EZH2 (ENSSSCG00000028840) and is derived from 109, 411, 982 bp -109, 431, 724 bp region of the sense strand of Chromosome 9. NF-\u03baB pathway is an important pathway that related to regulating mitochondrial damage and inflammation27. So, we propose a hypothesis that circEZH2 may regulate mPTP opening via miR-22.",

The circular RNA ssc_circ_009380 was differentially down-regulated during TGEV infection21. Analysis of ssc_circ_009380 sequence showed that it was comprised of exon 2 to 8 of EZH2 (ENSSSCG00000028840) that derived from 109, 411, 982-109, 431, 724 bp regions of the sense strand of Chromosome 9 (Figure 2A). Therefore, circular RNA ssc_circ_009380 was named \"circEZH2\". To confirm the circular characteristics of circEZH2, we next digested total RNA with or without RNase R. Compared to the linear \u03b2-actin mRNAs, circEZH2 was obviously resistant to Rnase R (Figure 2B). In addition, we found circEZH2 was localized at both nuclear and cytoplasm (Figure 2C and D). Meanwhile, The levels of circEZH2 were measured by qRT-PCR and FISH. The results revealed that circEZH2 was down-regulated during TGEV infection in vitro (Figure 2E and Figure S1) and in vivo (Figure 2F and Figure S1), which is correlated with the Solexa high-throughput sequencing. To investigate the impact of circEZH2 on mPTP opening induced by TGEV, IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with pcircRNA-circEZH2 (or pcircRNA, si-circEZH2, NC siRNA) and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h. The circEZH2 level was significantly increased by pcircRNA-circEZH2 and remarkably decreased by si-circEZH2 (Figure 2G and H). The level of mPTP opening was tested using BBcellProbeTM M61 probe. These results suggested fluorescence intensity of cells infected with TGEV significantly increased by pcircRNA-circEZH2 and significantly decreased by si-circEZH2 in comparison with negative control (Figure 2I to K).",

GO enrichment analysis of the 197 genes was performed and presented (Table S3). The result showed that 30 target genes were localized at mitochondria or participated in the immune system process (Figure 5C and D). To identify the targets, 16 target genes of miR-22 that related to mitochondrion and inflammation were selected for identification. The 3' UTR of the 16 target genes were cloned into 3' UTR of dual-luciferase reporter plasmid to gain the recombinant plasmid. The luciferase activities were detected. The results showed that luciferase activity of plasmid containing the 3' UTR of HK2 was markedly lower than that of other targets (Figure 5E). To further identify the direct binding between miR-22 and 3' UTR of HK2 mRNA, the binding site of miR-22 seed sequence at HK2 3' UTR were mutated with the 4-bp substitution (Figure 5F). The constructs and miR-22 mimics (or miRNA mimics control, miR-22 inhibitor, miRNA inhibitor control) were co-transfected into IPEC-J2 cells. The luciferase activities were measured. Compared with the control, introduction of exogenous miR-22 decreased the psi-HK2-WT reporter activity by 45%, while over-expression and inhibition of miR-22 did not affect luciferase activity (Figure 5G and H). The effects of miR-22 on transcription and expression of HK2 were tested using real-time PCR and western blot. The results indicated that the transcriptional level of HK2 was not influenced by miR-22 mimics and inhibitor (Figure 5I). However, the protein level of HK2 was down-regulated by miR-22 mimics and up-regulated by miR-22 inhibitor (Figure 5J).

Previous studies have confirmed that IL-6 was involved in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway34. To determine the direct interaction between miR-22 and 3' UTR of IL-6 mRNA, the porcine IL-6 3' UTR or its mutant was respectively cloned into the 3' UTR of a Renilla luciferase gene in a luciferase reporter psiCHECK-2 (Figure 7A). The constructs and miR-22 mimics (or miRNA mimics control, miR-22 inhibitor, miRNA inhibitor control) were co-transfected into IPEC-J2 cells. Compared with the control, introduction of exogenous miR-22 decreased the psi-IL-6-WT reporter activity by 62%, while overexpression and knockdown of miR-22 using miR-22 mimics and inhibitor did not affect psi-IL-6-Mut reporter activity (Figure 7B and C). To determine whether miR-22 inhibited IL-6 expression on mRNA level, miR-22 mimics (or miRNA mimics control, miR-22 inhibitor, miRNA inhibitor control) was transfected into IPEC-J2 cells. The mRNA level of IL-6 was assessed by real-time PCR. Introduction of exogenous miR-22 decreased mRNA level of IL-6 in IPEC-J2 cells. Knockdown of endogenous miR-22 using miR-22 inhibitor increased the mRNA level of IL-6 (Figure 7D).To investigate the effect of IL-6 on NF-\u03baB pathway, IPEC-J2 were transfected with si-IL-6 or NC siRNA, and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h. The results showed that p-p65 significantly decreased at protein level by si-IL-6 (Figure 7E and F). To examine whether miR-22 suppressed NF-\u03baB pathway via interacting with IL-6, miR-22 inhibitor and the si-IL-6 were co-transfected into IPEC-J2. The results revealed that p-p65 significantly down-regulated in IPEC-J2 by miR-22 inhibitor and si-IL-6 co-transfection in comparison with miR-22 inhibitor alone (Figure 7G). To investigate the effect of IL-6 on mPTP opening, IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with si-IL-6 or NC siRNA, and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h. The level of mPTP opening was detected using flow cytometry. The results showed that fluorescence intensity for BBcellProbeTM M61 significantly decreased by si-IL-6 (Figure 7H and I), indicating that IL-6 decreased TGEV-induced mPTP opening. IPEC-J2 cells were pretreated with 10 \u03bcM NF-\u03baB inhibitor (BAY 11-7082) for 60 min and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h. The level of mPTP opening was detected using flow cytometry. The results showed that fluorescence intensity for BBcellProbeTM M61 significantly decreased by BAY 11-7082 (NF-\u03baB inhibitor) (Figure 7J-L).",

HK2 interacts with VDAC1 to change the conformation of VDAC1, which leads to an inhibition of mPTP opening 48-50. This correlates with our discovery that silencing HK2, the target of miR-22, aggravates TGEV-induced mPTP opening. However, HK2 does not regulate NK-\u03baB activation. Not only HK2, IL-6 was also identified as the target of miR-22 and suppressed TGEV-induced mPTP opening via activating NF-\u03baB pathway, suggesting that miR-22 regulates TGEV-induced mPTP opening via at least two pathways. Our finding is supported by the discovery that IL-6 reduces hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial damage via Bcl-2-induced Bak-mitofusions interaction and activates NF-\u03baB pathway through STAT3 pathway34, 51 and provides a new mechanism of miR-22 in mitochondrial function.",
