Among these, paired sera showing a fourfold increase in IgG antibody titer has been considered as a more reliable method for the diagnosis of current M. pneumoniae infection [6-8]. However, because of difficulty in obtaining convalescent serum and time constraints, IgG antibody titer tests of paired sera are an epidemiological rather than a diagnostic tool. Culture of this organism is slow [9], and the correlation between culture and infection is tenuous because of the asymptomatic infection caused by M. pneumoniae[10,11]. The detection of IgM antibody titer in acute stage serum and fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) of throat swabs are faster techniques, but until now, a direct comparison between paired sera results and the above three assays, especially the FQ-PCR kit approved by State Food and Drug Administration of China, has not been made.",

Touati et al. have evaluated five commercial kits based on PCR, and found that the sensitivities of the kits were 62\u201398% [23].

The low sensitivity of PCR testing may be due to the low bacterial load resulting from previous antimicrobial treatment or dilution of the sample in the throat swabs below the limit of detection. The detection limit of our FQ-PCR kit is stated as 10 copies per \u03bcl in the manual, which is lower than 0.1\u20131 copies per \u03bcl that other commercial kits reported [23,24]. In addition, it was found that the efficiency of the PCR assay could be influenced by sample type, and sputum could be superior to other respiratory samples including throat swab [25].",

Five patients (three positive by FQ-PCR and culture, and two positive by FQ-PCR or culture and IgM test) showed 2.5\u20133.8 fold increase of IgG response, which could be explained by an inadequate time interval (mean interval was 17 days).
