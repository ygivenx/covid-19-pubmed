HeV was initially identified during an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in horses in Australia in 1994. To date, 7 human cases of HeV infection have been identified, all associated with direct contact with infected horses and with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 57% [2]. NiV was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of acute respiratory and neurological disease in pigs in 1998\u201399 that led to infections in humans in Malaysia (283 cases) and Singapore (11 cases) with a CFR of 38% [3]. Subsequent outbreaks of NiV have occurred almost yearly in humans in Bangladesh and India with increased CFR (75%) and higher prevalence of respiratory disease (from 40% to 75%) [2, 4]. In addition, human-to-human transmission has only been observed during outbreaks of NiV in Bangladesh. The NiV strains isolated during outbreaks in Malaysia and Bangladesh are genetically distinct and have been designated as the Malaysia strain (NiV-M) and Bangladesh strain (NiV-B), respectively [5, 6].",

Interestingly, in that same model, a recent study showed that NiV-B is more pathogenic, similar to what is seen during outbreaks of human disease [10]. The differences in the pathogenic mechanisms of these strains, which ultimately drive the disparity of clinical outcomes and transmission profiles, remain largely unknown.",

Clinical signs were first noticeable on day 5 post infection (pi), and included development of fever, labored breathing, mild paralysis, generalized tremors and subcutaneous edema of the head and neck, followed by rapidly progressing clinical signs on days 6 and 7 pi. This coincided with a small increase in body temperature of HeV and NiV-B infected animals on day 5 pi (S1 Fig). Moribund animals displayed clinical signs that included lack of grooming, hunched posture, ataxia, severe depression, labored breathing, occasional subcutaneous edema of the neck and head, vomiting; and neurological signs such as continuous licking, tremors, imbalance, myoclonus, head tilt, hind limb paralysis and seizures. The majority of animals succumbed of infection by day 6\u20138 pi with a lethal dose 50% (LD50) for HeV, NiV-B and NiV-M of 5, 32 and 22 TCID50, respectively (Fig 1A\u20131C). Several ferrets receiving low infective doses (10 or 102 TCID50) displayed no clinical signs throughout the period of observation and did not seroconvert, suggesting that the LD50 is also the minimal infectious dose at which 50% is infected.",

Once animals were moribund, no significant differences in viral shedding in nasal washes were observed between the 3 virus strains.

Specifically, HeV caused extensive activation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (classified as Gene Ontology: Response to Type I Interferon) by 3 dpi that remained active by 5 dpi (27 and 30 upregulated ISGs, respectively); on the other hand, the activation of the antiviral responses during NiV-B occurred at a later time-point (0 upregulated ISGs by 3 dpi, and 32 by 5 dpi) (Fig 3B and 3C).The activation of other immune-related gene categories, including Cytokine Activity, Leukocyte Chemotaxis, Jak-STAT Signaling Pathway and Complement and Coagulation Cascades, also reached their highest degree of activation by 5 dpi with NiV-B causing a later start of these processes (Fig 3B). Also, enrichment of genes that belong to the protein-protein interaction (PPI) hubs of transcription factors, such as members of the STAT and IRF families, confirms the activation of genes related to immune responses in general and antiviral responses in particular (Fig 3D). Overall, these results indicate that the changes in the gene expression profiles in the lung tissue occurred in a time-dependent manner that parallels the replication kinetics of each virus and disease onset; NiV-B displayed a later activation of the immune responses as compared to HeV, but by 5 dpi, the two viruses display very similar profiles of gene activation both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

Genes of the Extracellular Matrix functional category, such as collagen proteins and other structural genes related to tissue repair, also display a marked downregulation during Henipavirus infection (Fig 4B). Moreover, gene members of the TGF-beta, Wnt/beta-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways, which are directly involved in the regulation of growth and cell cycle, were also downregulated. This scenario is further confirmed by enrichment of genes that belong to the protein-protein interaction hubs of transcription factors such as CTNNB1, SMAD3 and SMAD4 (Fig 4C), which are central components of the TGF-beta and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways. We also found that the expression landscape of genes with growth factor activity, some of which may be impacting the regulatory environment of the lung, is split towards up- and down regulation (Fig 4B).",

As the respiratory infection progresses, the intensity of the local responses escalate beyond a biological threshold and triggers the activation of the endothelial cells, which, in turn, orchestrate and amplify the cytokine and chemokine responses leading to systemic immune activation, as shown for influenza virus [33].",

Henipavirus infection results in increasing expression and broadening repertoires of mediators of inflammation, including cytokines, chemokines, CAMs, and also, increased expression levels of macrophage markers (CD14, CD40, CD80, CD86, CD274 and LY96) due to the influx of these cells into the infected lung tissue (Fig 3E). The development of tissue damage also coincided with the onset of clinical signs (Fig 2B\u20132D), and is possibly driven by the strong activation of NF-kb mediated responses that lead to high levels of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in the lung, a scenario that is commonly found in respiratory infections of viral origin [8, 9, 21, 32, 36]. One caveat in this study is that tissues used for host gene expression analysis were not perfused to remove blood which could potentially \u201ccontaminate\u201d host gene expression profiles. However, given that the levels of viremia were very low, this effect was not considered to be an important factor in characterizing the host response.",

As part of this process, the influx of lymphocytes into the infected lung tissue is commonly observed during experimental infections in vivo; for instance, this process is detectable during influenza infection in mice by 4 dpi (increased levels of CD8+ and CD19+ cells) [38, 39], and in ferrets by 5 dpi (increased mRNA expression of lymphocyte markers) [17]. Strikingly, we found that the infection with HeV and NiV-B did not modify the expression levels of lymphocyte markers (CD2, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD4, CD8A and CD27) in the lung tissue by 5 dpi (Fig 3F). These results point to a deficit or delay of lymphocyte activity in the lung; additional studies are required to profile the behavior of the different lymphocyte populations in the lung and their subsequent functional implications in the context of henipavirus infection.",

The capacity of henipaviruses to spread to lymphoid tissues, including the infection of lymph nodes [42] and the infection of the spleen that was found in the present study (Fig 2J) and also by others [43], has been previously linked to a subsequent loss of immune responsiveness [43]. Nonetheless, it has not yet been established whether this capacity of henipaviruses to infect lymphoid organs is the result of non-specific systemic spread, or mediated by selective targeting of immune cells; if confirmed, the latter scenario would bear resemblance to that observed in measles infection, where the capacity of the virus to target immune cells [44] contributes to the hallmark immunosuppressive capability of measles virus [45, 46].",

            "text": "This study is the first comprehensive characterization of the host gene expression during henipavirus infection, by taking advantage of the recently published ferret genome and transcriptome and a well characterized ferret model for henipavirus infection. Overall, these data show that genetically and phenotypically distinct henipavirus strains differ in the kinetics of disease and host responses, rather than the magnitude. This is similar to observation with different SARS-CoV strains [24, 53]. Infection with henipaviruses, is associated with a strong host innate immune response, which contributes to severe respiratory stress and lethality. Fig 6 recapitulates the major findings in terms of viral spread across body compartments and host responses in the lung and brain tissues during henipavirus infection in ferrets. Although the molecular mechanisms governing henipavirus pathogenesis remain unknown, these studies reveal a strategy for dissecting the genetic pathways by which henipavirus infection induces changes in the host response in lung and brain, leading to death.",
