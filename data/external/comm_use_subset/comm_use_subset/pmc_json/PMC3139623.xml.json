ORF1 encodes a polyprotein precursor termed as nsP1234 and processed into different non structural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4) after stepwise proteolytic cleavages. The 3\u2032-terminal one-third of the genome encodes for viral structural polyprotein which is expressed from a separate subgenomic mRNA and cleaved co-translationally and posttranslationally into structural proteins C, E1, E2 [1]. Alphavirus nsP4, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the processing intermediates or mature products of nsP123 are essential components of the viral RNA replication and transcription complexes [2].",

One strand in each of the three RNA or DNA duplexes was 5\u2032-end labeled. Duplex unwinding assays were carried out at similar conditions which were optimized for the ATPase activity. There was no detectable strand displacement by CHIKV-nsP2T with any of the RNA/DNA duplexes with 1 nM protein/reaction (Figure 4a). Further, unwinding assays were carried out using different concentrations of the enzyme from 1 ng-1000 ng/reaction. There was no visible unwinding activity seen even at higher concentrations of enzyme in the reactions (Figure 4b).",

Following incubation with the CHIKV-nsP2T at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, products were analyzed by TLC. 5\u2032-[\u03b3-32P]-RNA or 5\u2032-[\u03b1-32P]-RNA substrates were separately incubated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) to see the specificity of CHIKV-nsP2T for phosphate group at the 5\u2032-end of the RNA substrate. As expected, SAP could remove 32P moiety from both RNA substrates, but CHIKV-nsP2T showed no release of label from 5\u2032-\u03b1-32P-RNA. CHIKV-nsP2T released labeled 5\u2032-phosphate group from 5\u2032-\u03b3-32P labeled RNA indicating that CHIKV-nsP2T hydrolyzes only \u03b3-\u03b2-triphosphate bond and unlike SAP does not have a general phosphohydrolase activity that would also remove the \u03b2- and \u03b1- phosphate groups (Figure 5a). This suggested that CHIKV-nsP2T has 5\u2032-RNA-triphosphatase (RTPase) activity. Extent of hydrolysis of both CHIKV 5\u2032-NCR and non specific RNA oligo substrates was comparable (Figure 5b).

ADP and AMP did not affect the RTPase activity even at 5 mM concentration (Figure 6a), suggesting that the 5\u2032-terminal \u03b3-phosphate group in the substrate is the major determinant for competition. These data led us to conclude that CHIKV-nsP2T NTPase and RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities have a common active site and 5\u2032-terminal \u03b3- and \u03b2-phosphate groups interact with the NTPase/RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activity domain of CHIKV-nsP2T.",

Other possibility is that unwinding activity of CHIKV-nsP2 is dependent on the protease domain. Helicase motifs identified until now are actually characteristic of NTP-dependent nucleic acid translocases which are capable of moving unidirectionally along a single or double stranded nucleic acid. Extra domains in addition to core enzyme (need not be from the same protein) may be necessary for conferring strand separation activity to the enzyme.

            "text": "Alphaviruses possess a novel RNA capping mechanism, where GTP is first methylated, forms a covalent m7GMP intermediate with nsP1and then gets transferred on to RNA resulting in G0 cap structure. Methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities required to carry out these reactions have been demonstrated to be nsP1 associated [30]. There is prior step of removing 5\u2032 \u03b3- phosphate of the nascent RNA and nsP2 has been identified as the RNA triphosphatase for both SFV and SINV [6]. On testing CHIKV-nsP2T for RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase (RTPase) activity, it released 32P only from the 5\u2032-[\u03b3-32P] RNA and not from the 5\u2032-[\u03b1-32P] RNA substrate showing specificity for the \u03b3 - \u03b2 -triphosphate bond (Figure 5a) confirming CHIKV-nsP2T having RTPase activity. Release of the 5\u2032-phosphate group from the nonspecific RNA oligonucleotide substrate and that from the CHIKV 5\u2032-NCR were equally efficient. This showed that CHIKV-nsP2T 5\u2032-RTPase has no sequence specificity for RNA substrates. RNA-5\u2032 triphosphatase activity of the mutant proteins showed significant inhibition (Figure 6c) suggesting that the NTPase and RTPase activities shared a common reaction mechanism. The effective inhibition of RTPase with 0.1 mM ATP and not with ADP and AMP further confirmed that the enzyme binds by means of triphosphorylated nucleotide. In summary, CHIKV-nsP2T has both NTPase and RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities. It could hydrolyze all NTPs except dTTP and showed better efficiency for ATP, dATP, GTP and dGTP hydrolysis. ATP was the most preferred substrate by the enzyme. RTPase activity was completely inhibited by ATP showing sharing of the binding motif by NTP and RNA. NTPase and RTPase activities were completely dependent on Mg2+ ions. Walker A and Walker B mutant proteins showed significant reduction in both enzymatic activities confirming sharing of functional domains for these activities. This is the first report showing CHIKV-nsP2 associated NTPase and RNA 5\u2032-triphosphatase activities. Considering importance of these functions during alphavirus replication, helicase could serve as a potential target for antivirals.",
