It belongs to the Coronaviridae family (genus Betacoronavirus), which is part of the order Nidovirales. MERS-CoV was isolated in 2012 from the sputum of a 60 year old man suffering from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia [1]. Since its discovery, MERS-CoV has caused 2,442 human infections of which 842 (34.5%) had a fatal outcome (as of May, 2019) [2]. Dromedary camels are reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV and display only common cold-like symptoms upon infection but constitute the main source of human infections. Transmission to humans occurs via close contact to animals or contaminated animal products [3\u20136]. Human-to-human transmissions seem limited and were mainly observed in health care settings, leading to MERS outbreaks in hospitals [7\u201312]. Finally, differences in the tissue specific expression of the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV, DPP4, were recently suggested to account for the differences in MERS-CoV transmission and disease induction in camels and humans, respectively [13,14].",

This process is facilitated by the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, a type-I transmembrane protein embedded in the viral envelope. For host cell entry, the surface unit, S1, of MERS-CoV S binds to the cellular type-II transmembrane protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) [15]. The structure of the interface between DPP4 and MERS-CoV-S was resolved on the atomic level and fifteen residues in DPP4 were found to make direct contact with residues in the viral S protein [16]. Upon DPP4 engagement, MERS-CoV S undergoes proteolytic activation through the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 or the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L [17\u201319], which allows the transmembrane unit, S2, of MERS-CoV S to fuse the viral membrane with cellular membranes.",

Mature DPP4 is embedded in the plasma membrane as a homodimer and each monomer consists of an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, followed by a transmembrane domain and a large ectodomain, which can be further subdivided into a short stalk domain, a glycosylation-rich and a cysteine-rich region as well as the C-terminal catalytic domain (\u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase domain) [26]. Polymorphisms in the DPP4 gene were implicated in several diseases and conditions, including diabetes [27,28] and myocardial infarction [29] but their potential impact on MERS-CoV infection has not been analyzed.",

Then, the cells were washed with PBS and mixed with 2x SDS-sample buffer (0.03 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA). Cell lysis was achieved by incubating the samples for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation at 96 \u00b0C for an additional 10 min. The samples were further loaded on polyacrylamide gels and SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was performed. Next, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hartenstein GmbH) by immunoblotting. The membranes were further blocked by incubation in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterwards, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with undiluted supernatant of a hybridoma cell line secreting anti-cMYC antibody 9E10 (for DPP4 detection) or PBS-T containing anti-\u00df-actin (ACTB) antibody (mouse, 1:1,000, Sigma Aldrich).

Finally, the frequency of these polymorphisms in the human population is low, ranging roughly from 1:19,000 (A289V) to 1:245,000 (T288I) (Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 1).",

As expected, VSVpp harboring VSV G were able to efficiently transduce BHK-21 target cells irrespective of DPP4 expression. In contrast, transduction of BHK-21 cells mediated by MERS-CoV S critically depended on ectopic expression of human DPP4, in accordance with published findings [47] (Figure 4). Notably, four DPP4 polymorphisms - K267E, K267N, A291P and \u0394346\u2013348 - severely reduced MERS-CoV S-driven transduction compared to DPP4 WT (Figure 4). In order to analyze whether the reduction in MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry would translate into attenuated MERS-CoV replication, we next investigated two DPP4 polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) in the context of infection with authentic MERS-CoV. When followed over a period of two days post infection it was observed that MERS-CoV replication in BHK-21 cells expressing human DPP4 was significantly reduced when DPP4 contained either K267E or A291P (Figure 5).\n\n",

For this, we used soluble MERS-CoV S, produced by fusing the S1 subunit, which contains the DPP4 binding domain, to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (solMERS-S1-Fc). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that DPP4 variants harboring polymorphisms K267E, K267N or A291P, which were not compatible with efficient MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry, displayed significantly reduced ability to interact with MERS-CoV S as indicated by weaker DPP4 signals upon protein A-sepharose-mediated pull-down of DPP4/solMERS-S1-Fc (as compared to DPP4 WT, Figure 6A-B). Notably, DPP4 variant \u0394346\u2013348 could be as efficiently co-immunoprecipitated as DPP4 WT, indicating that its inefficient receptor function was solely due to its defect in proper surface transport. The findings obtained by co-IP analysis were confirmed by flow cytometry. It was revealed that polymorphisms that reduced MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry (K267E, K267N, A291P and \u0394346\u2013348) and spread of authentic MERS-CoV (K267E and A291P) also reduced MERS-CoV S binding to cells expressing DPP4 on the cell surface (Figure 6C). In addition, polymorphism A289V, which decreased MERS-CoV S-driven transduction to a lesser extent than the aforementioned polymorphisms (Figure 4), also reduced MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4. Thus, DPP4 polymorphisms K267E, K267N and A291P reduce MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry and MERS-CoV infection by diminishing MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4.\n",

However, the impact of natural-occurring variations on host cell entry of MERS-CoV has not been addressed so far.

Four polymorphisms located at three different sites in DPP4 (K267E, K267N, A291P and \u0394346\u2013348) severely reduced S protein-driven host cell entry. As DPP4 \u0394346\u2013348 was shown to be incompatible with robust cell surface transport but able to interact with MERS-CoV S in co-IP analysis, we conclude that the reduction in entry efficiency is solely due to insufficient DPP4 surface levels. In contrast, reduction of host cell entry by K267E, K267N and A291P could not be explained by reduced DPP4 expression and these polymorphisms were thus further investigated. MERS-CoV infection of BHK-21 cells transfected to express DPP4 WT and variants K267E or A291P revealed that K267E or A291P were not compatible with robust MERS-CoV replication.

DPP4 residue K267 has been reported to contact MERS-CoV S residues G538 and D539, including a salt bridge interaction with D539 [16]. The exchange of K267 to either glutamate (E) or asparagine (N) likely abolishes/decreases the interaction with MERS-S due to the different biochemical properties of K267 (positively charged, basic) versus E267 (negatively charged, acidic) and N267 (not charged, acidic) (Supplementary Figure 1). For DPP4 residue A291, which has been reported to contact the MERS-CoV S residue E513, no information on the type of interaction is available [16]. Here, we speculate that the bulky and distorted side chain of proline (in comparison to the small side chain of alanine) abolishes/decreases interaction with MERS-CoV S residue E513 (Supplementary Figure 1). In contrast to that, valine contains a small side chain and also has identical biochemical properties as alanine and thus might be efficiently contacted by E513 of MERS-CoV S, which is why we did not observe any impact of polymorphisms A291V on MERS-CoV S-driven entry and MERS-CoV S MERS-CoV S binding/interaction (Supplementary Figure 1).",

Indeed, we obtained initial evidence to support such a concept. Thus, we found that residue 539 in MERS-CoV S which contacts DPP4 residue 267 is polymorphic, with certain MERS-CoV variants harboring an asparagine instead of an aspartate residue at this position. D539N reduced entry into cells expressing relatively low amounts of DPP4 but had no effect on entry into cells expressing high amounts of DPP4 (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, and more interestingly, D539N slightly rescued MERS-CoV S-driven entry from the negative effect exerted by DPP4 polymorphism K267N (Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, residue 510 in MERS-CoV S, which is known to interact with DPP4 residues 317 and 322, was found to be polymorphic, and previous studies demonstrated that polymorphism D510G reduced DPP4 binding but also increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies [37]. Notably, D510G slightly increased entry via DPP4 harboring polymorphism Y322H and allowed MERS-CoV S to use DPP4 with polymorphism R317K with the same efficiency as WT DPP4. It should be stated that none of these effects was statistically significant and that DPP4 and MERS-CoV S polymorphisms occur with low frequency. Although it is unlikely that the DPP4 polymorphisms have emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure from MERS-CoV infections, our results suggest that certain existing DPP4 polymorphism(s) might foster the emergence of MERS-CoV variants with altered biological properties.",

For normalization, the MFI value of the negative control was subtracted from all samples. Further, surface expression of DPP4 WT was set as 100% and the relative surface expression of the DPP4 mutants was calculated accordingly. Shown are the combined data of three experiments with error bars indicating the SEM. Statistical significance for differences in surface expression between WT and mutant DPP4 was tested by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett\u2019s posttest (p > 0.05, not significant; p \u2264 0.05, *). (B) DPP4 surface expression was further analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis. For this, DPP4 WT or DPP4 mutants were expressed in BHK-21 cells grown on coverslips (cells transfected with empty expression vector served as negative control). After fixation of the cells, surface expressed DPP4 was stained by subsequent incubation of non-permeabilized cells with a primary antibody that targets the DPP4 ectodomain and an AlexaFluor568-conjugated secondary antibody. In addition, cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI. Finally, images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope at a magnification of 80x.",

Two DPP4 mutants that showed reduced compatibility for MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of infection and replication of authentic MERS-CoV. For this, BHK-21 cells expressing wildtype (WT) or mutant DPP4, or no DPP4 at all (negative control) were inoculated with MERS-CoV. At 1 h postinfection, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed before they received fresh culture medium and were further incubated.

In order to investigate whether reduced MERS-CoV S-driven host cell entry and MERS-CoV replication is due to inefficient MERS-CoV S binding to DPP4 harboring amino acid polymorphisms at the binding interface, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) as well as binding experiments with a soluble S protein comprising the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S fused to the Fc region of human IgG. (A) 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for soluble, Fc-tagged MERS-CoV S1 (solMERS-S1-Fc) and the indicated DPP4 variant containing a C-terminal cMYC-tag. Cells that were transfected only with empty expression vector alone, or empty expression vector instead of either solMERS-S1-Fc or DPP4 served as controls. At 48 h posttransduction, cells were lysed and incubated with protein A sepharose. Next, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. DPP4 levels were detected via antibodies specific for the cMYC-tag, whereas solMERS-S1-Fc was detected using a peroxidase-coupled anti-human antibody. Similar results were obtained in three individual experiments. Analysis of whole cell lysates (WCL) for expression of solMERS-S1-Fc, DPP4 and \u00df-actin confirmed comparable \u00df-actin levels in each sample and comparable expression levels for solMERS-S1-Fc and DPP4. (B) For quantification of MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction we first normalized the DPP4 signals against the respective solMERS-S1-Fc signals. Then, MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction was set as 100% for wildtype (WT) DPP4 and the relative interaction efficiency for each DPP4 mutant was calculated accordingly. Presented are the mean data from three independent experiments. Error bars indicate the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in MERS-CoV S/DPP4 interaction between WT and mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett\u2019s posttest (p > 0.05, ns; p \u2264 0.05, *; p \u2264 0.001, ***). (C) Soluble MERS-CoV S1-Fc was incubated with BHK-21 cells expressing wildtype (WT) or mutant DPP4, or cells transfected with empty expression vector or an ACE2-expression plasmid (controls). To detect bound S protein, the cells were subsequently incubated with an AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-human antibody directed against the Fc-tag. Fluorescent signals representing bound solMERS-S1-Fc were analyzed by flow cytometry and MFI values for each sample were calculated. For normalization, the MFI value of the negative control (empty expression vector) was subtracted from all samples. Further, binding of solMERS-S1-Fc to cells expressing DPP4 WT was set as 100% and the relative binding to cells expressing the DPP4 mutants was calculated accordingly. Shown are the combined data of five independent experiments with error bars indicating the SEM. Statistical significance of differences in solMERS-S1-Fc binding to cells expressing WT or mutant DPP4 was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett\u2019s posttest (p > 0.05, ns; p \u2264 0.05, *; p \u2264 0.01, **; p \u2264 0.001, ***).",
