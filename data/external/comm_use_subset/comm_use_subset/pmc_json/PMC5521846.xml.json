Pulmonary complications associated with falciparum malaria are estimated to occur in 9%\u201323% of cases, range from mild respiratory symptoms to pulmonary edema (PE) with or without ARDS; moreover, it usually presents in conjunction with cerebral malaria (CM), acute renal failure and high parasitemia [2\u20135]. In the lungs of CM patients, 51% of the blood vessels exhibited PRBC sequestration in septal capillaries and small blood vessels, which was significantly higher than in the lungs of non-CM patients [6]. Several mechanisms are considered to play an important role in acute lung injury and ARDS; however, one classical phenomenon involved is the disturbance of the pulmonary microcirculation by an occlusion with PRBCs. Such alterations result in a cascade of events, including cytokine overproduction, mononuclear cell and neutrophil activation through the initiation of ischemic hypoxia and blood gas barrier leakage, which are thought to be key events [7\u20139].",

            "text": "It has been well established that coagulopathy is closely related to the pathogenesis of malaria-associated acute lung injury [10\u201312]. The protein C system is an important natural anticoagulant mechanism mediated by activated protein C and its receptor, the EPCR, which regulates the activity of factors VIIIa and Va. In addition, it modulates endothelial dysfunction by blocking cytokine signalling, acts as an adhesion site of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1), controls vascular permeability, vascular protective signals and prevents the induction of apoptosis [13]. Recently, in children who have died of CM, the endothelial sites of adherent PRBCs have been demonstrated to colocalize with the loss of EPCR and thrombomodulin [14]. These findings indicate a disruption of the protective endothelial properties in the brain, linking coagulation and inflammation with PRBC sequestration. In addition, EPCR acts as the endothelial receptor for PfEMP-1[15, 16] and provides a parasitic binding site [16, 17]. Moreover, in Thai patients, it has been reported that there is an association between the EPCR-rs867186-G allele and protection from severe malaria [18]. However, whether the loss of the protein C system is related to localised coagulopathy in the lung and leads to ARDS in association with PE in the same manner presented as in CM [14, 16, 17, 19], remains unknown.",

The loss of type II pneumocyte and its integrity worsen the alveolar fluid transport disturbance and the reduction of surfactant production, therefore whole alveoli collapse or completely flood are consequently observed [20\u201322]. The scare observation of type II pneumocyte in malaria-associated ARDS patients is still unclear. Interestingly, based on the histopathological and electron microscopic results, a positive correlation between ARDS severity and the deposition of lung hemozoin was found in our cases. Moreover, a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been claimed to be involved in the pathogenesis of severe falciparum malaria (SM). Level of IL-31 and IL-33 were strongly elevated in SM patients, in contrast to IL-27, which was decreased in SM patients and increased in healthy subjects [23, 24].",

The study mainly focused on the clinical presentation and pulmonary histopathological changes related to ARDS with or without PE. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and electron microscopy studies were conducted. In addition, an in vitro model was used to assess the effect of hemozoin and interleukin (IL)-13, -27 and -31 on the lung epithelial cell line, A549. In particular, we sought to evaluate the effect of these cytokines and P. falciparum (Pf)-hemozoin on the integrity of the lung epithelium with an emphasis on apoptosis. Apoptotic pneumocytes were morphologically examined via electron microscopy and dual EB/AO staining. Real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) was used to determine the level of apoptosis regulator gene expression and caspase recruitment domain containing protein (CARD-9), as additional confirmation. The results of this study provided a new insight into the understanding of malaria-associated ARDS, with particular attention to underlying coagulative disorders and the effect of cytokines and hemozoin on cellular apoptosis.",

In addition, to demonstrate the pro-oxidative effect of hemozoin on pneumocytic cells, s-hemozoin (39404-00-7, InvivoGen, USA) was used. This synthetic crystal is commercially claimed that both size and physiochemical properties are similar to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) hemozoin [26]. In addition, it was synthesized by acidic method and described as a devoid of protein and DNA contamination. A549 were maintained in a complete cell culture medium composed of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated foetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (100 U/100 mg/mL) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The 104 cells/mL of A549 cells were seeded on a cover slip or transwell\u00ae polyester membrane in 12-well plates with 2 mL of culture medium until maturation. In addition, the cells were also seeded into 12-well plates without a cover slip or membrane. For the cytokine experiments, pneumocytes were then exposed to 500 ng/mL of rh IL-13, -27, -31, -13 plus -31 and -13 plus -27 plus -31 for a 1 h incubation. The decided dose of these ILs was obviously seen or easily differentiated the appearance of apoptotic and normal cells without adverse effect to the cells. Additionally, for the hemozoin experiment, the pneumocytes were exposed to 20 \u03bcM of s-hemozoin for 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h with camptothecin-induced apoptosis as a positive control. The selected concentration could observe the apoptotic effect of hemozoin on pneumocytic cell without other interference from non-specific effect. All cells on the coverslip and membrane were primarily fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in a 0.1 M sucrose phosphate buffer (SPB) (pH 7.4) for 1 h. The cells seeding onto the plate without a coverslip and membrane were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and then collected for apoptotic cell staining and real-time RT (reverse transcription)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

Briefly, when compared to normal cells (Fig 9A) with an intact nuclear and cytoplasmic membrane, early apoptotic cells were shown in green fluorescence with nuclear fragmentation or condensed chromatin (Fig 9B), cellular blebbing (Fig 9C) and cytoplasmic vacuolization (Fig 9D). Late apoptotic cells exhibited orange-red fluorescence with condensed chromatin (Fig 9E), whereas the necrotic cells were stained fluorescent red with an intact nucleus (Fig 9F). Similar to the EB/AO staining results, a higher level of CARD-9 was observed in the cells treated with hemozoin for 1, 6 and 12 h compared to the negative control with a similar pattern (Fig 9H). However, 24 h post-treatment, CARD-9 gene expression was diminished in both groups in contrast with the positive control. Interestingly, the ultrastructural analysis revealed that the A549 cells were predominantly pneumocyte type II cells, appeared to have phagocytic activity and ingested hemozoin pigment in our in vitro conditions (Fig 10). At 24 h post-culture, the apoptotic pneumocytes presented as detached cells separated from the membrane with cytoplasmic membrane blebling (Fig 10E).

            "text": "The present study found that malaria-associated ARDS was significantly associated with PE and systemic bleeding (Table 1). Moreover, a positive correlation between internal alveolar haemorrhage and the severity of ARDS was observed (Fig 1). Generally in SM, systemic bleeding is caused by a coagulation disturbance which consumes clotting factors and leads to severe bleeding in various tissues [10]. For this reason, several studies have focused on the correlation between coagulation abnormalities and SM. Interestingly, our results revealed that the severity of ARDS was dependent on the level of malarial pigment deposited in the lungs of SM patients (Fig 1). Therefore, our findings suggest that the alteration of the EPCR and TM in association with the deposition of s-hemozoin in the lung, including their interactions, may play a role in the pathogenesis of ARDS in SM.",

            "text": "Throughout the past decade, the protein C system had been considered a potentially important factor in the pathogenesis of SM. The early and preventive using of activated protein C as an adjunctive treatment for falciparum malaria and leptospirosis co-infection leads to improved clinical symptoms, particularly of lung injury, due to its anti-thrombotic, pro-fibrinolytic and anti-inflammatory properties [28]. Endothelial protein C reacts with parasitic materials from ruptured PRBCs and reduces their pro-inflammatory effects on endothelial cells [29]. Recently, PfEMP-1, the parasitic ligand on PRBCs infected with P. falciparum, has been shown to adhere to the EPCR on host cells and to interfere with the anti-coagulant and pro-endothelial barrier functions, which leads to activated coagulation, enhanced tumour necrosis factor (TNF) production and increased vascular permeability. All of these factors contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria [18, 30\u201332]. Our immunohistochemistry experiment revealed that a reduction of EPCR and TM was predominantly found in SM patients with ARDS (Figs 2 and 3). PE lungs also exhibited a lower expression of EPCR than those from non-PE and normal subjects, respectively. Fibrin was highly deposited inside the pulmonary vessels of SM patients with or without ARDS (Fig 6). There was a negative correlation between EPCR expression and the level of s-hemozoin, PRBC and WBC deposition in the lungs (Fig 2). Furthermore, ARDS lungs had a significantly higher level of ICAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1 expression than the non-ARDS lungs, whereas there was a similar level of ICAM-1 expression in both PE and non-PE lungs (Fig 4). SM patients with ARDS experienced a loss of EPCR and thrombomodulin expression in association with a high level of intravascular fibrin, hemozoin deposition, PRBC sequestration and inflammatory activation. In addition, the present study also indicated that the increase of ICAM-1 and TNF-\u03b1 expression was often found together with the decrease of TM in the lung. This relevance is in agreement with previous studies [33, 34] due to their antagonistic effect of ICAM-1, and TNF-\u03b1 and TM in term of the increment of vascular permeability and vascular protective property, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our report describes that the pathogenesis of ARDS is associated with the protein C system accompanied by hemozoin accumulation in the lung.",

            "text": "Cytokine activation is one of the main contributors of pathogenesis in SM affecting pulmonary epithelial and endothelial cells, leading to acute lung injury or ARDS. To predict severity in SM, chemokine and cytokine production may be useful for diagnosis and prognosis. As shown in the present study, a culture of IL-27 combined with IL-13 and IL-31 alleviated the number of apoptotic cells among the pneumocytes within 1 h when compared to those of each cytokine alone (Fig 8). The findings of the present study demonstrated that acute lung injury was related to circulatory pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines presented in SM. However the result also presented that IL-27 alone induced a high number of pneumocytic cell apoptosis. It is probably caused by some interaction between immune-modulatic role of IL-27 and carcinogenicity of A549 cell. In general, IL-27 modulates immunologic function that expresses by either proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects. In cancer cells, IL-27 can activate apoptosis via several pathways as presented in some reports [35, 36]. A549 cell is derived from adenocarcinoma origin. Because of its carcinogenicity, IL-27 may react to this cell as proinflammatory effect and lead to apoptosis.",

            "text": "It has been well established that the decrease in pulmonary surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes plays a crucial role in malaria-associated ARDS pathogenesis. In addition, another possible hypothesis is the multi-factorial nature of the pro-oxidative stress environment, including: [37] 1) the increase of polyunsaturated fatty acids due to the degradation of oxidative lipids; 2) proteolytic enzymes and pro-inflammatory cytokines from the host inflammatory responses [38, 39] and 3) the presence of hemozoin and haemoglobin degradation waste products from the parasite [40]. All of these factors may contribute to acute lung injury, including blood gas barrier leakage, haemorrhage and alveolar oedema. Consistent with previous reports in both experimental models [40, 41] and human cases [42], our results revealed that pulmonary hemozoin deposition was significantly increased in ARDS lungs in conjunction with PE and systemic bleeding (Table 1). Moreover, a positive correlation between the level of hemozoin and ARDS severity was observed (Fig 1H). Importantly, the results revealed that the deposited pigment also exhibited a negative correlation with the expression of EPCR in the lungs (Fig 2G), which was associated with the alteration of pulmonary epithelial integrity and vascular permeability. Therefore, the present study indicated that the level of hemozoin may be an important factor related to the occurrence of ARDS in patients with severe malaria.",

Concerning the onset of apoptosis, within 24 h post-exposure, s-hemozoin induced early apoptosis in pneumocytes as characterized by their staining patterns and morphological changes (Fig 9A\u20139G). In agreement with the mRNA expression of CARD-9, apoptosis was presented within 12 h post-exposure with an increasing trend (Fig 9H). Thus, it is suggested that in addition to the pro-inflammatory effects induced by hemozoin, alveolar epithelial cell damage was directly caused by s-hemozoin due to its pro-oxidative properties [40] via an apoptotic pathway. Recently, an in vitro study of P. falciparum, isolates demonstrated that apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial cells is sensitive to oxidative environments and requires direct contact between the parasite and host cells, otherwise PRBCs are sequestered alone [43]. Therefore, the oxidative properties of hemozoin may destroy the pulmonary epithelium and lead to acute lung injury.",

            "text": "Fas/FasL has been well described as pro-apoptotic signal, which is implicated in ARDS pathogenesis due to caspase activation [44, 45]. Interestingly, not only apoptotic genes those related to malaria-associated lung injury e.g. plasmodium apoptosis-linked pathogenicity factors (PALPF) [43] and caspase-3 and -8 [46, 47], Fas/FasL also contributes to both lung endothelium and epithelium damages leading to PE [47]. However, to date, there have been no reports of apoptotic-associated ARDS in severe falciparum malaria patients. The present study utilized an in vitro culture system to demonstrate lung epithelial cell damage and apoptosis in response to s-hemozoin as shown by CARD-9 expression. CARD-9 is the regulator of the apoptotic process through the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signalling [48]. This signalling modulates apoptosis in brain endothelial cell, leukocyte and hepatocyte in severe falciparum malaria patients [49, 50]. Consequently, it has a high possibility that CARD-9 involves in pulmonary apoptotic activity in severe malaria as seen in the brain and liver. Recently CARD-9 was also found to relate to the severity of lung injury leading to ARDS due to its activating effect on inflammatory responses [51, 52]. Therefore, the up-regulation of CARD-9 in pneumocytes treated with s-hemozoin may correspond with the level of lung injury due to apoptotic activity.",

            "text": "Several studies have reported that A549 cells exhibit phagocytic activity in association with host defence mechanisms such activity can be induced by foreign materials, fungi, or bacteria [53\u201355]. A transmission electron microscopic study revealed that A549 cells, predominantly pneumocyte type 2 cells, ingested s-hemozoin 24 h post-exposure in conjunction with the presence of injured cells undergoing apoptosis and necrosis (Fig 10). S-hemozoin was primarily internalised in A549 cells and located within the lamellar bodies, specialised vesicles for surfactant phospholipid deposition. However, the details of the phagocytic mechanism of these cells require further study. In addition, it has been well established that the source of vascular and pulmonary hemozoin in SM cases is the ruptured and mature PRBCs which are typically phagocytosed by neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages [6]. Our in vitro study proposed one more hypothesis, namely that the pneumocyte type 2 cells may interact with hemozoin and play an important role in the acute lung injury associated with SM as demonstrated by their phagocytic properties. However, our in vitro study had its own limitation, especially by the properties of s-hemozoin when compared to Pf-hemozoin from SM patients. S-hemozoin with acidic synthesis tends to be contaminated with DNA, depending on its purity of used hemin, and causes a huge consequence on the bio-cellular activities [56]. Moreover, a different type of hemozoin especially in size leads to their dissimilarity properties. As our observation, although the length of both types of hemozoin was similar, Pf-hemozoin had significantly wider than presented in s-hemozoin (Fig 11). Moreover, the shape of s-hemozoin presented in the pneumocyte seemed to be elongated crystalline, while a clumped form was mainly observed in Pf-hemozoin from malarial lung specimens. This kind of difference may affect on the level of cellular responses linking to the mimic ability of in vitro system to in vivo situation. To clarify this point, further studies need to be proven with better concerning of both size and purity of the used hemozoin.",

Therefore, the pulmonary resolution is blocked and the blood gas barrier is further disrupted and finally leads to an accumulation of fluid in the alveolar space accompanied by hyaline membrane formation.
