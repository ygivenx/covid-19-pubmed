Coronaviridae and Roniviridae belong to a group of \u201clarge-genome nidoviruses,\u201d as their genome lengths span 26.3 kb to 31.7 kb (1), whereas members of the Mesoniviridae have medium-sized (16-to-200-kb) genomes, between those of small- and large-genome nidoviruses (3, 4). Nevertheless, all nidoviruses are grouped together due to their similar replication/transcription strategies and their relatively close genetic relationship (1, 8).",

PRRSV is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which has become one of the most important infectious diseases in the swine industry and causes tremendous economic losses worldwide (9, 10). The PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in length, with 10 overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), and consists of both nonstructural genes (ORF1a and ORF1b) and structural genes (ORF2 to ORF7) (7, 11, 12). ORF1a and ORF1b comprise approximately 80% of the viral genome and encode at least 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), including nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, nsp2, nsp2TF/nsp2N, nsp3 to nsp6, nsp7\u03b1, nsp7\u03b2, and nsp8 to nsp12 (13); ORF2 to ORF7 encode the viral structural proteins GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, ORF5a, M, and N (14, 15). The resulting mature nsps direct viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription via a membrane-anchored replicase/transcriptase complex, and these mRNAs are then translated to produce structural and accessory proteins (12). nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and nsp10 (helicase) (7) are the key replicative enzymes in the replicase/transcriptase complex; nsp11 (endoribonuclease) may also play a key role in arterivirus replication, though the exact function of endoribonucleases in nidovirus replication remains unclear (7, 16).",

            "text": "PRRSV nsp11 possesses nidovirus uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) activity, which is important for arterivirus replication (2). XendoU, reported to be an endoribonuclease in eukaryotes, is involved in processing the intron-encoded box C/D U16 small nuclear RNA from its pre-mRNA (17). XendoU and NendoU, which specifically cleaves 5\u2032 uridine nucleotides of RNA substrates to generate a 2\u2032-3\u2032-cyclic phosphate end product, possess common functional characteristics (18\u201320). The endoribonuclease activity of coronavirus (CoV) nsp15 and arterivirus nsp11 has been confirmed (19\u201321), and recombinant arterivirus nsp11 displays broad substrate specificity in vitro (20). Moreover, the NendoU activity of coronavirus nsp15 is stimulated by Mn2+ (19, 21, 22), whereas Mn2+ was reported to be inhibitory to the activity of arterivirus nsp11 NendoU (20). The crystal structures of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp15 and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp15 show that the biological unit of nsp15 is a hexamer (19, 21) and that the N-terminal domain (NTD) is important for oligomerization (23). Although NendoU activity is common to nidoviruses (Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae), the NendoU domains exhibit considerable variation (20). There is no detailed structural information to date for arterivirus nsp11.",

Thus, to obtain wild-type nsp11, we assessed different expression vectors and used different E. coli strains as hosts; nevertheless, the yield of wild-type nsp11 remained extremely low. Indeed, our experimental results showed that wild-type nsp11 causes cell cytotoxicity and death after an extended expression time (approximately 3 h). The duration of wild-type nsp11 expression was examined at different times (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, and 90 min) at 37\u00b0C, with 60 min found to be the best expression time (data not shown). The yields of wild-type nsp11 from the expression vectors [pET-42b (+) and pET-30a (+)] were estimated to be approximately 0.05 mg and 0.2 mg of protein, respectively, per liter of bacterial cell culture. In contrast, the yield of mutant protein reached approximately 5 to 6 mg/liter (37\u00b0C, 5 h). Previous studies indicated that functional endoribonucleases can cleave the 3\u2032 terminus of the pyrimidines of ssRNA and dsRNA substrates (18, 20), which might act on both their own and cellular mRNA and cause NendoU expression to be potentially \u201csuicidal\u201d (7).",

The Matthews coefficient and solvent content are 2.99 and 58%, respectively, as determined by cell content analysis. The solvent content value is high, which may explain why the diffraction of the crystals was poor. The crystal belongs to the space group P41212 and consists of two subunits in an asymmetric unit (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, subunit A is visibly different from subunit B (Fig. 1C, D, and E). In subunit B, residues in the regions Asp134-Gly141, Ser166-Lys173, and Leu222-Glu223 could not be traced due to a lack of interpretable electron density (Fig. 1C). The crystal structure can be divided into two major parts: the N-terminal domain (NTD; Gly1 to Phe90) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (Arg107 to Glu223). The NTD is formed by six \u03b2-strands (\u03b21 to \u03b26) and two \u03b1-helices (\u03b11 to \u03b12) and is connected to the catalytic domain through a linker domain (LKD; Val91 to Thr106). The catalytic domain has a typical fold consisting of a compact groove region containing sequentially connected left and right parts (Fig. 1A): the left part of the catalytic domain consists of two \u03b1-helices (\u03b13 and \u03b14) and six \u03b2-strands (\u03b27 to \u03b212), and the right part is formed by three antiparallel \u03b2-strands (\u03b213 to \u03b215) and one \u03b1-helix (\u03b15).

Our data indicated that nsp11 eluted primarily in one peak; the calculated molecular mass is approximately 58.9 kDa, which corresponds to a dimer (Fig. 2C, D, and E). This finding is consistent with the dimeric crystal structure of nsp11 (Fig. 1B). The dimerization interface is shown in Fig. 2A and B. Residues Gly1, Leu54, Arg55, Tyr69, Ser74, Phe76, Gly137, Gly138, Arg153, Val165, and Ser166 were chosen as candidate targets to abolish the dimerization. The mutant (G1A, L54A, R55A, Y69A, G137A, G138A, V165A, and S166A) proteins eluted as a dimer; these mutations could not prevent nsp11 dimerization (data not shown). However, elution of the mutant (S74A and F76A) proteins by gel filtration yielded two 280-nm absorption peaks (Fig. 2D and E). Our results indicated that these two mutations significantly disrupt the dimerization in solution. Moreover, the R153A mutant existed mainly as an intermediate form (the calculated molecular mass is approximately 48.8 kDa) compared with the wild type (Fig. 2D and E). Meanwhile, the oligomerization of wild-type and mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) nsp11 proteins was further analyzed via sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and the results were shown in Fig. 2F and G. The molecular weights of monomers and dimers from the wild-type nsp11 protein are approximately 29.2 (approximately 14.04% of the total population) and 63.7 (approximately 86.67%) and are essentially consistent with those of gel filtration chromatography. The sedimentation coefficient (S20,W) of the mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) proteins decreased significantly compared with the wild type, though the relative populations of monomers and dimers of those mutant proteins were not successfully determined. This indicated that the oligomerization of the mutant proteins had markedly changed. Therefore, our biochemical data consistently showed that nsp11 exists mainly as a dimer in solution and that the mutations in the dimerization interface, S74A, F76A, and R153A, disrupt dimerization.",

Regardless, this smaller binding surface may be sufficient to stabilize monomer-monomer interactions because the molecular weight of nsp11 (approximately 25.6) is lower than that of SARS-CoV nsp15 (approximately 38.5). In addition, the catalytic domain of subunit A and the NTD of subunit B are associated with a largely hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding network (Fig. 2A and B). A total of 16 residues in the NTD of subunit B interact with 17 residues in the catalytic domain of subunit A. Residue Phe76 interacts with residues Tyr150, Leu151, Pro152, Gly164, Val165, and Ser166 via the hydrophobic forces (Fig. 2A and B); thus, Phe76 is a key residue within the dimer interface. Moreover, residue Ser74 interacts with residues Pro152, Val163, and Gly164 and is thus also a key residue within the dimer interface (Fig. 2A and B). In addition, interactional residues Leu77, Val110, and Cys112 were also observed with residue Arg153 (Fig. 2A and B). Therefore, these mutations (S74A, F76A, and R153A) may disturb both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between monomers and prevent the formation of stable dimers.",

As predicted, the activity levels of the mutants (S74A and F76A) were significantly decreased (being at least 4-fold less than wild-type levels) but not completely abolished (see Fig. 7C) because the mutant proteins were not purely monomeric. In addition, gel filtration chromatography revealed that the 280-nm absorption peak of the mutant S74A protein was obviously lower than that of the mutant F76A protein with the same amount of total protein (Fig. 2D and E), which indicated that the mutant S74A protein is very unstable. This may be the reason why the NendoU activity of the S74A mutant is lower than that of the F76A mutant. In conclusion, the S74A and F76A mutations severely diminished the catalytic activity, indicating that the dimer is the biologically functional unit.",

In analogy with the monomer structure of SARS-CoV nsp15, the loops consisting of residues His129 to His144 and Val162 to Thr179 are identified as the \u201cactive site loop\u201d and \u201csupporting loop,\u201d respectively (23). In the dimeric architecture of nsp11, the active site loop and supporting loop from subunit A are packed against one another, and their structures are stabilized by monomer-monomer interactions with subunit B (Fig. 3A). However, the electron density of these loops is missing in subunit B, indicating that they are flexibly disordered. Furthermore, interactions among residues Val135, Thr138 to Val140, Cys143, and His144 in the active site loop and residues Val165, Ser167, Lys170, Ala171, Lys173, and Cys176 to Thr179 in the supporting loop are observed in the structure (Fig. 3B). These extensive interactions between the supporting loop and the adjacent monomer were analyzed. Residues Val163 to Ser166, Pro168, Gly169, and Lys170 to Ala174 from the supporting loop interact with residues Gly1 to Ser3, Leu54, Tyr69, Val71 to Ser74, Phe76, Val82, and Val83 of the adjacent monomer (Fig. 3B), indicating that the supporting loop is involved in dimerization. Therefore, the disappearance of these two loops from subunit B may be attributed to the absence of the adjacent monomer. This finding may explain why nsp11 is fully active as a dimer. Interestingly, the potential link between dimerization and catalytic activity is similar to the mechanism of the functional hexamer of SARS-CoV nsp15 (23). In addition, further research is needed to explore whether the dimer or other oligomers of nsp11 exist in a functional state during arterivirus replication.",

In this study, endoribonuclease activity of the wild-type and mutant nsp11 protein was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 7C. Enzyme activity assays for the wild-type and H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A mutant proteins were performed under identical conditions, and the activity levels of the mutants were significantly reduced compared with the wild-type level (Fig. 7C), indicating that these residues are located in important NendoU active sites.",

            "text": "Previous results suggested that the catalytic mechanism of the nidovirus endoribonuclease could be consistent with an RNase A-like reaction mechanism that cleaves the RNA substrate to form a 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphodiester and a 3\u2032-phosphomonoester by transphosphorylation and hydrolysis (20). The catalytic His129 and His144 residues of nsp11 (corresponding to His234 and His249 of SARS-CoV nsp15) are thought to accept and donate protons during production of the 2\u2032-3\u2032-cyclic phosphate (19), which may explain why the catalytic activity of the H129A mutant is much lower than that of the K173A mutant. Previous studies also demonstrated that residues His129, His144, and Lys173 (corresponding to His234/His262, His249/His277, and Lys289/Lys317 in SARS-CoV nsp15 and MHV nsp15, respectively) are essential for endoribonuclease activity in coronaviruses and arteriviruses (19\u201322, 35). In our crystal structure, these three putative catalytic residues (His129, His144, and Lys173) surround a positively charged cavity in the catalytic domain, with Thr177 located in the middle of the groove (Fig. 7A). Thr177 (corresponding to Ser293 and Thr321 in SARS-CoV nsp15 and MHV nsp15, respectively) could also be important for substrate recognition and binding (19, 36, 37). Moreover, Tyr219 (corresponding to Tyr342 in SARS-CoV nsp15) has been implicated in the orientation and binding of the substrate (19, 36). As predicted, the catalytic activity levels of the T177A and Y219A mutants were significantly decreased but not completely abolished.",

            "text": "In addition, previous studies reported that the endoribonuclease activity of PRRSV nsp11 is essential to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 induction (38). We found that the overexpression of wild-type nsp11 markedly inhibited the activity of the IFN-\u03b2 luciferase reporter induced by Sendai virus (SEV), while the mutants (S74A, S76A, H129A, K173A, T177A, and Y219A) lost the capacity to block the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Fig. 8A and B). Because the recombinant arterivirus nsp11 protein displays broad substrate specificity in vitro and is extremely toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (20), it is possible that the suppression of IFN-\u03b2 induction by wild-type nsp11 is due to its cytotoxicity. HEK293T cells expressing wild-type nsp11 appeared to be in good shape and showed no obvious cytotoxicity in detection experiments performed with the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Fig. 8E and F). However, when we analyzed the ability of wild-type and mutant nsp11 to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 induction by the use of a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), we found that the value for pRL-TK, an internal control reporter, was significantly lower in cells expressing wild-type nsp11 than in cells expressing nsp11 mutants or in cells that had received mock treatment (Fig. 8C), indicating that wild-type nsp11 inhibits host gene expression. Coincidentally, none of the tested nsp11 mutants without cytotoxicity significantly inhibited IFN-\u03b2 induction (Fig. 8A, B, and C). Therefore, we could not exclude the possibility that the potential cytotoxicity of wild-type nsp11 inhibits IFN-\u03b2 induction. It should be noted that this study involved the individual expression of nsp11, outside the context of infection. Whether the endoribonuclease function of nsp11 specifically contributes to the decline of innate immune functions in PRRSV infection requires further investigation.",

Our biochemical data showed that mutation of key residues (Ser74 and Phe76) in the dimerization interface disrupts dimerization in solution and markedly impairs the endoribonuclease activity in vitro. Furthermore, structural analyses showed that the absence of adjacent monomer interactions might damage the structural stability of the catalytic domain, which indicates why the biologically active unit of nsp11 is a dimer. Furthermore, structural conservation of the catalytic domain in members of the order Nidovirales (families Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) was also observed in this study. These results provide a model that will contribute to an understanding of the structure-function relationship of endoribonucleases in the order Nidovirales, and our findings will serve as a structural basis for the development of new nsp11-specific antiviral drugs and other inhibitors.",
