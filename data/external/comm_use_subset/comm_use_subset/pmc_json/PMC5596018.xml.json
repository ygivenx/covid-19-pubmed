            "text": "The innate immunity of host cells is the first line of defense that initiates a protective response against pathogenic microorganisms and viruses1. Germline-encoded receptors of the innate immune system protect the host cells from infection by pathogenic intruders2, while pathogens constantly evolve various strategies to circumvent the host\u2019s protective responses3. Host cells are equipped with counter mechanisms to detect virus-encoded molecular patterns and propagate an antiviral response. Viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a well-characterized pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognized by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), resulting in type 1 interferon (IFN1) production4. Viruses employ a unique evasion mechanism by synthesizing proteins that hinder the IFN1 production and secretion pathways. For instance, influenza A virus uses non-structural protein 1 to bind dsRNA5, inhibiting RIG-1-like receptors and TLR3-dependent IFN1 synthesis. Dengue virus, on the other hand, prevents IRF3 phosphorylation through the non-structural protein 2B3 protease complex6. Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) implements a mechanism to evade dsRNA sensors including RIG-1, MDA5, and endosomal TLR3 of the host immune system. Subsequent studies have found that MERS-CoV is much more sensitive to IFN1 treatment than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)7\u201310. This viral interference in the host innate immune pathway enhances virus-induced disease progression and elevates the mortality rate to 60%11, 12.",

The natural habitat of the virus is not known; however, phylogenetic analyses show that bat coronaviruses bCoV-HKU4 and bCoV-HKU5 are the closest neighbors to MERS-CoV, suggesting that the virus can be spread by bats14. The genome organization of MERS-CoV is similar to SARS-CoV, in which non-structural proteins responsible for genome replication cover two-thirds of the genome. The remaining parts of the genome encode structural (membrane, spike, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins) and accessory proteins15, 16. Once MERS-CoV enters the cells with the help of dipeptidyl peptidase\u20134 receptors17, it starts replicating by manipulating and modulating the host cells\u2019 metabolism18, including antigen presentation, apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and innate immune response. MERS-CoV interrupts IFN1 response of the cell and may encode certain proteins that help the virus to escape from the host immune system. The accessory proteins 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b, encoded by various open reading frames, inhibit IFN1 production in the infected cells, mainly in dendritic cells19.",

Mutational studies have shown that two amino acids, K63 and K67, in the p4a-DRSM play crucial role in RNA association and p4a-dsRNA complex stability22.

In addition, only 3D atomic level structures can suggest plausible druggability of viral proteins. However, in this particular case, a high-resolution 3D structure of MERS-CoV p4a, alone or bound to dsRNA, is not available. Thus, p4a-DSRM, containing 72 amino acid residues, was modeled and investigated for its structural stability. 1YYK34, the crystal structure of Aquifex aeolicus dsRNA binding protein, was used as a template, with a TM-score of 0.7577 suggested by Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER) modeling server, to build p4a model. The sequence alignment of p4a with 1YYK shows a satisfactory normalized Z score of 1.27 (a normalized Z score > 1 is considered as a good score). The pairwise sequence alignment obtained from the T-COFFEE server also showed a satisfactory score of 76 (Fig. 1a). After the validation of structures obtained from different servers and tools (Supplementary Table S1), the 3D structure obtained from I-TASSER was selected as the best model for further studies. The 3D structure validation and protein geometry results were found to be satisfactory, as provided by the ProSA web server. Thr19, Tyr22, and Ala50, located in loop regions, were found to be outside of the core region in the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 1b). However, an overall ERRAT quality factor and Z-score values, calculated using ProSA-web, were found to be satisfactory (Supplementary Table S1). The obtained structure of p4a-DSRM exhibited a typical dsRBD structure that adopts an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 fold (Fig. 1c). This particular folded structure has been endowed with the ability to recognize and bind to dsRNA35. To validate the arrangement of the secondary structural elements, the modeled protein was compared with the predicted secondary structure. MERS-CoV p4a consists of 33% helix, 33% strands, and 34% coils. In the model, the helices \u03b11 and \u03b12 span from residue positions 3 to 13 and 61 to 71, while \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23 span from residues 27 to 34, 42 to 48, and 53 to 58, respectively (Fig. 1d).\n",

The binding free energy difference between a given residue and an alanine substitution suggests the significance of that particular residue in complex stability. The involvement of a particular amino acid, in terms of energy, in the p4a-dsRNA complex can be calculated in the form of relative binding affinity (dAffinity) and relative thermostability (dStability) by the protein design tool of molecular operating environment (MOE) program (Table 2). Positive dAffinity values indicate that the RNA-binding affinity of p4a is reduced if a particular residue is mutated to alanine and vice versa. Similarly, mutants with positive dStability scores show less stable mutations. This suggests that native-to-alanine mutants with positive and high dAffinity and dStability values are hotspots and play a vital role in p4a-dsRNA complex formation (Supplementary Table S2). To validate this, we used the I-Mutant 2.0 web server, which generated similar results (Table 2). The residues were labeled as hot, warm, and null based on the free energy value differences38. Residues with a change in free energy value (\u0394\u0394G) less than 0.5 kcal/mol were assigned as null or unimportant residues. Those having values between 0.5 and 1.5 kcal/mol were assigned as warm residues and those with values more than 1.5 kcal/mol were assigned as hotspot residues. \u0394\u0394Gbinding represents the difference between the binding energy of p4a mutants and wild type, at a particular position.\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{\\rm{\\Delta }}{\\rm{\\Delta }}{\\rm{G}}}^{{\\rm{binding}}}={\\rm{\\Delta }}{\\rm{G}}\\,{{\\rm{binding}}}^{{\\rm{MUT}}}-\\,{\\rm{\\Delta }}{\\rm{G}}\\,{{\\rm{binding}}}^{{\\rm{WT}}}$$\\end{document}\u0394\u0394Gbinding=\u0394GbindingMUT\u2212\u0394GbindingWT\n\n",

The backbone RMSD of all complexes exhibited variable behavior during the 200 ns MD simulations (Fig. 2b\u2013f).

The wild type complex showed greater fluctuations between residues 10 and 20 (part of the \u03b11 helix region), while the rest of the residues were quite steady during the MD simulation (Fig. 3a). However, the mutant complexes displayed local fluctuations at various positions (Fig. 3b\u2013f). A closer analysis revealed that all p4a-mutants (except K27A) had distinct RMSF peaks between residues 10 and 20 and they contained few additional peaks that did not occur in the wild type complex. Therefore, the stability of specific residues during the MD simulation might be dependent on their interactions with the original residues that were mutated to alanine. Interestingly, the substitutions N8A, K27A, W45A, and K67A resulted in an increased fluctuation between residues 30 and 40 (the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop region), while K63A was relatively stable at this position (Fig. 3b\u2013f), which is consistent with the RMSD observation. This \u03b21-\u03b22 loop plays a crucial role in identifying the minor groove in dsRNA. In N8A (Fig. 3e), the loop residues spanning from 13 to 26 and 31 to 42 showed larger RMSF peaks, whereas, in W45A (Fig. 3f), the \u03b11 helix residues spanning from 3 to 12 displayed high fluctuations. These findings suggest that mutating these residues might not have any direct effect on p4a-dsRNA binding; however, they may distantly affect the stability of other residues that are vital in the interaction.\n",

In order to understand the effect of alanine mutations on the interaction of p4a with dsRNA, we performed a comparative analysis of intermolecular hydrogen bond (h-bond) patterns before and after the 200 ns MD simulations (Fig. 4). Analysis of h-bonds formed between dsRNA and wild type p4a revealed that the hotspot residues K27, K63, K67, N8, and W45 make h-bonds with dsRNA. Time-dependent calculations of interaction distances revealed that K67, K63, K27, and W45 had consistent interactions with dsRNA during the MD simulations (Supplementary Fig. S5a). Mutating these residues substantially affected the intermolecular h-bond numbers between p4a and dsRNA. The N8A and W45A variants surprisingly reduced this number from 12 (wild type) to ~7 (mutants) (Fig. 4f and g; Supplementary Fig. S5b). The K67A variant also exhibited a reduction trend in h-bond numbers, similar to that observed in the N8A and W45A variants. The decrease in the h-bond number in the mutants W45A and N8A highlight the importance of these residues in the binding of dsRNA and p4a. Both h-bond numbers and RMSF values indicate that mutations at these three positions have a distant effect on loop 2 located between \u03b21 and \u03b22 strands.\n",

Different patterns of correlated motions were observed in all mutant complexes compared to wild type complexes. However, the difference in the correlation of atomic displacements was prominent in K27A, while K63A presented a smaller number of correlated motions. Wild type and K63A showed a similar behavior for correlated displacements, while N8A and K67A showed negatively correlated displacements (Fig. 6). W45A displayed weak, negatively correlated motions at residues 35 to 72; however, it showed partial correlations among the residues before 35. In the wild type complex, helix \u03b11 of K67A and N8A had highly correlated movements. The movement of loop 2 varied among different complexes, which agrees with the corresponding RMSF (Fig. 3) and porcupine plot data (Fig. 5). In the wild type, the atomic displacement was not correlated initially, but later it indicated slightly negatively correlated motions as the simulation progressed. In all other complexes, loop 2 revealed negatively correlated movements except for a few residues having minor correlated displacements. Helix \u03b12 depicted similar correlated movements in all complexes except for the wild type complex. In short, all mutants exhibited different correlated motions than did the wild type complex, where most of the residues showed negative correlations except for those of helix \u03b12.\n",

Structural coordinates were extracted from the low energy states to understand structural evolution. In Fig. 7, black color represents the lowest Gibbs energy states, while the numbers represent the positions of the structural coordinates sampled from that locus on the FEL plot. The occurrence time of these coordinates was then tracked and marked on the RMSD plots of the respective variants (Fig. 2). The FEL plot showed that the wild type attained three different energy states (two metastable and one native) separated by high-energy barriers; however, it remained in one energy state for most of the time (Fig. 7a). The experimentally reported mutant K63A remained in one dominant native state and did not show a transition to any other native or metastable state during the entire simulation (Fig. 7c). This was also recorded in the backbone RMSD plot, where K63A remained stable throughout its MD trajectory (Fig. 2c). The PDB coordinates, obtained from four different points at the lowest energy state of the FEL plot, corresponded to multiple points between 116\u2013200 ns on the RMSD plot. Other variants, however, exhibited different behavior on the FEL plots and different Gibbs energies. N8A and K27A visited multiple metastable states during their structural evolution in MD simulations and were separated by low- and high-energy barriers, respectively (Fig. 7b, and e). The K27A variant, however, exhibited a clear transition from one state to another energy state. Interestingly, the same transition trend was observed in its backbone RMSD plot, where the K27A complex remained stable until ~130 ns of the MD run; its RMSD then suddenly increased and started fluctuating relatively high, as compared to the first 130 ns, for the last 50 ns (Fig. 2b). The W45A and N8A variants exhibited similar behavior; however, the W45A plot was less diffused and the states were separated by lower-energy barriers compared to N8A. The FEL map depicted that the second experimentally reported variant K67A stayed at one native state during the entire simulation; nonetheless, this energy state was more diffused and broader than the K63A variant (Fig. 7d).\n",

The positively charged residues K27, K63, and K67 on the surface seem to be highly crucial for dsRNA recognition. These sites could be further investigated through site-directed mutagenesis to unveil their cumulative and individual roles in dsRNA recognition that helps the virus to escape the immune response.

As mentioned earlier, p4a contains a dsRBD23. Our protein model also suggested that p4a exhibited a well-folded structure acquiring a typical \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 pattern (Fig. 1c) and docking analysis showed that p4a recognizes dsRNA in a shape-specific manner by establishing contacts with its major and minor grooves. Similar results have also been reported previously, where adenosine deaminase RNA specific 2 (ADAR2) recognizes stem loop mRNA39. ADAR2 is an RNA transcript-editing enzyme that uses a reaction known as hydrolytic deamination. Previous studies reported that two conserved lysine residues at positions 63 and 67 are vital for the p4a-dsRNA interaction. Mutating these residues render p4a incapable of blocking IFN production in MERS-CoV-infected cells22. Interestingly, we found that these residues retained their contacts with dsRNA after subjecting the p4a-dsRNA wild type complex to 200 ns MD simulations. These preliminary findings support the results of previous studies and further suggest that other amino acid residues play a crucial role in p4a-dsRNA interaction and could be helpful in blocking p4a activity. To examine the role of each residue present at the interface of p4a and dsRNA, computational alanine scanning was used. In addition to the previously reported residues, K63 and K67, we found three more residues, N8, K27, and W45, that could disrupt the p4a-dsRNA interaction. A rigorous computational analysis was performed to pinpoint the role of these newly identified hotspot residues, using MD simulations and free energy calculations. An overall trajectory analysis through RMSD, RMSF, and essential dynamics revealed that the newly created variants displayed few variations in the 3D structure that might affect their affinity toward dsRNA. Interestingly, of the two experimentally reported variants, K63A showed a lower structural instability than did K67A when compared to the others (Figs 2 and 4). This indicates that the loss of the dsRNA binding strength in this mutant may require a different explanation. However, K67A showed marked deviations in RMSD, RMSF, and domain motions. All of the newly constructed alanine variants demonstrated a discrete pattern of structural dynamics, which is interesting because all of them had the same starting 3D configurations except for a single residue substitution. This is because the substitution of a single amino acid with alanine is sufficient to cause differential protein dynamics affecting ligand-binding capability in simulated or natural conditions.",

The strength of the p4a-dsRNA interaction was lost in the W45A mutant, which showed that residue W45 might play an important role in the binding of p4a to dsRNA. Further computational analysis showed that mutants W45A and K27A, other than the experimentally reported mutants, led to an excess loss of binding affinity. In this work, MD simulations were performed to understand the dsRNA-p4a binding mechanism and to reveal the important residues, which play a key role in binding. The wild type and mutant structures were stable during the 200 ns of the simulations but the average RMSD of mutant W45A was above 3 \u00c5. Similarly, in W45A, the number of h-bonds constantly decreased with the MD trajectory over 200 ns. A significant decrease in the binding affinity calculations suggests that W45A and K27A are important for dsRNA and p4a binding, which can be targeted to block their interaction. These structural insights suggest that MERS-CoV p4a acquires a defined DSRM fold and recognizes dsRNA in a shape-dependent manner. The \u03b11 helix and loop 2 are crucial for dsRNA recognition and establishing contacts with the minor grooves of dsRNA.

To model the p4a DSRM, a template structure was searched against a PDB40, 41 by BLAST and through the threading-based modeling server, I-TASSER. The template structures selected by BLAST and the I-TASSER server included the dsRNA binding proteins, 1YYK, 2L3J, and 1DI2. Most of these structures were resolved through NMR or X-ray diffraction studies in the presence of RNA duplexes or hairpins (synthetic or natural). T-COFFEE version 11.0 was used for pairwise alignment of 1YYK (template) and the p4a sequence. Initially, Modeller42, 43 was used to build the protein model. Also, four other online tools including I-TASSER44, PHYRE45, Swiss model46, and CPH model47 were used for comparative analysis and validation of the protein models. The best model was selected based on the minimum violation of atomic contacts and maximum score criteria. The quality and accuracy of the built model was further evaluated and validated using a Ramachandran plot48, QMEAN49, and ProSA50. Energy minimization was performed for model refinement and quality improvement using UCSF Chimera51. To add charges on standard amino acids, AMBER ff99SB force field was used while AM1BCC force field was applied to other residues. The steepest descent minimization steps were set to 100, whereas the conjugate gradient was set to 10 with a step size of 0.02 \u00c5. The secondary structure of the modeled protein was validated using Protein Structure Validation Suite (PSVS)52 and Protein Structure Evaluation Suite and Server (ProSESS)53. The secondary structure elements of the 3D model were compared with those of the predicted ones in order to measure the structural reliability. The selected p4a model was subjected to MD simulations to obtain a fully optimized and stable structure for further analysis (further discussed in the molecular dynamics section).",

The total charge of each system was neutralized by adding counter ions at the physiological concentration of 0.15 M salt. The long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle mesh Ewald algorithm60. The LINCS algorithm61 was applied to constrain bond lengths. The systems were energy-minimized using the steepest descent algorithm to remove steric clashes between atoms. The energy-minimized systems were simulated with NVT ensemble for 100 ps followed by NPT ensemble for 100 ps in order to equilibrate temperature and pressure, respectively. The temperature and pressure were coupled with V-rescale62 and Parrinello-Rahman barostat methods62, respectively. The production run was carried out for 200 ns without backbone restraints with a time step of 0.002 ns under the NPT condition.
