            "text": "Inflammation is a multicomponent response to injury, tissue stress, and infection, associated with most diseases, and it can occur in various tissues and organs of the organism [1]. Clinically, there are two main categories of anti-inflammatory drugs: steroidal drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Steroidal drugs generally refer to adrenocortical hormones, which have strong anti-inflammatory effect, but have obvious side effects such as water-sodium retention, puffiness, and osteoporosis [2]. And NSAID is one of the most widely used drugs in the world and are mainly classified into salicylates, propionic acids, indoles, fenamic acids, acetic acids and pyrazolones [3]. However, it has potential cardiovascular and gastrointestinal bleeding risks [4]. Due to the strong toxic and side effects of many synthetic drugs, and because traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the advantages of abundant resources, definite therapeutic effectiveness, and fewer side effects, the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory drugs from natural compounds has gradually become a research hotspot [5].",

Some pharmacological studies have showed that MC could inhibit the production of NO and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) induced by lipopolysaccharide/recombinant interferon-\u03b3 (LPS/rIFN-\u03b3) [8]. In animal experiments, MC could significantly decrease the level of cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), macrophage inflammatory peptide-2 (MIP-2), IL-6, and IL-10, which apparently inhibited LPS-induced acute lung injury in rat models [9]. Available evidence revealed that MC had the potential NF-\u03baB inhibitory activity and clinical anti-inflammatory efficacy; however, previous studies primarily focused on the single component, and the integral active components and their mechanisms of action have not yet been fully clear. Therefore, we mainly conducted a systematic study of the potential NF-\u03baB inhibitors in MC.",

However, the activated NF-\u03baB signaling pathway participates not only in immune regulation and inflammation, but also in infection, cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis [13\u201315]. If the activation cannot be eliminated in time, it may lead to serious pathological reactions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, septic shock, atherosclerosis, and cancer [16\u201318]. Consequently, inhibitors of NF-\u03baB activation are of primary significance in protecting cells from the potential damage of inflammation.",

Among them, gallic acid could inhibit NF-\u03baB activation by prevention of RelA acetylation [19]. And paeoniflorin could significantly inhibit NF-\u03baB by reducing the expression of the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and p65 [20]. Additionally, paeonol could suppress NF-\u03baB signaling through blocking MAPK/p38 signaling pathway [21, 22]. Furthermore, oxypaeoniflorin could inhibit the elevation of the expression levels of NF-\u03baB although the mechanism remained unclear [23]. Additionally, NF-\u03baB inhibitory activity of galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, and mudanoside C has not been reported in previous studies. In the present study, those three compounds could inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB induced by TNF-a and could be considered as novel NF-\u03baB inhibitors. In general, the efficacy of drugs depends mainly on their chemical structures [24]. According to our results, other monoterpenoids with paeoniflorin as the core structure may also have NF-\u03baB inhibitory activity, which can be used as a lead compound for the study of innovative drugs. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory activity of MC was related to the process of various components acting on multiple targets (Figure 5), which was consistent with the characteristics of TCMs with multiple components, multiple pathways, and multiple targets [25, 26].",
