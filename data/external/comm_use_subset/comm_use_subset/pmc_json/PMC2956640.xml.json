Rapid point-of-care diagnostics were insensitive for diagnosing the novel virus, and while existing molecular methods such as RT-PCR were able to detect influenza, they could not differentiate 2009 H1N1 from seasonal H3N2 or H1N1 infection [4]. Initial efforts to characterize the virus relied on traditional Sanger sequencing and the use of PCR primers to highly conserved regions in the influenza genome, methods that would likely have failed had the virus been more genetically divergent [1], [2]. No clinical or laboratory test was initially available to identify 2009 H1N1 with high sensitivity and specificity, and the virus may have circulated undetected in the human population for months [5]. Thus, there is a clear need for the introduction of broad-range viral detection methodologies into clinical and public health settings to deal with emerging threats such as 2009 H1N1 influenza.",

            "text": "Metagenomic approaches, including microarrays and deep sequencing, have proven increasingly successful in recent years for the diagnosis of infectious diseases by novel viral pathogens [6]. The Virochip is a pan-viral microarray that is designed to simultaneously detect all known viruses [7], [8]. Novel viral species or strains can also be detected on the basis of conserved sequence homology to known viruses, as demonstrated by the discovery of the SARS coronavirus by Virochip in 2003 [9], [10]. Other novel viruses previously identified by Virochip include a new clade of rhinoviruses [11], a human cardiovirus associated with respiratory and diarrheal illness [12], and avian bornavirus, the etiologic agent of outbreaks of proventricular dilation disease (PDD) in birds [13], [14]. For detection of known respiratory viruses, the Virochip microarray was found to have a sensitivity and specificity comparable to or superior to conventional diagnostic testing [11], [15]. Deep sequencing is a complementary approach capable of detecting viruses that are too divergent from known viruses to be detected by either PCR or microarray techniques [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]; reviewed in [6]. De novo pyrosequencing has enabled the discovery of two novel arenaviruses, an arenavirus associated with a fatal cluster of cases in solid-organ transplant patients (Dandenong virus) [22], and a hemorrhagic fever-associated arenavirus from South Africa (Lujo virus) [21].",

Seventeen samples from Mexico (n = 5), Canada (n = 9), and the United States (California) (n = 3) were suspected or PCR-confirmed cases of H1N1 infection. The remaining control samples, all from California, were positive for H1N1 seasonal influenza (n = 2), H3N2 seasonal influenza (n = 3), another respiratory virus (n = 6), or negative by all diagnostic testing (n = 1). Of note, the probes on the Virochip were designed prior to the emergence of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Virochip hybridization patterns corresponding to 15 of 17 samples suspected or confirmed positive for 2009 H1N1 grouped together by hierarchical cluster analysis, and were clearly distinguishable from patterns corresponding to seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (Fig. 2A). Two of the 17 samples, Mex-1225 and Mex-730, exhibited very weak microarray probe intensities on Virochip analysis and were grouped with the negative control samples. The finding of weak Virochip intensities for these two samples was reproducible, and likely secondary to low viral titers and/or high background from host nucleic acid which can interfere with the random PCR amplification step of Virochip analysis [8], [15]. The average normalized microarray intensities for the 2009 H1N1 samples were more pronounced with H1N1 probes derived from swine influenza (A/swine/Wisconsin/464/98) than with probes derived from human influenza (A/human/Puerto Rico/8/34); the difference was statistically significant for 13 of 17 samples by t-test analysis (Fig. 2B). Microarrays corresponding to seasonal H1N1 influenza displayed the opposite pattern, with H1N1 probes derived from human influenza stronger in intensity than those derived from swine influenza. Minimal cross-hybridization in influenza A probes was observed with samples either negative or harboring other respiratory viruses. The Virochip microarray was also analyzed using Z-score analysis and E-Predict, an automated method for viral species identification in microarrays [7], [35]. Both methods incorporate information from all of the oligonucleotide probes on the Virochip simultaneously, including probes to the full range of influenza strains, and revealed that a virus most similar to swine influenza A (A/swine/Wisconsin/464/98) was present in these samples (data not shown). Thus, the Virochip detected the presence of a virus most closely related to swine influenza A/H1N1 in samples from individuals infected with 2009 H1N1.",

Approximately 85% of reads from sample BC-59 aligned to bacterial sequences, mostly corresponding to the Streptococcus genus.

Given the high degree of conservation of rRNA sequences in bacteria, each read could only be unambiguously classified at the genus level (or at the family level in the case of Enterobactericeae) (Fig. 4). In general, a high level of diversity of bacterial families was observed in different samples, reflecting the known diversity of bacterial flora in the nasopharynx [37]. Reads to the top three bacterial families comprised anywhere from 22 to 97% of all bacterial reads, depending on the sample (Fig. 4A). Moraxellaceae or Enterobactericeae were the most common bacterial families found, accounting for one of the three most common bacterial families in 14 of 17 samples (Fig. 4B).

Since no RNA-seq data corresponding to nasopharyngeal samples from healthy individuals can be found in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.inh.gov/sra), we used a set of nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 11 Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) patients with influenza-like illness but testing negative for influenza as background controls.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in elucidating the cause of outbreaks from hitherto novel or unknown viruses, we generated a modified NT database from which all sequences corresponding to the Orthomyxoviridae family had been removed (Fig. 8A). Pure de novo assemblies of paired-end reads pooled from all 17 2009 H1N1 samples which did not align to the modified NT database were then constructed using Geneious software (Geneious, Auckland, NZ). Of the 582 final contigs (contiguous sequences) of length greater than 100 bp generated from the de novo assembly, 21 contigs mapped onto a reference sequence of 2009 H1N1 influenza, with an N50 contig size of 1,167 bp and coverage of 89.5% of the genome (Fig. 8B). The four longest contigs all corresponded to 2009 H1N1 and included the nearly full-length sequences of the PB1 (polymerase), NP (nucleoprotein) and NA (neuraminidase) segments (Fig. 8C). A cursory analysis of the remaining 561 contigs that did not map to the influenza genome revealed that \u223c90% of these sequences were low-complexity sequencing artifacts. From a similar analysis performed on the best single sample (BC-22), de novo assembly of 90.3% of the genome was possible. No misassemblies were observed even though the percentage of Orthomyxoviridae reads from all 17 H1N1 samples or BC-22 alone comprised only 7.6% or 2.6% of the corresponding unaligned reads to the modified NT database, respectively.",

The Virochip was capable of differentiating seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza from the novel 2009 pandemic strain by the use of multiple probes designed a priori, and accurately characterized the novel virus as closely related to swine influenza viruses. Complementary deep sequencing of 17 clinical samples collected early in the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic enabled detection of reads to the novel strain in every sample, as well as de novo assembly of \u223c90% of the genome amidst an enormous background of unaligned sequence reads. As with the SARS coronavirus, the lack of a broad-based diagnostic test that was sufficiently sensitive and specific likely contributed to the delayed identification of 2009 H1N1 as the cause of an initial outbreak of influenza-like illness in Mexico. Our approach \u2013 using the Virochip microarray for rapid screening and deep sequencing for de novo assembly and more detailed characterization \u2013 is robust, comprehensive, and directly applicable for the investigation of future outbreaks from novel viral pathogens, especially those which do not grow in culture.",

The longer reads from pyrosequencing (250\u2013450 bp) facilitate the assembly of individual reads into contigs, which assists in the classification of reads by homology-based BLAST alignments. Our results suggest, for example, that longer-read sequencing methods such as pyrosequencing may be better suited than Illumina sequencing for identification of bacteria. Accurate discrimination of bacteria at the species (or even genus) level was not possible with short 60-bp Illumina reads (Fig. 4B), as rRNA sequences corresponding to related bacteria were found to be essentially 100% identical over a 60-bp range. We did not de novo assemble the short Illumina reads aligning to bacterial rRNA into longer, more easily identifiable contigs given the known presence of multiple related bacterial species in the nasopharynx and the very high (and likely) risk of producing misassemblies. On the other hand, a key advantage of Illumina sequencing is the significant increase in read depth (\u223c100-fold) relative to pyrosequencing. The greater depth of sequencing provides better and more accurate genome coverage as well as increased capability to multiplex clinical samples.",

In addition, we were limited by the computational resources required for de novo assembly of \u223c11.5 million sequences in a reasonable amount of time. Our results demonstrate that a computational pipeline consisting of sequential alignments of individual reads using high-stringency cutoffs (Fig. 1), followed by de novo assembly of the remaining unaligned reads and detailed analysis of the resulting contigs (Fig. 8), is an efficient strategy for analyzing the large datasets generated by Illumina sequencing of clinical samples and for pathogen discovery. In particular, the final de novo assembly step is critical in identifying divergent sequences that may correspond to novel pathogens. The assembly of longer contigs also eases the burden of computationally intensive amino acid comparison algorithms such as BLASTX, TBLASTX and PHI-BLAST by reducing the number of sequences that need to be analyzed.",

In addition, unbiased deep sequencing allows broad-based detection of novel viruses that may elude diagnosis by specific RT-PCR assays. With paired-end read lengths achievable on the Illumina platform now approaching 300 bp, the use of deep sequencing for identification of even highly divergent pathogens at exceedingly low titers becomes feasible.",

Nakamura et al. also found >90% host genomic material in nasopharyngeal aspirates from influenza-infected individuals, and detected a similarly low percentage of reads to influenza, despite the use of centrifugation to remove bacterial and cellular material [32].

However, for this metagenomics study, we sought to mimic as closely as possible a clinical/public health laboratory setting, and such enrichment strategies may be labor-intensive and neither conducive to the demands of clinical laboratories nor practical given the limited amount of clinical sample available. In addition, an important drawback of directed viral purification methods is that by biasing the sample towards virus detection, they can severely hinder the ability to detect potential non-viral pathogens or investigate patterns of human gene expression in response to viral infection, as we have done here.",

Deep sequencing revealed that only five samples had a significant number of bacterial reads to the Streptococcus genus, which may either represent potential pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae), or simply normal human nasopharyngeal viral flora (e.g. Streptococcus oralis, sanguis, and/or mitis). One sample from a Canadian patient with an upper respiratory infection from 2009 H1N1 (BC-22) did contain a small number of reads from adenovirus type 4 (n = 26). These results imply that co-pathogens did not play a significant role in infection by 2009 H1N1 influenza in the 17 samples analyzed.

In addition, one sample (BC-22) contained a paired-end read of 97 nt that was a 98% match to the filovirus Ebola-Sudan. We considered this most likely a laboratory contaminant, since we did not identify any other reads to filoviruses and were unable to amplify additional filovirus sequence from BC-22. However, the origin of this sequence ultimately remains unknown, as we could not subsequently detect it in any sample or reagent by specific RT-PCR, and none of the laboratories involved in the analysis works with Ebola virus. We also found reads corresponding to plant viruses in two samples (BC-76 and Mex-1225). Detection of plant viruses in nasal swab samples is not unexpected given that the nasopharynx is contiguous with the oropharynx, and that an abundance of plant viruses of presumed dietary origin can be found in the human digestive tract [45]. Our discovery of unexpected viral reads corresponding to murine leukemia viruses, filoviruses, and plant viruses in the deep sequencing data underscores the challenges of analyzing rare or unique sequences that may correspond to colonizing flora, reagent/sample contamination, or even true pathogens.",

Interestingly, these 4 samples did not necessarily have a high number of transcriptome reads, but did have the highest 1X coverage of the influenza genome (Fig. 7B). Coverage of the influenza genome may be the best proxy measure for influenza activity and the associated host response in deep sequencing analysis, as it is relatively independent of PCR duplication artifacts that can be introduced during sample preparation for deep sequencing [46]. Our finding of increased expression of interferon-associated host genes in clinical samples from patients with 2009 H1N1 infection is intriguing and consistent with very recent data showing that the NS1 protein of 2009 H1N1 lacks the ability to block general host gene expression in both human and swine cells in vitro\n[47]. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of increased interferon-associated host gene expression in 2009 H1N1 infection in vivo. Nevertheless, this finding highlights the power of an unbiased deep sequencing approach by not only facilitating detection of the viral pathogen but also enabling elements of the host response to be simultaneously interrogated, thus generating new hypotheses for analysis of host-pathogen interactions.",

The PCR was performed using a Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in a 12.5 \u00b5l reaction containing 3.25 \u00b5l H2O, 2.5 \u00b5l 5X PCR buffer, 2.5 \u00b5l Q solution, 0.5 \u00b5l dNTP, 0.5 \u00b5l RT/Taq enzyme mix, 0.75 \u00b5l of each primer, 0.25 \u00b5l SYBR Green and 1.5 \u00b5l total RNA. Conditions for the PCR were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The viral titer was estimated using a standard curve derived from an in vitro-transcribed and quantified influenza mRNA standard (data not shown). For the Canadian samples, viral titers as determined through Ct values were compared with real-time RT-PCR data obtained independently from reference laboratories in Vancouver (BC-CDC) and Toronto (OAHPP) to check for accuracy (data not shown).",

BLASTN alignments to publicly available sequence databases were performed using four ExtraLarge High CPU-instance Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) servers comprising a total of 32 core processors, with an approximate computational time of 24 hours per sequencing lane. Sequence reads that aligned to human rRNA and mitochondrial genome by BLASTN (word size  = 11, E-value  = 1\u00d71010) were initially removed.

An ongoing metagenomic analysis of samples from 11 patients with KLS (\u201cKLS samples\u201d) by deep sequencing found only 24 reads to a single rhinovirus A isolate in one sample and no reads to influenza in any sample; in addition, all KLS samples were negative for both pandemic and seasonal influenza by specific RT-PCR (data not shown). As such, it was thought that the KLS samples could serve as appropriate background controls from individuals with influenza-like illness (but testing negative for influenza) for the purposes of transcriptomic analysis. In particular, the KLS samples were derived from a similar demographic as the H1N1 samples (children and young adults) and were processed identically for deep sequencing.",
