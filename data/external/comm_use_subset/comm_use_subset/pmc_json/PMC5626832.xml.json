The crucial factor in JEV-induced neuroinflammation is the uncontrolled activation of microglia, which release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (6, 7). The higher levels of proinflammatory mediators appear to commence an irreversible inflammatory response leading to neuronal death (4). Many studies have shown that microglia can be directly infected with JEV, and serves as long-lasting reservoir for JEV (8). Therefore, the activation of microglia is a key event during JEV-caused neuroinflammation. Previously, we have investigated various molecular mechanisms of JEV pathogenesis (9\u201312); however, further studies are still required to advance the understanding of JEV-induced neuroinflammation.",

            "text": "Recent advances have revealed that both mouse and human genomes contain a large number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes (13). lncRNAs have been implicated as regulators of diverse cellular processes such as regulation of cell cycle, chromatin structure, and RNA stability (14\u201316). However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs act are largely unknown. Recently, the transcriptomic analysis has revealed that a large number of lncRNAs were differentially expressed upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and enterovirus 71 (17, 18). Furthermore, several lncRNAs have been reported to be involved in virus replication. For instance, an lncRNA, NRAV, can regulate the replication of influenza A virus through inhibition of interferon-stimulating genes such as IFITM3 and MxA (19). Many lncRNAs have also been shown to modulate inflammatory response (20\u201323). Of these, Lethe, a pseudogene lncRNA, interacts with nuclear factor-kappa B to inhibit the binding of RelA with DNA and to suppress the activation of downstream signaling cascades (23). These findings suggest that lncRNAs play important roles in virus infection and inflammatory response. Thus, further efforts toward accurate annotation and functional significance of lncRNAs will be critical for our understanding of disease processes.",

Since JEV infection is associated with marked activation of glial cells and exorbitant release of inflammatory cytokines (39), we chose mouse microglial cells (BV2 cells) for further analysis. To determine whether BV2 cells were permissive to JEV, the successful infection of BV2 cells was verified by plaque assay (Figure 5A) and immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 5B). Next, we examined the expression levels of selected lncRNAs in JEV-infected BV2 cells by quantitative real-time PCR. Our results were concordant to those as observed in JEV-infected mice brain samples (Figure 5C). To examine whether lncRNA E52329 and N54010 are involved in JEV-mediated inflammatory process, the effect of these lncRNAs on the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production was determined. We analyzed the outcomes of silencing of these two lncRNAs using lncRNA-specific siRNAs in BV2 cells. First, we confirmed that the siRNAs significantly inhibited the expressions of lncRNAs in BV2 cells (Figure 6A). To determine the role of lncRNAs in inflammatory cytokine production, the cells were transfected with siE52329, siN54010 or non-specific control siRNA, and then infected with JEV. The results revealed that knockdown of these lncRNAs significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines at mRNA and protein levels (Figures 6B,C). Furthermore, we found that treatment of cells with siE52329 or siN54010 did not exhibit any effect on virus replication in JEV-infected BV2 cells, as viral titers were similar to those in control cells (Figure 6D). Furthermore, to examine whether these two lncRNAs are microglia specific, we selected another immune cell line (RAW264.7) as a control. The expression pattern of lncRNAs and the effects of lncRNAs-specific siRNAs on inflammatory cytokine production and virus replication were analogous to those observed in BV2 cells (Figures S4A\u2013D in Supplementary Material).

Therefore, we wondered whether the selected lncRNAs (E52329 and N54010) can regulate the MKK/JNK pathway. To validate it, we first examined the phosphorylation of MKK4 at Thr261 and JNK at Thr183 and Tyr185 in JEV-infected mouse brain samples (Figure 7B). Each of these phosphorylation events is associated with increased kinase activity (40, 41). To examine the role of lncRNA E52329 and N54010 in regulating the kinase activity of MKK4/JNK pathway, BV2 cells were transfected with siE52329, siN54010 or non-specific control siRNA, and then infected with JEV. Our findings showed that reduction of these lncRNAs significantly decreased the kinase activity of MKK4 and JNK after JEV infection at 6 and 12 h (Figures 7A,B). On the other hand, NF\u03baB is known as one of the key transcriptional factors of inflammatory cytokines in addition to AP-1 which can be activated by JNK. We also measured whether the lncRNA E52329 and N54010 can modify the NF\u03baB pathway. We found that the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, a direct inhibitor of NF\u03baB, was increased and I\u03baB\u03b1 protein was degraded upon JEV infection, but blocking the lncRNAs did not alter the phosphorylation level and protein amount of I\u03baB\u03b1 (Figures 7A,B). Thus, we consider that the selected lncRNAs may regulate JEV-induced inflammation through activation of MKK4/JNK pathway but not NF\u03baB pathway.",

Albeit, the precise functions of lncRNAs in virus-mediated pathogenesis remain poorly understood, evidence from recent studies indicates that lncRNAs may play a key role in virus-mediated inflammatory responses (19, 20). Herein, a transcriptomic profiling of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes from JEV-infected mice brain was performed using a microarray platform. The results of our study reveal the first experimental evidence demonstrating the complex regulation of lncRNAs by JEV infection in mice brain and microglial cells. The present study is unique from different angles. First, we used mice brain to understand the regulation of host lncRNAs upon JEV infection. This may provide us a way to elucidate the relationship between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in the brain, having the more complex biological system compare to cell culture system. Second, we validated our findings using microglial cells, which play important role in eliciting innate immune response during JEV infection (4). However, some of the lncRNAs were not detected in BV2 cells, which may associate with cell type specificity. Third, the integration of microarray platform, quantitative real-time PCR, GO analysis, pathways analysis, and lncRNA-mRNA coexpression network analysis has allowed us to conduct an active comparative genomics and bioinformatics study to reveal host lncRNAs expression patterns associated with JEV infection. We have identified a unique series of host molecular responses involving different combinatorial contributions of multiple cellular lncRNAs. This provides an opportunity to understand the unique cellular lncRNAs-mRNA interactome network, dynamically regulated by JEV infection. Since we confirmed our findings using microglia cell line, further validations using primary microglia remain to be done in future.",

            "text": "In order to understand the impact of global lncRNAs modulation during JEV infection, we further analyzed GO terms and cellular pathways that may have significance in JEV pathogenesis. We found that the most significant GOs associated with upregulated transcripts were related to innate immune response, inflammatory response, apoptotic process, acetylation, nucleotide binding, and defense response to virus infections; whereas the GOs terms associated with downregulated transcripts were mainly limited to ions transportation, cell adhesion, signal transduction, and synaptic transmission. Similarly, the most enriched upregulated pathways included Jak-STAT signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathways, and pathways related to Herpes simplex and influenza A viruses infection. In contrast, the most enriched downregulated pathways were related to calcium signaling, neuroactive ligand\u2013receptor signaling, and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. To find the potential key lncRNAs involved during JEV infection, we built the lncRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-lncRNAs coexpression networks. To verify the coexpression Network, we performed RNA pull-down experiments and found that three mRNAs Nod1, Tap2, and Col4a1can interact with indicated lncRNAs. Nod1 are known to play a remarkable role in host immune responses which can positively regulate JNK cascade, NF\u03baB activity (49). This may explain the fact of reduced production of inflammatory cytokines upon silencing of target genes. Our analysis revealed some important genes that may have their roles in regulating JEV-induced neuroinflammation. Considering the networks analyses and previous study, we speculated that the selected genes may trigger the MKK4/JNK and NF\u03baB pathway, and our experimental found the selected lncRNAs may activate MKK4/JNK pathway but not NF\u03baB pathway. The lncRNA E52329 and N54010 may also regulate other pathways to alter the JEV-mediated inflammation. However, we can not exclude all the other possibilities by experiments. We also compared our mRNA transcriptomic profile with a recent study revealing the dynamic changes in miRNAome and transcriptome in JEV-infected microglia (50). Of the 30 enlisted differentially expressed genes, 10 genes are also found to be differentially expressed in our study. Moreover, nine of 11 pathways predicted in referenced study are also analogous to our prediction analysis, thus, supporting our predictions.",

Using the bioinformatics tools, we found some important lncRNAs that may involve during JEV infection. Furthermore, our experimental data revealed the role of selected lncRNAs in regulating the kinase activity of MKK4 and JNK, which are considered to be involved in inflammatory pathway, and thus, confirmed our predictions. This study may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in JEV pathogenesis. Further studies are still required to understand the biological functions of these identified lncRNAs during JEV infection. As the roles of lncRNAs in viral infections have not yet been fully identified and understood, this study may also provide valuable resource for further studies.",
