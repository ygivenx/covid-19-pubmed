HPIV\u20104, while least well\u2010characterized, has been described as associated with both mild illness in children and lower respiratory tract disease.2 HPIV types have varying seasonality, prevalence, and clinical manifestations. In the United States, HPIV\u20101 usually occurs in the fall of odd numbered years, HPIV\u20102 occurs every fall, and HPIV\u20103 occurs in spring and summer.1, 3 The seasonality of HPIV\u20104 has not been as well defined, often due to its low prevalence.4 A recent study conducted in Colorado found a year\u2010round prevalence of HPIV\u20104 with peaks in the fall of odd numbered years.5 However, estimates of HPIV\u20104 prevalence are increasing, potentially due to improved and increased diagnostic testing, but few recent studies have assessed this.6, 7\n",

For this study, eligible households had 3 or more members with at least 1 member under 18 years of age, were Spanish\u2010 or English\u2010speaking, and had a cellular telephone with text messaging.8 Text messages were sent twice weekly inquiring about possible respiratory illness among household members. Nasal swabs were collected from ill participants by research staff if at least two of the following were reported to be present: fever/feverishness, runny nose/congestion, sore throat, cough, and/or myalgia. For infants, either runny nose or congestion prompted collection of a swab.",

Initial analyses showed interactions between HPIV type and age likely reflecting heterogeneous populations with different risk factors for severe illness.

The final models were created using a manual backward elimination method, keeping HPIV type included, and dropping the variable with the largest P\u2010value first until all other remaining variables were significant (P < 0.05).

The association of comorbid conditions and severe illness in those with HPIV is consistent with other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV and influenza, which both can exacerbate underlying cardiac and pulmonary conditions.12, 13, 14, 21, 22 This may also explain why 21% of hospitalized patients had a nonrespiratory primary diagnosis.",

The community cohort was 100% Hispanic/Latino, reducing the study's generalizability, and small, limiting our ability to find differences in severity of illness or symptomatology associated with HPIV types. Our hospital is a referral center and cares for many patients with underlying conditions. Furthermore, its referral status could impact accurate interpretation of \u201clocal\u201d epidemiology as only 32% of the hospitalized patients lived in the same zip codes as the MoSAIC study participants (M. Stockwell, personal communication). Testing of hospitalized patients relied on clinicians\u2019 judgement. We did not review radiographic findings or capture BiPAP use which may have biased assessment of severity of illness. The severity of illness score was developed for children and not previously tested in adults. Use of administrative data restricted our ability to assess patients\u2019 symptomatology. Although most patients had a respiratory diagnosis, we may have misclassified HPIV infections that actually represented prolonged HPIV shedding from previous illnesses. We did not classify positive bacterial cultures as consistent with infection vs. colonization vs. contamination.",
