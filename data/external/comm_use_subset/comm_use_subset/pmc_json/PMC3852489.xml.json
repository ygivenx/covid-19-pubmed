As of October 14, 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) had been informed of 138 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 60 deaths (a case fatality rate of 45%) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_10_14/en/). Recent reports of family clusters and health care-associated transmission of MERS-CoV through close contact have proven its capacity for human-to-human transmission [2]\u2013[5]. Although its transmissibility is significantly lower than that of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [6]\u2013[9], it may gain increased human-to-human transmissibility during its further evolution and potentially cause a pandemic in the future [10]. Accordingly, development of effective therapeutics and vaccines is critical for early intervention and prevention.",

            "text": "Unlike SARS-CoV, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor for binding to ACE2-expressing cells [11], MERS-CoV utilizes a different receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for binding to DPP4-expressing cells [12]. Like the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV, the S protein of MERS-CoV also plays important roles in virus entry and infection [13]. MERS-CoV S protein contains a S1 subunit that mediates virus binding to cells expressing DPP4 through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) region and an S2 subunit that mediates virus-cell membrane fusion [12], [13]. Based on sequence alignment and homology modeling analysis and functional studies, we and Mou et al. have predicted that the RBD is located in residues 377-662 or 358-588 of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [14]\u2013[16] (Fig. 1A). Co-crystallographic analyses of the RBD/DPP4 complexes have confirmed that the RBD is attributed to residues 367-606 or 367-588 in MERS-CoV S1 [17]\u2013[19] (Fig. 1A).",

(a 231-amino acid fragment spanning residues 358-588) could inhibit MERS-CoV infection at the 40 \u00b5g/ml level and elicit effective neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated rabbits [16]. These results suggest that the overlapping region (residues 377-588) must contain the receptor-binding motif (RBM) and the major neutralizing epitope of the RBD. Crystallographic analyses indicated that the RBM is located in the middle (residues 484-567) of the RBD [18], [19]. Therefore, we designed a 212-amino acid truncated RBD sequence (residues 377-588) (Fig. 1A) and tested its ability to inhibit MERS-CoV infection and induce neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice in order to identify a relatively optimized RBD sequence for developing anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines.",

We thus believe that a truncated RBD sequence spanning residues 377-588, which includes RBM (residues 484-567) [18], [19], may contain the major neutralizing epitope in RBD. Therefore, we expressed a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 fused with human IgG-Fc (S377-588-Fc) (Fig. 1A). We found that this protein could be highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells and purified to high purity. Its molecular weight under the non-boiled condition was almost 1-fold greater than that under boiled condition in 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1B), suggesting that S377-588-Fc formed a stable, dimeric structure under reducing condition.",

Mou et al. and our group have shown that the recombinant proteins containing residues 358-588 and 377-662, respectively, could induce MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in immunized animals [15], [16], suggesting that the overlapping region, which spans residues 377-588, must contain the major neutralizing epitope. Based on these findings, we designed a truncated RBD fragment containing residues 377-588, which contains the RBM (residues 484-567) of MERS-CoV S protein S1 subunit, and expressed a recombinant protein covering this region fused with Fc of human IgG. Fusion of Fc tag with S377-588 was carried out in order to 1) facilitate the affinity-purification of the Fc-containing fusion protein using protein A beads [20], [28]; 2) increase the immunogenicity of the Fc-containing protein [15], possibly through the binding of Fc in the protein to the Fc receptor (FcR) on the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [29]; and 3) increase the in vivo half-life and stability of the Fc-containing protein by the formation of stable dimeric or tetrameric conformational structure [30].",

These results suggest that the formation of dimer or tetramer by S377-588-Fc does not hinder the binding to its receptor DPP4.

Because of its potent inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV entry, the recombinant S377-588-Fc protein may be further developed as a MERS-CoV entry inhibitor for treatment of MERS-CoV infection in the acute stage. The major concern for use of protein drugs in clinics is their production of antibodies, which may suppress drug efficacy. However, this may not be a concern for the MERS-CoV S-RBD protein-based therapeutic. First, the human IgG Fc in the S377-588-Fc fusion protein is not expected to induce antibodies in humans. Second, S377-588-Fc will be mainly used for urgent life-saving treatment at the early stage of MERS-CoV infection. Even if it does elicit anti-RBD antibodies in the patient several weeks after use, the patient may have passed through the most dangerous acute period.

            "text": "We then tested immunogenicity of the truncated RBD of MERS-CoV S protein in inducing anti-MERS-CoV immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice. Notably, S377-588-Fc elicited elevated MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG antibody responses after each boost, reaching the highest level after the 3rd vaccination (Fig. 4). These mouse antisera exhibited potent neutralizing antibody responses with neutralizing antibody titers of \u223c1:1,500, which are much higher than those induced by S377-662-Fc [15]. These data suggest that the truncated RBD fragment containing residues 377-588 is more immunogenic in inducing RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response than the longer RBD fragment containing residues 377-662, possibly because the C-terminal region spanning residues 589-662 contains non-neutralizing epitopes, which may compete with the neutralizing epitopes in the residues 377-588 region in eliciting antibody responses. In addition, the residues 589-662 fragment may destabilize the core conformation of the RBD. Analysis of the crystal structure of the RBD suggests that cysteines 379 and 585 are both involved in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the RBD by forming disulfide bonds with their respective cysteine partners. A few extra residues (e.g., residues 377-378 at the N-terminus and residues 586-588 at the C-terminus) may be needed to flank these cysteines for the proper formation of the disulfide bonds (Fig. 6) [19]. However, the extended region at the C-terminus (residues 589-662) may have adverse effect on tertiary conformation of the core structure (residues 379-585). Therefore, this truncated RBD fragment (residues 377-588) may have reached the optimal length of RBD that contains the intact functional domain (RBM: residues 484-567) and major neutralizing epitopes, and maintains a stable core conformation.",
