The causative agent, the PRRS virus (PRRSV), was identified in the early 1990s [1]. PRRSV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus with a genome of approximately 15 kb, and it belongs to family Arteriviridae and order Nidovirales[1]. A remarkable amount of genetic variation has been observed among the PRRSVs isolates worldwide, particularly in Nsp2 [2-5], ORF5 [2-8] and the nucleocapsid (the ORF 7 product) [3,5,8,9]. The genetic characteristics of the PRRSV strains clearly indicate the existence of two major genotypes, the European type (EU genotype, type 1) and the North American type (NA genotype, type 2) [1].",

The clinical presentation of PRRSV can range from asymptomatic to devastating, with symptoms such as listlessness, emaciation, hyperpnea, dyspnea, chemosis, abortion, stillbirth and a reduction in semen quality [1]. However, infection with PRRSV predominantly exists at a subclinical level, participating as a cofactor in porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) and porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) [10]. PRRSV can be detected using molecular methods from nasal fluid, salivary, serum and tonsil specimens from naturally infected pigs [11]. However, because PRRSV is common within the swine population, no quantitative real-time PCR assays have been described using the serum samples of both symptomatic and asymptomatic PRRSV-infected pigs.",

Zip nucleic acids (ZNA) are oligonucleotide-oligocation conjugates with multiple cationic spermine moieties attached to the nucleic acid oligomer [25]. The melting temperature of a hybridized ZNA is easily predictable and increases linearly with the length of the oligocation [25]. ZNA were shown to enable specific and sensitive reactions when used as a primer for PCR and reverse transcription [26]. The present study describes a sensitive method for detecting type 2 PRRSV using real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR with ZNA probes.",

Similar reports had been made for another major viral agent of PRDC, PCV2 [32-34]. However, there were no previous studies performed for this disease.
