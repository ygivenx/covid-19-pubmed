UP refers to pneumonia, which could be life\u2010threatening, characterized by rapid progression, a normal white blood cell count range, and poor response to antibiotics.1 Although the common pathogens causing UP are viruses or atypical pathogens, their overlapping clinical manifestations can impede the ability of clinicians to directly diagnose the causative pathogens, which may lead to unnecessary antimicrobial usage. Thus, rapid and precise diagnosis of the causative agents is critical for the prompt management of UP.",

For example, rapid antigen testing has only a 40%\u2010100% sensitivity for adult influenza and is dependent on the use of specific scientific techniques, whereas culturing viruses can take up to 10 days.2 In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)\u2013based methods for the detection of viral pathogens due to their excellent diagnostic ability in identifying a broad spectrum of pathogens.3 FilmArray multiplex PCR (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc, a bioM\u00e9rieux Company) is a NAAT method that can be used to detect multiple pathogens in a single test. In May 2011, the FilmArray respiratory panel (FA\u2010RP) was FDA cleared for the detection of 17 respiratory viral pathogens, including Influenza A (H1\u20102009, H3, H1, and \u201cnot subtyped\u201d)/B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E), human rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza (including subtype 1, 2, 3, and 4), and three bacteria (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae). The turnaround time using this panel is approximately 1 hour; thus, this technique can ease the rapid and accurate identification of the pathogens causing UP.4\n",

To this end, we prospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with UP and analyzed the pathogen detection ability of the FA\u2010RP.

Notably, however, when performing this test, pre\u2010treatment of specimens with high viscosity, such as sputum, is essential; otherwise, the reactions are likely to fail. Here, we pre\u2010treated samples following the procedure described by Branche,5 using a clean swab to stir the sputum and then placing it into VTM, so that the pathogens were transferred into a low viscosity medium that is suitable for the FA\u2010RP. Previous studies have reported that lower respiratory tract specimens should be accorded higher sampling priority (ie BALF > sputum > NPS), and have indicated that the performance of the FA\u2010RP in patients with pneumonia could be improved by using BALF.8, 9, 10 Consistently, in the present study, we obtained higher positive rates when using BALF and sputum samples than when using NPS, although the difference was not significant (78.8% vs 61.5%, P = .166). Moreover, in recent years, saliva has also shown potential as a suitable material for the molecular detection of respiratory viruses.11\n",

Compared with other Influenza A infection, H7N9 patients tend to present with a more clinically severe manifestation and require more aggressive treatment. Thus, in these cases, further subtyping is necessary. In the study, we obtained test results of \u201cInfluenza A virus not subtyped\u201d in 13 cases, among which 11 were finally identified as H7N9 based on real\u2010time PCR. Consequently, in clinical practice, when FA\u2010RP reports a not subtyped Influenza A virus, further subtyping, particularly for avian influenza virus, including H7N9, H5N1, and H5N6 should be carried out immediately.",

In contrast, for the control group patients who did not receive precise diagnosis of causing agents, no comparable isolation measures were undertaken. Such a lack of an accurate diagnosis may lead to a delay in patient isolation and, consequently, the wider spread of viruses. Moreover, for these patients, we consciously sought to regularly analyze the viral nucleic acids in the patient's respiratory specimens using real\u2010time PCR, and patients were discharged only after the nucleic acid test proved negative, thereby reducing the risk of the disease spreading.",

We found that compared with the control cohort, the intervention group had significantly lower antimicrobial DDDs, particularly with respect to the use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs. These results thus serve to highlight that given the benefit of an accurate diagnosis of the etiology, a more reasonable antibiotic usage could be achieved. These results are partially consistent with the findings of some previously published studies. For example, Rogers et al17 evaluated the outcomes in pediatric patients (3 months to 21 years old) admitted to hospital with an acute respiratory illness, and, similar to the findings of the present study, found that the use of FA\u2010RP facilitated a reduction in the duration of antibiotic use and the length of hospitalization. However, another randomized controlled trial discovered that use of the FA\u2010RP was not associated with a reduction in the overall duration of antibiotic usage.18 Nevertheless, a higher number of patients in the FA\u2010RP group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than those in the control group. Given these inconclusive findings, further studies are required concerning the impact of FA\u2010RP on the clinical decisions regarding pneumonia.",

As a result, intervention group unexpectedly showed longer duration of hospital stay than the control group (12.1 vs 7.6 days, P = .001). One reasonable explanation is that subjects in the intervention group had more severe cases of pneumonia than those in the control group (higher PSI, Table 3), that is, a more severe condition may lead to a prolonged hospital stay. More importantly, stricter criteria of discharge were required for the intervention group. According to regulations sanctioned by the Chinese Ministry of Public Health in 2009, discharge of Influenza A H1N1 patients demands both a recovery of condition and two consecutive negative test results of viral nucleic acid in respiratory specimens. Therefore, intervention group patients positive for Influenza A took follow\u2010up PCR tests. The patients could not be discharged from the hospital until they met the criteria. In contrast, for the control group, lacking precise diagnosis of causing agents, no such criteria were required. In our practice, application of FA\u2010RP prolonged the length of stay; however, we believe additional benefits concerning public health and disease control were achieved.",
