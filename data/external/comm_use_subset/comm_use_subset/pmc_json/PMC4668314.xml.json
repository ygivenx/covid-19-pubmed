            "text": "Licorice, the root of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, is a well-recognized, natural sweetener and used as a traditional herbal medicine for the treatment of various pathological conditions, including allergies, liver disease, gastric ulcers, and adrenal insufficiency [1, 2]. A number of components have been isolated from licorice, including triterpene saponins, flavonoids, polysaccharides, and other substances [3]. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), a major biologically active constituent of licorice root accounting for the sweet taste, is a triterpene glycoside containing one molecule of 18-glycyrrhetinic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid [4]. So far, GA has been reported to have a variety of pharmacological activities like antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activities [5\u20138]. It has been shown that GA can promote function of endothelial system and secretion of cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 1 and interferon- (IFN-) \u03b1 [9], induce maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) [10], increase T cells proliferation and production of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 [11, 12], augment natural killer (NK) cell activity [13], enhance phagocytic capacity and nitric oxide (NO) production in activated macrophages [14], and downregulate the production of IL-8 and eotaxin-1 in human lung fibroblast cells [4]. These studies indicated that GA may serve as an immune modulator which precisely regulates the cellular immunity.",

            "text": "Macrophages have long been considered as important effector cells that play a key role in host defense and homeostasis [15, 16]. Depending on the microenvironment, macrophages can acquire distinct morphological and functional properties. Two extremes in the spectrum of macrophage phenotypes are often referred to as classically activated macrophages (or M1) and alternatively activated macrophages (or M2) [17, 18]. The M1 phenotype is polarized by Th1 cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and is characterized by high capacity to present antigen, high levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, IL-6) secretion and increased levels of NO production, enhanced capacity to kill intracellular pathogens and tumor cells, and promotion of polarized Th1 and Th17 responses [15, 19, 20]. In contrast, M2 macrophages are polarized by Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 and are characterized by minimal production of inflammatory molecules and increased expression of mannose receptor (MR), chitinase-like Ym1, found in inflammatory zone-1 (FIZZ1), and arginase-1 (Arg1). M2 cells are associated with anti-inflammatory and homeostatic functions linked to wound healing, tissue remodeling and repair, scavenge debris, and participation in polarized Th2 reactions [21, 22]. Generally, M1 macrophages are considered proinflammatory cells, whereas M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of GA on the polarization of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and found that GA promotes M1, rather than M2 macrophage polarization with enhanced phagocytosis and bacterial killing capacity. We further demonstrated that GA-mediated macrophage polarization involves activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways.",

As shown in Figure 3, the morphological characteristics of the GA-treated cells were more similar to those in M1-positive groups. To confirm whether GA mediates M1 macrophages polarization of BMDMs, we examined the expressions of M1- and M2-associated markers (Figure 4). FACS analysis demonstrated that GA markedly increased the expression of M1 surface marker CCR7, from 6.5% to 20.35%, whereas it decreased the expression of M2 surface marker MR, from 12.86% to 10.75% (Figure 4(a)). Furthermore, GA upregulated the expression of M1-associated cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IL-6, at both the mRNA and protein levels; however, GA downregulated the mRNA expression of M2 markers, such as Ym1 and MR (Figures 4(b) and 4(c)).

As anticipated, we also observed that GA obviously enhanced iNOS protein expression in BMDMs in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5(b)), and accordingly, the NO generation of GA-treated groups was significantly higher than those in the control groups (Figure 5(c)). In summary, these data supported the notion that GA could promote M1 macrophage polarization in BMDMs.",

To determine whether GA triggers such functions on M1-polarized BMDMs, we first examined the internalization of FITC-labeled dextran by FACS. The BMDMs pretreated with GA for 12 h showed markedly increased uptake of FITC-dextran as compared with the control groups (Figure 6(a)). To support these findings, we evaluated the effect of GA on the uptake of E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium by BMDMs. Interestingly, GA significantly increased the uptake of extracellular bacteria E. coli K88 as compared with the control groups, while the internalization of intracellular bacteria S. typhimurium had no significant difference between the GA-treated groups and the control groups (Figure 6(b)). These inconsistent results of E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium internalization by BMDMs may result from the mechanisms by which S. typhimurium efficiently invades macrophages. After bacteria internalization by BMDMs, we further examined the bactericidal capacity of macrophages. As shown in Figure 6(b), GA markedly reduced the bacterial survival both in E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium infection models, relative to the control groups, respectively. To sum up, these results demonstrated that GA could enhance the phagocytic and bactericidal capacity of BMDMs.",

Treatment with GA led to a rapid and transient increase in the phosphorylated forms of all three MAPKs in BMDMs, and phosphorylation reached its peak at 30 min of treatment and declined to almost basal level within 60 min (Figure 7(a)).

Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2 pathway led to a marked decrease of IL-10 expression, at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 8). Together, these data thus indicated that NF-\u03baB and JNK activation are required for GA-induced M1 macrophages polarization, while ERK1/2 pathway exhibits a regulatory effect via induction of inhibitory factors, such as IL-10.",

A functional phenotype obtained by macrophages is dependent upon interactions with specific stimuli from both endogenous and exogenous environment [17]. However, unlike T cells, which undergo extensive epigenetic modifications during differentiation, macrophages seem to retain their plasticity and respond to further environmental signals [16]. Previous studies observed that a phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 phenotype in the macrophage population occurs in the pathological process of cancer [16, 30]. Moreover, some pathogens, such as Francisella tularensis and Leishmania major, are able to redirect the phenotype of macrophages from M1 to M2 and consequently survive at the expense of the host [29, 32]. Therefore, targeting of this macrophage phenotypic plasticity may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for such diseases and infections.",

M1 macrophages produce high levels of iNOS which synthesizes NO from arginine, while M2 macrophages counteract iNOS activity by producing Arg1 which degrades arginine to urea and ornithine, thus reducing the production of NO [29]. We observed that GA reciprocally regulated the expression of iNOS and Arg1 in BMDMs, which led to an increased production of NO. These results are supported by a report that GA enhanced NO production in IFN-\u03b3-activated macrophages [14]. Moreover, M1 macrophages are known as potent effector cells with enhanced phagocytosis and bactericidal capacity [16]. Consistent with these notions, GA enhanced uptake of FITC-dextran and E. coli K88 by BMDMs and markedly decreased the intracellular survival of E. coli K88 and S. typhimurium. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report on the bacterial killing capacity of GA-treated macrophages. Our data provide evidence that GA exhibits a protective effect in host defense against intracellular microorganisms by mediating the M1 functional polarization of macrophages.",

            "text": "Since a macrophage polarization requires activation of specific transcription factors, the possible pathways involved in GA-polarized M1 macrophages could be carefully identified. It is known that MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK) regulate various inflammatory cytokines expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors. NF-\u03baB proteins are detached from its inhibitor I\u03baBs after activation and translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and finally regulate the transcription of a large number of genes [34]. We found that GA induced phosphorylation of all three MAPKs, which was accompanied by nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Inhibition of JNK and NF-\u03baB activation by their respective inhibitors significantly decreased GA-induced production of NO and M1-related cytokines. Recent study demonstrated that JNK was required for M1 macrophage polarization in HFD-fed mice, and deficiency of JNK led to decreased expression of M1 genes and increased expression of M2 genes in adipose tissue macrophages [31]. In addition, NF-\u03baB pathway was also reported to be associated with M1 macrophage polarization [16]. Inhibition of p38 MAPK did no effect on GA-induced M1 markers; however, inhibition of ERK1/2 resulted in unexpected increases in both NO and M1 cytokines production. ERK1/2 seems to be a regulator which limits inflammation via induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines [35]. We further confirmed that inhibition of ERK1/2 markedly decreased GA-induced IL-10 expression in BMDMs. To sum up, JNK and NF-\u03baB activation are required for GA-induced M1 macrophages polarization, while ERK1/2 pathway exhibits a regulatory effect in prevention of excessive inflammation.",

For instance, GA decreased cellular attachment or uptake of CpG-DNA and strongly impaired LPS-induced homodimerization of TLR4 in RAW 264.7 cells [16, 36, 37].
