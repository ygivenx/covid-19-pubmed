Part of SAON patients even evolved to hip joint collapse with subsequent total joint replacement [6], [7], and its long-term durability however still remained a big challenge [8]. How to prevent accumulation of SAON lesions is the first-line strategy for avoiding joint collapse. Therefore, establishment of appropriated SAON animal models that mimic clinical etiology and even evolves to joint collapse is desirable prior to translating prevention and treatment experimental protocols into clinical validation and applications.",

            "text": "Up to now there is lack of ideal animal models to exam the treatment efficiency or therapeutic strategy for SAON-associated joint collapse. The limitation of the existing animal models, such as rabbit [9]\u2013[13], rat [14]\u2013[17], mouse [18], [19], pig [20], [21] and chicken [22] is that they fail to progress to the end-stage of SAON, i.e. structural collapse of the weight-bearing joints. With bipedality, high activity level and large enough bodyweight similar to that of human beings, ON model to be developed in emu femoral head could provide a unique opportunity to progress to human-like femoral head collapse [23], [24]. Focal cryogenic (liquid nitrogen) insults [23], [25] and alternative cooling and heating insults [26] have also been tested to induce ON in emus with femoral head collapse. However, these models are not etiology- and or pathophysiology-orientated for SAON research. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to establish a SAON model in bipedal emus, with potentials to bone structural deterioration with subsequent femoral head collapse, a condition seen in SAON patients attributed to similar biomechanics or loading ratio imposed onto the hip joint [23], [24]. Such a model would be essential for testing strategies to be developed for potential clinical applications for prevention and treatment of steroid-associated joint collapse.",

All of them showed effectiveness in ON induction, yet with varying degrees of ON lesions and mortality of animals. Based on our established SAON rabbit model with a high incidence of ON and low or no mortality that was induced by a combination of LPS and MPS [11], [30], we hypothesized that such a combination of pulsed LPS and MPS injections might also be able to induce SAON in bipedal emus with subsequent hip joint collapse.",

Five emus assigned to the SAON group were treated with a combination of LPS and MPS. Three emus were used as controls without receiving either LPS or MPS. The emus were euthanized by intravenous injection of overdose of pentobarbital via jugular vein at 24 weeks post injection. The details of this combined protocol were described as follows: each emu was intravenously injected with lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) twice via jugular vein with 8 \u03bcg/kg body weight at an interval of 4 days from day 0. Thereafter, three injections of methylprednisolone (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Peapack, NJ, USA) with 10 mg/kg body weight were given intramuscularly at gluteus muscle at an interval of 2 days. In addition, each emu was intramuscularly injected at gluteus muscle with 40 mg Omeprazole Sodium and orally with 250 mg Amoxicillin Dispersible per day for 7 days immediately after induction to prevent potential stomach ulcers and systemic infection (Figure S1).",

After the initial scanning, 2-dimentiaonal (2\u2013D) images were realigned in the Z-axis along the direction of femoral neck for further evaluation. For separating the signals of the mineralized tissue from the background signal, noise was removed using a low-pass Gaussian filter (Sigma = 2.5, Support = 2) and mineralized tissue was then defined at a threshold of 85. 3\u2013D structures of entire femoral heads were then reconstructed. The collapse was identified when fracture and/or clear deformation appeared in femoral head. A 10 mm \u00d710 mm \u00d78 mm region in the centre of femoral head was defined as the region of interest (ROI) for analysis and comparison. ROI was defined within subchondral region centered in the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral heads, where the largest thickness of this ROI was 1/3 diameter of the femoral head. Bone mineral density (BMD), bone tissue volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) in the ROI were measured separately by the workstation with the built-in HR-pQCT software.",

A microscope imaging system (Leica Q500MC; Leica Micro-systems, Wetzlar, Germany) was used to digitalize the histological sections for histomorphometric evaluation. 1) Examination of ON: The entire area of each H&E stained section was examined for the presence of ON with the established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow [13], [28]. The femoral head with at least one ON lesion was considered as ON+, while that with no ON lesion was considered as ON- [11], [35]. 2) Quantification of fat cells in bone marrow: Fat cells were quantified for both average of fat cell size and fat cell area fraction. The total bone marrow in subchondral bone was 200 fold magnified and captured. The fat cells were manually traced and then quantified. The fat cell size was interpreted by Fetet's diameter, i.e. the longest distance between any two points along a region of interest (ROI) boundary [11]. The fat cell area fraction was defined as total marrow fat cell area normalized by total marrow tissue area [35]. 3) Histomorphometry of the subchondral plate: the thickness of subchondral bone plate of the femoral head was measured on the 50\u00d7 images. At least 10 views per section were randomly selected for measuring. The thickness was examined by measuring point-to-point distance from the top of the calcified cartilage to the deep surface of the subchondral bone plate [36]. 4) Examination of articular cartilage: The average thickness of cartilage were examined by the total area of cartilage divided by the length of cartilage band measured from the manually traced region on the entire frontal sections for evaluation under 200\u00d7 magnification. The thickness of cartilage at the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head was also examined. The proteoglycans content was quantified by measuring the thickness of safranin O stained articular cartilage. 5) Calculation of osteoblasts: The osteoblast perimeter percentage (%Ob.Pm) was calculated as the ratio of the total perimeter of the trabecular surface covered by osteoblasts to the whole perimeter of the trabecular surface [37]. 6) Blood vessel quantification: The number of blood vessels within the collapsed region or the corresponding region of the non-collapsed femoral head was quantified on H&E sections [38].",

Abnormal signals were firstly detected at week 2 post-induction, showing large scales of edema at the proximal femora. This phenomena is similar to clinical ON where the bone marrow edema was found from MRI earlier than either formation of the necrotic lesion or the collapse of the necrotic fragment [43]. However, MRI of emu hips merely shows bone marrow edema without typical band pattern shown in initial MRI signaling of ON patients [44], [45]. This could be explained by the differences in anatomy and physiology of human (mammals) and emu (aves), such as that the bone marrow of emu hip mainly presented in subchondral bone in a shell-shaped region and there was hollow structure in emu's bone marrow cavity at both femoral neck and head. Irrespective such differences, there were common structural features, i.e. ON lesion and hip joint collapse found in SAON emus and this would provide a platform, i.e. a large bipedal animal model for testing biomaterials developed for bone defect repair, including for that after surgical core-decompression in hip joints, a condition indicated for patients with early stage of ON.",

These were essential indices of later joint collapse, typically seen in SAON patients [50], [51] that were substantiated in our histomorphometric analysis. On the contrary, our micro-CT evaluation for the central region of the femoral head, where no bone structural collapse was demonstrated, implied that the pulsed LPS-MPS induction protocol did not result in general osteoporosis as no difference in boney structural and BMD was found between SAON emus and normal controls in regions away from the subchondral bone. This finding was also similar to a bone densitometry study in SARS patients who underwent pulsed steroid treatment in Hong Kong [52]. No obvious osteoporosis found in SAON patients with joint collapse or animals were mainly explained by short-term effects of pulsed corticosteroid administration that resulted in local damage of vasculature in the subchondral bone region and impairment of bone marrow mononuclear cells, which triggered up-regulation of osteoclastic activities and inadequate bone formation known as destructive repair [1], [6], [10], [34], [53], [54]. Yet, long-term steroid administration was known to be able to induce secondary osteoporosis in patients [55] or animals [14].",

The contact stress of femoral head was reported with a maximum hip contact force of approximately 5.5 times of body weight in emus, directed axially along its femoral neck, which was moderately larger than that of humans [56] and the contact stress magnitude and the sites of habitual loading on the femoral head was also comparable between emu hip and the human hip [57]. That the joint biomechanics plays a crucial role for NO-induced hip joint collapse was also well supported by findings obtained from bipedal and quadrupedal animals. In fact, the ON-induction protocol with a combination of LPS and MPS successfully induced SAON in quadruped animals, yet without resulting in subchondral collapse [11], although inadequate repair was also demonstrated in quadruped SAON animals [35]. Besides emu study, another report showed that the chicken was also bipedal animal suitable for building up SAON animal model [22], yet their induction protocol did not result in hip joint collapse. In order to mimic ON and hip joint collapse, we tested large bipedal emus not because of its similarity in hip joint biomechanics to that of human but mainly that emu hip was sizeable to perform core decompression and testing porous scaffold biomaterials developed for potential clinical applications [58]\u2013[60].",

As SAON incidence is often dose-dependent and the purpose of the current preclinical study is to establish a SAON bipedal large animal model with high incidence of ON and hip joint collapse, we tested much higher dose of MPS as compared with clinical recommended dose for SARS patients [61]. Differ to human situation where only MPS was used, we used both LPS and MPS pulsed treatment, where LPS served the purpose to mimic clinical conditions, i.e. disease-related tissue inflammation [11], [27], in addition to higher mechanical loading imposed to the hip joint in emus where emu hip joint share 65\u201370% of the body weight as compared with around 60% of body weight in human [56].",

It would be of interest to study in details the differences in physical or immune responses between human and birds in SAON in future. In our previous study, we established SAON in rabbit with 1\u00d7LPS (10 \u00b5g/kg) +3\u00d7MPS (20mg/kg) [11]. As emu was estimated with similar body surface area to that of human, we calculated the current experimental dose based on the conventional human-rabbit dose conversion. However, the dose for the initial experiment for emu was 6.67 mg/kg. As we found that emus could tolerate larger dosage from our pilot study, we increased MPS dose to 10 mg/kg for the current study at a time interval of 2 days for avoiding potential side-effect of MPS injection. Specific design for studying dosing effects (amount and frequency of LPS and MPS treatment) would also be of interests for further studies.",
