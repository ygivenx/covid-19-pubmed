Replicating and non-replicating adenoviruses have been shown to be safe vectors in numerous clinical studies4. However, serious concerns regarding the safety of the Ad5 vector arose when a clinical trial was halted in response to its fatal adverse effects on an ornithine-transcarbamylase-deficient patient in 19995. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the virological and biological features that define the infectivity and possible toxicity of Ad5 in different individuals is urgently required. Immunosuppression occurs in various types of patients, including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the recipients of organ transplantation, and those with hypogammaglobulinaemia6, 7. All of these patients are generally characterized by an increased and distinctive susceptibility to various types of pathogens, depending on the nature of the immune defect8. However, the behaviour, including biodistribution and residence time, of the Ad5 vector (Adv5) in the context of immunodeficiency is poorly understood.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the risk associated with different modes of Adv5 delivery, especially in immunodeficient hosts, and to identify the mechanisms underlying the resulting immunopathology.

These results indicate that no mature T or B cells were produced after the Rag2 gene was knocked out.

To document the distribution and kinetics of Adv5 in both immunocompetent C57BL/6 and immunodeficient Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse models, the animals were inoculated with 5 \u00d7 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu)/kg Adv5 by the IM or IV route. Because Ad5-Fluc expresses the bioluminescent luciferase protein, BLI was used to monitor the progress, sites, and degree of Adv5 expression in real time, based on the detected luciferase bioluminescence. In vivo luminescent signals were visible at the inoculation sites of both IM and IV injections and in the abdomen as early as 6 h after administration (Fig. 1a,b, left), suggesting that the bioluminescent signals generated by Ad5-Fluc are strong enough to show the distribution of Adv5, even in the very early stage of its dissemination. By day 9, the peak luminescence intensity and greatest systemic dissemination were observed, extending from the abdomen to the limbs and head in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice infected via the IV route. However, we observed a rapid damping of luciferase expression in the wildtype C57BL/6 mice, and Adv5 was almost cleared by day 20 post-inoculation, regardless of its route of delivery (IM or IV). Interestingly, the luciferase expression from Adv5-Fluc that was injected IM persisted and increased continuously in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice until the end of the experiment (day 35), but no systemic dissemination was observed (Fig. 1a, left). Without clearance of the Adv5-infected cells by T cells and B cells, the luciferase signal was significantly stronger and more persistent in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, regardless of the inoculation route (P < 0.01; Fig. 1a,b, right). These data indicate that T cells and B cells are essential for the clearance of Adv5 administered by either the IM or IV route.\n",

Judging from the live imaging, the biodistribution of IV-inoculated Adv5 was wider in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice than in the C57BL/6 mice, especially in the limbs and mouth. However, the bioluminescent signals did not differ in any of the dissected organs other than the limbs and mouth, and luminescence was detected in the liver, spleen, and lung (Fig. 1d).

Therefore, the striking difference between the Adv5 profiles of the wildtype and immunodeficient mice might be related to the magnitudes of their cellular immune responses. The cytokine dysregulation increases the risks associated with Adv5 inoculation in immunodeficient mice. We examined the magnitude of the cellular response induced in the immunodeficient Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice and the wildtype mice. Notably, the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice showed no clearance of the Adv5-infected cells in vivo, at least at 35 days after IM or IV injection. Many pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, including the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-12p70, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-10, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b2, and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), were measured 1 day before and 30 days after inoculation. The cytokine levels showed little change in the C57BL/6 mice after Adv5 inoculation. Although the level of MIP-1\u03b1 expression by C57BL/6 mice trended lower at 30 days post-inoculation, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly lower expression levels of MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 than the C57BL/6 mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 3h,i), possibly due to the lack of mature T and B lymphocytes in these mice. As expected, the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in the post-Ad5-Fluc-inoculated Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice than in the pre-Ad5-Fluc-inoculated Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 3b,c). However, although the MCP-1 levels tended to be higher in these mice after Adv5 inoculation, this difference did not reach statistical significance. When we compared the effects of IV and IM administration, although the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 trend higher in the IV group than in the IM group, especially in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, these differences are not statistically significant. Combined with the compensatory NK cell increase in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice that was detected with flow cytometry, these data suggest that the innate immune response was increased and prolonged in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice.\n",

No significant differences were detected between the body weight gains in the IV-infected, IM-infected, and na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice (P = 0.12; Fig. 4a). However, the body weight gain in the IV-infected Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly lower than those in the other groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 4b). A systemic histopathological examination was performed in many tissues, including the brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, thymus, muscle, and testis/ovary. No pathological changes were observed in the na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4c) or na\u00efve Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 4d) or in the immunocompetent or immunodeficient mice inoculated with Adv5 via the IM route (Fig. 4e,f). Therefore, the IM route is relatively safe for use in the inoculation of Adv5-based vaccines. However, the IV-inoculated groups displayed inflammatory signs in the liver (Fig. 4g,h, upper). Moreover, glial nodules formed and oligodendrocytes increased in the brains of the immunodeficient Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice that were inoculated with Adv5 via the IV route. In contrast, these changes were not found in the brains of C57BL/6 mice infected via the IV route (Fig. 4g,h, lower). ALT is a cytosolic enzyme that mainly exists in the liver, while AST is primarily present in mitochondria and cytoplasm in the liver. Once hepatocytes are damaged, ALT and AST will leak into circulation and the levels of these enzymes will increase in serum. IV administration of Adv5 to the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT, Fig. 4i) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST, Fig. 4j) activities compared to that in control mice (P < 0.05). But there were no significant differences within the IM inoculated C57BL/6, Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 and na\u00efve mice (Fig. 4i,j).\n",

This is a significant advance toward the development of Adv5-based therapies and vaccine improvement, and it extends our understanding of Adv5 immunopathology. In the context of preclinical drug safety evaluation, rats are believed to have a higher similarity to humans, providing predictable useful experimental data, and pharmaceutical companies use rats for a large proportion of their mandatory toxicity testing12. Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 rats, generated with the TALENs technology, were previously used to evaluate the toxicity and biodistribution of Adv5 in an immunodeficient population9. In this study, we found that Adv5 was more widely disseminated in the Rag2-deficient mice than in the Rag2-deficient rats, which suggests that these two rodent species differently predict the outcome in humans. However, in both species, the distributions and residence times in immunodeficient animals were different from those in immunocompetent ones, suggesting that Adv5 should be used with caution in various groups of immunosuppressed patients because considerably more serious adverse effects can be expected in these patients. Consistent with this, adenovirus is ubiquitous and causes generally mild, self-limiting infections in immunocompetent adults, but it can lead to a serious, often life-threatening illness in solid-organ transplant recipients and AIDS patients13, 14.",

Most of the virus accumulated in the liver and was eliminated by Kupffer cells within 24 h15. In this study, the peak level of transgene expression was significantly higher and the kinetics of viral clearance was significantly slower in the T and B cell-deficient mice than in the wildtype mice after infection via either the IV or IM route. Therefore, we speculate that the T and B cells play important roles in the clearance of the Ad5 virus. Until now, the specific role of B cells during primary infection has been somewhat controversial. Although mice lacking both CD8+ T cells and B cells died after influenza infection, mice lacking CD4+ T cells and B cells survived16. However, Lee et al. showed that mice lacking B cells succumbed to influenza H1N1 (PR8) infection despite the infiltration of a larger number of CD8+ T cells17.",

In contrast, after its IV administration, Adv5 rapidly binds to circulating platelets, causing their activation/aggregation and subsequent entrapment in the liver sinusoids.

We found that the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed significantly higher levels of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 after Adv5 inoculation than the immunocompetent mice. Positive correlations between viral immunopathology and TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 levels have also been reported in clinical cases and animal models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H5N1 infection26, 27. This release or synthesis of TNF, in turn, plays a major causative role in the pathological changes associated with IV adenovirus infusion as well as a role in the induction of the antiviral immune response28, 29. The IFN-\u03b3 produced by T and NK cells plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity against a broad spectrum of intracellular pathogens, and it also activates antigen presentation and primes TNF-\u03b1 release by macrophages30. The inflammation associated with a cytokine storm has been shown to begin at a local site and to spread throughout the body via the systemic circulation31. Therefore, we speculate that the brain pathology in the immunodeficient mice was not a direct toxic effect of adenovector delivery, but more likely a secondary effect of inflammation and the immune response to the adenovector, because TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are considered the key cytokines that drive pro-inflammatory activity32.",

            "text": "Notably, hepatic injury was detected in both the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 and wildtype C57BL/6 mice. Muruve showed that neutrophils acutely infiltrate the liver 1\u20136 h after the injection of Adv5. Immune effector cells are recruited to the sites of injury in response to chemokines, such as MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES. These signals directly correlate with the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the degree of hepatic injury33. Similar results were reported by Lieber, who reported a biphasic increase in serum TNF, with the first peak contributed by macrophages shortly after adenovirus administration and the second major peak contributed by lymphocytes after several days34. However, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 decreased significantly after Adv5 infection in the Rag2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice. MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 are produced by macrophages and activate human granulocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, which may lead to acute neutrophilic inflammation35. Further research is required to determine whether or not the high-level expression of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 and the low levels of MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 in Adv5-infected mice are the causes or effects of the observed pathological changes. Moreover, the dynamics of cytokine expression during infection in vivo should also be investigated to detect any transient changes in cytokine levels. It is a pity that the data on cytokine response and histopathology were not conducted in rats, we believe that the conclusions will be more robust complementing with additional data in rats, and we will pay attention to this problem in the future study.",

We believe that the focus should be on two types of approaches. The first is dosage control. Some findings indicate that the hepatotropism of Adv5 is dose-limiting, and a certain threshold dose of injected Adv5 can saturate the capacity of Kupffer cells for adenovirus uptake, leading to the systemic dissemination of Adv5 particles. This then results in acute hepatocellular damage and the potential infection of other cell types that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, thus exacerbating the systemic toxicity of the vector36. The second approach involves modifying the method or route of delivery, using for instance, hydrodynamic injection, ultrasound-guided intramyocardial gene delivery, or other techniques to locally deliver low vector doses directly into the target organs, reducing the systemic dissemination of the vector, the inflammatory responses, and the immunotoxicity37.",

Although useful in preclinical studies, in general, the predictions from rodent studies have limited applicability to human outcomes. A single animal model can never recapitulate all of the aspects of human viral-vector-based gene therapies and vaccines because each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines have been constructed based on various different systems. In this study, recombinant Adv5 was generated using a Cre/loxP-based system38, which has been used in several vaccines, including an HIV vaccine39, and in gene therapy40. Notably, the promoter and overall design of the Ad5 expression cassette has a major impact on Adv5 toxicity and distribution in vivo. Therefore, the safety of recombinant Ad5 products generated with other construction systems must be evaluated in future studies. Additionally, the relative data should be obtained from older animals because gene therapy is predominantly administered to adults with degenerated tissues/cells.",

We found that the ideal route of administration was IM, by which even immunodeficient animals were successfully and safely treated with a high dose of the vaccine. Adverse effects were observed when the animals were treated by the IV route, which has been used in previous gene therapy applications. Therefore, in accord with previous reports, we believe that Ad5 vectors are generally safe for vaccine and gene therapy applications. However, future research should focus on any adverse effects in recipients with congenital immunodeficient backgrounds or virus-induced immunodeficiency. Finally, visualizing Ad5-Fluc infection in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice and rats is an additional or alternative way to study adenoviral infection because it is convenient, sensitive, and requires the use of fewer animals.",
