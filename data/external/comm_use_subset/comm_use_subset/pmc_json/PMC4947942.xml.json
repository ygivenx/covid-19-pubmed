Surveillance of ARI/ILI in community\u2010based settings may better represent population\u2010based respiratory viral activity. Direct comparison of viral activity in the community versus in hospitalized patients (derived from the same community) could further help determine the impact of specific viruses and identify the utility of including community\u2010based samples for ARI/ILI surveillance.",

Households in the MoSAIC study were selected using a random sample of participants, previously enrolled in a large community\u2010based survey (https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/impact/wicer/). To be eligible for the MoSAIC study, households had three or more members with at least one member under 18 years of age, were Spanish\u2010 or English\u2010speaking, and had a cellular telephone with text messaging. During the initial home visit, one volunteer from the household was selected to be the household reporter who received and responded to text messages. The reporter from participating households was sent twice weekly text messages to identify members with symptoms of ARI/ILI. Nasal swabs were collected by research staff in the homes of individuals with ARI/ILI if they fulfilled at least two of the following clinical criteria: fever, runny nose/congestion, sore throat, cough, and/or myalgia. For infants, these criteria were modified to include the sole criterion of runny nose/congestion.4 The institutional review board at CUMC (New York, New York) approved the community surveillance study.",
