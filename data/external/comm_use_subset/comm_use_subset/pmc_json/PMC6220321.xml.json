            "text": "Acute respiratory infections account for about half of all infectious diseases, with high morbidity and mortality worldwide1. These diseases are transmitted through the respiratory tract. In particular, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Influenza virus are highly contagious and lethal2,3. Rapid diagnosis is very important to reduce the death rate and interrupt transmission. Accurate identification of the pathogens causing acute respiratory infections on site allows for rapid and appropriate antibiotic treatment instead of using a wide range of antibiotics or improper antibiotics. Such specific treatment decreases the chance of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria arising. Automated nucleic acid extraction and miniaturized polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems for point-of-care testing have already been commercialized4\u20137, and isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification, rolling circle amplification, and nicking enzyme amplification reaction have been developed8\u201310. Thus, it is expected that a variety of on-site genetic diagnoses will be possible. However, because of the risk of infection during the handling of specimens, infectious agent identification should be handled only by highly skilled experts in enclosed special facilities. Such facilities are only available in large hospitals or laboratories, thereby limiting the speed of acute respiratory infection diagnosis.",

            "text": "The sputum specimen pre-treatment procedures and protocols used to diagnose pathogens such as tuberculosis and pneumonia are complex and very labor intensive. The protocol involves liquefaction, homogenization, dissolution, and inactivation11,12. The pre-treatment methods for infectious sputum specimens currently used in most laboratories require not only daily preparation of reagents but also the process of opening and closing the lid for adding reagents, vortex mixing, and sedimentation using a centrifuge\u2014all of which are done by hand13,14. Because there is a risk of infection during this sample pre-treatment process, the procedures must be carried out by experienced testers wearing special lab suits and masks in enclosed areas that can maintain constant negative pressure15. For some sputum specimens, a lysis reagent alone is not sufficient to liquefy and homogenize the sample, requiring mechanical dissolution through sonication. Gram-positive bacteria have a thicker peptidoglycan layer, and mycobacteria have complex glycolipids in their cell walls, making cell wall disruption more difficult than for other bacteria. To extract nucleic acids from these bacteria, methods such as boiling at 60\u2013100 \u00b0C or high-energy bead beating are currently used to remove complex cell wall structures13,16. Therefore, the sputum pre-treatment process presently used in the laboratory is a significant obstacle to on-site diagnosis of respiratory infections. Simple paper-based sample pre-treatment systems for on-site diagnosis have been reported17\u201319, but they did not eliminate completely the risk of infection and only chemical lysis on paper may not enough to liquefy and lyse a highly viscous sputum sample. There are very few studies that developed a sputum pre-treatment system to allow for point-of-care testing of respiratory infections.",

In addition, we aimed to design a system that seals the sample itself during the pre-treatment process instead of sealing the person from the sample to eliminate the need for sending the sample to a central biosafety containment laboratory for analysis. To overcome problems posed by infectivity and potential cross-contamination during the reagent mixing process, the sputum pre-treatment system developed in this study was designed to allow the reagents to be mixed in a disposable, closed system. Both chemical and mechanical methods of sample dissolution were designed to take place within the closed unit, thereby ensuring promptness, convenience, and safety. To evaluate the performance of the pre-treatment device developed in this study, the effectiveness of sputum sample liquefaction and dissolution were assessed by viscosity and absorbance measurements. We also evaluated the yield of genomic DNA extraction in sputum spiked with cells and performed PCR detection using mycobacteria.",

The sample collection and mechanical lysis chambers are designed for single use. A chemical reagent chamber separated by a blocking membrane is contained in the collection chamber. Isolation of chemical reagents is essential in devices for use in clinical practice to prevent inhalation or ingestion of the reagent. Mechanical dissolution was added to increase the dissolution efficiency and to prevent diagnostic errors related to the degree of liquefaction and homogenization of the sputum. The mechanical lysis chamber has a cylindrical shape with a rotating blade inside. Instead of connecting the blades directly to the motor, the magnets are attached to the blade and motor parts such that the magnetic rotational forces are applied to allow completely closed mechanical dissolution. The mechanical lysis chamber is detachable and disposable. The motor and the battery are portable, with low power consumption.",

            "text": "The high viscosity and lumpy nature of sputum are major hindrances to both antigen- and nucleic acid-based diagnostics. Liquefaction and homogenization of sputum are essential for proper diagnoses. The degree of liquefaction of sputum specimens pretreated with our device was compared with that of the standard method by vortex mixer used in clinical evaluations. The photographs in Fig. 2a show the difference in appearance between non-liquefied raw sputum samples, liquefied sputum samples by the standard lysis method using a vortex mixer, and our pre-treatment device. The non-liquefied sputum had a mass of precipitated viscous materials. The sputum sample liquefied using a vortex mixer appeared to be loosened, but small lumps were still present, and the solution was opaque. In contrast, the sputum sample liquefied using the pre-treatment device had few lumps and was transparent enough to allow viewing of print through the sample. To quantitatively evaluate the ability of liquefaction through mechanical grinding of the pre-treatment device developed in the present study, the viscosity, absorbance of the solution (turbidity), and particle size in the sputum were investigated. Fig. 2b shows the viscosity of sputum before and after liquefaction. The non-liquefied sputum sample (diluted 1:1) had a high viscosity of about 1.7 mPa\u00b7s, and the sputum sample liquefied using the standard method had a relatively low viscosity of about 1.27 mPa\u00b7s. However, the viscosity of the sputum sample liquefied using our device was about 1.01 mPa\u2219s, which was close to the viscosity of PBS (0.93 mPa\u2219s) as measured in this study. The liquefied sputum sample had a relatively uniform viscosity, indicating that the mechanical liquefaction process in the pre-treatment device effectively breaks down the viscous material, with greater efficiency. Absorbance can be used to compare the turbidity of the solution. As the sputum breaks and liquefies, the solution becomes transparent and absorbance at 600 nm decreases. As shown in Fig. 2c, the absorbance at 600 nm of sputum liquefied using the pre-treatment device was 1.92 times lower than that using the standard method. Particle size can also be used to assess the degree of brokenness of the sputum. Microscopic observation of the sputum samples revealed large particles in raw sputum and smaller particles in that liquefied using the standard method (Fig. 2d). In contrast, much smaller particles were seen in the sputum liquefied using the pre-treatment device. Taken together, we confirmed that the liquefaction efficiency of the sputum using the pre-treatment device is superior to that using the standard liquefaction method using vortexing.",

The Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF sample inactivation process recommends a 15 min incubation after adding the chemical reagent for inactivation, but a recent report suggests that 60 min of incubation time is required for complete inactivation of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)13. We compared cell viability after liquefaction by the standard method and our pre-treatment device using dithiothreitol (DTT) solution. After pre-treatment for 30, 60, or 120 s, tests using MTS solution showed that cell viability decreased with increasing treatment time and was significantly lower after inactivation in the pre-treatment device than with vortex mixing for all three treatment times (Fig. 3a). Nearly all of the cells died when treated for 120 s. These results indicate that mechanical dissolution in the pre-treatment device provides more effective DTT treatment and cell wall disruption than does the standard vortex mixer method. This is thought to be a synergistic effect due to mechanical lysis. The use of the lysis solution may lead to cell death much more quickly, and rapid on-site inactivation of the sample will be possible.",

The standard lysis method yielded about 14.4 \u00b5g/mL, whereas the pre-treatment device yielded about 28.2 \u00b5g/mL, nearly double the amount. This higher yield likely resulted from the greater extent of sputum liquefaction and cell lysis provided by the pre-treatment device. The 260/280 ratio, representing the purity of the extracted DNA, was 1.49 by the standard lysis method and 1.42 by the pre-treatment device, with no significant difference. This is because the sputum contains a large amount of protein components; therefore, the extracted sample is considered to have somewhat low 260/280 ratios. However, even though the 260/280 ratio by the standard lysis method and the pre-treatment device was similar, it was confirmed that the concentration of DNA extracted from the liquefied sputum by the pre-treatment device was nearly twice as high as that by the standard lysis method.",

We compared the dissolution rates of the nontuberculous M. fortuitum between vortexing and treatment in our device. As shown by the amplification plot in Fig. 4a, DNA amplification was observed only in the group treated using the pre-treatment device. This result suggests that the mechanical lysis process in the pre-treatment device disrupts the mycobacterial cell wall, allowing for effective DNA extraction. The threshold cycle (Ct) of PCR amplified by lysis time of the closed-type pre-treatment device was 17.726 for 30 s, 18.13f2 for 60 s, and 18.141 for 120 s (Fig. 4b). There is little difference in the Ct values, and it can be concluded that a lysis time from 30 s to 120 s does not have a large effect on PCR amplification. From this result, it can be stated that a lysis time of 30 s is enough for the DNA release from M. fortuitum. The slightly increase in the Ct value over the lysis time may be due to damage to the DNA by the lysis reagent20. Electrophoresis results confirm that no DNA was amplified in samples treated by the vortex method, whereas all the bands were present after treatment in the pre-treatment device. The amplified gene of 173 bp length was confirmed by the electrophoresis and corresponding to 100\u2013200 bp (Fig. 4c).",

The sputum liquefaction efficiency of the closed-type pre-treatment device was investigated by comparison with that of the standard method. Distilled water (1 mL) containing 0.1% dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the chemical reagent chamber, which is separated from the sputum collector by a rubber membrane. The sputum sample was placed in the sputum collector, the lid was closed, and the switch was pressed to rotate the blade for 30 s. DTT allows the sputum protein to be liquefied21,22. To compare the degree of liquefaction of the sputum, samples were placed into 15 mL tubes and photographed with an ordinary camera. From each sample was taken 100 \u03bcL to place in a well of a 96-well plate. These samples were observed under a microscope. The viscosity of the liquefied sputum was measured using the Mems & New paradigm for flow management (Rheosense, Inc., San Ramon, CA, USA) (Average n = 3\u20134 independent experiments per group). After each sample measurement, the device was cleaned more than 2 times in washing mode to prevent sample contamination. The data were analyzed using the Micro-ViSC program. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 600 nm using an Eppendorf BioSpectrometer kinetic (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) (n = 5\u20136 independent experiments per group). If the value was higher than the maximum value of 3 that can be displayed on the machine because of high absorbance, it was recorded as 3.",
