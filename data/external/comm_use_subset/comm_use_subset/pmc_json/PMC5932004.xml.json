The global incidence of this tropical disease has been estimated over 1 million cases of severe infection in human amounting to nearly 60,000 deaths annually3. It is caused by pathogenic species of Leptospira and can get transmitted to human by direct contact with reservoir hosts or via exposure to surface water or soil contaminated with their urine2,4. Both wild and domestic animals can serve as reservoir hosts of Leptospira; however, animals such as rodents, pigs, cows, dogs and horses are the most common hosts and sources of infection to humans. Leptospirosis is predominantly an occupational disease where agricultural workers, veterinarians and mineworkers are mainly at risk because of their exposure to contaminated water, soil and infected animals during their regular activities5. The clinical symptoms of leptospirosis in humans are diverse, ranging from mild fever, chills, flu-like illness, headache, muscle aches, to acute disease form known as Weil\u2019s syndrome6. The acute form is characterized by multiple organ complications, including acute renal and hepatic failure, cardiovascular collapse, jaundice, meningitis, pneumonitis and pulmonary haemorrhage, which in turn can lead to death7,8. Also, the disease has a major economic impact on the agricultural industry and companion animals, since it affects the livestock inducing abortions, infertility, stillbirths, reduced milk production and death, especially in developing countries8,9.",

The vaccination against leptospirosis in human populations may prove to be the most feasible approach for controlling the disease. Although, for over 100 years, whole cell inactivated and attenuated vaccines have been used for agricultural and companion animals and in some countries, also being used in human populations. But, due to their adverse effects, short-term immunity and insufficiency in inducing cross-protection, they have not been implemented globally10,11. Leptospira comprises more than 250 antigenically distinct serovars among pathogenic species12,13. This antigenic diversity of pathogenic Leptospira species makes up a challenge for the researchers to develop effective and cross-reactive vaccines.",

The current research for developing recombinant and subunit vaccines are mostly focused on leptospiral motility, outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and virulence factors15. These proteins have been recognized as playing major role in the interaction of pathogens with host cells and possibly associated with pathogenesis; hence, is the major focus of current vaccine research. Among these, significant protection in the hamster model has been reported with several outer membrane proteins, including LipL32 and the leptospiral immunoglobulin-like proteins (Lig)16\u201318. However, protective efficacy of these candidates was limited and also had failed to induce cross-protection and sterile immunity. Therefore, a highly conserved target that can stimulate both humoral and cell mediated immunity against leptospirosis is crucial for the development of an effective vaccine. The current status of leptospiral vaccine development demonstrates that there is an urgent need for the discovery of new effective vaccine candidates to provide immunity against majority of serovars18.",

Identifying the binding interaction between epitope and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is considered as the first step to vaccine design, as T-cell immunogenicity is correlated with the binding strength of epitopes and MHC molecule26. Therefore, these predicted epitopes were modelled and docked with MHC class I molecule and later on, their post-docking interaction analysis helped in the selection of optimal candidates for the development of peptide vaccines against leptospirosis.",

The results revealed the total length of protein as 717 amino acids with molecular weight of 73950.78 Daltons and theoretical Isoelectric point (PI) of 5.39 (Table 1). The instability index (II) was computed to be 32.21, which implies that the sequence of protein is stable. The sequence has about 59 negatively charged residues (Aspartic acid + Glutamic acid) and 48 positively charged residues (Arginine + Lysine). The amino-acid composition revealed that the protein has 10,261 atoms comprising Carbon (3181), Hydrogen (5058), Nitrogen (896), Oxygen (1121) and sulphur (5). The aliphatic index was calculated as 77.22. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was calculated to be negative (\u22120.328). This negative value indicates the hydrophilic nature of protein and most of the residues to be located on the surface; hence this protein tends to have better interaction with other proteins. The secondary structure analysis of protein revealed that the protein is dominated by random coils (55.09%) followed by extended strand (23.15%), alpha helix (12.69%) and beta turns (9.07%). The calculated secondary structure parameters are shown in Table 2 and a plot for each residue position versus its probability score for being in helix, strand, turn and coil in Fig. 1.",

C-score values measure similarity between the query and template based on the significance of threading template alignment and the query coverage parameters. Typically, C-score values lie in between [\u22125 to 2], where a higher value denotes a model with a higher confidence and correct topology. The top ranked 3D model yielded C-score value of 0.16 which indicates that the model is having a good topology. The structure of the top ranked model with its functional domain (LurC domain: 439 \u2212 661) is shown in Fig. 2(A). In addition to C-score, I-TASSER predicted up to ten closest structures in PDB and ranked them on the basis of TM-score and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions related to the best template used for 3D modelling. The closest protein structure and quality assessment parameters for the modelled structure are shown in Table 3. The top ranked model was refined using GalaxyRefine server34 and generated five refined models. Of these, the top ranked structure was selected on the basis of Ramachandran plot (80.3% in favoured region). Consequently, the quality of refined model was evaluated by using PROCHECK, ProSA-Web and ModFold6. PROCHECK calculates the steriochemical quality of the protein and depicted Ramachandran plot as shown in Fig. 2(B). The Ramachandran plot analysis of refined structure revealed that 80.3% of residues were located in most favoured region followed by 15.4% in allowed and 1.8% in generously allowed region, while only 2.5% of the residues were in disallowed region. However, ProSA-Web calculated Z-score of \u22122.97 indicating the model was not in the range of native protein conformation (Fig. 2(C)). Furthermore, the ModFold6 sever was used to evaluate the overall quality of the model (Table 3).",

The result revealed that the protein sequence of 717 aa has 26 antigenic peptides falling in the range of 6-22 amino acids length (Table 4). In addition, maximum residual score for each amino acid residue was also predicted. Out of 717 amino acids, 343 amino acids have residual score \u2265 1.008. Proline and Valine at the 400th and 401st positions, found in the antigenic peptide 394KYEVLLPVAAVPT406, was identified as having the highest antigenic residual score of 1.208. It should be noted that the epitopes 20MKKILILLIALSFAVFGCSHK40 and 42KGILLPFLTLLNQ54 were recognized as allergic to human; henceforward, they could not be considered as vaccine candidates. Fortunately, within 617WAILVPGA624 and 5YSSSFILIIKKG16 epitopes, some residues were also predicted as conformational as well as CTL epitopes, so can be considered as good candidates for peptide vaccine design. Moreover, the result indicated that the average antigenic propensity score of the predicted epitope was 1.008 while the minimum and maximum score was 0.855 and 1.208 respectively. The graphical representation of predicted antigenic residues based on the sequence position (X-axis) and antigenic propensity (y-axis) are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 (Supporting Information).

As a result, a total of 33 SB T-cell epitopes for the query sequence were predicted and are shown in Supplementary Dataset Table S3.

The analysis revealed that out of 11, only four predicted CTL epitopes (STVAYEDLY, ILVPGAWKY, QIGSIPFTY and KTALGSYPY) showed strong binding affinities in terms of global energy and attractive van der Waals energy (vdW) ranging from \u2013 61.00 to \u2212 48.99 kcal/mol and \u2212 28.32 to \u2212 23.35 kcal/mol respectively (Table 8 and Supplementary Table S4). Of these, three epitopes (STVAYEDLY, ILVPGAWKY and QIGSIPFTY) were found to contain antigenic amino acid residues, positive IEDB immunogenicity score and high degree of conservancy (Table 7). The presence of these properties can lead an epitope to be a promising peptide vaccine candidate. Moreover, seven epitopes (NSDSSSNAT, GTSYKDWYK, VSDNEGHIL, YSSSFILII, VTDLTTKTV, YLDSNNFPW and WVASNGTSY) have shown poor binding affinities in terms of global energy ranging from \u2013 39.30 to \u2013 15.27 kcal/mol as tabulated in the Supplementary Table S4. We found that the docking energies of aforementioned epitopes (lowest global energy \u201339.30 kcal/mol) are nowhere close to those of top three epitopes (STVAYEDLY, ILVPGAWKY and QIGSIPFTY; highest global energy \u201348.99 kcal/mol).",

Likewise, three hydrogen bonds were detected between ILVPGAWKY-HLA-A*0201, QIGSIPFTY-HLA-A*0201 and KTALGSYPY-HLA-A*0201 complex within a distance of 3.96, 2.869 and 3.85 \u00c5 respectively (Table 8 and Supplementary Table S4). Moreover, the reliability of the docked complex seems to be well-preserved by the formation of hydrogen bonds. Unfortunately, peptide STVAYEDLY, QIGSIPFTY and KTALGSYPY were not found to be binding in the binding groove of HLA-A*0201; while, ILVPGAWKY binds within the groove of HLA-A*0201. Overall analysis of the result showed that ILVPGAWKY epitope can be considered as a potential vaccine candidate for the epitope-driven vaccine design, as predicted to have lowest global energy and also binding within the groove of HLA-A*0201, which point out the stability of docked complex. In addition, this peptide was found to be conserved among 44 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira. Molecular interactions of the top three docked complexes with CTL-epitopes and HLA-A*0201 are shown in Fig. 4. The detailed analysis of other docked complexes is shown in supplementary Table S4. Further, the molecular interaction analysis of these predicted CTL epitopes (other eight CTL epitoes) docked to HLA-A*0201 protein are shown in supplementary Fig. S5. Also, the binding mode of each epitope to HLA-A*0201 proteins for all 11 complexes are shown in supplementary Fig. S6.

To overcome this disease burden, there is an urgent need of improved preventive measures against the disease. Vaccination is one of the most effective means to efficiently, rapidly and affordably improve the public health and the most feasible way to eradicate this infectious disease. The search for effective vaccines to prevent leptospirosis has been on-going for many decades15. Despite this, the development of broadly effective vaccines against leptospirosis remains desirable and yet challenging task due to the wide array of antigenic diversity among pathogenic species12. The currently available vaccines against leptospirosis consist of whole-cell inactivated and formalin-killed leptospires (bacterin). However, these vaccines often show severe side-effects and are unable to stimulate cross-protection against different serovars and hence, their efficacy is limited. Therefore, current vaccine research is mostly focused on peptide and subunit vaccines as compared to whole organism vaccines because subunit vaccines contain specific immunogenic components of the pathogens responsible for the infection rather than the whole pathogen, which may result in severe side-effects. In Leptospira, vaccine targets include OMPs, lipoproteins and transmembrane proteins. Indeed, the most promising vaccine candidate so far described is the surface protein Lig, while OM LipL32 is the most studied leptospiral protein15. However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates was limited and failed to induce cross-protective immunity. Therefore, the identification of other, more conserved, immunogenic OM proteins would be highly desirable for the development of cross-protective vaccine against leptospirosis. It is well-known that in Leptospira, OMPs exhibit high level of conservancy and are associated with pathogenesis; therefore, likely to be the most promising and successful candidates for peptide vaccines.",

            "text": "This study aims to screen and scrutinize the most antigenic OMP of the LIC, one of the most studied pathogenic Leptospira strains14, and to predict the possible antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes for epitope-based or peptide vaccine development by using in silico proteome wide-screening strategy. Several researchers have used in silico approach for identifying and designing of vaccine candidates45\u201350 and some of them achieved promising clinical trial results (for example ref.30). Screening using in vitro assays further reduces the number of vaccine candidates and hence, the number of laboratory animals required for efficacy testing. With immunoinformatics approaches, it is now feasible to screen the entire antigenic repertoire of a pathogen that could progress the discovery of potential vaccine candidates and may eventually improve existing vaccines. In our study, 21 proteins were predicted as highly immunogenic (antigenicity score > 1). Of these, two proteins (Q75FL0 and Q72PD2) were found to be located on the outer membrane. The Q72PD2 protein was annotated as hypothetical protein; hence, was excluded for further analysis. BLASTP analysis revealed that Q75FL0 is 100% identical to LruC domain-containing protein of LIC with 97% of query coverage and hence, may be characterised as LruC protein. The protein LruC was formerly described as leptospiral recurrent uveitis-associated protein C51,52. Experimentally, LruC protein was proven to be an OM lipoprotein and may have a role in pathogenesis of leptospiral Uveitis52. In addition, the LruC lipoprotein was found to be conserved among pathogenic Leptospira species. Thus, lipoprotein Q75FL0 could be the most promising new vaccine candidate for leptospirosis because of common and important features, including OM localization, conservation, and eliciting antibody production in patients52,53. Vaccination, or immunization works by stimulating antigen specific B-cells or CTLs and HTLs immune response. Consequently, B-cells, HTLs and CTLs epitope were predicted in the Q75FL0 lipoprotein. An effective peptide-based vaccine should contain both B-cell and T-cell epitopes to be able to elicit humoral and cellular immunity respectively. Several researchers have identified combined B-cell and T-cell epitopes of Leptospiral OMPs for diagnosis and vaccine purpose (see for example refs54,55). In our study, a number of peptides were predicted as comprising both B-cell and T-cell epitopes including 5YSSSFILIIKKG16, 301GSIPFTYNTVQTIPLNLVVTD321, 434AEGVSTVAYEDLYPSA449, 522TKTVSSSD529, 576LGSYPYDIFIKVI588 and 617WAILVPGA624, thus could induce humoral as well as cell mediated immunity and hence, can be considered for the development of peptide vaccines against leptospirosis. Furthermore, surface accessibility, surface flexibility as well as hydrophilicity for the B-cell epitopes have also been predicted in the current study. B-cell based vaccines provide antibody-mediated immunity which can be easily overwhelmed by surge of antigens. However, HTL plays a crucial role in inducing vital humoral or CTL responses and confer long-term immunity; hence, critical requirements for effective vaccine design. The response to T-cell epitopes is restricted by HLA proteins. HLAs are highly polymorphic i.e. the frequency of expression of different HLA types varies in different ethnic human populations. Therefore, to elicit broad immune responses in different human populations, the HLA specificity of T-cell epitopes must be considered as major criteria for screening of the epitopes56. Consequently, the epitope candidate should bind to the maximum number of HLA alleles to get more population coverage. Hence, in this study 10 HTL epitopes that bind to the maximum number of HLA alleles were selected as putative HTL epitope candidates. The main adaptive immunity against bacteria was thought to be primarily humoral i.e. mediated by B-cell or CD4+ cell8. However, humoral immunity is not far enough to completely clean the infection, cell-mediated immunity is needed to induce cell death and completely destroy the bacterial habitat. Although pathogenic Leptospira is not considered as a typical intracellular pathogen, indeed some bacterial proteins may be able to escape from the phagolysosome and reach to the cytosol of host cells and are exposed to the host CD8+ T-cells response, as reviewed in ref.57. Though, recent studies have reported that cell-mediated immunity is involved in the protective immune response stimulated by the Leptospira pathogen or vaccines58,59. In the current study, one of the CD8+ restricted CTL epitope, 619ILVPGAWKY627 having high degree of conservancy among 46 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira, has also been predicted as antigenic site of linear B-cell and showing significant binding interaction with HLA-A*0201 protein; thus, considerably enhancing the possibility of this peptide to be a vaccine candidate. As per our knowledge, this immunoinformatics study represents novel vaccine candidates that will further aid in the development of improved vaccines for leptospirosis.",

ProtParam tool allows the computation of various parameters that decide the stability and functional characteristics of the protein to some extent and SOPMA computes the secondary structural features of the protein. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of outer membrane lipoprotein were predicted using the I-TASSER server33,63. I-TASSER generated five alternative 3D models of protein and assigned confidence score (C-score) for each model that infers the quality of the structure. The modelled protein with the highest C-score was refined and subjected for its quality assessment. The 3D model was refined by using GalaxyRefine server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/). This server refines the modelled structure by reconstructing side-chain conformations followed by repacking and dynamics simulations to repeatedly relax the structure. GalaxyRefine has been evaluated as one of the best method to improve the local quality of the structure. This server can improve local and global quality of the models generated by structure prediction servers such as I-TASSER. Furthermore, to evaluate the refined model, quality assessment of the model was done by using three different servers viz. PROCHECK64, ProSA-Web65,66, and ModFold667. PROCHECK was used to analyse the stereochemical quality of the model by evaluating the Ramachandran plot of the protein structure; whereas, ProSA-Web and ModFold evaluated the overall quality of the model. ProSA-Web calculated the overall quality score of the model by analysing their atomic coordinates which is frequently employed in protein tertiary structure validation. ModFold calculates the p-value and assign a degree of confidence (poor, low, medium, high and cert) of the model depending on the p-value. The 3D structure of protein was visualized using PyMol68.",
