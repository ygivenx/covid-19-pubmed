This assumption, that the genetic background will not affect functional consequence, is not necessarily true; if a recombination event were to occur within a gene (joining the sequence of two different founders into the same gene in a CC strain) and was upstream of some variant, that variant might no longer have the same effect. Nonetheless, our assumption is mostly reasonable: given the relatively small number of recombinations per CC line\u2014on average 135 (Srivastava et al. 2017)\u2014the number of midgene recombinations is necessarily small, and an even smaller number of these recombinations will actually have an effect on downstream variants.

With regard to completeness, in the generations since the MRCAs, additional mutations have accumulated and, thanks to the extremely small effective population size within each CC strain, rapidly become fixed. Sequencing results suggest that the number of variants now segregating in the CC has increased by 2% since the MRCA generation. (Srivastava et al. 2017). Similarly, many of the regions harboring residual heterozygosity in the MRCA animals have by now become fixed. Regarding the precision of the imputation itself, the ability to construct the underlying haplotype mosaic is limited by, among other things, the resolution of the MegaMUGA genotyping array (or of any array), and particularly how well that array can mitigate the inherent difficulties arising with inferring haplotype state at recombination breakpoints and regions of identity-by-descent between founders. Our imputed variants thus reflect an incomplete and uncertain view of the current generation\u2019s CC genomes.",

Nonetheless, since sequencing is limited to a single animal per strain, it does not by itself provide a definitive answer genome-wide, largely due to residual heterozygosity.
