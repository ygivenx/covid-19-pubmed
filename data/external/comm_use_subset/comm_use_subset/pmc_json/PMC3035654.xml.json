            "text": "Eukaryotic viruses have evolved a variety of translational control strategies to facilitate expression of downstream open reading frames (ORFs) on polycistronic mRNAs and examples have been described at all three steps of protein synthesis - initiation, elongation and termination [1]. These include leaky scanning of 40S ribosomal subunits past the most 5\u2032 AUG [2], the de novo recruitment of ribosomes to intercistronic internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs; [3]); programmed ribosomal frameshifting [4], [5] and the circumvention of normal termination by programmed stop codon readthrough [6], [7]. Generally, these processes allow the expression of two (or more) proteins from a single mRNA and may also permit a level of control over their relative quantities. Another way of accessing a downstream ORF in viral mRNAs is by termination-dependent reinitiation of translation (termination-reinitiation), a phenomenon first described in the expression of the influenza B virus BM2 protein [8]. The dicistronic mRNA that is derived from genomic segment 7 of this virus has two ORFs encoding matrix protein 1 (M1) and BM2, with the termination codon of M1 in close proximity to the start codon of the BM2 ORF (UAA\nUG; stop codon of M1 in bold, start codon of BM2 underlined) [8]\u2013[10]. Following translation of M1, some 10\u201320% of ribosomes terminating at the M1 stop codon go on to reinitiate translation at the immediately adjacent BM2 start codon [8], [11]. This capacity to reinitiate protein synthesis following translation of a long upstream ORF was unexpected. During the elongation phase, initiation factors are likely to be rapidly lost, thus reinitiation of translation following termination was believed to be restricted to cases where the upstream ORF (uORF) is very short [12]\u2013[14]. Our knowledge of the mRNA signals that allow efficient reinitiation following translation of a long upstream ORF has largely been obtained from studies of caliciviruses, namely in the expression of the VP2 protein of feline calicivirus (FCV; [15]\u2013[17]) and the VP10 protein of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV; [18], [19]). Here, expression of the downstream ORF by termination-reinitiation requires a stretch of mRNA (between 69 and 87 nt in length) upstream of the stop codon of the first ORF (termed the termination upstream ribosome binding site or TURBS) and the close proximity of the stop and start codons of the two ORFs [15], [17], [19]. Within the TURBS, two essential sequence motifs (motifs 1 and 2) have been described. Motif 1 is highly conserved amongst caliciviruses and is composed of a short stretch of 6\u20139 nt (with a conserved core of UGGGA) with complementarity to the apical loop of helix 26 of 18S rRNA. This motif, which lies towards the 5\u2032 boundary of the TURBS, likely acts to tether the 40S subunit to the mRNA post-termination, facilitating the recruitment of the initiation factors necessary for reinitiation [15], [19]. Motif 2, which lies some 15\u201320 nt upstream of the termination-reinitiation window (AUG\nA in FCV), is a second essential stretch of 4\u20138 nt but shows little sequence conservation amongst caliciviruses. Recent work has revealed that this motif in fact forms the 3\u2032 arm of a stem-loop structure whose formation is necessary for efficient termination-reinitiation [16].",

            "text": "The features identified in caliciviral TURBS suggest a model for termination-reinitiation in which post-termination 40S subunits are tethered to the mRNA through interactions between the mRNA (through motif 1) and 18S rRNA, initiation factors are recruited and the AUG restart codon located, processes which may require precise RNA folding (involving motif 2) within the TURBS. The TURBS is not highly active as an IRES and 40S subunit recruitment probably requires high local 40S subunit concentrations [17], [18]. An important question, therefore, is how the interaction between TURBS motif 1 and 18S rRNA helix 26 is facilitated. Analysis of primary and secondary structural features of the BM2 signal has revealed that it contains a short TURBS (of 45 nt) which is largely single-stranded, with motif 1 likely to be located in the apical loop of a metastable stem-loop structure when the ribosome is positioned at the termination codon of the upstream ORF [11]. We have suggested that motif 1 may thus be \u201cpresented\u201d to the solvent-accessible apical loop of helix 26, promoting the interaction and subsequent 40S tethering. However, this hypothesis remains contentious. The paucity of stable RNA secondary structure within the BM2 TURBS [11], the TURBS of FCV [I. Brierley, unpublished observations] and the calicivirus murine norovirus (MNV; [20]), limits the predictive power of RNA folding programs in the assessment of the likely RNA folds present before and after ribosomal transit through the TURBS. It is also known that eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) plays a role in the termination-reinitiation process, perhaps interacting with the TURBS to provide another link between mRNA and the 40S subunit [17].",

In contrast to the caliciviral TURBS, which contain stretches of non-essential bases between motifs 1 and 2, all of the BM2 TURBS appears to be required for function perhaps due to its shorter length, with sequence-specific and sequence-independent elements. Evidence is provided, from oligonucleotide targeting and from expression studies in yeast cells, to support the hypothesis that BM2 motif 1 interacts directly with helix 26 of 18S rRNA, consistent with a tethering role. We also provide evidence that a close spacing between the M1 stop and BM2 start codons is not critical; rather, there is dependence upon the distance between the terminating ribosome and the TURBS. Indeed, the ribosome is able to locate start codons placed some distance downstream of the wild-type position if termination occurs at the normal distance relative to the TURBS. The role of RNA secondary structure in TURBS function was also investigated by mutagenesis, but the experiments gave only limited support for the predicted secondary structures. However, the capacity of eIF3 to stimulate termination-reinitiation, particularly from a defective TURBS, was confirmed, including a TURBS rendered defective through a point mutation in motif 1. Together, these data support the view that efficient termination-reinitiation requires both mRNA-rRNA interactions and the participation of eIF3.",

However, given that the minimal sequence requirement for termination-reinitiation of BM2 (\u223c45 nt; [11]) is shorter than that documented in the caliciviruses (69 and 87 nt; [15], [17], [19]), we wished to test whether any of the residues were non-essential. To do this, we introduced 6 nt deletions throughout the length of the sequence upstream of the M1 termination codon in the context of the BM2 termination-reinitiation reporter plasmid, p2luc-BM2-204 (Figure 1A; [11]). As expected, translation of the BM2-204 reporter mRNA generated products corresponding to the cap-dependent upstream product (rlucM1-204 \u223c36 kDa) and the termination-reinitiation product (BM2fluc \u223c62 kDa). The latter protein was not observed in translations of the negative control reporter mRNA, p2luc-BM2ps (rluc'M1 \u223c33 kDa, [11]), which contains an in-frame stop codon immediately upstream of the TURBS. Significantly, deletion of any part of the minimal required region led to a strong inhibition of BM2fluc synthesis, suggesting that the entire TURBS is required for efficient termination-reinitiation on the segment 7 RNA (Figure 1A). Alternatively, it was possible that the defect in BM2 synthesis in this deletion series may be a consequence of the altered spacing between the M1 stop codon and upstream features required for termination-reinitiation. To test this, we selected three of the 6 nt deletion mutants surrounding motif 1 (mutants 6.1, 6.4 and 6.6) and replaced the deleted regions with two different random 6 nt sequences (Figure 1B). No restoration of BM2 synthesis was observed with either of the 6.1 nucleotide replacement mutants (Figure 1B). Replacement of nucleotides into the 6.4 deletion mutant had no effect with the first of the mutants (6.4r1), but some recovery was observed in the second of these mutants (6.4r2), albeit the frequency of termination-reinitiation was diminished compared to that of the wild-type mRNA (Figure 1B). In contrast, insertion of 6 nt back into the 6.6 deletion mutant fully restored BM2 synthesis in both cases (Figure 1B). These results suggest that the minimal 45 nt TURBS region is split into both sequence-specific and sequence-independent elements, where the sequence towards the 5\u2032 end of the minimal region is important in base-specific interactions, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the TURBS may act solely as a spacer, important in placing motif 1 relative to the terminating ribosome.",

            "text": "Termination-reinitiation on the BM2 ORF is likely to be dependent on interactions between the influenza B segment 7 RNA and helix 26 of the 18S rRNA [11]. However, other work has revealed that motif 1 may also be important in eIF3 binding [17]. To investigate the mRNA-18S rRNA interaction further, antisense 2-O-methyl oligonucleotides (AONs) were synthesised that would target either the loop of helix 26 of 18S rRNA (Figure 2A) or motif 1 of the BM2 TURBS (Figure 2B). Control oligonucleotides were also prepared to target sequences both upstream and downstream of motif 1 to control for potential non-specific effects on translation (Figure 2B). An AON designed to target helix 26 of the 18S rRNA had no effect on BM2 synthesis (Figure 2A), although high concentrations (320-fold to 2960-fold molar excess of the AON to the mRNA) inhibited global translation (Figure 2A and data not shown). Conversely, an AON targeting motif 1 specifically inhibited BM2 synthesis, with little effect on overall translation (Figure 2B). Importantly, the upstream and downstream control AONs had little effect on BM2 synthesis or global translation within the range tested for the BM2 motif 1 complementary AON (Figure 2B). It should be noted that the 80S ribosome will strip annealed AONs from the mRNA as it translates through the TURBS. However, both the upstream and motif 1 complementary AONs will be able to re-anneal once the ribosome reaches the UAA\nUG. However, it is possible that any effect of the downstream oligo is masked due to it being unable to reanneal in the presence of the terminating ribosome. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the effect of the BM2 motif 1 complementary AON is specific and not an effect on ribosome processivity, and provide further evidence in support of an interaction between motif 1 and 18S rRNA. However, we cannot rule out that these effects may also be due to perturbations of RNA secondary structure within the TURBS or due to interactions of motif 1 with an unspecified molecule (see later).",

As a precedent for this, the murine Gtx mRNA (also known as Nkx 6-2) contains a short 9 nt IRES element that is known to act more efficiently when present in multiple copies. Similarly to motif 1, ribosomes are recruited through interactions between the Gtx IRES and helix 26 of the 18S rRNA [28]\u2013[30], although with the arm of the helix [31] rather than the apical loop (Figure 3C, left panel). Two sets of constructs were prepared. In the first, one or two additional copies of the 6 nt (AUGGGA) core of motif 1 were introduced alongside the original (Figure 3B). Control constructs were also generated in which one or two copies of the hexanucleotide AUGCGA were looped in as a negative control, since this motif 1 mutation was shown previously to be unable to support termination-reinitiation, presumably due to the abolition of mRNA:rRNA base pairing [11]. In the second set of constructs, the bases downstream of the wild-type AUGGGA sequence were substituted to generate one or two extra copies of the AUGGGA motif (Figure 3B). In vitro translations revealed, however, that none of the mutations had a stimulatory effect on reinitiation on the BM2 ORF. Looping in a single extra copy of the AUGGGA (or AUGCGA) hexanucleotide had very little effect on the process, whilst insertion of two copies led to inhibition in both contexts (Figure 3B). In constructs where motif 1 was duplicated by virtue of nucleotide substitutions, termination-reinitiation was inhibited to a similar extent in constructs containing either one or two copies of the 18S complementary motif (Figure 3B). These data indicate that there is no additive effect on termination-reinitiation of adding extra copies of the 18S complementary region. In fact, the inhibitory effects seen most likely reflect the importance of the precise spacing of the ribosome with respect to motif 1 (in the loop-in mutants) or, alternatively, some effect on TURBS RNA secondary structure.",

Two constructs were generated, one in which the inserted Gtx element was complementary to murine 18S rRNA (which would result in a mismatch with helix 26 of rabbit 18S rRNA) and one with full complementarity to the rabbit 18S rRNA, such that efficient tethering would be expected in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL; Figure 3C, top-right panel). Termination-reinitiation was found to be inhibited in either mutant and to a similar extent as mutants in which a single nucleotide substitution was present to abolish 18S rRNA:mRNA base pairing (Figure 3C; the single nucleotide mutants have been described previously [11]).

In an attempt to resolve this issue, we assayed termination-reinitiation in yeast cells, whose 18S rRNA helix 26 equivalent has a somewhat different primary sequence. This experiment was carried out in the context of the yeast dual reporter vector pAC99, into which we had cloned the relevant BM2 information appropriately framed between \u03b2-galactosidase and firefly luciferase reporter genes. In pAC99-BM2wt, \u03b2-galactosidase is synthesised by cap-dependent translation, whereas firefly luciferase should only be synthesised following reinitiation on the BM2fluc ORF (Figure 4A). To confirm that firefly luciferase was being synthesised as a result of a genuine termination-reinitiation event (as opposed to internal ribosome entry, for example), we generated a premature stop (ps) mutant (pAC99-BM2-ps) in which a stop codon was inserted into the M1 sequence 233 nt upstream of the start codon of BM2fluc. In pAC99-BM2-yeast, motif 1 was changed to give full complementarity to the yeast 18S rRNA partner (Figure 4B). The plasmids were transformed into yeast strain Y349, and \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase assays were carried out. Termination-reinitiation frequency was determined in comparison to the reporter gene activities observed in a vector in which the reporter ORFs were fused in-frame (pAC99-BM2IFC). As expected, termination reinitiation was significantly (p<0.01) reduced in pAC99-yeast-ps, although there was still some background synthesis of fluc (Figure 4C). Importantly, mutation of the motif 1 homologue such that it was fully complementary to yeast 18S rRNA led to a significant (p<0.01) increase in BM2fluc synthesis relative to the wild-type BM2 reporter (Figure 4C), supporting the view that mRNA:rRNA base pairing is a key determinant in BM2 ORF expression.",

Indeed, movement of the M1 stop codon more than 24 nt downstream of its original context in the termination-reinitiation \u2018window\u2019 of the BM2 signal results in inhibition of reinitiation on the BM2 ORF [11]. However, in all previous investigations into proximity effects of the start and stop codons, the termination site was moved downstream of the start codon of the upstream ORF [8], [11], [15], [17]\u2013[19], [32]). Given that termination-reinitiation almost certainly depends on interactions between the terminating ribosome and the TURBS, it is conceivable that these experiments have overestimated the importance of the relative proximity of the stop and start codons and that the distance between the terminating ribosome and the TURBS is the crucial issue. To investigate this, a series of mRNAs were prepared in which the UAA\nUG overlap was moved downstream en masse such that the distance between the stop and start codons was conserved but the ribosome would terminate at varying distances relative to the TURBS (Figure 5B). A series of control mRNAs were also examined in which the stop codon alone was shifted downstream of the BM2 start codon (Figure 5A; details in [11]). In all constructs, nucleotides at \u20133 and +4 relative to the BM2fluc AUG were maintained to control for context effects of the start codon. As observed previously in the control series [11], reinitiation occurred efficiently when the stop codon was moved up to 24 nt downstream of its original placement but was abolished when the stop was moved further (Figure 5A). Importantly, BM2 translation followed the same pattern in mRNAs where the UAA\nUG motif was moved as a unit, with ablation of synthesis observed when this sequence was moved any further than 24 nt downstream of its original site (Figure 5B). These experiments reveal that the placement of the 40S subunit relative to the TURBS, post-termination, is quite critical.",

A series of mRNAs were prepared in which the original BM2fluc start codon was mutated to AGC and new AUG restart codons inserted independently at +12, +24, +36, +48 and +63 nt, again preserving the wild-type Kozak consensus. As can be seen in Figure 6A, movement of the start codon to +12 resulted in 50% inhibition of fluc synthesis, but there was no further reduction in product yield when the restart codon was displaced further downstream. However, the electrophoretic mobility of this reinitiation product did not show the clear increase that would be expected given that the restart product would become progressively smaller with increased displacement of the restart codon. Rather, the reinitiation product band seemed less sharp and more diffuse with the +48 and +63 mRNAs. This suggested the possibility that reinitiation might be occurring at two sites: one in the region of the wild-type reinitiation site (and so necessarily at a non-AUG codon), and the other at the displaced AUG restart codon.",

We therefore tested whether reinitiation can indeed occur at this -1 position, by generating an AUG in this position and removing the wild-type +1 AUG. The results showed that the efficiency of reinitiation at an AUG in the -1 position was similar to when it was in the normal (+1) position (Figure 6B, compare lanes 8 and 10), in agreement with the finding that reinitiation efficiency in the RHDV system was only slightly compromised if the restart codon was moved one codon upstream [19]. Given that quite efficient reinitiation still occurs in FCV and BM2 RNAs when the wild-type AUG is mutated to non-AUG codons [11], [15], [17], this observation suggests that when the wild-type +1 AUG has been mutated, there is a strong possibility of some reinitiation occurring at the -1 AUA codon.",

In fact, in this particular experiment there is much more downstream cistron product from the displaced AUG than product from the putative -1 AUA reinitiation site, which was only just visible on the autoradiogram (highlighted by the asterisk). In reviewing the results of many experiments of this type we conclude that the relative use of the two potential reinitiation sites shows quite a large degree of variability, which seems related to the use of different batches of reticulocyte lysate and so may possibly be due to small batch to batch differences in the endogenous ionic conditions. The variability seems to mainly affect the yield of putative -1 AUA reinitiation product, whereas the yield of product from the displaced AUG codon is relatively invariant at \u223c20% of the wild-type mRNA yield. The two extremes of the variability range are well illustrated by Figure 6B (very minimal use of the -1 AUA site) and Figure 6C, where there is actually more putative reinitiation at the -1 AUA than at the displaced AUG codon.",

We examined this by exploiting the dependence of ribosomal scanning on eIF4G [34]. The BM2wt and BM2start +63 mRNAs were modified such that translation of the upstream M1 ORF was driven by the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES, which does not require eIF4G for function. These mRNAs (CrPV-BM2wt, CrPV-BM2start+63) were then translated alongside capped brome mosaic virus RNAs (BMV, Promega) and BM2wt RNAs (as a control for the efficacy of eIF4G depletion) in mock- and eIF4G-depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Figure 6C). Translations were also performed in the absence or presence of dominant-negative eIF4A (eIF4A R362Q [35]) to inhibit the activity of any residual eIF4G that had escaped depletion. As expected, the translation of the capped wild-type RNA (BM2wt) and BMV RNAs were inhibited in the eIF4G-depleted RRL, but the CrPV IRES-containing mRNAs were translated efficiently in both control and depleted RRL (Figure 6C). Importantly, depletion of eIF4G had no effect on the reinitiation efficiency in either the CrPV-BM2wt or CrPV-BM2start +63 mRNAs, suggesting that the reinitiation site can be located in a scanning-independent manner.",

Thus the strongly preferred site for reinitiation is an AUG codon just downstream of the TURBS. If there is no AUG in this region, the reinitiation mechanism apparently seeks alternatives: either an acceptable non-AUG codon in this same region or an AUG codon further downstream. Reinitiation in the later case does not involve eIF4G/4A-dependent linear scanning, and so it is more likely to involve a direct transfer of the 40S subunit from the TURBS to the AUG, a transfer which might be facilitated by looping out the mRNA between the tethered 40S ribosomal subunit and the AUG.",

Furthermore, greater stimulation is observed with mRNAs that show a partial defect in reinitiation in the absence of eIF3, suggesting that the increase in eIF3 concentration may rescue the negative phenotype, perhaps by allowing increased binding of eIF3 to the mRNA [17]. To analyse whether the same is true of reinitiation on the BM2 ORF, we examined the effect of exogenous eIF3 on reinitiation on mRNAs containing a fully functional signal (BM2wt, BM2-204), or mutants defective by virtue of a deletion (BM2-207, BM2-210, described in [11]) or a substitution in motif 1 (BM2-AG, BM2-AC). To focus specifically on the effect of eIF3 on termination-reinitiation rather than 5\u2032-dependent initiation, the BM2 sequences were sub-cloned such that the rlucM1 ORF would initiate on an alanine codon provided as part of the CrPV IRES. As can be seen in Figure 7, exogenous eIF3 specifically stimulated synthesis of the BM2fluc reinitiation product with all of the mRNAs tested, including those mutants that were essentially inactive (BM2-210 and BM2-AC; most evident in long exposures, see right panel, Figure 7). Importantly, the addition of an unrelated, similarly purified protein had no effect on reinitiation in any of the RNAs described above (Figure S1), further highlighting the specificity of eIF3\u2032s effect on reinitiation.",

To test this hypothesis we created destabilising mutations within either arm of stem 2 (chosen to avoid disruption of the 18S rRNA complementary region) in the context of the p2luc-BM2-204 parental plasmid (which encodes the minimal required region for termination-reinitiation [11]). The mutations created were of either 2 or 3 nt to control for context effects on the BM2 AUG, creating the arm 1 mutants p2luc-BM2A1-xnt, and the arm 2 mutants p2luc-BM2A2-xnt (where x =  the number of nucleotides mutated). We also prepared double mutants (A1/2-xnt) to create a pseudowild-type structure where base-pairing between the two arms is restored. In the context of both the 2 nt and 3 nt mutations, substitution of bases in arm 1 abolished termination-reinitiation, however substitution of the bases at the bottom of arm 2 had little effect on BM2fluc synthesis relative to the BM2-204 control. The double pseudowild-type mutation also demonstrated abolition of BM2fluc expression (Figure 8A). Taken together these results suggest that the structure presented in mfold 1 is unlikely to play a role in termination-reinitiation as disruption of arm 2 of stem 2 has little effect on BM2 translation, and no restoration of BM2 synthesis was observed in the pseudowild-type construct.",

We tested this structure in the same way, by introducing destabilising mutations independently in both arms at the base of stem 2\u2032 (creating mutants p2luc-BM2A1' and p2luc-BM2A2\u2032) and preparing a double mutant that would yield a pseudowild-type structure, which would be expected to exhibit BM2fluc synthesis (p2luc-BM2A1\u2032/2\u2032). It should be noted that the A1\u2032 mutation is very similar to that of the A1-2/3 nt mutant, given that this arm base pairs to form both stem 2 and stem 2\u2032 in the two putative folds. As expected, this mutation dramatically inhibited synthesis of BM2fluc similarly to that observed with the A1 mutation (Figure 8B). However, as before, no inhibition of BM2 synthesis was observed when stem 2 was destabilised in the 3\u2032 arm (Figure 8B). Nevertheless, the partial restoration of BM2 expression (to around 50% of wild-type) seen with the A1\u2032/2\u2032 double mutant, indicates that base-pairing in this region may play some role in termination-reinitiation. The simplest conclusion from these experiments, however, is that neither mfold 1 nor mfold 2 represent the sole active confirmation, although it is possible that these mutants may form another structure that can present the TURBS motif 1 to helix 26 of 18S rRNA.",

            "text": "Previous work has revealed that termination-dependent reinitiation on the BM2 ORF of segment 7 of influenza B virus is dependent on a relatively short (45 nt), largely unstructured, TURBS containing a typical motif 1 element towards the 5\u2032 end [11]. In the present study, we investigated features of the TURBS required for efficient reinitiation, focusing primarily on the proposed interaction between TURBS motif 1 and helix 26 of 18S rRNA. Whilst the effects of point mutations within motif 1 are consistent with such an interaction, direct evidence is lacking in the BM2 system. We began by attempting to block the interaction by targeting the binding partners with antisense oligonucleotides. Such an approach was successfully employed in studies of the IRES-like properties of the Gtx leader (which recruits ribosomes de novo by virtue of interactions between the 18S rRNA and the mRNA) and revealed that the IRES activity could be blocked by AONs that bind either the mRNA or the rRNA [36]. Whilst we were able to observe specific inhibitory effects with an oligonucleotide that targeted motif 1, no effect was observed with an oligonucleotide targeting the ribosomal RNA (Figure 2). Our failure to observe an effect of the AON complementary to the apical loop of helix 26 may be due to a failure of the AON to access the target. The Gtx mRNA:rRNA interaction occurs at a different region of helix 26 than the putative segment 7 mRNA:rRNA interaction, and this may be more accessible. Indeed, termination-reinitiation could not be reconstituted in reporter mRNAs in which motif 1 was replaced by the Gtx 18S rRNA binding motif (Figure 3C), and thus different responses to oligonucleotides targeting the rRNA may be expected. It may also be that the 18S rRNA-targeting oligonucleotide may need to adopt a similar structure to the mRNA if it is to effectively bind to the 18S rRNA and block reinitiation. The inhibition of termination-reinitiation by the AON that targeted motif 1, in contrast, is highly consistent with its proposed role in binding to helix 26, although effects via RNA conformation or binding to an unknown molecule cannot be ruled out. However, the weight of evidence from mutational analysis, the yeast data described below and the AON titrations strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of AONs directed against motif 1 are likely due to their blocking of the interaction between mRNA and 18S rRNA.",

Using a dicistronic reporter mRNA with variant motif 1 sequences, we found that increasing the complementarity of the motif to that of yeast 18S rRNA stimulated termination-reinitiation, supporting strongly the view that intermolecular interactions are important in reinitiation on the BM2 ORF. However, two aspects of this experiment require comment. First, a high background activity was observed in control assays (Figure 4), the origin of which is uncertain Secondly, in yeast cells, the BM2wt reporter mRNA, whose motif 1 is not fully complementary to the helix 26 target, showed an efficiency of termination-reinitiation only two-fold lower than the BM2yeast mRNA. In RRL, a single base mismatch between mRNA and rRNA is sufficient to inhibit BM2 synthesis 10-20 fold [11]. One possible explanation for this difference is that the higher concentrations of mRNA and rRNA in an intact cell can act to stabilise the (presumably) weakened mRNA:rRNA interaction. During preparation of this manuscript, Luttermann and Meyers (2009) published a similar, more sophisticated, investigation of FCV motif 1:18S rRNA interactions using a yeast expression system in which both mRNA and rRNA partners could be modified. This work provided strong evidence in support of a requirement for mRNA:rRNA interactions in termination-reinitiation in the expression of FCV VP2 [16].",

This, in turn, implies that the ribosome which has just terminated at the stop codon must dissociate into subunits prior to reinitiation, in order to allow eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi ternary complex binding to the 40S subunit. So it is a 40S subunit rather than an 80S ribosome that interacts with TURBS motif 1. The fact that reinitiation efficiency decreases quite abruptly with increasing distance of displacement of the stop codon further downstream (Figure 5) favours a model in which this 40S subunit is transferred directly from the termination site to the TURBS, rather than dissociating from the mRNA after termination followed by reassociation with the TURBS.",

At low (sub-optimal) Mg2+, this disassembly requires eIF1 and eIF3, but no other protein factor. First, eIF3 binds to the solvent face of the 40S subunit, promoting dissociation of the 60S subunit, and leaving the 40S subunit (with bound deacylated tRNA) still associated with the mRNA. Then eIF1 ejects the deacylated tRNA, while the eIF3j subunit promotes dissociation of the 40S/eIF1/eIF3 complex from the mRNA [37]. At higher, more physiologically relevant Mg2+, as would pertain in our translation assays, there is also a requirement for ABCE1 and ATP [38], which catalyses the first step of dissociation of the ribosomal subunits, ejecting the 60S subunit and again leaving the 40S subunit (plus bound deacylated tRNA) still associated with the mRNA. Then eIF3 binds to the solvent face of the 40S subunit, thereby preventing any ribosomal subunit reassociation, and events thereafter are exactly as at low Mg2+\n[37], [38].",

More important, supplementary eIF3 has been shown to stimulate reinitiation at the wild-type FCV TURBS, but more especially at TURBS derivatives which are partially defective due to deletions or point mutations [17], just as has been observed here (Figure 7). These results, particularly the stimulation of the partially defective TURBS, have suggested a model in which it is specifically the eIF3 associated with the TURBS that binds those 40S subunits which are destined to reinitiate translation [17]. There is no conflict between this hypothesis and the model in which tethering the 40S subunit to the TURBS is due to base-pairing between TURBS motif 1 and 18S rRNA. eIF3 binds predominantly to the back or solvent face of the 40S ribosomal subunit, and is known to make direct contacts with the 18S rRNA component of the small ribosomal subunit [39], [40]. A bridging interaction in which eIF3 binds simultaneously to the 40S subunit and to the TURBS could help stabilise the binding of the 40S subunit to the TURBS for sufficient time as is required to acquire an eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi ternary complex, and other necessary initiation factors. After all, the analogous Shine-Dalgarno interaction of prokaryotic 30S subunits is generally considered to be very transitory unless it is accompanied and stabilised by a P-site fMet-tRNA base-pairing with an AUG (or GUG) at an appropriate distance further downstream.",

            "text": "An important question that remains to be resolved is whether there is a role for TURBS RNA secondary structure. We previously proposed that the TURBS may fold into two main configurations, in the first of which (mfold 1) motif 1 is sequestered in a base-paired region [11], which may explain why it does not have significant IRES activity (as is seen with Gtx [28]\u2013[30]). Translation through and termination at the M1 ORF would remodel mfold 1 to a structure similar to that shown in mfold 2 (Figure 8B) such that motif 1 would then be presented to the 18S rRNA on the apical loop of a stem-loop structure. The experiments described in Figure 1 agree well with dependence on a structure similar to that presented in mfold 2, in that the substituted nucleotides in the 6.1 and 6.4 replacement mutants would act to disrupt the stem, whereas substitution of nucleotides in the 6.6 replacement mutants would be expected to have no effect as they would lie within the mRNA channel of the terminating ribosome. However, we also carried out a mutational analysis of the main stem regions present in mfold 1 and mfold 2 but the data did not corroborate our structural predictions. Whilst disruption of either of the putative stems in one arm inhibited reinitiation, little effect was observed when stem formation was disrupted in arm 2 of either stem-loop structure, although some restoration of BM2 synthesis was observed in an mRNA containing a pseudowild-type mfold 2 structure. It should be noted that RNA structure mapping of the TURBS of BM2 [11], FCV (Brierley et al. unpublished observations) and MNV [20] TURBS reveals that they are largely single-stranded, and probably metastable. It may be that TURBS are able to adopt a variety of conformations, some of which are able to facilitate termination-reinitiation, for example the 6 nt replacement mutant 6.4r2 (Figure 1B). Alternatively, the requirement for translation through the TURBS may not be due to a dependence on translational remodelling and \u2018unzipping\u2019 of motif 1 from paired regions, but rather just to place the ribosome in proximity to motif 1 (similar to the case for reinitiation in bacteriophage where the ribosome is placed close to the vestigial Shine-Dalgarno [SD] motif [41]). It is clear that further work is required to understand the putative role of RNA secondary structure in termination-reinitiation.",

            "text": "Previous studies on the termination-reinitiation process have suggested the importance of the close proximity of the stop codon of the upstream ORF and the start codon of the downstream ORF [8], [11], [15], [17], [18], [32]. This is believed to reflect a restricted mobility of the tethered ribosome; that is, it may be able to undergo only limited movement following termination. However, we show here that the distance between the terminating ribosome and the TURBS is more critical to reinitiation efficiency (Figure 5) and that when the start codon of the BM2 ORF is placed downstream of the stop codon, reinitiation is detectable even when the start codon is moved up to 63nt downstream of its original position (Figure 6). This suggests that it is not solely the distance between the start and stop codons per se that affects reinitiation efficiency but rather how well the ribosome can be tethered (by virtue of the distance between where the ribosome terminates and the TURBS). However, whilst efficient reinitiation requires an AUG at, or very near, the wild-type site (Figure 6A and 6B), other reinitiation sites can be used when the native reinitiation codon is absent, albeit at lower efficiency. Under the latter circumstance, ribosomes can reinitiate at a downstream AUG codon (Figure 6B), or at a near-cognate initiation codon (such as the -1 AUA codon, Figure 6) close to the native reinitiation site. However, if given a choice of a wild-type AUG and one located downstream, the ribosome always selects the wild-type AUG, even if the ribosome artificially terminates downstream of the reinitiation window (Figure 6B), suggesting that the TURBS may cause the tethered 40S subunit to \u2018snap back\u2019 to the proper site of reinitiation. Importantly, we show that there is no requirement for eIF4G in location of either wild-type or downstream reinitiation sites. As such, location of downstream AUGs is likely due to the 40S subunit being transferred directly to the AUG whilst tethered to the TURBS (perhaps in complex with eIF3 and other factors) by an RNA-looping mechanism.",
