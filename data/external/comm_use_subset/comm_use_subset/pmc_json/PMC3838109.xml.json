Expression of the interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) genes (new members of the ISG family) restricts the replication of several highly pathogenic human viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, filoviruses (Marburg virus and Ebola virus), influenza A viruses (IAVs), and flaviviruses (dengue virus) (1, 2). Although restriction of HIV-1 infection has also been reported in some studies (3, 4), others have failed to demonstrate such activity (1). IFITM proteins are small, with an average size of 130 amino acids, and share a topology (5) defined by a conserved CD225 domain (6). This domain consists of two intramembrane (IM) regions and a conserved intracellular loop (CIL).",

In humans, IFITM1, -2, and -3 are expressed in a wide range of tissues, while IFITM5 expression is limited to osteoblasts. Mice have orthologues for IFITM1, -2, -3, and -5 and additional IFITM genes, Ifitm6 and Ifitm7 (8). Genome analysis of chickens has predicted the existence of two IFITM genes, orthologous to human IFITM10 (huIFITM10) and huIFITM5 (9). However, such in silico analysis is often confounded by inappropriate identification of pseudogenes and incorrect assignment of orthologues, due to an incomplete knowledge of IFITM gene duplication and evolutionary history of this locus during speciation. Under such circumstances, careful genome analysis of syntenic regions and functional characterization of genes are required to attempt to unambiguously define orthologous genes.",

            "text": "IFITM proteins are the only mediators of innate immunity known to inhibit viral infection by blocking cytoplasmic entry and replication of diverse enveloped viruses (10). IFITM-mediated viral restriction occurs at entry sites of susceptible viruses, in the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, where the proteins are predicted to adopt an intramembrane structure. The N and C termini of the proteins are predicted to be cytoplasmic, the two intramembrane domains are buried within the cytoplasmic facing lipid bilayer, and the CD225 domain is thought to be facing the cytoplasm (11). IFITM proteins inhibit formation of a fusion pore between the virus and endosomal membranes following acidic activation of virus envelope fusion proteins. Recently, the ability of IFITM proteins to alter cellular membrane fluidity was demonstrated, leading to the arrest of fusion pore formation at the stage of hemimembrane fusion (12). Furthermore, it was recently found that IFITM3 interacts with vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA) and prevents its association with oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) (13), which disturbs intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and thus causes inhibition of viral fusion in the late endosome, by an unknown mechanism.",

The induction of type I IFNs further promotes IFITM expression, increasing their protective effect on surrounding uninfected cells. Depletion of Ifitm3 in mouse cells results in a loss of 40% to 70% of IFN\u2032s protective effect against endosomal entering viruses (1). A similar attenuation is also observed from cells derived from IfitmDel mice, lacking Ifitm1, -2, -3, -5, and 6, suggesting IFITM3 accounts for most of the antiviral activity of this locus for the viruses investigated (14). Importantly, mice homozygous for Ifitm3 deletion suffer fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with low-pathogenicity IAV (14, 15). Direct clinical relevance of IFITM3's involvement in restricting human IAV infection has recently been shown in individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses (15), where a statistically significant number of hospitalized patients show overrepresentation of a minor C allele in IFITM3 (rs12252-C) that correlates with a decrease in the ability of IFITM3 to restrict influenza virus infection in vitro. Importantly, the significance of the association of the rs12252-C allele with severe influenza infection was recently replicated in a Chinese cohort of patients (16). Together, these data reveal that the action of IFITM3 profoundly alters the course of influenza virus infection in mammals and that allelic variation in IFITM3 alters host susceptibility to severe influenza virus infection. Although IFITMs have been well characterized in humans and mice, little compelling functional data exists for this ISG family in other species.",

            "text": "Avian IAVs represent a continuing threat to human populations both as a source for direct human infection and as a reservoir for IAV genetic variation. These reservoirs provide the conditions for the generation of reassorted IAVs with altered host ranges and pandemic potential (17). Furthermore, endemic and emerging avian viral pathogens create major challenges to the poultry industry through loss of productivity and mortality. Similarly, lyssaviruses, particularly rabies virus (RABV), pose a substantial public health threat, with half of the world's population living in areas of endemicity (18), although reports of avian lyssavirus infections are rare. The clinical presentations of an infection are identical for all lyssavirus species; however, while current vaccines and postexposure prophylaxis provide sterilizing immunity against RABV and genetically similar species, no such protection is conferred against the more genetically diverse lyssaviruses (19). Intrinsic innate immunity plays an important role in controlling the spread of numerous enveloped viruses; however, the influence of the IFITM ISGs on members of the Lyssavirus genus has not previously been evaluated. Although putative IFITM genes have been identified by database searching in many species (6, 9), no formal genome analysis or functional assessment of avian IFITM genes has been undertaken. Here we report the analysis of the IFITM locus, reaffirming the existence of chicken IFITM1 (chIFITM1) and providing the first functional characterization of chIFITM2 and chIFITM3, as well as demonstrating restriction of endosome-entering viruses by chIFITMs in vitro.",

Chicken and human IFITM gene sequences were synthesized (GeneArt; Life Technologies) as codon-optimized genes for expression in human cells, and chicken IFITMs were also synthesized for optimal expression in chicken cells. All IFITM genes were cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the lentivirus vector, pSIN-BNHA (20), and sequences confirmed by capillary sequencing (GATC Biotech). The gene cassette was cloned into pSIN-BNHA, to ensure that a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag followed the IFITM protein. Lentivirus vector stocks were made by a three-plasmid transfection of HEK293T cells, grown to confluence in a 10-cm dish. Briefly, 200 \u03bcl of Opti-MEM (Gibco) was mixed with 10 \u03bcl of Fugene-6 (Roche) before addition of 1 \u03bcg of a gag-pol-expressing vector (p8.91), 1 \u03bcg of a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-expressing vector (pMDG), and 1.5 \u03bcg of vector expressing the transgene (pSIN-BNHA) and incubated for 15 min. The medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 8 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and the DNA mixture was added dropwise to the cells. After 24 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2, the medium was removed and replaced with 8 ml DMEM plus 10% FBS and incubated for a further 24 h. Packaged lentivirus vector was harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection by collecting the supernatant and being filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm-pore filter (Millex). The lentiviruses were used to transduce human A549 lung epithelial cells and produce a mixed population from which single cell clones were derived by limiting dilution. Expression of IFITMs was detected by HA flow cytometric analysis.",

The putative IFITM5 gene is located next to an uncharacterized gene (ENSGALG00000006478), with which it shares 30% amino acid identity. Immediately adjacent to this are three sequence gaps whose estimated sizes are 1 kb, 1 kb, and 400 bp in the ENSEMBL chicken genome build. Importantly, the putative IFITM genes in chicken are flanked by the telomeric \u03b2-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 4 (B4GALNT4) gene and the centromeric acid trehalase-like 1 (ATHL1) gene. The B4GALNT4 and ATHL1 genes flank the antiviral IFITM 1, 2, -3, and -5 gene block in mammalian genomes. Sequence similarity searches of the most recent build of the chicken genome (v4.0, NCBI) using TBLASTN analysis and the putative IFITM5 amino acid sequence, revealed several transcripts with high amino acid identity to IFITM5. Additionally, BLAST hits were also identified to putative genes LOC770612 and LOC422993, within the locus flanked by B4GALNT4 and ATHL1. Between these putative genes, two BLAST hits span the exons of genes designated chicken IFITM3-like (NCBI, LOC422993; GenBank accession no. XM_420925.4) and IFITM1-like (NCBI LOC770612; GenBank accession no. XM_001233949.3). A third BLAST hit matches an uncurated gene, \u201cgene 376074,\u201d which is positioned between IFITM3-like and IFITM5. Further analysis of gene 376074 showed it shared amino acid sequence identity with both IFITM3-like and IFITM1-like genes. Sequence similarity searches of the NCBI chicken expressed sequence tag (EST) database suggests gene 376074 is expressed. All of the chIFITM paralogues, like mammalian IFITMs, are comprised of two exons, and the location of the intron-exon boundary is conserved across all of the chicken IFITM genes. Therefore, the chicken genome contains an intact IFITM locus with four putative IFITM genes flanked by the genes B4GALNT4 and ATHL1 (Fig. 1A).",

Multiple amino acid sequence alignments between the three predicted antiviral chIFITM genes and direct orthologues in primate species suggest this assignment is plausible. A number of conserved IFITM family motifs are present in some of the chicken sequences (Fig. 1B), and although the chicken sequences differ significantly from the human and chimpanzee orthologues, many amino acids in the CIL domain are conserved. Multiple sequence alignments also reveal important amino acids in the chicken IFITMs that help to categorize each sequence as either IFITM1 or IFITM2/3. Tyr20 is conserved in all primate IFITM2 or -3 sequences and is also present in chicken \u201cIFITM1-like\u201d (NCBI) but none of the other IFITM1 orthologues. This, as well as the longer N terminus, further supports our assessment of this gene as an IFITM2 or -3 gene, and by synteny, the gene is IFITM3. The alignment also reveals that other functionally significant amino acids are conserved in some of the chicken IFITM sequences, including the two cysteines (Cys75 and -76) in IM1 that are palmitoylation sites in other species (11) and are important for membrane positioning. Phe79, also in IM1, is conserved in chicken \u201cIFITM1-like\u201d (chIFITM3), which is believed to be important for mediation of a physical association between IFITM proteins (22). In light of syntenic analysis (and functional support shown later), we suggest the following revisions of the NCBI nomenclature: LOC770612 as chIFITM3 (previously \u201cIFITM1-like\u201d), LOC422993 as chIFITM1 (previously chicken \u201cIFITM3-like\u201d), and gene 376074 as chIFITM2 (Fig. 1).",

We therefore synthesized codon-optimized, C-terminal HA-tagged chIFITM1, -2, and -3 and transiently transfected chicken DF-1 fibroblasts, comparing their cellular localization to the orthologous human IFITM (huIFITM) proteins expressed in human A549 cells. Confocal microscopy using an anti-HA antibody and an anti-LAMP1 antibody showed chIFITM1 was diffusely expressed throughout the cytoplasm, and chIFITM2 was present in the cytoplasm and the cell membrane, whereas chIFITM3 localized perinuclearly (Fig. 2A to C), consistent with huIFITM3. chIFITM3 therefore shares synteny, amino acid similarity, and subcellular localization with huIFITM3. In the case of the other two chIFITMs, their localization is a less clearly paired with the human IFITMs; thus, our nomenclature is founded on the gene order.",

By expressing chIFITM3 at different levels in the cell, we show that there is a strong expression-level-dependent correlation between the level of chIFITM3 expression and the percentage of cells infected by a lentivirus vector pseudotyped with the lyssavirus envelope of LBV (Fig. 3). We then compared the level of antiviral restriction of chicken IFITM2 and -3 to that of their orthologous human proteins in A549 cells. Overexpression of chIFITM3 resulted in 79.4% and 85% reductions in infection of A549s to lentivirus vectors pseudotyped with the lyssaviruses envelopes RABV and LBV, similar to the level of restriction by huIFITM3 to the same viruses (Fig. 4A), even though chickens are rarely infected by lyssaviruses (23). chIFITM2 also restricts lyssavirus LBV and RABV infection to a similar level as chIFITM3. A similar pattern of restriction is seen for lentiviruses pseudotyped with IAV H1, H5, H7, and H10 (Fig. 4B). huIFITM3 restricts viral infection of all influenza virus hemagglutinins, reducing infection by greater than 90%, and chIFITM3 restricts H1 and H10 pseudotypes as effectively, but restricts H5 and H7 less well. chIFITM2 and huIFITM2 restrict more moderately, as shown by others. Consistent with previous studies on huIFITM3 protein (1, 2), chIFITM3 failed to restrict MLV-A (Fig. 4D). Overall, although chIFITM3 and huIFITM3 only share 42% amino acid identity, the level of viral restriction of chIFITM3 is similar to that in huIFITM3. Data are not shown for chIFITM1, as a stably expressing cell line could not be made; this lack of stability at high expression levels is supported by Hach et al. (24), who show that overexpression of unpalmitoylated murine IFITM1 is difficult to achieve.",

Treatment with this siRNA on unstimulated DF-1 cells resulted in a 1.23-log2 (2.4-fold) reduction in the transcript level, with no change in chIFITM3 transcript abundance with a nonspecific siRNA. Knockdown of endogenous chIFITM3 resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in infection of DF-1 cells by replication-competent influenza A virus (A/WSN/1933) (Fig. 5B), assayed by flow cytometric analysis of NP expression. Furthermore, overexpression of chIFITM3 in DF-1 cells reduced viral replication by an average of 55% (Fig. 5D), and plaque assays show that the viral load was reduced from 1.3 \u00d7 106 PFU ml\u22121 to 3.1 \u00d7 105 PFU ml\u22121 after chIFITM3 overexpression (Fig. 5E). Together, these results show chIFITM3 is able to restrict IAV entry into DF-1 cells.",

Computational analysis of vertebrate genomes suggests the IFITM gene family is present throughout vertebrates. However, this analysis and any phylogenetic reconstruction of gene history are complicated by the paralogous nature of the IFITM gene family, the presence of copy number variations, and the presence of numerous processed pseudogenes (6). Indeed, the identification of avian IFITMs as part of the dispanin protein family failed to identify chicken IFITMs in the antiviral IFITM1- to -3 subfamily defined as DSP2a to -c (25). Similarly, a more thorough analysis of vertebrate IFITMs, while identifying distantly related IFITMs in reptiles and birds, focused on eutherian clade 1 sequences for a detailed phylogenetic analysis (9). Hickford et al. (26) have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of IFITM genes across a broad range of chordates. The authors have shown that all of the species analyzed, including \u201clower\u201d vertebrates, such as lampreys, possess at least one IFITM-like gene. Phylogenetic analysis of all of the IFITM paralogues they identified revealed that IFITM5 emerged in bony fish, while IFITM10 appears restricted to tetrapods. Here we have resolved the entire antiviral IFITM locus on chromosome 5 of the chicken genome, expanding the number of IFITM genes to 4 in this locus, and confirmed that the locus is flanked by the genes ATHL1 and B4GALNT4 (9). Crucially, we have shown that antiviral activity is conserved in chicken IFITMs. The low-level sequence identity and orientation change of chIFITM2 and chIFITM1 make the phylogenetic assignment of orthology problematic. Our revised nomenclature of the chicken IFITM locus is based on the syntenic gene order, as previously discussed, and functional data where possible. However, given chIFITM2 is localized to the plasma membrane, and the lack of an N-terminal extension (characteristic of huIFITM2/3), it is possible that it is analogous to huIFITM1. It is likely that similar extensive genetic and functional analyses will be essential to characterize the IFITM loci in other vertebrate species and define unambiguously IFITM1, -2, and -3 orthologues.",

Sequence identity and conserved synteny with the chIFITM locus indicate they are IFITM5 and IFITM1. The two IFITM flanking genes, B4GALNT4 and ATHL1, are also located on the scaffold in conserved positions. Although annotated gene structures are absent in the browser, IFITM cDNAs in other avian species align with the regions adjacent to both ends of the IFITM1 structure. This suggests the duck retains four IFITM genes at a conserved locus. We would expect the positions of duIFITM2 and duIFITM3 to be conserved with their orthologues in the chicken and other species. Following infection with two H5N1 strains of avian influenza virus (A/duck/Hubei/49/05 and A/goose/Hubei/65/05), levels of expression of duck IFITM3, -5, and -10 (measured by RNAseq) were increased to various degrees, reflecting a response befitting their expected function (27).",

RABV is responsible for approximately 70,000 human deaths each year (28), while other lyssaviruses have only been conclusively shown to cause a handful of fatalities (29), although this could be due to poor surveillance. Our results are the first to show diverse members of this genus of virus are sensitive to the inhibitory action of human IFITM proteins. Furthermore, although most warm-blooded animals are susceptible to RABV, domestic birds are rarely infected by lyssaviruses (23). Despite this, chIFITM2 and -3 were able to significantly reduce cell lyssavirus infection. Avian IAV infections, however, pose significant threats to human health, to the international poultry industry, and to small-scale poultry farmers (30). Our identification and functional characterization of the avian IFITM locus, together with knowledge that this gene family exists with copy number and allelic variants in other species (9, 15, 16), should provide a focus for identifying IFITM variants with enhanced antiviral activity for use in farm animal breeding strategies to improve animal infectious disease resistance. Specifically, we hypothesize that certain wild or outbred chicken IFITM allelic variants will confer enhanced levels of protection to pathogenic avian viruses that enter through acidic endosomes and that breeding for enhanced activity in IFITM variants will improve disease resistance in chickens. Similarly, should chicken IFITM proteins restrict IAV infection in chick embryos, the ablation of IFITM protein expression could improve vaccine production and boost yield.",
