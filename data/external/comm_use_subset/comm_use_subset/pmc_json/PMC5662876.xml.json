The purpose of this work is to identify whether the intracellular pathogen sensor DHX36 is involved in PRRSV-induced inflammatory response. In this study, we found that the expression levels of DHX36 in cytoplasm increase after PRRSV infection. Knockdown and overexpression analyzes showed that DHX36 is involved in both PRRSV and N protein-induced NF-\u03baB signal activation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that N protein binds to DHX36, both in transfected HEK293T cells and in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. Thus, our studies have illuminated a cellular mechanism responsible for PRRSV-associated inflammatory responses that may contribute to a deeper understanding of the infection and pathogenesis of PRRSV.",

First, we utilized DHX36-specific siRNA to silence DHX36. The knockdown efficiency of the synthesized siRNA-targeting DHX36 (si-DHX36) was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses. Compared with the cells treated with NC siRNA, cells transfected with si-DHX36 significantly decreased DHX36 expression at protein and mRNA levels (Figure 3A). Next, we assessed the impact of DHX36 silencing in response to PRRSV stimulation. Poly I:C was used as a positive control. As expected, when DHX36 was knocked down in MARC-145 cells, the poly I:C-induced activation of NF-\u03baB-promoter-dependent luciferase activity was less pronounced (Figure 3B). Similarly, compared to DHX36-knockdown MARC-145 cells, cells transfected with NC siRNA induced high levels of NF-\u03baB activation following stimulation with PRRSV, highlighting the importance of DHX36 for NF-\u03baB signal activation in response to PRRSV infection (Figure 3B).",

As shown in Figure 4C, compared with NC siRNA, knockdown of MyD88 significantly reduced PRRSV-induced NF-\u03baB activation, but no appreciable change was detected after knockdown of TRIF. We further validated this observation by Western blotting analysis of I\u03baB\u03b1 expression level and P65 phosphorylation. To this end, MARC-145 cells were transfected with DHX36-, MyD88-, and TRIF-specific siRNA or control scrambled siRNA, after which the cells were infected with PRRSV, and cell extracts were prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Consistent with the results of the dual-luciferase assay, Western blotting showed that I\u03baB\u03b1 protein degradation and P65 phosphorylation were strongly impaired in both DHX36- and MyD88-knockdown cells, whereas these parameters barely changed in TRIF-knockdown cells (Figure 4D).

In fact, host cells possess a number of PRRs to detect invading virus (28). Viral proteins in some cases can serve as PAMPs to be recognized by certain PRRs such as TLR2 and TLR4, to trigger the innate immune response (32, 33). In this study, we demonstrate that the N protein of PRRSV binds to DHX36 in both transfected HEK293T cells and PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells. The interactome map of the PRRSV N protein has been examined using a proteomics approach, and several DExD/H-box helicase superfamily proteins, including DDX3X, DDX5, DDX17, DHX9, DHX30, and DHX36, were identified (34, 35). Consistent with this observation, our work not only validated the interaction between N protein and DHX36 but further showed that the N-terminal domain of DHX36 was responsible for mediating binding of PRRSV N protein. In addition, inhibition of DHX36 expression by specific siRNA impaired N protein-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. Our study therefore provides evidence that a virus-derived protein can bind to the cytoplasmic PRR DHX36 and can subsequently stimulate NF-\u03baB activation.",

For example, overexpression of DDX3X was found to significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells (36). In addition, it has been shown that DDX5 plays a positive role in the replication of PRRSV via its interaction with viral nsp9 in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 and PAM cells (37). More recently, DHX9 was reported to be recruited by the N protein during PRRSV infection to aid the synthesis of viral genomic RNA (38). Although the roles of DExD/H-box family proteins in viral replication are well documented, their importance in detecting invading virus is just becoming evident. In this regard, DDX19a was discovered to be an RNA sensor that triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 production by detecting PRRSV genomic RNA (4). Thus, both DDX19a-NLRP3-related viral RNA sensing and DHX36-mediated viral N protein recognition might contribute collaboratively to uncontrolled progression of virus-induced inflammation, which culminates in exacerbated pathogenesis and development of pneumonia.",

As an evolutionarily conserved DEAH-box ATP-dependent helicase, DHX36 is highly specific for DNA and RNA G4s with N-terminal extension motifs required for quadruplex recognition (5). This N-terminal domain was also found to be both essential and sufficient for its localization in stress granules, the membraneless RNA- and RNA-binding protein-containing complexes that are transiently assembled in stressful conditions to promote cell survival (41). Recently, biochemical data have shown that DHX36 and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) form a complex in a dsRNA-dependent manner and facilitate dsRNA binding, phosphorylation, and activation of PKR, processes which are essential for the formation of stress granules (25). It is noteworthy that stress granule formation is also triggered by PRRSV infection, which in turn facilitates pro-inflammatory cytokine production (unpublished data). These observations imply that there is some unidentified relationship between PRRSV-triggered stress granule formation and the activation of DHX36 signaling. In addition, Western blots were performed to detect the expression of P65 and p-P65 by co-expression of N protein and the wild-type DHX36 or individual DHX36 mutant. We found that, except the wild-type DHX36, all DHX36 mutants (mutants a, b, c, d, and e) cannot up-regulate the phosphorylation level of P65 when co-expressed with N protein (data not shown). This is possibly because DHX36 mutants a, b, and c lack the C-terminal MyD88-binding domain responsible for downstream signaling activation, while mutants d and e lose the N-terminal domain responsible for binding with PRRSV N protein.",

Among the viral-derived proteins that are involved in PRRSV-induced pathogenesis, identification of the major contributor to severely impaired IFN responses and the massive inflammation in the respiratory tract associated with PRRSV infection, along with dissection of the underlying molecular mechanism, is of critical importance. Although recent studies have revealed that several proteins encoded by the PRRSV genome independently antagonize IFN signaling, only N protein has been widely accepted to possess the ability of activating NF-\u03baB signaling (23). Thus, the current study sought to identify the mechanisms by which PRRSV N protein activates NF-\u03baB-driven inflammatory responses and identified that DHX36 is involved in N protein-mediated NF-\u03baB activation. In fact, the N protein of PRRSV is a multifunctional protein in addition to its role in packaging viral genomic RNA (9, 50). Several amino acid motifs on the N protein have been identified not only to be involved in virus replication but are also associated with cellular proteins and signaling pathways (51, 52), such as translation initiation and RNA post-transcriptional modification (53\u201355). These studies, together with our work, demonstrate the importance of the N protein in the life cycle of Arteriviruses.",

Knockdown of DHX36 significantly suppresses the NF-\u03baB-driven pro-inflammatory cytokine production by PRRSV infection. Moreover, DHX36 interacts with the N protein of PRRSV and is involved in N protein-induced activation of NF-\u03baB signaling. This work provides a new understanding of the ability of type 2 PRRSV to induce NF-\u03baB activation, but whether DHX36 is also associated with the pathogenesis of PRRSV EU strain (type 1) deserves further investigation.",
