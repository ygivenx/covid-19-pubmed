            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens first described in the USA in the 1930\u2019s [1\u20133]. Clinical signs include: coughing, sneezing, rales and nasal discharge. The disease can also affect the reproductive organs, which leads to a decrease in egg quality and production, thus making it a major cause of economic losses within the poultry industry [4]. The causative virus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is a coronavirus, which is an enveloped virus with a single positive-stranded RNA genome, which replicates in the host cell cytoplasm [5]. Proteins encoded by IBV include the viral RNA polymerase, structural spike proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid and various other regulatory proteins. The spike glycoprotein mediates cell attachment and plays a significant role in host cell specificity [6].",

Mortality is usually fairly low (~5 %), however some strains of the virus can also cause nephritis meaning that, depending on strain, mortality can be greater than 50 % [7, 8] or even up to 80 % with some Australian isolates [9]. IBV infection leaves birds more susceptible to colibacillosis [10] and subsequent bacterial infections can also lead to a high level of mortality [11]. Currently, attenuated live vaccines are used in broilers and pullets, and killed vaccines are used in layers and breeders [12]. However, virus control is very difficult, as there are only a few vaccine types and many different strains of IBV. The virus also continues to mutate rapidly, generating more virulent strains of the disease [13\u201315]. Coronaviruses have now also been detected in other avian species such as turkey, duck, goose, pheasant, guinea fowl, teal, pigeon, peafowl and partridge [4].",

In this study we attempt to identify non-MHC genes, which may be involved in resistance to IBV. No genetic analyses have thus far been undertaken in order to try and do this and no quantitative trait loci or genes associated with resistance have been determined, so far. Based on differential gene expression in susceptible and resistant lines of chickens, we identify potential candidate genes for disease resistance towards IBV (virulent M41 strain). Building on the previous work by Dar et al. [17] and Wang et al. [18] we used Affymetrix whole-genome chicken microarrays to examine the tracheal gene expression profiles of a line of birds known to be susceptible to IBV infection (line 15I) and a line known to show resistance (line N). We determined the early host response to infection and propose possible candidate genes for involvement in disease resistance towards IBV. Understanding how coronaviruses infect the host and identifying genes involved in resistance is important not only for the poultry industry but also has important implications for human health, as diseases such as SARS are also caused by coronaviruses [19, 20].",

The lines have since been maintained at the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, UK. Two-week-old chicks from each line (15I and N) were separated into two experimental rooms, with ad libitum access to food and water. In one room, 54 birds (27 from each line) were infected with 4 log10 CID50 (104 CID50) of virulent IBV-M41 strain in a total of 100 \u03bcl of 0.2 % BSA in PBS equally by intra nasal and ocular routes. In the other room, 54 control birds (27 from each line) received 100ul PBS via the same route. Trachea samples (upper half) were collected at 2, 3 and 4 days post-infection (9 individual birds from each line at each time point).

Anything with a p-value <0.25 is deemed significant when using this software. Use of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program [30] revealed which canonical pathways are being switched on by IBV infection in the host (with Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction) and allowed us to analyze the gene interaction networks involved in the host response. Genes were clustered by similar expression pattern and analysed for enriched GO-terms and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) using Expander (v5.2) [31]. Normalised expression data from control samples were compared with infected samples to examine the host response to IBV infection. Enrichment analysis of particular GO terms or TFBS within clusters was done using the TANGO and PRIMA functions, respectively, within the Expander package.",

Viral RNA was detected in infected birds, but no significant difference in viral load was detected between lines at any of the days 2, 3 or 4 post infection (Fig. 1). This would indicate that the resistance to the virus seen in Line N is due to how the birds respond to the virus once it has entered the body and is not a measure of how the birds can prevent initial infection by the virus itself. When resistance to IBV infection was originally determined in these lines, it was noted that they were equally susceptible to infection, but a variation in outcome was seen. In line N, 33 % of birds showed air sac lesions whereas 73 % of 15I birds presented lesions. Mortality was 0 in line N, but 47 % within line 15I birds. It was hypothesized that the different lines were producing different immunological responses upon infection [21].",

The resulting pathway diagrams are extremely useful in establishing which gene networks are involved in a particular experimental response. As seen in Fig. 2, genes involved in antigen presentation and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway are up-regulated. TLRs identify pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and are crucial to the innate immune system. In this study TLR3 is shown to be induced at 3 dpi. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA intermediates produced during viral replication and has previously been shown to be induced in the trachea at this time after IBV infection [37]. Another pathway involved is the phosphatidylinositol signalling pathway (Table 2). Phosphatidylinositol kinases are known to play an important role in the viral life cycle after infection of the host and PI4KB is known to be exploited by coronaviruses for viral entry. The product of PI4KB catalysis is phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and coronavirus entry into the host is mediated by the PI4P lipid microenvironment [38]. Genes involved in the complement system are also highlighted as being up-regulated in response to IBV infection. Complement-mediated lysis of viruses is an important facet of the host innate immune system and its role in defence against viral infection [39] \u2013 as reflected in the induction of these genes in this study.",

A very early induction of IFN-\u03b3 has been reported in splenocytes [40], and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lung leukocytes [41]. IFNB expression has also been reported in trachea between 1 and 2 dpi [42]. We do not see this increase in expression of interferon genes (due to the absence of data earlier than 2 dpi), but we do see the downstream effects, with increased expression of many interferon-induced genes. Specific physiological processes activated upon IBV infection can also be seen in Fig. 3b.

Examination of the gene expression profiles in the control birds of the two different lines also allowed us to identify genes, which are inherently different between the susceptible and resistant birds. It can be seen that there are numerous genes, which show large expression differences between the two lines, even before infection. Dramatic differences in gene expression of certain genes, including DDT, SRI, BLB1, HSCB, BF1, BF2, SUCLG2, MX1 and SRI, which are more highly expressed in the resistant N line compared to the susceptible 15I line are noted (Additional file 2: Table S2 shows all 1930 DE probes) So, it can be seen that these are genes which have inherently different expression levels between susceptible and resistant birds, even before infection occurs. We therefore postulate that some of these genes may play an important role in disease resistance. The potential interactome of IBV has recently been investigated by stable isotope labelling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled to a green fluorescent protein-nanotrap pull-down methodology [44]. Host proteins, which bind to the IBV N protein were identified, some of the genes for which, we see as being inherently expressed at higher levels in susceptible birds in this study. These genes include MYH9, CAPRIN1, DHX57, HNRNPH3, RPL27A, FMR1, C22orf28, HNRPDL, SFRS3, RPL31, NPM1 and RPSA.

CD38 is a glycoprotein found on the surface of many immune cells including CD4+, CD8+, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells and is a marker of cell activation. It functions in cell adhesion, signal transduction and calcium signalling. CD4 is found on the surface of immune cells such as T helper cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. It is a membrane glycoprotein which interacts with MHCII antigens. The protein functions to initiate or augment the early phase of T-cell activation. The protein encoded by FKBP5 is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immuno-regulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. Early defence by the host is a key mechanism for combatting viral infection, and induction of IFNB and other innate genes in response to IBV infection has been shown to peak around 18\u201336 hr post infection [42].",

When the differential host responses to infection are examined, it is seen that genes involved in proliferation of T-lymphocytes and genes concerned with cell attachment and cytoplasmic organization are more highly expressed in the resistant line N. Other processes significantly involved are apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 6a), which have been previously documented in IBV-infected Vero cells by Liu et al. [48]. One of the most perturbed biological networks noted in this analysis is that involving genes related to connective tissue disorders and involve many collagen genes. These genes are more highly expressed in susceptible line 15I birds compared to resistant line N birds (Fig. 6b) suggesting that IBV infection might cause more disorder of eggshell formation in this line [49]. The production of poor quality eggs by IBV infected birds may, in part be a reflection of the expression of these kinds of gene networks compared to that seen in resistant birds.",

CD38, CD4, FKBP5 and STAT3 all show a higher level of expression during the host response in the resistant birds compared to that of the susceptible birds, indicating their involvement in the host defence mechanism. CD38 and CD4, with their role as receptors on immune cells, as described above, are obvious candidates, along with FKBP5 as an immune-regulator.

We have also shown it to be highly differentially expressed in other chicken lines, which are susceptible or resistant to Marek\u2019s Disease virus [53]. IFNAR2 is an obvious candidate prediction, as the interferon response is central to the host\u2019s defence against IBV infection. TPD52L1, BCL2L1, FAIM2 and CIAPIN1 are all known to be involved in regulation of apoptosis, a process seen to be important during IBV infection.
