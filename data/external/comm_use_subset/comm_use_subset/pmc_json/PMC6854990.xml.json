            "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by bradykinesia, resting tremor, postural instability, and rigidity [1]. The disease affects 1\u20132% of the global population over the age of 65. In the brain of patients with PD, loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) and the striatum (ST) may occur even prior to the onset of the symptoms of neurodegeneration [1, 2]. Available treatments work by relieving the symptoms of PD by increasing dopaminergic signaling through one of the three mechanisms: (1) increasing the dopamine levels by increasing the levels of its biosynthetic precursor (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)), (2) blocking the breakdown of dopamine by inhibiting its metabolic enzymes (monoamine oxidase, catechol-O-methyltransferase), and (3) mimicking the activity of dopamine by directly agonizing dopamine receptors [1, 3]. However, there is still an unmet clinical need to develop mechanism-based and/or disease-modifying medications to treat both the symptoms and progression of PD.",

            "text": "Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes that are critical for the development, maintenance, and survival of dopaminergic neurons [4, 5]. In particular, Nurr1 plays a fundamental role in maintaining dopamine homeostasis by regulating the transcription of genes governing dopamine synthesis, packaging, and reuptake [4]. Nurr1 also regulates the survival of dopaminergic neurons by stimulating the transcription of genes coding for neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction management, as well as repressing the transcription and expression of proinflammatory genes [4, 6, 7]. A lack of Nurr1 in embryonic ventral midbrain cells hinders their migration into striatal areas [8]. In microglia and astrocytes, Nurr1 represses proinflammatory responses and protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammation-induced neuronal toxicity or death in the midbrain [5, 9]. In patients with PD, the expression of Nurr1 is reduced compared to age-matched controls, and a few, yet rare, Nurr1 polymorphisms appear to be associated with the disease [10, 11]. Stimulation of Nurr1 activity may combat both the reduced dopamine levels and the increased oxidative stress and inflammation associated with PD [12\u201314]. Together, these findings strongly suggest that disrupted function/expression of Nurr1 is related to neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons and alleviates inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions; thereby, it may improve the pathogenesis of PD.",

            "text": "Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius (also known as cicada or Sun-Tae), was originally described in the Chung-bu category of Dongui Bogam, an ancient Korean medical book [15, 16]. In Korean traditional medicine, CP has been used to treat epilepsy, shock, smallpox, sedation, edema, and night terror symptoms. In traditional Chinese medicine, CP is known as chantui and has long been used to treat soreness of the throat, hoarseness, itching, spasms, and other symptoms [17]. Since then, it has been used in traditional medicine for its many pharmacological effects. In 2003, a World Health Organization (WHO) international expert meeting to review and analyze the clinical reports on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) treatment noted that the Chinese were using a combination of cicada and silkworm droppings to treat SARS-associated fever [18, 19]. Recently, several studies have confirmed the pharmacological effects of CP, including its anti-skin aging, anti-kidney injury, anticonvulsive, sedative, antiallergy, and antianaphylactic shock actions [20\u201323]. However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced neurotoxicity in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1.",

After two successive days of twice-daily training (4 rpm rotation speed on the first day and 20 rpm on the second day), the test rotation speed was increased to 25 rpm on the third day in a test session. The time each mouse remained on the rotating bar was recorded over three trials per mouse, at 5 min intervals and a maximum trial length of 300 s per trial.

The resulting RNA pellet was then dried, and the purified RNA was dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate- (DEPC-) distilled water. Equal amounts of RNA (200 ng) were reverse transcribed (RT) into cDNA using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time RT polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed for selected genes using the CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) and the SYBR green fluorescence quantification system (Bio-Rad) to quantify the amplicons. The PCR conditions were 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C (30 s) and 58\u00b0C (30 s) and a standard denaturation curve. The primer sequences are listed in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 orientation in Supplementary . The PCR conditions for each target were optimized according to the primer concentration, the absence of primer dimer formation, and the efficiency of amplification of both the target genes and the housekeeping control gene. PCR reaction mixture comprised 1 \u03bcL of cDNA and 9.5 \u03bcL of PCR master mix, which contained 2\u00d7 SYBR Green, 10 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers, and 4.5 \u03bcL of DEPC-distilled water in a final volume of 15 \u03bcL. To normalize the cDNA content of the samples, we used the comparative threshold (CT) cycle method, which includes normalization of the number of target gene copies vs. the endogenous reference gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The CT is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence generated by cleavage of the probe passes a fixed threshold baseline when amplification of the PCR products is first detected.",

In MPTP-treated mice, the number of TH-positive cells in the SNPC and the optical intensity in the ST were decreased by 48.51 \u00b1 3.85% and 38.20 \u00b1 3.37%, respectively, compared with the control group. However, these values were significantly increased by 1\u201325 mg/kg CP or ropinirole treatment (82.64 \u00b1 1.31% to 91.50 \u00b1 1.31% and 91.61 \u00b1 7.30% and 88.88 \u00b1 4.75% to 79.01 \u00b1 18.21% and 91.64 \u00b1 6.30%, respectively, compared with the control group) (Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(e)). Moreover, to measure the effects of CP on dopamine levels, we determined striatal dopamine levels in the ST of mouse brains (Figure 3(c)). Treatment with MPTP significantly decreased striatal dopamine (by 8.47 \u00b1 0.25 nmol/mL) compared with the control group, while treatment with 1\u201325 mg/kg CP or ropinirole reduced MPTP-induced striatal dopamine (by 12.84 \u00b1 1.36 to 15.20 \u00b1 1.18 nmol/mL and 16.94 \u00b1 0.93 nmol/mL). Moreover, only the treatment with 5\u201325 mg/kg CP increased striatal dopamine (by 16.86 \u00b1 0.21 to 17.65 \u00b1 0.29 nmol/mL) compared with the control group (Figure 3(c)). We also investigated the effect of CP on MAO-B activity. Selegiline (positive control, 0\u20131 \u03bcM) inhibited MAO-B activity in a dose-dependent manner; in contrast, CP had no effect on MAO-B activity (Figure 3(d)).",

MPTP caused a significant decrease in Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax, Cyt-c, PARP, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3, while 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg CP increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax, Cyt-c, PARP, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 7(a)). Green fluorescence (monomeric form, low \u0394\u03c8m) and red fluorescence (aggregate form, high \u0394\u03c8m) indicate \u0394\u03c8m depolarization.

We measured the expression levels of GFAP, Iba-1, iNOS, and Cox-2, which are released following inflammatory stimuli, by western blotting. Western blotting analysis revealed that the levels of GFAP, Iba-1, iNOS, and Cox-2 were significantly increased (by 482.97 \u00b1 28.90%, 384.06 \u00b1 65.22%, 264.07 \u00b1 77.82%, and 179.78 \u00b1 11.50%, respectively) in the SNPC of the MPTP-treated group.

Representative photomicrographs were taken of immunofluorescence staining with anti-Cox-2, GFAP, and Iba-1 antibodies in the SNPC (Figures 8(b) and 8(g)). Microglial BV2 cell cytotoxicity was not affected by 1\u201362.5 \u03bcg/mL CP, as assessed by the MTT assay at 24 h after treatment. However, 125\u20131000 \u03bcg/mL CP increased cytotoxicity (data not shown). Thus, all further experiments were performed with CP at 1\u201362.5 \u03bcg/mL. Cytokine array kits revealed that the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), KC, MCP-5, and RANTES were significantly increased (by 205.03 \u00b1 4.24%, 3468.59 \u00b1 51.63%, 687.96 \u00b1 6.04%, 336.64 \u00b1 0.07%, and 192.58 \u00b1 1.65%, respectively) in LPS-treated microglial BV2 cells.

This process depends on two major signaling pathways: (i) Sonic hedgehog/FoxA2 and (ii) wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 1/Lmx1a, and their downstream signaling molecules [37, 38]. These two signaling pathways merge to control the expression levels of Nurr1, suggesting Nurr1 as a key regulator of dopaminergic neurons [39, 40]. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons fail to develop in mice lacking the Nurr1 receptor [12]. We used the VOSviewer software to visualize network similarities [41, 42]. We found a cluster of keywords across publications related to Nurr1, Alzheimer's disease pathology, PD, dopaminergic neurons, GDNF, alpha-synuclein, canonical ligand-binding pocket, and cilostazol (Supplementary Fig. ). These results led us to think that Nurr1 may be a promising target in the treatment of PD.",

            "text": "According to the WHO, as much as 80% of the world's population relies primarily on animal- and plant-based medicines [43\u201345]. Animal-assisted therapy is known as zootherapy (ZT) [45]. The phenomenon of ZT is marked both by a broad geographical distribution and very deep historical origins [45]. Despite its importance, studies on ZT have been neglected, when compared to those on plant-based therapies. However, in modern societies, ZT constitutes an important alternative to other therapies practiced worldwide [45]. Wild and domestic animals and their by-products (e.g., hooves, skins, bones, feathers, and tusks) provide important ingredients to curative, protective, and preventive medicine [46\u201348]. Recently, there has been increased interest in animal-based medicines, and several animals have been tested by pharmaceutical companies as potential sources of modern drugs [49]. Based on the previous study on Nurr1, we screened a Korean traditional medicine library composed of clinically used drugs (Chung-bu category in Dongui Bogam) and identified one hit drug. A previous report showed that Nurr1 promotes dopaminergic neuronal development by inducing the expression of neurotrophic factors, such as TH, DDC, DAT, and VMAT2 [4, 27]. Dopamine is transported into synaptic vesicles by VMAT2, a major factor in maintaining dopamine homeostasis in dopaminergic presynaptic terminals [50, 51]. It has also been demonstrated that Nurr1 gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with PD is decreased compared to that of healthy people [10]. In the present study, CP increased the levels of Nurr1 and its regulating proteins, TH, DDC, DAT, and VMAT2, in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC. Moreover, Nurr1 knockdown using siRNA blocked a CP-mediated increase in TH, DAT, and VMAT2 protein expression, suggesting that Nurr1 activation is crucial for CP-induced TH, DAT, and VMAT2 upregulation. Recently, studies have shown that two regions in Nurr1, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, are important for its transcriptional activation [52]. The Nurr1 N-terminus is important for regulating transcription in a mitogen-activated protein kinase- (MAPK-) dependent manner [52]. It has been reported that Nurr1 can be phosphorylated by ERK1/2 and translocate to the nucleus, where it upregulates TH expression [52\u201354]. In the present study, an ERK inhibitor inhibited a CP-induced increase in Nurr1, TH, DDC, DAT, and VMAT2 in differentiated PC12 cells. We also found that CP can regulate striatal dopamine levels in the mouse ST. MAO-B is mainly involved in dopamine metabolism [55]. To confirm that the disease-modifying actions of CP could not be ascribed to the prevention of conversion of MPTP to MPP+, we also measured the activity of MAO-B [25, 55]. However, CP had no effect on MAO-B activity. These results suggest that CP increases neurotrophic factors by upregulating Nurr1 expression via ERK phosphorylation. It has been recently suggested that Nurr1 inducers exert neuroprotective effects in experimental models of PD; thus, possible future therapeutic strategies for PD may include inducing Nurr1 signaling by CP.",

            "text": "The above-described findings prompted us to test whether CP can ameliorate motor behavior deficits in a mouse model of MPTP-induced PD. This animal model is used widely because dopaminergic neuronal loss in the SNPC and ST is associated with the onset of motor symptoms, and there is a direct relationship between the extent of dopamine loss and motor dysfunction [28, 56]. The pole test assesses animal agility and includes measures of muscle rigidity and bradykinesia [57]. The rotarod test can be used to assess motor coordination and postural balance [57]. In the pole test, CP-treated mice showed a significant improvement in T-turn and T-LA, with measurements similar to those in the control group. In addition, in the rotarod test, CP prolonged the duration spent by the mice on the rotarod. Similar to our study, Hsieh et al. reported that CP increases hypomotility induced by a TH inhibitor or 5-hydroxytryptophan (a precursor of serotonin) [21]. Moreover, our results showed that CP significantly increased MPTP-induced dopamine levels. CP can stabilize central catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity and is expected to be effective in various disorders, such as convulsion and insomnia [21]. Therefore, we think there is a need to focus on further studies on catecholamine and behavioral changes. Furthermore, we confirmed these effects by TH-specific IHC, which demonstrated that CP protected both dopaminergic neurons in the SNPC and their fibers in the ST, compared with mice treated with MPTP only. In the present study, the number of TH/Nurr1 double-positive neurons and Nurr1 and its regulating proteins in the SNPC declined in the MPTP group compared with the control group, while colocalization and expression levels were increased in the CP-treated groups. GDNF and its canonical receptor Ret can signal together or independently to fulfill many important functions in the midbrain's dopaminergic system [58, 59]. Nurr1 and Ret, its downstream target, were found to be transcriptionally downregulated by \u03b1-synuclein accumulation [60]. Reduced Ret protein levels might prevent GDNF-induced survival response in midbrain dopaminergic neurons [61]. Thus, this rationale linked GDNF/Ret signaling to Nurr1, another protein found to be mutated in a rare familial form of PD (autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutation). In this study, CP significantly protected MPTP-induced GDNF/Ret signaling in mice. Taken together, the present study showed that CP significantly improved MPTP-induced PD-like movement problems and protected against dopaminergic neuronal damage and neurotrophic response activity in mouse dopaminergic neurons.",

            "text": "Finally, because Nurr1 has proapoptotic as well as antiapoptotic effects, we also analyzed the effects of CP on mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. The Bcl-2 protein family contains key apoptosis-regulating proteins that can promote cell survival or induce cell death [62]. Bcl-2 appears to directly or indirectly preserve the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane, thus preventing Cyt-c release and mitochondria-mediated cell death initiation [62, 63]. On the other hand, the proapoptotic protein Bax promotes Cyt-c release from the mitochondria, with subsequent cleaved caspase-9/caspase-3 and PARP [63]. Recently, Nurr1 has been shown to downregulate the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, which is directly transactivated by the tumor suppressor p53 [64]. Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of Nurr1 downregulates cleaved caspase-3 and other apoptotic factors in neural stem cells [65]. In this study, MPTP induced a slight decrease in Bcl-2 expression and an increase in Bax expression; CP protected against these changes. Moreover, MPTP-induced toxicity increased Cyt-c, whereas CP inhibited Cyt-c release. The induction of Cyt-c-mediated cleaved caspase-9/caspase-3 and PARP levels by proapoptotic agents, including MPTP, appears to be essential for apoptosis, and treatment with CP prevented the MPTP-induced increase in cleaved caspase-9/caspase-3 and PARP levels. Because Nurr1-induced antiapoptotic effects are associated with pro- as well as anti-inflammatory responses, we also checked the effects of CP on proinflammatory cytokines and signaling molecules. Moreover, Xu et al. demonstrated that CP can decrease inflammatory-related proteins such as IL-6, iNOS, and Cox-2 in LPS-induced Raw 264.7 macrophage cells [20]. Moreover, according to Chang et al., CP inhibits inflammation-related proteins such as IL-6 and NF-\u03baB via modulating reactive oxygen species induced by ultraviolet B irradiation on keratinocyte HaCaT cells [23]. Therefore, it was possible to have an anti-inflammatory effect. In our study, CP repressed neuroinflammatory signaling molecules, such as iNOS and Cox-2, and glial/microglial activation in MPTP- or LPS-treated mice. Moreover, when microglial cells were treated with inflammation-inducing LPS for 24 h, the expression of proinflammatory genes (cytokine array: G-CSF, GM-CSF, sICAM-1, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12 p70, IL-16, IL-17, IL-23, IP-10, I-TAC, KC, M-CSF, MCP-5, MIP-2, RANTES, SDF-1, TARC, and TNF-\u03b1) was increased more than 2-fold. Remarkably, CP reduced the expression of ICAM-1, KC, IL-6, MCP-5, and RANTES (>30%). However, further studies using Nurr1 transgenic mice will be required to confirm our findings. Next, we analyzed protein-protein interactions using the STRING database and potential molecular mechanisms using the KEGG database (Supplementary Fig. ). We found functional relationships among the proteins primarily related to inflammatory and neuronal death mechanisms, including small-cell lung cancer, tuberculosis, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, apoptosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hepatitis B, influenza A, platinum drug resistance, pathways in cancer, colorectal cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, toxoplasmosis, TNF signaling pathway, PD, legionellosis, and p53 signaling pathway. Taken together, our data showed that CP enhanced the dual role of Nurr1: CP (i) increased the expression of Nurr1 and its regulating proteins in dopaminergic neurons and (ii) inhibited mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression.",

            "text": "This study has some limitations. First, we did not investigate the effects of CP on MPTP-induced PD in mice lacking Nurr1. Studies using Nurr1-lacking mice are being carried out; however, more research is still needed because these studies are in their screening stages. Therefore, we confirmed it using siRNA as a pilot study, and we believe that more detailed research is needed through knockout animal models. Second, doses of CP in human were 3-6 g daily [15, 16]. According to human equivalent dose calculation, for body weight of 60 kg, the corresponding human dose of the extract of CP was 121.8 mg/day. Among our unpublished studies, we evaluated the safety of the CP extract using a standard toxicological study design to assess the potential oral dose toxicity. During the study period of 2 weeks, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered once daily with doses of 50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day of the CP extract after which several study parameters of mortality, clinical signs, changes in body weight, gross findings, organ weight, histopathological examinations, and hematology were assessed. We demonstrated that the CP extract did not have any adverse effects in mice up to a dose of 450 mg/kg/day for a 2-week administration period (data not shown). The human equivalent dose calculated as 121.8 mg/day is 18-fold lower than the 450 mg/kg/day (2189.1 mg/day in human) of the CP extract used in our unpublished study. Therefore, this study provides an important reference for the safety of the CP extract for humans. However, more detailed research on clinicians will not be available until further studies are conducted. Lastly, we did not identify the active compounds of CP that are responsible for its anti-PD effects. In this study, we mainly analyzed and separate catecholamine compounds, focusing on the various neurohormonal changes in insect metamorphosis (Supplementary Fig. ) [66\u201368]. This is because we expected a large amount of neurohormones to be released and left in the skin when the insect was exterminated. However, since this study was only a pilot, screening study, we think that more research is needed to reveal more accurate mechanisms. Future studies are needed to analyze the specific contribution of the various active compounds of CP.",
