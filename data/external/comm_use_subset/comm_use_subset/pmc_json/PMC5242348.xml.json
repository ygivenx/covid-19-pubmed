They all contain latex and have unique flower structures. About 70 species have been reported in Iran that 17 of them are endemic (1). E. erythradenia Bioss. is one of Iranian endemic spurges (2) which few phytochemical studies have been reported for this plant. Some species of this genus are used in folk medicines to cure skin diseases, gonorrhea, migraines, intestinal parasites, and warts (1) which most of them have been proved by modern phytochemical and pharmacological studies. In Iran, they are also used as a purgative.",

Considering the huge demand for finding new drugs for viral infections, specially acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anti HIV activity of the extracted triterpenoids plus the four previously reported ingenoid diterpenes from E. erythradenia (Figure 2), were evaluated, using single cycle replicable HIV virions. In order to find the important structural features of anti HIV-1 active compounds, ligand-protein binding studies were carried out using AutoDock software.",

Filtration and under vacuum evaporation resulted in a green gum (433.2 g, 15.47% of dried powder weight), that was suspended in 1 liter methanol 80% and fractionated with hexane (1 lit \u00d7 3) which led to 51.3 g (1.83% of dried powder weight) hexane fraction. Methanolic suspension was further fractionated three times with 1 liter of chloroform that resulted in 37.7g chloroform fraction (1.35% of dried powder weight). Chloroform fraction was subjected to silica gel column, using hexane/chloroform (30\u2192100) and chloroform/methanol (0\u219220), to render several fractions: F1-4. Subsequently, the richest fraction in triterpenoids, F2 (based on TLC visualization after cerium sulfate solvent spraying and heating), was chromatographed on silica gel C.C. (hexane/ethyl acetate, 0\u219260) to afford five subfractions; TF2a-TF2e. Subfractions were injected into preparative HPLC using hexane/ethyl acetate gradient system at detection wavelength of 270 nm. Fractions were inspected and combined using TLC and heating after acidic cerium sulfate solvent spraying which resulted into pure compounds: TF2b1 (1a & 1b, 15 mg), TF2c2 (2, 18 mg), TF2d5 (3, 13mg). Moreover F3 was subjected to column of silica gel and washed with hexane/ethyl acetate (0\u219220). Then TF3.101-103 subfractions were combined and recrystallized with cold chloroform which resulted to compound TF3.101 (4, 26 mg). ",

Pseudotyped SCR HIV-1 virions were constructed by co-transfection of HEK 293T cells with pmzNL4-3 (containing deleted genome), psPAX2, and pMD2G plasmids obtained from Addgene (www.addgene.org). The pmzNL4-3 plasmid encodes the HIV-1 full-length RNA, with packaging ability containing the aforementioned deletion in the Pol region; the psPAX2 plasmid encodes HIV Gag and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins, besides all the HIV-1 accessory proteins; and the pMD2G plasmid encodes the vesicular stomatitis virus surface glycoprotein (VSVG), which is required for assembly and the budding process of virus. These pseudotyped virions have the ability of infecting a broad spectrum of cell, even without the CD4 receptor (including Hela cells).",

In this way, taking one peak of each two close peaks, plus the remaining carbons of side chain, two methyl groups (2 CH3), two methylene groups (CH2 and =CH2), two methine groups (CH and CHO), and an olefinic quaternary carbon were involved in side chain which totally were in accordance of EI-MS m/z 315 [M \u2013 127]+ and 297 [M \u2013 H2O \u2013 127] as a result of side chain fragmentation.

A triplet peak at \u03b4H 4.02 (J = 6.4 Hz) with the integration equals to one hydrogen, demonstrated neighboring oxygenated methine to an aliphatic CH2 in one side and quaternary carbon in another side.

Furthermore, a carbonyl group (\u03b4C 183.2) was identified that along with the loss of m/z = 45 at EI-MS indicated the presence of a carboxylic acid functional group. The presence of a carboxylic group and a double bond, taking together with seven degrees of unsaturation, supported pentacyclic structure of compound 4.
