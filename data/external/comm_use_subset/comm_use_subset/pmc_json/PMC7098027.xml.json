            "text": "Macroautophagy or autophagy refers to an evolutionarily conserved process in which the intracellular components such as protein aggregates and damaged organelles are engulfed into a double-membrane structure called autophagosome, which eventually fuses with lysosome to form autolysosome for degradation 6, 7 (Figure 1). The whole autophagy process is controlled by a group of proteins encoded by autophagy-related-genes (ATGs) in several consecutive stages 8, 9. First, the induction or initiation stage is controlled by the ULK1/Atg1 complex, downstream of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Second, the nucleation/expansion/elongation stage is mediated by the ATG14-Beclin1-hVPS34/class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) complex, as well as the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems (ATG5-ATG12 and LC3/ATG8). The third and last stage of autophagy is the maturation/fusion/degradation in which autophagosome fuses with lysosome to form autolysosome where the luminal contents are degraded (Figure 1). At present, the biological functions of autophagy have been extensively studied. Autophagy plays an important role in various physiological and pathological processes, including cell survival, cell death, aging, immunity and metabolism 10, 11. More importantly, accumulating evidence has highlighted the importance of autophagy in many human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, as well as immunity and infection 12, 13. Among them, the implication of autophagy in viral infection has also been widely investigated and deeply appreciated.",

In addition to autophagy as described above, lysosome receives cargos from other processes including endocytosis through the endocytic pathway. Briefly, following endocytosis, internalized cargos first enter the early endosomes (EE) where the cargos are sorted for two destinations: they are either retrieved for recycling to the plasma membrane/the secretory pathway, or are delivered to the late endosome (LE) and then fuse with lysosome for degradation 20, 21. The main biological functions of the endocytic pathway are for retrieval and recycling of internalized cargo proteins, and such functions are known to play critical roles in the pathology of important human diseases, in particularly neurodegenerative diseases and viral infection 22, 23.",

At present, various reports have converged onto two important questions: whether CoV induces autophagy and whether the autophagy machinery or ATG proteins are involved in the infection and replication of CoVs. The first report demonstrating the involvement of autophagy in viral replication was based on MHV 24, in which the authors made several important observations. First, MHV induced the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), with resemblance to autophagosome, a hallmark of autophagy. Second, the viral replication complexes at DMVs co-localized with the autophagy proteins, LC3 and ATG12. Third and more importantly, MHV replication was impaired in ATG5 knockout embryonic stem cells. Therefore, the authors concluded that autophagy is implicated in the formation of DMV as well as in the replication of MHV 24. In a follow-up study, the same group also examined the SARS-CoVs and found similar colocalization of the key viral replication proteins with endogenous LC3, a protein marker for autophagosome 25, suggesting a similar function of autophagy in the replication of SARS-CoVs. Cottam et al used another CoV (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) and found that one of the key viral replicase protein nsp6 is capable of inducing autophagy 26. Notably, this nsp6 also presents in MHV and SARS-CoV, and thus it would be of interest to further test the effects of nsp6 in these two CoVs on autophagy.",

For instance, in Vero cells infected with SARS-CoVs, Snijder et al failed to detect colocalization of LC3 or GFP-LC3 with the viral replication- transcription complexes of SARS-CoV examined using immunofluorescence staining 27. Further studies also demonstrated that either ATG5 or ATG7, two of the key autophagy proteins in control of autophagosome biogenesis, is not required for viral replication in cells infected by MHV 28, 29 or by SARS-CoVs 30. In those studies, cells with deletion of either ATG5 or ATG7 failed to impair the viral replication rate. Similarly, virus infection was not inhibited by the knockdown of ATG5 26. Thus, all these observations suggest that the autophagy machinery is not directly implicated in the viral replication process.",

Consistently, a more recent report found that MERS-CoV blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and induction of autophagy reduces the replication of MERS-CoV 32. Thus, it appears that there is certain type of interplay between the autophagy machinery and CoVs, and the exact nature of such interaction remains to be further elucidated.",

Among them, the endocytic pathway is considered to be particularly important and has been extensively studied. As discussed earlier, CoVs are enveloped and plus-strand RNA virus and they contain a set of four proteins that encapsidate the viral genomic RNA: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the spike glycoprotein (S) 34. Among them, the function of the S protein is mainly involved in the process of viral entry into the host cells via proteolytic cleavage to form two subunits, S1 and S2 35. These two subunits have distinct functions: S1 is responsible for receptor-binding, while S2 is mainly for membrane fusion and both are essential for viral entry via the endocytic pathway and infection into the host cells.",

However, it was later found that ACE2 protein expresses abundantly in the epithelia of the human lung and small intestine 42. Since SARS-CoV-2 also binds to the same ACE2 receptor as SARS-CoV 5 and SARS-CoV-2 is also susceptible to the inhibitory effect of chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomotropic agent 43, it is highly possible that this new CoV utilizes the same endocytic pathway for entry into the host cells.

At present, it has been well studied that CQ has a wide-spectrum of anti-viral effects including anti-CoVs, anti-HIV, and anti-type A and B influenza viruses 58. The anti-viral effects of CQ and its analogs have been reviewed elsewhere 59. Here we would like to focus on the effect of CQ on CoVs, as summarized in Table 2. For instance, CQ has been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro via a screening of an FDA-approved compound library 60. Treatment with CQ at a clinically relevant concentration, either before or after SARS-CoV infection into the Vero E6 cells, was found to be effective in suppressing viral infection, indicating its application in both prophylactic and therapeutic conditions 47. Similar results were also found in another lysosomotropic agent, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) 47. It is known that the cleavage of the Spike Glycoprotein (S protein) by proteases is required for the SARS-CoV entry to the cells via a pH-dependent manner 45. Mechanistically, it is believed that the neutralization of endo-lysosomal pH by CQ inhibits the protease activities and prevents the cleavage of S protein and subsequently impairs the viral entry into the host cell. Interestingly, Wang et al showed that in cells treated with CQ, NH4Cl or Bafilomycin A1 (an endo/lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor), the viral receptor ACE2 was trapped within perinuclear vacuoles 38, suggesting that these lysosomotropic agents may also affect the function of ACE2. Since ACE2 serves as the viral receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, such observations further support the notion for the potent anti-viral activity of those lysosomotropic agents. Indeed, a very recent study showed that CQ inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection at both entry and post-entry stages in Vero E6 cells 43.",

However, the usage of CQ phosphate should be evaluated carefully as it may also have side effects such as retinopathy 64 and cautions should be taken for close monitoring of the potential side effect throughout the whole treatment period. The dosage should be reduced or stopped if reduction in haemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count and platelet count, or the eyesight are observed. In addition, since CQ is the substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which are responsible for the metabolism of multiple drugs, it might interfere with other medications such as digitoxin (a cardiac glycoside) and tamoxifen (used for treatment of breast cancer).

K11777 is another cysteine protease inhibitor that has been reported to block the entry of SARS-CoV at the sub-nanomolar range 66. In addition, teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic and its derivatives inhibit the entry of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV by inhibition of cathepsin L activity 55. Interestingly, a serine protease inhibitor camostat was known to inhibit transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and effectively protected the mice against death caused by SARS-CoV infection 55. More importantly, a very recent study showed that camostat can also block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 67.

At present, while the exact role of autophagy remains debatable, there is overwhelming evidence suggesting that the endocytic pathway plays a key role in mediating viral entry for many CoVs including SARS-CoVs, MERS-CoVs and possibly SARS-CoV-2. As a result, several inhibitors targeting the endocytic pathway appear to have the therapeutic potential in treatment of COVID-19, including a lysosomotropic agent CQ and a clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor chlorpromazine 43, 63, 65, 68.
