In the literature, the spectrum of illness attributed to EV-D68 ranges from asymptomatic to severe respiratory infection requiring hospitalization particularly in children with previous history of asthma or wheezing; however the full spectrum of disease is not yet known [4, 6\u20138]. A possible association with neurological syndromes such as acute flaccid paralysis was noted during the 2014 increase in the US of EV-D68, and some individuals presenting with acute flaccid paralysis (now classified as acute flaccid myelitis) had EV-D68 detected in respiratory specimens. A recent investigation of hospital patients presenting with acute flaccid myelitis [9] reported an association of EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis; however, the connection between EV-D68 infection and neurological syndromes remains unclear and causality has not been determined [10,11].",

Subsequently, all positive specimens were subjected to a semi-nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the VP1 gene coding for the capsid protein followed by Sanger sequencing with Bigdye V3.1 kit (Life Technologies Inc. California, USA) to amplify of a 375 bp partial VP1 region for serotype identification)[17]. A similar testing method was performed at NML, with sequencing performed by the Genomics core facility at NML [18]. Sequences were assembled using Sequencer 5.2.4 and compared to VP1 sequences in GenBank using BLAST. NML also employed an EV-D68 strain-specific real-time reverse transcription PCR test [19]. Testing at PHOL continued until December 1, 2014 and it was also performed retrospectively for some patients from whom specimens were submitted before September.",

In the event more than one specimen was submitted per patient, specimen collection date of the first specimen submitted was used and the setting that indicated the highest clinical severity (e.g. hospitalized vs. community dwelling) was used to describe disease severity. Percent positivity and descriptions of EV-D68 cases by timing of specimen collection, age, sex, setting, symptoms and local health unit of residence were analysed at the patient level. Reports of other viruses identified in addition to EV-D68 and specimen type were described at the specimen level.

From 1987 until 2014, EV-D68 had been rarely reported in the US [20], however the number of cases reported in 2014 increased sharply, and was much higher than previously reported [21]. In Ontario, EV-D68 may have circulated prior to 2014 not all enteroviruses are typed and not all test methods are able to distinguish between rhinovirus and enterovirus. Routine viral culture and MRVP testing did not detect enterovirus and EV-D68 viruses in 95.9% and 60.3% of PCR-positive specimens, respectively. In addition neither viral culture nor MRVP could distinguish EV-D68 from rhinovirus in 1.3% and 36.4% of specimens tested by each method, respectively.

Firstly, PHOL was not the only laboratory that performed EV-D68 testing in Ontario since the Regional Virology Laboratory in Hamilton Ontario and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa also performed EV-D68 testing. As well, some hospitals may have forwarded their specimens directly to NML. Hence, these results do not represent all EV-D68 detections in Ontario. In addition, physicians may not routinely test patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and some patients with EV-D68 with mild symptoms likely did not present for care; therefore cases reported in this investigation underestimate the true incidence of this virus.",

            "text": "Secondly, for the purposes of this investigation, testing for EV-D68 was performed by PHOL and NML. Different test methods for enterovirus detection were used by each laboratory, which may have different sensitivity and specificity and consequently may have affected the number of positive results reported in this study. Thirdly, information about at-risk groups (e.g. children, particularly those with asthma) requiring hospitalization as a result of EV-D68 had been communicated broadly to clinicians. Hence, it is not possible to determine if requests for testing for EV-D68 by health care providers was requested more frequently for these specific population groups as opposed to broadly testing individuals of any age regardless of setting type. In addition, some clinicians may have been more likely to test than others, which would impact the number of EV-D68 positive specimens attributed to any given health unit. Finally, reviewing patients\u2019 charts would have been the optimal method by which to obtain clinical information such as patients\u2019 symptoms and clinical outcomes. At PHOL, we are reliant on information supplied by clinicians on the laboratory requisition. Unfortunately, symptoms and patient\u2019s setting were not consistently reported on the requisition. In addition, even when reported, they reflect one specific period during the clinical course of disease. As a result, we are unable to report on clinical severity of disease, and/ or clinical outcome.",

Although most of the patients were hospitalized there was no difference in hospitalization status between cases and controls. Most cases reported respiratory symptoms, and the virus was only detected in respiratory specimens. In order to better understand the epidemiology of this virus, surveillance for EV-D68 should include testing of symptomatic individuals regardless of treatment setting (including ambulatory care settings) patient age, along with collection and analysis of comprehensive clinical and epidemiological data.",
