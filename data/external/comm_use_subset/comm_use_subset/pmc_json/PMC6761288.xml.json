Almost all children will have been infected with RSV by age two, with about 3% requiring hospitalization. A recent report estimated that in 2015 about 33.1 million children worldwide under age 5 had RSV-related acute lower respiratory infection; of those, approximately 10% required hospitalization with 59,000 in-hospital fatalities1. The incidence and mortality of RSV vary between geographic locations, with children from developing countries considered to be at higher risk4. In the United States, 20% of infants require outpatient treatment for RSV-related illnesses, with an associated economic burden of $1.9 billion5; around 3% of these cases are associated with serious bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia\u2013the most common forms of severe RSV infection. In addition to major risk factors such as congenital or chronic cardiopulmonary disease, meta-analyses have identified additional risk factors for RSV, including preterm birth, low birth weight, siblings at home, day-care attendance, and maternal smoking6\u20138. Infants with RSV infection in early childhood are also at a higher risk of developing asthma and wheezing9\u201311. Although prophylactic treatments are available to prevent RSV infection in the most at-risk infants, attempts are ongoing to identify an effective and safe vaccine or small molecule drug to reduce the health burden of RSV.",

The RSV disease severity was measured by the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS). This allowed us to divide infants into two groups based on severity: mild and severe (see Methods section). We emphasize that GRSS is a composite score that reflects the worst values during the entire illness, rather than a single time point, allowing us to address the problem of clinical variability among subjects. GRSS also recapitulates more frequently used factors such as viral load (which has been associated with RSV disease severity in several studies24,25) and need for hospitalization (Supplemental Fig. 1), thus acting as excellent surrogate for disease severity26. Among the infants, 23 had mild illness and 35 had severe illness. There was no difference in any demographic characteristics between mildly and severely ill subjects (Table 1). The data collection occurred in three stages (Fig. 2A).",

This analysis indicated that enrollment season was a significant contributor to structure in our expression data. Therefore, we applied batch-correction to remove this signal from the data. We then performed differential expression analysis, comparing the expression levels of genes between the acute and follow-up visit. We identified 27 genes that were differentially expressed at a Benjamini-Hotchberg false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 (Fig. 2C). Many of the genes that had higher expression levels in the acute visit are known to be important in mediating host immune response. This included IFITM1 and IFITM2, which are known to inhibit the infection and replication of respiratory syncytial virus27,28, IFI27, a known biomarker for RSV29, and IRF7, a gene associated with suppression of innate immunity response30. Other genes with known associations to RSV and higher expression in the acute visit included SOCS331, MX132, and the ISGylation pathway genes USP18 and ISG1533. Our analysis also identified several genes with higher expression in the follow-up visit, including MS4A1, which encodes the CD20 protein, and MCOLN1. CD20 + B cells are prominent in the lung tissue of infants with fatal RSV infection34,35 and MS4A1 is upregulated in infants after the administration of live attenuated influenza vaccine, indicating an association with immune system processes36. RSV activates innate immunity through the toll like receptor (TLR) pathway. MCOLN1 has been associated with TLR signaling through modulating viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) along with trafficking of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into lysosomes37,38. MCOLN1 also regulates autophagy39, as expected in the convalescence phase of an infection.",

We evaluated the differential variability in gene expression levels between mild versus severe samples using the F-test and identified 641 (5.5%) genes that were differentially variable at an FDR significance threshold of 0.05.

We also applied MaAsLin (Multivariate association Analysis with Linear modeling) to test for significant relationships between microbial taxa and clinical outcome, after adjusting for sex, race, and enrollment season45. At a nominal p-value of 0.05, this analysis identified one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) \u2013 H. influenza \u2013 as positively associated with severity, and two OTUs \u2013 Ralstonia and Streptococcus \u2013 as negatively associated with severity. We also assessed the influence of visit and infection severity on the microbiome composition by using two measures to quantify the \u03b1-diversity: (1) observed number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e., the OTU richness and (2) the Shannon index46. We found that both \u03b1-diversity measures have higher values for infants with severe infection compared to those with mild infection during the acute visit (Visit 1), as well as higher values in the acute as compared to the post-acute visit (Visit 3) for infants with severe infection (Fig. 2F,G). In particular, the Shannon diversity is significantly different between severe versus mild samples in Visit 1 (p-value = 0.011), and between the Visit 1 and Visit 3 samples among infants with severe RSV infection (p-value = 0.0057). The infection score was estimated during Visit 1 (the acute phase).

Interestingly, these relationships are not limited to the top few PCs, which are normally the primary focus of dimension reduction analysis. Instead, these relationships highlight that prominent patterns in microbiome data may be associated with more subtle patterns in gene expression, and vice versa.",

In this context, the identification of mitochondrial genes in our integrative analysis is an especially intriguing finding.

Furthermore, highly plausible biological pathways related to viral processes and immune response were implicated in RSV severity using this integrative analysis. These pathways were not found using more standard approaches, such as differential-expression analysis in the context of infection severity, and despite the fact that we did observe some immune genes differentially-expressed between the acute and post-acute visits.

This integrative analysis allowed us to systematically quantify relationships among the nasal microbiome, host transcriptome, and disease severity for RSV infection. Our results suggest that certain associations between the microbiome and transcriptome are modulated based on RSV infection severity, and that particular microbial taxa impact host immune response, with a key role for mitochondrial genes. Overall, these findings on microbiome-transcriptome associations provides novel insights into how the immune system mounts a response against RSV. Based on our findings, a key future direction for our group is to study the potential mechanisms by which the nasal microbiome impacts host immune response, such as how gene regulation is altered or otherwise affected by microbial composition, or how nasal bacteria influence the severity of RSV from a pathophysiologic perspective.",

To achieve that, we used the prcomp() function in the stats (version 3.4.3) package in R to perform PCA on the OTU relative abundance profiles and the FPKM-normalized RNA-Seq gene expression profiles (after applying batch-effect correction for enrollment season). In this integrative analysis, we restricted ourselves to samples from 40 subjects with both microbiome and transcriptome data collected during Visit 1. The top 13 gPCs and top 10 cPCs, which explained 95% of the variance in the transcriptomic and microbiomic data, respectively, were selected for further analysis.",
