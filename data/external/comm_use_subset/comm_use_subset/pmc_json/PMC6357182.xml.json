These human-pathogenic coronaviruses cause a broad range of clinical manifestations. HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 cause mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. In contrast, SARS-CoV and the recently emerged MERS-CoV may cause severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts [4,5,6,7].",

Second, lipids and lipid synthesis play important roles in the formation and function of the viral replication complex [10,11]. Third, lipid metabolism can generate the required energy for efficient viral replication [12]. Moreover, lipids can dictate the proper cellular distribution of viral proteins, as well as the trafficking, assembly, and release of virus particles [13,14]. In this regard, the host lipid biogenesis pathways play indispensable roles in modulating virus propagation.",

            "text": "As in other viruses, lipids play key roles in the life cycle of coronaviruses. Coronaviruses confiscate intracellular membranes of the host cells to generate new compartments known as double membrane vesicles (DMVs) for the amplification of the viral genome. DMVs are membranous structures that not only harbor viral proteins but also contain a specific array of hijacked host factors, which collectively orchestrate a unique lipid micro-environment optimal for coronavirus replication [15]. A recent study indicated that a key lipid processing enzyme, cytosolic phospholipase A2\u03b1 enzyme (cPLA2\u03b1) that belongs to the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily, was closely associated with DMVs\u2019 formation and coronaviruses\u2019 replication [16]. The viral protein and RNA accumulation, as well as the production of infectious virus progeny, were significantly diminished in the presence of cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor [16]. At the same time, phospholipase A2 group IID (PLA2G2D), an enzyme that predominantly contributes to anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving lipid mediator expression, contributed to worsened outcomes in mice infected with SARS-CoV by modulating the immune response [17]. However, to date, the change and modulating effects of the specific lipids involved in lipid rearrangement upon coronavirus infection remains largely unexplored.",

            "text": "To obtain a comprehensive and unbiased profile of perturbed lipids upon coronavirus infection, we performed mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics profiling on coronavirus-infected cells using HCoV-229E as a model virus. Specific lipids including glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) upon virus infection were identified, which represented the lipid species that were rearranged by HCoV-229E infection. Further pathway analysis revealed that the linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism axis was the most perturbed pathway upon HCoV-229E infection. Importantly, supplement of additional LA and AA to coronavirus-infected cells significantly inhibited virus replication of both HCoV-229E and the highly virulent MERS-CoV, suggesting that the LA\u2013AA metabolism axis is a common and essential pathway that could modulate coronavirus replication. In this regard, temporal modulation of the host lipid profile is a potential novel strategy to combat emerging human coronaviruses.",

MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 strain) was kindly provided by Professor Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E were cultured in VeroE6 cells in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin as we described previously [19,20,21]. The supernatants were harvested when cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed and centrifuged to generate the viral stocks. The viral stocks were titrated by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C as previously described [22,23]. Briefly, confluent VeroE6 cells were infected with 10-fold serial viral dilutions. The cells were incubated with diluted viruses at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and subsequently overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde as the plaques were observed and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet. All experiments involving live MERS-CoV followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 3 facility as previously described [24,25,26,27].",

These ion features were significantly discriminative between HCoV-229E-infected and mock-infected cells. To observe the discrimination trend in more detail, a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on the degree of similarity of lipid abundance profiles to show the overview trend of all significant ion features. As indicated in Figure 1, most of the significant features from both negative mode (Figure 1A) and positive mode (Figure 1B) expressed an up-regulation trend after HCoV-229E infection compared with the mock infection controls. Furthermore, to identify lipids specific to HCoV-229E infection, these significant features were grouped and annotated using the CAMERA software, and the potential precursor ions were used to perform further MS/MS experiments for obtaining their fragmentation patterns. Finally, a total of 24 lipids were identified, which could be classified into three lipid classes, including lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE) and fatty acid (FA). The chromatogram peak heights of these identified lipids were generated by LC-MS raw data and the ratio between infected and mock-infected cells was determined. As demonstrated in Figure 2, we found a consistent up-regulation trend of the identified lipids in HCoV-229E-infected cells. In particular, lysoPC was the predominant lipid class of all identified, accounting for approximately 60% of all identified lipids with significant elevation (Figure 2A). At the same time, arachidonic acid (AA), which belongs to the FA class, showed the highest increase in fold-change among all identified lipids with a maximum of 7.1-fold increase (Figure 2B). In addition, the level of lysoPEs (Figure 2C) was also up-regulated with a maximum fold change of 2.93, which was comparatively less than that of the lysoPCs and FAs. The identities of lysoPC (16:0/0:0), platelet-activating factor C-16 (PAF C-16), lysoPE (16:0/0:0), AA, LA, PA and OA were confirmed by matching the retention time (RT) and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the authentic chemical standards that distinguish between HCoV-229E-infected cases and non-infected controls (Figure 3). The detailed information of the 24 identified lipids was listed in Table 1. MS/MS fragmentation patterns of five representative lipids and corresponding standards are also demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S2.",

Upon HCoV-229E infection, the glycerophospholipids, as main components of the cell membrane, were metabolized to lysophospholipids and FAs after cPLA2 enzyme activation. Lysophospholipids such as lysoPCs and lysoPEs were correspondingly increased after HCoV-229E infection. Moreover, lysoPCs could be further metabolized to platelet-activating factor. FAs were also released from glycerophospholipids but only LA and AA could initiate downstream pathways to generate corresponding metabolites. The up-regulation of both lysophospholipids and FAs were partially confirmed by authentic standards. Furthermore, to investigate the downstream pathways trend of FAs, the authentic standards were also applied in LC-MS method to confirm whether these downstream lipids were changed correspondingly. As illustrated in Figure 5, AA is a downstream lipid of LA and the origin lipid of AA metabolism pathway. The identity of AA was confirmed by authentic standard (Supplementary Figure S2D), which was found to be significantly up-regulated. Therefore, combining pathway analysis and the authentic standards verification results, our data suggested that the LA\u2013AA metabolism axis was the most significantly perturbed pathway and might be associated with lipids rearrangement or other processes in HCoV-229E infection.",

The LA and AA were mapped and played a vital role in the perturbed LA-AA metabolism axis (Figure 5). In contrast, PA and OA were not mapped in the perturbed pathway and may only be produced from glycerophospholipids due to cPLA2 enzyme activation. Huh-7 cells were infected with HCoV-229E and treated with AA, LA, PA, or OA. The cell lysates and culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h post-infection to determine the viral genome copy number by RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure 6, LA and AA consistently inhibited the replication of HCoV-229E as evidenced by the decrease in virus genome copies in both cell lysate (Figure 6A,C) and supernatant samples (Figure 6B\u2013D). In contrast, PA inhibited HCoV-229E replication only when supplied at high concentration while HCoV-229E replication was largely independent of OA (Figure 6A\u2013D).",

Twenty of these 24 (83.3%) lipids were lysoPC and lysoPE. LysoPC is the most abundant lysophospholipid in humans, with a high plasma concentration of several hundred micromoles. In addition, lysoPC was a potent inhibitor and could reversely arrest pore expansion during syncytium formation mediated by diverse viral fusogens [40]. Another lysophospholipid, lysoPE, is present at low concentrations in vivo but they induce various cellular responses such as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and neuronal differentiation when applied to cells in vitro [41]. Among the identified FAs, the LA and AA both belong to polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid and are essential fatty acids. In addition, LA is the metabolic precursor of AA, both of which are key components of the cell membrane. LA and AA also play fundamental roles in the biological function of many tissues by modulating enzymes, ion channels, receptors, as well as inflammation [42].",

However, when we evaluate this hypothesis by exogenously supplementing additional LA and AA to HCoV-229E- or MERS-CoV-infected cells, we noticed a significant reduction in virus replication. Taken together, our data suggested that coronavirus infection did not randomly perturb the cellular lipid compositions. Instead, we speculate that coronaviruses precisely modulate and rearrange the host lipid profile to reach an intricate homeostasis optimized for its replication. Any exogenous manipulation that disrupts the equilibrium may interfere with the optimal replication of the viruses. Alternatively, supplementing LA and AA might disturb the LA\u2013AA metabolism axis and result in feedback reversion of lysophospholipids into phospholipids through Land\u2019s cycle [44], thus limiting virus replication.
