They either enhance or inhibit inflammation in response to pathogens, \u201cnon-self\u201d molecules, and toxins. Cytokines allow context-dependent communication within the body [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. If the interactions that lead to cytokine production are destabilized, a \"cytokine storm\" (or hypercytokinemia) can result, producing unbridled inflammation within tissues and key organs. Cytokine storms are associated with sepsis and septic shock [6], influenza, acute respiratory distress [7], host response to blood transfusion or bone marrow transplantation, and toxic response to medication. They have been implicated in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and the H5N1 avian influenza infections first recognized in 1987 [8], [9].",

TGN1412 is a genetically engineered CD28 antibody agonist that can activate T cells without a co-stimulatory antigen signal [12], [11]. The drug\u2019s manufacturer saw a potential application in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, whose T-cell population had been destroyed by chemotherapy along with the cancerous B cells. They also saw potential applications in boosting regulatory T cells to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where effector T cells become overactive and pathogenic [12].",

            "text": "With efficacy demonstrated in animal models, Phase I clinical trials were scheduled for testing in humans. In March 2006, six healthy male volunteers received TGN1412, and two volunteers received a placebo. Great care was taken in establishing a dosage that was deemed to be safe in humans [12]. Within an hour of infusion, the six who received the drug experienced adverse effects while those who received placebo did not. The drug\u2019s recipients had headaches, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, decreased blood pressure, and increased heart rate, all indications of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [13], [11]. Severe depletion of lymphocytes and monocytes occurred four hours after drug infusion and continued until the fourth day. C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and neutrophil concentrations increased well above normal levels during the same time period. Eventually, all six patients experienced multi-organ failure, with infiltrates in the lung, intravascular coagulation, renal failure, and lung injury [11]. Critical care and subsequent treatment included dialysis, mechanical ventilation, and, in one case, surgery to counter peripheral ischemia [11], [14]. The periods of illness extended beyond one month and may have induced permanent damage for all patients. Biological explanations of the event are offered in [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Infection, underlying disease, or endotoxins did not cause this unique event; hence, it allowed unusual insight into the course and impact of immune-mediated cytokine storms. The analysis presented here particularly focused on time-dependent coupled interactions among the nine cytokines measured. The ability of the model to capture dynamics suggests that the nonlinearities and complexities of cytokine storms may not prove an insurmountable problem for mathematical biologists.",

Here, we present linear, time-invariant models whose parameters are estimated from the median time series data for the six TGN1412 clinical subjects [11]. The models describe the evolution of nine cytokine concentrations without regard to the cells that secrete or are affected by them; cellular sources and sinks reported in the literature are discussed in a later section. Separate second-order equations for the concentrations and rates-of-change of each cytokine are constructed, and best-fit time constants are found by numerical search. All nine cytokines are then analyzed concurrently in an eighteenth-order system. A unified search over all of the higher-order system\u2019s parameters improves the fit to the measured variables and provides an integrated model of the cytokine storm event. The coupled model illustrates multi-class interactions among the cytokines, identifies response modes and mode shapes (i.e., eigenvalues and eigenvectors), and reveals similarities in principal components. The data set, differential- and difference-equation models, and numerical search algorithm are described. The effects of uncertainty in initial conditions, exogenous effects, and parameter estimates are evaluated using a stochastic extension of the linear model.",

Supplementary material shows considerable patient-to-patient variation in cytokine profiles. Signal saturation limits for the cytometric bead array immunoassays were 5,000 pg/mL; thus, higher cytokine values could not be detected. Because individual signals frequently reached saturation limits during the first few days of the event, estimates of several peak cytokine levels (particularly IL6, IL10, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) may be conservative. The median rather than the mean (or average) for the six individuals is presented because saturation would bias the mean computation for the original data.",

The result suggests that TNF-\u03b1 concentration is not a driving factor on the dynamics of the cytokine network. This is not surprising, given the variable role of TNF-\u03b1 in immune cell biology [29]. Lack of IFN-\u03b3 induces more significant changes in IL10 and IL6.

The odd elements of B are zero, and the even elements are derived from the estimated initial rates (Table 1). Assuming that the clinical infusion lasts for 4 min and occurs at 2 mg/min or 2880 mg/day, B = (2880/8)x(0) = 360x(0). Maintaining a fixed dose of 8 mg, the TGN1412 infusion rate is inversely proportional to the infusion duration, tinfusion. We see the results of increasing the infusion duration from 4 minutes to 3 days in Fig. 12, with pharmacokinetic effects neglected. The 4-min\u2013infusion simulation is virtually identical to the results for instantaneous infusion. There is little change in profile for durations lasting several hours (not shown). For a one-day infusion duration at a rate of 0.0056 mg/min, several cytokine peaks remain close to their recorded values. Significant reduction in peak values requires infusion periods of 2\u20133 days, for which infusion rates are 1/720-1/960 of the trial values.

Each cytokine\u2019s response is assumed to be proportional to its current concentration and its current rate of change; thus, its response is represented by a second-order differential equation. Nine interacting cytokines are, therefore, represented by an eighteenth-order system. Coefficients of the model are found by minimizing an error cost function using the downhill-simplex method. The system model provides evidence for the regulation of cytokines by other cytokines, identifying inductive and inhibitive relationships among the nine cytokines as well as similarities in temporal histories.",

This effect would not be beneficial, as the period during which cytokines were at unacceptably high levels also would increase. This suggests that the drug, not the dose used during the trial, was the crux of the problem. Analysis of the data\u2019s principal components reveals that cytokine response profiles fall into three groups: [TNF-\u03b1, IL1, and IL10], [IFN-\u03b3, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12], and [IL6]. Association of these cytokines with cellular secretion and regulation suggest that the adaptive immune system had a dominant effect in the cytokine storm (perhaps unsurprising, given the source of the stimulus). As suggested by the literature review, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL8, was most likely produced by innate system cells and non-immune tissue.",
