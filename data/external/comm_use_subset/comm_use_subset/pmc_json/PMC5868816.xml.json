            "text": "The role of bats as potential or confirmed reservoirs of various viral agents with public health importance has been increasingly appreciated in recent years. Several bat-borne viruses are considered emerging, with an increase in the number of human cases and outbreaks over the past two decades; such as the bat-borne viruses Marburg virus and Nipah virus [1,2]. These viruses are associated with direct zoonotic transmission and infection of exposed human populations. Other identified bat-associated viruses are only related to viruses of known public health importance, like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [3\u20135]. Though no direct spillover have been identified, overall sequence similarities between human viral strains and related bat-borne viruses have implicated these viruses in the emergence of new human coronaviruses [6,7]. Detection of potentially zoonotic viruses in bat species has been the driving force for increased research and surveillance of the bat virome (as well as other infectious agents).",

The use of sequence-independent metagenomic approaches has enabled detection of highly divergent viruses, often sharing only low homologies to currently known virus species [11,14\u201317]. Viral metagenomic investigations provide opportunities for the detection of potentially zoonotic viruses, as well as other mammalian-infecting viruses not previously known to have been present [8,11,18]. An inventory of novel viruses can thus be constructed, and further investigated for their potential as zoonotic agents. Metagenomics and conventional PCR surveillance have identified bats as natural hosts for large genetic diversities of several viral families\u2014such as the Circoviridae, Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, and Adenoviridae, as well as the genus Hepacivirus, in the family Flaviviridae [6,10,19,20].",

Investigations have identified that both species host various viruses. The novel hantavirus, Mouyassu\u00e9 virus, was detected from archival specimens of two N. nana individuals collected in the Ivory Coast in West Africa [25]. In South Africa, novel paramyxovirus sequences were identified from the same host species [26]. Lastly, coronaviruses from both the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus have been reported from N. capensis species [27,28]. A detected lineage C betacoronavirus, named NeoCoV/PML-PHE1, grouped taxonomically within the same species as MERS-CoV [4,28]. The virus shared an overall nucleotide identity of 85.5\u201385.6% to human and camel strains of MERS-CoV, with only 64.3\u201364.6% amino acid identity within the spike gene that is responsible for receptor recognition and attachment [4].

Viral metagenomic sequencing provided an initial assessment of the virome composition from gastrointestinal samples at a host genus-level, detecting sequences from several viral families. However, sequencing outputs produced fragmented coverage of several viruses, making sequence diversity difficult to discern, and lacked suitable sequencing depth as some viruses were only detected from sequencing reads-data. Three viral families (Coronaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae) were selected for further investigation by analysing samples pooled per host species. Conventional nucleic acid detection based on conserved gene regions confirmed diverse sequences of adenoviruses and herpesviruses, as well as the recovery of the complete coding genome of another MERS-related virus.",

Bats were measured for morphological identification [21,30], and either released after sampling or taken as voucher specimens and deposited in the small mammal collection at the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History (Pretoria, SA). Further species confirmation was sought for individuals from which coronavirus RNA was detected with sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene [31]. All specimen material collected including faecal pellets, as well as rectal and intestinal tissues from necropsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C after returning to the laboratory.",

The study focused on samples from the lower gastrointestinal tract (faecal, rectal and intestinal samples), to identify viruses present in these tissues or excreted in faecal material (Fig 2A; S1 Table). Due to the size of these bat species and small quantities of faecal material at times available for collection, sample material for certain individuals were limited. All faecal or tissue samples were used sparingly to enable additional analyses. However, priority was given to sample preparation for high throughput sequencing in order to determine the virome composition of the analysed host genus. Therefore, if sample material consisted of very small quantities of faecal or rectal material, these samples were completely used for this step. For high throughput sequencing sample preparation, faecal and rectal samples of all bats were pooled and processed by mechanical homogenization in 400 \u03bcl PBS (Lonza) with two stainless-steel beads (Qiagen). A Tissue Lyser II system (Qiagen) was utilized, shaking at 30Hz for 60 seconds. The lysates were cleared by low temperature (4\u00b0C) centrifugation for 10 minutes at 10,000x g. Cleared supernatants were pooled and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcM cellulose acetone syringe filter (Corning Incorporated) to remove large particulate matter. The filtrate was ultracentrifuged at 130 000 x g for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcl PBS and DNase treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion) before total nucleic acid extraction (ZR Viral DNA/RNA Kit, Zymo Research). Total nucleic acids were eluted in 35 \u03bcl nuclease free water (Ambion) and further depleted of ribosomal RNA with the RiboMinus\u2122 Eukaryote System v2 (Ambion); nucleic acids were eluted in 12 \u03bcl nuclease free water (Ambion).",

The BLAST xml output files were subsequently exported to the MetaGenome Analyzer (MEGAN v6) [34] for taxonomic assignments, and were further manually investigated. Combinations of assembly approaches were employed including CLC Bio Genomics workbench assembly, and assemblies in Velvet 1.2.10 [35] of all host depleted reads as well assemblies only after family-level identified reads were exported from MEGAN.

Given it meets the ICTV criteria for species demarcation, we propose the new species, Neoromicia-associated cyclovirus 1 (strain 19681/RSA) within the genus Cyclovirus. Interestingly, the closest relative of the putative new Neoromicia cyclovirus originated from human stool; with an overall nucleotide identity of 64.9%, and amino acid similarities of 73.3% and 49.1% for the Rep protein and capsid protein, respectively.

The host species was confirmed by morphological identification and cytochrome C barcode analysis [21,31]. The Neoromicia alphacoronaviruses form an independent lineage with genetically similar members detected throughout the geographic distribution of the N. capensis host species [27,28]. BtCoVNeoromicia1787/LP/RSA/2013 was utilized as a lineage representative for these Neoromicia alphacoronaviruses in Fig 8 (as the other sequences were of an insufficient length for comparison). The closest relatives to this lineage was a Nyctalus lysleri bat alphacoronavirus (BNM98-30/BGR/2008) from Bulgaria, as well as a clade containing the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoVNL63) and related Triaenops bat viruses from Kenya [36,77,78]. The Neoromicia and Nyctalus alphacoronaviruses shared between 75.5\u201379.2% nucleotide identities to HCoVNL63, which is somewhat lower than the similarities of the NL63-related Triaenops bat viruses within this gene region (76\u201384% nucleotide identity) (S7 Table). Comparatively, Hipposideros bat coronaviruses identified in Ghana were suggested to have been possible early progenitors of the human alphacoronavirus HCoV229E [79], and shared greater similarities of 87\u201392% nucleotide identity to HCoV229E. Further surveillance and sequence analysis of the alphacoronaviruses from N. capensis may identify whether they can be considered as potential recombinant progenitors that may have participated in the emergence of HCoVNL63 [78].",

This virus shared 97.7% nucleotide identity to NeoCoV/PML-PHE1 within the compared RdRp gene region. This second variant was detected four years later, confirming the circulation of MERS-related viruses within the host genus. The complete coding genome of BtCoVNeo5038 (30009bp) was sequenced by further amplicon sequencing from 11 amplicons with 1000x coverage on Illumina\u2019s MiSeq platform. The 11 coding regions were in the characteristic coronavirus order, and compared to other lineage C betacoronaviruses (S8 Table). The overall genome similarities between BtCoVNeo5038 and its closest relative, NeoCoV/PML-PHE1, were 97.2% nucleotide identity and 98.5% amino acid similarity. The shared nucleotide identities of all genes were between 96\u201398.3% (98\u201399.5% amino acid similarities); with the gene sharing the lowest nucleotide similarity being the spike protein gene (96% nucleotide and 98.7% amino acid similarity). Due to similarities within the seven conserved ORFs required for species demarcation (97.7\u2013100% amino acid similarity) [76], BtCoVNeo5038 may also be assigned to the species, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus. The species includes the human and camel MERS-CoV strains, as well as the bat viruses NeoCoV/PML-PHE1 and PREDICT/PDF-2108 [4,5].

The currently identified diversity of bat-borne MERS-related viruses, however, are not sufficiently similar (particularly within the spike protein) to human/camel strains of MERS-CoV to be considered as the possible progenitors. This would mirror the identification of similar SARS-related coronaviruses from Rhinolophus hosts. After 11 years of continued surveillance within Rhinolophus species, the WIV1 strain capable of utilizing the same binding receptor as human SARS-CoV was finally detected [7].

Investigations focused in regions where the distributions of the known reservoir, dromedary camels, overlap with known vespertilionid bat hosts (such as N. capensis), would aid in ascertaining what viruses are circulating. Investigation of camels in these regions would also identify coronaviruses with the potential of recombining with other coronavirus species native to these hosts [81]. Overlapping distributions between dromedary camels and N. capensis, particularly where MERS antibody prevalence has been reported from camel populations in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula [50\u201355], indicate the best sampling localities as Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya (Fig 10). Coronavirus surveillance in these regions can be readily conducted with non-invasive sampling of bats and camels (collection of faecal material, oral swabs, and nasal secretions). Improved surveillance may yield additional stains of MERS-related viruses that could be used for isolation attempts in cell lines derived from bats, camels and human tissue. This may in turn allow for functional studies involving isolates that determine host susceptibility and permissibility.",

Marked limitations of the metagenomic approach implemented here were highlighted by inadequate sequencing of several viral families, which could subsequently be detected with conventional PCR assays; such as the adenoviruses, herpesviruses and coronaviruses. In spite of the lack of coronavirus contigs produced from the metagenomic data, the complete coding genome of a MERS-related betacoronavirus was still recovered with additional amplicon sequencing.

Follow up longitudinal studies can be implemented to confirm this finding and establish the total duration of the viral persistence. The Neoromicia adenovirus sequences shared high similarity to those identified in European bats, whereas the Neoromicia herpesviruses were much more diverse than previously identified bat-associated viruses. This observation may reflect differences in sampling efforts applied to each viral family. Further investigation of the identified viral families are required to sequence complete genes involved in receptor recognition and attachment to host cells. In the absence of viral isolates, this would allow functional assessment of the receptors utilized for cell entry, enable estimations of their potential to spread to new species, and assess the risks they pose to public or veterinary health. Lastly, the novel sequence data generated from the Neoromicia virome can be utilized in assay development for additional nucleic acid detection surveillance activities, to determine the prevalence rates of selected novel viruses.",
