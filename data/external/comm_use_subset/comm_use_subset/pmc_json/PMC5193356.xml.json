The latter is of interest as they can stay in the air for an extended period of time and travel long distances. Airborne transmission of viruses has been demonstrated for some diseases, including measles [1] and smallpox [2]. However, the airborne transmission of other well-known viruses like Influenza virus and Norovirus is still under investigation [3, 4]. Indoor environments are particularly advantageous for viral transmission, including hospital settings where transmission of nosocomial diseases is a major concern [4\u20136]. Other public or occupational spaces such as day care centers and wastewater treatment plants are also suspected to represent occupational hazards with respect to viral diseases [7, 8].",

Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity (RH) have a crucial impact on the infectivity of airborne viruses and can naturally help reduce viral concentrations in the air [9]. For example, infectivity of airborne Influenza viruses is minimal between 40% and 50% RH when compared to 20% and 70% RH [10]. Conversely, the infectivity of coronavirus is higher at 50% RH as compared to 20% and 80% RH [11]. Rhinovirus infectivity diminishes rapidly at 30% and 50% RH in comparison to 80% RH [12]. Therefore, the viral response to RH is virus-dependent.",

            "text": "Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages) are now widely used as models in aerosol studies [24]. They are relatively inexpensive to produce in large quantities and they do not require biosafety containment measures. Phages are highly diversified, and some of them possess structural similarities with human and animal viruses. Tailed phages with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), like phages T4 and T7, were used in several previous aerosol studies [24]. However, since eukaryotic viruses lack tails, non-tailed phage models have been utilized more often in recent years. RNA phage MS2 (Leviviridae family) is now one of the most used models in viral aerosol studies [24]. Phage MS2 is highly resistant to aerosolization and sampling, and represents a good surrogate of Newcastle disease virus [25]. Phages \u03d5X174 (Microviridae family), \u03d56 (Cystoviridae family), and PR772 (Tectiviridae family) have also been requently used [13, 15, 25\u201329]. Previous studies have demonstrated that phages \u03d56 and PR772 displayed resistance to aerosolization and air sampling similar to Influenza virus [25]. Phage \u03d56 has been thought to be a good model for Influenza virus because it is an enveloped virus with a segmented RNA genome. The pattern of resistance to relative humidity exhibited by phage \u03d56 (resistant at low RH, very sensitive at middle RH, sensitive at high RH) is similar to what has been described for the Influenza virus [10, 15].",

Fifty percent of the aerosols were collected during the first three minutes of air sampling with the SKC BioSampler as calculated with Eq 2 [32]. The initial concentration was considered to be 100% (Ci), the air input and output were 12.5 L/min, and the aerosol input was clean HEPA filtered air. During twenty minutes of air sampling with the SKC BioSampler 99% of the aerosols were collected from the chamber. Therefore, the chamber had to be filled for every time point tested, and thus, each set of test conditions was considered a separate experiment. All tested conditions and time points were repeated twice. Phages were also aerosolized without germicidal agents as control experiments.

In previous experiments, it has been demonstrated that viruses genomes are stable under air sampling conditions used in this study [15, 25, 33], therefor, qPCR was used to measure total phage genomes in all samples. The ratio of infectious phages in air samples was calculated by dividing the number of infectious phages as determined by plaque assays by the number of phage genomes estimated by qPCR. Because infectious ratio is affected by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR efficiency [27] as well as by aggregates in plaque assays, the value may be below or above 1. These assays bias are phage-specific and therefore, infectious ratios should not be used to compare phages. However, infectious ratios can be used to compare the effect of environmental conditions (relative humidity and exposure time) on each phage since the limitations are likely the same for all samples of the same phage.",

The univariate normality assumption was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk tests on the error distribution from the statistical model after a Cholesky factorization. The Brown and Forsythe's variation of Levene's test was used to verify the homogeneity of variances. When appropriate, some variables were log-transformed to fulfill the model assumptions. Reported p-values were based on these transformations. When these assumptions were not fulfilled, an alternative procedure called rank transformation was used. In a rank transformation the observations are replaced by their rank and an ordinary F-test from ANOVA is applied. This analysis does not depend on the assumptions required by the Brown and Forsythe\u2019s variation of Levene\u2019s test. This technique resulted into good statistical properties when compared to standard test. When results from raw or log-transformed data were compared with ranks and yielded similar results, data from the standard analyses were retained. When results differed, the rank transformation data was preferred. Posteriori comparisons were performed using Tukey\u2019s comparison test. Results were considered significant when p-values \u2264 0.05. Data were analyzed using the statistical package program SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.).",

However, the effect was only statistically significant for the two RNA phages, MS2 and \u03d56 (Figs 2 and 3). Surprisingly, the relative infectious ratios of phage \u03d56 were above one when aerosolized with MiST\u00ae (containing Triethylene glycol), which may suggest a protective effect on phage infectivity (Fig 3). Experiments using phage \u03d5X174, showed that the relative infectious ratios were below one with Pledge\u00ae, Eugenol, and H2O2 at 25% RH and with Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol at 50% RH (Fig 4). These data indicate that the chemicals reduced the infectivity of airborne phage \u03d5X174 compared to the reference values without germicidal product. The time spent airborne also has a strong effect on phage \u03d5X174 infectivity (Fig 1). For 1 hour and 2 hours of exposure at 50% RH, the impact of germicidal agents on the reduction of phage \u03d5X174 relative infectious ratios was less pronounced due to the effect of increased exposure time (Fig 4). The effects of germicidal agents on the four phages are summarized in Table 4. Others have also observed a virus-dependent response to sanitizing conditions. Coronavirus was shown to be 7\u201310 times more vulnerable to UV than Adenovirus and phage MS2 [18]. Phages T7 and MS2 were more resistant to ozone than \u03d56 and \u03d5X174 [13], while T7 was more resistant to UV than MS2, \u03d56, and \u03d5X174 [19].",

For example, ethanol- and isopropanol-based solutions (>30%) are slowly aerosolized compared to water-based solutions (more than 7 times longer to aerosolize the same volume). The Aeroneb Lab is widely used in drug delivery assays because it is non-destructive, can be used between 5 to 30 liters of air per minutes without influencing the liquid volume nebulized, and can aerosolise >0.2 ml of water-based solution per minute [38]. Since the composition of each of the germicidal agents used was different, the volume aerosolized and the concentration reached in the chamber for each agent was also different (Table 2). In our experimental setup it was necessary to fit the germicidal nebulization time within the phage\u2019s nebulization times. The nebulization time was set to 10 min in order to reach the same phage concentration in the chamber for all the assays. Because the infectivity of phages PR772 and \u03d5X174 is strongly affected by their time spent airborne, it was essential to standardize nebulization times, germicidal exposure, and sampling times. Therefore, it was not possible to extend the aerosolization time to increase the concentration of the germicidal agent in the chamber. Despite lower concentrations of germicides in the chamber compared to MiST\u00ae and H2O2, Pledge\u00ae and Eugenol led to the highest reduction (up to 3 logs) of airborne viruses.",
