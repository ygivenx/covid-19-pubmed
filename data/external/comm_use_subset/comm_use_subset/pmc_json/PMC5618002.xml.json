HSV establishes latent infection in neuronal cell bodies, and becomes reactivated when triggered by environmental or physiological factors [1,2]. The replication of herpes virus is temporally regulated by immediate early (IE), early and late genes. Although the clinical manifestations by viral infection are generally benign and self-limiting, severe or even life-threatening cases such as herpes encephalitis (HSE) are observed occasionally. There are no effective drugs that can completely eradicate the virus [3]; therefore, studies on the interaction between the virus and its host are necessary, and may shed light on antiviral strategy.",

            "text": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membranous network of branching tubules and flattened sacs, running through the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells, and continues with the nuclear envelope. Approximately one-third of the total cellular proteins are translocated into the lumen of the ER for post-translational modification and correct folding [4]. Misfolded or unfolded proteins are transported out of the ER and degraded through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). When a large amount of newly synthesized proteins are transported into ER and are beyond the folding capability of ER, ER stress occurs. ER stress is an evolutionarily conserved cellular stress condition, which plays important roles in diverse biological processes, including metabolism, tumorigenesis and viral infection [5,6,7,8]. ER stress response can transmit stress signal from ER to nucleus by triggering signal transductions known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR consists of three independent ER membrane transducers, including protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Triggering of these transducers could lead to the modulation of protein translation, protein folding, and degradation to either reestablish the homeostasis or activate apoptosis when the stress persists [9,10]. Virus infections could induce UPR by accumulating unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen when a burst of viral protein synthesis occurs. On the other hand, UPR was shown to influence the replication of a number of viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV) [11], Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [12] and HSV-1 [13], etc.",

            "text": "The IRE1\u03b1/XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) branch is the most conserved signaling pathway in UPR from yeast to humans. IRE1 has two isoforms in mammalian cells: IRE1\u03b1 and IRE1\u03b2. IRE1\u03b1 is expressed in most tissues and cells, while the expression of IRE1\u03b2 is primarily restricted to intestinal epithelial cells [14]. IRE1\u03b1 possesses both kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activity at its C-terminal cytosolic moiety [15], and its N-terminal luminal domain acts as a sensor of unfolded or misfolded proteins under stress conditions [16]. BiP (binding immunoglobulin protein), also known as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), constitutively binds to IRE1\u03b1 to prevent its activation under nonstress conditions. In response to ER stress, BiP binds to the unfolded proteins and releases from IRE1\u03b1, leading to IRE1\u03b1 activation [17]. XBP1 mRNA is the first discovered substrate for the IRE1\u03b1 RNase. The activation of IRE1\u03b1 results in its dimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to the cleavage of XBP1 mRNA via an unconventional splicing reaction [18]. Expression of the spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) acts as a transcription factor for the expression of genes which are critical for efficient protein folding, maturation, and degradation [19]. Besides of XBP1 pre-mRNA, RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 also mediates the degradation of a select subset of cellular mRNAs, that is termed regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) [20]. RIDD cleaved pre-mRNAs at a site different from the XBP1 spliced site, and either maintains ER homeostasis or induces apoptosis [21]. If the ER stress is not mitigated, the activated IRE1\u03b1 can also lead to the activation of JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) by recruiting and clustering the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and then triggers apoptosis [22].

            "text": "IRE1\u03b1 was reported to be involved in many viral infections. Hassan et al. reported that influenza A viral replication activated the IRE1 branch of UPR [23]. The IRE1\u03b1 pathway is also activated during a murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection [24]. Another study observed that hepatitis C virus suppressed the IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 pathway during infection [25]. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpes virus, which can also inhibit the XBP1 target gene EDEM (ER degradation enhancing \u03b1-mannosidase-like protein) to benefit viral replication [26]. The investigation of cellular UPR during HSV-1 replication has been mainly focused on the PERK signaling pathway [13,27,28]. Although studies have shown that RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 was inactivated during HSV-1 infection [29,30], it remains unknown about the effect of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity on viral replication. Stress-induced JNKs activation was reported to be important for the efficiency of HSV-1 viral replication since JNK inhibitors could reduce the viral yield by 70% [31,32]. Since activated IRE1\u03b1 can lead to JNKs activation [22], the relationship between JNKs and IRE1\u03b1 during viral infection deserves further investigation. In the current study, we found that the IRE1\u03b1 expression was up-regulated during HSV-1 infection, which suggests that the IRE1\u03b1 branch may be involved in the regulation of HSV-1 replication. Further study showed that when IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity was increased by either pretreating cells with chemical compounds or XBP1s over-expression, the HSV-1 replication was repressed, suggesting that the RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 is unfavorable for the virus. We presented evidence that the JNK is activated by IRE1\u03b1 kinase activity, and thus facilitates viral replication. In conclusion, our research indicates that HSV-1 replication is regulated by both the RNase and the kinase activities of IRE1\u03b1, and these two activities have distinct effects on viral replication.",

Previous study showed that HCV suppressed the IRE1-XBP1 pathway to facilitate its replication [25]. Recent research found that the IRE1-XBP1 pathway was also inhibited by HSV-1 UL41 protein [30], but the effect of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity on HSV-1 remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated the effect of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity on HSV-1 replication. STF-083010, an inhibitor of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity [45] that suppressed the Tg-induced XBP1 splicing in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2D), was used as a means for demonstrating the effect of reducing RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 on HSV-1 infection. Tg and STF-083010, which have opposite effects on XBP1 splicing, were used to treat cells before viral infection, and their effects on the viral infection were evaluated by measuring the PFU 24 h p.i. Tg but not STF-083010 inhibited the replication of HSV-1, as shown in Figure 2E,F. The inhibitory effect of Tg on viral replication was supported by gD reduction in the presence of the drug, as shown in Figure 2G. Consistently, STF-083010 showed no effect on gD expression (Figure 2H). Since the cell viability was not affected by the drug at the experimental concentrations as determined by CCK-8 colorimetric assay, we ruled out the possibility that the viral inhibitory activity was due to the cytotoxic effect of the drug (the data was shown in the supplementary material).",

We also employed an HSV-1/blue recombinant virus assay to confirm the effect of spliced XBP1 on viral replication. This recombinant virus contains an HSV-1 ICP4 promoter-driven lacZ gene, inserted into the HSV-1 TK gene loci. We determined the effect of XBP1s overexpression on viral replication by measuring the regulated expression of \u03b2-galactosidase of the recombinant virus as a marker for viral growth [46,47]. The result showed that the replication of HSV-1/blue was reduced, indicating that ICP4 promoter activity was inhibited in the Hela cells overexpressing XBP1s (lower panel of Figure 2I). During the ER stress responses, terminally unfolded or misfolded proteins may be degraded by ERAD. We speculated that the viral proteins would be degraded by ERAD when a large amount of viral proteins accumulated in ER during replication. HSV-1 may have evolved countermeasures to IRE1-XBP1 action to prevent detrimental effect induced by XBP1 splicing, and this speculation was supported by a previous study which showed that XBP1 splicing induced by Tg was repressed by HSV-1 UL41 protein [30]. To explore if the downstream of XBP1 was also inhibited by HSV-1 infection, we measured the transcriptions of both EDEM and Herp genes, both of which are regulated by XBP1s and directly participate in ERAD [43,48]. HEC-1-A cells were cultured in the presence of Tg (1 \u03bcM) for 30 min and then infected with HSV-1 (moi = 1) for 12 h and the transcriptions of both EDEM and Herp were determined by real-time PCR. The results showed that increased transcriptions of these two genes induced by Tg were downregulated by HSV-1 infection (Figure 2J), suggesting that HSV-1 suppressed ERAD by inhibiting the RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 to avoid degradation of the viral proteins. STF-083010 (60 \u03bcM), used as control, significantly suppressed Tg-induced XBP1 splicing (2D), and the transcription of both EDEM and Herp (2J). Taken together, the results suggest that RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 is detrimental to the viral replication, and were not activated during viral infection.",

To exclude the impact of RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 on viral replication, we used STF-083010 to inhibit the APY29-induced RNase activity since XBP1 splicing induced by APY29 was inhibited by STF-083010 (Figure 3B). HSV-1 replication was inhibited by APY29 in a dose dependent manner, as shown by In-cell Western analysis on gD-1 expression (Figure 3C). When cells were pretreated with both APY29 and STF-083010 and then infected with HSV-1, APY29 showed an inhibitory effect on viral replication independent of the presence of STF-083010 (Figure 3D), suggests that the suppression of kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1 by APY29 is sufficient to inhibit viral replication. This conclusion was supported by the result that down-regulation of phosphorylated IRE1\u03b1, induced by APY29 compared with that of the control group, gD expression was suppressed, as shown in Figure 3E. To further determine the role of kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1 on viral replication, Hela cells were transfected with a kinase-inactive mutant K599A human IRE1\u03b1 (IRE1KA) [53], and its effect on HSV-1 replication was analyzed by Western blot analysis. The result showed that gD expression was completely inhibited by IRE1KA, but not the wild-type of IRE1\u03b1 (Figure 3F), suggesting that the kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1 is required for the viral replication.

In a previous study, IRE1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts were reported to be impaired in JNK activation during ER stress induced by Tg [22]. We, therefore, analyzed the effect of IRE1\u03b1 down-regulation by RNA interference (RNAi) on JNK activation during viral infection. The results showed that compared with siNC, siIRE1\u03b1 significantly down-regulated IRE1\u03b1 and reduced gD expression (Figure 4C,D). Consistent with the observations, the JNK activation (p-JNK) induced by HSV-1 infection was also reduced by IRE1\u03b1 knockdown, as shown in Figure 4E, suggesting that IRE1\u03b1 pathway is one of the mechanisms mediating the JNK activation during HSV-1 infection. To further explore the mechanism of IRE1\u03b1-mediated JNK activation, we examined the effect of wild-type IRE1\u03b1 and IRE1KA on JNK activation and showed that both viral replication, and JNK phosphorylation were suppressed in IRE1KA (Figure 4F). We further examined the effect of the combination of APY29 and STF-083010 on JNK signaling activation and showed that the treatment of cells with these two drugs significantly inhibited the virus-induced JNK activation, and the viral replication (Figure 4G). Taken together, the evidences suggest that the kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1 is involved in the regulation of HSV-1 replication through JNK signaling pathway. We, therefore, postulate that HSV-1 replication is facilitated by the kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1 while inhibited by the RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1.",

Regulators of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity, Tg, and STF-083010, were reported to modulate RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 in both RIDD and XBP1 splicing processes, both of these two processes are activated by Tg and inhibited by STF-083010 [7,55]. Although RIDD was induced during ER stress, the target genes modulated by RIDD are quite complicated, and those published substrates of RIDD still lack fully validation [56], so most studies select XBP1 splicing to represent the RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1. In order to facilitate viral replication, IRE1-XBP1 pathway that mediates IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity was suppressed in infection by the Hepatitis C virus, human cytomegalovirus, and Rotavirus while activated in infections of Influenza A virus, Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, Hepatitis B virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Flavivirus, and Epstein-Barr virus [7,23,24,25,26,57,58,59,60], indicating that the roles of IRE1\u03b1-XBP1 on viral replication depend on viruses.

We speculate that IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity activates cellular protein degradation pathway (ERAD), and leads to the degradation of viral proteins, which is unfavourable to viral replication. This assumption was supported by our data that Tg-induced IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity resulted in the inhibition of HSV-1 replication (Figure 2E,G). Results from an earlier study showed that PERK branch of UPR were activated by Tg through up-regulating phosphorylation of PERK [13]. PERK signaling regulates the suppression of translation initiation through phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 to shutoff the cellular protein translation, and this response is used as an inhibitory mechanism on viral replication by the host. To facilitate viral replication, HSV-1 has evolved a countermeasure to avoid the detrimental effect of PERK through dephosphorylation of the eIF2\u03b1, mediated by a virus encoded protein \u03b31 34.5 [61,62]. The ATF6 arm of UPR was also activated by Tg [29]. Researchers suggested that the activation of ATF6 and its transcriptional activation of chaperone-encoding genes might benefit the virus by assisting the folding of accumulated proteins and preventing protein aggregation. This idea was supported by observations showing that ATF6 signaling was stimulated by virus infections, such as HCV and African swine fever virus (ASFV), and beneficial to viral replication [11,63]. Therefore, we speculate that the Tg induced inhibition of viral replication was specifically mediated by its regulation of IRE1\u03b1 branch, which was further supported by the observation that XBP1s over-expression also led to the viral inhibition (Figure 2I). The limited inhibitory effect of Tg-induced RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 (about 50% inhibition of HSV-1 replication (Figure 2E,G)) may reflect a viral countermeasure to suppress RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1, as an earlier report showed that IRE1-XBP1 signal was inhibited by HSV-1 UL41 protein [30]. We also observed that the transcriptions of XBP1s target genes were up-regulated by Tg, but this up-regulation was suppressed in HSV-1 infected cells (Figure 2J); however, detailed mechanisms of this feedback regulation need further investigation. In agreement with earlier studies that IRE1-XBP1 arm of UPR was inactivated or suppressed by HSV-1 infection [27,29,30], we further presented evidence that the activation of the RNase activity of IRE1\u03b1 is detrimental to HSV-1 replication, and suppression of the RNase activity may serve as a mechanism for the virus to escape from host restriction.

            "text": "JNK pathway is activated under cellular stresses [64]. The protein kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase, kinase (MKK) 4 and MKK7 activate the JNK in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines or cellular stresses [65]. IRE1 signaling also modulates the JNK activation when UPR occurred [22]. Both JNK and p38 MAPK are activated by HSV infection [66]. However, evidence on how proximal signals are coupled to the activation of JNK kinase during HSV-1 infection is limited. Our data showed that HSV-1-stimulated JNK activation was repressed when IRE1\u03b1 expression was down-modulated by RNA interference, indicating that IRE1\u03b1 was one of the upstream regulators of the JNK cascade during HSV-1 infection (Figure 4E). We showed that IRE1\u03b1 kinase activity positively regulated the HSV-1 replication (Figure 3), while IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity negatively regulated viral replication (Figure 2E\u2013I), suggesting that HSV-1-induced JNK cascade activation was mediated by IRE1\u03b1 kinase activity. We further confirmed this result by over-expressing IRE1KA, or using the kinase inhibitor, both of which resulted in the reduced activation of JNK and viral replication. These data strongly suggest that IRE1\u03b1 kinase activity is required for HSV-1 replication due to its stimulation of JNK kinase cascade in infected cells. Previous studies showed that HSV-1 viral proteins, such as ICP0, ICP27, or VP16, were correlated with JNK activation [32,66,67]. Since co-localizations of ICP0 or gD with IRE1\u03b1 were observed in our preliminary study (data not shown), we speculate that the viral protein(s) might participate in the regulation of the IRE1\u03b1 kinase activity to facilitate HSV-1 replication. Further investigation still need be done to unveil the detailed mechanisms.",

But IRE1\u03b1 kinase activity was helpful to HSV-1 replication. To counter the cellular restriction, HSV-1 inactivates the RNase activity, while activating the kinase activity of IRE1\u03b1 through a yet unknown mechanism. This differential role of IRE1\u03b1 activation on HSV-1 replication allows the virus to avoid detrimental consequence of UPR while exploiting the activation of JNK signaling pathway to facilitate its replication. It warrants further investigations to delineate the molecular mechanisms that dictate the elevation of kinase activities and the related viral factors.",
