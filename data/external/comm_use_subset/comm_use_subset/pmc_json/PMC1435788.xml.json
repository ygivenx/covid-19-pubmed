By March 2003, the illness designated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Toronto, Canada [\n2]. The global SARS outbreak ended that July, but during its existence the disease caused 774 fatalities and had a significant economic impact on Southeast Asia [\n3\u2013\n5]. A special concern was its predilection for nosocomial spread, as 21% of SARS cases occurred in healthcare workers . In certain local outbreaks, hospital staff accounted for over 50% of cases, and nosocomial spread to other patients or family members accounted for a significant proportion of SARS cases [\n6].\n",

            "text": "Developing adequate animal models for SARS is a high research priority. Coronaviruses tend to have a limited range of host species, but several animal species have been found to support SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication [\n7]. BALB/c mice were shown to support high levels of viral replication in the respiratory tract after intranasal challenge, and this model has been used to test SARS vaccines [\n8\u2013\n10]. Infection of an additional rodent model (the strain 129SvEv mouse) showed infection of the respiratory epithelium after intranasal SARS-CoV challenge [\n11]. Domestic cats and ferrets support viral replication after intratracheal challenge, and ferret models have been used to study active and passive immunization against SARS [\n12\u2013\n14]. Research has focused on several animal species as potential natural reservoirs for SARS-CoV. Himalayan palm civets\n(Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs\n(Nyctereutes procyonoides) were found to be susceptible to infection with a virus closely related to human SARS-CoV [\n15]. Experimental infection of civets produced clinical illness and histopathological evidence of pneumonia [\n16]. Chickens and pigs challenged with SARS-CoV had viral RNA in blood during the first week postinfection, but neither species appeared to support significant viral replication or manifested clinical illness [\n17]. Recently, Li et al. [\n18] reported that several species of wild bats in China are carriers of a coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV. No studies have evaluated animal model infection or pathogenesis of recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV) derived from a molecular clone [\n19].\n",

All studies detected SARS-CoV replication in one or several monkey species and documented seroconversion, thereby confirming established infection. Aside from observable clinical symptoms, these studies relied on virus shedding and histopathology specimens from necropsy as objective markers of disease. Most studies euthanized animals during the course of infection to document histopathological disease. Only two studies followed animals for more than 14 d after infection [\n20,\n22].

Disease progression can be somewhat slow, with onset of severe respiratory disease occurring anywhere from 1 to 2 wk after initial symptoms [\n27]. Pulmonary radiographic abnormalities are almost universally reported in SARS cases [\n28]. However, early radiographs may be normal, and there is clear evidence of infection without radiographic abnormality in a small number of cases [\n29,\n30]. Multifocal disease is present in 30\u201350% of initial radiographs, and the majority of persons progress to multifocal disease that peaks between 8 and 14 d after symptom onset [\n28,\n31\u2013\n34].

Purified RNA was analyzed on the Ruggedized Advanced Pathogen Identification Device (RAPID, Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States) as follows: 5 \u03bcl of RNA from each sample was added to the appropriate SARS-specific assay master mix (15 \u03bcl) and cycled in the LightCycler as described in\nProtocol S1. All test runs included at least one positive control that contained 0.075 pfu equivalents of plaque-purified SARS-CoV RNA and two no-template controls: reagent and sample.

One African green monkey was also noted to have a single febrile temperature on PID day 3 [\n20]. Rowe et al. [\n25] examined SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and reported only minimal symptomatic disease. In the Rowe et al. study, as in ours, symptomatic infection was detected only in animals challenged mucosally and not in animals infected IV [\n25].\n",

We observed unifocal or multifocal radiographic disease resolving quickly instead of progressing to severe diffuse disease, which is consistent with findings in children with SARS [\n37,\n39,\n42,\n43]. Absence of fever may not be as significant as it would seem. In published reports, children with SARS did present with fever, but the data are biased, because fever was universally included in case definitions [\n36\u2013\n39,\n41]. Fever in children less than ten years old who are diagnosed with SARS tends to be relatively mild and short in duration [\n36\u2013\n39,\n41]. In these reports, it is possible that children with mild clinical illness from SARS who did not develop a significant fever may have remained undiagnosed. This premise is supported by at least one documented case of SARS in an adult without fever [\n49]. Hematologic findings, particularly lymphopenia, are more prevalent in children with SARS [\n36\u2013\n39,\n41] than in the macaques of our study, but Rowe et al.

Adults and children appear to have similar levels of SARS-CoV viremia associated with infection, implying that levels of viral replication are similar in both groups [\n50]. Adults with SARS have significantly increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [\n51\u2013\n53]. Activation of inflammatory cytokines in children with SARS may be less dramatic [\n54], and preliminary data suggest that this is the case in NHPs as well [\n25]. Thus, immune response may account for variations in SARS severity between age groups and even species.\n",

As in prior studies, we found overt clinical disease in animals infected by mucosal routes that was much less severe than adult human SARS. We found radiographic pulmonary disease in most of these animals that resembled radiographic findings in human SARS. Overall, the disease we observed had some similarities to SARS in young children. Further study is needed to determine the applicability of NHP models to the study of SARS.",
