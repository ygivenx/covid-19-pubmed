In most viral species, each viral particle contains all the genetic material needed to carry out replication inside a host cell, and generate a progeny of viral particles. A prominent exception to this behavior is found in multipartite viruses. These viruses, first described in the 1960s [1], have a genome segmented in two or more parts. According to current evidence, the segments are encapsidated separately and, apparently, propagate independently [2, 3]. As of today, there is no mainstream theory able to explain the adaptive advantage of such a strange lifestyle [4]. The main puzzle regarding multipartite viruses is how the simultaneous presence of multiple segments, which imposes severe constraints on the number of viral particles that have to reach a susceptible host, is balanced by other adaptive advantages of multipartitism, whether microscopic or ecological [5, 6].",

            "text": "Despite this apparent paradox, multipartitism is widespread in the Virosphere, as up to 40% of all known viral families are multipartite [7]. A large majority of them infects either plants or fungi, with only four known examples of species infecting exclusively animals [5]. Evolutionary pathways leading to multipartitism are likely to be multiple, since this strategy is present in RNA and DNA viruses, and in the latter case an origin to a single ancestral virus cannot be traced. Beyond its virological interest, multipartitism has a particularly negative effect on agricultural production, as several multipartite viruses are pathogenic, and routinely cripple crop yield [8]. Cultivars themselves may have directly played a role in the rise of multipartitism, as an evolutionary radiation in the diversity of viral species, many being just centuries old, was likely promoted by an intensification of agricultural practices [9\u201311]. It has been put forward that multipartite species might be at an advantage in the face of environmental changes, since they likely adapt faster due to new combinations of segments promoted by their genomic architecture [5]. It is known that changes in land cover offer multiple opportunities for novel interactions between plants and pathogens [12\u201315]. Studies on the impact of agriculture in viral ecology have uncovered a surprisingly negative association between plant diversity and family-level diversity of plant-associated viruses, and a higher prevalence of viruses in cultivated areas [16].",

Specifically, it has been shown in vitro that two defective forms spontaneously generated by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV has an unsegmented genome formed by ssRNA of positive polarity) can complement each other and quickly substitute the wt form [20]. This strategy has been formally explored in models of competitive dynamics between the wt and a number of complementing segments [21], which implemented different advantages that could compensate for the cost of an increased MOI. The model mimicked the experimental setting where, in particular, host-cell availability corresponded to that of a well-mixed system. Two of the advantages implemented had been theoretically proposed in the past, though, as of yet, have not received empirical support (a faster replicative ability [22] and a slower accumulation of deleterious mutations in shorter segments [23, 24]) while, in the case of FMDV, it was shown that capsids containing shorter genomes enjoyed a larger average lifetime between infection events [25]. This differential degradation, dependent on genome length, was sufficient to compensate for co-infection requirements in multipartite forms with two, to up to four, segments [21], but cannot explain the emergence of multipartite viruses with many segments, such as nanoviruses or babuviruses [5]. Hence, the evolutionary pathway explored in that work would be applicable to a subset of all currently described multipartite viral species.",

            "text": "As the generation of functional defective mutants from the wt occurs at a much longer time scale than the spread of the virus in the population, we set up a model that already contains both the wt and a cohort of defective forms, potentially complementary. This allows us to study the competition dynamics between the different forms causing them to coexist in, or take over the ecological niche. Using both analytical calculations and numerical tools, we investigate the outcome of a random emergence of mutants, and derive the conditions that make multipartitism a fitness-enhancing strategy, allowing the virus to adapt to a wider range of hosts and environments. Since no apparent structural feature discriminates multipartite viruses from monopartite ones\u2014they are found exhibiting different capsid structures, genome sizes and types [26]\u2014we include in the model as few virological features as possible, and investigate how multipartitism impacts on the spreading potential of the virus. We do, however, account for key viral mechanisms that can drive the resilience of multipartitism in an ecological context. The first one is the already mentioned differential degradation, i.e., the different average lifetime of defective viral particles with respect to wt\u2019s, or formally equivalent advantages of faster replication or elimination of deleterious mutations through sex. A second biological mechanism is the mode of transmission of multipartite viruses between hosts. Most known multipartite viruses are spread by vectors (mainly insects), which typically pick up very few viral particles from an infected plant [27]. The transmission process between hosts typically acts as a population bottleneck for the virus, entailing a loss of genetic diversity and, if severe enough, the systematic purge of deleterious forms [28, 29]. Thanks to our parsimonious modeling setup, any of the aforementioned mechanisms can be seen as effectively impacting the chances of the wt or defective particles to reach the target hosts, leading to a difference in transmissibility. A single model parameter, therefore, by tuning this relative transmissibility, embraces a number of different biological processes. In this sense, the results of our model can be extended to other systems as long as the specific mechanisms involved in their spreading fitness can be cast in the form of changes in transmissibility. Remarkably, we find out that even in the absence of an explicit microscopic advantage, ecological dynamics might cause the fixation of the multipartite form due to the stochastic extinction (analogous to random drift) of the monopartite virus.",

Its topology may be diverse, depending on plant distribution and vector behavior, with two limit cases being the distribution of plant species in the wild (see, e.g. [30] and references therein) and huge modern agriculturally homogeneous regions [31]. These different architectures are implemented by tuning the distribution of contact rates among hosts, with limiting cases being fixed contact rate, and power law-distributed contact rate.

As previously done [21], we take advantage of the timescale separation between the random emergence of defective mutants due to errors during replication of the complete genome, and the competition between forms driven by their spread in the host population.

There are four possible endemic states, depending of which variants circulate. We equivalently use the term equilibria, as they are the stable equilibrium points of the spreading dynamics. The first one is wt, in which only the wt is prevalent, and the defective variants have died out. This case maps into an effective SIS model for the compartment \u231cwt\u231f. In the second one, hj, any defective segment can circulate alongside the wt because, roughly speaking, the transmissibility of the latter is so high that any defective variant can hijack it, with no need to complement the genome with other variants. In this case, we will likely see the circulation of a number of variants lower than v, as segments can go extinct without hampering the circulation of the remaining ones. The third endemic state, seg, witnesses the presence of all the v segmented variants without wt, and in this case complementation is essential. This state is an SIS model for the compartment \u231cseg\u231f. Finally, the state all exhibits circulation of the wt plus all the variants v. Borrowing some terminology from physics, we can then define different epidemic phases. Phases are regions of the space of model parameters. Inside each phase, the macroscopic behavior of viral spread is qualitatively the same. Specifically, we can define a phase in terms of which endemic states it allows. The parameter surfaces separating different phases are called phase transitions, the most important in epidemiology being the epidemic threshold. Below the epidemic threshold, only the dfs exists. Above it, the pathogen can circulate. There, we identify five other phases: wt-phase allows only wt; contingent-phase allows wt, hj and all; mix-phase allows wt, seg and all; seg-phase allows only seg; finally all-phase admits all the possible endemic states.",

            "text": "Firstly, however, we need to set up the theoretical modeling framework in terms of reaction-diffusion equations. For a generic v, we order the compartments by increasing number of viral species they contain, starting from \u231cwt\u231f, and ending with \u231cseg\u231f, \u231call\u231f. For instance, for v = 3, this would be \u231cwt\u231f, \u231c1\u231f, \u231c2\u231f, \u231c3\u231f, \u231c12\u231f, \u231c13\u231f, \u231c23\u231f, \u231cseg\u231f, \u231call\u231f. Within the framework of heterogeneous mean field [41\u201343], we divide hosts in classes according to their contact potential (degree in the language of networks), so that if two hosts have degree k, h, respectively, their contact rate will be the product kh (in the absence of degree-degree correlations). We assume hosts with the same degree are equivalent, and consider the prevalence per degree class. To this end, we define the variable x\u03bdk as the prevalence of compartment with index \u03bd and degree class k, i.e., the fraction of the host population which has that degree, and finds itself in that compartment. In terms of x\u03bdk, the equations describing the evolution of the disease are\nx\u02d9\u03bdk=\u2212\u03bcx\u03bdk+k\u2329k\u232a\u2211\u03b2[\u0393\u03bd\u03b2(1\u2212\u2211\u03c3x\u03c3k)+\u2211\u03c3\u039b\u03bd\u03b2\u03c3x\u03c3k](\u2211hhp\u03b3(h)x\u03b2h),(1)\nwhere p\u03b3(k) is the probability of a host having degree equal to k. We consider the homogeneous case, where all hosts have the same degree, so that p\u03b3(k) = \u03b4k,1 (with no loss of generality we set it to 1), and a highly heterogeneous case, where p\u03b3(k) = C\u03b3\nk\u2212\u03b3 is a power-law with exponent \u03b3, and normalization constant C\u03b3. We denote \u2329km\u232a as the m-th moment of the degree distribution, computed as \u2329km\u232a = \u2211k\np\u03b3(k)km, as usual. The term \u2329k\u232a appearing in Eq 1 is then the expected degree. The Greek indices \u03b2, \u03bd, \u03c3, run on all the infectious compartments defined before. The susceptible compartment is not included, as the number of susceptible hosts is completely determined by the other compartments, thanks to the assumption of constant population size. \u0393\u03bd\u03b2 is the rate of the transition \u231c\u03b2\u231f\u231cS\u231f \u2192 \u03b2\u231c\u03bd\u231f, i.e., a transition affecting the prevalence of compartment \u231c\u03bd\u231f through a contact between a host in compartment \u231c\u03b2\u231f and a Susceptible. \u039b\u03bd\u03b2\u03c3 encodes transmission rates among infected individuals, and specifically a transmission from \u231c\u03b2\u231f to\u231c\u03c3\u231f, that leads to the change of the prevalence of \u231c\u03bd\u231f. The entries of \u0393\u03bd\u03b2, \u039b\u03bd\u03b2\u03c3 are functions of \u03bb, \u03c1 and v. Eq (1) thus links the change in the number of hosts with a given degree, and in a compartment (x\u02d9\u03bdk), to one reaction and two diffusion processes. The first term, \u03bcx\u03bdk, represents the decrease due to hosts recovering back to the susceptible state. The second one, with coupling constant \u0393, contains the probability of a host, with degree k, being susceptible (1-\u2211\u03c3x\u03c3k), and being infected by a host in compartment \u03b2, and degree h. The last term, with coupling constant \u039b, has the same structure, but the target compartment is a generic infectious compartment \u03c3, instead of the susceptible one. Both infection terms contain the term khp\u03b3(h)/\u2329k\u232a, which is the probability a host of degree k establishes a contact with a host of degree h, given a network with no degree-degree correlations [44].",

This entails an important scaling: recovery rate and topology never impact the critical points on their own, but always jointly as \u03bc^. This fact was well-known in the case of the epidemic threshold, Eq (2) [41]. Here, we rigorously prove that it extends also to all other critical points. Given that homogeneous contact networks have \u2329k\u232a \u223c \u2329k2\u232a, the heterogeneous (power-law-like) network recovers the homogeneous case when \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e.

These hosts can reach a significant part of the population, and when infectious, they act as superspreades. They are responsible for causing \u03bc^ to go to zero (\u03bc^\u21920) in the limit of large population size (N \u2192 \u221e), when the exponent of the degree distribution respects 2 < \u03b3 < 3.

Finally, for very high differential transmissibility \u03c1>\u03bc^-1, the wt no longer spreads and the only possible phase is the seg-phase (see Fig 2B and 2C).",

A closed-form solution of this system does not exist for heterogeneous networks. In the homogeneous case, while a complete analytical derivation of the endemic states is not possible, we can obtain two important results. Firstly, we notice that the total prevalence of the wt, i.e., the fraction of hosts infected by it (z = \u2211\u03bd \u2260 \u231cseg\u231f\nx\u03bd), obeys an SIS dynamics (see S1 Text) with transmissibility \u03bb, and can thus be computed as zwt = 1 \u2212 \u03bc/\u03bb. Secondly, when the whole set of segments circulates without wt (as compartment \u231cseg\u231f), again the virus spreads as an SIS, this time with transmissibility (\u03c1\u03bb)v, and its endemic value can be predicted in the same fashion: zseg=1-\u03c1(\u03c1\u03bb)v. Interestingly, for high \u03c1, and a transmissibility \u03bb > \u03c1\u2212v/(v \u2212 1), it turns out that zseg > zwt: the prevalence of the multipartite form is higher than that of the wt.",

We can also determine the nature of such emergence, in terms of a commensal relationship with the wt, or a true competitive advantage at the ecological level. For the sake of simplicity, we start by considering no differential transmissibility (\u03c1 = 1): wt and segments have the same transmission probability. The relevant figures are Fig 2A and 2B, points P1, P2 and P3 in Figs 2E and 3. In this scenario, three phases are possible, and one crosses them all by increasing the transmissibility \u03bb. The first one (\u03bb just above T1) is the wt-phase, in which only the wt can circulate, and whenever a defective segment is produced, it quickly goes extinct. By increasing \u03bb, we then encounter the contingent-phase. This phase predates the appearance of true multipartitism, as defective segments can hijack the wt to circulate. These segments cannot persist on their own, but the highly prevalent wt allows them to complete the replication cycle. At this stage, any defective segment is a commensal of wt, as the persistence of the former depends on the latter, while wt\u2019s fitness remains unchanged. The emergence of multipartitism in this context is a contingent process: segments circulate simply because they are allowed to, causing no change to the overall fitness of the virus. Furthermore, there is no selective pressure towards complementation, as a combination of segments reconstructing the full genome without the presence of the wt (compartment \u231cseg\u231f) would not be able to persist. This is confirmed by the functional form of T2 in Eq (4), which features no dependence on the number of complementing variants v: the survival of each mutant is independent of the presence of others, as effective replication and diffusion is wt-mediated. In other words, complementation would not make the variants fitter to the environment.",

Here, in addition to the commensal relationship between wt and segments, complementing variants are able to circulate on their own, without wt: the equilibrium seg emerges. Selection then imposes a bias on those segments that together reconstruct the genome, as they represent a new effective spreading configuration, and increase the overall viral fitness. They are thus advantaged with respect to purely commensal segments. This fitness-enhancing effect is quite straightforward: let us suppose that, due to viral or host population bottlenecks, or another stochastic event, wt prevalence goes down drastically, to the point where it is cleared from the system. In the contingent-phase this would lead to complete viral extinction, as all the segments would die out, too, as their persistence is linked to wt\u2019s. In the all-phase, on the other hand, the virus is more resilient, as it can still circulate thanks to complementation. This time selective pressure toward complementation is well visible in the expression of Ts in Eq (4), which depends exponentially on the number of variants v. This fact is in qualitative agreement with results in [21], where it was shown that the larger the number of segments, the harder to reach the persistence of the segmented variants within a host. Even if the multipartite genome does not enjoy any microscopic advantage, it can rise to fixation if the monopartite virus undergoes stochastic extinction. Though fluctuations would also affect the multipartite form, and stochastic extinction of the monopartite form is not very likely, similar scenarios are relevant in virus evolution [45, 46] and cannot be discarded a priori.",

As we have explained, in the phase space, topology is encoded in the parameter \u03bc^. A low epidemic threshold is a well known feature of heterogeneous networks [41, 42, 44]. Specifically, power-law networks with \u03b3 < 3 exhibit a vanishing threshold as they grow larger, as the emergence of highly connected hubs ensures the persistence of the disease at any value of transmissibility, that is \u2329k\u232a/\u2329k2\u232a \u2192 0 (and as a result, \u03bc^\u21920) as the number of potential hosts grows, N \u2192 \u221e. In our case this translates into T1, which is the epidemic threshold, going to zero for \u03bc^\u21920. Also T2, Ts \u2192 0. Further information is obtained when comparing their limit behaviors. As \u03bc^ becomes smaller, T2/T1 increases but remains finite, while Ts/T1 \u2192 \u221e. This implies that, the higher the heterogeneity of the network is, the more difficult it becomes for multipartitism to persist. Specifically, reaching the all-phase from the wt-phase would require an infinite relative increase (in the limit \u03bc^\u21920) in transmissibility. Even when heterogeneity is not severe enough so as to cause the threshold to vanish, i.e., when \u03b3 > 3, heterogeneity makes it harder to sustain multipartitism, as both T2/T1 and Ts/T1 are decreasing functions of \u03bc^.",

            "text": "Summarizing, homogeneous contact patterns favor the emergence and persistence of multipartitism, while heterogeneous contacts hamper it. Qualitatively, this is the result of the complex interaction between the bottlenecks induced by between-host transmission and the presence of superspreaders, i.e., hosts that can potentially infect a large fraction of the population thanks to their high number of contacts. Combining this mechanism with a low MOI\u2014and hence low \u03bb\u2014predicts an evolutionary radiation of multipartite viral forms linked to the rise and intensification of agricultural practices. In crops and cultivars, contacts among hosts are much more homogeneous (and often closer) than in wild settings, tremendously alleviating the requirements imposed by co-infection. Multipartite viruses adapted to the patchy distribution of wild hosts could have found it easy to propagate in regular, monospecific host populations which in all cases have closely related wild forms from which they departed through artificial selection [47].",

            "text": "Up to this point, we have assumed that all viral forms have the same transmissibility and, still, fixation of the multipartite form cannot be fully discarded. Any additional advantage, however minor, of multipartitism will contribute to its ecological success, as we now discuss. We now set out to study the impact of enhanced transmissibility of defective variants, encoded in the parameter \u03c1 being larger than one (\u03c1 > 1). As \u03c1 increases, the endemic state seg becomes more prevalent and more likely with respect to wt (see Fig 3C and 3D). Specifically, the value of the transmissibility for which zseg > zwt decreases as \u03c1 increases, facilitating the predominance of the multipartite form (in Fig 3A point P3 has zwt < zseg, while P4 and P5 have zseg > zwt). Most importantly, \u03c1 > 1 causes two new phases to emerge (Fig 3B, 3C and 3D), and both facilitate the rise of multipartitism by eliminating hj from their possible equilibria. One is the mix-phase, in which the virus circulates either as wt or as a multipartite. The mix-phase also presents an all endemic state that results from the interaction between the two former equilibria. Unlike in the all-phase, however, here the all equilibrium no longer indicates commensal relation. The second emerging phase is the seg-phase, in which only the complemented multipartite virus is able to circulate, while the monopartite version quickly goes extinct (yellow, and point P6 in Figs 2 and 3). This phase is of paramount importance because it lies in a parameter region where, without developing multipartitism, the virus would not be endemic. In addition, by prescribing the exclusive presence of the multipartite form, it allows to explain the phenomenology observed in nature, as the simultaneous presence of monopartite and defective-complementing forms of the same virus has been observed only in vitro [20, 48\u201350]. In vivo, viral species circulate as either pure monopartite (endemic state wt), or pure multipartite (seg). Furthermore, although in vitro several defective viral forms are generated and detected, and propagate along the wt (which would correspond to an in vitro\nhj), this equilibrium is rarely found in wild plants. There is, however, an association between fully-fledged viruses and defective viral forms formally equivalent to the hj equilibrium: virus and viral satellites [51]. Often, in addition, satellites modify the aetiology of viral infections [52], such that the transmissibility and the recovery rate might be affected by its presence in no particular direction, a phenomenon we do not consider in our model. There are other classes of hyperparasites that depend on a functional virus for replication (e.g. virophages [53] or viroid-like satellites [54]) whose ecological dynamics could, with appropriate modifications, be described in the framework discussed here. Interestingly, it has been proposed that virus-satellite associations, a typically unrelated tandem from a phylogenetic viewpoint, might evolve towards full co-dependence, and therefore be a possible, alternative evolutionary pathway to multipartitism [5].",

A second population, occupying an adjacent geographic area, may have a different parameter (\u03bc^B>\u03bc^A), due to a different contact topology. As the inset of Fig 2C shows, the virus is able to colonize the second population only through an evolutionary process that increases its transmissibility up to at least \u03bbB\u2032, so that point B\u2032 is above the epidemic threshold (green path in the figure). It is reasonable to assume that the larger the increase in transmissibility required, the less likely this process is, given that the required mutation(s) are less likely and possibly more costly to maintain. The emergence of multipartitism decreases the evolutionary distance between the two states, increasing adaptability (magenta path in the figure). Random mutations, in fact, need to increase transmissibility from \u03bbA (wt-phase) to \u03bbB < \u03bbB\u2032 (all-phase), where a complementing, multipartite version of the virus can emerge. Invasion of the second population is now possible, because the new viral forms effectively lowers the epidemic threshold in \u03bc^B, thanks to the emergence of the seg-phase (point B). This simplistic example not only shows that multipartitism can emerge as a fitness-enhancing feature, but also that coexistence of monopartite and multipartite forms is a key stage in the evolutionary process, albeit possibly transient and short-lived. In addition to outlining the adaptive potential of multipartitism, this example elucidates the hampering effect of network heterogeneity. By increasing the distance between the wt-phase and the all-phase, network heterogeneity reduces the ratio \u03bbB\u2032/\u03bbB, making multipartitism less advantageous. In conclusion, while making viral persistence overall easier, network heterogeneity curbs the potential of multipartitism as an effective adaptation strategy.",

We have developed a framework that, starting from few key biological features, models the interaction between monopartite and multipartite forms, driven by the spreading dynamics on a host population. Despite assuming that multipartitism emerged from complementation between defective viral forms generated by the wt virus, as it has been observed in vitro, our results can be extended to other situations with relative ease. Most importantly, in addition, we have described how the structure of contacts among hosts drives the rise and persistence of the different viral forms. We have analytically characterized the parameter regions leading to viral persistence, in the form of wt only, of wt and defective segments, or segments only. We have also defined the different types of relationships between wt and segments, and specifically the presence or absence of selective pressure towards complementation, i.e., to witnessing the circulation of defective variants that may cooperatively reconstruct the whole genome. We have corroborated these findings through stochastic numerical simulations aimed at computing the prevalence of the different endemic states, and their probability of occurrence. As a result, we have been able to identify under which ecological conditions would multipartitism be a successful adaptive strategy, in the presence or absence of microscopic advantages, to new external conditions and environments characterized by variations in the topology of contacts between hosts. Defective particles generated through replication errors would start circulating by hijacking the wt. Subsequently, a complementing set of variants might form. Once that situation is achieved, even a small advantage in transmissibility (\u03c1 > 1) would give an advantage to the multipartite form, which could anyway replace the monopartite form if chance causes the stochastic extinction of the latter. This sequence of events represents a plausible, parsimonious evolutionary pathway to the rise and persistence of multipartite viruses, and clarifies in which manner multipartitism might be an effective adaptive strategy at the ecological level.",

This is not the case however for the terms with \u0393, so that the final equation is z\u02d9=(1-z)\u2211\u03b2(\u0393x)\u03b2-\u03bcz, which does not decouple from x\u03bd. Interestingly, despite this breaking of the SIS symmetry, which was crucial to solve the v = 1 model, we can still prove that the values of T1, T2 found for v = 1 generalize to an arbitrary number of variants. We start from the first critical surface (T1). We compute the Jacobian matrix of Eq (6) in the dfs, i.e., x\u03b2 = 0\u2200\u03b2. We get J(dfs) = \u0393 \u2212 \u03bc. We now argue that \u0393, and therefore the Jacobian matrix, is upper triangular, thanks to the specific ordering of the compartments that we introduced. \u0393\u03bd\u03b2 is the rate at which a susceptible becomes a \u231c\u03bd\u231f, upon contact with a \u231c\u03b2\u231f. For this to happen (\u0393\u03bd\u03b2 > 0), \u231c\u03b2\u231f must contain at least all the viral species \u231c\u03bd\u231f contains. Hence, either \u03b2 = \u03bd (diagonal term), or \u03b2 > \u03bd. By the same reasoning, the diagonal terms are \u0393\u03b2\u03b2 = \u03bb\u03c6(\u03b2), where \u03c6(\u03b2) is the number of viral species in \u231c\u03b2\u231f, e.g. \u03c6(\u231cwt\u231f) = 1, \u03c6(\u231call\u231f) = v+ 1. From these considerations, the spectrum of J(dfs) is {\u03bb\u03c6(\u03b2)\u2212\u03bc;\u2200\u03b2}. Keeping in mind that \u03bb < 1, we recover the first critical point: T1 = {\u03bb = \u03bc}.",

As customary, we assume \u03b3 > 2, so that the average degree is defined in arbitrary large populations. In the framework of annealed networks it makes sense to interpret k as a discrete number; one could also interpret it as a (continuous) coupling potential (either choice does not change the result found). We now directly compute the Jacobian of Eq (1), reported in Eq. (S.16) of S1 Text. The Jacobian is a matrix acting on a space which is the tensor product of the space of compartments, spanned by the Greek indices, and the space of degrees, spanned by the Latin indices. We can study its spectral properties on each space separately, using the previous results for the space of compartments. The full derivation is reported in the S1 Text.",
