            "text": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) comprise a large proportion of new HIV infections in Western countries. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that more than 60% of the newly diagnosed HIV cases in the United States in 2009 were MSM [1]. In the WHO European Region, the proportion of MSM among new HIV infections was estimated to be 20% in 2010 [2]. The epidemic has also increased among MSM populations in Africa and Asia; the UNAIDS report in 2010 showed that the HIV prevalence among MSM aged 15\u201349 years varied from 12% to 44% in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa [3]. Though MSM are not the principal subgroup driving HIV transmission in Southeast Asia, the proportion of new HIV infections among MSM has also increased in several Southeast Asian countries [4]. In China, the proportion of MSM among new HIV infections rose from 12.2% in 2007 to 29.4% in 2011 [5], [6]. The increasing HIV epidemic among Chinese MSM has been confirmed by recent meta-analyses: the national average prevalence from cross-sectional studies was 5.3% (95% CI: 4.8%\u20135.8%) in 2009 [7], and average incidence rate from cohort studies was 3.5% (95% CI: 1.7%\u20135.3%) [8]. This changing epidemic among Chinese MSM is contributable to increasing social tolerance to homosexuality and growing social networks of MSM, high efficiency of HIV transmission through unprotected receptive anal sex, and stigma and discrimination as barriers to HIV care [9], [10].This serious trend suggests the need for urgent and effective interventions among MSM globally, and in China in particular given the size and mobility of its population.",

Notable was the Regulation on the Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS, enacted by The State Council in 2006, that outlined the legal obligation of the government to make available comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention intervention and treatment programs [12]. Subsequently, China has invested substantial funds and human resources into public health programs for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, such as needle exchange and methadone maintenance programs for injection drug users [13], [14], and free combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) programs for rural and/or poor urban residents living with HIV/AIDS [15], [16]. China has also used technical support and funds from international organizations and other developed countries, especially the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GF). By 2011, China had successfully obtained the Global Fund round 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 projects (China GF-3, 4, 5, 6 & 8), and a combined one (China Consolidated GF Program) that aimed to scale up HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care in China to achieve universal access for high risk populations and PLWHA.",

Several issues regarding the coverage rate and intensity of interventions are worth mentioning. First, the coverage rate is defined as receipt of any of six intervention components, and it reached 90% by 2009. However, as an indicator of intervention intensity, the mean intervention score is low (3.1 out of 6.0). It was suggested that many MSM had missed some components of the intervention package. Second, the coverage rate among the study participants may not represent the overall coverage rate of the interventions for MSM in the cities targeted.

As China has become the world's second largest economy, major international programs for HIV/AIDS prevention and care have ended or will end soon, e.g. both GF and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations projects will end in 2012. It is therefore crucial for the local governments in the 15 cities with nascent epidemics to continue to invest in HIV prevention projects in order to prevent the concentrated epidemic in MSM from becoming a generalized epidemic in the whole population. In Chongqing City [24], the strategy should focus on both preventing new infections and treatment as prevention [25]. The Free China CARE program was originally developed for provide cART and care to drug users and plasma donors [15].

Even though we use participants who did not receive interventions to attempt to derive inferences of program impacts, they are from the same study cities as participants who received interventions and might have been affected by interventions due to intervention diffusion. This could lead to a smaller difference of impacts between two groups than if we had been able to study comparable non-intervention cities. The study design was not a prospective cohort study; therefore, we did not assess temporal relationship between the prevention exposure and the behavioral and disease outcomes. In addition, information on condom use was based on self-reporting, and might be subject to social desirability bias; HIV and syphilis infections were objectively assessed. Moreover, MSM are a marginalized population, and the socially inactive subgroup might be less likely to be reached by project interventions and to be recruited into the surveys through a snowball sampling approach; therefore, our study samples might not fully represent the whole population of MSM in the study cities. The intervention coverage rate and the prevalence rates of condom use and diseases might be overestimated, but the overestimation should not affect the general trends of these outcomes over time.",

Men who received interventions were more likely to use condoms and had lower HIV prevalence than those who did not receive interventions. It is vital for Chinese public health programs to reach persons who have not received intervention services and increase the coverage and intensity of effective MSM interventions in the future.",
