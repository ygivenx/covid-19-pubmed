A flagship military medical institute, it was a career defining opportunity. I remain indebted to the NGHA leadership who gave me full and free rein to develop my practice, and pursue my academic enquiries through clinical research all the while supporting and developing my skills as an administrator. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to the NGHA too\u2014it had a huge and critical impact on the Kingdom at a time of intense development of its nascent public health system, and through a series of public health challenges. Consistently the NGHA leadership supported me while I managed first a division of infectious disease and infection control and later an entire department of Infection Control and Occupational Health. At this institute, which employed fifty-three different nationalities I was involved in helping engage and retain academic and clinical talent as we competed in a global market for the best minds and clinicians around the world. Our clinical resources expanded rapidly as we caught up with the first world international healthcare environment, doing so in mere decades.

In these and many subsequent efforts the National Guard Health Affairs leadership's unwavering support fueled my strength and perseverance in making the institution an international beacon of excellence in Infection Control. Around this time, I established the Kingdom's first regional and international hub for Infection Control. Knowing how pivotal this was to public health, I personally lobbied for the recognition of Infection Control nationally in the Saudi Ministry of Health, and soon after, regionally, in the 6 Gulf Cooperation Council States (GCC). We in the Kingdom did this by developing a state of the art program in Infection Control as I envisioned it, inspired by my foundational mentors.

In Sept 2012, mere weeks before 2012 hajj season was to begin, this unknown agent put intense demands on both the Public health Deputyship and my entire team. While we had gained from the experience of H1N1 in our public health approaches and particularly the engagement of the international community, our newly formed MoH-international links and collaborations were put to the test in trying to understand this mysterious new virus.",

In the fullness of the MERS crisis, for the first time I recognized certain international entities, rather than seeking collaboration in an effort to secure a vulnerable and massive population were baldly engaging in opportunist competition. This was a painful shock to me personally. I grew with wisdom as a result and I am proud of the work my colleagues are pursuing in this area today.",

I enjoy teaching students at Princess Nora University, the world's largest university for women, and the Alfaisal University in Riyadh. At the bedside and in the clinic I reconnect with my origins: clinical infectious disease, infection control, academia and ongoing empiric research: the 4 pillars of practice I love most. If I have any regrets, it would be for the sacrifices my greatest love\u2014my family\u2014has made on my behalf. My intense work, and the challenging demands of a rapidly developing public health arena took me all too often away from my loved ones\u2014my wife and my children. For this enormous sacrifice I continually ask for their forgiveness and in their unending generosities, somehow I continue to receive their unconditional love.",

I have taken singular pride in the achievements of my colleagues, many of whom have assumed the international stage alongside me.
