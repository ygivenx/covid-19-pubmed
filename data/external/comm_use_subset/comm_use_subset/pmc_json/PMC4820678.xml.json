The first documented sizable outbreak of human ZIKV infection outside Africa and Asia occurred on Yap Island of the French States of Micronesia in 2007, during which 73% of the Yap population became infected.3 ZIKV then spread to other Pacific islands, and arrived in the western hemisphere in 2014 (Easter Island, Chile).4, 5, 6 Since then, many countries in the Americas have reported autochthonous cases of ZIKV infection. Brazil alone has reported an estimated 500 000\u20131 500 000 human cases of ZIKV infection in 2015.7 Although most patients with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, life-threatening complications such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, thrombocytopenic purpura, and fatal disseminated disease in immunosuppressed hosts have been reported.1, 3, 8 Furthermore, preliminary epidemiological and virological data suggest that congenital ZIKV infection may be associated with microcephaly and other congenital anomalies in infected fetuses.9, 10, 11 The rapidly expanding epidemic and this suspected congenital ZIKV syndrome have led the World Health Organization to declare the ZIKV outbreak as a global public health emergency on 1 February 2016.12",

            "text": "The cause of the sudden emergence and rapid spread of ZIKV since 2007 is incompletely understood. A number of possible environmental factors have been proposed. First, globalization and urbanization have allowed ZIKV and its mosquito vectors to spread beyond their original geographical habitats. Second, major sport events including the World Cup and the Va'a World Sprint Championship canoe race in Brazil in 2014 might have provided an opportunity for infected travelers to introduce the virus to Latin America.13 Third, climate changes associated with El Ni\u00f1o in South America in 2015 on the background trend of global warming possibly facilitated the rapid spread of Aedes mosquitoes and ZIKV.14 Fourth, the increased awareness of and diagnostic capability for ZIKV infection likely led to the increased detection of this previously neglected disease. In contrast, little is known about the virological factors possibly associated with the apparent change in the spread of ZIKV after 2007. Although it has been shown that the epidemic strains are phylogenetically more closely related to the Asian than the African lineage of ZIKV, a comprehensive comparative analysis between the pre-epidemic and epidemic strains is lacking.15 In this study, we performed comparative genomic analysis of all the pre-epidemic and epidemic strains with complete genome or complete polyprotein sequences available in GenBank to identify possible viral factors associated with this rapidly emerging viral epidemic.",

Similar to other flaviviruses, the coding region orders and NS protein motifs of ZIKV are arranged in the order of 5\u2032-Capsid (C)-preMembrane (prM)-Envelope (E)-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3\u2032. Cleavage at the N terminus of the signal sequence for NS4B generates a 23 amino acid peptide (the 2 K peptides at amino acid position 2243\u20132265). The complete polyprotein sequences of ZIKV have low similarity with those of other human-pathogenic flaviviruses (DENV-2, 58.1% to 58.9% SPOV, 68.3% to 69.0% nucleotide similarity). The ten structural and NS proteins contain multiple transmembrane domains that determine their location on the cytoplasmic or luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum after cleavage (Figure 1). Most of the transmembrane domains are found in the NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B proteins. This is compatible with the finding that the NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B proteins of other flaviviruses are mostly located within the endoplasmic reticular membrane bilayer, except for short regions between the transmembrane domains.19 The other NS proteins include NS1, a putative protease/helicase (NS3), and a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; NS5), which are essential components or enzymes involved in viral replication.19 Putative nuclear localization signals are found in C, NS1 and NS5 of both the pre-epidemic and epidemic strains, and NS3 of the prototype Uganda ZIKV strain (Figure 2). The putative O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites are mostly conserved, except for some variations at C, prM, E, NS1 and NS5 for O-glycosylation sites, and at E, NS2A and NS5 for N-glycosylation sites, which may be due to previous intracranial passage of the pre-epidemic Uganda and Malaysia ZIKV strains in mice.20",

Comparison between the pre-epidemic Asian lineage (Malaysia, 1966) and the epidemic ZIKV strains detected 24 amino acid substitutions (prM: 2, E: 3, NS2A: 1, NS3: 3, NS4B: 7 and NS5: 8) in the genomes of the latter virus strains (Figure 2). Four of these are associated with a change in the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the amino acids (T773M in E, Y2082H in NS3, L2451S in NS4B and T2630V in NS5).

The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal sequences of the genome of flaviviruses fold into conserved RNA secondary structures and encode regions essential for genome cyclization at the initial phase of replication.24 In mosquito-borne flaviviruses including ZIKV, the 3\u2032 UTR is further divided into three domains, including the highly variable proximal domain 1 that directly follows the stop codon, the moderately conserved domain 2 that contains the SL and DB structures, and the highly conserved domain 3 that contains the complementary cyclization elements and the conserved sHP-3\u2032 SL structure. Deletion of the SL sequences in the 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-UTR is lethal for flavivirus infectious clones.25, 26 These secondary RNA structures bind to host proteins, such as elongation factor 1\u03b1 and poly(A)-binding protein, and proteins of the viral replication complex, including C, NS2A, NS3 and NS5 proteins, to promote genomic RNA cyclization.27 Genomic RNA cyclization is essential for viral replication in two ways. First, the 5\u2032-SLA acts as a promotor element to stimulate the NS5 RdRp to initiate negative strand synthesis at the 3\u2032-UTR.28, 29, 30 Second, the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs move into close proximity for cap-dependent translation of the viral polyprotein to proceed.31, 32, 33",

The basic residues on one side of the C protein bind the RNA genome and the hydrophobic residues on the other side interact with the viral lipid envelope.34, 35 Even after virus-endosomal membrane fusion, the entering viral genome may remain associated with the C dimers to evade from host nucleases and RNA sensors. Thus, the C protein of flaviviruses may function as an RNA chaperone in addition to its role in the formation of viral nucleocapsid. The resulting nucleocapsid then buds into the endoplasmic reticular lumen to form viral particles with the prM and E proteins.36, 37 The C protein may also be found in the nuclei and nucleoli of cell lines infected by flaviviruses, including DENV-2, DENV-4, WNV, JEV and Kunjin virus.38, 39, 40 The migration of the C protein to the nuclei and nucleoli are believed to be mediated by nuclear localization signals.41 In ZIKV, we found one putative nuclear localization signal near the 3\u2032-end of the C protein, which is conserved in the pre-epidemic and epidemic strains (Figure 2A). JEV with a single point mutation (T45G) at the N terminus of the C coding region has reduced virulence.42 In our study, we found five amino acid substitutions in C protein including N25S, L27F, R101K, I110V and I113V, which were detected in the Asian ZIKV strains as compared with the prototype Uganda African ZIKV strain.
