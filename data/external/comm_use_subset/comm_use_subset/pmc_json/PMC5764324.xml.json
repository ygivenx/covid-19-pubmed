Based on the antigenic differences in the nucleoprotein (NP) and M1 matrix proteins (MP), influenza viruses are classified as types A, B and C. For type A viruses, further subtyping is based on the antigenicity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen HA (H1\u2014H16) and 9 NA (N1\u2014N9) subtypes have been recognized. The influenza virion contains negative-sense RNA (vRNA). The synthesis of influenza virus RNA occurs in three steps: (i) vRNA is transcribed into mRNA by a cap-snatching mechanism via RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; (ii) intermediate cRNA is synthesized from vRNA; and (iii) cRNA is copied to full-length negative-sense vRNA for encapsulation in new progeny virus particles [2,3].",

Thus, patient care depends upon the availability of effective antiviral drugs. However, emerging influenza viruses often become resistant to the available antiviral drugs because these drugs target the viral proteins [8,9]. Due to its small genome size, influenza virus is dependent on the host cell machinery for its replication and packaging. Many host factors utilized by influenza virus at various stages of the viral life cycle have been identified [10,11]. The development of antiviral drugs that target these factors can overcome the development of drug resistance that limits the use of current anti-influenza virus drugs.",

This pathway is activated by the binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled receptor. The central component of the pathway, \u03b2-catenin has two functions, one as an adaptor linking cadherins to the cytoskeleton at the cell membrane and another as a transcription factor. In the absence of Wnt ligands such as Wnt3a, cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin forms a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). Once bound, \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated, then ubiquitinylated by the \u03b2-transducin repeat-containing protein and degradated via the proteasome. When Wnt ligands are present, the complex is destabilized, leading to the accumulation and nuclear translocation of cytosolic \u03b2-catenin. In the nucleus, \u03b2-catenin interacts with the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (TCF/LEF) transcription factor to activate Wnt target genes along with other co-factors, CBP/p300. iCRT14 is an inhibitor of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling that disrupts the direct interaction between \u03b2-catenin and TCF4/LEF1[13]. This inhibitor also prevents the binding of TCF4 to DNA; however, iCRT14 does not affect non-canonical Wnt signaling or other pathways such as Hedgehog, JAK/STAT or notch signaling [13].",

Using the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling TOPflash reporter assay, we first validated that iCRT14 did inhibit the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Fig 2A). Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were then treated with 12.5 \u03bcM iCRT14 for 12 h and then infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at a MOI of 1 for varying amounts of time. Infectious virus particles released into the medium were quantified using a TCID50 assay. Virus titers in the iCRT14-treated cells were significantly reduced at 48 h post-infection (hpi) compared to the control cells (Fig 2B). Similar results were observed with A/WSN/33 virus (Fig 2C). This effect was not due to the toxicity of iCRT14 because iCRT14 had no effect on cell viability (Fig 2D). We also tested ability of iCRT14 to inhibit virus replication of various influenza virus strains by using an influenza virus sensor reporter assay. As expected, iCRT14 reduced the replication of A/PR/8/34 and A/WNS/33. In this assay, iCRT14 also inhibited the replication of clinical isolates of H1N1 pdm/Ok/2009 and H3N2 A/Wisconsin/67/05 (Fig 2E). These results indicate that iCRT14 has antiviral activity against multiple strains of influenza A virus.",

First, we examined the effects of iCRT14 on influenza virus A/PR/8/34-induced IFN gene expression. A/PR/8/34 induced the mRNA expression of IFN\u03b11 and IFN\u03b21 in A549 cells. However, iCRT14 had no effect on this induction (Fig 5A and 5B). Second, we repeated the experiment described in Fig 4 using Vero cells, which are deficient in IFN production [24,25]. iCRT14 reduced the levels of vRNA, cRNA and mRNA of the NP gene in Vero cells, similar to its effect in A549 cells (Fig 5C). These results suggest that IFNs may not play a major role in the antiviral activity of iCRT14.",

Cellular signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathway, Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) signaling, and toll-like receptor/retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (TLR/RIG-I) signaling cascades have been reported to play roles in various stages of the influenza virus replication cycle. NF-\u03baB signaling is essential for the host innate immune response and is activated by influenza virus infection [29]. Once activated, NF-\u03baB signaling increases influenza virus production by inducing proapoptotic factors [30]. Influenza virus also activates the MAPK pathway, and blocking this signaling pathway inhibits viral replication by impairing viral ribonucleoprotein trafficking [31]. Another pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway, is activated by influenza virus via the interaction of non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and p85\u03b2 [32]. During influenza virus infection, robust activation of the IFN response occurs, and this in turn activates the PKR signaling pathway. However, influenza virus also counteracts activation of the PKR pathway by the binding of NS1 to double-stranded RNA, thereby preventing translational arrest [33]. Pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) recognize viral RNAs and induce antiviral immune responses [34]. Influenza virus has also evolved mechanisms to counteract this induction of the antiviral response. For example, NS1 inhibits RIG-I activation and IFN production by binding to tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), an ubiquitin ligase that is required for RIG-I activation [35].",

            "text": "The mechanisms how Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling regulates influenza virus infection are unclear. There are several possibilities: (i) Modulation of immune response. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is known to modulate inflammatory and immune responses via the interaction with NF-\u03baB pathway [37]. However, the effect of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling on virus-induced immune responses remains controversial. For instance, Hillesheim et al has shown that activation of Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by overexpressing \u03b2-catenin supports the IAV-induced IRF3-dependent transcription of genes of cellular innate immune response, such as the IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs [36]. However, a recent study has demonstrated that induction of Wnt ligands by negative-strand RNA virus infection suppresses the type I IFN response. Our current studies do not support a role of type I IFN response in this context as the inhibitory effect of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitor iCRT14 on influenza virus infection was not via the enhancement of IFN response (Fig 5). (ii) Modulation of cell cycle and proliferation. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling promotes the G1/S transition through transcriptional upregulation of cell cycle related target genes such as c-Myc and cyclin D [38]. A proliferative status promoted by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling may: 1) provide abundant resource for virus cap snatching. This has been shown for another negative strand RNA virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, which selectively snatches cell cycle-related cellular mRNAs [39]; 2) allow the viral protein traffic between cytoplasm and nucleus more actively. For instance, Cawood et al has demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus is more mobile in proliferative cells and localizes to the nucleolus in a cell cycle-dependent manner [40].",

Mouse Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in vivo was also inhibited by iCRT14 [43]. However, there is a paucity of literature on the toxicity of iCRT14 in animals. Our 10-day toxicity study in mice did not reveal any major toxicity to organs, including lung, liver, kidney, brain, heart and eyes. In a sublethal influenza infection mouse model, iCRT14-treated mice showed less severe clinical signs, and this correlated with the observation that those mice had lower virus loads at 5 days post infection. Virus load was less in the iCRT14-treated group at 2 days post infection, however it did not reach a significant level. Although we believe this is due to lower titer at day 2 and animal variations, we can not rule out the possibility that iCRT14 eexerts secondary effects in animals. Influenza virus infection causes acute lung injury, including damage to endothelial and epithelial cells, disruption of the endothelial alveolar barrier, leakage of proteins into the alveolar space, and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, iCRT14 appears to have no effects on parameters of lung injury and inflammation other than a reduction in lung edema. In a lethal influenza infection, we observed only slightly less weight loss and slightly delayed mortality in iCRT14-treated mice. These end points could be used to improve the efficacy of iCRT14 using medicinal chemistry and formulation. Because iCRT14 reduced virus loads and improved clinical signs, combination therapy [44] with other drugs that reduce lung injury should increase the efficacy of iCRT14.",
