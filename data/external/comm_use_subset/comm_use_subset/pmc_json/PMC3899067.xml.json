The most common superficial candidiases are oral candidiasis and Candida-associated denture stomatitis [3]\u2013[5]. Candida-associated denture stomatitis could affect up to 70% of denture wearers [6].",

            "text": "The most prevalent candidiasis-causing species is Candida albicans. It has a versatile morphogenesis, existing in three forms (i.e., yeasts, pseudohyphae and hyphae), and has two lifestyles (planktonic and biofilm), permitting C. albicans to thrive under diverse environmental conditions. In particular, the yeast-to-hypha (Y-H) transition is a major virulence attribute that facilitates tissue invasion by C. albicans\n[7], [8]. In addition to Y-H transition, biofilm formation on host tissue or abiotic devices is also a significant basis for Candida infections [5], examples include Candida-associated denture stomatitis [9]. The formation of Candida biofilms, which are more resistant to antifungal agents than planktonic cells, is directly associated with treatment failure [5], [10]. Although Candida infections have always posed a heavy burden on public health, this situation has recently worsened. First, the worldwide incidence of candidiasis has been increasing over the past few decades [11], which may be attributable to increased numbers of immunocompromised patients and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics [12]. Second, the increased incidence of invasive candidiasis caused by non-albicans Candida (NAC) species, such as Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei or Candida parapsilosis, has been a major concern [13], [14], because these infections are often associated with higher mortality and antifungal resistance than those caused by C. albicans\n[15], [16]. Lastly, the emergence of antifungal resistance and treatment side effects have further restricted treatment options because of the already limited arsenal of current antifungal agents [17], [18].",

Polyenes, for example, have dose-related toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity (even though the recent introduction of lipid formulations has now improved the risk-benefit ratio) [20]. In addition, rising drug resistance is an inevitable problem. This is pertinent for fluconazole, a drug of choice for treating AIDS patients with Candida infections. While C. glabrata and C. krusei are intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains is also on the rise [21], [22]. Similarly, emerging resistance has also been reported for the more recently introduced echinocandins [23]\u2013[26]. Therefore, the situation is likely to be ameliorated only by the discovery and introduction of safe and new antifungal agents.",

Here, we sought small molecules with anti-Candida properties (with the overall strategy depicted in Figure 1). We first screened a collection of over 50,000 small molecules for inhibitors of the Y-H transition in C. albicans. The identified hits were further assessed for antifungal and anti-biofilm activity, which led us to discover a novel antifungal small molecule, which we designated SM21. We examined the in vitro antifungal activity of SM21, as well as its in vivo efficacy in mouse infection models of oral and systemic candidiases.

After incubation for 24 h, cell morphologies were observed by light microscopy (Olympus BH-2, Tokyo, Japan). The degree of Y-H inhibition was quantified by calculating the percentage of hyphal cells in one hundred cells in a single sample [29]. Counting was performed in quadruplicate for each sample. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Y-H transition (MICY-H) was determined as the minimum concentration at which no hyphae were observed.

One day before infection, C57BL/6 mice were immunosuppressed by subcutaneous injection of two doses of prednisolone (100 mg/kg body weight), and the antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride (0.83 mg/ml) was administered in the drinking water. Immediately before infection, the mice were anesthetised with 50 \u00b5l chlorpromazine chloride (2 mg/ml) via intramuscular injection on each femur. The oral cavities of the anesthetised mice were swabbed with a sterilised cotton swab that had been dipped in a cell suspension of C. albicans SC5314 (2.5\u00d7107 CFUs/ml; from cultures grown overnight at 37\u00b0C on SDA). Subsequently, 10 \u00b5l SM21 (200 \u00b5g/ml; n = 3), 10 \u00b5l nystatin (10 \u00b5g/ml; n = 3) or 10 \u00b5l PBS (as a control; n = 3) was administered to the mice by pipetting into their mouths; this was done five times, at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 h after inoculation. The mice were sacrificed 72 h after infection and were immediately observed macroscopically for tongue lesions. The tongue lesion degree was evaluated using a scoring system of 0 \u2013 3 [40], with 0 denoting a healthy tongue surface and 3 the most severe stage. The entire oral cavities of the mice were swabbed with sterilised cotton swabs, which were then submerged in 500 \u00b5l PBS and vortexed vigorously. The resultant suspension was spiral plated on SDA, and the number of CFUs was counted after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. In addition, the invasion of tongue tissues by Candida was evaluated histologically by PAS staining, as described above.",

Immediately after sacrifice (72 h after inoculation), scores were assigned for tongue lesions from 0 (healthy tongue surface) to 3 (most severe stage). Thick oral thrush was observed in the untreated mice (score = 3; Figure 13A). Tongue lesions in the nystatin-treated mice were less severe than in the untreated controls, although considerable oral thrush was noted at the back of the tongue (score = 2). Compared with the other two groups, SM21-treated mice displayed the least severe tongue lesions (score = 1). Moreover, Candida cell counts from tongue swabs of the SM21-treated mice (4.5\u00d7102 CFUs/ml) were consistently lower than those of the control mice (4.8\u00d7103 CFUs/ml) and the nystatin-treated animals (6.0\u00d7102 CFUs/ml).

It has been hypothesised that arresting Candida in the unicellular yeast form would result in reduced virulence. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that non-filamentous C. albicans mutants are not virulent in a mouse infection model [48], however, this is only relevant to C. albicans. Some NAC species (which do not form true hyphae) are also virulent. Moreover, the strategy of inhibiting virulence factors could facilitate the emergence of resistant strains because it only inhibits the growth of virulent strains but does not kill them. Complete elimination of pathogen is clearly a safer option; therefore, fungicidal drugs are preferred.",

Therefore, this assay does not discriminate between molecules that inhibit the growth of C. albicans, which would also prevent the Y-H transition, and true inhibitors of the Y-H transition. Moreover, conventional antifungal agents such as fluconazole, amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, whose mechanisms are not directly related to Y-H inhibition, also inhibit the formation of hyphae [49].

Although this value is lower than the minimum CC50 (16 \u00b5M) reported for 14 antifungal compounds that were identified by LaFleur et al (tested against human fibroblasts in 96-well plates; [45]), the CC50 of SM21 is still higher than its MIC (0.2 \u00b5g/ml), which indicates that there is a range of concentrations at which SM21 could be used as an antifungal agent without causing significant toxicity to human cells. Indeed, no detrimental effects were observed in mice that had been injected with SM21 doses as high as 10 mg/kg twice daily.

An SM21 dose of 0.1 mg/kg or higher twice daily beginning 3 h post-infection significantly reduced fungal burden in non-neutropenic mice. The in vivo efficacy of SM21 is similar to that of conventional antifungal agents in comparable non-neutropenic mouse models of systemic C. albicans candidiasis. For example, the intraperitoneal ED50 (50% effective dose) of fluconazole is 4.56 mg/kg when administered to the mice as a single dose 5 h after infection; the animals were sacrificed 24 h later [55]. Intraperitoneal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg dose daily) decreases fungal burden in mouse kidneys from day 1 to day 3 after infection (with treatment beginning 24 h after infection) [56]. In addition, intravenous micafungin treatment (0.125 mg/kg or higher daily dose, starting 1 h after infection for 4 days) prolongs survival of infected mice [57]. However, it is difficult to compare the effective doses from different studies because there is no standard protocol, and differences in the Candida strain, inoculum size, mouse strain, mouse immune status and the start and interval of antifungal therapy could interfere with the outcome. In addition, there are differences in the in vivo drug efficacy among normal and neutropenic murine models, which may be due to the possible interactions between the drug and host defence mechanisms [56]. Detailed pharmacodynamics-pharmacokinetics studies would need to be performed in the future to determine the time/concentration relationship of the drug at the infection sites and, thus, to generate the dosing regimens that produce the best treatment outcome in vivo\n[58].",

Finally, the anti-biofilm activity of the four hits was evaluated, and SM21 was chosen for comprehensive in vitro and in vivo assays.
