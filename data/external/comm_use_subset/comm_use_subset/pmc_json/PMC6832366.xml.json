            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that are widespread in humans alongside various mammalian and avian species. They cause enteric, respiratory, or systemic diseases of variable severity [1,2]. CoVs belong to the Coronaviridae family that contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), Betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), Gammacoronavirus (\u03b3-CoV) and Deltacoronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) [3]. The virus evolves through an accumulation of point mutations and both homologous and non-homologous recombination. It is hypothesized that this ability to recombine allows the virus to evolve and create new forms which can target different species [4]. \u03b1-CoV and \u00df-CoV infect multiple species of mammals, but \u03b3-CoV is only known to infect birds. In contrast, \u03b4-CoVs are found in both birds and mammals including pigs [4]. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) emerged in the US in 2014 as a new enteropathogenic CoV causing diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in economic losses to the swine industry [4,5]. Its origin is unknown, but it is hypothesized that it may have spilled over from an avian host.",

In a screening study of 918 wild Australian birds, 141 of them tested positive for CoVs. After sequencing, \u03b4-CoV was detected in pacific black ducks, curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons [6]. However, \u03b3-CoV (80% of sequenced samples) was identified more frequently than \u03b4-CoV (20% of sequenced samples) [6]. \u03b3-CoV was also detected in quails and pheasants in Italy [7]. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) analyses found that quail were also infected with \u03b4-CoV [7]. Wild birds harbor genetically diverse \u03b4-CoV with some of them potentially transmittable to pigs [8]. A previous report from Brazil showed that \u03b4-CoVs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds, purple-breasted-parrot and plain parakeet. These avian CoVs were monophyletically related to CoVs from Sparrow (SPaCoV HKU19) and swine (PorCoV HKU15), which were also found to be \u03b4-CoV. This information supports the hypothesis that \u03b4-CoV can cross inter-species barriers, with the potential to transmit from birds to swine [8].",

These three novel \u03b4-CoVs clustered with a \u03b4-CoV detected in Asian leopard cats [10]; however, further studies are necessary to understand interspecies transmission from birds [9]. In a surveillance study in Hong Kong and Cambodia, \u03b4-CoVs were found in different wild aquatic birds: gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species [11]. \u03b4-CoVs do not cause severe illness in birds, leading to their endemic nature in the avian population [11]. In a screening study for \u03b4-CoVs in China, none were found in Asian leopard cats, bats, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, humans, monkeys, and rodents [12]. The investigators discovered seven novel \u03b4-CoVs in pigs and wild birds (white-eye, sparrow, magpie robin, night heron, wigeon, and common moorhen) [12]. Genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis showed that avian and swine \u03b4-CoVs had similar genome characteristics and structures [12]. Similarly, a recent study in the US described a novel sparrow \u03b4-CoV that clustered together with PDCoV [13] and other terrestrial, but aquatic bird \u03b4-CoVs.",

Extensive epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate \u03b4-CoV prevalence in avian species, swine farms, pig\u2013bird comingling sites and high pig-traffic sites such as abattoirs, assembly yards and truck washes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of \u03b4- and \u03b3-CoVs in wild migratory terrestrial and aquatic birds in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.",

Of note, the red-tailed hawk was sampled upon intake to a wildlife rehabilitation center. Interestingly, the prevalence of \u03b4-CoV in aquatic birds was 1.34% compared to only 0.6% in terrestrial birds, suggesting that aquatic birds represent an important natural reservoir for CoVs.

To address this gap, we conducted sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the \u03b4-CoVs identified in this study. All amplicons generated with degenerate UDCoV-specific primers were confirmed to contain \u03b4-CoV N-gene sequences sharing ~69%\u201380% nucleotide identity with various avian \u03b4-CoV species. However, due to a high number of degenerate nucleotides incorporated in these primers to allow for broad reactivity and detection of highly diverse porcine and avian \u03b4-CoVs, the amplicons were not of satisfactory quality, with up to 10% of ambiguous nucleotides (Ns). Thus, we selected 4 \u03b4-CoV positive samples (Table 2) that had sufficient amounts of RNA and subjected them to NGS sequencing (Table 2). For one of the samples, Blue Winged Teal coronavirus/USA/Illinois2562/2017, NGS recovered approximately 42% of eukaryotic (host genome; normal; incidental), 20% bacteria, 5% virus, and 33% other. Bacterial reads identified Fusobacterium nucleatum (18%), while further analyses of viral and \u201cother\u201d reads identified various bacteriophage (80%). Eighty-five reads were identified as \u03b4-CoV including fragments of ORF1a/b, S, M, N and NS7a genes. Blast search and phylogenetic analysis identified that these genomic fragments shared the highest nucleotide identity (87%\u201393%) with Wigeon CoV HKU20, without evidence of recent recombination events (Figure 2A\u2013C). For the other three samples, there were variable amounts of eukaryotic (2%\u201374%), bacterial (1%\u201320%), viral (5%\u201392%) and other/bacteriophage (5%\u201333%) reads; but no \u03b4-CoV sequence was recovered. This suggests that \u03b4-CoV RNA in these samples was present in insufficient amounts or was of low quality.",

Thus, the role of wild avian species in the ecology of \u03b4-CoVs in the US is unknown. Environmental sampling of high-risk and co-mingling sites in Alberta and Saskatchewan Canada, identified \u03b4-CoV in sparrows, that are closer phylogenetically to porcine \u03b4-CoVs than to those from waterfowl [19]. To date, the presence of \u03b4-CoV is confirmed in sparrows in Canada and the US [13], in quail in Brazil [20] and in various birds in Australia [6], suggesting that \u03b4-CoVs circulate in different avian species in the Americas. Since porcine \u03b4-CoV often results in severe clinical disease and mortality in piglets, which impacts the swine industry, it is important to understand the morbidity and interspecies transmission rates between birds and pigs [4,5]. Due to their flocking behavior and abilities to fly long distances, birds can play a role in the dissemination of \u03b4-CoVs among themselves and other animals [12].",

However, this is higher compared with that observed in our previous study (0.5%) that analyzed Ohio samples from the period 2013\u20132014 [16]. Also, of these 14 positive samples, only up to 4 originated from the same state, suggesting that \u03b4-CoVs spread with low efficiency in the avian species tested. Additionally, our inability to recover CoV sequences by NGS suggests that they are present in the samples at lower frequency compared with other microorganisms. The latter is more suggestive of asymptomatic carrier status as opposed to acute infection associated with clinical disease. These findings suggest that avian species likely represent a natural reservoir of \u03b4-CoVs, while pigs and other mammals serve as spillover hosts.",

This suggests that aquatic birds may represent a natural reservoir for CoVs of terrestrial birds and pigs, and their concentration or survival may be increased in water sources compared with other avian habitats. Similarly, in a surveillance study in Hong Kong and Cambodia, \u03b4-CoV was found in different wild aquatic bird species including gray herons, pond herons, great cormorants, black-faced spoonbills, and several duck species, whereas \u03b3-CoVs were found in little whistling ducks, tufted ducks, common teals, northern shovelers, eurasian wigeons, and northern pintails [11]. In wild Australian birds, \u03b4-CoV was detected in pacific black ducks, but it was also detected in terrestrial birds such as curlew sandpiper, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, and pied herons [6]. This suggests that wild birds are major reservoirs of a wide range of \u03b4- and \u03b3-CoVs, and the circulation of CoVs without association with clinical disease is more common than previously recognized [11]. However, it is important to note that \u03b4-CoVs identified in terrestrial birds and pigs are more similar each other phylogenetically [12,13,21], and those from aquatic/wading birds are genetically more distinct. It is of interest, that prevalence of both \u03b3- (92%) and \u03b4-CoVs (86%, Table 1) was higher in colder (October\u2013February) than in warmer (March\u2013September) months. This indicates that, similar to previous findings on avian, animal and human CoVs, there are may be seasonal (and migration associated) fluctuations in the prevalence of avian coronaviruses in wild bird in the US [22,23,24,25].",

Although, we did not identify \u03b4-CoV strains genetically similar to sparrow and porcine \u03b4-CoVs, it is important to note that porcine \u03b4-CoV outbreaks in the US were predominantly detected in the states with the highest density of pig population that in turn have a significant geographical overlap with the Mississippi Flyway (Figure 4) [26]. While a small pilot study failed to identify porcine \u03b4-CoVs in wild waterfowl in the Mississippi Flyway [27], the overlap of the bird migratory pathways and high density swine farms creates favorable conditions for birds and pigs to exchange \u03b4-CoV pools directly or through some other intermediate hosts.",

The close relatedness of all the strains we were able to sequence to HKU20 suggests a recent introduction of \u03b4-CoVs in the US and identification of this strain as potentially parental. We also demonstrated that aquatic birds are infected with \u03b4-CoVs and \u03b3-CoVs more frequently than terrestrial avian species. This, together with the observation that porcine \u03b4-CoVs are more closely related to \u03b4-CoVs identified in terrestrial birds, suggests that waterfowl might represent a natural reservoir for \u03b4-CoVs. Although \u03b3-CoVs were more prevalent than \u03b4-CoVs, consistent with previous studies, both CoVs were detected more frequently during the cold season in our study. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of aquatic bird \u03b4-CoVs in the epidemiology of \u03b4-CoVs in swine and terrestrial birds. It remains to be established: (i) if/how long avian \u03b4-CoVs were present in South and North America prior to the porcine \u03b4-CoV outbreaks in the period 2013\u20132014; (ii) which avian species represent significant natural \u03b4-CoV reservoirs; and (iii) what is the potential of avian \u03b4-CoVs to cross the interspecies barrier and infect swine.",
