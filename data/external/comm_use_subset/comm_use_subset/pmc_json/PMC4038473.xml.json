Although HFMD is most commonly caused by members of the coxsackievirus family, which are genetically related to EV71, infection with EV71 is more often associated with neurological complications in children under 3 years of age and is responsible for the majority of fatalities [1]\u2013[3]. A major concern has been the emergence of a syndrome of rapidly fatal pulmonary edema associated with brainstem encephalitis in the Asian epidemics [4]. In an outbreak of HFMD in 2008 in China, up to half a million cases were reported among children resulting in over 120 fatal cases, which were primarily due to EV71 infection [5]. A recent outbreak in Cambodia led to the deaths of 54 children, most of them under 3 years of age: All samples obtained from fatal cases tested positive for EV71. Since the nearly complete eradication of polio, EV71 is now regarded as the pre-eminent neurotrophic virus, and a threat to global public health [6], [7]. To date, there are no specific antivirals or vaccines for clinical use, and prevention is mainly achieved by disrupting virus transmission with improved public hygiene in kindergartens, preschools and daycare centers aided by the temporary closures of affected places.",

Further, studies on patients have indicated that EV71 infection is cleared by humoral immunity and clinical trials have shown the presence of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of immunized healthy adults and children [13], [15], [16]. This significant involvement of neutralizing antibody responses in the control of EV71 infection in humans would render IVIG treatment an ideal therapeutic agent to complement vaccination. Passive immunization by IVIG with pooled sera from convalescent human donors has been pioneered by Behring & Kitasato in the 1890's with the development of anti-diphtheria serum. However, besides the risk of transmitting human pathogens using pooled human sera, necessitating screening and treatment, there are other disadvantages, i.e. the availability of donors, batch to batch variability, and the presence in the serum of virus specific but non-neutralizing antibodies. A solution would be to exploit future passive immunotherapy based on monoclonal antibodies (mAb) produced in cell culture.",

            "text": "EV71 is a small non-enveloped single positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family, genus Enterovirus, species Enterovirus A. The naked genome is enclosed in an icosahedral capsid composed of the four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4). While VP1-VP3 form the surface of the virion, VP4 is arranged internally [17], [18]. The rapid mutation rate of RNA viruses results in the emergence of new subgenogroups every few years. To date, 11 EV71 subgenogroups have been identified based on the VP1 capsid protein which is the most variable of the four [19], [20]. The three genogroups are denoted A, B and C, of which B and C are further divided into subgenogroups B1\u20135 and C1\u20135 [19]. Both the co-circulation of different genogroups and the emergence of novel strains have been observed in the Asian pandemics [21]\u2013[24]. Interestingly, it has been shown that this genotyping does not correspond to the virus strain antigenicity which points to the presence of conformational epitopes, independent of sequence homology [25]\u2013[29]. It is surprising then, that only 1 universal neutralizing epitope of EV71 has been described thus far, i.e. a linear epitope on VP1 which encompasses amino acids 215-KQEKD-219 [30]. This region is conserved among all EV71 subtypes - making it a universal neutralizing epitope - and a monoclonal antibody against this epitope is able to protect mouse pups from lethal EV71 infection [30]. Given that other picornaviruses such as poliovirus carry multiple neutralizing epitopes (including conformational epitopes), we expect EV71 to also possess more than one linear neutralization epitope [31]. Indeed, this is the case as we here report the isolation of the first conformational, universally neutralizing mAb against EV71 that is not on VP1.",

This is a promising feature as the mAb could potentially be applied for differential diagnosis of HFMD to distinguish CVA from EV71 infections. Secondly, the mAb was able to neutralize all EV71 subgenogroups with a neutralization titer of 26 (genogroups A, B) to 28 (genogroup C) against 100 TCID50 of wild-type virus(Table 1) by using hybridoma cell supernatant. This universal neutralization ability makes mAb 10D3 an ideal candidate for diagnosis and treatment of EV71 infection. Since Western blot analysis against whole virus and overlapping EV71 P1 polyprotein fragments tagged with GST did not result in any bands with mAb 10D3, we investigated the reactivity of mAb 10D3 with native and denatured viruses in a dot blot assay. Although mAb 10D3 reacted with reverse genetically engineered wild-type B4 virus (RG/B4-wt) blotted in its native form (RG/B4-wt native), it did not recognize virus denatured by boiling with SDS (RG/B4-wt denatured) (Fig. 2F). MAb 53, which recognizes a linear epitope on VP1, was used as a positive control, and could indeed react with both the native and denatured viruses [30]. In conclusion, mAb 10D3 recognizes a conformational epitope. Finally, the mAb 10D3 immunoglobulin isotype was determined as IgM using the mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., USA).",

Wild-type EV71 viruses from different subgenogroups (A, B2, B4, C2, C4) were incubated with an excess of mAb 10D3 on RD cells.

To test this hypothesis, we engineered an EV71-B4 virus consisting of the EV71-B4 (5865/SIN/000009) sequence by utilizing a human RNA polymerase I driven reverse genetics system [35]. The four VP3 mutations P59L, A62D, A62P and E67D were then introduced alone (RG/B4-P59L, RG/B4-A62D, RG/B4-A62P, RG/B4-E67D) or in tandem (RG/B4-PE59, 67LD) into the wild-type RG virus (B4 RGV) by site-directed mutagenesis. The RG viruses were then rescued in RD cells and passage 2 viruses were used in subsequent experiments. The binding ability of mAb 10D3 to the representative mutated RG viruses RG/B4-P59L, RG/B4-E67D and RG/B4-PE59,67LD was first tested by IFA (Fig. 2DE), and dot blot (Fig. 2F). RD cells were infected with RG/B4-wt virus as positive control or the mutated RG viruses. The cells were fixed 2 dpi when CPE was clearly observed (Fig. 2E). While the original virus (RG/B4-wt) was clearly detected by mAb 10D3, no fluorescence was visible for the mutated RGVs carrying either a single or double mutations. Additionally, mAb 10D3 was unable to neutralize the mutated RG viruses (RG/B4-P59L, RG/B4-A62D, RG/B4-A62P, RG/B4-E67D, RG/B4-PE59,67LD) by an in vitro microneutralization assay, while the neutralization titer of mAb 10D3 against RG/B4-wt reached 26 which was the same as for B4-wild-type (Table 4). As a positive control, mAb 51 against the linear neutralizing epitope KQEKD on VP1 was incubated with the mutated RG viruses. Since the VP1 epitope was unaffected by our mutagenesis, mAb 51 was still able to efficiently neutralize all RG viruses (Fig. 3). Hence we have demonstrated that the four escape mutations (P59L, A62D, A62P and E67D) are sufficient for the abolishment of mAb 10D3 binding to the VP3 protein and neutralization of EV71 virus.",

In Fig. 4 the epitopes of mAb 51, 7C7 and 10D3 are shown on the virus surface. In Fig. 5 and 6 the EV71 VP3 protein is shown and the escape mutations P59L, A62D, A62P and E67D are indicated. Both sites lie on the major protrusion of VP3 on the capsid surface termed \u201cknob\u201d [18]. In Fig. 5B and 5C, a protomer consisting of one copy each of the viral capsid proteins VP1 (pink), VP2 (blue), VP3 (brown) and VP4 (green) is shown. The top of the image corresponds to the surface of the virion and the bottom (where VP4 is located) to the inside. Two orientations are shown: (B) The major groove, formed by VP1, is visible to the right, while VP2 is in the foreground and VP3 in the back. (C) The image was rotated to display the positions of the escape mutations on VP3 more clearly. VP1, VP3 are now in the foreground and VP2 in the back.

One day later, they were challenged with a lethal dose of the virulent EV71 strain HFM41, and clinical scores as well as survival rates of the mice were monitored daily. In the control animals, which received an isotype antibody, 80% developed severe limb paralysis as early as day 6 post-infection. In contrast, the mice pre-treated with mAb 10D3 did not display any of the disease manifestations, and remained healthy throughout the experiment. Our result thus suggested that the anti-EV71 antibody mAb 10D3 (administered at a dose of 10 mg/g of body weight) was able to achieve 100% protection against the lethal EV71 challenge. To confirm the protective efficacy of mAb 10D3, a histopathologic examination of the mouse brains was conducted. Mice from the isotype control group exhibited neuronal vacuolation and neuronal loss without inflammation in the brain stem (Figs. 7A, 7B1, 7B2 and 7B3). In contrast, we did not observe such pathologic changes in mice from the prophylactic group treated with 10D3. The intact brain morphology (Figs. 7C and 7D) suggested that mAb 10D3 was capable of conferring in vivo passive protection against EV71 infection.",

In order to find an optimal mAb for future use as an immunologic therapeutic, either alone or in conjunction with mAb 51, a larger pool of universally neutralizing mAb candidates would be desired. We therefore undertook the task of isolating such mAbs derived from mice immunized with EV71-B4 (5865/SIN/000009). This strain was selected for its virulence, as it consistently attained a higher TCID50 in cell culture and was able to cause disease in older mice pups than any other strain we tested (unpublished observations). This strain was isolated from a fatal case of HFMD with encephalitis during the Singapore outbreak of EV71 in 2000 [40]. We found that mAb 10D3 that efficiently neutralized all EV71 subgenogroups without cross-reaction to CVA16, making it a highly specific antibody with a potential application in differential diagnosis of HFMD. Since the epitope of 10D3 was found to be conformational, it was crucial to generate escape mutants in order to map the exact epitope. Mutations of amino acids proline to leucine at position 59, alanine to aspartic acid or proline at position 62, or glutamate to aspartate at position 67 of VP3 resulted in escape from mAb binding and neutralization. These residues are integral to the \u201cknob\u201d structure of EV71 VP3 protein that protrudes out of the capsid surface, and is completely conserved among all EV71 sequences deposited in GenBank. Hence, we have discovered an additional conformational epitope of EV71, and provided the first evidence of another capsid protein involved in EV71 virus neutralization besides VP1.",

In hepatitis A virus the immunodominant epitope involves residue 70 of VP3 which is close to the mutations identified in our screen [44]. The situation is more complex for poliovirus: while N-AgI is the major neutralizing epitope for the PV-3 serotype (Sabin), N-AgII and N-AgIII are immunodominant for PV-1 (Mahoney) [45]. However, neutralizing IgA mAbs, derived from both PV-1 and PV-3 immunized mice, were all predominantly directed against the N-AgIII epitope [46], [47] which is formed by amino acids 58\u201359 of VP3 and 286\u2013290 of VP1 [31]. Mapped onto the EV71 virus structure, these residues are in close proximity of the VP3 knob and pass right in front of (Fig. 5B pink tube at the upper right of the protomer structure).

Stereographic imaging revealed that the two mutations lie in close proximity to one another, forming a conformational epitope [41]. By analogy to CVB3, we more closely analyze the other identified epitopes of EV71. Since our previously identified, non-neutralizing, linear mAb 7C7 against EV71 VP2 has a linear epitope quite close to CVB3 VP2 158, i.e. residues 142\u2013146 [37], we investigated whether these amino acids might be involved in forming a conformational epitope with VP3 in EV71 as well. As can be readily deduced from the stereographic images, the VP2 puff of EV71 resides much further away from the VP3 knob, and neither residues 142\u2013146 nor 158 are in close proximity to our identified escape mutations. Instead, the VP2 epitope 142-EDSHP-146 is adjacent to the neutralizing VP1 epitope 215-KQEKD-219 indicating that these two linear epitopes may interact in EV71 which could explain the low (<1\u223614) neutralizing activity observed for the commercially available mAb979 (Merck Millipore, Germany) which recognizes a peptide of VP2 spanning residues 136\u2013150 which encompasses the 7C7 epitope [48].",

They offer a selective advantage over pooled human sera that are more commonly used in IVIG treatment by reducing the risk of transmitting pathogens, and by alleviating batch-to-batch variability, availability of donors, and the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies. Several factors have to be considered when using mAbs instead of polyclonal serum for IVIG, including (a) the antigenic variability of circulating strains, i.e. the mAb must cross-neutralize all existing subtypes to be useful; (b) The risk of escape mutations, e.g. mutants may emerge under selective pressure such as the presence of a neutralizing antibody. To circumvent this risk, a cocktail of two antiviral mAbs against non-overlapping epitopes can be administered, where escape mutation from a single mAb does not interfere with the neutralizing capability of the second mAb. A combination of synergistic mAbs may also reduce the required dosages [49], [50]. In conclusion, the protective efficacy of mAb 10D3 was evaluated and verified by an animal challenge experiment using a lethal dose of EV71. All mice prophylactically treated with mAb 10D3 survived the lethal challenge without showing any disease symptoms. Hence, mAb 10D3 holds promise for being further developed as a prophylactic agent against EV71-associated HFMD.",

(D, E) RG viruses were engineered using the wild-type B4 backbone. The representative escape mutations P59L and E67D were introduced individually (RG/B4-P59L, RG/B4-E67D) or together (RG/B4-PE59,67LD). RD cells were infected with RG/B4-wt and mutated RG viruses for 2 days until CPE was visible (E). Cells were then fixed and labeled with mAb 10D3 followed by FITC coupled secondary antibody. While RG/B4-wt gave a clear IFA signal, the signal was abolished in all three mutated RGVs (D). (F) Dot blot of reverse genetically (RG) engineered EV71-B4 viruses. RG/B4-wt viruses were blotted either native or after denaturing with SDS. While mAb 53, which recognizes a linear epitope on VP1, recognized both forms, mAb 10D3 only reacted with the native form. Introduction of the representative escape mutations P59L and E67D into the RG viruses resulted in a loss of recognition by mAb 10D3 when they were blotted in a native form.",
