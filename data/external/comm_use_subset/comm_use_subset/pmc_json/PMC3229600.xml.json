The linear, non-segmented HCV genome of 9.6 kb encodes a polyprotein that undergoes post-translational cleavage by cellular and viral proteases to yield at least 10 mature proteins [2]\u2013[4]. HCV infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and is the major cause of liver cancer in the United States. HCV produces a chronic infection in 50\u201380% of infected patients; among them, roughly 20% will eventually develop liver cirrhosis. It is widely accepted that insufficient host immune response in eliminating HCV leads to persistent infection and the eventual development of liver diseases [4]\u2013[6]. Interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin treatments have been prescribed either to stimulate immune response for clearance of viruses or to disrupt viral replication. However, high toxicity and low efficacy toward the two most prevalent HCV subtypes, 1a and 1b, in the US has been a barrier to effective eradication of persistent HCV infections [7].",

            "text": "To address the pathogenesis caused by HCV infection, recent studies have begun to focus on direct cytopathic effects. HCV proteins associate with different subcellular structures, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lipid droplets, to facilitate replication and assembly of viral particles [2]. These associations lead to alterations of the integrity and functions of organelles. HCV-mediated oxidative stress is commonly observed and is achieved by increasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) or by altering cellular antioxidant capacities [8]\u2013[11]. In particular, HCV core proteins are shown to be closely associated with the mitochondria and cause increases in ROS and RNS production and lipid peroxidation [11]\u2013[14], reduction in GSH and NADPH concentrations, reduction in mitochondrial complex I activities, and increase in mitochondrial Ca+2 uptake, which ultimately disrupts mitochondrial membrane permeability and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [14], [15]. HCV non-structural proteins have also been implicated in disturbing the redox balance and altering antioxidant enzyme levels [16], [17]. Specifically, NS5A is shown to up-regulate Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) through AP1 transcription factor in the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways [18], [19]. Additional studies showed the involvement of NS5A in ER stress and disturbance of intracellular Ca+2 homeostasis, which leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production and altered mitochondrial function [18], [20]. Because of the relationship between chronic HCV infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, studies have also been carried out to identify HCV proteins that may be responsible for the hepatocarcinogenesis. For example, the HCV core protein has been shown to promote immortalization of primary human hepatocytes [21], whereas the non-structural proteins NS3 and NS4B have been shown to transform NIH 3T3 cells either individually or in combination with Ha-ras [22], [23].",

We hypothesize that different components of HCV polyprotein, depending on their subcellular distributions, cause different types of cytopathic effects and elicit different types of responses in different subcellular compartments. To obtain a better understanding of the various cytopathic effects of and cellular responses to HCV proteins, we used hepatoma cells constitutively expressing the HCV genome-length replicon, the subgenomic replicon, or the core protein to model the state of persistent HCV infection and took a comparative approach to dissecting the role of various HCV proteins in cellular pathogenesis in this study.",

To identify the subcellular location of HCV proteins in genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells, immunogold EM was carried out with antibodies against core, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. The majority of core, NS5A, and NS5B proteins were located in the mitochondria and the ER with minor differences in their distribution within these organelles (Figure 1A and Table S1). Positive signals were also observed in the nucleus, lipid droplets, and the Golgi. NS5A signals were observed in autophagocytic vacuoles in 25% of the electron micrographs examined, with an average signal intensity of 3\u20136 gold particles per autophagocytic vacuole (Table S1).",

The study results revealed mitochondrial injury as a common defect among genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells with enlarged mitochondria and focal loss of cristae (Figure 1B). Consistent with this observation, measurement of the cross sectional area of mitochondria directly from electron micrographs showed a significant increase in mitochondrial sizes (Figure 2A). The data indicates mitochondrial degeneration and the possible loss of mitochondria. Consequently, the number of mitochondria per cell was significantly reduced (Figure 2B). In addition to mitochondrial defects, accumulation of lipid droplets was common among all three HCV protein-expressing cell lines (Figure 1B and Figure S2). Genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells also showed focally dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and prominent presence of autophagocytic vacuoles (Figures 1B and 3A).",

To determine the extent of ROS generation in the mitochondria, MitoSOX was used for live cell staining. The results showed a significant increase in ROS production in the mitochondria across all three cell lines (Figures 2C and 2D). After adjusting to the average number of mitochondria per cell, the level of MitoSOX intensity was similar among genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells. Cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases (ACO1 and ACO2) are very sensitive to inactivation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and reduction in aconitase protein levels and enzyme activities have been used as indicators for increased oxidative stress in their respective subcellular compartments [24], [25]. Our studies showed that ACO1 existed at low levels, whereas ACO2 was barely detectable by western blot analysis, in Huh7 and HCV protein-expressing cells. ACO1 protein level was reduced by 18% in cells with the genome-length replicon (Figure S3A), and total aconitase activity was reduced by 5\u201323% (Figure S3B) in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells. The reduction in total aconitase activity most likely reflected increased oxidative stress in the cytosol because the majority of aconitase in Huh7 cells was in cytosolic form.",

To confirm the initial observation, immunocytochemical and western blot analyses were carried out to determine the status of LC3, which is an integral part of the autophagosome membrane. LC3-positive punctuate structures in the cytoplasm were prominent in genome-length replicon and subgenomic replicon cells (Figure 3C), but they were only present at a very low level in Core-on cells. Consistent with this result, western blot analyses showed a marked increase of LC3-I and LC3-II in genome-length replicon and subgenomic replicon cells (Figure 3D). However, the ratios between LC3-I and II were not changed. In contrast to the prominent accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells, autophagosomes were not detected in HCV transgenic mice expressing the full-length HCV polyprotein (data not shown).",

Changes in total LC3 and LC3-II levels were used as indicators of autophagy. Significant reduction of total LC3 and LC3-II levels was observed in subgenomic replicon, Core-on, and Core-off cells with overexpression of CuZnSOD/cytosolic catalase (SOD1/cCAT) or MnSOD/mitochondrial catalase (SOD2/mCAT) (Figure 4A). Although similar trends were observed in Huh7 cells, the extent of reduction did not reach a significant level. Despite comparable levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, and catalase expression (Figure S4), LC3 levels were not altered in genome-length replicon cells. In contrast, X/XO treatment significantly increased total LC3 levels in genomic replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-off cells (Figure 4B, left panel). However, LC3-II levels were only significantly increased in genomic replicon and Core-off cells (Figure 4B, right panel). No significant change in LC3-II level was observed in Huh7, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells. Furthermore, addition of CAT to the X/XO treatment diminished the increase of total LC3 in genome-length and subgenomic cells (Figure 4B). The data suggest that the enhanced autophagy from X/XO treatment is mediated through H2O2 in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells.",

Significant increases in the protein levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, PRDX1, PRDX3, TRX1, and TRX2 were consistently observed in the subgenomic replicon cells, and the extent of increase ranges from 1.5- to 4.9-fold (Figure 5).

Expression of non-structural proteins also led to membrane blebbing in the ER and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. Despite these changes, only cells with the subgenomic replicon (i.e. cells expressing the non-structural proteins) showed consistent up-regulation of mitochondrial and cytosolic antioxidant enzymes. Cells with the genome-length replicon, on the other hand, did not have a robust antioxidant response and showed prolonged population doubling time and a decrease in cyclin D1 expression.

Significant core, NS5A, and NS5B distributions were observed in other subcellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and lipid droplets. The study results are in general agreement with previously published data [26]\u2013[31]. However, the inner membrane location of core protein was unexpected because previous studies using proteinase K digestion suggested association of core protein with the mitochondrial outer membrane and the mitochondrial-associated membrane compartment [15], [28]. The discrepancy could be due to the compromised mitochondrial membrane integrity in genome-length replicon and Core-on cells, or due to artifacts from sample preparations for EM analysis. The association of core protein with lipid droplets also appeared to be lower than previous study results, and the discrepancy could be due to differences in the antibodies used.",

Subgenomic replicon cells had reduced aconitase activity without a significant reduction in the protein level (Figures S3A and S3B).

            "text": "Cells respond to a variety of internal stress or cellular damages by forming autophagosomes to degrade damaged components and to recycle usable elements for future biosynthesis [33]. However, some RNA viruses, most notably, poliovirus, dengue virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus develop the abilities to overcome such cellular defense by hijacking the autophagocytic pathway to facilitate viral replication [34]\u2013[37]. Multiple studies in recent years have shown that HCV infection of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 and immortalized human hepatocytes induce autophagocytic vacuoles [38], [39] and that autophagy machinery is required for the initiation of HCV replication [40] and the production of infectious particles [41]. HCV induces the accumulation of autophagosomes via activation of the unfolded protein response pathway without enhancing autophagocytic protein degradation [38], [42]. Consequently, inhibition of autophagy inhibits HCV replication [41]. Although most studies are carried out with HCV genotype 2a, it is now well accepted that autophagy probably also occurs with infection of other HCV genotypes. What is not clear from these studies is whether enhanced autophagy persists during the chronic phase of HCV infection, and if and to what extent oxidative stress contributes to HCV-mediated activation of autophagy. In this study, we observed the accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles and up-regulation of the autophagosome marker, LC3, in the genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells (Figures 3B\u20133D). The data suggests that HCV non-structural proteins play a role in inducing autophagy, possibly through ER stress (Figure 1B), mitochondrial damage (Figures 1B and 2A), and induction of oxidative stress (Figures 2D and 4B). Core-on cells, on the other hand, had a slight increase in the number of autophagocytic vacuoles without a significant increase in LC3-II or total LC3 levels (Figures 3B-3D).",

            "text": "HCV-mediated oxidative stress was likely a contributor in the activation of autophagy because enhanced antioxidant capacity significantly reduced total LC3 and LC3-II levels (Figure 4A), whereas increased oxidative stress led to a further increase in total LC3 and LC3-II (Figure 4B). ROS generated in the cytosol and mitochondria was equally capable of enhancing autophagy because increased antioxidant capacity in either compartment achieved comparable levels of reduction. In addition, H2O2 appeared to be the main culprit in ROS-mediated activation of autophagy within this experimental system since addition of catalase effectively suppressed X/XO-mediated activation of autophagy (Figure 4B). Despite up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes in subgenomic replicon cells (Figure 5), these cells responded to further increase in antioxidant enzymes with reduced autophagy. It is important to note that although the antioxidant enzymes clearly can modulate the effects of viral proteins, they only serve to reduce the LC3 increase by \u223c26% in subgenomic replicon cells. The data suggest either that other mechanisms, such as ER stress, are important as well or that the antioxidant effect is incomplete. Overexpression of antioxidant enzymes also led to a reduction of autophagy in Core-on and Core-off cells. Antioxidant enzyme overexpression in cells with genome-length replicon, on the other hand, failed to reduce the level of autophagy even though the enhanced antioxidant capacity from SOD/CAT expression vectors was comparable to that of other cells (Figure S4). In contrast, increased oxidative stress effectively increased autophagy in genome-length replicon cells (Figure 4B). The data suggest that oxidative stress may not play a significant role in the basal level of autophagy in genome-length replicon cells; however, the cells are sensitive to additional oxidative stress and are capable of accumulating more autophagosomes under conditions of increased oxidative stress. Although total LC3 levels were increased in X/XO-treated subgenomic replicon cells, LC3-II levels were not changed with the added oxidative stress (Figure 4B). It is possible that the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was already at the maximum level in subgenomic replicon cells, and additional oxidative stress was not able to enhance the reaction further.",

Whether the NS5A localization in the autophagosome observed in our study is a cellular defense mechanism elicited to degrade foreign antigens or a viral mediated self-preserving mechanism to enable viral replication remains to be determined. HCV transgenic mice expressing the full-length HCV polyprotein were also examined for the accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles in the liver. However, no evidence of enhanced autophagy was detected. It is possible that additional factors are needed to cause the accumulation of autophagosomes in vivo or that very low viral protein expression levels in the transgenic mice were not sufficient to induce these changes. A previous study using the same line of transgenic mice [43] showed that long-term iron overload was necessary to induce the accumulation of autophagosomes. Since iron overload increases oxidative stress in the liver, the result is consistent with our finding in HCV protein-expressing cells in the relationship between oxidative stress and autophagy.",

            "text": "Huh7 cells with the subgenomic replicon showed significant up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes that belonged to the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments (Figure 5). Despite the up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes, the ratios of oxidized (Sulfonic form) to total peroxiredoxin 1 and 3 in the subgenomic replicon cells remained the same as that in Huh7 cells (Figure S5), suggesting that the overall redox environment was still more oxidizing. This conclusion was also supported by the increased MitoSOX staining and reduced aconitase activities (Figures 2C and 2D and Figure S3B). Whether the up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes in the subgenomic replicon cells is a direct response to the presence of HCV non-structural proteins or is merely a clonal variation will need to be deciphered with additional studies in the future. However, it is worth noting that previous studies with different HCV subgenomic replicon-expressing cells also showed a similar up-regulation in various antioxidant enzymes [17], [44]. Huh7 cells with the genome-length replicon had a 1.8-fold increase in the mitochondrial form of thioredoxin (TRX2), but a 15% reduction of its upstream enzyme PRDX3 (Figure 5). The net result was a slightly higher ratio of PRDX3-SO3 to total PRDX3; however, the increase was not significantly higher than that of Huh7 cells (Figure S5B). The expression level of non-structural proteins should be comparable between the genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells based on the SEAP reporter assay (Figure S1A) and published results [45]. Therefore, the lack of antioxidant response in cells with the genome-length replicon was probably not due to a difference in the expression of non-structural proteins; but rather, it could be due to the additional cytopathic effects from core, E1, E2, and p7 proteins that counteract the antioxidant enzyme response induced by non-structural proteins. Consequently, the genome-length replicon cells had a prolonged population doubling time and reduced cyclin D1 expression (Figure 6), which suggested delayed cell cycle progression. In contrast, Core-on cells showed no changes in any of the antioxidant enzymes examined.",

            "text": "In summary, our studies using Huh7 cells expressing different parts of the HCV polyprotein suggest that the presence of the full-length HCV polyprotein leads to the most severe cellular damage, including generation of ROS, accumulation of lipids, ER stress, mitochondrial injury and degeneration, accumulation of autophagosomes, and prolonged population doubling time. Despite the elevated levels of ROS, these cells failed to mount a robust antioxidant response. Huh7 cells with only the non-structural proteins, on the other hand, have the same cytopathic changes as that observed in the genome-length replicon cells, but the cells showed a robust antioxidant response even though the response was not sufficient to suppress HCV-mediated ROS production. Our data suggest that HCV-mediated ER stress, mitochondrial injury, and oxidative stress form the three arms of mediators for the activation of autophagy (Figure 7). Their effects are additive and inter-related. Without a concomitant increase in downstream protein degradation, autophagosomes accumulate and provide a sanctuary for HCV replication and protection from host immune surveillance [42]. The process likely helps to sustain a low level of viral production, which perpetuates chronic HCV infection and chronic liver injury (Figure 7). In addition to activation of autophagy, HCV-mediated ER stress can lead to imbalance in Ca homeostasis, which further contributes to cellular oxidative stress [14], [15], [46], [47]. Mitochondrial injury can lead to metabolic deficits and further exacerbates cell injury and dysfunction. Oxidative stress can cause increased DNA damage and mutation, inactivation of redox-sensitive proteins, and activation of redox sensitive signaling pathways such as MAPK and AP-1 [48]\u2013[50]. These cytopathic effects work in concert in the course of chronic HCV infection to promote cell death, hepatocyte turnover, alteration of the liver microenvironment, and ultimately cell transformation and tumorigenesis.",

All three HCV protein-expressing cell lines have been described previously [20], [26]. Genome-length replicon and subgenomic replicon were derived from a genotype 1a H77c infectious molecular clone [20]. The genome-length replicon encodes the full-length HCV polyprotein (core, E1, E2, p7, and NS2-NS5), whereas the subgenomic replicon encodes only the non-structural proteins NS2-NS5B [20]. The tet-inducible core-expressing cells express core protein in the absence of doxycycline. These cells are referred to as Core-on cells when core expression is turned on and as Core-off cells when core expression is turned off by the addition of doxycycline to the culture medium. All cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% tetracycline-free fetal calf serum (FCS, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), Pen/Strep (50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin), and G418 (200 \u00b5g/ml) plus the following antibiotics: genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells, 5 \u00b5g/ml blasticidin; Core-off cells, 20 \u00b5g/ml doxycycline. When cells were plated for an experiment, only DMEM with 10% tetracycline-free FCS and Pen/Strep was used. All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Expression of HCV proteins in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells were monitored by following the specific activities of the reporter gene, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), in the culture medium at 48 to 72 hrs after the initial plating [51]; HCV core protein expression in genome-length replicon and Core-on cells were monitored by western blot analysis.",

These cytopathic effects lead to activation of autophagy without a concomitant increase in protein degradation. Consequently, autophagosomes accumulate in HCV infected cells. EM photo with normal mitochondria (M) and rough ER (RER) was taken from healthy Huh7 cells; EM photos with enlarged mitochondria, ER blebbing, lipid droplet (L), and autophagosomes (A) were taken from genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells.
