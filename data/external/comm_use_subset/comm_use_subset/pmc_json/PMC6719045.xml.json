            "text": "The interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) genes are highly conserved between vertebrates, and their gene products fulfill diverse functions. IFITM1-3 are antiviral effector proteins of the innate immune system and block entry of several viruses into target cells [1,2,3,4]. The analysis of IFITM3 polymorphisms in human influenza patients [5], although not undisputed [6,7], as well as studies with IFITM3 knock-out mice [5,8] provided evidence that IFITM3 plays an important role in the defense against influenza virus infection. Moreover, further studies showed that IFITM3 might also contribute to innate defenses against other viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [9,10,11,12], alpha- [13,14], filo- [3,15], corona- and flaviviruses [16,17,18]. It is noteworthy that IFITMs can also be beneficial for certain viruses. Herpesviruses can use IFITMs to ensure release of progeny particles from infected cells [19], and the human coronavirus OC43 was shown to employ IFITM proteins for host cells entry [20,21]. These observations indicate that IFITM1-3 operate in pathways that can positively and negatively regulate virus infection. Therefore, understanding how IFITM proteins modulate infection might provide a basis for novel strategies for antiviral intervention.",

            "text": "IFITMs are believed to block fusion of enveloped viruses with target cells at the stage of hemifusion and/or fusion pore formation by reducing membrane fluidity or by increasing spontaneous positive curvature of the outer membrane leaflet [22,23]. Amini-Bavil-Olyaee and colleagues suggested that this might be due to IFITM-dependent alteration of intracellular cholesterol transport [24]. However, these results are not undisputed [15,22,25]. Alternatively, the particular membrane topology of IFITMs may increase positive curvature [23], and this property might be augmented by IFITM/IFITM interactions. Membrane association of IFITM proteins is facilitated by intramembrane domain 1 (IM1) [26], which is palmitoylated, and this modification is required for restriction of viruses [27,28,29]. Mutagenic analysis of IFITM3 revealed that F75 and F78 within IM1 are required for blockade of virus entry and for IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions [26], suggesting that the two processes might be linked. However, these results await confirmation, and it is incompletely understood whether mutation of these residues impacts biological properties of IFITM proteins other than self-association and inhibition of virus entry.",

IFITM proteins are localized to membranes and measurement of robust FRET-signals at the plasma membrane has been reported before [30,31,32,33]. However, negative controls used in these experiments were mainly unrelated membrane localized host-cell proteins, and the FRET-pair employed in these studies, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (eCFP)/enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), has certain disadvantages such as residual dimerization capabilities, which limit their application in FRET measurements [34]. Therefore, we first aimed to establish a set of negative controls, firmly allowing us to exclude false-positive FRET signals arising from targeting of proteins to overlapping membrane subcompartments. In addition, we based our analysis on the improved FRET pair super cyan fluorescent protein (SCFP) and super yellow fluorescent protein (SYFP) [35] to overcome limitations associated with the standard eCFP/eYFP combination.

Finally, the CAAX box at the C-terminus of RhoA was used, which is targeted to caveolae in the plasma membrane [39] due to geranyl-geranylation of a cysteine residue [40]. All SCFP and SYFP fusion proteins were efficiently expressed in transfected 293T cells and exhibited the expected molecular weights (Figure 1B, the presence of additional C-terminal amino acids derived from the polylinker region of pSYFP-C1 explains the larger size of SYFP as compared to SCFP, derived from pSCFP-N1). Expression levels were similar for all fusion proteins with the exception of SxFP-Lyn, which showed reduced expression levels (Figure 1B). The presence of membrane targeting domains resulted in pronounced membrane localization of the modified proteins relative to unmodified SCFP and SYFP (Figure 1C). Both SxFP-NM and SxFP-Lyn showed plasma membrane staining with some intracellular staining, whereas SxFP-RhoA showed a more pronounced staining of intracellular membranes with detectable staining at the plasma membrane (Figure 1C). The fusion protein SYFP-SCFP exhibited diffuse staining in the cytoplasm with strong accumulation in the nucleus, as expected [41]. ",

When SCFP and SYFP were equipped with membrane targeting signals of neuromodulin and Lyn, low FRET signals were detected, while membrane targeting via the RhoA CAAX box did not result in FRET (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, coexpression of SCFP and SYFP harboring different membrane targeting domains resulted in FRET when combinations of neuromodulin and Lyn membrane targeting signals were tested (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S2). In contrast, combinations in which one partner harbored RhoA CAAX while the other contained membrane targeting signals of neuromodulin or Lyn did not result in FRET (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S2). Thus, targeting of non-interacting, cytosolic proteins to membranes, potentially to specific membrane subcompartments, was sufficient to induce modest FRET signals in our assay. This may not be surprising, given that, for instance, certain lipid rafts can have a diameter of less than 20 nm [42]. Collectively, we were able to identify false-positive FRET signals of membrane targeted proteins in our FACS-FRET assay. These signals were modest and, based on the strong signal measured for the SCFP-SYFP fusion protein, should be markedly amplified by protein\u2013protein interactions. ",

Apart from IFITM1-3, which were all shown to display antiviral activity, we also tested IFITM5 [2,3]. As a prerequisite to these studies, all IFITM proteins were N-terminally fused to SCFP and SYFP and analyzed for expression and antiviral activity. Western blot analysis of transfected 293T cells revealed that all fusion proteins were robustly expressed, although expression of IFITM5-based fusion proteins was slightly reduced compared to that of the other IFITM proteins studied (Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained in cells engineered to stably express IFITM1-3 and the respective SCFP/SYFP fusion proteins (not shown), which were used for analysis of antiviral activity. Fusion of IFITM1-3 to fluorescent proteins was compatible with inhibition of Ebola virus glycoprotein (EBOV-GP)-driven entry, although the efficiency of inhibition by IFITM2-3-SCFP/SYFP fusion proteins was reduced compared to wild type (wt) proteins (Figure 2B). In contrast, fusion of IFITMs to fluorescent proteins largely abrogated blockade of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (FLUAV-HA)-mediated entry (Figure 2B). These results indicate different roles of the IFITM N-terminus in blockade of EBOV and FLUAV infection, although we cannot exclude that potential differences between expression of IFITM-wt and IFITM-SCFP/SYFP fusion proteins contributed to differential anti-FLUAV activity. Coexpression of IFITM1-3 and IFITM5 fused to SYFP with the identical IFITM proteins fused to SCFP resulted in robust FRET signals, and similar results were obtained for combinations of different IFITM proteins (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure S3), indicating that these proteins have a high tendency to form homo- and heterooligomers. The only exception was observed for the reverse combination of IFITM5 fused to SCFP with IFITM1-3 fused to SYFP, which yielded low FRET signals (Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure S3). While the reasons for this phenomenon are unclear at present, it could indicate a different donor/acceptor configuration, in which reduced availability of the acceptor (in this case SYFP-IFITM5) results in reduced FRET-efficiency [43]. Apart from that, all FRET signals were more robust than those observed for SCFP/SYFP artificially targeted to membranes (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S2 and data not shown), suggesting signal augmentation due to real protein\u2013protein interactions at cellular membranes.

Therefore, we next clarified whether potential differences in IFITM/IFITM interactions become detectable when low amounts of plasmids are transfected. To address this possibility, we analyzed FRET signals upon transfection of titrated amounts of plasmids (Figure 2D). The percentage of FRET-positive cells measured upon expression of the SYFP-SCFP positive control only slightly declined under those conditions and similar observations were made upon coexpression of IFITM3/IFITM3, although the number of positive cells declined from over 95% to roughly 80%. In contrast, the FRET signals measured upon coexpression of IFITM1 and IFTIM3 declined more steeply upon titration of plasmid, with roughly 20% of cells eliciting a FRET signal when the lowest amount of plasmid was transfected. These observations are in keeping with known differences in cellular localization of IFITM1 (mainly plasma membrane) and IFITM3 (mainly endo-/lysosomal compartments) [44,45] and suggest that subtle differences in membrane localization and/or interactions between IFITM proteins can be more readily visualized when low amounts of plasmids are transfected. Furthermore, the data indicate that IFITM3 is more likely to form homooligomers than heterooligomers with IFITM1.",

In contrast, the mutation of both phenylalanines did not alter colocalization of the mutant with IFITM3-wt in transfected HeLa cells (Figure 3C), as determined by analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient (a measure for colocalization, Figure 3D). Similarly, double mutation of F75 and F78 in IFITM3 did not reduce FRET signals with coexpressed IFITM3-wt or IFITM3-FF (Figure 3E), suggesting that F75 and F78 are dispensable for appropriate localization of IFITM3 to and within membranes and for IFITM/IFITM interactions.

To address this concern, we first analyzed whether differences in FRET upon coexpression of IFITM3-wt/IFITM3-wt and IFITM3-wt/IFITM3-FF could be detected when the amounts of transfected plasmids were reduced as described above. However, no appreciable differences were observed (not shown). We next characterized an IFITM3 mutant, IFITM3-43AS, known to exhibit a different cellular localization as compared to IFITM3-wt [26]. In this mutant, amino acids 43\u201348 are changed to alanines, and this change was found to be compatible with robust expression but not with full antiviral activity [26]. Western blot analysis revealed that IFITM3-43AS fused to SCFP or SYFP was expressed with the same efficiency as the corresponding IFITM3-wt fusion proteins (not shown), as expected. Coexpression of IFITM3-43AS with IFITM3-wt reduced FRET relative to coexpression of IFITM3-wt or IFITM3-43AS proteins alone, but the signals detected remained above background (Figure 3E, Supplementary Figure S4). These results are compatible with the observation that substitution of amino acids 43\u201348 by alanine residues changes the cellular localization of IFTIM3 and hence the interaction with IFITM3 [26]. Moreover, they suggest that these substitutions may have only modest effects on IFITM3-43AS/IFITM3-43AS interactions. Finally, our findings suggest that the FACS-FRET assay employed in the present study can detect alterations of IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions resulting from altered membrane localization of the interactions partners.",

Because F75 and F78 were previously proposed to alter the self-interaction of IFITM3 [26], we sought to corroborate this result by an independent experimental approach, coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 4). For this, IFITM3-wt and IFITM3-FF were equipped with a triple FLAG antigenic tag, controlled for comparable expression (not shown) and coexpressed with the same proteins harboring a myc tag. Mutant IFITM-43AS was included for comparison. Expression of untagged IFITM3-wt instead of IFTIM3-wt with FLAG tag served as negative control. Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and subsequent Western blot with anti-myc antibody revealed that IFITM3-wt proteins interacted and that this interaction was not perturbed by substitution of amino acids 43\u201348 with alanine residues. Again, this finding was in-line with the FRET results, showing that FRET signals of IFITM3 with IFITM3-43AS are reduced but not fully disrupted (Figure 4), indicating that both proteins can still interact in membrane microdomains. F75 and F78 were also dispensable for interactions with IFITM3-wt and IFITM-FF, which contrasts with published data [26] but is in keeping with the FRET analysis discussed above. In summary, our results indicate that F75 and F78 are neither required for adequate membrane targeting of IFITM3 nor for IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions.",

We provide evidence for interactions between IFITM1-3 and 5, and we show that IFITM3-wt and IFITM3 with mutated F75 and F78 induce robust FRET signals and physically interact, indicating that F75 and F78 are dispensable for adequate membrane localization and IFITM3-IFITM3 interactions.",

            "text": "We first asked whether FRET signals in our assay depend on protein\u2013protein interactions or whether targeting of two non-interacting proteins to membranes can be sufficient for FRET. The latter was the case: SCFP and SYFP did not elicit FRET signals when expressed in the cytosol while FRET was observed when both proteins were targeted to the plasma membrane. This observation raised the question whether membrane targeting alone was sufficient for FRET or whether targeting to membrane subdomains was required. SYFP and SCFP equipped with a geranylgeranylation-dependent membrane targeting signal did not elicit FRET, despite robust expression and membrane localization. These findings suggest that membrane localization alone was not sufficient for FRET in the assay employed. Finally, it should be noted that FRET signals measured upon membrane targeting of SCFP and SYFP were modest while robust signals were measured for SCFP and SYFP fused to IFITM3-wt, a membrane targeted protein known to form homotypic interactions [26,47]. Collectively, FRET signals solely due to localization of proteins in the same membrane subdomain were detectable but low while high signals were measured upon protein\u2013protein interactions of membrane proteins. IFITM proteins inhibit host cell entry of several enveloped viruses and are believed to exert their antiviral activity by altering membrane fluidity and/or curvature [22,23]. This might require the formation of IFITM multimers due to IFITM-IFITM interactions, and a previous study indeed showed homotypic interactions between IFITM proteins [26]. The present results are in agreement with these findings and provide evidence that also IFITM5 proteins may self-interact and interact with other IFITM paralogues. Why the FRET signals measured upon IFITM5 coexpression with IFITM1\u20133 were asymmetric, i.e., dependent on whether IFITM5 was donor or acceptor, is at present unclear, and differences in donor/acceptor configuration might be responsible, as stated above. Alternatively, the results may point towards differences in the heterotypic interactions between IFITM1\u20133 and IFITM5/IFITM1\u20133.",

In particular, the double mutation of F75 and F78 strongly reduced antiviral activity and this phenotype was associated with lack of IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions [26]. Our results confirm the loss of antiviral activity since F75 and F78 were required for blockade of both EBOV-GP- and FLUAV-HA-mediated entry. The lack of antiviral activity of IFITM3 with mutated F75 and F78 might stem from altered membrane localization of the mutant relative to the wt protein or could be due to abrogated IFITM3/IFITM3 interactions, as previously suggested [26]. The present study suggests that the membrane localization of IFITM3-wt and IFITM3-FF was not substantially different, since FRET signals in cells coexpressing IFITM3-wt/IFITM3-wt or IFITM3-wt/IFITM3-FF mutant were comparable. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation showed that mutation of phenylalanine 75 and 78 was compatible with robust interactions with IFITM3-wt and IFITM3-FF. These results are not in keeping with previously published data [26], potentially due to differences in expression levels and conditions used for coimmunoprecipitation. ",

For generation of retroviral vectors encoding SxFP-IFITM fusion proteins, the SCFP3A-IFITM1 or SYFP2-IFITM1 coding sequences were amplified with primers EIF3-5Esp and SV40pAseq digested with Esp3I and EcoRI and cloned into pQCXIP-mcs cut with NotI and EcoRI. Finally, NotI/EcoRI fragments encoding IFITM2 and 3 sequences were used to replace IFITM1 to generate pQCXIP encoding the respective SxFP-IFITM2 and 3 fusion proteins [15]. Plasmid encoding IFITM3 mutant 43AS was obtained from Abraham Brass (pQCXIP-IFITM3 43-48 AS). The IFITM3-FF mutant was generated by overlap-extension PCR using pCAGGS-IFITM3 [51] as template and primer pairs IFITM3-5N/mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-rev and mut-IFITM3-F75AF78A-for/pCAGGS-3\u2032 to amplify parts of the IFITM3 gene. The PCR product was cloned into pQCXIP using NotI and EcoRI. Subsequently, IFITM3-43AS and IFITM3-FF were subcloned as NotI/EcoRI fragments into pSCFP3A-IFITM1 or pSYFP2-IFITM1 thus replacing the IFITM1 genes. To generate pcDNA3-myc1-IFITM3, the IFITM3 gene was subcloned as Acc65I and EcoRI fragment from pCAGGS-IFITM3 into pcDNA3-myc1, which contains start codon and myc-epitope coding sequences inserted into HindIII and Acc65I sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Flag tagged IFITM3 was generated by splice overlap PCR using HCMVep-seq and FLAG-IFrev primers and pCMV-3xFLAG-SNX5 [52] template as well as template pCAGGS-IFITM3 and primers FLAG-IFfor and pCAGGS-3\u2032 and cloned into pcDNA3 via HindIII and EcoRI. Mutant genes IFITM3-43AS and IFITM3-FF were inserted into pcDNA3-myc1 and pcDNA3-3xFLAG as Acc65I and BamHI sites fragments from the respective pQCXIP-plasmids.
