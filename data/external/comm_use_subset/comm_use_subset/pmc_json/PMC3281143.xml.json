            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. HCV has been recognized as a major cause of chronic liver disease and affects approximately 200 million people worldwide at the present time. Persistent infection is associated with the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A protective vaccine for HCV is not yet available and even the most recent combination of antiviral therapy is often poorly tolerated [1]. The HCV genome encodes one large open reading frame that is translated as a polyprotein which is proteolytically processed to yield the viral structural and nonstructural (NS) proteins. The non-structural proteins include the p7 ion channel, the NS2-3 protease, the NS3 serine protease/RNA helicase and its co-factor NS4A, the NS4B and NS5A proteins and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [2], [3]. Two virally encoded proteases participate in polyprotein processing, the NS2-3 autoprotease (which cleaves in cis at the NS2-3 junction) and the NS3-4A serine protease (which cleaves at four downstream NS protein junctions). NS3 is an extensively studied HCV protein that possesses multiple enzymatic activities that are essential for HCV replication, making NS3-4A the most attractive target for anti HCV drug development [4]. The N-terminus of NS3, in complex with its endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-anchored co-factor NS4A, primarily functions as a serine protease, which cleaves the viral polyprotein precursor downstream to NS3. The remaining 2/3 of the protein has a helicase and NTPase activities, both of which are essential for HCV replication [5].",

These agents, which we named \u201czymoxins\u201d (for \u201czymogenized toxins\u201d), were composed of a fusion between the binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and NS3-activable modified catalytic domains of the bacterial or the plant toxins diphtheria toxin (DTA) or ricin toxin (RTA), respectively. Upon binding and translocation into cells cytoplasm by virtue of the corresponding Pseudomonas exotoxin A domains, activation of these toxins is mediated by HCV-NS3 protease cleavage that separates between the toxic domains and a fused, rationally designed inhibitory peptide. These zymoxins showed a higher level of cytotoxicity when applied to NS3 expressing cells or to HCV infected cells, demonstrating a potential therapeutic window. Still, the zymoxins we described had two limitations: first, they required high levels of NS3 protease for efficient activation, and second, they were not totally inactive in the zymogenized state, and their basal cytotoxic activity without proteolytic activation resulted in quite narrow therapeutic windows [10]. Apparently, the zymoxins were only partially inhibited by the rationally designed inhibitory peptides.",

            "text": "Toxic proteins that are completely inhibited by a natural inhibitor can be found in bacterial \u201ctoxin-antitoxin\u201d systems. Natural bacterial plasmids ensure their survival within the bacterial host by replicating inside their host cell and using mechanisms that function to segregate them prior to cell division [11]. In addition, several low copy number plasmids use a unique system called \u201caddiction module\u201d or \u201ctoxin-antitoxin (TA) system\u201d which functions to prevent the proliferation of plasmid-free cells by executing the so called \u201cpost-segregational killing effect\u201d. The system consists of a pair of genes encoding for a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin organized in a bicistronic operon that is transcriptionally autoregulated either by the toxin-antitoxin complex itself or by the antitoxin alone. When coexpressed in plasmid harboring cells, the antitoxin component interferes with the lethal action of the toxin. If a cell loses the plasmid, the cellular concentration of the labile antitoxin (that is degraded faster than the more stable toxin) is rapidly diminished, enabling the toxin to exert its action which eventually results in cell death (reviewed by [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]). Toxin-antitoxin systems have also been found integrated to the chromosome of various bacteria species where their function has been the subject of considerable speculation [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. One of the most studied \u201cgenomic\u201d TA modules was found on the chromosome of E. coli as a negatively autoregulated bicistronic operon. The system, which is activated by several stress conditions, was denoted MazEF after its two active protein components: the long lived MazF toxin and the labile MazE antitoxin. MazF induced toxicity is executed by blocking de-novo protein synthesis through its endoribonuclease activity that catalyze the cleavage of single-stranded mRNAs at ACA sequences [22]. When coexpressed with MazF, the MazE antitoxin complexed with the toxin and a catalytically inactive heterohexamer is formed in which a MazE dimer is sandwiched between two MazF dimers (MazF2-MazE2-MazF2) (reviewed by [21], [23]). The crystal structure of the MazE-MazF complex indicates that the interactions between the toxin and the antitoxin are primarily mediated by the acidic C terminus of MazE which wraps around the MazF homodimer crossing the edge of the dimer interface [24]. Later on, Li et al had discovered that a short acidic peptide corresponding to MazE C-terminal 23 amino-acids, which they denoted \u201cMazEp\u201d, binds strongly to the homodimer of MazF which possesses two identical active sites. Interestingly, it was found that one inhibitory peptide, occupying a single active site on the MazF homodimer, affects the conformation of both sites that consequently become catalytically inactive. This unique mechanism also explains the inhibitory activity of MazE toward MazF at a 1\u22362 molar ratio [25]. The discovery of the MazF mechanism of action was soon followed by demonstrations that it is also toxic to eukaryotic cells, causing Bak-dependent programmed cell death in mammalian cells, suggesting it may be used as a tool for gene therapy against diseases such as cancer and AIDS [26], [27].",

We show that the self-inhibited, zymogenized toxin is well tolerated when expressed in na\u00efve cells. In contrast, in NS3 expressing or in HCV infected cells, NS3-mediated cleavage separates between the toxin and its inhibitor which results in inhibition of protein synthesis followed by death of the cells.

            "text": "For the construction of NS3-activated MazF based zymoxin, the MazF coding sequence was fused through its C terminus to the HCV P10-P10' NS3 cleavage sequence derived from the 2a genotype (strain JFH1) NS5A/B junction. A short inhibitory peptide corresponding to MazE C-terminal 35 amino-acids (which encompass the 23 amino-acids inhibitory peptide (MazEp) that has been described by Li et al.\n[25]) was fused, preceded by a short flexible linker, to the C terminus of the MazF-NS3 cleavage site sequence. A flexible linker, followed by the C-terminal ER membrane anchor of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B [28], was than fused to the C terminus of the inhibitory peptide and the whole construct was fused through its N terminus to the monomeric red fluorescence protein mCherry [29] (see \n\nFigure 1\n). The rationale behind the design of this construct, which was denoted \u201cmCherry-NS3 activated MazF\u201d, was that the coupling between the ribonuclease and its antidote may enable high level of expression of the non-toxic fusion on the ER membrane of uninfected mammalian cells without causing any deleterious effect. In contrast, in HCV infected cells, the fusion protein is expected to colocalize with the ER membrane-bound viral NS3 protease (in infected cells, NS3 is localized to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane and membranes of ER-like modified compartments [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]). As a result, the NS3-cleavable linker between the toxin and its inhibitory peptide is expected to be cleaved. The toxic ribonuclease, no longer covalently tethered to its ER membrane-anchored inhibitor, is now free to diffuse into the cytoplasm (which lacks the antidote) and exert its cytotoxic activity. Finally, fusion to the fluorescent protein mCherry makes the whole construct trackable and facilitates the determination of its expression level and intracellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. As a control, an uncleavable construct (denoted \u201cmCherry-uncleavable MazF\u201d) was constructed in which the NS3 cleavage sequence was replaced by a mutated 14 amino acids cleavage sequence (P10-P4') from HCV genotype 1a NS5A/B junction in which the P3 valine was substituted by alanine, the P2 cysteine by glycine, the P1 cysteine by glycine and the P4' tyrosine by alanine. A schematic representation of the NS3-activated MazF-based zymoxin (\u201cmCherry-NS3 activated MazF\u201d) and the hypothetical mechanism of its cleavage by NS3 protease on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane are shown in \nFigure 1\n. The amino-acid sequence of the MazF based zymoxins can be found in Text S1.",

HEK293 T-REx cells where transfected with plasmids encoding either mCherry-NS3 activated MazF, mCherry (only the fluorescent protein) or EGFP- MazF (where MazF is not fused to its inhibitory peptide). 48 hours (h) later, expression of the encoded transgenes was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (data not shown) and transfected cells were seeded in 3 fold dilutions and were treated with G418 (to which all three plasmids confer resistance).

Presumably, this proteolytic activation of the ribonuclease toxin resulted in a cessation of cellular protein synthesis soon after induction, what explains the detection of relatively low levels of NS3 protease in these cells. As expected, no zymoxin cleavage could be detected in cells expressing the uncleavable form of the toxin. A faint band, corresponding to a cleaved zymoxin, can also be detected in uninduced cells that express the NS3 cleavable construct. This cleavage can be attributed to the \u201cleakiness\u201d of the Tet inducible system, allowing a very low basal transcription of the protease in the absence of externally added tetracycline. Such cleavage could not be detected in \u201cna\u00efve\u201d cells following transfection with NS3-cleavage substrate encoding transgene ([10], data not shown).

After 72 h, the relative fraction of viable cells was determined using an enzymatic MTT assay. As shown in \nFigure 5\n\n(lower panel), the expression level of NS3 can be roughly tuned by modulation of the final tetracycline concentration in the growth media, with around 10 ng/ml as an intermediate concentration for induction of low NS3 expression level. Indeed, strong cytotoxicity was clearly evident when Tet-NS3/activated MazF cells where treated with tetracycline concentrations of down to 4 ng/ml. No cytotoxic effect was detected when the controls Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF or Tet-inducible full NS3-4A (protease only) expressing cells were similarly treated (\nFigure 5\n\n, upper panel). These findings demonstrate the deleterious effect of the MazF based zymoxin specifically toward NS3 protease expressing cells, as well as its competence to be activated by very low cellular levels of protease. In order to obtain a visual insight at the cell level, Tet-NS3/activated MazF and Tet-NS3/uncleavable MazF cells were supplemented with tetracycline to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml or 1000 ng/ml (for low and high induction levels of NS3 expression, respectively), or left untreated. 36 h later, nuclei were stained and cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope. The results show that both lower and higher induction levels of NS3 protease caused growth inhibition and rounding of cells that constitutively expresses the cleavable MazF. Furthermore, both green and red fluorescence were faint in these cells, probably as a result of the destructive ribonuclease activity of the cleaved toxin toward the NS3 protease and its own mRNA. As expected, none of the above observations was evident when these cells were not supplemented with tetracycline or when NS3 expression was induced to high level in cells that constitutively express the uncleavable toxin (\nFigure 6\n).",

This is one of the currently used models to study hepatitis C virus in which recombinant infectious HCV particles are produced in cell culture (HCVcc) (for review, see [41], [42]). As the main purpose of zymoxins based treatment is the specific eradication of HCV infected cells from a background of healthy cells, \u201cmixed culture\u201d experiments were carried out. In these experiments, Huh7.5 hepatoma cells were infected with the HCV 1a/2a chimeric virus HJ3-5 (encoding the NS3 protease of genotype 2a strain JFH1 [40]). When infection reached \u223c50% (about 50% of the cultured cells showed expression of the HCV-core protein, as detected by immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy), the mixed culture and a culture of uninfected cells were treated with NS3 activated MazF or uncleavable-MazF encoding adenoviruses at MOI of \u223c3. Control cells remained untreated. 72 h post adenoviral infection; viability assay and microscopic examination that included immunostaining for HCV-core protein were performed. As shown, treating the mixed culture with NS3-activated MazF zymoxin-encoding adenovirus reduced the viable cells population to about 65% relatively to untreated control; while viability of the uninfected cells (\u201cHCV negative\u201d) was barely affected by this treatment (\nFigure 8\n\n, upper panel). Microscopic examination of the treated mixed culture revealed two cell populations that differ in their appearance. While one population is characterized by a \u201ctypical\u201d Huh7.5 cell morphology (hollow arrows, \nFigure 8\n\n, lower panel), the other is composed of partially detached cells with round, condensed or distorted shape (filled arrows) that are hypothesized to be zymoxin-intoxicated HCV infected cells. In order to validate this assumption, the fraction of HCV infected cells from the general population was evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-HCV core protein specific antibodies. Indeed, treatment with the NS3-activated zymoxin showed a \u201ccuring effect\u201d upon the partially infected culture, considerably reducing the fraction of the HCV infected cells from the general population (\nFigure 9\n). As expected, no significant effect upon the HCV infected cell population was observed following treatment with the uncleavable zymoxin.",

Following the introduction of the sitoxin into the target cell (that expresses the specific protease), cleavage by the predetermined protease separates the toxic effector domain of the sitoxin from the intracellular signaling moiety, resulting either in a longer-lived (and therefore more toxic) effector domain or in an effector domain that moves from a cellular compartment where the domain is nontoxic to a cellular compartment where the domain is able to exert its effect [51]. We developed and successfully evaluated two rationally designed viral-protease-activated chimeric toxins which we named \u201czymoxins\u201d for \u201czymogenized toxins\u201d [10]. In contrast to sitoxins, in which the inhibitory activity is mediated by intracellular components which recognize a cleavable signaling polypeptide fused to a constitutively active toxin; the concept of zymoxins is based on the idea of reengineering a toxic enzyme into an inactive zymogen which is specifically activated by a predetermined protease. This general approach was demonstrated by other elegant studies in which several enzymes, including bovine RNase A, Vip2 and the maize ribosome inactivating protein (maize-RIP) were converted into protease activated forms [53], [54], [55], [56], [57].",

In order to convert MazF into a zymoxin, a fusion polypeptide was constructed in which an inhibitory peptide derived from the MazE antitoxin was fused to the C terminus of the MazF toxin via an NS3-cleavable linker. Regarding the issue of incomplete inhibition of zymoxin's activity in uncleaved form, it should be mentioned that in contrast to our previously described constructs, in which a \u201crationally designed\u201d peptide is appended to provide the inhibition of the toxin's activity; in the MazF based-zymoxin, a \u201cnatural\u201d inhibitory polypeptide was chosen for that purpose. Antidote polypeptides in toxin-antitoxin systems were \u201cevolutionary shaped\u201d to strongly inhibit the destructive activity of their toxic counterparts. Thus, a very efficient inhibition may be achieved when using them as inhibitory peptides in the construction of zymoxins.

This property may, in fact, contribute to the specificity and general safety of zymoxin-based therapeutics, even though \u201cspontaneous\u201d, unspecific proteolytic activity toward NS3 substrates could not be detected in na\u00efve cells during our experiments (data not shown). As discussed, tethering the zymoxin to the ER membrane through its inhibitory peptide may also enhance its cleavage-dependent toxicity. This might be achieved by enabling spatial separation between the activated toxin and its antidote following NS3-cleavage and diffusion of the active MazF to the inhibitory peptide-free cytoplasm. Supporting this assumption, we found that although cleaved, a cytoplasmic version of the NS3-activated MazF based zymoxin is barely toxic to NS3 protease-expressing cells (data not shown).",

For example, when overexpressed in non-infected cells, an NS3-cleavable apoptotic molecule, such as that described above, may act as a \u201cdominant negative\u201d by competing with the natural, endogenous protein for interactions with activators, regulators or substrates. Delivery of a transgene encoding for a foreign protein which has no endogenous counterpart in target cells, such as MazF, may reduce that risk. Furthermore, it should be noted that MazF possess a ribonuclease activity that is also capable of processing multiple potential cleavage sites in the HCV genome. Although not evaluated in this study, a direct attack on the parasite's genetic material may represent an additional mode of anti-viral activity that works in parallel with host-cell protein synthesis shutoff.",

The MazF-based zymoxin, that is introduced to target cells by means of adenovirus mediated gene delivery, shows very low toxicity to na\u00efve cells and enhanced responsiveness to low viral-protease expression level, when compared to our previously presented constructs. As evident from our results, the MazF based zymoxin eradicates NS3-expressing model cells and HCV infected cells with remarkable efficiency and specificity, providing further proof to the concept of zymoxins and a potential new means of fighting viral diseases. Obviously, further optimizations and pharmacological assessments in animal models may be required in order to determine the safety and efficiency of zymoxins treatment in the context of the whole organism.",

In brief, 10 \u00b5g of in vitro-synthesized HCV RNA was mixed with 5\u00d7106 Huh7.5 cells in a 2-mm cuvette and pulsed twice at 1.4 kV and 25 \u00b5F. Cells were seeded into 12-well plates or 25-cm2 flasks, and passaged at 3-to 4-day intervals posttransfection by trypsinization and reseeding with a 1\u22363 to 1\u22364 split into fresh culture vessels. When infectivity reached \u223c50%, as was monitored by immunofluorescent staining with anti HCV core protein mouse monoclonal antibody (Affinity BioReagents, USA) and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, USA) (see \u201cvisualizing HCV infected cells (infectivity assay)\u201d below), the mixed culture (of uninfected and HCV infected cells in 1\u22361 ratio) was taken for cytotoxicity assays.",
