            "text": "Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious fatal viral disease affecting most species of birds, which was classified as a list A infectious disease by the World Organization for Animal Health. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as the etiological agent for ND is a nonsegmented single-stranded negative sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Avulavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family [1]. NDV is endemic to many countries, most notably in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility, and has caused tremendous economic consequences to the poultry industry throughout the world. NDV virion contains at least six structural proteins, Haemagglutinin Neuraminidase (HN), Fusion protein (F), Matrix protein (M), Nucleocapsid protein (NP), Phosphate protein (P) and Large protein (L) [2-5]. HN and F are the two surface glycoproteins of viral envelope membrane, whereas NP\u3001P\u3001L and membrane-associated M are inner components of NDV virions [2-5]. F protein, which is considered to be the key virulence determinant of the virus, mediates the fusion process between viruses and cell membranes [6-8]. HN is a multifunctional virion protein, which plays roles in helping membrane fusion, cell tropism determination and viral pathogenicity [9-11]. M lies beneath the viral membrane and surrounds the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex [12]. The RNP complex consists of the viral RNA coated with NP and bound by the polymerase complex that contains P and L [13].",

Numerous host proteins have been found that incorporate into the membranes or inside the envelopes of the virions using virion proteomic approaches. Herpes virus, an enveloped DNA virus which is a leading cause of human viral diseases, is currently the best studied virus group. Among this group are human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [17], murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) [18], Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [19], Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) [20,21], rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) [22], Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV) [23] and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) [24]. Moreover, virion proteomics have been performed for other enveloped DNA viruses, such as vaccinia virus (VV) [25,26], gigantic mimivirus [27], White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) [28,29] and Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) [30].",

Our virion proteomics identified 9 host cytoskeleton system proteins in purified NDV particles, which were the most abundant group of cellular proteins, including Tropomyosin 1 alpha, actin, actin -related protein 3 ARP3, tubulin alpha-1, annexin A2, ezrin, CAP-GLY domain containing linker protein 2, capping protein (Actin filament) muscle Z-line and KIAA0174. Numerous viral proteins interact with cytoskeleton elements. Available evidences indicate that host cytoplasm cytoskeleton components are involved in virus transport in cells, especially in the stages of virus entry and release [45]. Several studies have also indicated that cytoskeleton proteins such as Tubulin and Actin are required for viral gene expression [46,47] and are involved in several virus budding processes [48]. Interestingly, actin was originally thought as a cellular contaminant, but later demonstrated to be an internal component of the measles virus [49,50]. In a number of viruses, such as HIV and moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV), actin is important during their budding [51-53]. For influenza virus, actin plays indispensable roles during the endocytosis of the virus into polarized epithelia [54]. An association of M with cytoskeleton elements has been reported [55], which indicates an essential function of actin in the replication cycle of coronavirus IBV. As for NDV, early studies have suggested that the cellular cytoskeletal framework actively participated in the structural and functional assembly of NDV transcriptive complex [56]. Therefore, cytoplasm cytoskeleton-associated proteins might take part in the assembly and budding process of newly formed NDV virions, contribute to the transportation of the virus to the correct location of host cell, and also participate in assembling the RNP complex.",

            "text": "Heat-shock proteins (HSP), known as molecular chaperones, has been identified in a number of envelope viruses. Several viruses require host molecular chaperones for entry, replication, and assembly, as well as other steps in viral production [63,64]. In this study, we identified two molecular chaperones incorporated into purified NDV particles, HSP70 and HSP90. HSP70 interacts with various viral proteins and may be involved in the assembly of adenovirus [41], enterovirus [42], vaccinia virus [43] and hantaan virus [44]. Virion-associated HSP70 might participate in early events of infection, uncoating the viral capsid in a manner similar to its role in the uncoating of clathrin cages[65]. HSP70 and HSP90 have been shown to interact with hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase and to facilitate the initiation of viral DNA synthesis from hepatitis B virus pregenomic RNA [66,67]. HSP90, which can cooperate with other proteins such as p23 and HSP70, has 2\u20134 copies existing internally in a duck liver virus particle, and might be related to interaction between virus polymerase [68]. Besides, it has been proposed that HSP90 is a major host factor for viral replication of many RNA viruses [69], implying a important role of HSP90 in NDV replication.",

The critical challenge of virion proteomics was to prove that the host proteins were really an integral part of the virions and are not just non-specifically attached to the outside of the virions or derived from the contaminants. To address this question, we performed control experiment. Extracts from 13-day-old SPF embryonated eggs were designed as a positive control; AF from 13-day-old SPF embryonated eggs performed with the same protocol as the purification of NDV virions was used as a negative control.",

The viral protein samples were then separated at 120 V on linear 5%-15% SDS-PAGE with 5% stacking gels in Tris: glycine buffer for about 3 h. After separated by SDS-PAGE, the viral proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVDF, P/N 66485, BioTrace, Pall Corporation). The membrane was blocked in freshly prepared 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 0.05% Tween-20 for 2 h at RT with constant agitation. The PVDF membrane was washed three times with Tris buffered saline buffer (TBS) plus 0.2% Tween-20 and incubated with properly diluted primary antibodies for 2 h at RT.
