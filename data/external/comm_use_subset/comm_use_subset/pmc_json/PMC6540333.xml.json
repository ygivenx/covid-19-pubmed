IBV can infect the respiratory and urogenital systems in growing chickens, causing high mortality, slowing down growth, and reducing egg production in the flock [1]. Therefore, IBV may result in a considerable economic loss in the global poultry industry. In Taiwan, IBV first appeared in 1958, and the disease has occurred frequently, although an IBV vaccination program has long been implemented [2]. IBV strains in Taiwan include two genotypes, namely Taiwan Group I (TW-I) and Taiwan Group II (TW-II), which are prominent because of their capacity to cause nephritis and respiratory symptoms in chickens [3,4]. Because of its frequent gene mutations and recombination events, IBV variants in different serotypes have been isolated from the field constantly [5]. Due to serotype differences in Taiwan, extensive use of commercially available Massachusetts (Mass) serotype vaccines did not effectively prevent IBV outbreaks in chicken flocks [2].",

The S glycoprotein is believed to be related to the host range, and it can be post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits [6]. The S1 protein is highly variable and is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies [7,8]. Moreover, the N protein is a relatively conserved structural protein that reveals high identity among various strains [9], and its highly immunogenic nature can induce antibodies as well as the T-cell mediated immunity in chickens [10]. Therefore, the S and N proteins, in parallel development, are widely used as antigen targets for IBV detection [11,12].",

Moreover, mAbs specific to Taiwan IBV strains have been used in a serum blocking ELISA, providing a simple and rapid method for detecting the wild-type IBV infection [16]. In addition, nucleic acid tests such as RT-PCR and other modifications of ELISA have been commonly used to identify strains of IBV in the field [4,17,18,19,20].

ICSs are widely designed for use at point-of-care as they provide cheap, simple and rapid tests desirable in many industries [23,24,25,26].

Different concentrations of mAbs were added to each colloidal gold solution. Each point represented the absorbance at OD 580 nm after an additional 10% NaCl was added. The lower OD of the mAb-gold conjugate indicates the dispersed gold nanoparticle distribution in the solution as small particles have higher light transmittance, thereby indicating that the antibodies sufficiently stabilize the gold nanoparticles in the given pH environment. As indicated in Figure 2A, the lowest OD value corresponded with a mAb concentration of 15 \u03bcg/mL and a colloidal gold solution at pH 8. After the tracer was prepared, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunogold staining were performed to examine the binding of the mAb with gold nanoparticles.

Various samples of avian respiratory pathogens, including the AF (105.5 EID50) of AIV, NDV, ILTV and IBV, were used to test the specificity of the assembled ICS. The test line was found to respond to IBV only but not to other respiratory diseases\u2019 antigens (Figure 4A). The ICS indicated high specificity in IBV antigen detection. In addition, the cross-reactive detection against different strains of the IBV provided by this ICS test was evaluated. Results demonstrated that the ICS was capable of detecting numerous IBV genotypes, including TW-I, TW-II, Mass, and the TW-China variant, but not the non-infectious AF (Figure 4B). Morover, the detection limit against the IBVs was evaluated. As indicated in Table 1, IBV 2575/98 (TW-I) exhibited the best detection limit at 104.4 EID50, followed by H120 (Mass type) at 104.6 EID50, 2992/02 (TW-CN variant) at 104.8 EID50 and IBV 2296/95 (TW-II) at 104.8 EID50.",

Therefore, the rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease facilitates disease management. Avian infectious bronchitis has posed a threat in the poultry industry worldwide.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IBV antigen detection by using an ICS. The results of comparing the reference RT-PCR test with our ICS implied that the ICS could detect antigens as early as 1 dpi from throat swab samples and 5 dpi from cloacal swab samples. The detection limit of the ICS strip was approximately 104.5 to 104.8 EID50. The results of our study were slightly better than those reported for the liquid-phase blocking ELISA in Lougovskaia et al. [28] with the detection limit of the H120 strain reported to be 105.8 EID50. The nature of mAbs developed in this study is specific to the IBV among avian respiratory pathogens. Furthermore, by employing broadly-reactive mAbs of IBV, this described ICS displayed cross-reactivity against multiple types of IBVs, including two local Taiwan genotypes, recombinant variants, and the Mass type strain. Additional studies should be taken to ensure an antigen\u2013antibody reaction against some other common strains worldwide; for example, Arkansas, Conn, JMK or QX-IBV.",

A positive IBV TW-I type AF was used as an antigen, and SPF AF was used as a negative control to determine the detection capacity of each combination. It was found that the use of mAb LK-10a and LK2-13a in the ICS generated non-specific signals and thus was ruled out as an option. In the preparation of the tracer, the stability of the mAb-gold conjugate is critical for optimizing the ICS strip\u2019s performance. In this study, an mAb concentration of 15 \u03bcg/mL with colloidal gold solution at pH 8 exhibited the most stable condition in coagulation curves.

The final extension stage was performed at a temperature of 72 \u00b0C for 12 min and then maintained at 4 \u00b0C. PCR products were analyzed through the agarose gel electrophoresis.",
