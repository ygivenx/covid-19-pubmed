            "text": "The family Potyviridae encompasses around 30% of known plant virus species and causes more than half of viral crop damage worldwide 1,2. The family comprises the genera Potyvirus, Rymovirus, Bymovirus, Ipomovirus, Tritimovirus, Macluravirus, Poacevirus and Brambyvirus, with genus Potyvirus containing the most species. Family members have single-stranded monopartite positive-sense RNA genomes except in the genus Bymovirus where the genome is bipartite. The genomic RNA has a covalently linked 5\u2032-terminal protein (VPg) and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. Subgenomic transcripts are not produced 3. Until recently, all the viral proteins were thought to be encoded within a single open reading frame (ORF) (or one ORF per segment in bymoviruses) that is translated as a polyprotein and cleaved to produce the mature virus proteins. However, it is now thought that all potyvirids contain an additional coding ORF, termed pipo, that overlaps the P3-encoding region of the polyprotein ORF in the \u22121/+2 reading frame (Fig1) 4. PIPO is expressed as part of a larger product that was hypothesized to comprise the N-terminal part of P3 (termed P3N) fused to PIPO via either translational or transcriptional frameshifting 4. This hypothesis was further supported by the detection of products of appropriate sizes for P3 and P3N-PIPO with antibodies to N-terminal epitopes in P3 5,6. Frameshifting was proposed to occur at a GAA_AAA_A sequence (underscores separate polyprotein-frame codons) at the 5\u2032 end of the pipo ORF that is highly conserved among Potyvirus species (Fig1). Members of other Potyviridae genera have similar homopolymeric runs of \u201cA\u201ds at the same site (Appendix Dataset S1). The frameshift product P3N-PIPO plays an essential role in cell-to-cell movement, and mutations within this motif result in a movement-deficient phenotype 5-7,8,9.",

            "text": "Many viruses utilize programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) to direct a proportion of ribosomes into an alternative reading frame. In eukaryotic systems, efficient \u22121 PRF normally requires a \u201cslippery\u201d heptanucleotide sequence where the shift in reading frame takes place, and a 3\u2032-adjacent stimulatory element which normally comprises an RNA stem-loop or pseudoknot structure separated from the slippery heptanucleotide by a \u201cspacer\u201d region of 5\u20139 nt 10,11. The consensus motif for the slippery heptanucleotide is X_XXY_YYZ, where XXX normally represents any three identical nucleotides; YYY represents AAA or UUU; Z represents A, C or U; and spaces separate zero-frame codons 12. In the tandem slippage model, the P-site anticodon re-pairs from XXY to XXX, whereas the A-site anticodon re-pairs from YYZ to YYY, allowing for perfect re-pairing except at the wobble position 13. Because the codon:anticodon duplex in the P site is not monitored so strictly as that in the A site, certain deviations from the canonical XXX of the slippery site are tolerated, including GGU, GUU, GGA and GAA 10-14. Frameshifting efficiency ranges from around 5\u201350%, depending on the particular system. In the absence of a 3\u2032 stimulatory RNA structure, certain sequences can still support frameshifting to a level of potentially up to around 2% 12.",

Nonetheless, this could still be consistent with \u22121 PRF if only a very low level of frameshifting were required, or if there were atypical stimulatory elements (e.g. nascent peptide, mRNA\u2013rRNA interactions, RNA structure involving base-pairing with distal elements in the genome or trans-acting factors 15-17,18). More importantly, however, the GAA_AAA_A sequence is in a different frame from the \u22121 PRF X_XXY_YYZ shift site motif, making it inconsistent with the tandem \u22121 slippage model. On the other hand, around half of Potyvirus species have a \u201cG\u201d preceding the conserved GAA_AAA_A sequence (making a canonical \u22121 PRF shift site G_GAA_AAA), while one might propose that other species use \u22121 PRF but with little re-pairing in the P site.",

            "text": "An alternative explanation is that frameshifting occurs at the transcriptional level. In several single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses, such as members of the genus Ebolavirus and the sub-family Paramyxovirinae, the viral polymerase can stutter at a defined site to insert one or more additional nucleotides into a proportion of mRNA transcripts 19. Stuttering involves realignment between the template and nascent RNA strands in the polymerase and preferentially occurs on homopolymeric runs, especially those comprising \u201cA\u201ds or \u201cU\u201ds. In the paramyxoviruses, stuttering occurs on a 3\u2032-UnCm-5\u2032 (n + m \u2265 8) motif in the negative-sense template and results in the insertion of one or more additional \u201cG\u201ds in the positive-sense (5\u2032-AnGm-3\u2032) mRNA for the phosphoprotein gene. In paramyxoviruses, directionality is provided by the ability of RNA to form G:U pairs, but not A:C pairs. In ebolaviruses, stuttering occurs on a run of 7 \u201cU\u201ds in the negative-sense template to insert one or more additional \u201cA\u201ds in the positive-sense mRNA for the glyco-protein gene. However, transcriptional slippage was not considered an obvious explanation for pipo expression because of the short length of the conserved homopolymeric run (just 6 \u201cA\u201ds), and because the conserved 5\u2032 \u201cG\u201d (resulting in a 3\u2032-CU6-5\u2032 sequence in the negative-sense template, opposite in orientation to the paramyxovirus 3\u2032-UnCm-5\u2032 stuttering site) appeared to favour nucleotide deletions over insertions, and two deletions (or one insertion) would be required to provide access to the pipo ORF.",

To enable efficient detection of both P3 and P3N-PIPO with the same antibody, we inserted a sequence encoding the V5 epitope to tag both the P3 and P3N-PIPO proteins near to their N-termini (Fig1). The V5 tag was stably maintained within the virus genome for at least four passages. Using a V5 antibody, it was possible to detect both P3 and P3N-PIPO in protein extracts from upper leaves of plants following inoculation of lower leaves with TuMV-GFP via agroinfiltration (Fig2). P3 was detectable in the early stages of systemic infection (around 5 days post-inoculation [d.p.i.]) and accumulated over time as expected. For the detection of P3N-PIPO, very concentrated protein samples (near lane overloading) were required and P3N-PIPO became detectable in minute quantities only at later timepoints (around 6 d.p.i.; see also Fig3C for 21 d.p.i.), presumably after the virus had spread and accumulated within systemically infected leaves. Due to the massive differences in P3 and P3N-PIPO quantities, and rather poor detection of the latter, the frameshifting efficiency could not be determined reliably using Western analysis. Nonetheless, these experiments demonstrated that P3N-PIPO is produced only in very small amounts relative to the non-frameshift product P3.",

On the other hand, conservation of the final \u201cA\u201d would not be relevant for \u22121 tandem slippage PRF but would be relevant for transcriptional slippage. To further elucidate the frameshifting mechanism, several mutants were constructed (Fig3A). Mutants M1 and M2 carry mutations 5\u2032-adjacent to the GAA_AAA_A sequence that are expected to inhibit possible \u22121 PRF by preventing P-site codon:anticodon re-pairing following a \u22121 shift. Mutant P has mutations at the 3\u2032 end of the GAA_AAA_A sequence that are expected to inhibit possible transcriptional slippage by reducing the length of the homopolymeric run of \u201cA\u201ds. Mutant FSko has mutations in the middle of the GAA_AAA_A sequence that should inhibit frameshifting by either mechanism.

Viral protein accumulation was also analysed. P3 and CP were detected by Western analysis in total protein extracts from patches infiltrated with \u0394GDD, WT, P and FSko. Comparison of protein levels indicated that mutants P and FSko do not accumulate as efficiently as WT virus, though this might be an artefact of the assay as WT virus would reach more cells whereas the movement-deficient mutants would only replicate and accumulate in transformed cells. As expected, much lower levels of P3 and CP were detected in patches infiltrated with the \u0394GDD mutant, consistent with transcription and translation of the T-DNA encoded sequence, without viral replication.

            "text": "The ability of RNA polymerases to slip on homopolymeric sequences above a certain length is believed to be linked to the length and stability of the template:nascent RNA duplex within the polymerase 33. Furthermore, some RNA polymerases appear to be inherently more slip-prone than others 33,34. The duplex length has been reported as 8\u20139 bp for bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerases and 7\u20138 bp for the single-subunit T7 polymerase 35-37, while RdRps of positive-sense RNA viruses in the Picornavirus genus constrain a duplex of 7\u20138 bp 38. In Thermus thermophilus dnaX, slippage occurs at an A9 sequence (T9 template) and is \u223c50% efficient 22. The T7 polymerase slips efficiently (>50%) at U8 and A8, only modestly at U7, and perhaps very slightly at U6\n34. Consistent with this, we observed \u223c2.8% T7 polymerase slippage at GA6 and a comparable level (0.8\u20132.9%) for potyviral RdRps. The role of the conserved 5\u2032 \u201cG\u201d is, however, unclear. Mutation of \u201cG\u201d to \u201cC\u201d or \u201cA\u201d in Soybean mosaic virus did not prevent cell-to-cell movement 8, suggesting that the \u201cG\u201d is not essential for transcriptional slippage. The lack of a conserved nucleotide flanking the 3\u2032 end of the slip site and the observation that a significant number of species have a run of seven instead of six \u201cA\u201ds following the \u201cG\u201d (Appendix Dataset S1) suggest a strand specificity in the slippage mechanism with the G:C pair likely to function during positive-strand synthesis. It is possible that the \u201cG\u201d plays a role in regulating the amount, direction or strand specificity of slippage. In positive-sense RNA virus transcription, unlike in negative-sense RNA virus transcription or DNA-dependent transcription, the template:nascent RNA duplex is likely to extend a considerable distance behind the RdRp footprint, possibly only being disassociated when the next RdRp passes along the template 39-41. Thus, transcriptional slippage in potyvirids may require formation of an unpaired \u201cbulge\u201d nucleotide. The stable G:C base-pairing may be required to limit the extent of bulging to regulate the amount of slippage or to prevent polymerase stalling or drop-off.",

            "text": "Transcriptional slippage poses a problem for RNA viruses because, unlike cellular organisms, the RNA is also the replicative form. Propagation of edited transcripts might lead to a homopolymeric tract of ever-increasing and variable length. The first line of defence against runaway editing may be simple selection during founder events such as transmission between hosts: infection will only be established if a functional polyprotein can be translated from the input genome(s). Ebolaviruses exist as a mixed population of genomes containing either A7 or A8 at the slippage site, with A8 dominating in cell culture and A7 dominating in vivo\n28,42. In contrast, a specific mechanism exists in paramyxoviruses to prevent replication of edited genomes. In negative-sense RNA viruses, the genome and antigenome occur in close association with multiple copies of nucleocapsid protein. In paramyxoviruses, each nucleocapsid is associated with precisely six nucleotides of RNA, and only genomes with lengths that are a multiple of six nucleotides are efficiently replicated 43. A quite different mechanism may operate in potyvirids to prevent the replication of edited transcripts, as follows. In the potyvirus Tobacco etch virus, translation through a region near the 3\u2032 end of the polyprotein ORF is required for the genome to be used efficiently as a replication template 44. It has been hypothesized that this may be due to the ribosome restructuring important RNA elements within the sequence encoding the CP, or ribosome-associated delivery of cis-active replication proteins. Transcripts with one or two insertions or deletions will lead to a frameshift and early termination of translating ribosomes, and therefore, these RNAs will not be replicated.",
