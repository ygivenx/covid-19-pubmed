The rapid response to recent zoonoses outbreaks, such as those of West Nile virus and monkeypox in the United States, Hendra virus in Australia, Nipah virus in Malaysia and Singapore, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China and Canada, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), demonstrates how the mobilisation of considerable political and financial support for the control of emerging diseases is possible on a regional\u2014if not global\u2014scale. These emerging and reemerging zoonoses would appear to be far from \u201cneglected;\u201d the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)'s \u201cGlobal Programme for Avian Influenza Control and Eradication\u201d received a projected budget of US$882 million in 2006 [1]. HPAI in particular continues to attract a substantial amount of support [2], largely driven by \u201cfearful\u201d policy narratives concerning global health securitisation and pandemic preparedness [3].",

The official World Health Organisation (WHO) list of the 17 NTDs includes Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, dengue, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), echinococcus, food-borne disease, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT or sleeping sickness), leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis (river blindness), rabies, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthases, taeniasis/cysticercosis, trachoma, and yaws (endemic treponematoses). The linkages between NTDs, poverty, and the Millennium Development Goals are clearly acknowledged in the literature, for example, the WHO's \u201cGlobal Plan to Combat Neglected Tropical Diseases\u201d [7]. In addition to this group of 17 NTDs, the WHO has identified a subgroup of eight endemic or \u201cneglected zoonotic diseases\u201d (NZDs): anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, T. solium cysticercosis, cystic echinococcosis (hydatidosis), leishmaniasis, rabies, and HAT [8]. These diseases are all common where poverty, reliance on livestock or wildlife for social and financial capital, poor resilience, and the close proximity of people and their animals favour transmission [8], [9]. Unlike the emerging zoonoses, the endemic zoonoses may truly be cast as \u201cneglected\u201d in terms of political profile and relative funding, presenting a greater challenge to researchers, policy makers, and human and animal health professionals working to control these diseases in many parts of the world. This historic lack of investment around NTDs, particularly the NZDs, has largely been attributed to difficulties in estimating their overall burden on society, with the lack of available or accessible diagnostics coupled with wider systemic causes of underreporting cited as difficulties in obtaining accurate evidence for policy [7]\u2013[9].",

A critical step in this process is to reach the World Health Assembly, the supreme decision-making body of the WHO [10]. Meeting annually since WHO's establishment in 1948, the Assembly is attended by representatives from all 194 WHO Member States. Subjects discussed at the WHA are brought forward from Executive Board meetings where resolutions to be taken to the WHA are proposed. Adopted resolutions provide an immediate indication of where WHO focus will lie in terms of policies and programmes that are planned or are taking place worldwide. In this paper, we review all resolutions between 1948 and 2013 for their reference to the eight WHO-defined NZDs that contribute to poverty and examine their recent pathways to advocacy.",

Rabies and brucellosis were assigned expert committees that led to the formation of the WHO Expert Committee for Zoonoses (WHO ECZ) in 1950. The WHO ECZ held a number of joint meetings with FAO in subsequent years to make recommendations for zoonotic disease control, addressing in particular bovine TB, anthrax, and cystic echinococcus [21]\u2013[23].

More importantly, the adoption of a resolution that targets all 17 NTDs as a group marks a significant shift in policy by the WHA.

Many of the proposed strategies for NTD control focus on preventive chemotherapy in humans, for example, administration of antihelmintic drugs to address onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, and the soil-transmitted helminths. In contrast, preventative chemotherapy in humans may not be the most appropriate or cost-effective control strategy for many NZDs given the huge role of the animal or vector reservoirs in many transmission cycles.

However, it is also difficult to gather information about the extent and impact of these diseases of the poor due to ineffective diagnostic capacity and poor health delivery systems that result in underestimation of disease burden.

By examining the various resolutions and references to the eight WHO-listed NZDs throughout the 16 WHA meetings since 1948, it is clear that these diseases have indeed been neglected in recent years in terms of higher policy dialogue at the WHA. A key step in the advocacy process is to achieve the passing of a WHA resolution for the disease(s) in question. In May 2013, Resolution WHA66.12 attempted to address this imbalance for the NTDs. However, three NZDs were omitted from Resolution WHA66.12: anthrax, brucellosis, and bovine tuberculosis. These three were highlighted as grave zoonotic diseases in the early years of the WHO, with ECZs specifically established to discuss their control in 1948\u20131950, and are major zoonoses, impacting human and animal health in developing economies.",

The Resolution raises awareness of the potential for integrated control and surveillance systems that tackle a number of coendemic diseases simultaneously under a One Health approach. Viewing control of zoonotic diseases in terms of a joint approach to improve human and animal health and production in endemic countries makes sense both from a development perspective and also in terms of food safety and security. There is acknowledgment that by addressing the underlying systemic issues of disease surveillance and response for the NZDs, the capacity for detection of emerging zoonoses will also be strengthened. The promotion of a One Health approach towards surveillance and control of NZDs in developing countries is also embedded within the NTD research agenda, being seen as \u201cinterdisciplinary, participatory, and integrated with prevention and control needs\u201d [25].",
