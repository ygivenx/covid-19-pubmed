The incidence of NPC is higher in Southeast Asia and Africa but lower among Caucasians in North America and Europe. In southern China, the incidence rate is approximately 15\u201350 per 100,000 person-years, which is 100-fold higher than that in the Western world [1]. NPC is a complex disease caused by an interaction among Epstein-Barr virus infection, environmental risk factors and host genes in a multi-step process of carcinogenesis [2]. The identification of susceptibility genes contributing to NPC may help clarify the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis and improve the prevention and treatment of this malignancy.",

TERT, as the rate-limiting catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme, plays an essential role in the maintenance of telomere DNA length, chromosomal stability, and cellular immortality [3]. TERT is expressed in the vast majority of human malignant celllines and tumors but not in the corresponding benign tissues [4]. With regard to NPC, elevated telomerase activity and TERT expression levels were detected in tumor tissues compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelium and tissues [5, 6]. Furthermore, for the clinicopathological features in NPC patients, the telomerase activity was observed more frequently in advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis [7, 8]. The other gene in this region, CLPTM1L, which is named for its similarity to a gene implicated in the susceptibility to cleft lip palate, was identified through screening for cisplatin-resistance-related genes. Although the function of this gene is less known, it was found to be upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor cell lines and to induce apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive cells [9]. On the basis of the above functional relevance of the TERT and CLPTM1L genes in the pathogenesis of cancers, we hypothesize that TERT and CLPTM1L may be excellent biological candidate susceptibility genes for cancers.",

Association studies on candidate gene strategy also reported that polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus were associated with serous ovarian, breast, endometrial, lung, and colorectal cancers [18\u201320]. The roles of the polymorphism in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus in NPC, however, have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we examined whether the polymorphism in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus have any bearing on the risk or severity of NPC in Chinese populations.",

However, the rs2735845 and rs401681 polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of NPC in the Guangdong population (Table 2).

            "text": "The genetic associations observed in this study are biologically plausible. There are two genes within the 5p15.33 TERT-CLPTM1L locus through which the association might plausibly be mediated: TERT and CLPTM1L. TERT translates the catalytic protein subunit of the telomerase complex, which elongates the telomere in cells. Telomere-driven genome instability is a widespread cause of genome instability in cancer and is thought to be the crucial event in the development of tumorigenesis [3]. It has been shown that small hairpin RNA can direct against TERT to inhibit cell viability by regulating telomerase activity and its related protein expression in NPC cells [21]. Moreover, overexpression of TERT has been detected in a variety of cancer cells, including NPC [6]. In this study, we also found that the expression of TERT was higher in the NPC tissues compared to the non-cancer nasopharyngeal tissues. Our results, together with those of the earlier studies, suggest that TERT plays an important role in NPC carcinogenesis. CLPTM1L encodes a predicted transmembrane protein, which plays an important role in carcinogenesis. CLPTM1L is upregulated in a cisplatin-resistant ovary cancer cell line and might be involved in the apoptotic response of cells under genotoxic stress caused by cisplatin [9]. CLPTM1L has been reported in the cellular response to genotoxic stress and cisplatin resistance [9]. In addition, over-expression of CLPTM1L has been observed in lung tumors [22]. In this study, we found that the expression of CLPTM1L was higher in the NPC tissues compared to the non-cancer nasopharyngeal tissues, suggesting that the CLPTM1Lhas been implicated in NPC carcinogenesis.",

Both GWAS and candidate gene association studies have identified common variants in 5p15.33 that reproducibly associate with several types of cancer. In 2008, McKay et al. carried out a GWAS of lung cancer, and two independent polymorphisms, rs402710 and rs2736100, were detected [12]. Another GWAS of lung cancer identified another associated polymorphism: rs401681 [11]. Subsequently, Rafnar et al. found that the rs401681 polymorphism was associated with the risk of basal cell, lung, urinary bladder, prostate and cervical cancers and cutaneous melanoma, and rs2736098, a synonymous coding SNP in exon 2 of the TERT gene, was associated with the risk of basal cell, lung, urinary bladder, and prostate cancers [10, 24]. Additionally, a meta-analysis of two GWAS of glioma demonstrated that the rs2736100 polymorphism was associated with the risk of glioma [16]. Petersen et al. conducted a GWAS of pancreatic cancer, and rs401681 was one of the most significantly associated polymorphisms [14]. GWAS of a testicular germ cell tumor identified two independently associated polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus, rs4635969 and rs2736100 [15]. Association studies of candidate gene strategies also reported that SNPs in TERT were associated with serous ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers [25\u201327]. With regard to NPC, Fachiroh et al. and Ko et al. have reported that certain polymorphisms in the TERT gene were associated with NPC risk in Thailand [28, 29]. In this study, we found that two independent SNPs, rs2735845 and rs401681, were significantly associated with the risk of NPC. Our results, together with those of the earlier studies, suggest that the TERT-CLPTM1L locus may be a susceptibility region for NPC.",

The rs401681 polymorphism, which resides in an LD block that contains the CLPTM1L gene and the 5\u2032 end of the TERT gene, is one of the most extensively studied polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus. Rafnar et al. reported that the rs401681 polymorphism may lead to an increase in the gradual shortening of telomeres over time, but the effect may only become apparent after a certain age [10]. In this study, we did not find any association between rs401681 genotypes and TERT and CLPTM1L mRNA levels. We found that the CLPTM1L mRNA levels transcribed by the rs2735845 G allele were higher than those transcribed by the CC genotype in fMSCs. However, the difference in the induction of the reporter gene expression between the rs2735845 two alleles is not statistically significant (data not shown).

All subjects were unrelated ethnic Han Chinese and residents in Nanning city and the surrounding regions. The diagnosis of patients, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients and controls, and the definition of smokers and drinkers were described in detail in our previous studies [30]. Briefly, the patients with NPC were newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed, and they were consecutively recruited at the Guangxi Cancer Hospital (Nanning, China) between September 2003 and January 2008. The response rate for case patients was 95%. Patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery or had another type of cancer were excluded from this study. The controls were randomly selected from a community cancer screening program for early detection of cancer conducted in the same regions during the same time period in which the NPC patients were collected. The response rate for control subjects was 91%. The selection criteria for the controls included no individual history of cancer. The Guangdong population, which was used for the 2nd stage replication analysis, consisted of 997 patients and 972 controls. The diagnosis of patients and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients and controls were described in detail previously [31]. Briefly, the patients with NPC were newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed, and they were consecutively recruited from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC, Guangzhou, China) between October 2005 and October 2007. Only the patients who were self-reported as Guangdong Chinese and who lived in Guangdong province were recruited. During the same period, healthy controls were recruited from physical examination centers of several large comprehensive hospitals in the local communities of Guangdong. The selection criteria for the controls included no individual history of cancer. The response rate for cases and control was 90%. For both populations, tumor staging was performed according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification of the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system. All TNM classifications were determined by senior pathologists of the hospital on the basis of the postoperative histopathologic examination.",

The slides were washed in xylene to remove the paraffin and then rehydrated through serial dilutions of alcohol, followed by washings with a solution of PBS (pH 7.2).
