            "text": "Over the last half century infectious diseases have emerged with increasing frequency [1]. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have profound public health and economic consequences as highlighted by the ongoing epidemics of Ebola virus in West Africa [2], MERS coronavirus in the Middle East [3], and chikungunya and West Nile viruses in the Americas [4]. The emergence of these diseases can, in large part, be attributed to the increased frequency and duration of human and livestock interactions with wildlife populations [5]. Greater than 60% of EIDs since 1940 are due to zoonotic infections [1]. Biosurveillance efforts now focus on crucial interfaces (i.e. transmission between animals, initial human spillover events and localized emergence) in order to identify pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential [6,7]. Yet allocation of resources are not always directed towards predicted emerging disease \u2018hotspots\u2019 like tropical Africa where relatively few EID events have been documented locally [1]. This is mainly due to difficulties in sample collection, storage and transport from remote and underdeveloped parts of the world. Although a wide array of assays exist to detect emerging pathogens (e.g. [8\u201310]), novel and inexpensive methods for sample collection and for pathogen detection are needed to use them most effectively.",

A large majority of these are hematophagous and rely on vertebrate blood for nourishment and reproduction. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto is the major human malaria vector in Africa. This species is highly anthropophilic (>95% of bloodmeals come from humans when control measures are absent), feeds frequently, and prefers to blood feed at night and often in human dwellings [11]. After blood feeding, these mosquitoes rest on interior walls for several hours digesting their newly acquired bloodmeal before they exit the dwelling. While engorged, their mobility is limited, and it is at this vulnerable point that they can be easily collected via aspiration and bloodmeals analyzed for the presence of pathogens, a process we have termed xenosurveillance. Recently, Kading et al. demonstrated that mosquitoes could be used as \u2018biological syringes\u2019 to accurately quantify viremias in animals [12]. In fact, two recent field studies have demonstrated that vertebrate viral pathogens that are not vector-borne could be detected in the bloodmeals of Culicidae mosquitoes [13,14]. These findings suggest that hematophagous insects, specifically mosquitoes, could make sample acquisition and pathogen surveillance more tractable in remote tropical locales.",

            "text": "Several important questions remain to be answered when evaluating the ultimate utility and feasibility of xenosurveillance. Specifically, variables influencing pathogen detection such as the duration between mosquito blood feeding and mosquito processing, the pathogen nucleic acid stability in the mosquito gut and the pathogen load present in the host\u2019s blood at the time of bloodmeal ingestion remain to be determined. Therefore, we examined some of these variables and hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect animal pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. We tested our hypothesis using An. gambiae mosquitoes and, because at least a quarter of human emerging pathogens are viruses [1], viruses from four evolutionarily distinct families, none of which are vectored by An. gambiae mosquitoes. To make this approach more tractable in remote tropical regions, we preserved the bloodmeals onto Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) filter paper cards for subsequent nucleic acid detection [15\u201317]. Finally, we collected An. gambiae bloodmeals from houses in two remote villages in northern Liberia and analyzed them by next generation sequencing (NGS) and PCR to validate our methods. It should be noted that the use of highly anthropophilic An. gambiae mosquitoes may preclude the identification of potentially zoonotic viruses before they cross the species barrier; however, it will enable the detection of pathogens that have already gained the ability to infect humans but that remain undetected due to limited infection and spread, subclinical illness or clinical misdiagnoses. Our results suggest that xenosurveillance can be used in high-risk tropical regions to detect pathogen outbreaks at early stages of emergence.",

Battery powered Insecta-Zooka (BioQuip, Rancho Dominguez, CA) aspirators were used to collect mosquitoes resting on the walls, ceilings and bed nets inside of the village houses (S1A Fig.). Using mouth aspirators (Model 412; John W. Hock Company, Gainesville, FL), mosquitoes were transferred from the collection cups to 16 oz cardboard containers screened with organdy (and labeled with date and location) and immediately transported to a field lab (S1B Fig.). For long-term anesthesia, the mosquito cartons were placed inside of a plastic bag container containing a wick dipped in triethylamine for 1\u20132 min (S1C Fig.). The mosquitoes were sorted by blood feeding status (S1D Fig.), and all aspirated mosquitoes were identified as An. gambiae sensu stricto as previously described [24]. Forceps clutching the thorax were used to hold blood fed mosquitoes in place while the contents of the abdomen were pressed onto 96-well format FTA cards (one blood meal per \u201cwell\u201d) using sterile pipet tips (S1E Fig.). The forceps were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mosquitoes. The blood meals were gently spread using the pipet tip and 2\u20135 \u03bcl of ethanol was added to help diffuse the blood into the card (5 \u03bcl of sterile PBS is an alternative option, see S2 Fig.).

The desiccant was changed every day for three days then the pouches were stored in a cool, dry place for 1\u20133 weeks until being transported to CSU, whereupon they were stored at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction.

Ratios of viral RNA titers post blood feeding (mosquito bloodmeals applied onto FTA cards) to pre blood feeding (2 \u03bcl blood applied onto FTA cards) were used to make comparisons between recovery of RNA from artificial and hamster bloodmeals (Fig. 3C). A ratio <1 indicates a loss of viral RNA recovery through the use of mosquito bloodmeals. From both artificial blood meals and those from infected hamsters, the WNV RNA recovery ratio was <1, indicating that WNV RNA recovery from M-DBS was less efficient than from DBS; although not significantly (Fig. 2A). Similarly, M-DBS acquired from actively replicating virus in hamsters did not significantly differ from WNV-spiked blood in an artificial feeder. In contrast, the recovery ratio of PIRV RNA was approximately 1 and also did not differ between the two blood feeding methods (Fig. 3C).",

The PathoScope alignment summaries to the reference genome libraries are shown in Table 3. NGS analysis of the microbial composition in bloodfed An. gambiae collected within homes in rural Liberia revealed the presence of numerous mosquito midgut microbiota (e.g. Acinetobacter and Pantoea) and human skin-associated microbes (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes) (S3 Fig), some as detected previously [35]. In addition, genetic signatures for EBV were identified in all eight field-derived M-DBS pools, but not the control pool generated from laboratory mosquitoes that had fed upon defibrinated sheep\u2019s blood. Recovered EBV reads were distributed across the length of the genome (Fig. 4) and displayed varying levels of abundance (Table 3). This result was confirmed by using RT-PCR to detect EBV-encoded RNA 2 (highly abundant EBV transcripts during latent infection [36]) in all eight pooled M-DBSs from Liberia. Furthermore, we identified signatures of CDV in the M-DBS pool from Village A d7 (Fig. 4) and we confirmed that this was the only pool containing CDV RNA by RT-PCR. Upon further inspection, only 1 of 57 M-DBSs from Village A d7 was positive for CDV and the sequenced 400 bp L gene (polymerase) amplicon was most similar to a South American isolate of CDV (97% nucleotide identity to GenBank accession number KM280689). Genetic material derived from porcine and canine origin was also identified in this pool by NGS. Using cytochrome b PCR, we identified that the M-DBS containing CDV RNA was the only bloodmeal from Village A d7 that was obtained from a dog. Isolation of either of the aforementioned viruses was not attempted because the FTA cards fully inactivate viruses [37,38]. Library quality and analysis accuracy were validated by the presence of reads aligning to An. gambiae, humans, and Plasmodium falciparum from all field-collected sample pools (S3 Fig.). The presence of P. falciparum in our samples would be expected because malaria is holoendemic in this region and the mosquito, the human upon which it fed, or both may be infected.",

An. gambiae mosquitoes imbibe several times their body weight in blood, and they spend several hours immediately following bloodmeal acquisition undergoing the initial stages of bloodmeal digestion [39]. Consequently the mosquito midgut becomes a highly proteolytic environment that facilitates the degradation of the blood contents over approximately the first 24 hours after blood ingestion [40]. Previous studies have demonstrated that vertebrate pathogens, specifically viruses, can be detected in the bloodmeal of recently engorged mosquitoes [12\u201314], but the stability and recovery rates of viral RNA after prolonged exposure to the mosquito midgut was undefined. Therefore, we assessed our ability to recover WNV and HIV-1 RNA from An. gambiae and revealed that 12 hours exposure to the midgut environment did not significantly decrease the recovery of viral RNA. However, we did observe a significant reduction in WNV RNA recovery as a result of blood application onto FTA cards. Surprisingly, a similar reduction was not observed for HIV-1. This discrepancy might be explained by the relative stability of each of the viruses [41,42]. Alternatively, there may be differences in the efficiency of binding to and/ or elution from FTA cards between the two viral RNA species. These observations may need further examination to determine if biases are being introduced in future sampling efforts. While there are some discrepancies with viral RNA recovery from FTA cards, overall these findings demonstrate that viral RNA remains mostly protected from the highly proteolytic environment of the mosquito midgut and that mosquitoes can be used to sample viral pathogens in human beings.",

Because of this broad range of times, we assessed the efficacy of our approach over varying post-feeding durations. We found that we could reliably detect WNV RNA in extracted bloodmeals for up to 18 hpf and up to 24 hours for HIV-1. The aforementioned differences in viral stability may account for the observed discrepancy in our detection at 24 hpf [41, 42].

We observed significant differences in our ability to detect each of the four viruses with HIV-1 having the lowest 50% endpoint detection (~105 RNA copies/ml) and CHIKV having the highest (~107 RNA copies/ml). These large discrepancies between the viruses could in part be explained by potential differences in viral stability or binding to and/ or elution efficiency from FTA cards.

Furthermore, it is unknown if and how cells may affect the stability of viral RNA in the context of the mosquito midgut.

NGS based metagenomics can be used to characterize the genomic landscape of complex biological or environmental samples without a priori knowledge of the microbial community [9]. Therefore, we determined if NGS-directed metagenomics approach could be used to detect pathogen-derived genetic signatures in field-collected samples. We found evidence of two potentially important animal viruses, EBV and CDV. EBV is a highly prevalent gamma-herpesvirus that infects B-lymphocytes and develops latency [36,43]. Because of its tissue tropism and its associated reactivation during P. falciparum infections, it is not surprising that latent EBV infections of white blood cells would be readily detectable by our approach in a P. falciparum holoendemic region such as Liberia [43]. CDV is a morbillivirus (related to measles virus) and an emerging virus of veterinary significance. Spillover of CDV from domestic dogs has caused mass mortality in endangered African carnivores [44\u201346]. Detection of CDV from one mosquito that fed on a dog in a pool of 57 M-DBSs is important for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the sensitivity of using NGS to screen for pathogen signatures in pooled M-DBS. Second, it suggests that xenosurveillance may be useful for the detection of veterinary or zoonotic pathogens in areas where indoor-resting mosquitoes prefer to feed on domestic animals [47,48]. Currently, the costs associated with NGS are impractically high for resource-poor regions; however, costs have been falling precipitously far outpacing the predictions associated with Moore\u2019s Law [49]. In addition to NGS, we demonstrated that viruses and bloodmeal sources could also be detected by more cost efficient PCR-based methods from pooled and individual M-DBSs, further broadening the utility of xenosurveillance.",

            "text": "Biosurveillance is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting biosphere data in order to provide early detection of biological threats to human or animal health. However this process can be labor intensive, complex, costly, and ineffective, particularly in under-developed and remote locales such as tropical Africa. In this manuscript we describe the use of a novel sample acquisition and processing strategy termed xenosurveillance that can be used to improve the collection, storage, and shipment of biological samples from the field. Collecting bloodfed mosquitoes from houses is relatively easy, inexpensive and noninvasive compared to finger-pricks or venous blood draws. These factors may make it ideal for longitudinal sampling surveys and identification of viruses that induce transient viremias. In our experience, villagers welcome taking mosquitoes from their houses frequently, which may reduce their risk of future infections from vector-borne pathogens like Plasmodium. Consent from the head-of-households for mosquito collections is required, but xenosurveillance is not equivalent to sampling blood from patients directly, which requires individual informed consent, because the exact source of any bloodmeal cannot be identified without a matching blood sample from a patient. This is because up to 10% of An. gambiae bloodmeals are acquired from individuals living outside the home in which the mosquito was captured and up 20% have acquired bloodmeals from two or more people [11]. Nonetheless, xenosurveillance identification of the genetic signatures of certain pathogens (eg. HIV) should require, at minimum, notification to the local public health authorities of the possibility of the pathogen circulating in the area of the sampling. Aside from sample acquisition, xenosurveillance also offers benefits when processing samples. For instance, this approach offers increased portability because very few tools/ reagents are required and FTA cards eliminate the need for a cold-chain [15\u201317]. Moreover, the chemical properties associated with FTA cards completely inactivates viruses as has been previously demonstrated for two divergent enveloped RNA viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Arteriviridae) and Newcastle disease virus (Paramyxoviridae) [37,38], thereby increasing the safety of handling and simplifying international shipping. While we specifically addressed the utility of this workflow in the context of viral pathogens, the procedure could be applied to any pathogen found circulating in the blood of humans and other animals (although the sensitivity and duration of detection still need to be validated for non-virus pathogens). We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and determined the limits of detection using qRT-PCR on individual M-DBS as well as identified vertebrate viral pathogens from field-caught mosquitoes. Regardless of the bio-detection technology utilized, such samples can be used for the early detection of recent spillover events or of pathogens with epidemic potential. Furthermore, previous studies suggest that this approach could be used to complement traditional sero-epidemiological studies [50,51]. Finally, while this study exclusively examined the utility of mosquitoes for the purpose of xenosurveillance, there is no reason to believe that other hematophagous insects or other animals (e.g. leeches) cannot be used for similar purposes [52,53]. Together, this approach provides an attractive alternative to conventional approaches for epidemiological and surveillance studies of human pathogens in remote tropical locations.",
