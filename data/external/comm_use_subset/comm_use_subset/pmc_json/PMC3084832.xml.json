Serological studies reported IgG antibodies recognizing\nintracellular melanocyte and melanoma-associated antigens such as tyrosinase,\ntyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1, TRP-2, and melanoma-associated glycoprotein\nantigen family (gp100/pmel17) in patients with melanoma. Serum-resident antibodies\nto some of these antigens were enhanced following polyvalent melanoma cell vaccine\nimmunization in patients with melanoma, suggesting that melanoma-associated antigens\nmay be immunogenic and that humoral responses to melanocyte and melanoma antigens\nmay constitute potential targets for immunotherapy [27]. New antigens, such as the\nNY-ESO-1, with restricted expression in normal tissues and wide distribution in\nvarious cancers including melanoma have been discovered using serological analysis\nof recombinant cDNA expression libraries (SEREX) techniques tested against tumor\nmRNA and autologous patient sera [28]. SEREX studies from human melanomas [29] and from one cell line [30] have led to the\ndiscovery of the human testis antigen HOM-MEL-40. Many of these antigens are\nprimarily intracellular, making them less attractive targets as monoclonal\nantibodies. Furthermore, serological screens may also be limited by the temporal\ndynamics of sera antibodies. Evaluating the reactivity of antibodies secreted by\ncirculating B cells may therefore provide additional insight to serological\nevaluations by interrogating the long-term memory anti-tumor systemic mature humoral\nresponse to cancer.",

Due to the\ninherent variability of cell-based assays, and the potential identification of\nfalse positive cultures, we chose more stringent criteria for antibody\nscreening, by comparing antibodies produced by B cells to a positive control\nantibody (> 75% OD of positive control). Based on this antibody\nselection criteria (>75% OD of positive control), we estimate that\n28% of B cell cultures (n = 1,800) derived from 21\npatients, each arising from 500 B cells, produced antibodies that recognized\nmetastatic melanoma cells, compared to 2% (n = 600)\nof cultures derived from 10 healthy volunteers (Figure 4, B). From these 10 healthy\nvolunteers, 2 individuals had one reactive culture (out of 60 cultures), 1\nindividual had 10 reactive cultures, and the rest of the cohort had no reactive\ncultures.",

            "text": "As a first step to evaluate the tumor reactivity and specificity of patient B\ncell-derived IgG antibodies, we developed a medium-throughput cell-based ELISA with\nmelanoma cells to detect antibodies against tumor cell surface antigens (Figure 1). Cells were allowed to\ngrow and adhere on to 96-well plates prior to being preserved by a light fixative\n(0.5% formaldehyde). While preserving the cells and allowing for storage and\naccess to multiple plates at any one time, light fixation with formalin allows\npreservation of potentially-antigenic epitopes on the surface of target cells.\nPrevious studies have reported cell-based ELISA methods to identify tumor-specific\nantibodies in melanoma [39], [41], where tumor cells were preserved using strong fixatives\nsuch as glutaraldehyde, known to potentially mask antigenic epitopes, thus\ncompromising the recognition of antigens by antibodies [42]. Furthermore, the specificity\nand sensitivity of such methods has not been reported using antibodies against known\ncell surface antigens. Although many intracellular melanoma associated antigens have\nbeen described (tyrosinase, TRP-1, TRP-2, gp100/pmel17), most are also expressed by\nnormal melanocytes, only a few defined cell surface antigens such as the High\nMolecular Weight Melanoma-Associated Antigen (HMW-MAA) are reported to be expressed\non the surface of melanoma cells, and other antigens show heterogeneous expression\namong patients [43],\n[44]. Thus,\nthis ELISA constitutes an attractive tool to evaluate broad responses to any\nnaturally-expressed antigens on the surface of melanoma cells and melanocytes in\nthis context. This screening methodology has additional potential advantages. Unlike\nassays screening against a single recombinant antigen or antigenic epitope, our\nmethod enables the evaluation of antibody repertoires of patients against a\nmultitude of cell surface antigens in their native confirmation on the surface of\nboth primary and metastatic melanoma cells and also melanocytes, providing more\ncomprehensive information on the broad prevalence of tumor-reactive and\ntumor-specific antibodies. Previous studies have shown concordance of cell\nline-associated antigens with antigens expressed on corresponding tumors, making\nthem a suitable platform for tumor-reactive antibody screening [26], [45]. Thus, cell lines provide a\npromising alternative source of multiple tumor antigens in the absence of multiple\nwell-defined, highly expressed, and readily available recombinant antigens. Unlike\nflow cytometric evaluations, the cell-based ELISA does not require the use of\nproteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, therefore better preserving cell surface\nantigens. Plates of target cells can be prepared, fixed and frozen in batches, thus\nallowing for higher throughput screening for tumor cell-reactive antibodies. It can\nbe applied to evaluate > 300 culture supernatants against cell lines within a few\nhours. In principle, numerous ELISA plates for screening a range of cell lines with\nmultiple supernatant samples can be processed simultaneously. Additionally, this\nmethodology may be a potential tool for immunomonitoring tumor-specific humoral\nresponses to therapies; selecting patients most likely to benefit from\nimmunotherapy; or as a prognostic factor in linking tumor-reactive humoral responses\nto clinical outcomes. This assay may also be utilized to detect surface antigens in\na range of cell types, and thus may be adapted to monitor the B cell-derived\nantibody repertoire in different disease contexts.",

            "text": "While tumor-reactive antibodies were detected from most melanoma patients studied,\nantibody responses derived from circulating B cells against melanoma cells decreased\nwith more advanced disease stages (Figure 3). Previous serological studies report serum-resident antibodies\nagainst tumor cells in melanoma patients, with some evidence that serum antibodies\nare diminished in patients with advanced disease [25], [47]. It was unclear whether this\nwas a consequence of the sequestering of antibodies into tumors with increasing\ntumor burden in these patients. Our findings provide further insight by\ndemonstrating the presence of a circulating long-term mature B cell response to\ncancer at all disease stages, against a broad range of naturally expressed antigens\non the surface of primary and metastatic tumor cells. We also report decreased\nfrequency of tumor-reactive antibody-producing B cells with advanced disease, thus\nsupporting the premise that mechanisms of immune tolerance rather than adsorption of\nantibodies into tumors in advanced disease setting may also explain these\nreductions. One limitation may arise from screening for antibodies against mostly\nmetastatic melanoma cells. It is possible that our observations may reflect\nreactivity to antigens present in primary disease, which may be preserved or\nupregulated in advanced disease setting. While our findings may not account for\nreactivity to tumor antigens that are lost with disease progression, this reduced\nreactivity to melanoma we observed may imply weakened immune responses to a subset\nof antigens on the surface of melanoma cells. Another explanation for these\nobservations may be that with advanced disease, mature circulating B cells home into\nincreasing tumor sites, thus reducing the circulating tumor-reactive B cell\ncompartment in these patients. Future studies aimed at monitoring local B cell\nresponses in tumors may provide further clues into the dynamics of mature B cell\nresponses at the systemic and local levels in cancer. Thus, despite well-known\nweakened host immune response with disease progression [48], we were able to detect\nmelanoma-reactive antibodies from patient circulating B cells, implying that\nalthough mature humoral immune responses are weakened, responses in the form of\nmature memory B cells may persist. However, further work elucidating potential\nimmunomodulatory roles of B cells and other immune cells in cancer, including the\nproduction of IL-10 by B cell population subsets [49], merits consideration.",

For this, we measured the capacity of one antibody clone to kill\ntumor cells. Antibody clone 6_2G3 derived from a patient with stage III disease\n(Patient 6, Table 1) was not\nobserved to bind to fibroblasts or melanocytes, but bound to a proportion of\nmelanoma cell lines tested (Figure\n5). Antibodies against tumor-associated antigens can attack tumor cells\nvia a number of mechanisms including induction of apoptosis in tumor cells and\nengaging Fc receptors on immune cells [50], [51], [52], [53]. Antibodies approved\nfor the treatment of cancer have been shown to function through one or more of these\nmechanisms [54],\n[55]. While\nour strategy yields fully human monoclonal antibodies in a matter of a few months,\nwe were limited in the amount of antibody we could produce from the B cells to\nperform functional studies and evaluate reactivity to patient-derived melanoma\ntumors. However, we had sufficient quantity to evaluate whether a patient-derived\nmelanoma tumor-specific monoclonal antibody could mediate antibody dependent\ncellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the presence of monocytic effector cells and tumor\ncells using a real-time live cell imaging assay. We show that the tumor-specific\n6_2G3 clone is capable of mediating ADCC in vitro and additionally\nmeasured the restricted movement of monocytic effector cells once in contact with\ntumor-specific antibody-coated tumor cells, providing further evidence of ADCC\n(Figure 6). These\npreliminary assessments provide a promising clue that a potentially active mature B\ncell response against melanoma may be present in patients. An example of this\npossibility was recently reported by Yuan et al. who demonstrated that\nadministration of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab led to serological enhancement\nof antibodies to the testis antigen NY -ESO-1 in patients who responded to the\nantibody therapy [56].

            "text": "Harnessing the cancer-specific antibody repertoire of cancer patients using the\nmethodology described herein may also potentially offer an alternate strategy to\nyield IgG antibodies against cancer antigens. Recent advances reported by Traggiai\net al., evaluating monoclonal antibodies from human memory B cells have yielded\nfully-human virus-neutralizing antibodies of therapeutic relevance for infectious\ndiseases and have contributed to the dissection of humoral memory responses to\nvaccinations [35], [57], [58]. Here, we focus on B cells from cancer patients such as\nmelanoma patients, analyze systemic humoral responses to cancer and demonstrate the\npresence of tumor-reactive and tumor-specific antibodies. This approach may offer an\nadvantage over other approaches such as phage display in that it yields in\nvivo affinity-matured human antibodies with naturally paired heavy and\nlight chains. The patient-derived monoclonal antibody 6_2G3 bound to 2 out of 6 of\nthe melanoma cell lines evaluated compared to melanocytes, suggesting that this\nantibody may be against a protein over-expressed or mutated on the surface of cancer\ncells. In light of the efficacy of Trastuzumab, against the\nHER2/neu antigen expressed on 20\u201330% of breast\ncancers, as a clinically-validated therapeutic tool for the treatment of an\nequivalent proportion of breast cancer patients [59], selection of antibodies that\nbind to a portion of cell lines may merit further characterization. Although the\nclinical significance of mature memory B cells expressing antibodies that recognize\ntumor cells in patients remains to be elucidated, antibodies derived from these\ncells, introduced by passive immunotherapy in therapeutically-relevant doses, such\nas those used for Trastuzumab to patients with breast cancer, merit investigation\nfor any potential relevance in melanoma. Other potential future benefits of\nscreening patient-derived B cells from tumor-reactive antibodies may be\nidentification of novel cell surface tumor antigens. Future evaluations of clone\n6_2G3 will include sequence analysis and expression cloning to allow for further\nanalyses of specificity to melanoma tumors, antigen identification, and for thorough\nfunctional assessments.",
