These include inflammation, increased airway reactivity, and an increased susceptibility to infection. Ozone exposure has been reported to disrupt epithelial integrity, impair effective phagocytosis, and compromise mucociliary clearance [1]. However, other studies where increased epithelial permeability and changes in ventilation are not observed indicate that these effects may be highly ozone dose-dependent [5]. Ozone effects are more pronounced in asthmatics [4], especially children [3]. Interestingly, ozone-induced inflammation, as measured by neutrophil influx and IL-8 levels, differs between normal subjects and asthmatics, but does not correlate with pulmonary function changes [2]. Differences in the response to ozone among individuals having polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress implicate oxidative stress in these processes and provide a basis for varying susceptibility to ozone-induced symptoms [7].",

            "text": "Mechanisms involved in ozone-induced lung damage have been investigated in animal models [8-14]. In general, experimental animals require significantly higher doses of O3 exposure than humans [15] to reach comparable amounts of O3 concentration in the distal lung. Measurement of various parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed that resting rodents exposed to high O3 doses (2 ppm) were either comparable (polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), protein) or lower (macrophages) than the exercising human exposed to considerably lower O3 exposures (0.44 ppm). Therefore, it is necessary that rodents be exposed to high O3 concentrations to better enable extrapolation of findings from animal studies to human. Our laboratory has demonstrated ozone-dependent changes in mice in epithelial permeability, inflammatory mediators, and susceptibility to pneumonia [8,9,16]. The changes in epithelial permeability have been attributed to TLR-4-mediated changes in iNOS activity [12]. A role for oxidative stress in ozone-induced pathophysiology has been postulated based on increases in F2-isoprostane [13], a lipid peroxidation product, as well as reductions in inflammatory mediators and allergen sensitivity by antioxidant treatment [10]. The involvement of oxidative stress is further supported by studies in which genetic polymorphisms influence the response to ozone [17]. Although the pathophysiology of ozone-induced lung damage is incompletely understood, these mechanistic and genetic association studies provide a strong rationale for oxidative stress [7] playing a key role in the response to ozone exposure.",

Ozone has been implicated in increasing susceptibility to infection in humans [18,19] and in a number of animal studies (reviewed in [1]), as have other sources of oxidative stress such as sublethal hyperoxia [20]. The basis for these effects is not known, but may relate to the oxidative modification of molecules involved in innate immune processes by reactive oxidant species, lipid peroxidation products, or other molecules generated by oxidative stress. Oxidation of protein molecules can interfere with their function and alter their metabolism by either promoting their degradation or causing the formation of protein aggregates that are not readily degraded [21,22].",

            "text": "Surfactant protein-A (SP-A), a major component of BAL, is an example of an innate immune protein whose function is disrupted by oxidation. SP-A is known to play a variety of roles in innate immune function. These include serving as an opsonin for the recognition of some pathogens [23,24], regulating the production of cell surface antigens and inflammatory mediator expression by some immune cells [25,26], participating in the development of dendritic cells [27], regulating reactive oxidant production [28,29], and others [30]. However, a series of studies from our laboratory has shown that several of these functions are compromised when SP-A is oxidized)[9,31-34]. A number of studies have explored the function of SP-A in vivo by subjecting SP-A-/- (SP-A knockout; KO) mice to various infectious or environmental challenges. These include studies of susceptibility to bacterial infection [35,36], susceptibility to viral infection [37,38], oxidant-mediated killing of mycoplasma [39], response to ozone exposure [8,16], and the impact of ozone exposure on susceptibility to pneumonia [16]. These in vivo studies have confirmed the diversity of SP-A's influence on innate immune function. Several studies from our laboratory have explored the role of SP-A in vivo in ozone exposure and innate immunity [8,9,16]. We have shown that the response of KO mice to acute ozone exposure, while similar in many respects to that of wild type (WT) mice, has some unique features including the influx of immune cells into the alveolar spaces. KO mice apparently sustain more tissue damage than WT mice, as indicated by BAL lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels detectable immediately after a 3 hr ozone exposure. However, at 4 hr after a 3 hr exposure to ozone lower relative numbers of neutrophils were observed in KO mice than WT mice [8], in part explaining the differences in lung mRNA levels for MIP-2, and to a lesser degree for MCP-1, between the two strains. Paradoxically however, no differences were observed in MIP-2 and MCP-1 protein levels between the two strains, underscoring, perhaps, the complexity of the processes involved. We have also shown that ozone exposure increases the susceptibility of mice to infection, at least in part due to the oxidation of SP-A [9], and that KO mice are more susceptible to infection than WT mice [16].",

This type of unbiased approach is not dependent upon previously published studies and may be instrumental in generating specific novel hypotheses involving proteins and pathways that may not have been previously implicated in the process being studied.

In one case, differences between an ozone-sensitive strain and an ozone-resistant strain in the response to ozone were explored [46], and in the other, the effects of ozone on 1-nitronaphthalene adduct formation were probed [45]. In the present study we exposed WT and KO mice to ozone or filtered air and studied the resulting changes in the BAL proteome using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a discovery proteomics technique [47-49] for quantitation, coupled with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight/Time-of-Flight (MALDI-ToF/ToF) tandem mass spectrometry for identification of proteins. These techniques make it possible to simultaneously analyze hundreds of proteins in biological samples and have helped identify both pathways and additional proteins involved in these pathways in various experimental systems [50-52]. We recently employed a similar approach to examine age-related changes in the rat BAL proteome)[53]. This combination of methods for protein quantification and identification of proteins has proven useful in quantitative comparisons of protein expression and has not been previously applied to a comparison of this kind of SP-A KO mice with WT mice on the same genetic background.",

The ozone system efficiently delivers ozone concentrations between 0.1 ppm and 10 ppm. Ozone is generated by an electric discharge ozonizer (Model OZ2SS-SS, Ozotech, Yreka, CA) and its concentration is monitored continuously with an ultraviolet ozone analyzer (Model 400A, Advanced Pollution Instrumentation, San Diego, CA, USA).

BALs were mixed with an equal volume of lyophilized buffer to avoid further dilution of the BAL and then filtered through a 0.22 micron spin filter. After filtration, 0.2 ml of lavage was run through the MARS cartridge at one time for a total of 6 times for each sample (following the manufacturer's protocol), collecting and pooling the flow-through fractions (F1 and F2) for each, totaling a volume of around 6 ml for each sample. Bound fractions of protein were eluted from the cartridge, totaling a volume of around 12 ml for each sample and saved for further analysis.

Samples from each group were randomly assigned to Cy3 or Cy5 to ensure no dye-based artifacts in quantitation. Aliquots of 12.5 \u03bcg of BAL protein from each sample were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 (200 picomoles). A normalization pool was created by combining equal amounts of protein from every sample (16 samples) and an aliquot of the pool was labeled with Cy2 (200 picomoles). Equal amounts of Cy3-labeled sample, Cy5-labeled sample, and Cy2-labeled pool samples were mixed. The use of a normalization pool is advantageous as this serves as an internal standardization tool for all gels/samples under study, and thus the possibility of erroneous conclusions due to different concentration loads and other related issues is significantly diminished. An equal volume of 2\u00d7 sample buffer (2 M thiourea, 7 M urea, 2% pH 3\u201310 nonlinear (NL) IPG buffer, 1.2% DeStreak reagent) was added to all samples including the unlabeled preparative gel sample and then brought up to a volume of 450 \u03bcl with rehydration buffer (DeStreak\u2122 Rehydration Solution, 0.5% pH 3\u201310 NL IPG buffer). Proteins were subjected to isoelectric focusing on 24 cm pH 3\u201310 NL gradient Immobiline DryStrips (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) by using an IPGphor II apparatus (GE Healthcare) at 20\u00b0C and under mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Proteins were focused by using the following voltages and times: 14 hour at 0 V (passive rehydration); 6 hour at 30 V (active rehydration); 3 hour at 300 V (step and hold); 3 hour at 600 V (gradient); 3 hour at 1000 V (gradient); 3 hour at 8000 V (gradient); 4 hour at 8000 V (step and hold). Each of the strips were equilibrated in equilibration solution-1 (50 mM TrisCl, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 0.5% dithiothreitol) and equilibration solution-2 (50 mM TrisCl, 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 4.5% iodoacetamide) for 15 min respectively. After isoelectric focusing the IEF strips were applied to 10% polyacrylamide gels (26 cm-w \u00d7 20 cm-h \u00d7 1 mm thick), sealed with 0.5% low melting point agarose containing bromophenol blue in a buffer of 1\u00d7 Tris/glycine/SDS buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% (W/V) SDS, pH 8.3) run overnight at 2 W/gel at 20\u00b0C using the EttanDALT system (GE Healthcare) for separation of proteins on the basis of molecular weight. For the preparative picking gel and the gels used to confirm depletion, a single plate for each gel plate sandwich was treated with Bind-Silane solution (80% ethanol, 0.02% glacial acetic acid, 0.001% Bind-Silane) and had reference markers placed on them. After the completion of electrophoresis, the plates that had not been silane-treated were removed from the sandwich and the gels were fixed with 30% methanol, 7.5% glacial acetic acid 2 times for 1 hour.",

For each sample, an initial mass spectrum was collected. Measurements were collected in the positive ion reflectron mode between 800 and 4000 m/z with a signal-to-noise filter of 10, mass exclusion tolerance of 0.2 Da, and a peak density filter of 50 peaks per 200 Da.

However, there were only 6 cases (not including SP-A) where these differences between WTFA and KOFA achieved statistical significance. A similar situation was observed when we compared WTO3 to KOO3 values where values for a given protein followed this progression, but differences were only significant in a few cases.

This delayed oxidation coincides with an influx of neutrophils into the alveolar space that may be a consequence of their activation by ozone-induced tissue damage and the subsequent production of RONS by these cells. In the present study, most of the significant changes in levels of expression of the RED protein group involved in redox balance were decreases, a finding that would be consistent with increased degradation of proteins that had been oxidatively modified while neutralizing reactive oxidants [110]. On the other hand, in the PMM group of proteins with roles in protein metabolism and modification and the chaperones, half of these proteins changed significantly with most undergoing increases after ozone exposure. One could speculate that this is a response to the increased oxidative modification of proteins and the apparent increased turnover of the proteins involved in regulating redox balance. Thus, the data from this discovery proteomics study, together with previously published data [8], support the postulate that in response to ozone-induced oxidative stress there is an increase in total protein oxidation and this reflects decreases in proteins involved in redox balance and increases in proteins involved in protein modification and metabolism.",

There is precedent for selective changes in susceptibility. Published studies have shown that genetic ablation of SP-A increases the susceptibility of the SP-A KO mouse to organisms whose recognition and clearance are highly dependent on SP-A, such as group B streptococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [35,36]. On the other hand, increased levels of SP-A can predispose the host to organisms, such as Pneumocystis carinii [113,114], that are typically cleared by other mechanisms. Taken together, these responses document ozone-induced changes in several dozen BAL proteins, many of which had not been previously examined in this context.",

One striking difference between the WT and SP-A KO mice was in the DEF and RED protein groups, where roughly three-fourths of the responses were greater in the KO mice. In most cases the significant ozone-induced changes in the KOO3 mice were similar to trends observed in the WTO3 mice, but the magnitude of the change was greater in the KOO3 mice than in WTO3. This is also exemplified by the PCA analysis in which the first principal component, which separated groups by ozone exposure, accounted for a greater degree of study variance (42.54%) than the second component (12.76% of study variance) which segregated KO mice from WT. This indicates both an increased sensitivity to the oxidative stress caused by ozone exposure in both WT and KO, and a more vigorous and perhaps less well-regulated response to the ozone exposure in KO mice.",

In many cases the baseline (FA-exposed) value of the KOFA mice differed from the WTFA values in a similar fashion as the WTO3 mice differed from the WTFA group. For example, lactate dehydrogenase and sec14-like 3 levels were reduced after ozone exposure and the corresponding levels in the KOFA group were similar to the WTO3 group. Following ozone exposure, the levels in the KOO3 mice were further reduced. Similarly, there were a number of cases where increases in WTO3 mice were mirrored by similar increases in the KOFA mice that were subsequently further increased by ozone as assessed by the values observed in KOO3 mice. These include apolipoprotein A-I, kininogen 1, and pregnancy zone protein, among others. The similarity between the levels of many proteins in the KOFA mice to those seen in WTO3 mice (in other words, baseline levels in the KO mice corresponded to levels induced by oxidative stress in the WT mice) led us to propose the following scenario.",

            "text": "Many of the changes in WTO3 mice are likely due to oxidative stress resulting from acute ozone exposure. We have demonstrated that SP-A is highly susceptible to oxidative modification and that its modification significantly compromises its function))[31-33,53,115-117]. In WT mice SP-A is an abundant BAL protein and several lines of evidence have linked it to redox regulation and led investigators to propose an antioxidant function for SP-A. In these papers it has been demonstrated that SP-A inhibits lipid peroxidation [101,102,116] and that it can restore function to oxidized surfactant [103]. We postulate that the reason that many proteins in the KOFA mice have levels similar to WTO3 mice is because the KOFA mice are under chronic oxidative stress due to the lack of SP-A. In our previous study of ozone exposure and SP-A KO mice we did not detect differences in glutathione levels between WT and KO mice, but we did not measure levels of the many other enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in BAL [118], nor did we investigate the possible role of compartmentalization of these antioxidants. In addition, although carbonylated protein levels were higher in WTO3 mice than in KOO3, we did not assess levels of other oxidized molecular species, such as lipid peroxidation products, whose formation is known to be inhibited by SP-A [101,102,119]. If indeed, SP-A plays an antioxidant role in WT mice by scavenging reactive species under both normal and perturbed conditions as has been previously suggested [120], its absence in the KO mice may result in increased oxidative stress, even under normal conditions. The findings in the present study support this postulate. Moreover, the lack of SP-A may contribute to an added oxidative stress following O3 exposure via the reduction in PMN recruitment as shown in this and in a previous study [8]. Thus, based on both similarities and differences in protein levels among the groups under study, it is likely that different and overlapping mechanisms are operative.",

            "text": "Using discovery proteomics and a mouse genetic model of a deficiency of an innate host defense molecule (SP-A) we have examined, for the first time using the 2D-DIGE approach, global changes in the BAL proteome of WT and KO mouse strains that occur in response to ozone exposure, an acute oxidative stress. By characterizing these protein expression changes with the broader, unbiased perspective of a \"discovery\" approach we were able to gain insight into a more complete understanding of pathophysiologic changes caused by ozone exposure. For example, the widespread decreases in RED proteins involved in redox balance suggest enhanced turnover of these proteins as a consequence of the oxidative stress resulting from ozone exposure, and the increases in PMM proteins involved in protein metabolism and modification are likely related to this increased turnover. The many changes (both increases and decreases) in proteins in the DEF group provide a possible basis for the increased susceptibility of some individuals to infection following an oxidative stress. Furthermore, the differences described in the response patterns of WT mice and SP-A KO mice provide support for a role of SP-A in innate immunity and redox balance under normal conditions (in the absence of an exogenous oxidative stress) as well as in the presence of an ozone-induced oxidative stress. Thus, based on the present findings, we submit that the sensitivity to oxidative stress in the four conditions we studied here is: KOO3 \u2265 KOFA \u2248 WTO3 \u2265 WTFA. Moreover, the susceptibility of SP-A to oxidation shown by previous studies, together with its abundance in BAL fluid, make it ideally suited to play a role as a \"sacrificial antioxidant,\" as has been described for albumin [104,105,109] and postulated for other proteins [107]. Further study is warranted to investigate the postulated mechanisms in greater detail.",
