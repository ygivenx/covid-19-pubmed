Nevertheless, explicit estimates are very scarce, except for rigorous challenge studies that helped quantify the natural history5,26; moreover, it is unclear if the natural history of experimentally infected individuals are similar to those based on natural infection. A small number of mathematical modelling studies estimated a part of the abovementioned values,27\u201330 but explicit model-based estimates of the asymptomatic ratio have yet to be offered. The present study aims to estimate the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection, reanalyzing foodborne outbreak data with laboratory testing in Japan, along with other parameters, including virus shedding frequency and the risk of infection. In addition to estimating the asymptomatic ratio for all noroviruses, the present study also compares the estimate across different genogroups and genotypes.",

Asymptomatic individuals were defined as persons without diarrhea and vomiting, and the asymptomatic ratio was defined as the proportion of asymptomatically infected individuals among the total of infected individuals. Through stool specimen tests using highly sensitive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which has the highest detection limit among all existing genome testing methods32 the virus and its genogroup/genotype were identified. Due to its highly sensitive nature, the real-time RT-PCR was shown to detect positive norovirus specimens if >10 copies were included in a well.32 Since asymptomatic healthy individuals as well as symptomatic cases were tested, the results in each outbreak are classified into four categories, ie, (i) symptomatic and virus positive, (ii) symptomatic but virus negative, (iii) asymptomatic and virus positive, and (iv) asymptomatic and virus negative. In addition to the number of people in each category for each outbreak, genotyping results were obtained. Figure 1 summarizes the survey results, and the coded data are given in eTable 1. It should be noted that the number of asymptomatic and virus-negative individuals includes both uninfected individuals and infected cases without virus shedding. The abovementioned study31 has been very rigorous, in that all individuals involved in each food-borne outbreak were fully surveyed, which has been extremely rare and not routinely attainable. In addition, such a study must employ the highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR, a condition that was also satisfied by the 2005\u20132006 study.31 Moreover, all events were observed in the same year in Japan within food handling facilities of comparable sizes.",

We assume that all situations and population were similar across outbreaks and shared identical parameters. Let p be the risk (or the probability) of norovirus infection given an exposure at food handling center, and similarly, let s be the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection, representing the probability that infected individuals escape from symptomatic illness.33 Moreover, let q be the probability of virus detection from an infected individual. While these parameters are allocated, all these processes are not directly observed in the original survey. The epidemiological information we have an access includes (i) the total number of people involved (including healthy individuals) in each outbreak, (ii) the number of symptomatic cases, and (iii) the numbers of symptomatic virus shedding cases and asymptomatic virus shedding cases. From these pieces of information, we estimate p, q and s jointly.",

In addition to original findings of similar virus shedding frequency of GII.4 between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases by Ozawa et al,31 our study underscores the important feature of GII.4 inducing asymptomatic infections among food handlers. Not only spreading the virus via food handlers, but the greater asymptomatic ratio allows infected individuals to be freely mobile and have more opportunities to pass the virus to others. When we assumed that the actual frequency of virus shedding from asymptomatic individuals is smaller than symptomatic cases, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated to be greater than the baseline. In other words, the estimated value around 30% might be even greater than our result.",

Due to the frequent circulation of GII.4, a portion of exposed individuals might have been immune in advance of outbreaks (that were not widespread before 2006 but may have remained unrecognized); moreover, evolutionary changes in GII.4 (eg, antigenic evolution) might have later varied the virus characteristics, including the infectiousness of GII.4.

That is, to define symptomatic cases, diarrhea or vomiting was employed, but they were qualitative definitions that did not explicitly involve the frequency, such as the number of defecations/vomiting per day. Such qualitative definition is favored for clearly defining what a symptomatic case is, and an important advantage of the present study is that an identical research group has conducted the entire survey and minimized the measurement of error that could potentially arise from researchers. Nevertheless, when it comes to additionally measuring the severity of illness, which is out of the scope of the present study, it might have been unavoidable to include human perception error. Such misclassification could have potentially affected the asymptomatic ratio (eg, due to broad definition of asymptomatic persons). Moreover, the exact timing of stool sampling was unavailable; however, it is likely that all sampling took place in a matter of 1 week from the onset of outbreaks, during which the virus shedding level of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases should be substantial.8 Second, the model involved a few simplifications. The simplified points include the ignorance of the dependent happening in the risk of infection. Since the majority of outbreaks were considered as purely foodborne, a single parameter p was allocated, but if human-to-human transmission was involved, it might have been better to account for that information, which was not attainable in the present study using the same dataset. Another simplification was the use of binomial sampling process for each likelihood. As a consequence, the uncertainty bound of p in the present study should be regarded as an underestimate. One of the drawbacks has been seen in significantly greater p that we obtained when two big outbreaks were removed from analysis; in other words, the estimate might not have been significantly different if the uncertainty also reflected demographic stochasticity.",
