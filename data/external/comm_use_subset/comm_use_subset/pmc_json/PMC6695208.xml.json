Epidemiological investigations traced EVD cases back to the week of April 30 and identified the initial epicenter to be Mabalako. This region of DRC (Fig 1) has over five million inhabitants, some of whom suffer from armed conflict, humanitarian crisis, and displacement to the bordering countries of Uganda and Rwanda [2]. Since the outbreak began, its magnitude has surpassed all other EVD outbreaks in DRC, becoming the second largest in history to date. As of February 25, 2019, 875 EVD cases had been reported (65 probable and 810 confirmed), and the Ministry of Health of DRC, the World Health Organization, and other organizations were responding to the Ebola outbreak [3].",

Uptake of traditional control measures such as contact tracing and safe burials has varied with the community, even with the rapid deployment and widespread availability of experimental vaccines and therapeutics [3]. Our understanding of the impact of scientific advances on EVD transmission has been evolving; there has been an underlying, untested assumption that vaccination may reduce epidemic transmission [5]. Mathematical modeling of simulated EVD epidemics suggested that vaccination coverage as low as 40% in the general population and 95% in healthcare workers (HCWs) may avert another epidemic similar to size of the West African one [6]. Studies have yet to estimate the levels of vaccination coverage associated with epidemic decline. An even greater potential problem in difficult-to-access outbreak areas is ascertainment of vaccination coverage among contacts and contacts of contacts. Mathematical models are needed that can produce relatively accurate forecasts in the setting of such unknown but important outbreak response metrics.",

Although the epidemic was officially reported on August 1 as a cluster of cases occurring in June and July, seven sporadic early cases from April and May were subsequently linked to the current outbreak and were added to later case totals [3].

To estimate the reproduction number R in past outbreaks as a function of the number of days from the beginning of the outbreak, we included reported cases by date from fourteen prior outbreaks (S1 Table), [17\u201330]. To reflect the Ebola response system in DRC during what is now its tenth outbreak, the first historical outbreak reported in each country was excluded (e.g. the 1976 outbreak in Yambuko, DRC), as there is a difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD following a country\u2019s first outbreak. We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in these outbreaks [31]. The serial interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days.",

These proposed trajectories were then filtered, by discarding all proposed trajectories except those whose cumulative case counts matched known counts of the current 2018 EVD outbreak on known dates. In earlier, smaller data sets we filtered against all reported case counts, while in later, more complete data sets we used a thinned series of case counts for filtering, for computational tractability, by selecting five case counts evenly spaced in the data set plus the final case count (S1 Fig). The filtration required an exact match of the first target value, and at subsequent target dates accepted epidemics within a number of cases more or less than each recorded value.

As larger tolerances became necessary, in data sets from after October, we introduced one further distinction: while it is possible for cumulative case counts to decrease as inaccurately classified cases are removed from the counts, due to the precision of the labeling of cases probable and confirmed we expect this to happen rarely, so we limit the tolerance of matching to only at most 15 cases below the reported count regardless of the tolerance of counts above the reported count. This limit on underestimates was applied only to analysis of data sets from later than October 13, to preserve unaltered the projection methods we reported in a preprint of this paper [34]. Filtering tolerances were as follows: when using the August 20 data set, we allowed a tolerance of 4 cases more or less than each target count; for August 27 and September 5, 6 cases; for September 15, 10 cases; for October 7, 12 cases; for October 13, 17 cases; for November 1, 41 cases; for November 20, 55 cases; for January 6, 2019, 75 cases; and for February 25, 150 cases. This one-step particle filtering technique produced an ensemble of model outbreaks, filtered on agreement with the recorded trajectory of the outbreak to date. This filtered ensemble was then used to generate projections of the outbreak in the short term (one week, two weeks, four weeks, and eight weeks) and long term (final size) [35].",

We estimated that transmission rates are higher than would be expected under target levels of 62% coverage due to contact tracing and vaccination. Under our stochastic model\u2019s assumptions, the elevated transmission rates, relative to those of past outbreaks, needed to reproduce this outbreak\u2019s epidemic trajectory are highly unlikely to be randomly observed with high vaccination coverage. This model estimate may serve as a loose proxy for the outbreak response challenges. Thus, outbreak response teams may need to consider other control and care strategies to end the outbreak. Under current circumstances, mass vaccination in regions of high prevalence or areas where the outbreak has newly arrived may be a more effective strategy to reduce EBOV transmission than ring vaccination. Aggressive supportive care, experimental therapeutics and high-quality facilities (e.g. air-conditioned, individualized) have also been described as part of the outbreak response. These interventions have the potential to improve health-seeking behaviors and possibly reduce EBOV transmission in communities that are resistant to control efforts [15], but further studies are needed.",

The relatively simple auto-regression model we used performed more consistently on the range of partial data sets used for scoring than the more complex stochastic simulation model did. The stochastic model has tended to produce tighter prediction distributions that are prone to extreme failure when they get it wrong, while the auto-regression model\u2019s predictions are more tolerant of unpredictable outcomes. Conversely, the stochastic model outperforms the auto-regression when it gets the prediction right. It should also be noted that because the stochastic simulation model is based on mechanistic knowledge of the transmission process generating the outbreak while the regression model is a purely statistical inference from past outbreaks, it may be that if conditions emerge that are substantially different from past outbreak conditions, the mechanistic model may produce sensible predictions where a purely statistical model fails. Because the other included models produce only final outbreak size projections, they can not be fully evaluated before the outbreak has ended. However, we can note that our early projections of final size (S9 and S10 Figs) fell below the counts that have been observed as of February. In other words, our forecasts based on early reports and on an assumption that past outbreaks can be used to forecast the present one were more optimistic than warranted by subsequent events. Events to come may shed light on whether this outbreak is qualitatively different than the past ones we have used to construct forecasts, perhaps due to the impact of conflict conditions on the outbreak.",

Our regression models are based entirely on past outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (measured and reported in different ways), and cannot account for the improved control measures and vaccination in the way that a mechanistic model does. We included as much real-time information in our models as possible, but situations such as the introduction of EVD into a zone of armed conflict and the recent introduction of vaccination are not reflected by the suite of past outbreaks. The stochastic model used estimated vaccination effectiveness, reported cases, and timing of onset dates affected by vaccination from studies from West Africa, not DRC, and did not include vaccination of healthcare workers. Our forecasts do not account for possible unreported cases or changes in reporting over time; such gaps in reporting can not be ruled out, though given the intense efforts at case finding that started in July and carried forward, we think it unlikely that there were large changes in reporting. Furthermore, as the outbreak moved into areas affected by violent conflict as the outbreak continued, we think it likely that case reporting, if anything, decreased over time, and therefore underreporting would not explain the apparent increase in transmission from June to October. While it would be desirable to use the vaccination coverage estimates to estimate the number of cases prevented by the vaccination program, our models were not designed to produce a testable estimate of such an effect.",

Critics suggest that Gott\u2019s rule gives misleading predictions when the phenomenon in question exhibits known time scales, such as in prediction of human lifetimes [40, 41]. Gott\u2019s rule has not been validated for epidemics, and in this case, is based on an assumption that the current case count in an epidemic occurs at a random point in its progression. For an easily detected but uncontrollable supercritical epidemic, we would expect forecasts based on the first reports to underestimate the final size. For an easily controlled epidemic, forecasts would more likely be too pessimistic, since control measures would (by assumption) swiftly end the epidemic after recognition.

The stochastic model may be sensitive to the assumption of an exponentially decaying curve for transmission rate by day, and alternative assumptions might lead to a different distribution of forecast outcomes. Indeed, all of our projections are conditional on model assumptions being met. If unpredictable events were to change patterns of EBOV transmission in ways not seen in past outbreaks, assumptions used for model projections could be violated and our results could change. For example, exceedingly improbable events such as a catastrophic outbreak (more than 10,000 cases or approaching the size of the 2013\u20132016 West Africa outbreak) might become more probable. A strength of our approach was the use of multiple methods to estimate the outbreak size, including both mechanistic modeling and purely statistical approaches.",

The predictions of our stochastic branching process and regression models reflect an assumption that this outbreak can be modeled by the ensemble of past outbreaks located in countries with previous experience responding to EVD outbreaks. This criterion of non-naive countries has the consequence of excluding the massive West African outbreak of 2013\u20132016 from the distribution of past outbreaks modeled, which may also be justifiable per se as it is a single statistical outlier. However, as the outbreak has exceeded the resulting projections, their assumptions must be called into question. In particular, the range of quenching scenarios considered by the branching process model appears to overestimate whatever damping of transmission may be occurring in the present outbreak, leading to its undersized projections of future case counts. An additional consequence of overestimating quenching is that because vaccine coverage is modeled as a reduction in transmission from the quenched rates assumed otherwise, the resulting estimates of vaccine coverage may be overly low. The ability of the non-mechanistic, data-agnostic Gott\u2019s rule projection to predict the unusually large size of this outbreak more accurately than the other models suggests that broad estimates of its kind, reflecting the true extent of ignorance imposed by the unpredictable nature of events such as this outbreak, may be valuable tools in epidemic prediction and decision support despite the natural desire to predict outcomes with more precision.",
