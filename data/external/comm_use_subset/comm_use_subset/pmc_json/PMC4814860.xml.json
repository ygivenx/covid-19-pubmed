Few patients in our study received ribavirin and/or IVIG or supportive care with supplemental oxygen, although evaluation of these patients included chest imaging in 37% and antibiotic use in 20%. The overall impact of RSV alone on receipt of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy was difficult to assess, but in this group of immunocompromised middle\u2010aged children who were likely to have previously experienced RSV infection, the immediate consequences of RSV infection were generally not severe.",

In this study, only a minority of the solid organ transplant recipients in this study were hospitalized and none died. Single institution inpatient studies have reported that RSV is the most commonly detected respiratory virus, particularly in pediatric lung transplant recipients. Pediatric abdominal transplant recipients with RSV infections have been reported to have mortality rates of 40%18, 19, 20; however, these studies have primarily described hospitalized patients. Larger studies in solid organ transplant recipients are needed to address this issue more completely.",

With several new RSV antivirals in development including two that have been evaluated in challenge studies in healthy young adults, the assessment of sequential viral loads with receipt of treatment should be assessed to correlate with clinical outcomes in this relatively high\u2010risk patient population.",
