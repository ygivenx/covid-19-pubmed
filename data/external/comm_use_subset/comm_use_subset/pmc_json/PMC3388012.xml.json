Another 11 additional Mycobacteria range from obligate parasites to free-living soil bacteria: M. leprae and M. avium subsp. Paratuberculosis K10, the causative agents of leprosy and paratuberculosis respectively, are pathogenic and require hosts to survive; M. ulcerans, M. marinum, M. avium 104, and M. abscessus have the potential to be pathogenic but can survive outside the confines of a host; M. vanbaalenii, M. sp. KMS, M. sp. MCS, and M. gilvum are free-living soil bacteria which are known to degrade a variety of compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and are useful in bioremediation efforts. Thus, the Mycobacteria included in our dataset span an ecological range from host-dependent pathogens to soil bacteria, allowing us to study multiple evolutionary transitions.",

Additional lipid metabolism genes with elevated dN/dS values include 15 genes predicted to be involved in the \u03b2-oxidation pathway of fatty acid degradation: seven fadE (acyl coA dehydrogenase) genes, three fadD (fatty acid CoA ligase) genes, two fadB (NADPH quinone oxidoreductase/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase) genes, one fadA (acetyl-CoA acyltransferase) gene, and two echA (enoyl-CoA hydratase) genes.

There are two dinB-family polymerases in Mtb (dinX and dinP). Unlike in other bacteria, dinX and dinP expression are not dependent on recA, the SOS response, or the presence of DNA damage, and could therefore serve a novel yet uncharacterized role in Mtb [46-49].",

Molybdenum cofactor is an efficient catalyst in oxygen-transfer reactions, can be used in anaerobic respiration, and can catalyze redox reactions in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism. Recently, genes related to molybdenum cofactor protein synthesis have been shown to be upregulated under conditions of stress in Mtb [52]. Molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis has been previously linked to pathogenesis. The regulator of the moa1 locus, MoaR1, was identified as having a SNP in M. bovis BCG, but not in virulent M. bovis or Mtb [53]. In addition, moa3 is present with varying frequency in the RD1 region, which is absent in M. bovis BCG, of pathogenic strains [54].",

For optimal power, the organisms being analyzed must be sufficiently distant such that non-functional elements have diverged, but not so distant such that functional elements have evolved or re-arranged. Organisms within the Mtb complex are all highly similar at the sequence level, and thus by themselves do not allow for effective phylogenetic footprinting. By leveraging the evolutionary similarity of the most distantly related Mycobacteria and Actinomycetes, we gained additional power to allow us to detect functional sequences under purifying selection, albeit only those shared by at least a majority of Mycobacteria.

Figure 5a shows the expression and conservation map for one of our predicted RNAs in the GenomeView Browser [64]. Table 6 shows a listing of the top 12 candidate RNAs. To verify a subset of these candidate small RNAs, we used Northern blot analysis on four of the top predicted regions (Methods). The results (Figure 5b) show signals corresponding to small RNAs from each of four candidates (Table 6, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 9). All transcripts were near the expected size, or slightly larger. Full-length gels are provided in Additional file 3: Figure S2. Consistent with previous work, the majority of small RNAs were seen as more than one size transcript [62]. This suggests that small RNAs might be generated by processing of larger transcripts.

We also note differences in evolutionary profiles for catabolic and anabolic lipid metabolism genes, and evidence for positive selection in lipid metabolism genes. The cis-regulatory elements bound by the KstR protein, a known regulator of lipid/cholesterol metabolism, are among the strongest, most highly conserved noncoding signals across the Mycobacteria.

By similarity of phylogenetic profiles, we can predict likely candidates for novel gene families related to pathogenicity. For example, we see similar expansions in gene families related to biosynthesis of molybdopterin. We further observe evidence of positive selection on molybdenum-related genes, providing further support for the importance of molybdenum in these pathogens. On the branch leading to the pathogenic Mycobacteria, we also observe evidence for positive selection in genes related to replication, recombination, and repair.

Previous studies indicate a possible more ancient lateral gene transfer of fatty acid biosynthesis genes from \u03b1-proteobacteria to actinobacteria [84].

SYNERGY also associates orthogroups with a gene tree, from which we can derive an \"extended phylogenetic profile\", showing the gene copy number in each extant organism and at each ancestral node. Importantly, by reconciling an organism tree with each gene tree, SYNERGY provides an evolutionary scenario for each gene tree predicting where all losses, gains, and duplications occurred in its evolution. These lists of losses, gains, and duplications contain actual evolutionary events, as well as artifacts caused by genes that could not be properly categorized by SYNERGY. However, we observe that SYNERGY is effective at properly categorizing genes into orthogroups, and the SYNERGY orthogroups were very useful in our analysis. Analysis of the 31 genomes resulted in a total of 32,505 orthogroups, including those containing single genes from only a single genome (below).

Thus we tabulated the number of genes in each genome for each category, and automatically searched for gene categories whose copy number (normalized for genome size) had the most non-uniform distribution across the 31 organisms in order to identify the most significant examples of expansions or losses. To identify categories with bimodal properties (such as a categories with a loss or a large expansion on only certain branches of the phylogenetic tree), we clustered each profile into two groups and looked for the pathways with the greatest separation between the two clusters. We used k-means (k = 2) to cluster the profile vectors, and compared the intra- and inter-cluster point-to-centroid distances to find the clusters with the greatest separation. We ranked categories by this separation to find bimodal categories. We further select those that have at least five organisms in the smallest of the two clusters, and an average of at least five genes per genome. P-values are calculated from a T-test between the values for the two groups, with Bonferroni correction applied. In our Supplementary Information website we list those categories with p < 0.05, ranked by the difference between their inter- to intra-centroid distances.

The log-likelihood model that we use here compares this branch model to the simple model with a single value of dN/dS described above, and tests whether the model allowing dN/dS to differ on the foreground branch fits the data better than the basic model.",

The process of pairwise whole-genome alignment consists of using PatternHunter [105] to identify anchors of local alignment, grouping collinear anchors separated by a limited distance into chains, filtering out smaller chains that shadow larger ones, and finally using LAGAN [106] to globally align the entire chain. Once all genomes have been aligned to the reference, we then identified intervals of the reference that map tightly to a single interval of some or all of the target genomes, and we consider these the endpoints of blocks of multiple alignment. These blocks are generally smaller than any precursor pairwise alignment, because a rearrangement or loss of detectable similarity in any genome will truncate the block for all member genomes. We then ran the multiple aligner MLAGAN on each block. Finally, to facilitate searches for constrained regions of the reference, we projected the blocks onto the reference genome, effectively unwinding all genome rearrangements in the target genomes relative to the reference. We visualized the alignments in the GenomeView browser [64].",

The multiple alignment is shown on the bottom (darker grey signifies a higher degree of conservation; red signifies no alignment at that position). You can see that this predicted RNA region is conserved through M. avium. The rulers at the top show the gene structure. Small red squares show where stop codons are present all six reading frames, indicating that this intergenic region is unlikely to be a protein-coding region missed in the annotation. b) Northern blots validating four of the new, predicted small RNAs (RNA1, RNA2, RNA3, and RNA9 in Table 6).",
