Some commentators compared it with that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the outbreak in 2003. What was it really like? As of 26 August 2017, the influenza activity in Hong Kong had further declined from the peak and returned to the baseline, indicating that the 2016\u20132017 influenza season is over. From 5 May to 26 August, 586 severe seasonal influenza cases were recorded, including 19 pediatric cases (aged below 18). Among them, 429 adults and 3 children had died. Hospitalization rates were high, especially for the elderly (aged \u2a7e65). H3N2 was the predominating subtype detected.",

It remains to be validated whether the predominant H3N2 viruses in this season have undergone antigenic drifts that reduce vaccine effectiveness, as seen in the 2014\u20132015 season. It is noteworthy that more than 35% of the H3N2 viruses found in May 2017 in Hong Kong contain N121K mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which could render the vaccine less effective.2 To what extent this might have exacerbated the severity of this influenza season in Hong Kong merits further investigations. Since 45.4% of the fatal cases are known to have received the influenza vaccine for the 2016\u20132017 season, the possibility that vaccination cannot effectively protect infection with the circulating H3N2 viruses cannot be excluded.",

Whereas seasonal influenza activity peaked in February and March in the previous three seasons, with an exceptional second wave seen in June 2015, it plateaued in July 2017. Consistent with the notion that H3N2 is more virulent, there were more severe cases and deaths in 2014\u20132015 than in 2013\u20132014 or 2015\u20132016. In contrast, the numbers of severe and death cases in the peak week were similar for 2014\u20132015 and 2016\u20132017. The 2016\u20132017 season is drawing to a close at the end of August; the total number of severe and death cases does not exceed that of 2014\u20132015 (Table 1).

For example, in the H3N2-dominant 2003\u20132004 season, the estimated number of influenza-associated deaths with underlying respiratory and circulatory causes in the United States was 48 614.3 The advanced influenza surveillance system in Hong Kong has just provided a real-life example in support of the estimation made by the CDC.",

Hence, a comparison of numbers between different regions cannot reflect the severity of seasonal influenza activity. Human infection of avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses has a case fatality of 60% and 40%, respectively. Likewise, about of 10% of cases with SARS and 30% of cases with Middle East respiratory syndrome are fatal. These are emerging viral pathogens with unusual properties. If seasonal influenza is a known evil, they are unknown beasts. Direct comparison of the numbers of deaths caused by seasonal influenza and these emerging viruses is therefore misleading.",

Reducing the disease burden and the impact on public hospitals in Hong Kong is our next challenge. The percentage of people in the high-risk groups, including children, the elderly and health professionals, in Hong Kong who receive influenza vaccination is relatively low. Providing more incentives, including more attractive subsidizing schemes, to these groups might be helpful. Prescribing Tamiflu to the elderly who are at higher risk has also been shown to be a safe and effective prophylactic measure. Earlier concerns about the possibility that exposing more people to Tamiflu might accelerate the development of drug resistance can be relieved.4 Nevertheless, seasonal influenza will still keep us busy in the years to come. New types of vaccines and antivirals are required in our battle against influenza viruses.",
