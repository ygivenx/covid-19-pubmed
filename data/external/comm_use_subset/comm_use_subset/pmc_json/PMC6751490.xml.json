Although droplet infection is most frequent, contact infection is also an important infection route (1, 4\u20136). Hand hygiene is a commonly used method for prevention of contact infection and is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) (7\u201310). There are two recognized techniques for performing hand hygiene: antiseptic hand rubbing (AHR) with alcohol-based disinfectants, such as 80% (wt/wt) ethanol-based disinfectants (EBDs), and antiseptic hand washing (AHW) (11).",

Since organic matter contained in hand dirt or body fluids may reduce EBD effectiveness, methods and standards for evaluating disinfectant efficacy by adding organic matter as a load material have been established by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) (17\u201320).

Disinfectant effectiveness against bacteria in biofilms decreases due to the physical factors of biofilms (23\u201325). Because mass transfer is limited in biofilms (26, 27), a disinfectant solution takes a long time to reach the center of a biofilm. Therefore, bacteria in biofilms are protected from disinfectants and survive longer (26, 28\u201330). Human mucus, including sputum, is a viscoelastic substance that shares physical properties with biofilms (31). Therefore, mucus may also protect IAV from disinfectants due to its physical properties.",

In fact, measurement of the ethanol concentration in saline and mucus revealed that the time required for the ethanol concentration to reach 31% (i.e., the minimum concentration at which IAV is completely inactivated) throughout the mucus was approximately eight times longer than that in saline; this positively correlated with IAV inactivation time. Taken together, these findings revealed that ECIR in infectious mucus was considerably low; this was because of decreased diffusion and convection phenomena due to the unique physical properties (particularly the high viscosity) of infectious mucus, which caused prolongation of the time required for EBD to exert its disinfecting effects on IAV in infectious mucus.",

Therefore, disinfectants (and disinfection methods) produced and approved using the currently recommended process can be insufficient for disinfection of infectious mucus, and deviations can occur between the expected effects and the actual clinical effects (7\u201310, 17\u201320). A disinfectant effectiveness assessment test under conditions reproducing the physical properties of infectious mucus should be added to the current assessment standards for disinfectant effectiveness.

In fact, IAV both in dried mucus and in dried saline was rapidly inactivated within 30 s after exposure to EBD in both in vitro and in situ inactivation tests. For infectious mucus that is completely dried on fingers, EBDs exert IAV-inactivating effects in a short time (within 30 s), as conventionally recognized.

First, regarding the AHW regimens in this study, handwashing was practiced using running water only, without using plain or antiseptic soap. These AHW regimens were expected to have a lower pathogen inactivation effect compared to that of AHW regimens using plain or antiseptic soap. However, IAV on the fingers was completely inactivated within 30 s under all AHW conditions, showing a good IAV inactivation effect of AHW in this study. Therefore, this limitation did not affect the results and conclusions of this study. Second, the additional fluid simulation was performed with the mucus (sample no. 10) viscosity reduced to 16.7 or 12.5% of the measured value (Fig. 6; Fig. S4A). In the initial simulation of mucus conditions using the measured mucus viscosity, the time required for regions containing <31% ethanol to disappear exceeded 120 s. Times exceeding 120 s are not realistic, because the calculation time and costs are dramatically increased in the additional simulation reproducing the reaction conditions of the ethanol concentration measurement and the inactivation tests more faithfully. Therefore, the additional fluid simulation was performed with the mucus viscosity reduced. The result of the initial simulation under the same low-viscosity conditions (12.5 and 16.7% of the measured value) was as with the additional simulation (Fig. S4D); the results of actual measurement of ethanol concentrations in low-viscosity mucus (Fig. S4C) were generally compatible with the results of the additional simulation (Fig. S4A). The validity of the additional fluid simulation was confirmed, and it was demonstrated that the physical properties of mucus greatly affect the increase of ethanol concentration in mucus. Third, to estimate the time required for saline or mucus to completely dry up, the time required for samples to completely dry up on a glass plate was measured in an indoor environment. In the future, it will be necessary to establish a method for measuring the complete drying time of infectious mucus on human skin. Depending on the results of the future study, the complete drying time may vary slightly from a minimum of \u201c30 min,\u201d as shown in this study.",

All NMR measurements were conducted using a Diff-30 diffusion probe on a Bruker Avance 600 spectrometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operating at a 1H resonance frequency of 600.13 MHz. The chemical shifts were calibrated using the 1H resonance of tetramethylsilane as an external reference. PFG-NMR self-diffusion measurements were carried out using the pulsed-gradient spin-echo sequence, starting from the minimum value of 0.05 midpoint temperature (Tm\u22121). The maximum gradient strength was adjusted experimentally to 2.0 to 3.0 Tm\u22121 to maximize the accuracy of fitting from signal attenuation. The diffusion time (\u0394) was fixed to 20 ms, and the gradient-pulse duration (\u03b4) was set to 1 ms. For all samples, 5-mm NMR glass tubes were used; the tubes were sealed to prevent evaporation of the solvent. In total, eight signal averages were acquired for each gradient increment (g) for a total of 16 increments.

The digital ethanol densitometer is a refractometer that measures the ethanol concentration at the center of a sample placed on a prism in a hemispherical region with a diameter of \u223c1 mm; this enables measurement of changes in ethanol concentration over time in the region of the sample with the lowest ethanol concentration. For this manual procedure, 95 \u03bcl of EBD was added as slowly as possible to a 5-\u03bcl sample placed on a prism. The densitometer was then used for measurement of the ethanol concentration over time. A fitting curve was prepared from the ethanol concentration at each time point, and the time for the ethanol concentration to reach 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 31, 35, and 40% was calculated from the fitting curve.

The physical properties of the sample (no. 10) with a median viscosity among all 19 mucus samples were adopted as the physical properties of the mucus used in the simulation. In the initial simple simulation of mucus conditions using the measured viscosity of mucus, the time required for regions containing <31% ethanol to disappear exceeded 120 s. Times exceeding 120 s are not realistic because the calculation time and cost are dramatically increased. Therefore, fluid simulation was performed with the mucus (sample no. 10) viscosity reduced to 16.7 or 12.5% of the measured value.",
