In the history of Homo sapiens sapiens, a particularly important event that triggered a new and striking gene-culture-coevolution cycle was the development of agriculture and animal domestication during the Neolithic period (\u223c10,000 years ago). Further, the human gene-culture coevolution mediated by the domestication of plants and animals has been argued to provide some of the clearest and most spectacular examples of niche construction. The Niche Construction Theory can be defined as a branch of evolutionary biology that emphasizes on the ability of organisms to modify the pressure of natural selection in their environment and thereby act as co-directors of their own evolution, as well as that of other directly associated species [3]\u2013[6].",

            "text": "Although more than 100 regions/genes had been identified as the likely targets of recent positive selection resulting from cultural pressures in newly constructed niches [1], well-documented examples are scarce. One of the best-known cases of gene-culture coevolution is lactase persistence (LP; the ability of adult humans to digest the lactose found in fresh milk) and dairying. High frequencies of LP are generally observed in traditional pastoralist populations. For example, LP reaches \u223c64% in Beni Amir pastoralists from Sudan, whereas its frequency in a neighboring non-pastoralist community is only \u223c20%. In Europe, LP varies from 15\u201354% in eastern and southern regions, 62\u201386% in central and western regions, and 89\u201396% in northern regions [5], [7]\u2013[13]. Multiple independent mutations have been associated with this characteristic, some of which are located in an intron of the MCM6 gene, a region fundamental to lactase expression [5], [14]. The alleles that led to lactose persistence in Europe, such as MCM6 13,910*T, first underwent selection among dairying farmers around 7,500 years ago, possibly in association with the dissemination of the Neolithic Linearbandkeramik culture over Central Europe [13]. The high copy number variation of the amylase gene and the spread of the corresponding alleles in agricultural societies are another well-studied example [7], [8], [11], [15], [16]. Additionally, the West African Kwa-speaking agriculturalists cut and clear the forest to grow yams, increasing the amount of standing water after rain, therefore providing better breeding grounds for malaria-carrying mosquitoes [1] favoring the HbS allele, which confers protection against malaria in heterozygous individuals [17].",

Salzano were pioneers in identifying complex population processes highly dependent on cultural factors in Native Americans (e.g., fission-fusion dynamic; [18]). Other examples are related to the coevolution of genes and languages [19], [20], but only two more recently reported examples might be associated with positive selection: (1) Tovo-Rodrigues et al.\n[21] investigated the distribution of D4 dopamine receptor (DRD4) alleles in several South Amerindian populations and found a significant difference in the allelic distributions between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists, with an increase of the 7R allele among the former; and (2) Acu\u00f1a-Alonzo et al. [22] showed that the 230Cys allele (Arg230Cys, rs9282541) of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene, which was previously associated with low HDL-cholesterol levels and obesity-related comorbidities, was exclusively present in Native American and mestizo individuals. These authors verified that cells expressing the ABCA1*230Cys allele showed a 27% cholesterol efflux reduction, confirming that this Native American autochthonous variant has a functional effect in vitro. Other investigations have shown that the presence of ABCA1*230Cys explains almost 4% of the variation in plasma HDL-C concentrations in Mexican admixed populations [23]. This variation in HDL-C concentration was the highest one associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) among different continental populations in these genome-wide association studies, corroborating its functionality [23].",

This study provides an example of the \u201cthrifty\u201d genotype hypothesis, which postulates that variants that increase the efficiency of energy use and storage during periods of famine would have been positively selected in prehistoric times but can be associated with diseases of affluence in contemporary societies, where food is usually abundant [24].",

The populations were clustered according to their geographical location and ancient mode of subsistence as follows: (1) Mesoamerican agriculturalists, (2) Andean agriculturalists, and (3) South American hunter-gatherers/foragers. Of course, caution is needed regarding this classification, since subsistence modes are not stable over time and may not be unique.

In this model, demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations [38]. Thus, a p value can be estimated from the joint distribution for the population heterozygosity (He) and FST using a kernel density estimation procedure [30]. The analysis was performed using Arlequin 3.5.1 in consideration of 126 Native Americans whose results for the ABCA1*230 locus were known. Data from 20 other autosomal SNPs (rs6559725, rs11140096, rs4877767, rs4014024, rs11140109, rs7872891, rs7850633, rs17086298, rs10746709, rs5014093, rs10868019, rs11140116, rs3860938, rs3860941, rs4097644, rs9942844, rs12551103, rs7863524, rs4877785, and rs70439590) from these same individuals were compiled from a major SNP panel (Table S2). These 20 additional SNPs were selected based on their location (chromosome 9: from position 85252250 to 85317359) inside the putative neutral region, defined by Schroeder and colleagues [39], which comprises \u223c76,000 bp around the D9S1120 locus. Using this database (Table S2 and Figure S1), we were able to evaluate whether the joint distribution of the observed He and FST for the ABCA1*230 polymorphism data departed from the expected outcome at neutrality. Fifty thousand coalescent simulations were performed with a 100-demes island model. Four comparative analyses were conducted: (1) Mesoamerican agriculturalists (n = 68) vs. Andean agriculturalists (n = 35), (2) Mesoamerican agriculturalists vs. South American hunter-gatherers/foragers (n = 23), (3) Mesoamerican agriculturalists vs. South Americans (agriculturalists + hunter-gatherers/foragers), and (4) Andean agriculturalists vs. South American hunter-gatherer/foragers.",

Pollen samples taken from sediments in lakes, swamps, and archeological deposits have provided evidence for the presence or absence of Zea (maize and/or teosinte) in the Americas and have been used to estimate the age of maize domestication and dispersion [44]. Blake [44] summarized the Zea pollen dates from several American archeological sites, and we selected this data set to perform our analysis. To test the connection between maize culture and the ABCA1*230Cys variant, we used allele frequencies from Mesoamerica/Central America populations (Zapotec, Maya, Nahuatl,Kaqchikel-Quiche, Totonac, Cabecar, and Guaym\u00ed) as well as Zea pollen dates obtained in archeological sites located geographically near these populations (Table 2). Spearman rank order correlations between the two data sets (Zea pollen archeological records and ABCA1*230Cys allele frequencies) were obtained using the Statistica 7.0 software (StatSoft, Inc\u00a9).",

Considering that both genomic regions were studied using the same quantity of markers and the same sampling strategy, in populations that were subjected to the same demographic history, the observed differences may occur due to diverse factors, one of them being natural selection. To test this hypothesis each dataset, summarized by the above-mentioned statistics, was also compared to each of 100,000 neutral simulations by means of Euclidian distances. The empirical dataset containing the ABCA1*230 polymorphism presented a poorer fit to neutrality than the putative neutral region dataset, showing Euclidian distances that were twofold higher than those of the neutral simulations (70.64 vs. 35.12). Interestingly, when the Mesoamerican agriculturalist subdivision was excluded from the analysis, this difference dramatically decreased (45.80 vs. 35.12). Thus, the poor fit to neutrality observed at the ABCA1*230 site and its flanking regions may be associated with the genetic pattern found in Mesoamerica.",

            "text": "Other crops were also present in the pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations (squash and beans; [50], [59]), but maize was the dietary base for most of these civilizations. For example, Benedict and Steggerda [60] showed that 75% of the calories consumed by the Mayas were derived from maize. In addition, Mesoamerica was the only region in the world where an ancient civilization lacked a domesticated herbivore. Therefore, protein from domesticated animal sources would have been scarce in Pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica in comparison to other parts of the ancient urbanized world, including the Andes [61]. As a whole, these studies demonstrated that the diet of the first Mesoamerican sedentary communities was extremely dependent on maize. These early farmers, however, suffered periods of plantation loss, questioning the common assumption that farming and sedentary lifestyle brought increased dietary stability and health homeostasis [62]. Several studies have revealed that homeostasis should have declined with sedentary farming, and bioarcheologists and paleopathologists have also detected a deterioration in Mesoamerican health indices from \u223c8,000 to \u223c500 years before present-YBP ([63] and references therein). Domestic crops are more vulnerable than wild ones, crowding promotes crop diseases, and storage systems often fail (estimates suggest that as much as 30% of stored food is lost even in a modern sophisticated system [62]). In other study, based on the molecular analysis of dietary diversity for three archaic Native Americans, Poinar et al. [64] found evidence that, as compared to individuals dependent on agriculture, the diet of hunter-gatherers seems to have been more varied and nutritionally sound. Clearly, a diet based on one or only a few crops should have been deleterious to health in the pre-Columbian era [65]. These different lines of evidence illustrate that the incipient farming niches of Mesoamerica, when communities of hunters/gatherers/foragers started to cultivate and domesticate wild plants, could have been remarkably unstable like those of other pre-industrial societies [6].",

The strong correlation between maize culture propagation and 230Cys frequencies in this region reinforces this suggestion, even when considering that the advantage of the allele may have been lost after technological innovations had been implemented and agricultural production stabilized. Peng et al.\n[66] presented evidence for a similar case of gene-culture coevolution, suggesting that positive selection for the ADH1B*47His allele was caused by the emergence and expansion of rice domestication in East Asia.",

            "text": "Noteworthy is that other environmental factors may also have been involved in the distribution of the ABCA1 alleles, since cholesterol plays an important role in various infectious processes, such as the entry and replication of Dengue virus type 2 and flaviviral infection [67]. Additionally, the ABCA1 transporter participates in infectious and/or thrombotic disorders involving vesiculation, since homozygous ABCA1 gene deletions confer complete resistance against cerebral malaria in mice [68], [69]. These findings can be considered as additional causal factors to the ABCA1*230Cys selective sweep associated with agricultural development. A sedentary village lifestyle with a corresponding growth in the density of the local population can promote an increase in the mortality rate, particularly in children under 5 years of age [70]. For example, archeological and paleoecological evidence in Europe showed that during the Neolithic demographic transition, the causes of increased infant mortality would have included a lack of drinking water supplies, contamination by feces, emergence of highly virulent zoonoses, as well as an increase in the prevalences of other germs such as Rotavirus and Coronavirus (causing diarrhea, one of the main killers of children under 5 years of age), Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Plasmodium (P. falciparum and P. vivax, which are believed to have emerged more recently), and Herpesvirus\n[70]. However, the real impact of the ABCA1*230Cys variant in these infectious processes will require additional functional studies.",

For instance, maize arrived in South America, but apparently the level of consumption seen in Mesoamerica/Central America was rarely found there. Archaeological data indicate that only during the implantation and expansion of the Inca Empire (800\u2013500 YBP) was the level of maize consumption important, but the level of consumption was not comparable to that of Mesoamerica/Central America [71]\u2013[73]. Additionally, South Amerindian hunter-gatherers/foragers present lower intrapopulation genetic variation and higher levels of population structure when compared to those seen in Andean populations [27], [74]. This same tendency was also observed in the present study. These results indicate low levels of gene flow between villages/populations and low effective population sizes, favoring the role of genetic drift. Conversely, the Andean groups show opposing characteristics. These findings correlate well with distinguishing patterns of gene flow and historical effective sizes in these indigenous populations, with cultural differences, as well as with paleoclimatic and environment changes in their habitats [74]. Therefore, the significant role of random processes and/or more heterogeneous cultural and ecological scenarios makes it difficult to define a particular pattern associated with the Arg230Cys polymorphism in South American groups, a situation different from that in Mesoamerica.",
