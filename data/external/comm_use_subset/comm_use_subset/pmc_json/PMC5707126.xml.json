            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of unknown cause, which affects the brain and spinal cord of about 400,000 individuals in the U.S. A number of viral infections of the CNS can lead to demyelination, including distemper (dogs), measles (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE, humans), and influenza (humans). [1]. Viruses have long been suspected as causative agents of MS, based on the epidemiology of the disease including geographic patterns, isolated outbreaks, and migration studies [2\u20135]. Novel viruses that cause human disease continue to be discovered including hepatitis C (1989), corona virus NL63 (2004), bocavirus (2005), and rhinovirus C group (2007) [6\u20139]. Novel human polyoma and arena viruses were recently identified as causes of serious human diseases by deep sequencing [10\u201312]. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society itself provides an excellent rationale for the search for viruses in MS and related diseases [13].",

Specimens were studied from 11 persons with primary progressive MS (PPMS), one with secondary progressive MS (SPMS), and 2 persons with severe progressive neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Progressive MS and NMO cases were specifically selected because these tend to be the most severe subtypes of the MS-related diseases. Fourteen normal control and 5 frozen encephalitis brain specimens these resources were also studied. Two additional de-identified frozen encephalitis specimens were obtained from Dr. Don Gilden at the University of Colorado, Denver. The specimens were collected post-mortem within one day of death, either fresh frozen or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and were associated with a neuropathologic diagnosis. The research plan was submitted to the University of Utah Health Sciences IRB for review. This research was reviewed and approved by the University of Utah Health Sciences IRB, #00028658.

Sheep have been used to study the evolution of ERVs within a mammalian host due to the presence of related exogenous and endogenous retroviruses. The exogenous (i.e., horizontally transmitted) oncogenic retrovirus, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), causes fatal lung cancers. A closely related provirus, JSRV-20, entered the host genome within the last 3 million years during speciation within the genus Ovis. Endogenous JSRV has a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype that blocks the replication of the closely related exogenous JSRV [46\u201348]. That is, the expression of an endogenous retrovirus effectively blocks a fatal infection with an exogenous retrovirus. This animal data strongly suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections. Support for this concept in humans is displayed by the increased expression of (endogenous) HERV-K in patients infected with the (exogenous) retrovirus HIV, where HERV-K envelope is neuroprotective [49,50].",

Qubit analysis of extracted brain specimens revealed that 1\u20135% of the analyzed material is DNA retained from the original sample. Prior to sequencing, the RNA were also analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer Nanochip (Agilent Technologies, USA) and evaluated for RNA size, abundance and integrity. This provided relatively high quality RNA for the subsequent analysis, but it cannot be determined with absolute certainty that retained DNA did not affect the results of the study. Another limitation of the study is the post-mortem interval necessarily associated with these samples obtained from deceased human donors. While there was no detectable difference in the PMI between the demyelination and control specimens, this interval likely allowed some RNA to degrade in all the samples. This likely did interfere with the detection of HERV and other retroviral sequences during the sequencing reactions.",
