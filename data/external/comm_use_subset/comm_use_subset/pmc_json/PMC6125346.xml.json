The recent emergence of a SARS-like CoV called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus has underscored the need to understand the mechanisms behind CoV pathogenicity2. SARS presents with flu-like symptoms that can progress to respiratory failure secondary to immunopathologic injury3,4. Pathologic examination of lung tissue from fatal cases shows diffuse alveolar damage, significant monocyte\u2013macrophage infiltration, and elevated serum cytokines3,5,6. A study in mouse models highlighted the importance of inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs) in SARS pathogenesis7, as high initial viral titer along with delayed type I interferon induction results in the recruitment and aberrant activation of IMMs. Deletion of the interferon receptor or IMMs rescued pathologic elevation of these cytokines post-infection and prevented lethal infection in mouse models, underscoring that patient death is likely due to a combination of an aberrant innate immune response and direct cytopathic effects of the virus7.",

            "text": "While the contributions of IMMs to disease pathogenesis is now understood, the molecular mechanisms behind their aberrant inflammatory state is not. The SARS-CoV genome encodes eight accessory proteins designated open reading frame (ORF)-3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b8. Several ORF functions have been identified: ORF-7a activates NF-\u03baB;9 ORF3b upregulates the expression of several cytokines and chemokines;10,11 ORF-6 reduces IFN production;12 ORF-8a triggers cellular apoptosis;13 and ORF-8b reduces viral replication14. ORF-9b targets the MAVS signalosome to trigger the degradation of MAVS, TRAF3, and TRAF6, severely limiting the host cell IFN response15. However, in apparent contradiction with the severe inflammatory phenotype important in SARS pathogenesis, the SARS-CoV accessory proteins thus far have primarily been implicated in apoptotic (non-inflammatory) cell death. Cells undergoing apoptosis show morphological apoptotic hallmarks of cell shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation16, which limits the inflammatory response by neatly containing dying cells for clearance by macrophages17,18. Necrotic cell death is inflammatory in nature due to the release of intracellular contents and is morphologically characterized by a gain in cell volume, organelle swelling, and plasma membrane rupture18,19.",

            "text": "Recent advances have discovered multiple pathways of programmed necrosis, including necroptosis and pyroptosis. Necroptosis is a caspase-independent form of programmed necrosis mediated by the Rip1\u2013Rip3\u2013MLKL signaling axis. Activated Rip3 phosphorylates MLKL, inducing its oligomerization, membrane insertion, and pore formation20. Pyroptosis is another form of inflammatory cell death following inflammasome activation; it allows the release of proinflammatory damage associated molecular patterns21. Inflammasome activation occurs when pathogenic molecules or cell stress activates the inflammasome sensor proteins, which then form a multimeric complex that directly activates caspase-1, allowing the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to its mature form22. Activated caspase-1 also cleaves the effector molecule Gasdermin D, which oligomerizes and inserts into the plasma membrane to form pores23. Importantly, both forms of inflammatory cell death share a similar final effector step, namely the insertion of an oligomerized protein with channel functionality into the plasma membrane.",

            "text": "Rip3 mediates necroptosis by phosphorylating MLKL, resulting in its oligomerization and membrane insertion. SARS 3a has three transmembrane segments, allowing it to form a potassium-sensitive channel when oligomerized24. Based on the shared ability of MLKL and SARS 3a to oligomerize and insert into membranes, we addressed whether Rip3 could target SARS 3a to drive necrotic cell death. To assay necrotic cell death, we concomitantly monitored cellular ATP (which is depleted during death) and the release of cytosolic proteases (which increases with necrosis)27. To parse out contributions from components of the necroptotic pathway, we used 293T and HeLa cells in parallel, as 293T cells do not express endogenous Rip3 or MLKL, while HeLa cells express MLKL but not Rip328. Overexpression of SARS 3a in 293T or HeLa cells alone did not cause significant ATP depletion or the release of cellular proteases. Similarly, expression of Rip3 in 293T cells expectedly did not cause necrotic cell death due to the lack of necroptosis effector MLKL. However, co-expression of SARS 3a and Rip3 caused substantial necrotic death that was unaffected by the addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting Rip3 helps SARS 3a cause necrotic death in a caspase-independent manner (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figure 1). To directly observe cell death, we transfected Rip3-mCherry into HeLa cells expressing SARS 3a-GFP and recorded the cell death process by time-lapse confocal microscopy. The images show that expression of Rip3 drives cell death in the presence of SARS 3a. As a control, a neighboring cell which did not express SARS 3a and Rip3 was captured and clearly survives the duration of imaging (Fig. 1b, video 1). The above functional results encouraged us to determine if SARS 3a and Rip3 interact by immunoprecipitation. After expression of SARS 3a-flag and Rip3-Myc in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated SARS 3a-flag pulls down Rip3-Myc, whereas SARS 3a and Rip3-Myc cannot be detected from immunoprecipitation using mock antibody beads (Fig. 1c). Mapping of the interaction between Rip3 and SARS 3a showed that the kinase domain of Rip3 (1\u2013326) interacted with SARS 3a, but that the RHIM motif containing C-terminus (327\u2013518) interacted very weakly (Fig. 1d).",

Using immunoblotting to detect SARS 3a oligomerization, we found that expression of both wild-type Rip3 and its kinase dead form increased SARS 3a oligomerization (2.75\u00d7 and 2.54\u00d7, respectively); the addition of DTT completely erases the oligomerization, indicating it is disulfide bond dependent as seen in previous studies24. As a parallel experiment, the oligomerization assay was done in cells treated with a protein crosslinker. When samples were heated at 65 \u00b0C, SARS 3a oligomerization increases 1.53\u00d7 and 1.25\u00d7 after transfection of WT and kinase dead Rip3, while heating samples to 100 \u00b0C abrogated detectable oligomerization (Fig. 2e). We note that the oligomerization-deficient mutant causes some cell death (Fig. 2a, b), due to either residual oligomerization activity of the mutant or cell death by the monomer. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that Rip3-driven oligomerization of SARS 3a plays a critical role in driving necrotic cell death, but that Rip3 kinase activity is dispensible.",

Addition of an MLKL inhibitor did not reduce necrotic cell death driven by the co-expression of Rip3 and SARS 3a (Fig. 3a). This is consistent with our earlier data showing cell death in 293T cells following expression of Rip3 and SARS 3a (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, expression of SARS 3a reduced phosphorylation of both transfected Rip3 and endogenous MLKL (Fig. 3b). The assayed phosphorylation sites of Rip3 and MLKL are indicators of necroptotic signaling27,29. Although SARS 3a interacts with Rip3 and Rip3 enhances oligomerization of SARS 3a causing necrotic cell death, this appears to be independent from, and may even partially inhibit Rip3-MLKL necroptotic signaling. Thus, given that SARS 3a can insert into membranes and act as an ion channel24, our data suggest that SARS 3a may hijack host cell necroptotic machinery and directly act as a necrotic cell death effector regulated by Rip3.",

Rip3 is suppressed in most cancer cell lines by DNA methylation, and treatment with hypomethylating agents such as 5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-AD) induces Rip3 expression and sensitizes these cells to necroptosis inducing stimuli30. Previous reports have shown that the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 is resistant to the traditional necroptotic stimulus (TNF-\u03b1 + caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK + Smac-mimetic BV6), and that treatment with 5-AD induces endogenous Rip3 expression30. To validate this system, we first treated A459 cells with 5-AD or DMSO, followed by immunoblotting for Rip3. As expected, Rip3 was undetectable in the DMSO-treated cells, but clearly induced by 5-AD (Fig. 4a). Consistently, DMSO-treated cells showed very little cell death after TNF-\u03b1 + Z-VAD-FMK + Smac-mimetic treatment as assayed by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, red color) staining, while 5-AD treated cells under the same conditions showed significant cell death (~50%) (Fig. 4b). We next transfected DMSO- or 5-AD-treated A549 cells with GFP-vector, SARS 3a-GFP, or SARS 3a C133A-GFP and imaged them live after 7-AAD staining. In the DMSO-treated cells, transfection of SARS 3a-GFP or its mutant did not induce cell death to a greater extent than the control. However, transfection of SARS 3a-GFP induced significant cell death in 5-AD-treated cells, while cell death was reduced almost to basal levels in SARS 3a C133A-GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 4c, d). Taken together, these data suggest that SARS 3a does not induce cell death in the absence of Rip3, but induces significant oligomerization-dependent death in the presence of endogenous Rip3.",

Confocal imaging showed that co-expressed SARS 3a and Rip3 co-localize with LAMP1, but that Rip3 only minimally localizes to the lysosome without SARS 3a (Fig. 5a). Consistently, quantification of colocalization between Rip3 and LAMP1 by Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient (PCC) showed an increase from 0.153 basally to 0.435 after co-transfection with SARS 3a (Fig. 5a), indicating that SARS 3a likely targets Rip3 to lysosomes, SARS 3a alone localized with LAMP1 (Fig. 5b) (PCC = 0.330, 34% SARS 3a-GFP and 42% LAMP1-mCherry colocalizing). To test whether SARS 3a causes lysosome damage, we monitored Galectin 3, which forms puncta on the lysosome after lysosomal membrane permeabilization31. Co-transfection of RFP-Galectin 3 and SARS 3a-GFP showed significantly more Galectin-3 puncta per cell than the control GFP-vector (Fig. 6a, b). We note SARS 3a and Galectin 3 colocalized (PCC = 0.339), indicating that the lysosome damage is SARS 3a specific (Fig. 6c). To validate that SARS 3a causes lysosomal damage, we assayed the lysosomal degradation capacity of SARS 3a-transfected cells using DQ-BSA red dye, which fluoresces after activation by lysosomal proteases. Cells expressing SARS 3a-GFP had dramatically decreased DQ-BSA red stain compared with the GFP-vector control (Fig. 6d), and intensity analysis from several images confirmed that SARS 3a-GFP-positive cells showed a significant decrease of the DQ-BSA stain (Fig. 6e). Finally, to test whether lysosomal cathepsins were released into the cytoplasm from SARS 3a-damaged lysosomes, we transfected a cytoplasmic cathepsin substrate Bid and assayed Bid cleavage by immunoblot. Expression of SARS 3a induced cleavage of Bid, which was reversed by the addition of the cathepsin inhibitors E64D and pepstatin A (Fig. 6f). These data indicate that SARS 3a causes lysosomal membrane permeablization and the release of cathepsins from lysosomes, resulting in impaired lysosomal degradation capacity.",

Consistenly, confocal microscopy of cells expressing SARS 3a-GFP and TFEB-mCherry showed that SARS 3a-GFP induced TFEB-mCherry nuclear translocation, but that a control GFP-vector did not (Fig. 7b, c).",

In the presence of SARS 3a, it took 30 min to translocate all detectable TFEB into the nucleus (Fig. 7d, video 2). Under normal conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and sequestered in the cytoplasm. The phosphatase activity of calcineurin (PPP3CB) is essential in dephosphorylating TFEB to promote its nuclear translocation35. To address whether PPP3CB mediates SARS 3a-induced TFEB nuclear translocation, we used cyclosporine (a calcineurin inhibitor) and PPP3CB siRNA and found that both reduced SARS 3a-induced TFEB nuclear translocation (Fig. 7e, f). We next checked whether SARS 3a mediated TFEB nuclear translocation-induced TFEB target gene expression. qRT-PCR of LAMP1 and p62 showed increased transcript levels compared to the vector, while the SARS 3a C133A mutant did not induce those genes (Fig. 7g). Similarly, immunoblot analysis of LAMP1 and p62 confirmed increase in protein levels after SARS 3a transfection, but less induction after expression of the SARS 3a C133A mutant (Fig. 7h). Collectively, SARS 3a oligomerization induces TFEB nuclear translocation, activation, and induction of TFEB target genes via PPP3CB.",

Potassium efflux is the most upstream shared signaling event across various NLRP3 activators, and NEK7 is an essential downstream kinase that mediates NLRP3 inflammasome assembly36. Given the ability of SARS 3a to act as a potassium channel24, we tested whether SARS 3a triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome. Using an NLRP3 inflammasome reconstitution system in 293T cells, expression of SARS 3a induced approximately twice as much caspase-1 activation and mature IL-1\u03b2 formation than the control vector. To determine whether SARS 3a functioned upstream of NEK7 (which is directly downstream of potassium efflux), we knocked down NEK7 in the presence of SARS 3a. Compared to transfection of SARS 3a with control shRNA, NEK7 knockdown resulted in reduced cleaved caspase-1 and less mature IL-1\u03b2, confirming that SARS 3a acts upstream to NEK7 (Fig. 8a). We then transfected SARS 3a into Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) differentiated Thp-1 macrophages, and observed the release of endogenous cleaved caspase-1 in culture supernatant (Supplementary Figure 3).",

We hypothesized that SARS 3a activates caspase-1 without NLRP3 and ASC. Consistenly, SARS 3a and its mutant produced more cleaved caspase-1 (2.04- and 2.10-fold) and IL-1\u03b2 (1.37- and 1.55-fold) than basal even in the absence of NLRP3 and ASC (Fig. 8c). Based on these results, we checked if SARS 3a interacts directly with caspase-1; our data show that while wild-type SARS 3a interacts with caspase-1, the SARS 3a oligomerization-deficient mutant pulls down caspase-1 to a much greater degree (Fig. 8d). This result suggests that monomeric SARS 3a may have a higher affinity for caspase-1, and that SARS 3a activates the NLRP3 inflammasome both via potassium efflux mediated by SARS 3a oligomers and via direct caspase-1 targeting by SARS 3a monomers.",

On the other hand, there is considerable evidence that an abundance of necroptosis perpetuates pathogenic inflammation and drives tissue injury40. Rip3 deletion rescues the pathogenesis of several animal models of inflammatory disease, including pancreatitis28,41, atherosclerosis42, Gaucher\u2019s disease43, and morbidity after systemic TNF administration44,45, suggesting that necroptosis induces tissue injury by augmenting inflammation after cell death.

Second, while necrotic death of IMMs may suppress the interferon response, necroptosis more generally is an inflammatory process. Inflammatory cell death, especially in the lungs, may contribute to the severe lung damage pathophysiologically associated with clinical development of a cough. As SARS-CoV is transmitted primarily through respiratory droplets, propagation of the general inflammatory response via necroptosis may promote virus transmissibility.

This phenomenon is mechanistically explained by the observation that Rip3 targets SARS 3a to induce its oligomerization, which facilitates SARS 3a membrane insertion and ion channel functionality24. We would briefly like to point out that it is possible the oligomers detected in this study are in fact single or multiple SARS 3a proteins in complex with another unknown protein, though it is clear that this complex is needed for cell death. Taken together, our data show that SARS 3a may act as an alternative death effector protein downstream of the Rip3 to induce necrotic death, in effect hijacking the cells necroptotic machinery to promote virus release and inflammatory cell death. As SARS-CoV infection in monocytes and macrophages is typically abortive46,47, these data provide an alternative mechanism for host cell lysis, virus release, and cell death.",

            "text": "Finally, our data show that SARS 3a directly initiates the inflammatory cascade by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and contributing to pyroptotic death. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by K+ efflux, which causes the kinase NEK7 to translocate to the mitochondrial membrane allowing NLRP3 inflammasome assembly53. SARS 3a oligomers likely activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via K+ efflux, while SARS 3a monomers directly target and activate caspase-1 to cleave IL-1\u03b2. The ability of SARS 3a to generate IL-1\u03b2 is significant, as IL-1\u03b2 is an upstream initiator of the inflammatory cascade. It will be of interest to see whether SARS 3a monomers target and activate other caspases, and to determine the contribution of the proinflammatory pyroptotic cell death to SARS pathogenesis. More detailed experiments looking at the cleavage of the gasdermin D protein will be needed to get a better mechanistic understanding of the contribution of pyroptosis to host cell death, but these are quite relevant as both lung IMMs and lung epithelial cells express inflammasome components54.",

Though previous studies have shown that overexpression of SARS 3a alone can recapitulate these phenotypes, the overexpression nature of this study is a limitation that will require further live virus evaluation of the necroptotic pathway for validation. In summary, our data show that a single SARS accessory protein initiates multiple forms of cell death. More significantly, our data strongly link SARS 3a and the SARS-CoV to Rip3, a necroptotic protein whose inhibition has been shown to ameliorate a variety of inflammatory diseases causing tissue damage. This study supports additional research into the contributions of Rip3 and the necroptotic pathway to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, and may lay the foundation for a new targeted therapy for SARS or MERS patients.",
