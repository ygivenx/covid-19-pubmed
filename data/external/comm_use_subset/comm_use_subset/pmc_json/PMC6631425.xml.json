Establishing relationships among the values of environmental variables, changes in fitness, or the presence of specific mutations is, therefore, a difficult endeavor. In addition, there are many unknowns on the relevance of evolutionary history, chance, and natural selection in shaping the final evolutionary outcome. These complications can be partly dealt with in laboratory evolution experiments carried out with multiple replicas and under conditions imposed by the experimenter, facilitating the disentanglement of correspondences between genetic and phenotypic responses through time [1,2,3,4,5].",

The lower the rate of change, the smaller the drop in fitness the population experiences in each of the environments to which it is exposed. This means that the selective pressure under change has a low intensity at any point of the process and adaptation will occur through the selection of beneficial mutations that provide small effects on fitness [17,18,19,20]. Since these mutations are relatively abundant [21,22,23], there could be a diversity of accessible pathways for adaptation to gradual changes. In contrast to this, rapid environmental changes usually produce strong fitness drops that severely decrease the population size and, thus, the associated genetic diversity [24,25,26,27], making it difficult to find the scarce, large effect mutations that would make adaptation possible, unless those mutants already exist in the population, in which case the population bottleneck might help them to fix. The situation is even harsher when a particular combination of mutations is required for optimal adaptation. Due to the generally lower number of adaptive solutions to rapid changes, evolution would be more constrained under this condition than when changes take place at a slower rate [28]. Additionally, because epistatic interactions among mutations of small effect are weaker [29,30], it has also been suggested that gradual regimes would allow for populations to reach higher fitness values.",

In good agreement with the predictions of the models, in some studies the rate of population extinction was higher under more rapid environmental changes [12,31,32,33] due to the strong decline in population sizes and also, in some cases, because the adapted genotypes were only accessible upon a previous sequence of environments. This kind of historical contingency can occur when certain mutations that permit survival at high intensity of the selective pressure are deleterious in the absence of other mutations that can only be selected at a lower intensity of the selective pressure [12,34]. There are also examples showing that populations evolving under gradual changes reached higher fitness values [9,13,25] and/or displayed more genetic diversity among replicate lineages than those evolving under more abrupt changes [9,12]. In contrast to this, the results obtained in other studies manifested some discrepancy with the prediction of the models, showing that phenotypes obtained under rapid environmental change were fitter [31,32,35] or contained a greater diversity of mutations than those evolving at a slower pace [13]. Finally, other studies did not find differences either in the fitness or in the genetic diversity contained in populations that could be attributed to the rate of environmental change [14,16,36]. Altogether, those results suggest that the differences in evolutionary outcomes due to the rate of change in the selective pressures depend on both the biological system\u2014with its particular mutation and replication rates, relevance of epistatic interactions, and underlying distribution of mutational effects\u2014and on the assayed environmental condition.",

Specifically, we used as a model the bacteriophage Q\u03b2, of the family Leviviridae, which infects Escherichia coli strains expressing the F pilus that acts as the virus receptor [37]. Bacteriophage Q\u03b2 has an RNA genome of positive polarity (such as poliovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, or the coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome) of 4217 nucleotides that encodes four proteins: the A2 protein for bacterial lysis and entry, the coat protein, the A1 protein, which is present in low amounts in the capsid and expressed through incorrect reading of the stop codon of the coat protein, and the replicase that copies the RNA genome [37]. As in other RNA viruses, replication in Q\u03b2 proceeds at a high error rate [38], giving rise to highly heterogeneous populations that adapt fast. The optimal temperature for replication of this virus is 37 \u00b0C (the host temperature).",

Infection of new hosts, adaptation to antivirals, or the emergence of variants that cannot be neutralized by antibodies are only a few examples of the great adaptability of RNA viruses to changes in environmental variables. Therefore, to find effective control therapies, it is necessary to improve our knowledge of their evolutionary possibilities, for which RNA bacteriophages can be an appropriate, and easy to handle, model. In this study, the temperature for Q\u03b2 replication was increased from 37 \u00b0C to 43 \u00b0C either suddenly or following two patterns of gradual change. Due to the importance of the standing genetic diversity prior to adaptation [42], we also compared the evolutionary pathways followed by the virus when populations that differed in their degree of diversification from a clonal origin were propagated at 43 \u00b0C upon a sudden exposure to this temperature.",

In some of them [43,44,45], the used virus variant, which could be directly propagated at 43 \u00b0C, was obtained upon expression of an infectious clone (pBRT7Q\u03b2) containing a cDNA of the virus genome cloned in pBR322 [46,47]. In another work [34] carried out with a different virus variant (obtained upon expression of the infectious clone pACYCQ\u03b2 [48]), the temperature had to be gradually increased (in three steps) from 37 \u00b0C to 43.6 \u00b0C degrees to avoid virus extinction. Alignment of the virus genomes cloned in pACYCQ\u03b2 and pBRT7Q\u03b2 showed the presence of two silent substitutions in the latter (C1257U and C2249U). These substitutions, together with G4A, U192C, and C2201U (also silent), were a necessary requirement for the virus obtained upon expression of pACYCQ\u03b2 to adapt to a high temperature [34]. Since a variant that could replicate at 43 \u00b0C was needed to analyze the adaptive process of Q\u03b2 as a function of the rate of temperature change, the virus populations used in this work were all generated from the infectious clone pBRT7Q\u03b2.",

The sudden pattern (S) entailed an abrupt exposure to 43 \u00b0C, after which the temperature was kept constant. The remaining two patterns involved a progressive temperature change: a gradual increase of 1 \u00b0C every 10 transfers (pattern G) or a two-step increase consisting of 30 transfers at 40 \u00b0C and 30 transfers at 43 \u00b0C (pattern TS). Population Q\u03b2-t25 was propagated through the three patterns of change, giving rise to the evolutionary lineages S-t25, TS-t25, and G-t25. Population Q\u03b2-t2 was only subjected to the sudden treatment, giving rise to the evolutionary lineages S-t2. All propagations were carried out in triplicate for a total of 60 transfers at a higher-than-optimal temperature (see Materials and Methods). Note that the number of transfers experienced at 43 \u00b0C was different for different populations: 60, 30, and 10 transfers in populations evolved through patterns S, TS, and G, respectively.",

Values were referred to that of the corresponding ancestor population (4.7 \u00b1 0.1 for Q\u03b2-t2 and 4.8 \u00b1 0.7 for Q\u03b2-t25). The similarity between fitness values of populations Q\u03b2-t2 and Q\u03b2-t25 indicates that the previous evolution at 37 \u00b0C did not significantly increase fitness at 43 \u00b0C. In contrast to this, results obtained with the lineages evolved at a higher-than-optimal temperature showed that virus propagation at temperatures above 38 \u00b0C always produced fitness increases at 43 \u00b0C (Figure 3). Both the rate of temperature increase and the previous history of the ancestor population influenced fitness dynamics, as observed in the different adaptive trajectories that were followed (Figure 3). Fitness increased much faster in populations suddenly exposed to 43 \u00b0C, particularly in lineages S-t25, in which most of the increase took place during the first 10 transfers. Lineages S-t2 increased their fitness more slowly than lineages S-t25, and almost linearly until transfer number 40. In lineages evolving through the progressive treatments, the largest fitness increases took place between transfers 20 and 40 in lineages TS-t25 (the last 10 transfers at 40 \u00b0C and the first 10 transfers at 43 \u00b0C), and between transfers 10 and 20 (39 \u00b0C) and transfers 40 and 50 (42 \u00b0C) in lineages G-t25.",

Both populations presented a uracil at positions 1257 and 2249, which is a characteristic of pBRT7Q\u03b2 that facilitates adaptation to a high temperature (see Introduction).

The analysis of the mutations selected in each of these environments may shed some light on the fitness effects of mutations at different temperatures. We determined which mutations were detected for the first time in the range between 38 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C or at temperatures above 40 \u00b0C in the lineages TS-t25 and G-t25.

Some of these substitutions were also present in most of the lineages evolving constantly at 43 \u00b0C (G1312A, U1295C/G, G1371A), suggesting that they are beneficial at all assayed temperatures.

Whereas A1930G exhibited a significant propensity to be lost at later transfers, suggesting a negative effect at higher temperatures, C1806U remained in all lineages and C2201U in one (Supplementary Figure S1).

            "text": "Previous studies carried out with Q\u03b2 showed a discrepancy in the capacity of this virus to withstand high temperatures. Whereas the virus obtained upon expression of the infectious clone pACYCQ\u03b2 [48] was unable to produce an infectious progeny at 43.6 \u00b0C [34], the virus obtained upon expression of pBRT7Q\u03b2 [46,47] could replicate at 43 \u00b0C, although rendering much lower titers than at 37 \u00b0C [44]. The ability of pBRT7Q\u03b2 to generate viruses able to replicate at 43 \u00b0C was probably due to the presence of two silent substitutions (C1257U and C2249U) that, together with G4A, U192C, and C2201U (also silent), allowed for adaptation to a high temperature of the virus obtained upon expression of pACYCQ\u03b2 [34]. Optimal adaptation also needed the fixation of substitutions A1088G, A2748C, and U2776C, whose beneficial effects were dependent on the presence of the aforementioned set of five silent substitutions. As we have shown in this work, Q\u03b2 obtained upon expression of pBRT7Q\u03b2 could efficiently adapt to replication at 43 \u00b0C both when the temperature increased sharply and when it did in a more gradual manner. Thus, the presence of only C1257U and C2249U sufficed to permit virus replication at 43 \u00b0C, keeping population sizes compatible with optimal adaptation. Substitutions A1088G, U2776C, and C2201U were also detected in the evolutionary lineages analyzed in this work, all with origin in pBRT7Q\u03b2. Altogether, the results obtained with both Q\u03b2 variants show the relevance of the genetic background to determine the fitness effects of mutations [3,4,50,51,52,53], in this case of those with beneficial effects at a high temperature. Since some of the mutations that facilitate adaptation of Q\u03b2 to increased temperature were already present in the virus prior to high-temperature exposure, it would be expected that they could exert similar effects under other unrelated selective pressures.",

However, neither the fitness gains reached when the evolution experiment was stopped nor the fitness trajectories along the transfer series were similar. The lower the rate of temperature increase, the larger the number of transfers needed to duplicate the fitness of the ancestor, which agrees with the selection of mutations of smaller effect at lower intensities of the selective pressure, as predicted by theoretical models [17,18,19,20]. By transfer number 60, sudden exposure to 43 \u00b0C also led to fitness values higher than those reached under progressive temperature changes, as observed elsewhere [31,32,35]. Differences in the fitness dynamics could be well-explained if, as mentioned above, the mutations selected in lineages subjected to different treatments had different effects on fitness and/or they accumulated at a different rate.",

The fast selection of these mutations in lineages S-t25 suggests that their ancestor population probably contained some genomes that either had beneficial effects at 43 \u00b0C or could facilitate the acquisition of adaptive mutations at this temperature. The first fixed mutations were not the same in the different treatments, which could indicate that the magnitude of their effects, or even the sign of some of them, depended on the intensity of the selective pressure, something that has also been demonstrated in previous studies [12,34]. The lower fitness values reached at transfer 60 by populations evolved through the progressive treatments could also be explained if the mutations acquired during transfers carried out at lower temperatures entailed fitness costs at higher temperatures or imposed restrictions on the mutations acquired at later transfers. In line with this argument, some of the first fixed mutations in lineages S-t25, probably responsible for their large fitness increases at early transfers, were not present in the lineages evolved at a progressively increased temperature. The clearest example of a mutation with a probable fitness cost at a high temperature was A1930G, which was only present in lineages G-t25 and TS-t25 at early transfers\u2014to disappear later as the temperature rose\u2014and was always absent in lineages S-t25.",

There was a negative linear relationship between those values and the fitness gains upon the subsequent 10 transfers at 43 \u00b0C, confirming the general observation in micro-organisms that fitter populations adapt more slowly than less fit populations [54,55,56,57]. This decrease in the rate of adaptation indicates that either better-adapted populations have already used most of the beneficial mutations available or that beneficial mutations have weaker effects on fitter genotypes. The latter is a form of epistasis known as diminishing returns epistasis [58,59], identified in previous studies, that seems to represent a generic negative coupling among beneficial mutations. Diminishing returns epistasis could explain why some of the mutations responsible for the largest fitness increases in poorly adapted populations (population Q\u03b2-t25 before propagation through the sudden treatment) were not selected when better-adapted populations were also exposed to 43 \u00b0C (lineages TS-25 at transfer number 30 and lineages G-t25 at transfer number 50).",

Due to differences in their life histories, both ancestors Q\u03b2-t2 and Q\u03b2-t25 probably contain different genetic diversity, arguably lower in population Q\u03b2-t2 than in Q\u03b2-t25. The rapidity of adaptation in lineages S-t25 suggests the presence in their ancestor populations of some genomes containing mutations that facilitate adaptation to 43 \u00b0C. These genomes should be present in low frequencies, since population Q\u03b2-t25 does not have higher fitness than Q\u03b2-t2 at 43 \u00b0C. In contrast to this, adaptive mutations were probably absent from population Q\u03b2-t2 and had to be generated de novo, which causes the lower rate of adaptation in lineages S-t2. This fact can also underlie the higher nucleotide diversity among replicate lineages and the larger number of transfers that is required for the fixation of the first set of mutations in lineages S-t2 as compared to lineages S-t25.",

The main differences in the consensus sequences of lineages St-25 and S-t2 at transfer number 60 were due to mutations represented in only one evolutionary lineage. Those mutations could not have selective value and may have been fixed through hitchhiking. Most represented mutations identified in this study were also detected in previous studies in which Q\u03b2 adapted to a high temperature [34,43,44,45]. This agreement notwithstanding, most of the mutations (12 out of 16) that were present in only one evolutionary lineage had not been previously detected during adaptation of Q\u03b2 to a high temperature.",

            "text": "There are multiple fitness traits that can be associated with increased performance of Q\u03b2 to high temperatures, among them the extracellular stability of the virus particles, the adsorption rate to the host, the time span that is required to produce an intracellular progeny, and the liberation of the new-formed viruses to the external medium. Kashiwagi et al. [60] prepared several site-directed mutants containing different sets of mutations among those selected at a high temperature, and determined some of the parameters that characterize the Q\u03b2 infective cycle. All the combinations of assayed mutations increased the phage adsorption rate and decreased the latent period at 43.6 \u00b0C, which agrees with adaptation to this temperature. However, surprisingly, the same site-directed mutants displayed decreased thermal stability at 43.8 \u00b0C, which was attributed to the presence of substitution A1088G (D342G) in the A2 protein. Nucleotide D342 is placed near the surface of the capsid and has been suggested to interact with the coat protein. Thus, mutations at this position can alter the stability of the capsid [61]. Further experiments showed that stability could be restored, at least partially, through silent mutations that affect the structure of the RNA. Other substitutions that may have an effect on virus stability are C1649U (synonymous, in the coat protein), A1930G (Q195R in the A1 protein), U2016C (F224L in the A1 protein), and G3945A (G531S in the replicase). All of them were identified in an experiment designed to select an increased virus multiplication rate at 37 \u00b0C, which was associated with decreased stability at the same temperature [62]. Altogether, these results illustrate how the optimization of some fitness traits entails a cost in others, requiring the presence of additional mutations to generate an optimized genotype. Currently, the crystal structure of all the Q\u03b2 proteins has been determined [61,63,64,65,66], opening the door to computational studies able to assess whether a particular mutation (or combination of mutations) influences the stability of the protein. Similar studies could be carried out with the genomic RNA.",

Determination of the consensus sequences of sets of biological clones at different points of the process would be very useful to determine which associations of mutations are favored (such as U2016C, U3311G, and C3903U, which appear always together in the same lineages, suggesting that their positive effect could be dependent on their joint presence), and to determine the intra-population dynamics of adaptation. These studies are currently under progress and will help to better elucidate the relationships between the pattern of change in the environmental variables, the internal structure of populations, and the availability of adaptive pathways.",
