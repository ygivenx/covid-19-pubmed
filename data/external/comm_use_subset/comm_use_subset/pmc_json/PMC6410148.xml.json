The recent ZIKV outbreak in South America has resulted in an unprecedented large number of infection cases [3]. ZIKV has emerged as a public health threat. Currently, there are no countermeasures available for the prevention or treatment of ZIKV infection, except for symptom relief management. Vaccine development is still at its early stages and it is unknown when an approved ZIKV vaccine will be available. ",

In this Tc bovine (TcB) system, bovine immunoglobulin genes were genetically inactivated and the Ig functions were reconstituted by a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin repertoire. It has been demonstrated that not only physiological levels of fully-human polyclonal antibodies can be produced in the blood of TcB but also that TcB can be hyperimmunized with an antigen of choice to produce highly potent antigen-specific human polyclonal antibodies. Some of these antibodies have been successfully used to treat a list of viral and bacterial infections [5].",

In the meantime, as an effort to develop novel animal models of viral infection, we have developed a signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) gene knockout (KO) golden Syrian hamster [7]. Compared to the commonly used A129, Ifnar-/-, or the AG129 mice as models of viral infections, in which either the type I interferon (A129 and Ifnar-/- mice) or both type I and type II interferon receptors are knocked out (AG129 mice), STAT2 KO hamsters are only partially defective in type I interferon signaling, thus they are less immunocompromised than the above-mentioned mouse models. Furthermore, because ZIKV, as well as several other flaviviruses, exerts its infectivity in humans [8,9] through targeting human STAT2 protein to inactivate human type I interferon responses, infection of STAT2 KO hamsters by ZIKV would mimic the innate immune responses in humans upon ZIKV infection. Indeed, we recently have demonstrated that STAT2 KO hamsters are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection. By using this novel STAT2 KO hamster, the first non-murine rodent model of viral infection, we recently demonstrated that infection of pregnant hamsters leads to the vertical transmission of ZIKV to the uterus, placenta, and immune privileged sites, such as the testes and fetal brain [10].",

The generation of anti-ZIKV human polyclonal antibodies SAB-155 from TcB was described previously [6,11]. Briefly, a plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding a full-length ZIKV prME gene described by Hooper et al. [6] was used as a vaccine to immunize TcB. The TcB was hyperimmunized 4 times (V1\u2013V4) at 3-week intervals with the antigen at 12 mg per animal per vaccination by using a PharmaJet Stratis\u00ae IM injection device as previously described [6]. ZIKV-specific antibodies, termed SAB-155, were purified from the plasma collected from hyperimmunized animals. Negative control antibodies used in this study were human polyclonal antibodies purified from the sera of the same TcB before ZIKV immunization.",

A total volume of 200 \u00b5l serum with PBS and ZIKV mixture was added to each well of a twelve-well plate containing Vero 76 cells at 90% confluence. The plate was incubated for 1 h with periodic rocking at 37 \u00b0C. One ml of agarose overlay media was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Three days later, the cells were stained with a crystal violet solution containing formaldehyde and the plaques were counted. The inverse of the dilution that caused a 50% reduction was reported as the 50% plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT50). The titer of the infectious virus was similarly determined, except that no serum was added to the sample. ",

Sera were collected at 2, 3, and 4.5 dpi for detecting neutralizing antibody titers. Based on the PRNT50 data (Figure 1A), sera assayed at these time-points had detectable levels of ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody, indicating that infection can elicit a neutralizing antibody response in STAT2 KO hamsters. Significant serum viremia was also found at 3 dpi (2/3 animals) and 4.5 dpi (3/3) animals (Figure 1B). To investigate ZIKV infection in testis, testicles were harvested at 2, 3, and 4.5 dpi for ZIKV RNA detection and immunohistochemistry analysis. ZIKV RNA levels were significantly higher in two animals on both the right and left testis at 3 and 4.5 dpi than at 2 dpi (Figure 1C). Parts of the testicular tissues from the same animals were also analyzed with IHC. ZIKV-ir, while negative for the testes isolated at 2 dpi, was positive in between the seminiferous tubules at 3 dpi and 4.5 dpi, possibly from infection of interstitial cells of the testis (Figure 1D\u2013F). This clearly correlated with the presence of ZIKV RNA (Figure 1C) in the testes and indicated that ZIKV can establish infections in the testis as early as 3 dpi (but not 2 dpi). ",

As shown in Figure 2A, all of SAB-155-treated animals survived (except for one that died from eye bleeding procedures), whereas 42% (5 out of 12) animals in the control-antibody treated group succumbed. In addition, SAB-155-treated animals did not lose weight while the control-antibody treated animals started to lose weight at 3 dpi and continued to lose weight through 9 dpi (Figure 2B). STAT2 KO hamsters exhibited conjunctivitis after ZIKV infection, which was significantly reduced in animals treated prophylactically with SAB-155: 50% (6 out of 12) of the control-antibody treated animals were free of conjunctivitis, while 81% (9 out of 11) of SAB-155 treated animals were free of eye disease (Figure 2C). Furthermore, 100% of the animals with conjunctivitis became moribund in the control antibody-treated group. Higher titers of ZIKV RNA were detected in the control antibody treated group than in the SAB-155 treated group (Figure 2D; PRNT data Figure 2E) suggesting prophylactic administration of SAB-155 at \u22121 dpi with a single dose of 100 mg/kg can inhibit ZIKV replication leading to effective prophylactic protection.

Equal numbers of age-matched (6-week) male (n = 4) and female (n = 4) STAT2 KO hamsters were infected with ZIKV followed by treatment of SAB-155 via the i.p. route at either \u22121 dpi (treatment control group), 3 dpi, or 4.5 dpi. Sham infected control groups had two male and two female hamsters. As shown in Figure 3A, a single dose SAB-155 administered via i.p. injection at a dose of 100 mg/kg at \u22121, 3, and 4.5 dpi prevented STAT2 KO hamsters from becoming moribund (Figure 3A), whereas the negative control antibody treated group started to become moribund at 8 dpi. Such data indicate that SAB-155 treatment as late as 4.5 dpi is effective in protecting hamsters from morbidity. It is interesting to note that, judged on a significant (p < 0.002) improvement in weight change, the therapeutic treatments at 3 and 4.5 dpi provided similar protection as prophylactic treatment (\u22121 dpi) (Figure 3B). It is unclear why the hamsters in the sham-infected group treated with SAB-155 on 1 dpi did not gain weight but we speculate that this was mostly caused by handling procedures during the experiments that have yet to be identified.",

As shown in Figure 3C, SAB-155 administered at \u22121 and 3 dpi to STAT2 KO hamsters resulted in undetectable ZIKV RNA in their testes (Figure 3C). On the contrary, high levels of ZIKV RNA were detected in the testicular tissues collected on 21 dpi from the surviving male hamsters that were treated on 4.5 dpi (Figure 3C), even though animals treated at 4.5 dpi did not display mortality or body weight loss (Figure 3A,B). This suggests that ZIKV can cross blood-testis barrier and persistently infect seminiferous tubules and that SAB-155 treatment as late as 4.5 dpi is ineffective in viral clearance. The histology also showed that one of the four animals treated at 4.5 dpi had severe pyogranulomatous inflammatory infiltrates (Figure 3H and Table 1). ZIKV-ir indicates possible infection of interstitial cells, as well as cells lining the seminiferous tubules (Figure 3I\u2019). The presence of ZIKV RNA (Figure 3C) in the testes corresponds with the histological lesions (Figure 3D\u2013I) and ZIKV-immunoreactivity (Figure 3D\u2019\u2013I\u2019). None of the STAT2 KO hamsters treated with SAB-155 at \u22121 and 3 dpi exhibited any lesions (Figure 3F,G) nor showed ZIKV-immunoreactivity within the interstitium and seminiferous tubules (Figure 3F\u2019,G\u2019). Such data indicate that SAB-155 treatment as late as 3 dpi provided complete protection against ZIKV infection in the testis. Two out of four animals treated with SAB-155 on 4.5 dpi had pyogranulomatous inflammation in the interstitium and seminiferous tubules (Table 1) along with ZIKV positive cells (red color, Figure 3H\u2019) even though the animal did not lose weight and survived to the end of the experimental period (Figure 3B). This suggests that STAT2 KO hamsters can be used as a non-lethal animal model to study antivirals and vaccine treatment against ZIKV infection. ",

Towards these goals, we tested 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg for the higher doses and 10 mg/kg for the lower dose. Survival (Figure 4A), weight loss (Figure 4B), percentage of free disease signs (Figure 4C), and RT-PCR on ZIKV RNA (Figure 4D) were evaluated for all treatment groups. We also performed H&E and IHC analyses on testicular tissues at 21 dpi for the higher dose groups (Table 1). A dose of 10 mg/kg SAB-155 treatment administered on 4.5 dpi prevented 88% (7 out of 8) animals from morbidity (Figure 4A). However, significant weight loss was observed in this low dose group of animals starting at 9 dpi (Figure 4B) and about 80% of animals showed disease signs (Figure 4C). In comparison, treatments with the higher doses of SAB-155 (200 mg/mL and 400 mg/kg) provided nearly 100% protection from morbidity (Figure 4A), while only marginally alleviating weight loss and disease signs (Figure 4B and 4C). As shown in Figure 4D, high levels of ZIKV RNA were still detected at 21 dpi in the testicular tissues of the hamsters treated at higher doses at 4.5 dpi, even though no mortality was observed. The detection of ZIKV RNA is consistent with the detection of pathological lesions and positive ZIKV-ir in this organ as summarized in Table 1. This indicates that at 4.5 dpi, neither of the two tested higher doses can provide complete protection against ZIKV infection in the testis. ",

We recently reported that adult STAT2 KO hamsters are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and that ZIKV RNA titers were detected in the testis, kidney, brain and spinal cord of infected STAT2 KO hamsters [10]. Compared to stat2 KO mice which develop uniform lethal phenotype upon ZIKV infection, only about 50% of STAT2 KO hamsters infected by ZIKV succumbed (Figure 2A), with the onset of death being delayed a few days in the hamster than in the mouse [18]. A side by side comparison between the stat2 KO mouse model and the STAT2 KO hamster model challenged with same strains of ZIKV would be interesting to investigate the difference between species in the development of the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection. Since STAT2 KO hamsters often survive for the duration of the experimental period, i.e., 21 dpi, with viral RNA present in the testis, brain, and other organs, this unique hamster model provides an opportunity to test the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments with anti-ZIKV antibodies.

A number of antivirals have been shown to be active against ZIKV infection in immunodeficient AG129 [12,20], A129 (Ifnar-/-) [21], and immunocompetent C57BL/6 mouse models [22]. Apart from the antivirals, antibodies with inactivated Fc receptors have also been shown to be protective in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent pregnant rodent models. Convalescent sera from ZIKV-infected patients [23], monoclonal antibody from DENV patients [24], and ZIKV-117 mAb from human antisera [25] were tested against different strains of ZIKV virus in several mouse models. Hundreds of monoclonal antibodies targeting the E protein of ZIKV with neutralization activity of <1\u00b5g/mL, either derived from human patients or mice, have also been identified [26]. In primate models, the administration of a cocktail of potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies collected from ZIKV-infected patients completely prevented serum viremia [27]. In the present study, we used a unique hamster model to investigate the prophylactic and therapeutic effects of SAB-155 against ZIKV infection. We were particularly focused on the potential of SAB-155 in eliminating ZIKV in the testis, and to gather some preliminary scientific information on the potential of using SAB-155 to treat sexual transmission.

We then tested whether a single dose of SAB-155 administered prophylactically at \u22121 dpi would be able to protect the hamsters from morbidity, weight loss, and conjunctivitis. Our results showed that prophylactic treatment at \u22121 dpi at a dose of 100mg/kg of SAB-155 was effective in preventing hamster mortality (Figure 2A) and weight loss (Figure 2B), as well as a reduction in disease signs (conjunctivitis; Figure 2C).

According to the FDA animal efficacy rule, the development of therapeutic interventions against serious conditions, such as those caused by ZIKV, should be demonstrated to be efficacious in more than one animal species. Second, we demonstrated that SAB-155 is highly effective, both prophylactically and therapeutically, in treating ZIKV infection in this hamster model. In contrast to other animal-derived monoclonal antibodies, SAB-155 is fully-human (non-immunogenic to patients), polyclonal (recognizing multiple antigens on a virus to effectively reduce or eliminate viral evasion caused by viral mutations) and can be produced very quickly and in large quantities (up to 600 g fully human immunoglobulin can be produced per Tc bovine per month; our unpublished observations). These advantages over other antiviral therapies could potentially make SAB-155, as well as the TcB platform, a powerful countermeasure in fighting ZIKV infection. It is worth noting that TcB derived fully human polyclonal antibodies elicited against several other viruses or bacteria have been shown to be effective to treat infections caused by various infectious pathogens [5,6,11,28,29,30,31]. Some of these TcB antibodies have already been proven to be safe and efficacious in human clinical trials [31,32]. The anti-ZIKV TcB antibodies reported in this study are yet to be tested in rigorous human clinical trials to be proven effective in treating ZIKV in human infections.",
