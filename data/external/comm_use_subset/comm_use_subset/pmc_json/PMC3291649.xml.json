During or soon after virus release from cells, Pr55gag is cleaved by viral protease (PR) into four major products: matrix (MA, p17), capsid (CA, p24), nucleocapsid (NC, p7), and p6 domains [1]. PR is encoded by pol, which is initially translated as a Pr160gag-pol polyprotein by a ribosomal frameshift event that occurs at a frequency of 5%, resulting in the expression of Pr160gag-pol to Pr55gag at a ratio of approximately 1\u223620 [2]. Pr160gag-pol is incorporated into virions via interactions with assembling Pr55gag\n[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Pr160gag-pol cleavage by PR yields reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) in addition to Gag products. The PR-mediated proteolytic cleavage of Pr55gag and Pr160gag-pol, known as virus maturation, is essential for the acquisition of viral infectivity [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].",

            "text": "How PR is activated to mediate virus maturation is not completely clear. One proposal is that interaction among Pr160gag-pol molecules triggers the activation of embedded PR, which in homodimeric form mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage following PR autocleavage from Pr160gag-pol. Maintenance of the Pr55gag/Pr160gag-pol expression ratio is critical to virus assembly; the artificial overexpression of Pr160gag-pol or PR drastically reduces virion production as a result of enhanced Gag processing by overexpressed PR activity [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Equally important is the Pr160gag-pol sequence and structure, since sequence mutations upstream or downstream of PR often result in defective virus maturation or Gag cleavage [4], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Impaired Gag cleavage is assumed as being due, at least in part, to impaired PR activation, which is likely secondary to inadequate PR dimer interaction. Since natural RT is heterodimeric [25], [26], there is speculation that RT in the Gag-Pol context facilitates Pr160gag-pol-Pr160gag-pol interaction via RT-RT interaction, which in turn influences PR activation. Consistent with this scenario, RT deletion mutations can lead to severely impaired PR-mediated Gag processing [23]. In addition, efavirenz (EFV), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that enhances RT dimerization in vitro [27], [28], reduces virus production as a result of greatly enhanced Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage [29], [30]. Furthermore, a single amino acid substitution in RT (W402A) leads to significantly reduced virus production due to markedly enhanced PR-mediated Gag cleavage [31]. Combined, these data suggest that the RT domain plays an important role in PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction.",

Accordingly, structural conformations rather than specific sequences may be major determinants of the PR activation process. A protein sequence unrelated to HIV-1 but possessing dimerization capacity may therefore promote PR activation by facilitating PR dimer interaction when fused to the end of PR. To test this possibility, we removed the RT and IN sequences and placed a leucine zipper (LZ)-coding sequence at the C-terminus of PR. Results indicate that LZ placement significantly reduced virion release due to enhanced Gag cleavage, similar to observations for RT W402A mutations. These results support the hypothesis that the placement of heterologous protein dimerization sequences downstream of PR can significantly enhance Gag processing efficiency by promoting PR activation.",

The resulting constructs were designated PRWz and PRWWz (Fig. 1). We used PRKz and PRKKz constructs containing the dimerization-defective LZ mutant version (Kz) as controls. Kz fusion to PRWz at the wt LZ C- and N-termini yielded constructs PRWKz and PRKWz, respectively. Each mutant was transiently expressed in 293T cells. Virus particle assembly and processing were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. The results shown in Figure 2A indicate that Gag/PR transfectants produced substantial quantities of VLPs at levels that were near wild-type. Unprocessed Gag (the Gag precursor Pr55) and incompletely processed Gag (the intermediate p41gag) represent two major Gag products compared to wt in our supernatant and cell samples (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 vs. 2). This is consistent with a report stating that a deletion in a downstream pol sequence significantly impairs PR-mediated virus maturation [23].",

To test this possibility, and to confirm the effect of LZ domain placement on Gag processing efficiency, we collected samples at 24 and 48 h following the transient expression of wt and mutants. We observed that both PRWz and PRWWz showed significantly higher cellular p24gag/Pr55gag ratios compared to those of wt or Gag/PR (Fig. 2B). Although PRWKz and PRKWz showed cellular Gag processing profiles similar to those of PRKz and PRKKz at 48 h, they displayed higher p24gag/Pr55gag ratios compared to Gag/PR at 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 2B upper panel, lanes 15\u201316 vs. lane 10).

Believing that the potent Gag assembly domain might determine chimera multimerization status, we predicted that the contribution of LZ to enhanced chimera multimerization would be barely (if at all) detectable. We therefore assessed chimera multimerization capacity in a Gag assembly-defective context. After constructing an assembly-defective mutant (designated MoGag) and confirming that the mutation significantly impaired Gag assembly (Fig. 4B), we cloned PR-LZ chimeras into MoGag. To block the effect of PR activity on Gag-PR-LZ chimera assembly assays, all chimeras were introduced into a PR-inactivated HIV-1 Pr160gag-pol-expression plasmid GPfs [4], with gag and pol in the same reading frame (Fig. 4A). Results from repeated independent experiments indicate that chimeras with predicted molecular weights were detected in both supernatants and cell lysates following transient expression in 293T cells, suggesting that all chimeras were capable of assembly and release to some extent. However, we noted that MoGagfsWz transfectants produced more chimeric VLPs than MoGagfsD or MoGagfsKz (Figs. 4C and 4D). To confirm that MoGag was multimerization-defective and that LZ did enhance assembly-defective Gag multimerization, we subjected wt Gag and each mutant to velocity sedimentation analyses. A non-myristylated (myr-) Gag mutant [32] known to be severely defective in both membrane binding and multimerization served as a negative control. Our data indicate that most of the wt Gag was recovered at fractions 3 to 5; in contrast, most myr- Gag and substantial amounts of MoGag were recovered at fractions 1 and 2. Portions of MoGagfsD and MoGagfsKz were detected at lower sucrose density fractions, whereas MoGagfsWz was almost completely recovered at higher sucrose density fractions (Fig. 4E). Unlike MoGagfsWz, which mostly sedimented at fractions 4 and 5, considerable amounts of MoGagfsWKz and MoGagfsKWz were also recovered at fraction 3, and low but detectable amounts were observed in fraction 2. This sedimentation pattern was similar to that of MoGagfsKz (Fig. 4E, three bottom panels). Also similar to MoGagfsKz, both MoGagfsWKz and MoGagfsKWz were incapable of efficiently assembling into chimeric VLPs (data not shown). We observed this result in repeated independent experiments. This finding suggests that when fused to the PR C-terminus, a LZ tandem repeat containing a wt and mutant LZ (WKz or KWz) does not enhance Gag-PR multimerization as effectively as a wt LZ tandem repeat (Wz). This may partly explain why PRWKz and PRKWz showed relatively lower Gag cleavage efficiency compared to PRWWz (Fig. 2).",

MoGag with an LZ fusion was expressed in a Gag/PR context, thus expressing both Pr55gag and PR containing Gag-Pol or Gag-PR(-LZ) fusions (Fig. 5A). As expected, the insertion of LZ into MoGag/PR at the PR C-terminus resulted in significantly enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency (Fig. 5C, lanes 11 vs. 15), suggesting that the LZ enhancement of Gag-PR multimerization is correlated with increased PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency. Inefficient Gag cleavage, likely due to either impaired PR activation as a result of Pol truncation or to inhibited PR activity due to a protease inhibitor, resulted in improved MoGag VLP assembly (Fig. 5C, lanes 9\u201312 and 15\u201318). This suggests that the MoGag assembly defect is PR activity-dependent, at least in part. The MoPRWWz had significantly higher cellular p24gag/Pr55gag ratios compared to MoGag/PR, but slightly lower compared to PRWWz (Figs. 5B and 5C), suggesting that the multimerization-defective Gag mutation reduced the LZ-mediated enhancement of Gag cleavage.

Our results indicate an efficient Gag processing profile for myr- PRWWz, similar to that of its myristylation-positive counterpart, PRWWz (Fig. 6).

One possibility is that the transframe peptide p6pol may play a role in modulating PR dimer interface interaction, thus preventing premature PR activation. Due to a blocking mutation at the p6pol/PR cleavage, p6pol-retaining PR is defective in mediating virus maturation [42], [43], [44], [45], suggesting that a fully functional PR requires the removal of p6pol. However, to our knowledge there are no reports on the role of p6pol in PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. We found that a Gag-Pol mutant with deleted p6pol was incapable of efficiently processing coexpressed Pr55gag, which argues against the possibility of p6pol playing a role in suppressing PR activation [46]. According to one recent study, the insertion of a larger reporter sequence in the p6pol region markedly impairs virus maturation, whereas partial substitution with a heterologous sequence does not [47]. This suggests that structural conformation, rather than a specific sequence upstream of PR, is important for determining PR activation.",

In contrast, we found that LZ is capable of triggering Gag cleavage enhancement when placed at the PR C-terminus. The RT domain apparently plays a role in preventing premature PR activation. Previous studies suggest that the downstream structural conformation of PR is important in terms of modulating PR activation. First, a single RT amino acid substitution (W402A) that is not known to have major impacts on in vitro RT dimerization [50] markedly enhances Gag processing [31]. An additional partial deletion at the C-terminus of p66RT not only reverses W402A-triggered Gag cleavage enhancement, but also markedly impairs virus maturation. In contrast, truncated Gag-Pol mutants that retain intact p66 or p51 RT domains still respond to the enhancement effect of W402A on Gag processing [31]. Second, substitution mutations in RT are capable of neutralizing the enhancement effect of EFV on Gag processing [49]. Combined, these data suggest that conformational changes in Gag-Pol may significantly affect PR dimer interface interactions, leading to either premature or insufficient PR activation. Our finding that the fusion of HIV-1-unrelated dimerization protein sequences at the C-terminus of PR sharply enhanced Gag cleavage strongly supports the hypothesis that structural conformation, rather than specific sequences, largely determines PR activation status. The RT structure domain in the Gag-Pol context may help prevent PR from premature activation via a conformation that prevents the PR dimer interface from interacting efficiently. This conformation may change during Gag-Pol packaging, thus supporting more efficient PR dimer interaction.",

Plasmids containing the wt and mutant LZ (provided by E. Barklis [55]) were used to construct the \u0394NC(wtZip) and \u0394NC(Kzip). The human CREB LZ sequence is 284-RECRRKKKEYVKCLENRVAVLENQNKTLIEELKALKDLYCHKSD-327. The underlined amino acid residues E298, R300, E305, Q307, I312, E314, and L321 were mutated to Lys, and N308 was mutated to His, yielding the mutant LZ [54]. Amplified fragments were digested with BamHI and NotI and ligated into the pBRCla-Sal cassette, yielding constructs PRWz and PRKz, respectively. To add the LZ copy, PCR-amplified wt and mutant LZ fragments were purified, digested with a restriction enzyme, and ligated into the PRWz and PRKz, yielding the constructs PRWWz, PRWKz, PRKKz, and PRKWz.",
