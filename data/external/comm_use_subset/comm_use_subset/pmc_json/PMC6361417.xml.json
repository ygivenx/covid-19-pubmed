Recognizing the importance of individuals\u2019 actions in preventing the spread of infection, researchers are beginning to explore mathematical models that incorporate such actions [1, 2]. These models have been used to inform strategies to control the spread of disease [3] and to quantify the role of individual protective actions in controlling several outbreaks, including the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa [4], the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong [5] and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Central Mexico [6].",

            "text": "A number of models have linked media communication about a disease to protective action [7\u201311]. These models postulate that media influence increases with the number of infected people [7\u20139], or with both the number of infected people and the rate of change [10, 11]. Models typically assume that media influence reduces the effective transmission rate, slowing the spread of disease. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework used to evaluate the effect of media on disease transmission can be described by the following set of equations:\nS\u02d9=-f(I,dIdt,p1,\u2026,pk)\u03b2SI(1)\nI\u02d9=f(I,dIdt,p1,\u2026,pk)\u03b2SI-\u03b3I(2)\nR\u02d9=\u03b3I(3)\nN=S+I+R(4)\nIn effect, the population (of size N) is divided into three groups: those susceptible to infection (S), those currently infected (I), and those who have recovered from infection (R). The effect of media, f, is an increasing function of the number of infected individuals and/or the rate of change in the number of infected, controlled by a set of parameters, p1\u2026pk. The media function slows the rate of transmission of the disease when the number of cases is high or when the prevalence of disease is increasing rapidly, creating interesting disease spread dynamics, such as multi-wave outbreaks [8, 9]. It is not clear, however, that the media function formalization suggested by the models adequately reflects actual media influence [12]. The choice of media function critically influences the shape of the disease spread [12], making accurate parameterization of media crucial. Models are just beginning to consider ways to incorporate data on actual media coverage [13].",

We assume that media attention to the outbreak increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing, face mask usage, and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease spread. We model media signal as a function of the actual number of articles published about the disease. Therefore, the media signal in our model is independent of the size of the outbreak. The proposed model is an extension of our previous model, ALARM [14], which attempted to quantify the level of social reaction to disease, but which did not take the role of media into account in the disease transmission process. The key observation that drove the formulation of the ALARM model was that public reaction to a disease is frequently disproportionate to the number of cases. Some outbreaks with very few cases trigger outsized public alarm\u2014for example, the handful of cases of Ebola in the US\u2014while larger and more deadly outbreaks\u2014such as the annual outbreaks of seasonal influenza\u2014generate little interest. Factors such as the novelty of the disease in the area and its clinical severity play a role in shaping the public reaction. By incorporating actual media data into models of disease transmission, we can begin to account for those factors in the transmission dynamics and evaluate their significance in the disease transmission process.",

We show that the observed media coverage of the outbreak differs substantially from what would be predicted by approximate media functions.

Each individual, i\u2019s, disease state at time t is represented by Xti\u2208{S,I,R}, where S = susceptible, I = infected, and R = recovered. Infection is transmitted through pair-wise contact with infected neighbors on the disease network. At time t, an infected individual infects each of her susceptible neighbors, independently, with probability pt. Thus, if Xti=I, Xtj=S, and i and j are neighbors on the disease network, then:\nXt+1j={IwithprobabilityptSwithprobability1-pt.(5)\nFollowing infection, individuals recover after TR time periods. Therefore, if Xt-1i=S and Xti=I, then:\nXti=\u22ef=Xt+TR-1i=IandXt+TRi=R.(6)\nWhen vaccine is available, we implement an imperfect vaccine, with a delay of d time units before becoming effective. For influenza, the delay before full immunity is approximately two weeks [18]. Vaccines are distributed randomly among the susceptible population, according to the estimated number of vaccines administered during the week. Let \u03b7 be the vaccine efficacy. Then, if susceptible individual, i, is vaccinated at time t:\nXt+dj={Rwithprobability\u03b7Swithprobability1-\u03b7.(7)\nIt has been shown that formulating imperfect vaccination as an all-or-nothing effect with probability of vaccination success equal to the vaccine efficacy correctly estimates the direct effectiveness of the vaccine [19].",

Two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03bb, determine how the media signal affects the rate of transmission. Specifically, \u03bb determines the relative importance of recent and prior news coverage in determining individual behavior. As \u03bb increases, the relative weight of recent news articles increases, compared with prior news articles. The parameter \u03b1 controls the degree to which media affects behavior. As \u03b1 increases, media exerts greater influence on behavior, leading to greater reduction in the per contact transmission probability. The effects of \u03bb and \u03b1 on the number of cases and the media function g are shown in Fig 1 for an outbreak in a population of size 500,000 with five weeks of constant media coverage beginning five weeks after the beginning of the outbreak. As \u03bb increases, the effect of media becomes more prominent but for a shorter duration. As \u03bb increases, peak height of media function increases (for \u03b1 greater than 0), indicating that the effect of media gets stronger (lower transmission probability). On the other hand, the rate at which the media function value goes back to one (no media effect) from the peak (maximum media effect) also increases as \u03bb increases, suggesting a shorter duration of media effect. This phenomenon is explained by exponentially-weighted moving average function describing \u03bb: smaller \u03bb considers the media coverage from further back in the past, creating the lingering media effect as observed in the long tail of the media function curve for \u03bb = 1. High values of \u03bb can produce two wave outbreaks, if the value of \u03b1 is high enough to dramatically slow transmission but not high enough to altogether stop transmission for long enough for the outbreak to die out. As \u03b1 increases, media causes greater reductions in the rate of transmission.",

During the spring outbreak where significant media coverage was observed, the model overestimates the peak by over twice as much. In order to replicate the dynamics of the two outbreaks of disease without considering additional control measures, consideration of factors affecting behavior other than the number of infected cases or rate of change in the number of infected cases is necessary.

Although there were no significant differences in the per-contact transmission rate of the H1N1 virus or population structure, the spring outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico City was quickly contained, while the fall outbreak grew to epidemic proportions. Differences in social distancing help to explain the different dynamics of the two outbreaks. The spring outbreak received extensive attention in the Mexican press. By incorporating data on the volume of media coverage of the outbreak and by assuming that media influence leads to increased protective practices and therefore reduction in the per-contact transmission probability, we were able to account for the social distancing that took place during the spring outbreak but which did not occur during the fall outbreak, achieving a good overall fit to the epidemic curves for the spring and fall outbreaks using the same model for both outbreaks. The Mexico City H1N1 example shows that there is not always a the direct link between case counts and media attention. Therefore, it is important to quantify actual media attention in infectious disease models.",

Using data from the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC, we explored the role of media in a typical, seasonal outbreak and demonstrated that the low level media interest exhibited during the influenza season was associated with only a small reduction in the number of cases. Media may be a tool for public health officials to communicate preventive measures to the public during disease outbreaks. Therefore, the effect of significantly increasing the volume of media coverage was explored. It was found that a ten-fold increase in the volume of media coverage resulted in a 33.5% decrease in the median number of infections. Thus, media may be a moderately effective means to prevent disease transmission.",

Thus, as our study illustrates, incorporating media coverage allows for more accurate modeling of infectious disease outbreaks during which there are substantial changes in population behavior.",
