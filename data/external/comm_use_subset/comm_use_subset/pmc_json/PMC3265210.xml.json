One assumption is that a mutant FCoV strain is able to infect monocytes and macrophages, leading to FIP [7\u20139]. This mutant virus strain has been named feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), whereas the strain that causes enteric infection was named feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [7, 10\u201312]. Because FIPV and FECV cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity, or even by genome sequence analysis, they are considered to be two, distinctly different pathotypes, which differ only in their pathogenicity [11, 12]. In fact, although this hypothesis is known as the internal mutation theory, no specific mutation has been identified in the 29 kb FCoV genome [13].",

FECV was shown to contain a 238-nucleotide deletion in ORF7b [20], in contrast to what might be expected if FIPV were indeed a mutant of FECV. According to Vennema et al. [20], it is possible that both FECV and avirulent FIPV strains are derived from FIP inducing strains but have been attenuated by the loss of virulence factors. The authors further propose that recombination of two attenuated viruses during a rare mixed infection event could result in the resurgence of a virulent FIPV strain. ",

These results are in agreement with previous studies that showed that four strains of FCoV (79-1683, TN406-HP, UCD2, and ts-DF2) with deletions in ORF7b were avirulent [22, 28].

Subsequent studies have shown that both deletions and nonsense mutations within ORF3c and, less often, specific mutations in OFR7b are present in FIPVs but not in FECVs [9]. Sequencing of attenuated derivatives of virulent FIPV strains shows good correlation between deletions in ORF7b and attenuation of virulence [21]. This latter observation indicates that the 7b protein encoded by ORF7b is important for virulence. Thus, the virulence-associated ORF7b may be somewhat suppressed in FECVs not adapted to tissue culture, and the presence of an intact ORF3c in these FECVs may be involved in this suppression. Moreover, two cats from the same household were found to contain distinct ORF3c deletions, demonstrating that these two FIPVs were independently derived from FECV and not transmitted horizontally [9].",

These viral subpopulations were analyzed by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) products of genes N and 7b [17, 36]. These studies demonstrate that the composition of FCoV quasispecies in a single cat can differ in different organs [17, 36], and that the heterogeneity of the FCoV genome is related to the severity and clinical form of FIP and the lesions observed in the organs of affected animals [17]. New viral strains present in these subpopulations can alter cell tropism and pathogenicity and may have a significant impact on generating host disease [13]. However, it still remains unclear if the association between genetic diversity and pathogenesis can be attributed to quasispecies dynamics [33]. Moreover, the mere observation of high levels of genetic variation in RNA viruses is not proof of the existence of quasispecies. To demonstrate that RNA viruses form quasispecies, it is necessary to prove that natural selection acts on the viral population as a unit [37].",

In ADE, antibodies might help the spread of the virus in an infected cat by facilitating the virus uptake through the formation of virus-antibody complexes that are taken up by uninfected monocytes/macrophages via the Fc receptor [49].

In addition, these cats have decreased IL-6 levels [32]. In contrast, Takano et al. [56] showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from FIP cats displayed higher IL-6 expression compared to the same cells from SPF cats and suggest that IL-6 is involved in the development of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis and, therefore, in FIP pathogenesis. This probably occurs due to the action of IL-6 to recruit and activate T cells and macrophages, to expand cytotoxic T lymphocytes, to modulate the differentiation of plasma cells and promote increase of vascular permeability [57]. In the central nervous system IL-6 contributes to immune-mediated destruction observed in this tissue from cats with neurological clinical sings of FIP [57].",

However, another study reported that high viral load is not related to the development of FIP [16]. Furthermore, IL-10 negatively regulates the expression of \u03b22-integrins on monocytes, reducing their ability to adhere to endothelial cells and causing vasculitis [6].

This decrease in IL-12 p40 coupled with the presence of large numbers of activated macrophages in the lymphatic tissue and granulomatous infiltrates are signs of immune response failure [32]. IL-12 and Interferon- (IFN-) gamma coordinate the link between pathogen recognition by innate immune cells and the induction of specific immunity, by mediating a positive feedback to amplify the Th1 response (cell-mediated). IFN-gamma is an important cytokine for the Th1 immune response by inducing effector mechanisms such as innate cell-mediated immunity, specific cytotoxic immunity, and macrophage activation [61]. ",

            "text": "In cats with FIP there has been observed increase of AGP concentration [67\u201369] and this AGP is hyposialylated (decrease in the degree of sialylation, a posttranslational modification) [68]. The decrease in the degree of sialylation is important for development of FIP. In catteries with endemic FCoV all cats respond to increased viral burden by increasing the production of AGP but only cats with hyposialylated AGP have persistently increased AGP levels and develop FIP [67]. Paltrinieri et al. [70] investigated the sialylation pattern of serum AGP in nonsymptomatic cats infected by FCoV and its relationship with the amount of FCoVs shed in faeces and observed that hypersialylation of AGP may be one of the factors that could explain why FCoV-infected cats do not develop FIP in spite of the presence of large amount of viral RNA shed in the environment. Possibly, the hypersialylation provides protection from the development of FIP [70].",

[18] formulated a new hypothesis explaining FIP pathogenesis, which suggests the existence of two different strains, virulent and avirulent, circulating among feline populations. These authors performed phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences from ORFs M, S, 3c, and 7b, isolated from FCoV carrier cats, with and without clinical signs of FIP. From this analysis, the authors inferred that FIPV and FECV form monophyletic groups, with high bootstrap values that clearly differentiate them genetically, supporting the presence of two circulating strains. However, more studies are needed using sequences from different geographic regions. In addition, further investigation is required into the correlation of these strains with host related factors, such as immune response, to confirm this hypothesis.",

As demonstrated in this review, the causes underlying FIP pathogenesis are probably multifactorial, with both viral and host factors as well as viral genetic determinants playing important roles in FIP pathogenesis. The studies necessary to show this interaction will likely be complex. Because FCoV is an RNA virus, it is able to easily mutate, and thus there are many FCoV viral subpopulations with variations in different regions of its genome. In addition, individual cats may respond differently to FCoV infection, suggesting that the immune response to FIP is complex. Thus, by definition, both of the FIP pathogenesis theories presented in this review are too simplistic, and further studies are essential to elucidate FIP pathogenesis, and to obtain information that will assist in the development of more accurate diagnostic methods and effective vaccines.",
