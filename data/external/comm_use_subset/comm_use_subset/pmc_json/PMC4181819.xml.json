The limited number of case subjects who underwent laboratory tests for RVI might be associated with selection bias. The multiplex RT-PCR test for respiratory viruses has been introduced into clinical practice recently. Therefore, many clinicians have still a low level of test awareness and only the patients who had preceding or concurrent flu-like or cold symptoms were chosen for RVI testing. Secondly, the number of patients with RVIs other than influenza limited the ability to determine how different viral pathogens affect the clinical severity of pneumococcal pneumonia. Thirdly, this retrospective observational study included patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who received antibiotic therapy for \u22655 days based on the clinical diagnosis and outcome. Therefore, this study may not be representative of untreated patients of pneumococcal pneumonia. However, there were no patients who died within 5 days after admission among the 51 patients who had S. pneumoniae isolation from sputum cultures and received antibiotics therapy for <5 days. Fourthly, the incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia was low in our study; this might be partly due to the exposure of antibiotics before obtaining the first blood culture in 14 (7\u00b73%) patients or the study design, which included only patients with pneumococcal pneumonia who had virological tests for RVI prior to isolating pneumococci from sputum cultures.",
