            "text": "State and local surveillance programs are the foundation of our national biosurveillance enterprise. The federal government's capacity to detect and maintain situational awareness during catastrophic events depends on the ability of state and local agencies (particularly health departments) to build and maintain robust and flexible biosurveillance systems. However, national biosurveillance capabilities are threatened by shortfalls in state and local financial resources. Limits in state budgets make it difficult for agencies to maintain information systems and staff solely with local resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreements have been essential sources of support for state and local health departments to enable them to develop and maintain basic biosurveillance capabilities. While federal preparedness investments have been an important first step, the level of federal funding for biosurveillance appropriated to date is not commensurate with the strategic national importance of these systems. Failure to increase support for health departments will erode critical progress made to date toward ensuring that basic biosurveillance capabilities exist across the United States.",

            "text": "Above all, the US government must ensure that there are adequate numbers of competent personnel to run biosurveillance programs, particularly at state and local health departments. Unfortunately, continued cuts in federal preparedness funding over the past 10 years have forced state and local health departments to scale back on important preparedness programs. These cuts, combined with state budget deficits and layoffs, have exacerbated existing shortages of highly skilled and competent public health personnel to build and maintain biosurveillance systems. Ensuring the functioning of critical biosurveillance programs will require sustained and committed federal support for biosurveillance programs, including adequate and flexible funding to hire and retain biosurveillance analysts.",

Public health departments need detailed data about patients who are affected in order to understand key aspects of the outbreak. While there has been a concerted effort and significant funding allotted to developing electronic health records and to encouraging their adoption by medical providers, far less attention and funding support have been allocated to making sure the information contained in electronic health records is available to public health departments. While some public health departments may receive some electronic data from electronic health records, such as immunization records and laboratory reports, few have the ability to access electronic health records in real time and in a flexible, query-based way that is likely to provide the answers necessary to quickly get on top of a public health emergency as it unfolds.",

Experience in previous emergencies has shown that while most public health surveillance systems focus on data related to the number of infected patients, they often lack data pertaining to availability of hospital beds, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies that are necessary to make informed decisions about how best to respond to a public health emergency. The US government could bring these and other information needs to the private sector and identify potential ways to collect that data and create data-sharing provisions (eg, confidentiality agreements, de-identification steps, etc) needed to share this information with response agencies.",

Though the outbreak caught many political leaders and public health experts by surprise, existing wildlife data indicated that a human outbreak in the region was possible.4 Despite known important linkages between animal and environmental health in determining the occurrence of events, like the Ebola epidemic, that threaten human health, there continue to be insufficient efforts to integrate knowledge and data from across these sectors.",

An important first step will be to increase support for existing surveillance programs that have already demonstrated success, such as ArboNET, which provides important data on the occurrence of Zika, West Nile, and other viruses. Additionally, the US government should give serious consideration to the recommendation, which was made by the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, to create a Nationally Notifiable Animal Disease System.5 Finally, the US government should improve the integration of the food-related surveillance initiatives that exist across the federal government. There are many different, separate national surveillance systems that, if integrated, could provide a better understanding of the occurrence and possible causes of foodborne illness outbreaks. Federal agencies should digitally connect and automate the comparisons of data from the food, animal, and human health surveillance programs that are operated by CDC, FDA, and USDA, which may provide an earlier indication of a link between human and animal infections. At the very least, there should be a way to directly compare isolated patterns that are in animal and human health surveillance programs. CDC's PulseNet and USDA's VetNet programs should be linked and equipped to automate analysis of these 2 data streams for evidence of similarities that may indicate a common exposure.",

It has been reported that because of laboratory backlogs, pregnant women in Florida have experienced delays in getting the results from tests to determine if they have been infected by Zika. Diagnostic delays such as these not only compromise care for women and their unborn children, but hinder our abilities to conduct epidemiologic investigations to determine whether and how the outbreak may be spreading. Increased support for public health and clinical laboratories is needed to ensure there is adequate surge capacity during crises.",

Currently, it is not easy to determine if someone has been infected with Zika unless they are within a small window of time after the onset of symptoms. The inability to determine with confidence whether someone was infected with Zika in the past makes it difficult to counsel patients and interrupt transmission. The US government should expand current support for efforts to develop new diagnostic technologies for Zika and other important public health threats.",

While the world is undergoing a big data revolution, in the United States a current bottleneck in biosurveillance analysis is lack of good tools and a skilled workforce to support better analysis and visualization of biosurveillance information, particularly data that exist outside of traditional public health surveillance streams. The United States should take advantage of the wisdom and talent of the crowds to improve the analysis and visualization of biosurveillance information by making anonymized surveillance data publicly available. Publishing de-identified surveillance data in as close to real time as possible would enable interested citizens to develop applications to enable enhanced analysis of biosurveillance information.",

As the pace of globalization and international travel increases, new diseases will continue to emerge and spread. Our best defense against these events is to have in place systems that will quickly detect their occurrence and to improve understanding of what is needed to stop them. Without effective biosurveillance systems, political leaders will have little information to guide decisions about what measures should be taken to ensure that small outbreaks don't go on to become costly epidemics and what measures would be likely to exacerbate the toll of the event. Though important strides have been made toward development of these systems in the United States, critical gaps remain, and eroding financial support for biosurveillance threatens to undermine progress made to date. To ensure it has the best information available to successfully manage the infectious disease events that will inevitably occur during the next administration, the US government should expand its support for the biosurveillance mission.",
