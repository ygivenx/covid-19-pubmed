Approximately 20%\u201330% of SARS patients require management in intensive care units, and the overall fatality rate has approached 10%. Interestingly, children seem to be relatively resistant to SARS, but the reason for this restriction is not known [2\u20134]. The clinical course of SARS follows three phases [5,6]. In the first phase, there is active viral replication and patients experience systemic symptoms. In the second phase, virus levels start to decrease while antibodies, which are effective in controlling infection, increase. However, pneumonia and immunopathological injury also develop in this phase. Ultimately, in the third phase, fatal cases of SARS progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [1,7]. It has been hypothesized that the pathological changes are caused by a disproportional immune response, illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1\u03b2, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 [8\u201313]. These in vivo data have been confirmed with in vitro experiments, demonstrating that SARS-CoV infection induces a range of cytokines and chemokines in diverse cell types [14\u201319].",

Moreover, no IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 has been detected in the sera of SARS patients or in lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected mice [23\u201325]. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that type I IFN inhibition or delay may be orchestrated by SARS-CoV proteins ORF 3B, ORF 6, and N [26]. The inhibition of IFN production would benefit SARS-CoV replication, since pretreatment of cells with IFN before SARS-CoV infection efficiently prevents replication in these cells [21,27\u201330]. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 reduces SARS-CoV replication in the lungs [31].",

In addition, most if not all virus\u2013host response information is from clinical blood/sera samples that were taken relatively late during infection\u2014little is known about what happens early during infection. Animal studies are of great value to decipher the host's initial innate immune response, without confounding clinical treatment (steroid and mechanical ventilation) or underlying co-morbidity. In order to elucidate early host responses during the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection, we infected cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV and used macaque-specific microarrays and real-time (RT)-PCR techniques to study host gene expression profiles. Adolescent cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV develop DAD similar to SARS patients, but clear most of the virus in the lungs by day 6 [7]. Because SARS-CoV replicates predominantly in the lower respiratory tract of macaques, the virus infects a range of cells, including type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes, that are different from those analyzed in vitro. The ability to simultaneously examine virus replication and host response gene expression profiles in the lungs of these animals during the acute phase of SARS offers the opportunity to further unravel the pathogenesis of SARS.",

No lesions or clinical symptoms were detected on day 1 after SARS-CoV infection, whereas on day 4, three out of four monkeys were lethargic, with one of these animals showing mildly labored breathing. Pathological changes at day 4 post infection included DAD, characterized by flooding of the alveoli with edema fluid, infiltration of neutrophils, damage to the alveolar and bronchial epithelia, and occasional type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, as described earlier [31]. Four mock-infected animals were included in the study to serve as a reference for host response without viral challenge and to examine outbred inter-animal variation. Our previous experience with A/Texas/36/91 influenza virus demonstrated that viral mRNA was detected in representative samples of the lung rather than throughout the whole lung [32].

No viral RNA could be detected in the samples from the mock-infected animals. For gene expression experiments, lung samples from SARS-CoV\u2013infected animals were compared to a reference lung sample from mock-infected animals. The three samples with lower virus levels (1A-low, 4A-low, and 4D-low) were analyzed individually so as not to dilute the gene expression of pooled pulmonary samples with higher SARS-CoV levels and also to potentially further define pulmonary infection. Samples from animals with high viral mRNA levels showed greater gene expression changes (\u223c2,000 genes day 1, \u223c800 genes day 4) compared to samples from animals with low levels of viral mRNA (\u223c400 genes), indicating a response of lung tissue to the virus (Figure 1B).

Hierarchical clustering methods were used to order rows (genes) and columns (samples) to identify groups of genes or samples with similar expression patterns [33,34]. These data were plotted as a heat map in which each matrix entry represents a gene expression value (Figure 2A). Red corresponds to higher gene expression than that of the controls; green corresponds to lower gene expression. This analysis yielded 2,050 genes with day 1 samples on one side of the heat map and day 4 samples on the other side of the heat map, indicating an influence of timing after inoculation. There are two major roots to the hierarchical dendrogram, with the larger root composed of all the day 1 samples and the three day 4 samples with the highest virus levels. The smaller root is composed of the remaining day 4 samples with the lowest SARS-CoV levels. Although transcriptional profiling shows some variation when comparing samples from the same animal, the underlying gene expression is similar with a reduction in fold change in the \u201clow\u201d samples. These comparisons suggest that both individual animal variation and the \u201casynchronous\u201d nature of the infection in the animals' lungs are factors involved in determining transcription of cellular genes. To validate that the host response from infected animals comprises a stronger transcriptional profile than individual variation from mock-infected animals, differential gene expression patterns in the separate mock samples were investigated, but only 38 genes were differentially expressed (Figure 2B). These results suggest that underlying basal levels of gene transcription do not confound expression levels after infection. Even in a basal state, some low-level lung-to-lung variations were identified within the same animal but not enough to disrupt segregation of lung pieces based on mock-infected animals.",

The day 1 set contained 1,278 genes and the day 4 set contained 950 genes. When examining host responses that were similar throughout the course of the infection, the intersection of the day 1 and day 4 sets indicates that 597 genes show shared responses. The heat map of these 597 genes is shown in Figure 3B. If more stringent criteria were used to find common responses in all six animals, using the 1,278 genes from the day 1 set and the 129 genes that are differentially expressed in all day 4 animals, a subset of 97 genes was identified. This subset included IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), like IFITs, MX1, GBP1, and G1P2, and also various chemokines and cytokines, such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), IL-6, and IL-8 (Figure S1). These same cytokines and chemokines have been reported to be up-regulated in human SARS cases [9\u201312]. This set also included cathepsin L (CTSL), which has been shown to be required for SARS-CoV entry into a cell [35]. Even though only 97 genes were commonly regulated in all animals, indicated with blue bars in Figure 3B, the heat map highlights that the other 500 genes show similar expression trends. Both sets of common-response genes showed similar functionality: cellular growth and proliferation, cell death, cellular movement, immune response, and cell-to-cell signaling.",

Not only IFNs, but also several IFN-responsive genes (e.g., G1P2, GBP1/2, IFI/IFITs, MX1/2, ISG20, and OAS1/2/L) were highly transcribed, showing a persistent activation of the innate immune response. Furthermore, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1(SOCS1) is induced at the onset of infection, presumably to establish negative feedback to attenuate cytokine signaling.

Besides previously mentioned chemokines, we detected monocyte chemotactic protein genes like CCL8 (MCP-2) and CCL7 (MCP-3), but also CCL11 (eotaxin), a chemotactic protein for eosinophils. In the samples with low SARS-CoV mRNA levels, the induction of chemokines is less evident, suggesting that the presence of these molecules is restricted to areas in the lung where virus is present.

These IFNs are able to activate STAT1, followed by the transcription of numerous ISGs. Using immunohistochemistry, we revealed that these antiviral signaling pathways were differentially regulated in distinctive subsets of cells. Our results emphasize the strength of combining functional genomics with immunohistochemistry to further unravel the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques.",

All experimental animals showed signs of infection because viral mRNA could be detected in random samples from the lung, indicating that the virus had spread throughout the whole lung at the time of necropsy. Furthermore, pathological examination of SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques at day 4 post infection revealed multifocal DAD [31]. Unlike 10% of humans with SARS, which are mainly restricted to the elderly, adult macaques used in this study do not succumb to SARS-CoV infection. However, the SARS-CoV\u2013induced pathology in these macaques likely resembles the pathological changes seen in the majority of human SARS patients that recover from the disease. Although none of the current animal models has fully reproduced all features of SARS, the most important aspects of this disease are observed in experimentally infected macaques, providing valuable insights into the initial innate immune response after infection without confounding clinical treatment or underlying co-morbidity.",

This strong host response is dominated by genes involved in the immune response and includes a wide range of genes corresponding with what is seen in human ARDS. During the acute phase of human ARDS, activated neutrophils and macrophages enter the alveoli and produce a number of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL10 (IP-10) [36], as were found in the lungs of our SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. Researchers have postulated that these genes also predict adverse SARS patient outcome [37]. During the chronic phase of human ARDS, type 2 pneumocytes start to proliferate and differentiate in order to repair the damaged lung. At day 4, the macaque lung shows similar evidence of lung repair, and numerous genes are up-regulated that are involved in cellular growth and proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and DNA replication and repair. Genes involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation have been previously reported in coronavirus infections other than SARS-CoV and have been characterized by an accumulation of infected cells in the G0/G1 phase [14,38]. We also detected a strong presence of genes involved in the coagulation pathway, including TFPI2, SERPINE1, and TIMP1. The idea of a pro-coagulation profile mimics the clinical-pathological observations of SARS patients that showed unusually disseminated small vessel thromboses in the lungs [5,39]. Additionally, cathepsin L was up-regulated in all SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. Induction of this gene after SARS-CoV infection is quite interesting because cathepsin L is an endosomal protease that is necessary for SARS-CoV to infect a cell [35].",

            "text": "Remarkably, SARS-CoV infection in macaques leads to a strong transcription of IFNs. Not only IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03bb (all type I IFNs), but also IFN-\u03b3, a type II IFN, were all highly up-regulated, especially on day 1 after infection. The expression of IFN-\u03b2, which strongly correlated to the amount of virus present, continued throughout day 4 and was confirmed using immunohistochemistry; IFN-\u03b2\u2013positive cells could be detected in the lungs of the SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. The induction of IFN-\u03b2 in these SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques is surprising, because several reports have shown that SARS-CoV inhibits or delays type I IFN production in a number of cell types [14\u201318,20,22]. For example, SARS-CoV blocks a step in the activation of IRF-3, a transcription factor that is required for IFN-\u03b2 induction [21]. In addition, the SARS-CoV proteins ORF3B, ORF6, and nucleocapsid have been shown to function as IFN antagonists, as has the SARS-CoV nsp1 gene that prevents the production of Sendai virus\u2013induced IFN-\u03b2 in 293 cells [26,40]. Interestingly, it was recently shown that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are able to produce IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 after SARS-CoV infection, while conventional DCs did not produce these type I IFNs [41]. pDCs are known for their ability to produce very high amounts of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 and are considered first-line sentinels in immune surveillance in the lung [42\u201346]. We speculate that the IFN-\u03b2\u2013producing cells detected in the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques are pDCs. Future studies may address the nature of these IFN-producing cells once technical difficulties in detecting pDCs in macaque tissues have been tackled. These studies may also shed light on whether decreasing numbers of pDCs observed in clinical blood samples from human SARS patients are caused by sequestering of pDCs by the lungs, destruction of pDCs by SARS-CoV, or destruction or suppression of pDCs by steroid treatment [47].",

In vitro, SARS-CoV inhibited translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus, and phosphorylation of STAT1 was strongly reduced. However, the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation was not absolute because cells with low levels of phosphorylated STAT1 in their cytoplasm were also detected. In accordance with our data, Kopecky-Bromberg et al. recently showed that the SARS-CoV protein ORF6 is able to inhibit STAT1 translocation [26]. This strategy is not unique to SARS. Other viruses have been shown to be able to block signaling of IFNs by affecting phosphorylation and/or translocation of the STAT proteins. For example, measles virus V protein inhibits translocation of STAT1, but does not affect phosphorylation, whereas measles virus P protein blocks both of these processes [48]. Other paramyxoviruses, like Rinderpest virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and mumps virus, as well as flaviviruses like West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, are able to block activation of STAT1 and STAT2 [49\u201352]. Inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation is not always complete. For example, Sendai virus suppresses tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 during the early stages of infection, but this block becomes leaky after a couple of hours with phosphorylated STAT1 accumulating in the cytoplasm [53].",

Mice clear SARS-CoV in the absence of NK cells, T cells, or B cells, suggesting that innate immune responses are sufficient to limit SARS-CoV infection in these animals [23]. Indeed, STAT1 knock out mice, which are resistant to the effects of IFNs, to some extent show a worsening of pulmonary disease and an increase in viral replication in the lungs compared to normal mice after infection with SARS-CoV [54]. Although IFN treatment was not conducted in SARS-CoV infection mouse studies, prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated IFN-\u03b1 protects type 1 pneumocytes from infection with SARS-CoV [31]. In addition, potent antiviral activity is observed in vitro when cells are treated with IFNs before they are infected with SARS-CoV [27,29,30]. Although we cannot determine the effect of neutralizing IFN-\u03b2 in SARS-CoV\u2013infected animals, based on the experiments utilizing recombinant IFNs in these animals, we postulate that type I IFNs are partly responsible for the relatively mild clinical symptoms that are seen in SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. In addition, a recent study again demonstrated the importance of IFNs in viral infections, as macaques infected with the highly pathogenic and fatal 1918 influenza virus showed limited induction of type I IFNs (only IFNA4 reached fold changes > 5) and delayed induction of ISGs, while macaques infected with the low-pathogenic K173 influenza virus showed a strong induction of these antiviral molecules early during infection [55]. Notably, IFN-\u03b2 was not up-regulated (absolute fold change < 2) in any of the influenza virus\u2013infected animals, even in those animals that recovered, unlike SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques that showed a very strong presence of IFN-\u03b2.",

Furthermore, we show that infection of cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV leads to a strong immune response, including the induction of various cytokines and chemokines, resembling the host response seen in human SARS patients. Strikingly, despite the fact that SARS-CoV infection blocks the production of IFNs in vitro, type I IFNs are strongly induced in the lungs of SARS-CoV\u2013infected macaques. The production of IFN early during infection leads to widespread activation of STAT1 and the production of ISGs. This suggests that, although SARS-CoV blocks IFN signaling in infected cells, locally produced IFNs are capable of activating non-infected cells and possibly can prevent infection of these cells. Thus, SARS-CoV infection in macaques leads to the differential activation of both pathogenic and antiviral signaling pathways in vivo, and the outcome may be determined by the relative contribution of these signaling pathways.",

Virus stocks were generated in Vero E6 cells that were defective in IFN production. Two animals were euthanized on day 1 after infection and four animals were euthanized on day 4. In addition, four animals were mock (PBS) infected and euthanized on day 4, serving as a negative control group. One lung from each monkey was fixed in 10% formalin for histopathology and immunohistochemistry while the other was used for real-time PCR and microarrays. Lung samples were randomly excised from three different lung areas (cranial, medial, caudal) and stored in RNAlater (Ambion, http://www.ambion.com/). Sixteen pieces of lung were taken from the SARS-CoV\u2013infected animals, two to three pieces of lung per animal. Twelve pieces of lung were taken from the mock-infected animals, three pieces of lung per animal. Individual lung samples in RNAlater were transferred to TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen, http://www.invitrogen.com/), homogenized using Polytron PT2100 tissue grinders (Kinematica, http://www.kinematica.ch), and then processed to extract RNA. All experiments were executed under a biosafety level 3, and approval for animal experiments was obtained from the Institutional Animal Welfare Committee.",

The reference mock-infected sample was created by pooling equal mass quantities of total RNA extracted from the 12 individual lung pieces from mock-infected animals. An Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer was used to check the purity of the total RNA prior to cRNA probe production with the Agilent Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification kit (Agilent Technologies, http://www.agilent.com/). Arrays were scanned with an Agilent DNA microarray scanner, and image analysis was performed using Agilent Feature Extractor Software (Agilent Technologies). Each microarray experiment was done with two technical replicates using dye reversal [56]. All data were entered into a custom-designed database (Expression Array Manager) and analyzed with Resolver 4.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware, http://www.rosettabio.com/) and Spotfire DecisionSite for Functional Genomics (Spotfire, http://www.spotfire.com/). In our data analysis, genes were selected to be included for transcriptional profile based on two criteria: a greater than 99.99% probability of being differentially expressed (p \u2264 0.0001) and an expression level change of 2-fold or greater. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, http://www.ingenuity.com/) was used to functionally annotate genes according to biological processes and canonical pathways. In accordance with proposed MIAME standards, primary data are available in the public domain through Expression Array Manager at http://expression.microslu.washington.edu/expression/index.html [57].",
