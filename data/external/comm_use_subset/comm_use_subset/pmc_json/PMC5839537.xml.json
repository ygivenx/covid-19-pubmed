            "text": "The riverine buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is major livestock species of India that plays an important role in agricultural economy due to its dairy, meat and draught potential. It contributes more than half of the total milk production of India [1]. As buffalo is the major livestock species and milk contributor for Indian subcontinent, therefore concerted efforts on genomic and transcriptomic studies to determine gene functions, gene networks and biological pathways for various phenomic traits needs to be strengthened. Understanding expressed genes pattern is critical to provide insights into complex regulatory networks and for identification of genes relevant to new biological processes. Among the array of techniques available, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a well-established and widely used technique to quantify precise mRNA levels of target gene of interest in different biological samples. Due to its several benefits over the conventional methods of measuring RNA, like higher sensitivity, large dynamic range and potential for high throughput, the technique has revolutionized the approach to analyze the gene expression patterns in various fields of biological research [2\u20134]. However the expression data from qPCR studies needs normalization as this technique is prone to analytical variations. To achieve accurate quantification, it is quite essential to take into account the variations that might occur due to differing amount of starting material, pipetting errors, efficiencies of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. Use of internal control genes (ICGs) or reference genes (RGs) with constant expression level between samples in response to experimental treatment or physiological state, are now considered as effective method for normalization of transcriptional data to account for the experimental variations. This approach has been widely used in different cell types and tissues in various species [5\u20137]. In past though, trend was to use only single reference gene; mostly GAPDH, ACTB or 18S rRNA to normalize the real time PCR data. However, now it is an established notion that for each experimental set-up, proper evaluation of multiple RGs is crucial to avoid variations and use of single reference gene for normalization of qPCR data is inappropriate [8]. Therefore, number of studies have successfully been conducted to identify least regulated and stably expressed RGs [9\u201311] across tissues of various species such as human, pig, sheep, bovines etc [12\u201318]. To our knowledge, not much information is available on set of suitable reference genes that can be used in lactation or physiological studies in riverine buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) although few studies have been performed in specific cell types/tissues [19\u201321]. Considering the fact that choice of suitable reference/RGs genes is crucial for accurate expression profiling of target genes, this study presents the information on panel of appropriate RGs across 12 buffalo tissues. Such information will be a useful resource to normalize the qPCR based expression data generated across tissues during various physiological or metabolic studies in riverine buffaloes.",

After extraction, RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and then subsequently followed by on-column digestion with the RNase-free DNase (Qiagen). The RNA was quantified using Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). RNA integrity was confirmed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis as well as checking the RIN value of representative RNA samples using experion Bioanalyser (BioRad, USA). The RNA samples were stored at -80\u00b0C till further use. First strand cDNA was synthesized using 100ng RNA as described in our previous studies [7,19] using the program: 25\u00b0C for 5 min, 50\u00b0C for 60 min, and 70\u00b0C for 15 min. cDNA was then diluted 1:4 (v:v) with DNase/RNase free water. Sufficient cDNA was prepared in a single run to perform the qPCR experiments for all selected genes. The primer details for reference genes are given in Table 1. Primers specificity was confirmed in 20 \u03bcL PCR reaction using the similar protocol as described for qPCR except for the final dissociation protocol. 5 \u03bcL of the PCR product was run in a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The accuracy of primer pairs was also ensured by the presence of a unique peak during the dissociation step at the end of qPCR. PCR efficiency (E) for each primer pair was calculated on the basis of slope of standard curve using equation: E = 10(1/-slope).",

The geNorm software defines the gene stability value (M value) by comparing the pairwise variations among the reference genes. In addition, pair wise variation analysis (V values) was carried out using geNorm to select optimal number of RGs to be used for normalization of expression data across buffalo tissues. The contribution of each gene to the variance of normalization factor ratio was calculated to illustrate the effect of adding or removing a particular gene from the final set of RGs. NormFinder algorithm ranks the reference genes by calculating the intra and inter- group variations of expression of each of the reference genes. The BestKeeper analysis included calculation of crossing point standard deviations [{SD, \u00b1CP} <1] and results were displayed as standard deviation (S.D) and coefficient of variance (C.V).

The M-value ranged from 0.9707 (RPS9 and UXT) to 1.7362 (RPS15) (Table 2). The overall expression stability criteria ranked RPS9 and UXT as most stable genes.

The analysis showed that V2/V3 combination gave slightly higher V value (0.304) than the acceptable limit (recommended cut off value of 0.15) (Fig 3). However, with the addition of RPS23 in V3/V4 gene combination, some drop in V value was observed (0.228). Though this value was also little higher than the standard acceptable V value, however considering the 12 diverse type of tissues evaluated in the study, the value of 0.228 was considered to be in acceptable range. Few studies [25\u201327] have also indicated slightly higher V value. In our opinion, for studies handling diverse sample types, V value \u2264 0.15 should be considered as a suggestive threshold criteria and not necessarily a universal cut-off criteria in deciding the number of genes to be used to calculate normalization factor. The V value threshold vary according to the biological system and type of samples being evaluated. Therefore, we used the lowest Vn/n+1 value (0.228) to determine the number of RGs adequate for normalization.

Similarly identification of stable reference genes for transcriptional studies in bulls distinctive in meat quality [5] and in buffalo muscle tissue [31] were also reported. Terzi and coworkers [32] have followed a different approach wherein, EST transcripts from publicly available Bos taurus database were evaluated across different tissues of water buffaloes. In their study, they could identify ribosomal proteins L4, L5 and Gek protein encoding genes as stably expressed transcripts and suggested them to be used as normalizers to compare gene expression levels across buffalo tissues.",

Our present data has demonstrated that 2 or more reference genes should be used to validate expression data across buffalo tissues. The results of the present study have provided panel of references that can be utilized during gene expression studies across as well as individual buffalo tissue. In conclusion, UXT, RPS23, RPL4, and RPS9 were most stable and appropriate reference genes identified across buffalo tissues and their geometric means would provide accurate normalization factor for expression data in buffalo tissues.",
