All samples that were originally tested with RespiFinder 19 were subsequently tested for bocavirus with primers specific for this virus.

Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia have increased rates that coincide when respiratory viruses are more prevalent19 Consistent with previous studies, we found that RSV was highly associated with hospitalizations, appearing to cause worse ILI outcomes when compared to single PIV, RV/EV, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza infections. Metapneumovirus (hMPV), though less common than RSV (9.7% and 24.7%, respectively) was more prevalent in our study than others had previously reported (4\u20105.5%).20 hMPV was significantly associated with hospitalization; however, its ORs were generally smaller than those of RSV. We also found that a delayed visit to the doctor was more common among patients that required hospitalization. This finding underscores the importance of educating the public about seeking medical care soon after symptom onset to prevent more severe ILI outcomes. The higher relative severity of RSV and hMPV infections probably reflects their greater capacity to cause lower respiratory tract disease in young infants. Longitudinal studies have shown that 22.4% of children suffer RSV\u2010associated lower respiratory infection during the first year of life21 Wheezing has been reported in 10% of children with hMPV infections22 and is also associated to hypoxia and fever20\n",

A reduction in the proportion of influenza\u2010associated hospitalizations and mortality in Mexican children <5 years of age was reported after the inclusion of the influenza vaccine for routine immunization in 2004.23, 24 While some information about influenza vaccination was collected during recruitment into this study, the data were not detailed enough to thoroughly investigate the impact of vaccination on ILI\u2010associated hospitalizations. Coinfections with viral (influenza and RSV) and bacterial (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus aureus) have previously been reported to cause severe ILI outcomes.25, 26 While we would have liked to investigate the relationship between viral and bacterial coinfections, the number of children in our study with these types of infections was too small to analyze. When influenza virus is circulating and the incidence of severe lower respiratory tract infections begins to increase, clinicians should consider empirical treatment for influenza and antibiotic therapy.",

Because few studies of bocavirus infections have included control groups, the disease burden associated to this virus is still unclear.\n31\n Thus, additional research is required to define the pathogenic potential of this virus.",

Nevertheless, the ILI definition that we used allowed for the inclusion of a broad range of clinical presentations, and, therefore, it is likely that this data might be of help for assessment of patients that seek acute medical care. We acknowledge that the decision to seek medical attention in a hospital (rather than in a primary care clinic) could be related to the perceived severity of the illness, potentially biasing our study population. As our study was primarily hospital based, the absolute rates of hospitalized vs outpatients are likely skewed towards those that present to a hospital for care of the ILI. However, we believe that the place of choice for medical attention would not confound the risk for hospitalization among those with severe ILI, regardless of the infectious agent should not influence the relative proportions of hospitalization between viruses.",
