We performed lung aspirate culture and PCR as well as blood culture; most studies of pneumonia aetiology have previously only used blood culture to identify bacterial aetiologies. Lung aspiration was performed in a select group of children with pneumonia (22%), therefore our findings do not necessarily represent the spectrum of aetiology of radiological pneumonia in this population. Selecting only children with focal, lobar or segmental consolidation meant that most cases of PcP were likely to be excluded, which probably accounts for the lower overall case fatality rate in our study than has been reported in comparable studies [11]. The median age of our group was higher than that of children with pneumonia presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital [11]; pathogens that commonly occur in infants such as RSV and PcP may therefore be under-represented in our study. Lung aspirate PCR was only designed to identify a small number of bacteria, and did not identify Gram negative organisms such as Klebsiella or non-typhoidal salmonella. Validated PCR assays for Klebsiella or non-typhoidal salmonella or Staphylococcus aureus were not available in our laboratory.",

            "text": "The finding that PCR was much more sensitive than culture in children who had lung aspiration performed is likely to reflect the frequent use of antibiotics prior to presentation as well as the inherent increased sensitivity of the test over culture. The fact that urine was not tested for antibiotic activity may have resulted in a significant under-reporting of previous antibiotic exposure, and may have contributed to the low culture positivity rate despite positive bacterial PCR. An organism identified in a sample obtained directly from consolidated lung is more likely to be the causative agent than are organisms retrieved from samples such as from nasopharyngeal aspirates and even from bronchoalveolar lavage because of the risk of contamination of these samples with carriage isolates [8]. Nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus is very common among well infants in regions such as Malawi [12]. A limitation of RT-PCR compared to culture is that it does not provide antibiotic susceptibility data. Serotype data can now be provided from lung aspirate samples using Luminex technology [13], or PCR [14], [15] but these assays were not available to us at the time of the study.",

There are seven deaths reported from 6001 lung aspirates, a mortality of approximately 1 in 850, although the deaths were not thought to be directly attributable to lung aspiration [4]. Our data are consistent with a study from Finland using lung aspirate for the diagnosis of childhood pneumonia, in which lung aspirate disclosed the aetiology in 59% [6]. That study however had a significantly higher complication rate, with pneumothorax developing in 18% of children, compared with the complication rate in our study of 2%. It must be emphasized that lung aspiration is not recommended in a child suspected to be suffering from PcP, because of the increased risk of pneumothorax [16].

This has led to the debate as to whether HBoV is a true pathogen or an innocent bystander. A recent study by Don et al. [19] suggests that the host immune system recognises HBoV as a pathogen by eliciting significant antibody responses. HBoV has also been associated with pneumonia requiring hospitalization in young children in Thailand [20]. Our study is the first study to report HBoV detection in lung aspirate samples in children with radiological pneumonia, strongly suggesting that the infection arose from the lower airways as opposed to merely colonising the nasopharynx. A recent study from Finland found high concentrations of HBoV in induced sputum, also suggesting that the virus may have originated from the lower airways [21].",

In that study, 4.7%of children were bacteraemic, compared to 15% in our study. In another recent study from Mozambique, 49% of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from children under 5 years with severe pneumonia had at least one respiratory virus detected by PCR [23]. Viral infection was more prevalent in HIV-infected children, and in-hospital mortality was highest in children with invasive bacterial co-infection and HIV infection [23]. Given that all the children reported in these studies fulfilled the WHO criteria for severe pneumonia, and would therefore have received parenteral antibiotics, there is now an urgent need for reliable, affordable point of care diagnostics to help differentiate bacterial from viral aetiologies in an attempt to promote judicious antibiotic prescribing. We previously reported the performance of five diagnostic biomarkers to predict serious bacterial infection (SBI) in African children [24]. In the current study reported here, median C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels on admission were significantly higher in children with confirmed bacterial pneumonia than in children with pneumonia without bacterial confirmation, but there was a degree of overlap (data not shown). A larger study assessing the performance of biomarkers of SBI in all children presenting with severe pneumonia is now indicated, augmented by molecular diagnostic testing to enhance diagnosis of bacterial infection. This will allow a more accurate prediction of the utility of biomarkers to guide antibiotic prescribing.",
