            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-strand plus RNA viruses, which belong to the order Nidovirales. CoVs normally infect epithelial cells such as respiratory epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells and kidney epithelial cells, which causes respiratory or intestinal tract diseases with various levels of severity [1,2]. Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a main cause of the common cold, while severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory disease that can be life-threatening to humans [3,4,5]. However, some CoVs-like mouse hepatitis virus John Howard Mueller strain (MHV-JHM) infect oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia and cause acute encephalomyelitis [6,7]. Additionally, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) can also reach the central nervous system (CNS) by intranasal inoculation in BALB/c mice, which causes encephalitis [8,9,10,11]. The release of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is closely associated with encephalitis [12]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the gamma-coronavirus group (\u03b3-CoV), which causes a highly contagious, acute viral respiratory disease of chickens that has caused great economic losses in the poultry industry. At present, QX-type IBV is epidemic worldwide; it can damage the respiratory, digestive and urogenital systems of chickens [13,14,15,16]. Besides, because of severe damage of respiratory mucosa, infected chickens are susceptible to secondary infection by mycoplasma, bacteria, or other pathogens causing high mortality.",

            "text": "All CoV virions encode a set of four structural proteins, namely; spike glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid proteins (N) [17,18]. S protein belongs to the class I fusion proteins, located at the surface of the virion [19]. The trimeric S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein and mediates attachment to the host receptor. S is typically cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease into two separate polypeptides named S1 and S2. S1 makes up the large receptor-binding domain of the S protein, while S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule [20]. There is an extra furin cleavage site (furin-S2\u2032 site) upstream of the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit of some CoVs, which has been reported to influence the mechanism of invasion of host cells by CoVs. When the original sequence PTKR/S of SARS-CoV was replaced with RRKR/S, SARS-CoV could invade susceptible cells while no longer relying on cathepsin L [21]. Additionally, after the S2\u2032 site mutated into the furin-S2\u2032 site of the MHV-A59 strain, MHV can fuse with susceptible cells in the early endosome, but not lysosome, without requiring lysosomal enzymes such as MERS-CoV [22]. As for IBV, the furin-S2\u2032 site is a determinant of cellular adaptation of the IBV-Beaudette strain. If this motif is lacking, the IBV-Beaudette strain, which is normally the only IBV strain able to adapt to the Vero cell line, can no longer grow in these cells [23,24,25].",

Serial passage was executed until the stable appearance of dwarf embryos and the time of death of embryos was recorded. The 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50) was determined by inoculating serial 10-fold dilutions of allantoic fluid into SPF chicken embryos [29].

One-day-old SPF chicks inoculated with the rYN strain began to show clinical signs of sneezing and listlessness at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). One chick died in the rYN-inoculated observation group during the experiment\u2019s observation period, conferring a mortality rate of 10%, while chicks in the rYN-S2/RRKR-inoculated group began to show clinical signs of diarrhea and unexpectedly neurological signs such as head tremor and paralysis. Nine out of 10 chicks infected with rYN-S2/RRKR during the observation period; the mortality was 90% (Figure 2A, left panel). The survival results showed that the furin-S2\u2032 site clearly increased the lethality of the rYN strain to 1-day-old SPF chickens. Interestingly, furin-S2\u2032 site induction caused neurological signs that have never previously been reported. At necropsy of 1-day-old SPF chicks at 5, 7 and 9 dpi, there were obvious lesions in the respiratory and urinary systems of chicks inoculated with the rYN strain, including mucus and punctate hemorrhage in the larynx, substantial urate deposits in the ureter and kidney swelling.

For \u03b3-CoVs, whose representative virus is IBV, the furin-S2\u2032 site is the determinant of adaptation to Vero cells of the IBV-Beaudette strain. In the absence of this site, the IBV-Beaudette strain no longer grows in these cells. Our results confirmed that the furin-S2\u2032 site plays an important role in the pathogenicity of IBV, besides adaptation to its host cell.

Additionally, neutrophils contribute to defense through the release of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), which helps increase the permeability of the BBB, resulting in an increase of specific T cells infiltrating into the CNS [33]. As for another neurotropic coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, astrogliosis and microgliosis are observed when it infects the brain [10]. A similar mutation was also observed in the S protein of HCoV-OC43, of which a furin-like cleavage site appeared at amino acid 758 between the S1 and S2 portions [34,35]. Conversely, this mutation leads to decreased neurovirulence and limited dissemination within the CNS. Our data from pathogenicity experiments clearly show that IBV with the furin-S2\u2032 site can infect neurons and cause encephalitis, which has never previously been reported in IBV. Our results extend previous work on the function of the S protein of coronavirus. Based on this, we used homologous modeling to predict the structure of original and mutant S proteins according to the structure of IBV S protein (PDB accession number: 6CV0) (Figure 6) [36]. We found that the S2\u2032 site is located on the surface of the S protein and can be modified by furin. We speculate that modification by furin may affect the fusion of virus with cells, which mildly damages the trachea and kidney; meanwhile, IBV with mutant S protein can infect neurons.",
