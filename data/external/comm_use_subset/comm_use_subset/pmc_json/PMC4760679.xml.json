The average annual incidence of influenza-associated hospitalizations is particularly high in children <5 years of age [12, 13], greatly promoting the development of vaccination strategies. The findings of a population-based study indicated that the influenza-associated disease burden on young children were mainly derived from outpatients, involved a high attendance rate, common complications, and immeasurable missed work/absenteeism, followed by influenza-associated hospitalizations, and death-related disease burden caused by influenza was comparatively low [14]. Studies to date have been primarily performed in developed temperate countries, as well as in a few high-income districts in tropical and subtropical countries [2, 4, 10]. However, basic data on influenza burden are lacking for most tropical and subtropical countries owing to lagging health-care facilities, monitoring, and information collection systems [15].",

In the temperate regions of Europe and America, the influenza activity has a distinct seasonal pattern, with a winter epidemic peak and almost no activity during the other seasons. In subtropical areas such as Guangdong Province in south China, however, influenza activity occurs throughout the year, presenting a vague seasonality that makes it more difficult to use mathematical models that are frequently adopted in temperate areas [13, 16]. Studies on the influenza burden and the findings in temperate regions cannot be directly applied to (sub) tropical areas because of local features and population-specific attributes. In recent years, research on influenza-related hospitalizations conducted in central China has shown that a seasonal influenza epidemic causes a substantial number of hospitalizations [17], with an estimated 115\u2013142 patients with severe acute respiratory infections per 100 000 hospitalizations attributed to influenza. However, the degree of impact of influenza in subtropical southern China has yet to be reported.",

The established core models were as follows [3, 5]:\nYt~Poisson(\u03bct)E(Yt)=\u03bctVar(Yt)=\u03d5\u03bctlogE(Yt)=\u03b1+f(t)+q(zt)(1)\nwhere Yt is the dependent variable, the number of deaths per week; \u03bct is the expected mean,Yt; \u03d5 is the over-dispersion parameter (given \u03d5 is equal to 1, the outcome perfectly follows Poisson distribution. \u03d5 more than 1 means over-dispersion and the variance is modified by multiplying \u03d5); \u03b1 is the intercept; f is a smooth function with respect to the time variable t; zt is a time-varying variable that can be monitored, for example, meteorological factors such as temperature and relative humidity; and q is a smooth function of zt, for which the cubic spline smoothing function is adopted. Each smooth function has a parameter (e.g., degrees of freedom) that needed to be adjusted to choose the best model. The white noise of residual distribution and non-statistically significant autocorrelation of the partial autocorrelation function was required for the model. Only conditions that met the above criteria could be considered sufficient for controlling the confounding factors. If multiple models met the above criteria, then we chose the smallest function value as the optimal model by using Akaike information criteria. If the residual partial autocorrelation plot always showed significant autocorrelations regardless of model parameter adjustment, the autoregressive term was introduced to establish the autocorrelation regression model for correction.",

The mortality rate recorded in the death database is likely lower than the real situation for the following reasons: first, only a small number of patients with suspected influenza infections (especially adult patients) underwent virological testing; additionally, even in patients who were evaluated etiologically and ultimately died, the death certificates rarely listed influenza as the underlying cause of death owing to the doctors\u2019 self-protection and other reasons [27]. The United States Centers for Disease Control and other researchers have stated that influenza mortality reflects a certain influence on patients who died of influenza but seriously underestimates the disease burden and that an appropriate statistical model is needed to estimate the full impact of influenza.

The results showed that ILI had a substantial effect on the number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Four percent of outpatient visits were attributable to ILI, whereas 7% of hospitalized patients\u2019 diseases were associated with ILI and 17% of respiratory disease deaths were related to ILI. In addition to the influenza virus, many respiratory viruses (such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus) and bacteria can cause ILI [29, 31], the epidemic seasons of which often overlap with those of influenza.
