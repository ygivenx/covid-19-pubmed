Owing to their role as a source of affordable, live or freshly slaughtered animals, LAMs act as a source for transmission of pathogens, especially viruses.1, 2, 3 Spread of a virus within the market is often enhanced due to high density, close contact animal housing, increasing the risk of zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission.4 Animals remain in the LAM for extended periods of time until sold and can consequently transform these markets into viral reservoirs. As new animals are introduced to the LAM, Infected animals easily transmit viruses to these na\u00efve hosts, thus perpetuating and amplifying viral circulation.5 In addition, LAMs are often part of a larger marketplace ecosystem, potentially exposing people to zoonotic pathogens with little to no direct contact with infected animals.1 This is especially true with avian influenza viruses (AIV).",

            "text": "LAMs in many parts of the world harbor highly pathogenic as well as low pathogenic AIV, which can spread asymptomatically through poultry and are difficult to detect without routine surveillance.6, 7, 8, 9 Although AIV has been detected in North American and Caribbean LAMs, there is no information about South America LAMs,10, 11 likely due to minimal surveillance.12 During active surveillance at the largest LAM in Medellin, Colombia, we isolated two H11N2 viruses from asymptomatic birds. At the peak of the occurrence, 17.0% of the birds in the market tested positive. Genetically, the circulating virus was most similar to viruses isolated from North American migratory birds and to viruses isolated in 2013 from Chilean shorebirds. H11 viruses are distributed worldwide10, 13, 14, 15 primarily in wild ducks and shorebirds16, 17 but rarely are found in domestic poultry.9, 10, 18, 19, 20 Given this unique occurrence and the fact that H11 have been reported to cause human infections21, 22 we characterized the viruses in vitro and in vivo. The Colombian H11 viruses displayed no molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals and had an \u03b12,3-sialic acid binding preference. They replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens, explaining the spread throughout the market, but caused little morbidity in Balb/c mice. The genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from South American shorebirds suggests that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover. These findings highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America, especially in areas of high-risk, such as LAMs.",

The Colombian H11N2 viruses are virtually identical; thus, only A/Helmeted guineafowl/Colombia/2/2015 (HGF/Colombia) was used. In brief, groups of 8-week-old, specific-pathogen-free chickens (n=5/virus) were inoculated by natural route with Duck/Mem, RT/DE, BNS/Chile and HGF/Colombia and monitored for clinical signs of infection. After 24 h, na\u00efve birds (n=5) were housed with infected animals to monitor transmission. Cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for 12 days pi to monitor viral shed. Although none of the chickens exhibited clinical signs of disease, 100% of those inoculated with HGF/Colombia had cloacal shedding by day 2 pi with viral titers ranging from 104.5 to 106.5 EID50/mL at day 4 pi (Table 4). Chickens inoculated with the other H11 viruses also shed virus at similar titers at the peak of infection but cleared virus by day 10 pi while the HGF/Colombia virus did not clear until day 12. Similarly, HGF/Colombia infected birds exhibited oropharyngeal shedding with viral titers peaking at 103\u2013104.5 EID50/mL by day 2 pi with clearance by day 8 pi. Intriguingly, only the Colombian virus transmitted to 60% of the contact animals by day 4 pi (Table 4). This transmission also explains the viral spread throughout the market.",

Phylogenic and sequence analysis of all gene segments showed their similarity to wild bird viruses of North American origin, similar to other H11 viruses obtained in Central and South America to date.15, 45, 46 However, unlike other poultry adapted AIVs, the N2 protein displayed a full-length stalk region.47, 48 The conservation of the stalk sequence implies that at the time of sampling there was still no significant adaptation of the H11N2 in Galliformes in spite of its transmission amongst domestic poultry at the LAM. However, future sampling efforts may pick up adaptations if these viruses continue to circulate in the LAM. Lack of significant adaptation suggests that this outbreak occurred from a recent introduction by wild birds into poultry.49 Interestingly, despite having the majority of characteristics of a wild bird virus, HGF/Colombia, efficiently replicated in poultry and was able to transmit to na\u00efve contact animals, indicating a potential risk for poultry in the region.",

            "text": "Epidemiologically, it is extremely difficult to determine the origin of the LAM H11 viruses for several reasons. First, birds at LAM are received from commercial and backyard poultry farms located throughout Medellin and the surrounding cities, but can occasionally be imported from other provinces throughout the country. Furthermore, birds are housed in close contact and sick animals are not separated from healthy ones. The combination of multiple sources of birds, constant influx of animals and close contact make it very hard to trace the origin of the infection. One possible explanation is that the virus was introduced at the LAM in situ. Doves and passerines feeding on leftover grains are commonplace throughout the market and could act as potential carriers of AIV.50 Alternatively, many of the birds for sale at the LAM are raised in backyard flocks that are often exposed to wild birds,51 and could have therefore carried the virus to the LAM. As this is the first study to observe AIV in a South American LAM, future studies aimed at clarifying transmission dynamics within the markets are needed. Importantly, they should involve sampling feral birds at the LAM as well as the screening of poultry on their arrival to the market. Environmental screening of cages, floors and equipment as well as abiotic factors, like temperature and humidity, could also provide important information as to whether these contribute to the spread and maintenance of AIV in South American LAM. Our results also indicate that guineafowls and turkeys had higher odds to be infected by AIV at the LAM compared with chickens and could therefore act as sentinel species in further studies.",

The majority grew inefficiently in mammalian cell lines and replicated poorly in the murine respiratory tract. With the exception of the Chilean H11 virus, little to no morbidity and absolutely no mortality was observed suggesting minimal risk. Interestingly, the Chilean and Colombian H11 isolates show different characteristics in terms of avian transmissibility as well as mammalian replication and pathogenesis. However, these viruses have very few genetic differences aside from minor changes in the polymerase and different NA subtypes. Therefore, these viruses warrant further exploration to better understand the mechanisms of H11 AIV infection in birds and mammals.",

However, these viruses may not need immediate intervention due to the lack of continued viral detection after the LAM outbreak and reduced risk for mammalian infection.
