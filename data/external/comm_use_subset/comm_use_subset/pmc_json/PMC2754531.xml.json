IBV is a highly infectious pathogen of domestic fowl that replicates primarily in the respiratory tract but also in epithelial cells of other organs, including the gut, kidney and oviduct [12]\u2013[14], and is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis, a disease that is responsible for economic losses in the poultry industry throughout the world [15].",

IBV has a 27.6 kb RNA genome and like all coronaviruses contains the four structural proteins; spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), integral membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) which interacts with the genomic RNA. All coronaviruses also encode a set of accessory protein genes of unknown function that are not required for replication in vitro\n[17]\u2013[23], but may play a role in pathogenesis [19], [22]. IBV encodes two accessory genes, genes 3 and 5, which both express two accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b, respectively. In addition to the structural and accessory genes, two-thirds of a coronavirus genome comprises the replicase gene, which expresses two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, in which pp1ab is an extension product of pp1a as a result of a -1 ribosomal shift mechanism. The two polyproteins are cleaved by two types of virus-encoded proteinases usually resulting in 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16); IBV lacks Nsp1 thereby encoding Nsp2-16.",

As a consequence of this process the virus becomes more adapted for the embryo, reflected by more efficient replication and higher pathogenicity for the embryo, with concomitant attenuation for chickens and in some cases loss of immunogenicity. However, the mutations associated with attenuation of pathogenicity for the chicken are unknown and variable leading to differing efficacies associated with different vaccines.",

Briefly, 50% confluent monolayers of vero cells were infected with rVV-BeauR-Rep-\u0394Struct, containing the Beau-R cDNA sequence, at a MOI of 0.2 and transfected 2 h later with 5 \u00b5g of pGPT-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-3UTR in lipofectin (Invitrogen). Resultant phenotypically GPT+ rVVs were selected by three rounds of plaque purification using vero cells in the presence of 25 \u00b5g/ml mycophenolic acid (MPA), 250 \u00b5g/ml xanthine and 15 \u00b5g/ml hypoxanthine. Randomly selected MPA resistant rVVs were grown and plaque purified three times using vero cells in the absence of selection medium. This resulted in a second recombination event (see Fig. 1) involving the loss of the GPT gene from the rVVs, and either generation of an IBV cDNA corresponding to the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-\u0394Struct or a full-length IBV cDNA consisting of a Beau-R replicase gene and the rest of the IBV genome derived from IBV M41-CK within the VV genome (Fig. 1). PCR was used to confirm the absence of the GPT gene in resulting rVVs, which were further screened by PCR amplification of the IBV 3\u2032-UTR, using oligonucleotides BG56 (5\u2032-26941CAACAGCGCCCAAAGAAG26958\n) and 93/100 (5\u2032-27607GCTCTAACTCTATACTAGCCT27587-3\u2032), part of the replicase gene, using oligonucleotides BG40 (5\u2032-18941ATCTAATTTGCTCGTTCA18958-3\u2032 and BG128 (5\u2032-19720CGCCACTCCTTTGTCGCTTC19739-3\u2032, and the junction of the replicase and S genes using oligonucleotides BG40 (5\u2032-18941ATCTAATTTGCTCGTTCA18958-3\u2032 and BG134 (5\u2032-21398AGCAATTGAAACTGAAAGTG21417-3\u2032. Oligonucleotides BG-56 and 93/100 were used to discriminate between the 3\u2032-UTRs from Beau-R and M41 derived sequences; the 3\u2032-UTR from Beau-R results in a 667 bp product but a 483 bp PCR from M41-CK, due to a 184 nt deletion in the M41 3\u2032-UTR.

As can be seen from figure 3, M41-CK induced high rates of snicking, which peaked by day 5 post-inoculation, whereas Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 induced a much lower rate of snicking, similar to those observed for the mock-inoculated chickens (Fig. 3A). Similarly, only chickens (11\u201316%) inoculated with M41-CK showed any nasal discharge three, four and six days post-inoculation (Fig. 3B). Again, wheezing was only observed in chickens inoculated with M41-CK, in which 90% of the infected chickens demonstrated wheezing by 7 days post-inoculation (Fig. 3C). Analysis of the tracheas isolated from the chickens showed that the mock, Beau-R and rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 infected chickens had >95% ciliary activity whereas the chickens inoculated with M41-CK showed 0% ciliary activity (100% ciliostasis; Fig. 3D). In summary, our observations of the parameters used to assess pathogenicity demonstrated that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not pathogenic and that it had the characteristics associated with Beau-R rather than M41-CK.",

Our previous results had shown that Beau-R was not reliably detected in the tracheas of Beau-R in infected chickens whereas M41-CK is detectable [26], [43]. To check for the presence of M41-CK-, Beau-R- or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-derived RNA in the tracheal epithelial cells from the infected chickens, total RNA was isolated from the epithelial cells and analysed by RT-PCR using oligonucleotides BG56 and 93/100, corresponding to the 3\u2032-UTR of the IBV genomes. As can be seen from Fig. 4, the tracheal epithelial cells isolated from chickens infected with M41-CK were positive for the presence of M41-CK-derived RNA. In contrast, no IBV-derived RNA was detected in the tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with either Beau-R or rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 supporting our virus isolation data. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the IBV-derived RT-PCR product amplified from the tracheal epithelial cells of chickens infected with M41-CK confirmed that it was derived from IBV M41-CK. This was consistent with previous results suggesting that Beau-R probably does not reach the tracheas of chickens infected by the eye-drop and intranasal routes and that similarly rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 did not appear to reach the epithelial cells of the tracheas of infected chickens. A rIBV, BeauR-M41(S) [24], which consisted of the Beau-R genome but with an M41-derived S gene, had the tropism of M41 in vitro but the characteristics of Beau-R in vivo indicating, together with our rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 result, that the inability of Beau-R-derived viruses to reach the tracheas of infected chickens resides within the replicase gene.",

Previous work demonstrated that our rIBVs, Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S), caused ciliostasis of infected TOCs with concomitant production of progeny virus [26]. Analysis of tracheal epithelial cells from chickens infected with rIBV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 had shown that there was no virus present. Therefore, we decided to investigate the replication of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2, for comparison with Beau-R and M41-CK, ex vivo in TOCs. Progeny viruses in TOC medium taken from each group of infected TOCs at the specific time points were titrated by plaque assay on CK cells to investigate the growth kinetics of the three IBVs in TOCs. As can be seen from Fig. 5 all three viruses replicated in the TOCs. Although the viruses reached maximum titres by 24 h post-infection, the titre of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was between 1-2 log10 units lower than the titres observed for M41-CK and Beau-R, respectively, at this and most later time points. Interestingly, although rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 replicated and produced progeny virus in TOCs there was no observable ciliostasis when compared to the growth of Beau-R and M41-CK.",

We routinely use the P3-derived rIBVs so that there is a lower probability that changes will have occurred within the virus genome, as with other positive strand RNA viruses multiple passage will result in changes in both nucleotides and amino acids; for example the acquisition of the extra adenosine residue in rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-12. The rIBV, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2, showed slightly reduced growth properties when compared with both parental viruses, Beau-R and M41-CK. Surprisingly, although rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 grew in TOCs it did not cause ciliostasis, which is induced by both parental viruses. Due to the chimaeric nature of the rIBV the 5\u2032-UTR, including the leader sequence, corresponds to Beau-R, with the 3\u2032-UTR derived from M41-CK. There are known nucleotide differences in these regions of the IBV genome between the two viruses ([33], [42]. This introduces the possibility that if the two UTRs interact this could affect the growth properties of the recombinant viruses. As there are only 7 and 3 nucleotide difference between the 5\u2032-UTR and the conserved region of the 3\u2032-UTR, respectively, from Beau-R and M41-CK we decided to serially passage rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 25 times on CK cells to see whether this would result in a virus with a higher growth rate and that could cause ciliostasis in TOCs and to determine in the P25-derived virus whether this was a result of any nucleotide substitutions in either of the UTRs or any other region of the genome that may account for any potential change in phenotype.",

No nucleotide changes were found within the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR sequences of the rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 virus indicating that the change in growth pattern was not due to one of the two UTRs changing to the other parental sequence. As a result of this finding we sequenced the complete rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 genomic sequence and identified only three other nucleotide changes (Table 1) in addition to those identified within rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3. These new nucleotide differences corresponded to a single amino acid change in the S gene and two nucleotide changes within ORF 5b of gene 5 when comparing the M41-CK-derived sequences within rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 and rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 sequences; indicating that these changes arose on further passage of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3. The two nucleotide changes within the ORF 5b sequence, nucleotides 25815 and 25816 (UU\u2192AA), resulted in the introduction of a premature stop codon in ORF 5b and a modification of the N gene transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) from UUCUUAACAA to AACUUAACAA, the latter sequence being the more predominant IBV TRS. Sequence analysis of the rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 viruses between passages P3 and P25 (Fig. 7) indicated that at P5, the AA mutation was more prominent than the parental (UU) sequence and that in subsequent viruses, derived from passages P10, P15, P20 and P25, the original parental sequence gradually decreased and disappeared from detection.",

Although our results showed swapping of the S gene did not result in virulence we could not rule out the fact that other IBV structural (E, M and N) and accessory (3a, 3b, 5a and 5b) genes may also play a role and therefore be required for the acquisition of virulence. We therefore decided to exchange the region of the Beau-R genome from the end of the replicase gene to the poly(A) tail with the corresponding sequence from M41-CK to investigate whether exchange of the structural and accessory genes was sufficient to confer pathogenicity to a resultant chimaeric rIBV, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct. Such an approach would also allow us to determine whether or not the replicase gene plays a role in the pathogenicity of IBV. IBV Beaudette is a well known apathogenic lab strain of IBV that was attenuated by multiple, several hundred, passages in 11-day-old embryonic chicks [30], therefore loss of virulence could have resulted in multiple changes throughout the genome. IBV Beau-R is a molecular clone of Beaudette-CK [35]) that is also avirulent in chickens [26].",

We have used our IBV reverse genetics system [24], [25], [35] to produce chimaeric IBV, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct, consisting of the replicase gene from Beaudette (Beau-R) and the S, 3a, 3b, E, M, 5a, 5b, N and the 3\u2032-UTR from M41-CK. The M41-CK-derived structural and accessory gene sequence was fused to the Beau-R replicase by homologous recombination using the TDS method [25], [37] and rIBVs were rescued in CKCs. The M41-CK-derived region, in addition to the structural and accessory genes in common with Beau-R, also contains an untranslated region, the intergenic untranslated region (IGR), between the M and gene 5, which is 305 nt in Beaudette and 350 nt in M41-CK. The M41-CK IGR, like some other strains of IBV, contains a potential open reading frame (ORF) of 285 nt potentially encoding a 94 amino acid product of 11 kD with the initiation codon immediately downstream of the M gene stop codon. A similar ORF has been identified at a similar position in the genome of turkey coronavirus (TCoV) [5], [6], the only TRS identified for TCoV is 288 nt upstream of the potential ORF, within the M gene, but with low identity to the TCoV canonical TRS. No sg mRNA for this potential ORF has been identified in TCoV or IBV, including M41-CK, infected cells. The lack of a sg mRNA, the long distance between the initiation codon and a potential TRS and the loss of the potential ORF, as a result of several deletions, in some strains of IBV indicates that the ORF is probably a pseudogene.",

The main objective of this study was to determine whether swapping of the structural and accessory genes would restore virulence. To this effect we used rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 to infect one-day-old chicks, and used clinical signs and measurement of the ciliary activity of the epithelial cells lining the trachea of the infected chickens to assess any pathogenicity associated with the virus. No clinical signs, snicking, wheezing and nasal discharge, associated with an IBV infection were observed in the chickens infected with either rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 or Beau-R; the latter as in previous experiments did not show any clinical signs [26]. In contrast, chickens infected with M41-CK did show clinical signs of an IBV infection (Fig. 3); as shown previously [26]. These observations demonstrated that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not pathogenic indicating that replacement of the structural and accessory genes did not restore virulence.",

Growth analysis of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 in TOCs showed that the lack of ciliostasis observed with rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was not due to the inability of the virus to replicate in TOCs (Fig. 5). The rIBV rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was able to replicate in TOCs, though the amount of virus produced was about 1 log10 less than for the growth of Beau-R and M41-CK, somewhat analogous to the growth pattern observed for the virus on CKCs.",

There are known differences between IBV 3\u2032 UTRs, in fact the M41-CK 3\u2032-UTR is 184 nt smaller than the Beau-R 3\u2032-UTR, the remaining part of the M41-CK 3\u2032-UTR representing the conserved region of the IBV 3\u2032-UTR and contains the predicted RNA secondary structures believed to be involved in replication [44]. There are 7 and 3 nucleotide differences between the 5\u2032- and the conserved region of the IBV 3\u2032-UTRs, respectively, of Beau-R and M41-CK ([33], [42], raising the possibility that if the two UTRs interact during replication their heterologous nature could be responsible for the observed decrease in growth for rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 in both CKCs and TOCs. Impairment in growth on TOCs may also have been responsible for the loss of ciliostasis. We hypothesised that an increase in growth would be a selective advantage to the virus and therefore decided to serially passage rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 25 times on CKCs to see whether any adaption could result in a higher growth rate and a virus that could cause ciliostasis in TOCs. For example, due to the very few differences in the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs, between the two parental viruses, a nucleotide substitution in either UTR that may result in a more homogenous interaction, as seen with either parental virus, may result in an increase growth rate. Analysis of the passaged virus, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25, on CKCs and TOCs showed an altered growth rate in comparison to rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3 (Fig. 6). However, rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 still did not cause ciliostasis in TOCs. Sequence analysis of the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 showed that there were no nucleotide substitutions within these regions when compared to rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3, indicating that the change in the growth characteristics was not associated with changes in the UTRs. We therefore sequenced the entire genome of rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 for comparison with the sequence in rVV-BeauR-Rep-M41-Struct, used for generating rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P3, in order to identify any potential changes that may have been responsible for the phenotypic change in growth. We identified three nucleotide changes between the P3 and P25 viruses, one resulted in an amino acid change, Phe\u2192Leu, in the S1 region of the S gene and two adjacent nucleotides in the ORF-5b sequence that had two potential effects, (1) the introduction of a premature stop codon in ORF-5b and (2) modification the N gene TRS. These observations indicate that the increase in growth associated with rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2-P25 could have arisen from the amino acid change in the S protein, the loss of ORF-5b or a potential change in the expression levels of sg mRNA 6, which is responsible for the expression of the N protein. Overall, the main conclusion from our results is the fact that rBeauR-Rep-M41-Struct-2 was non-pathogenic; indicating that the loss of virulence associated with Beaudette is not determined by the structural and the accessory genes of IBV but resides within the replicase gene.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrating that the IBV replicase gene is a determinant of pathogenicity differs from the conclusion by Navas-Martin et al. [45] who reported that the differences in pathogenicity between two strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), MHV-JHM and MHV-A59, mapped to the MHV genome encoding the structural and accessory genes downstream of the haemagglutinin esterase (HE) gene. The replicase gene was interchangeable between the two virus genomes but the differences in pathogenicities associated with two viruses did not appear to correlate with the replicase genes of the rMHVs generated. However, a major difference between the two MHV isolates and the two IBV viruses we used was that the two MHVs were pathogenic but demonstrated different pathogenicities, neurovirulence and hepatitis, respectively, whereas the difference between the two IBV isolates used in this work was that one causes disease and the other does not. It is clear from the MHV work that both replicase sequences are of a \u201cvirulent\u201d phenotype and that the pathogenicity phenotype of the recombinant viruses is associated with the structural and accessory genes. In contrast our results demonstrated that loss of virulence per se can be determined by some attenuating modification to one or more of the coronavirus replicase components. Recent work involving the attenuation of a nephropathogenic strain of IBV by serial passage in embryonated chicken eggs, reported that the virus became fully attenuated by passage P110\n[46]. Sequence analysis of the 3\u2032-7 kb (S gene to poly(A) tail) region of the genome from the P110 virus identified several amino acid substitutions and a 109 nt deletion within the 3\u2032 UTR when compared to P0 virus. The authors reported that the changes identified were potentially responsible for attenuation; they did not report any changes within the replicase gene of the P110 virus and indicated that other changes, apart from those identified in the 3\u2032-7 kb region, within the genome may also be involved in attenuation. Other workers attenuated the virulent Ark DPI 11 strain of IBV following 101 passages in embryonated eggs (Ark DPI 101) and compared the complete genomes of both viruses; identifying 21 nucleotide changes corresponding to 17 amino acid changes [47]. The nucleotide changes resulted in eight amino acid changes in Nsp2 (1), Nsp3 (3), Nsp6 (2), Nsp10 (1) and Nsp13 (1) of the replicase protein, eight amino acid changes in the S protein and one amino acid in ORF 5a and the N protein. The authors were unable to confirm which amino acid changes were responsible for loss of pathogenicity. Taking into consideration our results that loss of virulence associated with the Beaudette strain resides in the replicase and the results of Ammayappan et al.\n[47], it is possible that very few amino acid substitutions within the replicase gene can result in attenuation following serial passage in embryonated eggs.",
