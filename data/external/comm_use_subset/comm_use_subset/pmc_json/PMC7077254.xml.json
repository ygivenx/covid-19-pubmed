            "text": "Canine histiocytic sarcomas are malignant tumors with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options [13,14] which originate from interstitial dendritic cells or from macrophages [15,16,17,18]. Since its establishment in 1988 [19], a canine histiocytic sarcoma cell line (DH82 cells) has been commercially available. DH82 cells can be infected by CDV-Ond [12], and have been reported as a promising model for the investigation of viral oncolysis [8,20,21]. Specifically, acute infection of DH82 cells with CDV-Ond in vitro resulted in a prominent cell death at 12 days post infection [12], followed by establishment of persistent infection in tumor cells surviving the acute lytic phase [11]. In this context, subcutaneous xenotransplantion of persistently CDV-Ond infected DH82 cells resulted in a total regression of neoplasms in a mouse model [11]. This promising observation was assumed to be related to a decreased vascularization of the transplants [11], with the underlying mechanisms not fully understood so far. Therefore, additional investigations using persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells might represent a promising model to study virus-induced alterations of cancer hallmarks [22] and of the tumor microenvironment [23] avoiding the confounding effects correlated with ongoing virus-induced cytopathogenic tumor cell death associated with the acute infection [12]. Indeed, as reviewed by Lapp et al. [8], viral oncolysis mechanisms can be distinguished between primary (i.e., direct virus-induced cytolysis and/or apoptosis) and secondary ones. The latter include a wide range of events leading to tumor cell death, such as modulation of the antiviral and antitumoral immune response, changes in the organization of the tumor-associated extracellular matrix, and alterations of the tumor-associated vasculature and angiogenesis [3,4,7,8,11,23,24,25,26].",

ROS are highly chemically reactive molecules that can induce damage to cellular macromolecules such as nucleic acid and lipids, when they outnumber scavenging systems [28,29,30]. CDV infection can increase ROS production and ROS-induced damage in vitro and in vivo as shown for spontaneous CDV infection in dogs [31,32,33,34,35]. Furthermore, CDV can induce an accumulation of viral glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of Vero cells and primary rat neurons, resulting in increased endoplasmic reticulum stress [36], which has been reported as associated with an increased ROS production [37]. Nevertheless, ROS are physiologically involved in a plethora of different intracellular signaling pathways [29,30], and play a key role in multiple hallmarks of cancer [38].",

This choice was justified by the results of the functional profiling of the same dataset obtained in a previous study, highlighting a down-regulation of the expression of some of the genes correlated with angiogenesis [11]. Therefore, in the current work, a list of human and murine genes and proteins was manually generated according to the literature [29,31,36,37,39,40,41,42,45,46] and translated into canine orthologous gene symbols using the web-based HGNC database (HGNC Database, HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CB10 1SD, United Kingdom, www.genenames.org [47]). After filtration, the raw expression data of the selected genes were compared between non-infected DH82 and DH82Ond pi cells, employing multiple pairwise nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS Enterprise Guide (SAS version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA). Differential expression was defined as the combination of a fold change (FC) filter (FC \u2265 1.5 or \u2264 \u22121.5) and of a statistical significance filter (Mann\u2013Whitney U-test; p \u2264 0.05) [48]. To facilitate the interpretation of results, each gene symbol was assigned to at least one of the following functional groups on the basis of the function(s) carried out by its corresponding protein(s): ROS production; ROS scavenging; ER stress; HIF-1\u03b1 activation, transcriptional activity and regulation; HIF-1\u03b1 angiogenic downstream pathway.",

Briefly, sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated through graded alcohol and pre-treated for antigen retrieval. Following blocking of unspecific bindings, sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min at room temperature. After 60 min of incubation with the secondary antibody, nuclei were stained with Bisbenzimide (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany), and the slides were mounted with Dako Flourescence Mounting Medium (Dako North America, Inc., Carpinteria, CA, USA). Each reaction was carried out with corresponding positive controls (Table 1). For negative controls, the first antibody was replaced with rabbit serum, Balb/c ascitic fluid, or goat serum, respectively at corresponding protein concentrations. To verify the persistent infection status of DH82Ond pi cells (which was set as corresponding to a rate of >95% infected cells), an immunolabeling with an anti-CDV nucleoprotein (CDV-NP) antibody (clone D110; kindly provided by Prof. A. Zurbriggen, University of Bern, Switzerland) was performed. Furthermore, pellets were stained with antibodies directed against 8-hydroxyguanosine/8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHG/8OHdG, in the following paragraphs simply referred to as 8OHdG), a marker of ROS-damaged RNA or DNA [31]; superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase (CAT), two ROS scavengers; HIF-1\u03b1, a transcription factor; wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a cell membrane marker; CD63, directed against tetraspanin-30 expressed on exosome membranes; and GM-130, a marker for Golgi apparatus.

Specifically, neutrophil cytosolic factor 4 (NCF4) and thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), belonging to ROS production and ROS scavenging functional groups, respectively, were the two most markedly up-regulated genes among the entire set examined. Taken together, these findings should be cautiously interpreted as an increased transcription of genes which corresponding proteins are involved in increasing intracellular oxidative stress [29,41,52,53]. Among the group of genes related to ER-stress (partially overlapping with both ROS production and ROS scavenging functional groups), 12 genes were up-regulated while 14 were down-regulated.

Considered that DH82Ond pi cells did not show any difference in growth and apoptotic rate compared to non-infected controls in vitro and during the initial phase after transplantation in vivo [11,20,21], it was assumed that tumor regression of DH82Ond pi xenotransplants was not caused primarily by direct virus-induced cell death alone. Indeed, it seems more likely that secondary effects of the viral infection on the tumor microenvironment [8,23], as similarly reported for Reoviruses [24], account for the complete regression. Specifically, it was estimated that regression of DH82Ond pi xenotransplants might be related to alterations in cancer-associated angiogenesis [11]. Therefore, the aim of the present in vitro study was to investigate in more detail pathways potentially involved in this regression process, taking advantage of the absence of the confounding effects correlated with ongoing tumor cell death associated with acute CDV-Ond infection [12]. Furthermore, to restrict the complex interactions that occur within a living organism, a less complex, highly standardized in vitro model is assumed to facilitate the analysis of specific intracellular pathways. Interestingly, the so-called \u201cangiogenic switch\u201d has been reported to be one of the most important hallmarks of cancer [22,60], thus playing a central role for tumor development and expansion. In this context, the present study focused on pathways correlated with increased levels of intracellular ROS. These highly reactive molecules have been reported both as fundamental intermediates in physiological intracellular signaling transduction [29,30], as well as in the regulation of different cancer hallmarks [38,45,61]. Specifically, together with hypoxia, ROS represent one of the major activators of HIF-1\u03b1 [39,40,42,45,61], a transcription factor involved in the regulation of a wide plethora of cancer features such as invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [22,38,39,40,41,61]. In the context of the aforementioned considerations, the present study was further directed to investigate the impact of a persistent CDV-Ond infection of DH82 cells on cellular oxidative stress.",

            "text": "CDV has been reported as being able to trigger an increase in ROS intracellular levels, with the subsequent induction of oxidative stress in different kinds of cells such as microglia, in vitro as well as in vivo [31,32,33,34,35]. Similarly, the present study revealed increased ROS levels in DH82Ond pi cells, as demonstrated by an increased oxidative burst, as well as suggested by increased gene transcription of TXNIP and NCF4. Specifically, the upregulation of both genes might correlate with an increased intracellular oxidative stress. Indeed, NCF4 encodes for p40phox, a protein that is involved in NADPH oxidase 2 activation [29,41,52]. Additionally, thioredoxin-binding protein 2, encoded by the TXNIP gene, is an important inhibitor of the thioredoxin ROS scavenging system [29,53]. On the other hand, ROS-induced nucleic acid damage did not differ in DH82Ond pi cells compared to non-infected controls. This observation might be interpreted as indicative of an increased oxidative stress associated with the neoplastic nature of DH82 cells rather than an effect of the viral infection. Similarly, increased intracellular ROS levels are described in the literature as a common feature of cancer cells [38,45,61]. In addition, DH82Ond pi cells displayed an increased expression of SOD2 and CAT compared to non-infected controls. The overexpression of these scavenging enzymes involved in ROS detoxification have been correlated with an increased oxidative stress in neoplastic [38,45,61] as well as in inflammatory conditions [62].",

The data in the present study might be interpreted as suggestive of an acquired ability of DH82 cells to adapt to the persistent infection with CDV-Ond. However, a marked protein overexpression of ER-stress markers such as calnexin, calreticulin and CHOP/GADD 153 have been observed in Vero cell and primary rat neurons 36 h post-infection with recombinant A75/17-V CDV [31]. On the other hand, the aforementioned lack of differences in growth and apoptotic rate between non infected and DH82Ond pi cells [20,21] is in line with the hypothesis that a persistent infection with CDV-Ond might be associated with the activation of adaptive and pro-survival pathways to contrast prolonged oxidative stress, as reported in recombinant HeLa cells expressing silkworm storage protein 1 [54]. The hypothesis of the present study is further supported by the finding of an increased expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes in DH82Ond pi cells at both a molecular and protein level, highlighting the plasticity of cancer cells in actively contrasting excessively severe alterations in their redox potential [45,61].",

Hypoxia has been widely reported as the most powerful inductor of HIF-1\u03b1 transcriptional activity [39,40,42]; however, in the present study, cells were cultivated under normoxic conditions. Therefore, hypoxia could be excluded as the cause of the increased HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression observed in our in vitro model. Consequently, it seems more plausible that the increased expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in DH82Ond pi cells was induced by the increased oxidative stress level compared to non-infected controls. The down-regulation of 2 PHDs as well as of VHL on a molecular level, in association with a lacking regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 opposed to an increased expression of the corresponding protein, could imply that the increased protein expression of HIF-1 \u03b1 in DH82Ond pi cells does not refer to an increased synthesis, but rather to an inhibition of the degradation pathway.",

Further investigations aiming to better characterize the aforementioned vesicles, revealed a co-localization of HIF-1\u03b1 expression with CD63, a marker for the tetraspanin-30 expressed by exosomal membranes [63]. Interestingly, the presence of HIF-1\u03b1 within CD63+ exosomes has previously been reported in Epstein-Barr virus-infected NP69 cells [58]. On the other hand, HIF-1\u03b1 only occasionally co-localized with CD63+ exosomes, while it frequently overlapped with the localization of CDV-NP. The measles virus N-protein, which is closely related to CDV-NP [64], is transported within the cell through the endolysosomal system [59], also rendering this a possible mechanism for the canine counterpart. Furthermore, this observation displays an interesting basis for future investigations on the exact sub-cellular localization of HIF-1\u03b1 within DH82Ond pi cells.",

Though VEGF-B is nowadays recognized as not being directly involved in angiogenesis, this growth factor has been reported as an indirect enhancer of VEGF-A (a well-known inducer of angiogenesis), as well as a key promoter of survival of different cell types (including endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells) in several pathological conditions [65,66,67]. As already reported in the literature [20], the markedly reduced expression of VEGF-B in DH82Ond pi cells did not affect cellular growth nor the apoptotic rate [21]. Interestingly, DH82Ond pi cell xenotransplants displayed a significantly reduced microvessel density compared to non-infected controls [11]. According to the results of the present study, it can be assumed that HIF-1\u03b1 might represent an important mediator of the oncolytic effects described for the in vivo model of DH82Ond pi xenotransplants as reported previously in another viral oncolysis model [68].",

Future studies are warranted to better characterize the localization of HIF-1\u03b1 and the exosomes in which it is contained, as well as to verify the presence of an increased oxidative stress and an aberrant HIF-1\u03b1 localization in DH82Ond pi also in vivo.

(B) A double labeling directed against HIF-1\u03b1 (Cy3, red) and the CDV nucleoprotein (CDV-NP; Cy2, green) revealed a frequent co-localization (yellow) beneath the cell membrane and within the perinuclear area (insert) of persistently CDV-infected DH82 cells. Nuclei were stained with bisbenzimide (blue). Bar = 20 \u00b5m.",
