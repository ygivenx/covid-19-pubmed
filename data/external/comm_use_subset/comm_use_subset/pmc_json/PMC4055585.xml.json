            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is chronic and difficult to cure, clinical treatment, continues to be a major public health problem. In China, the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier rate accounts for 9.8 percent of the population, and one third of the worldwide carrier [1]. HBV is the prototype of hepadnaviridae, a family of small, enveloped hepatotropic DNA viruses that can infect the liver of humans [2]. Infection by the virus results in a series of clinical symptoms ranging from minor flu-like symptoms to acute, fulminant or chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver carcinoma, and can even result in death [3]. HBV is estimated to be responsible for 500,000\u2013700,000 deaths each year [4]. There are a number of drugs available to treat hepatitis B viral infection, including interferon (IFN), Thymosin \u03b1 (T\u03b1), famciclovir (FCV), adefovir (ADV), lamivudine (LAM) et al. However, none of these therapies are completely safe and effective, and clinical exploration of promising antiviral agents like nucleoside analogues is hampered by their significant side effects, especially the development of resistant viruses [5]\u2013[7]. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the safer, more efficacious and less expensive anti-HBV agents.",

These complexes are versatile and can be used in catalytic processes [8], magnetic materials[9], nanotechnology [10] and medical procedures. Several POMs are especially useful in medicinal chemistry, serving as new kinds of inorganic medicinal candidates that possess antiviral, antitumor, and antibiotic activities [11]\u2013[14]. Because of their extremely small (sub 5 nm) dimensions, they exhibit low toxicity, are stable in biological media, are liable to be cleared by the renal system, and can be engineered for various applications, especially as antiviral agents [15]. POMs have been widely researched in recent years, and they have been proven to be active against a wide range of viruses, including both RNA viruses and DNA viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency RNA virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome RNA virus (SARS), influenza RNA virus and herpes simplex DNA virus (HSV) [16]\u2013[19]. The mechanism of antiviral action may occur through the prevention of viral adsorption and penetration by inhibiting the activity of retroviridase [20]\u2013[22]. The advantage of POMs in antiviral activity inspired us to find effective anti-HBV drug candidates in this field.",

The most detailed published investigation of POM pharmacokinetics is that of Ni et al, and the atomic emission spectrometry methods for determination the concentration of POM in rats have already been described by this group. Since the limitations of the method, such as insensitive and less selective of detection limit, the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods with more sensitively and selectively were first applied to determine the concentration of W in plasma, urine, feces, bile and organ samples. Findings from this study would be useful to evaluate the potential medicinal application of Compound 1, and to perfect and complete the pharmacokinetics of POMs.",

The highest deposition at 0.25 h was found in the stomach and intestine, but these concentrations decreased as time passed, which indicates that the main route of absorption is through the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to the gastrointestinal tract, Compound 1 also deposits in the liver, kidney, lungs and spleen, which have more blood flow. In contrast, Compound 1 deposits less in fat and skeletal muscle, which have little blood. The low concentration of Compound 1 in the testis, epididymis, ovary and uterus is consistent with the results in reproductive toxicity experiments, which found no obvious reproductive toxicity of Compound 1[28]. Much lower contents in the heart suggest that the cardiovascular system is not prone to being impaired by Compound 1. Less deposition was found in the brain, suggesting that Compound 1 cannot go through the blood brain barrier easily. The content of Compound 1 in the kidney and liver was as high as 10\u201370 times the content in the other tissues, which implied that kidney and liver were the main metabolism and elimination positions, and that they may the possible toxic sites. The high content in liver is also in favor of the treatment of chronic hepatitis. The clearance from tissues is rather quick; the content in tissues is less than 10% of the peak content at 96 h.",
