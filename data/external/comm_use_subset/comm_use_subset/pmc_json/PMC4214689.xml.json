WHO has estimated that there are more than 150 million people with chronic liver disease which were caused by HCV infection in 2012, and over 350,000 people has been dead from HCV-related diseases worldwide each year [3]. Due to lack of vaccine and unavailability of effective therapy, the prevention of HCV infection has been a great challenge, especially in China, which is the largest developing country and owns one-fifths of the world's population. The population of China had approached 1.35 billion at the end of 2011 [4]. Although the prevalence of HCV infection had been lower in China after mid-1990s and the overall prevalence of anti-HCV was less than 1% in recent years [5], [6], the huge size of China population makes the absolute number of people infected with HCV enormous.",

Although various studies have already shown the prevalence of HCV infection varies with the different geographic positions in China [1], [4], [7], most of existing studies mainly focused on the spatial distribution of HCV genotypes and limited researches on the spatial distribution of HCV infection itself [8]\u2013[10]. Shunquan Wu et al used spatial technique to work on the prevalence of HCV infection in Fujian province, and found that the HCV infection did have a relationship with spatial factors and the cluster of disease [11]. Apart from this study, the HCV infections in some provinces were more serious than other surrounding provinces, which might attribute to poor economy, inadequate primary health infrastructure, or inappropriate treatments [1]. In addition, HCV infection shares the same transmission routes with HIV infection, which had been already observed cluster of disease in studies [12], [13]. Especially for the intravenous drug users (IDUs), the prevalence of co-infection of HIV and HCV are high [14], and the HIV epidemics have association with geographic factors [15].",

Since then, all medical institutions should report diagnosed HCV infection cases to specific local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through CISDCP. Demographic information (age, gender, address, registered residency places, time of onset of the disease etc.) were collected using standardized case report forms (CRFs) by conducting private interviews. After being checked, confirmed case reports were saved in the web-based system. The procedure of reporting HCV case through CISDCP is consistent around the whole country. This comprehensive and well-organized system, CISDCP, can provide both the number of HCV infection cases and the spatial distribution information of these cases across the country.",
