            "text": "The canonical Wnt signaling pathway promotes bone formation not only by stimulating the differentiation of osteoblasts, increasing the growth rate of osteoblasts and reducing their apoptosis but also by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis [7]. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is triggered by the association of secretory Wnt with its frizzled (Fz) receptors and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) on the cell surface. This stabilizes \u03b2-catenin, which is eventually translocated into the nucleus, and activates the TCF/LEF-mediated transcription of target genes that elicit a variety of effects, including the induction of osteoblast differentiation and proliferation [8]. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a soluble and natural inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, may play an active role in inhibiting osteogenesis by binding the ligands of Wnt proteins [9, 10]. In addition to LPR5/6, DKK1 was also found to bind to Kremen, another cell surface coreceptor, forming a ternary complex that is rapidly endocytosed, resulting in the depletion of cell surface LRP5/6 [11]. Studies have demonstrated that the levels of DKK1 in serum were significantly higher in RA patients and were correlated with the severity of the disease [12]. In a mouse model of RA, treatment with an anti-DKK1 antibody has attenuated bone erosion [9]. Therefore, DKK1 may be a promising therapeutic target for RA bone loss.",

DNA vaccines have many advantages over conventional chemical agents, biological agents, and protein vaccines in the treatment of diseases. First, plasmid preparation is rapid and cost effective and does not suffer from problems such as improper protein folding. Plasmid DNA is highly stable and flexible, allowing for the modification of plasmid sequences [14]. In addition, the antigen presenting cells (APCs) process and present the epitopes from antigens on MHC I and II molecules, thereby inducing both humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Active immunotherapy is feasible to reverse the disorders of autoimmune diseases. DNA vaccines have proven effective in animal models, including RA, Crohn's disease, systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE), and infectious diseases [15] and have been extensively evaluated in humans. The advancements of bioinformation software and molecular immunology promoted the development of DNA vaccine [16]. Currently, 72 Phase I, 20 Phase II, and 2 Phase III clinical trials have been identified [17].",

To reduce their potential bone resorption of natural DKK1, the synthesis epitopes were injected to BALB/c and no significant osteoclastogenesis was observed. These data demonstrated that these separated epitopes were safe as a vaccine utilized in vivo. To increase the immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine as expressed in the host, the key binding sites of DKK1 (R203, H204, K211, and R236) to LRP5/6 and Kremen were mutated. At the same time, the mutated protein expressed in vivo enhanced the immunogenicity of the vaccine [20]. To facilitate the epitope processing, the four selected epitopes were separated from one another with AAY spacers [25]. AAYs expressed inside the selected epitopes were easily recognized by proteasomes, and the full-length protein was more easily processed and presented in vivo. DKK1 is expressed naturally in the body. To further increase the immunogenicity of the recombinant DNA vaccine, the pan DR T helper epitope (PADRE) was added to enhance antibody responses [26]. Finally, the signal peptide for human DKK1 was added at the N-terminus of the DNA vaccine to facilitate the extracellular secretion of the protein antigen.",

            "text": "The DNA vaccine delivery method is one of the most important factors that affect immunization efficiency. The methods for DNA vaccine delivery currently used include intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous injection, and others. The delivery method for the plasmid directly affects the uptake of the gene and further affects the expression of the target protein. Intramuscular injection is the earliest and simplest method for DNA delivery. However, the majority of the administered plasmid DNA was blocked by perimysia of the skeletal muscles, where most of the DNA was degraded by DNase I in the plasma. Less than 1% of the DNA actually entered the nucleus [27]. Recently, electroporation has been used for DNA vaccine delivery and has proven to be a better DNA delivery method. In this study, intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA followed by electroporation (DNA + EP) was employed. The DC electric current disrupts cell membranes for a short time, allowing the plasmid DNA to cross the membranes into the nucleus [28]. In addition, the electric current causes cell destruction and a local inflammatory reaction. A large number of inflammatory cells, including macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells, infiltrated the injected muscles, which enhanced the efficiency of antigen presentation. In our study, the highly specific IgG antibodies in serum were induced as early as 4 weeks, which also demonstrated the efficiency of the electroporation of the DNA vaccine.",

Inhibition of its biological functions can attenuate bone destruction in RA [9]. Our results showed that the recombinant human DKK1 multiepitope DNA vaccine induced specific antibodies that effectively neutralized the biological activities of DKK1 and attenuated bone destruction in CIA mice. This study may provide a potential therapy for RA and other bone loss diseases.",
