About 6.8% of adults develop PTSD in their lifetimes; 3.5% have the condition in any given year [5, 6]. Approximately 10%\u201350% of the survivors of traumatic events such as earthquakes and tsunamis will develop chronic PTSD [7], which often persists for years if untreated [8\u201310]. The disorder is characterized by flashbacks and avoidance or numbness as well as hyperarousal after experiencing, witnessing, or confronting actual or potential death, serious physical injury, or a threat to physical integrity [11]. In addition to these symptoms, co-morbid psychiatric disorders are extremely common. In the National Comorbidity Survey (USA), approximately 80% of individuals with PTSD also met criteria for at least one other disorder listed in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-III (DSM-III) [4]. Patients with PTSD often manifest other complications such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, hostility, and paranoid ideation disorders [3, 12\u201316]. Co-morbid psychiatric disorders and related subclinical symptoms combined with core PTSD symptoms result in poor general psychological status (GPS). ",

Xiao-Yao-San is one of the most popular [30\u201336]. We developed a modified, granulated form of Xiao-Yao-San, Xiao-Tan-Jie-Yu-Fang (XTJYF), by adding additional herbs, mainly from another classic TCM formula Er-Chen-Tang for treating depression, and we studied the safety and effects of this modification in cancer patients with depression (see Table 1) [39]. Because we found the formula effective and observed no serious side effects, we hypothesized that XTJYF would improve GPS in PTSD patients. ",

In the enrollment survey, the relationship between exposure to the earthquake and PTSD was assessed. Preliminary screening was performed in the communities by our researchers according to the DSM III for PTSD, Chinese version [40]. Eligible subjects were invited to participate in a diagnostic face-to-face or telephone interview with one of three experienced psychiatrists, each of which has at least eight years of clinical experience. Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled (see Patient Flow Chart, Figure 1), and our psychologists verified PTSD as the primary diagnosis of each enrollee. Inclusion criteria were age 16 or older, meeting DSM III criteria for PTSD with at least one of the nine Symptom Check-List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) [41] subscores above the Chinese norm [42], and being willing to be randomly assigned. Participants understood that those randomized into the placebo control group could receive XTJYF after completion of the whole trial if they wished. Exclusion criteria were past history of bipolarism, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders; current organic mental disorder, factitious disorder, or malingering; any past history of alcohol or substance dependence or abuse; evidence of clinically significant hepatic or renal disease or any other acute or unstable medical condition that might interfere with safe participation in the study; use of any medication with clinically significant psychotropic activity within two weeks of randomization; any cognitive-behavioral therapy during the trial; psychotherapy initiated or ending during the trial. For female patients of childbearing age, participation was contingent on a negative serum pregnancy test and a medically accepted method of contraception.",

Three supplementary global indices reflect the degree of symptomatology. The global severity index (GSI) registers the average depth of impairment based on the severity recorded for each symptom; the positive symptom total index (PST) indicates the total number of symptoms experienced; the Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI) reflects the level of distress by correlating the reported symptoms [41]. In addition, on the SCL-90-R, there are seven items not included in any of the nine factors, among which, three reflect sleep quality. Individual SCL-90-R factors have been used to evaluate the psychological condition of PTSD patients, and there is sufficient evidence to support the correlation of higher global SCL-90-R scores with the severity of a patient's core PTSD symptoms [12, 48\u201357].",

Although a few subjects reported gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea and diarrhea during treatment, these were probably due to the poor diet available after the earthquake; these symptoms were also frequently reported in the placebo control group.

For example, PTSD patients who report somatic symptoms also report higher overall PTSD symptoms [15, 64] and a higher frequency of depression [64, 74]. Patients with co-morbid PTSD and obsessive-compulsive behavior have been found to have a poorer response to cognitive behavioral therapy than those diagnosed with PTSD alone [73]. Co-morbid PTSD/depression appears to predict greater refractoriness to pharmacotherapy, greater symptom severity, lower levels of functioning and rates of recovery, and increased disability and potential of suicide [4, 6, 65\u201367]. Like depression, anxiety symptoms are associated with lower quality-of-life estimates and greater refractoriness to routine pharmacotherapy in PTSD patients [3, 68]. Hostility, which according to a meta-analysis of 39 studies is significantly elevated in individuals with PTSD [16], is linked to adverse health outcomes, including cardiac death [69]. In the present study, XTJYF also appears to improve the sleep quality of these PTSD patients; sleep disturbances are among the most treatment-resistant symptoms of PTSD [75]. All of these symptoms are likely to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse [76, 77] as well as suicidal ideation [78]. ",

            "text": "The psychological mechanisms of action of Xiao-Yao-San and its modifications have been investigated. It has been reported that the formula may act on psychological symptoms by upregulating central neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Bao et al. [79] reported that Xiao-Yao-San produced antidepressant effects in a mouse model of depression by ameliorating brain cortex 5-HT and 5-HIAA content. Other mechanisms of the formula have also been reported. Yue et al. [80] reported that Xiao-Yao-San suppressed chronic stress in a rat model by up-regulating GluR2/3, the AMPA receptor subunit 2/3, which mediates the postsynaptic depolarization that initiates neuronal firing [81], and by downregulating PICK1, a protein that interacts with C-kinase 1, which may lead to AMPA receptor anchorage [82] in hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3. Similar findings, that Xiao-Yao-San upregulates AMPA receptor subunit mRNA expression in hippocampal region CA1 and the amygdala, were reported [83]. Furthermore, Xiao-Yao-San and its modifications were reported to suppress chronic stress by maintaining the stability of hippocampal neurons [84], inhibiting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis negative feedback regulation [85], and counteracting increase of Ca2+ concentration in hippocampal synaptosomes [86]. Based on TCM theory, seven drugs were added in our modification, mainly from another classic TCM formula, Er-Chen-Tang. According to our previous preclinical study, this modification may suppress depression by up-regulating the 5-HT1A receptor in the hippocampus in a rat model of chronic stress [87]. However, because Xiao-Yao-San and its modifications contain multiple ingredients, specific active ingredients have not been identified, and the herbal interactions within the formula have not been systematically investigated. Further investigation to elucidate the mechanisms of action of this formula is warranted.",

This was largely due to the difficulties in following up this particular population, which consisted of earthquake survivors living in shelters with no specific address. In the patient recruitment stage, more than 45% (372 of 820) of those preliminarily screened for PTSD were lost to follow-up. Secondly, we did not include a questionnaire measuring specific PTSD core symptoms, mainly because of the low level of education in this mountain population. In our patient population, 43% had an elementary education or less and found it difficult to complete a single 90-question SCL-90-R questionnaire. However, although we did not include a specific questionnaire such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale [88] or the Clinician-Rated Treatment Outcome PTSD Scale [89] to measure core PTSD symptoms, the widely used SCL-90-R captures a broader patient psychological profile than a specific PTSD questionnaire would do. Thirdly, only one dosage of XTJYF was used in this study, that used in our standard clinical practice. A higher dosage might benefit the nonresponders. Finally, more detailed information on types of trauma and the percentages of patients who suffered them should be gathered and analyzed.",
