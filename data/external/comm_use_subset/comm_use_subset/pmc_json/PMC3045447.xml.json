Unfortunately, due to the limitation of resolution and contrast, at the early stage of the disease, minor pathological changes can not be discerned by conventional absorption-based imaging techniques. For example, lung cancer is one of the most common diseases with low survival rates worldwide; early detection of the lung cancer is known to improve the chances of successful treatment. But in most cases, cancer has been detected in the terminal stage and is impossible to be cured [1], [5], [7]. As a result, it is of great importance to image micro-structures in lung to enable early detection.",

            "text": "Phase contrast imaging (PCI) is a relatively new imaging technique, which can provide high contrast images by using phase shift of the X-ray. It is well known that X-ray is a form of electromagnetic wave. When it propagates through an object, both the amplitude and the phase of the wave are modified. It can be described by a complex reflective index [11], given by n = 1\u2212\u03b4\u2212i\u03b2. The imaginary part \u03b2 is related to the attenuation based on absorption of the object, which we use in the conventional X-ray imaging. Unfortunately, the variations in X-ray absorption between different biological soft tissues are quite small; this technique may lead to very low contrast and poor spatial resolution. The real part \u03b4 is responsible for the X-ray phase shift. For biological soft tissues, the phase shift is almost one thousand times greater than the absorption term. Therefore, the aim of phase contrast imaging is to use the information of X-ray phase shift and convert it into image contrast [12]. This technique can greatly improve the image quality of soft tissues, particularly at the interface of tissues where the refractive index changes significantly. During recent years, it has been widely used by researchers for imaging of small animals. Among all the main PCI methods, in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging (IL-XPCI) is the simplest and the most straightforward, making it more suitable for clinical applications than other methods [13]. IL-XPCI has previously been used to study soft tissues of both human and small animals such as mice, rats, and rabbits. The results are satisfactory: high resolution images were obtained [14]\u2013[16]. It may be an alternative method for lung observation and it is totally non-invasive.",

Due to the significant difference in density between air and tissues, the inner edges of the airway can result in marked edge enhancement in the phase contrast images. This has previously been proven by Suzuki et al [16]. Nevertheless, for the large number of alveoli, the fine structures were averaged out. Other researchers like Parsons and Sera et al. have utilized IL-XPCI to study lungs, and successfully generated the three-dimensional models of mouse airways [7], [17]. Despite advances in lung imaging using IL-XPCI, three-dimensional visualization of the alveoli in the intact animals has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the alveoli are important tiny structures through which gas exchange occurs. The morphology and distribution of alveoli can reveal information regarding lung health. For the diagnosis of drowning or other types of respiratory disorder like pneumonia, asthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema, the shape of alveoli can be of considerable value [3], [18]. Furthermore, the morphology and growth of alveoli in embryos can reveal the secret of lung development, which has long fascinated biologists and mathematicians [19]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore these small alveoli.",

Compared to conventional X-ray CT, in-line X-ray phase contrast CT had a much higher resolution (about 13 \u00b5m in our experiment). Bone, bronchi and alveoli were easily discernible with clear edges, which made it possible to separate different anatomical structures using the image segmentation technique. In order to extract the lung tissue and remove background noise, we applied a threshold-based image segmentation method to the CT slices. A comparison between original CT slice and threshold-based segmentation result is presented in Figure 2. The threshold was chosen at the valley of the histogram (Figure 2B). Other pixels with intensity lower than the threshold were set to zero. After gray scale transformation, the resulted image was shown in Figure 2D. From the profiles at the white line drawn in the same place of the two CT slices, the background noise in the image was considerably reduced.",

The three-dimensional images of the alveoli were shown in Figure 5A. The maximum diameter and the minimum diameter were measured in Figure 5B. The ratio of maximum and minimum diameters reflects the morphology of the alveoli to some extent. If this ratio approximates one, the shape of the alveolus is closer to a spheroid. The alveoli provide an enormous surface area for respiratory exchange; the change of alveolar surface area is closely related to lung health. For this reason, we calculated the surface area of each alveolus, as shown in Figure 5C.",

            "text": "The lungs are composed of sponge-like soft tissues. Detection of soft tissues using conventional absorption-based radiography is limited by the variation in tissue density. Since PCI is a phase-sensitive technique, it facilitates the visualization of fine structures, particularly in soft tissues. This technique has opened a new window for the visualization of lung. As a current imaging modality, clinical thin-section CT can be used to visualize airways with an internal diameter larger than 2 mm. It is better than conventional radiography and can provide more detailed information [6]. However, the terminal airspaces cannot be detected via this technique. Micro-CT for laboratory studies has a much higher resolution on the order of microns. Nevertheless, it is still based on the absorption information of the X-ray. The alveolar wall and the air space can not provide sufficient contrast to be observed [20]. A few studies have applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the lung imaging. Although MRI can provide excellent soft tissue imaging and functional imaging, the limitations lie in the low spatial resolution and long acquisition times [21]. The measurement of bronchial diameter will be hampered by these limitations, because normal spatial resolution of MRI is in the range of 4\u20136 mm and only a few can reach up to 1 mm [22]. The lung is an air-filled organ. At the air-tissue boundary, the refractive index changes significantly, so the lung becomes highly visible in PCI images. The lung images in our experiment have shown dramatic improvement in quality, and the alveoli can be clearly discerned. The theoretical spatial resolution of our experimental system is about 1 \u00b5m, while the diameter of mature mouse alveoli range from 38 to 80 \u00b5m and human alveoli are larger at 200\u2013250 \u00b5m [15]. Thus, the resolution of PCI is adequate for micro-structures observation in lung. Though the radiation dose in our experiment was relatively larger than that used in clinical imaging, it can be reduced by the use of high energy X-ray, since contrast is not dependent on absorption of the beam [12], [15]. In addition, compared to other existing PCI methods, IL-XPCI requires relatively simple instrument. Most importantly, conventional laboratory X-ray source can be used as the light source, although longer exposure times are required [13]. The equipments are similar to conventional radiography. In this regard, it has the potential to be used in clinical diagnosis.",

But it is invasive and can not be repeated [10], [23]. During the process of invasive sampling, anesthesia is often required and tissue deformation frequently happen which is a major disadvantage when studying the morphology of the organs. There has long been a desire to explain breathing mechanism at the alveolar level. Unfortunately, a full understanding of these fine structures' original morphology is not available, because the lung will collapse when opening the thoracic cage at autopsy, due to the loss of negative pleural pressure [18]. Some researchers used confocal microscope to evaluate alveolar dynamics in the mouse lungs. However, this technique is limited by the depth of imaging (about 50 \u00b5m) [24]. How lungs develop has long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. Nevertheless, this process cannot be visualized in living embryos with current techniques [19]. Therefore, we adopted IL-XPCI to observe the lung non-invasively. An intact mouse was used to the maximum extent to preserve the organ's original morphology. In addition, previous studies have shown that deceased lungs can maintain a sufficient aeration level to be visualized [15].",

The 3D volume data allowed virtual endoscope of the lung airways which helped the doctor visualize the 3D model of lung and perform a diagnosis without having to operate on the patient. Moreover, the measurement of alveoli showed the ability of PCI to observe the morphology of lung.

Despite the advances in spatial resolution and contrast of phase contrast imaging, real-time X-ray phase tomography of the live animals has remained difficult. Live animals can only be imaged in two dimensions. The major obstacle in realizing this is the motion artifacts caused by breathing and cardiac motion of the animals, which will lead to serious blur in the reconstructed CT images. It is well known that the alveoli in lung are very small; any noise can influence the accuracy of the imaging result. Some attempts have been made to live animals imaging by taking the projection images at a specific breathing phase in synchrony with ECG signals [26]. But the animals have to be anaesthetized and with their breathing controlled by a ventilator. High-speed X-ray phase tomography may be another possible solution to live animal imaging by substantially reducing the imaging time. In fact, finishing a CT in one respiration phase is possible but the rotation speed of the sample stage and the time resolution of the detector need to be improved [27]. Another limitation was the lack of pathological samples. In this study, a normal 1-day-old mouse was used. The results proved that IL-XPCI is possible for lung micro-structures observation. Lung disorder models were missing, such as asthma, emphysema and lung cancer. We plan to evaluate these disorder models in our IL-XPCI imaging experiment as next steps, which are in progress now.",

Pogany, Gao and Wilkins first established the theoretical formalism for phase contrast image formation of weakly absorbing thin objects [28]. When X-ray beams travel through the object, the downstream beams carry the information of absorption and phase shift. The interaction between the object and the beam can be described by this transmission function(1)where (x, y) is the spatial coordinates in the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction z, \u03bc and \u03d5 are the attenuation and phase shift induced by the object. They are given by(2)\n(3)where \u03bb is the wavelength of the X-ray, \u03b2 and \u03b4 are the imaginary and real parts of the refractive index, respectively. After propagating a sufficient distance, the phase shifts in the downstream beams are transformed into measurable intensity variations by means of Fresnel diffraction. An image detector records them as the phase contrast image. According to Fresnel diffraction theory and the wave front function, the Fourier transform of the recorded intensity can be approximated by(4)where \u03b4(u, v) is unit impulse function, (u, v) is the coordinate in Fourier domain, M and \u03a6 are the Fourier transform of \u03bc and \u03d5 respectively at the distance z. From Eq. (4) one can find that the recorded intensity of the image is determined by the phase shift and the absorption of the wave.

It consisted of two monochromator crystals, one automatic rotation sample stage and one X-ray sensitive CCD detector. The incident white synchrotron X-ray beam was first monochromatized by two Si (111) prefect crystals. The tunable energy range was from 8 to 72.5 keV, with the energy resolution of about 0.5%.

Then an image segmentation method was applied to separate the lung tissues from the background. Since the histograms of our lung images had two peaks and a valley between them, the threshold for image segmentation can be chosen automatically at the bottom of this valley [30]. The other pixels with intensity lower than the threshold were set to zero. After this step, the ribs associated with many background signals considered as noise were removed. The whole lung airways can be segmented from this volume dataset by manually set a gray-level threshold. Due to the complexity of the lung structures and their irregular shapes and similar gray levels on the images, threshold-based image segmentation method was inadequate to separate the bronchial tree from the whole lung airways. In this study, we developed an image segmentation method based on 3D region growing to separate bronchial tree which was a semi-automatic procedure. It started in manually placing the seed point in the section of bronchus as well as setting the intensity threshold. Under the control of the intensity threshold, the growing would stop when the bronchial tree were separated.",
