It\u2019s the world\u2019s second largest health research funder after the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with an endowment of \u00a319 billion (US$ 29.5 billion). How did it feel to take over the reins as director of the Wellcome Trust in October 2013?",

The first outweighs the second, and you grasp the amazing opportunity and seek to contribute what you can. It is an enormous privilege and honour to be the director of such an organization. Having been funded by the Wellcome Trust as a researcher for almost two decades, I knew it very well from the outside. I knew its approach to research, its history and ethos and its values and many of the people working there. This was incredibly helpful when I took over as director.",

There are stellar individual researchers out there and I strongly believe in funding the best people, but I also believe in funding the best people working in great teams in great environments. I also believe in funding young people. Writing a book is an individual pursuit and there are areas of science where a brilliant individual working alone makes a breakthrough. But the world of research is increasingly about people working in multidisciplinary teams that consider the social context of their work and are not working in a scientific vacuum. While I believe we must continue to support individual researchers to explore their dreams, there is also a need to put back into the heart of research funding the opportunity for groups of researchers to work together and integrate the broader social consequences of their work. That is why we recently introduced collaborative grants to encourage teams of researchers to work together within or between disciplines.",

I felt we need to back young people taking on what might seem improbable ideas and encourage them. There has been a tendency, and not just at the Wellcome Trust, to move away from funding young people and award very large grants to people with long established track records. We should support well-established scientists, but we risk disenfranchising young people. We need to support the development of the next generation of research leaders.",

Under my predecessor Mark Walport, the Trust\u2019s spending on grants outside the United Kingdom increased from approximately 11\u201312% to 23\u201325% and I hope we can increase this even further. This is important to the Trust\u2019s history and goes back to our founder, Henry Wellcome, who was an internationalist. We are a global funder of research with a focus on support for research that can make a difference to people\u2019s lives. The United Kingdom has a very strong basic science, clinical and humanities research base, but the Trust is committed to global health and is a global organization.",

For example, we have set up a research hub with the Indian government, the Wellcome DBT India Alliance, which peer-reviews applications from Indian researchers, interviews candidates and decides which applicants should receive funding. This way research is defined at local level and not from an office in London. We have also recently created a research hub in Africa called the Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa. This is a partnership with the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and we hope others in future. The African programme is now transitioning from London to the African Academy of Sciences in Nairobi, where the peer-review process and interviews for grants will be led by the African Academy of Sciences. These two major initiatives support the development of the next generation of research leaders based in Africa and India. I hope to work towards further initiatives in the future in eastern Asia and other parts of the world.",

The whole of modern medicine relies on having effective antibiotics to prevent and treat infections. Without antibiotics basic surgery, chemotherapy for cancer and care of patients with diabetes, for example, become very difficult if not impossible.

We need to be much better prepared to identify and report such infections when they emerge as well as other potential public health threats. We also need to be able to respond to these threats in a much more decisive and coordinated manner. Such a response requires much stronger public health and clinical systems in all countries but in particular low- and middle-income countries. It also requires honest, transparent and accountable reporting and sharing of data, equitable sharing of the benefits of that data (including affordable and real-time access for diagnostics, drugs, vaccines or social interventions) and much greater incentives for countries to work together and share information.",
