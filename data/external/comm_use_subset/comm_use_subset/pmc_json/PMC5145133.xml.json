Such analysis methods have for instance been applied to local outbreaks of SARS [1], Chikungunya [2] and MERS CoV [3]. However, when an outbreak is distributed over a larger area, the spatial aggregation of epidemic data can result in time series that are too coarse to adequately capture the disease dynamics [4]. Ideally, the analysis should allow for the higher spatial resolution of the data [5]. The recent Ebola epidemic provides such a case in which extended spatiotemporal data were collected.",

Earlier epidemics in the east and middle of the African continent were usually confined to a limited area and brought under control within a few months [7]. Similarly, the West African epidemic began in a rural area around Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea at the end of 2013, but started to deviate from the typical pattern when cases were observed first in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou City and later in the large urban area of capital Conakry. Around the same time the infection spread from the border area around Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou into Liberia, followed by Sierra Leone two months later. Their capitals Monrovia and Freetown were infected shortly after these incursions, allowing the virus to spread in highly urbanised populations with limited health care facilities. In July 2014, the WHO recognised the Ebola epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. While aid programs were being extended and implemented, the epidemic reached its peak in the autumn of 2014, when hundreds of cases were reported weekly. Subsequently, incidence rates started to decline, bringing the epidemic gradually under control. All countries were declared free of Ebola at some point in 2015, but transmission seems to be ongoing at a low level as evidenced by the sporadic observation of new cases.",

For instance, in Liberia and Sierra Leone, all districts were affected, while in Guinea, six districts seemed to have escaped infection. Also, Conakry did not experience an exponentially growing outbreak like Freetown and Monrovia did, despite their comparable population size and density. These differences between and within countries are evident from the district-level incidence data that the WHO published weekly from November 2014 onwards. Using the full resolution of the data could potentially reveal useful insights into the epidemic spread within and between districts. Such an analysis should take into account that an observed case in one district could have been infected in another. For instance, Yang et al. [16] analysed the epidemic in the 14 districts of Sierra Leone using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, but because they ignored the possible role of Guinea and Liberia, independent introductions from other sources needed to be allowed.",

We build on a method for estimating time-varying reproduction numbers [17, 18] that tracks the effective reproduction number over time. For a single infected population, the model is fully specified by the incidence data and the serial interval distribution, i.e. the time between observations of paired cases. To allow for multiple populations, this model needs to be extended. We assume that a fraction of newly infected persons leave their district and will be observed in another district. This dispersal follows a gravity-type power law [19]: infectees scatter over districts depending on the distance to and the population size of the destination. In this way, the full epidemic can be treated as an interconnected network of local epidemics that are separated in space and time. Analysis of the epidemic with this method not only provides estimates for the local effective reproduction numbers over time, but also determines the contribution of each location to the epidemic. It should be noted though that this is a descriptive rather than a predictive method.",

Incidence data on district level are augmented to include suspected cases for which only data on country level are available (Fig 1 and Methods). In the analysis, we distinguish between countries to be able to account for possible differences between within-country and cross-border transmissions. The effective reproduction numbers and the distribution between local and imported cases are studied for each district, as well as the contribution of different districts to new introductions.

Although the fractions of generated cases that were exported are found to be comparable for each country, the fractions of observed cases that were imported can differ from district to district. This mainly depends on the incidences in surrounding districts. For instance, the many imported cases in Kambia, Sierra Leone, are the spill-over of the local epidemic in nearby Port Loko. In general, most of the imported cases come from a district in the same country (Fig 3). Of the migrating cases in each country 91 (77\u201396)% stays in Guinea, 87 (77\u2013100)% stays in Sierra Leone and 100 (88\u2013100)% stays in Liberia. Obviously, cross-border transmissions are much rarer; over the full epidemic 27 (11\u201369) cross-border transmissions are estimated from Guinea, 110 (1.1 \u22c5 10-4 \u2212 221) from Sierra Leone and 0.025 (1.4 \u22c5 10-5 \u2212 86) from Liberia.

As the districts are ordered by time of first observed case, most of these district pairs are in the upper triangular part of each country matrix. District pairs in the lower triangular part indicate that reintroductions in previously infected districts are possibly caused by districts that were later infected. Most introductions originate from districts that were infected early in the epidemic in the border area, i.e. Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and Macenta in Guinea, Kailahun and Kenema in Sierra Leone, and Lofa in Liberia. Once infected, capital cities Conakry in Guinea and Montserrado in Liberia continue to contribute over the course of the epidemic. Despite their large outbreaks, Freetown and West Rural in Sierra Leone play a smaller role in infecting other districts, because they were infected relatively late in the epidemic when most districts were already infected. As observed for the contributions of different districts (Fig 3), most introductions occur within the same country. Guinea, and specifically Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, also contributes to introductions in Sierra Leone and Liberia by necessity, because the epidemic origin lies in Guinea. Sierra Leone seems to contribute most to cross-border introductions, mainly in Guinea and some in Liberia.

The underreporting fraction is varied from 0% (perfect reporting) to 50% (actual number of cases is twice the number of reported cases [20]), to explore how it affects the number of migrated cases between countries (Fig 5). In general, the results become more variable when underreporting increases, but two trends are notable. First, the number of migrations within Guinea increases, due to the larger number of cases, while the migration fraction in Guinea decreases from 8.1% to 6.7% (Fig. E in S1 Text, section 4). Secondly, the number of cases from Sierra Leone to Guinea on average decreases by a factor six. In fact, the contribution of Sierra Leone to introductions in Guinea all but disappears (Fig. F in S1 Text, section 4).

This spatiotemporal method combines a model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers in one location [17, 18] with spatial dispersion to other locations [19]. Through this combination, it is possible to quantify between-district transmissions and identify dominant contributors and the relative role of different districts and countries. Our results suggest that, in Liberia, mainly within-country transmissions occurred, while Sierra Leone seems to have contributed considerably to new introductions in neighbouring Guinea. Some evidence of these cross-border transmissions has been provided by phylogenetics and transmission chains. A phylogenetic analysis of sequence data of viruses from all affected countries [22] showed that the virus (lineage B) was reintroduced from Sierra Leone into Guinea. On the other hand, a similar analysis with more Liberian sequences [23] revealed that multiple introductions from Liberia to Guinea occurred in the later stages of the epidemic. An analysis of transmission chains [24] also identified a transmission occurrence from Sierra Leone to Conakry in Guinea. In the same study, the first introduction in Conakry was traced back to Dabola. Our model, however, identified Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou as most likely origin because the first case in Conakry preceded the first case in Dabola by two weeks in the district case data.",

Although the weekly incidence data of probable and confirmed cases were augmented to include suspected cases, we assume that these data are complete and that the reporting weeks are free of error. If underreporting were constant over time and space, the estimated parameters are expected to be robust. Heterogeneities in reporting over space would only affect the spatial dispersion parameters, while heterogeneities in reporting over time would also affect the reproduction numbers. The effect of underreporting in Guinea is explored in a sensitivity analysis, choosing a maximal underreporting fraction of 50%, which was used by the WHO for planning the emergency response [20]. For different situations, this fraction is either too high [25] or should be even higher [26]. The sensitivity analysis shows that, in particular, the cross-border transmissions from Sierra Leone are affected, but other cross-border and within-country transmissions as well as the model parameters are fairly robust. Taking underreporting properly into account is only possible if additional independent data are collected to quantify the extent of underreporting, such as phylogenetic information [27] or data on case fatality rates [28].",

Our sensitivity analysis shows that this new value supports the results. The serial interval distribution is discretised in weeks in the analysis using weekly incidence data.

            "text": "Also for the spatiotemporal model itself, some model choices and simplifying assumptions have been made. Firstly, the spatial dispersion is modelled by a power-law gravity model. This model is preferred over an exponential decay model with non-dimensionless parameters that are difficult to compare between countries, and over a transmission kernel as is often used in livestock diseases [30] that would require estimating two parameters instead of one. Any spatial dispersion model would fit in the current framework, but one should beware of overparametrisation. Secondly, the model requires that the infections in a district are only caused by cases that are observed in that district. In other words, infected persons may travel in their latent period, but only start infecting other people at their destination. For Ebola this can be a plausible assumption, as infectiousness increases with more severe travel-impeding symptoms, but for other diseases this might not be the case. Thirdly, the model considers an introduction consisting of multiple cases as independent introductions, whereas it is often more likely that they are connected. For instance, the first introduction in Grand Gedeh, Liberia consists of four introduced cases (Fig 3) that might well have been one family. Finally, we have chosen to estimate time-independent spatial parameters. The extent of spatial dispersal might have decreased over the course of the epidemic as a result of control measures such as border control. This could be taken into account by specifying the spatial parameters as a function of time or in different control phases. In a first exploratory analysis with two control phases per country, we use as change points 1 August 2014 for Guinea, 21 August 2014 for Liberia, and 21 September 2014 for Sierra Leone. Results (S1 Text, section 6) indeed indicate that spatial dispersal tends to be smaller and more local in the later stages of the epidemic. As most districts were infected in the earlier stages of the epidemic, these results are hardly surprising and not necessarily an effect of control measures. Regardless, the roles of countries in cross-border transmissions are not markedly different from the original analysis with time-independent parameters.",

Such data are in general collected from the start of the epidemic and are often readily shared. In comparison, data on genetic sequences of pathogens may take longer to become available. The number of estimated parameters are kept to a minimum, and do not need strong priors. No underlying assumptions are made on how the reproduction numbers develop over time, instead they are estimated for each district in each week. In this way the effective reproduction numbers can reveal structural changes in transmission due to control or behavioural changes, and it can capture fluctuating incidence data, e.g. in Conakry, Guinea. Also, the migration fractions are independent of the extent of the spatial dispersal. This allows for the situation where few people migrate, but when they do, they do so over large distances, as has, for instance, been estimated for Liberia. The method by Yang et al. [16] does not make this distinction, but includes the home district (at zero distance) in the migration matrix. This may explain why they find a lower proportion of local transmissions (weighted average of 82%) than we do (weighted average of 94%).",

It can however determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. Not restricted to Ebola, the method could be applied to spatiotemporal data of any newly emerging disease where little to no immunity exists beforehand in the affected populations, and for which a reasonable estimate for the serial interval distribution exists. This type of analysis can also be applied during an ongoing outbreak, provided that reporting delays are properly taken into account [31]. Monitoring the local epidemics together with developments in neighbouring districts can help allocate public health resources, and pinpointing most likely sources of infection could help make decisions on movement bans or border closures.

As such, it is an intuitive measure to assess whether the epidemic is under control (Re < 1) or not (Re > 1). These reproduction numbers can be tracked through time, using knowledge of the serial interval distribution, i.e. the period between the time of disease onset of an infector and the time of disease onset of its infectee.

All districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone reported cases at some stage of the epidemic, but 6 of the 33 districts in Guinea escaped infection all together. The cumulative number of cases in the data set amount to 3642 in Guinea, 11317 in Sierra Leone and 4994 in Liberia. The official case numbers (including suspected cases) aggregated by country on 31 May 2015, however, are 3652 in Guinea, 12827 in Sierra Leone and 10666 in Liberia [33], which shows that about half of the cases in Liberia were never confirmed, leading to a large underrepresentation in the district-level data. This is corrected for by adding the missing cases\u201410 in Guinea, 1510 in Sierra Leone and 5672 in Liberia\u2014to the data on district level. For each missing case, an observation week and a district is assigned which is sampled proportionally to the weekly incidence data in the districts (code in S1 Code).
