After informed consent brushed nasopharyngeal swab (Copan\u00ae) samples were taken within 24 hours after admission and analyzed by PCR assays for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus. Data are presented as median (IQR).",

Median ICU stay was 8 (5 to 17) days, with an overall hospital mortality of 12%. Thirteen patients (38%) tested positive for a respiratory virus. The most frequently found virus was influenza (37%), followed by RSV (15%), rhinovirus (15%), MPV (15%), corona virus (9%) and parainfluenza virus (9%). Two of the patients (6%) had a bacterial-viral co-infection (blood culture and PCR positive for Streptococcus pneumonia and rhinovirus in one patient and for Haemophilus influenza and influenza virus in the second patient). Length of stay in the ICU was significantly longer in PCR-negative patients, in comparison with PCR-positive patients (11 (6 to 20) vs. 7 (2 to 8) days, respectively, P3<0.05).",
