Some infectious agents have the genital system as their primary target; they will mainly lead to infertility, abortion, stillbirth or weak newborns. Other agents give a more generalised infection and reproductive problems are only a small part of the picture. This lecture will focus on some important infectious agents that infect the animals during late gestation leading to abortion, stillbirth or foetus anomalies. Infections of the newborn animals the first few days after birth will also be considered.",

When the virus circulates in the cow, it can reach the growing foetus through the placenta. If a cow that is not immune is exposed to the BVD virus in the first trimester, an early embryonic death or abortion may occur, and if the calf is not expelled from the uterus, it may become mummified. However, if the calf is exposed to the virus between 42 and 125 days of gestation, and if it does not die, it may be born as a \"persistently infected\" calf. During the second 3 months of gestation, infection may result in abortion, or the calf will be born with birth defects. Generally if a calf is exposed in the uterus during the last trimester, the virus will have no effect on the calf, except that it will be born with antibodies to BVD. Occasionally a late-gestation abortion may result from a BVD virus infection. While immunity in the cow should help to protect the developing foetus, the protection offered is not 100% since there are different strains of BVD virus and only a few virus particles need to reach the foetus to cause an infection. Mucosal Disease results when pestivirus carriers are infected with a second, more aggressive strain of pestivirus. Most carriers develop MD within the first two years after birth. The infection takes a dramatic and eventually fatal course including fever, severe diarrhoea, lesions in the mouth and nose, emaciation and death. There is no treatment for MD. Cases of MD are far less common than the usually mild first-time BVD infections.",

The disease is characterised by low birth weight and viability, poor conformation, tremor, and an excessively hairy birth coat in normally smooth-coated breeds.

Thus far, there is no evidence of disease progression or risk of other diseases in clinically normal, infected calves. Wild or domestic canids are the natural definitive host, and infected animals may shed large numbers of oocysts in their faeces, which may then be ingested by intermediate hosts such as cattle. It is among the most effectively transmitted parasites of cattle and up to 90% of a herd can be infected.

Variants normally regarded as non-pathogens can cause opportunistic infections in sites of the body such as the mammary gland (mastitis) and uterus (metritis and abortions). E. coli strains that cause enteritis has been classified as enteritoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli and attaching and effacing E. coli. ETEC has fimbrial adhesins F4 (K88), F5 (K99), F6 (987p) and others, and the production of these colonisation factors correlates with enterotoxin production (ST and LT). These strains cause the majority of the neonatal coli diarrhoea.",

The life cycle of the coccidiae involve a definite host and intermediate hosts. The definite host may develop diarrhoeas, shedding unsporolyted oocysts in the faeces. These oocysts can be taken up by different intermediate hosts where they develop cysts in different tissues. Coccidiosis in the definite host can be especially harmful to recently weaned animals and, occasionally, results in losses in other age groups. It causes watery diarrhoea which is sometimes bloody and can even be a life-threatening problem to an especially young animal. The presence of coccidiae in the intestines of an individual does not mean the animal is actually suffering from coccidiosis as coccidiae are everywhere. These protozoa only cause disease when their numbers become so great that damage is done to the host.",
