In view of high prevalence of viral CAP, there was an urgent need to consider routine laboratory detection in hospitalized CAP patients for an adequate diagnosis of respiratory viruses. In addition, considering positive correlation between influenza infection and severe disease, we recommended testing for influenza virus routinely in severe individuals, especially during the active period of influenza activity.",

In Johnstone\u2019s and de Roux\u2019s reports, though aetiology of nonimmunocompromised CAP patients were reported, the real role of virus was not determined [5,16].Whether samples obtained from upper respiratory tract can really mirror the true situation occurred in the lower respiratory tract and lung, it needs to be further studied. Hence, two control groups were introduced in the present study to answer this question. One of the purposes of enrolment of these two control groups was to describe inapparent infection in volunteer individuals without clues of acute respiratory illness within one month and a higher rate of viral infection in ILI patients. Another question was that the extreme sensitivity of the NATs was thought to be due to false-positive previously. Then, volunteer controls in our study turned to be virus negative, just what we expected. Comparison of positive rate of virus between two control groups and CAP patients in our study revealed that false positive of NATs did not appeared in our study. Second, in both ILI and pneumonia patients, seroconversion of IgG did not happen in all viral positive patients. Similarly, in report by Gencay, seroconversion of IgG was found only in 41% of patients diagnosed with lower respiratory tract viral infection [18]. Hence, even if four-fold elevation of virus specific antibody titer did not appear, the positive results from NATs were deemed to be the pathogen of current pneumonia. Similar to Jennings\u2019s finding [3], positive results of virus by NATs in CAP should be considered as the pathogens.",

The presence of chest pain and leukocytosis had been found to be far less common in those patients with a viral infection than in those with a bacterial infection [4,5]. It was similar in our study that leukocytosis was less common in virus infected patients, when compared to viral negative patients. While, Roux demonstrated that chronic heart failure and the absence of expectoration was associated with pure viral pneumonia when comparing to pneumococcal CAP [16]. However, although several variables were associated with some types of pathogen, clinical characteristics were unable to reliably distinguish viral pneumonia from viral negative pneumonia or bacteria pneumonia. All of these differences were clinically insignificant unless combined with the detection of viruses. It should be noted that all of the differences identified in the clinical characteristics among studies, may also be related to diverse geographical, cultural, and healthcare environments, though, this has not been confirmed [25].",
