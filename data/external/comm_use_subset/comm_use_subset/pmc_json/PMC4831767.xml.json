Many of these pathogens are normally present in the upper respiratory tract, but convert to pathogenic status as a consequence of stressful life history events [8]. Yet, individuals of the same age and environment, when exposed to BRD pathogens, vary greatly in whether they develop the disease [9], and the severity of clinical symptoms [10]. This variation suggests that genetic control is involved in susceptibility to BRD. Indeed, significant heritability for BRD resistance [11,12] and differences among breeds [11,13] have been documented.",

Among others, these include antibiotic treatment on a preventative or metaphylactic basis, non-antibiotic alternatives and vaccination [4]. Unfortunately, these strategies have collectively failed to reduce the prevalence of BRD (see citations in [14]). To date, methods for detecting morbid cattle involve subjective visual appraisal and depend on the stage and extent of the disease. However, clinical signs of BRD may often go undetected in feedlot calves [15], emphasizing the need of an objective and reliable early risk predictor [5]. Genomic-based approaches may thus serve as additional methods for control of BRD.",

Examples include mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting trypanotolerance in the N\u2019Dama cattle of West Africa [18], Marek\u2019s Disease in layer chickens [19,20], and mastitis in Holstein dairy cattle [21]. With genome wide mapping and selection procedures based on high density SNP arrays [22], improving disease resistance through selection for resistance at the genome level has become realistic. Furthermore, high-resolution mapping of the QTLs responsible for genetic variation in resistance can serve as a platform to identify the causative genes themselves [23], opening further possibilities for disease control through greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of resistance. For example, recent genome-wide association studies of Crohn\u2019s Disease identified 71 loci associated with the disease [24] and new pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.",

[14] used common clinical signs of BRD, in combination with nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal recess swabs for the diagnosis of pathogens. An alternative well-accepted tool for retrospective diagnosis of BRD is lung lesions monitored at slaughter [28]. Among other categories, lung lesions include abscesses, parenchymal fibrosis, adhesions and emphysema [29]. Wittum et al. [15] found that damage resulting from BRD may leave persistent lesions in bovine lungs. Interestingly, lung lesions resulting from BRD are often found in animals never recorded for clinical BRD [2,6,15,30]. According to Gardner et al. [6], the high incidence of such cases reflected subclinical events, viral rather than bacterial infection, or disease occurrence at earlier stage, before calves were taken into feedlot. Still, pulmonary lesions at slaughter were indicative of BRD occurrence, which had a significant deleterious effect on production, independent of previous diagnosis of clinical illness [15]. In spite of the fact that it is the only practical way to detect subclinical BRD, only a few studies used lung lesions as an indicator of earlier life BRD episodes [4].",

Adhesions are formed as a normal part of the body's healing process and help to limit the spread of infection. They are fibrous bands of scar tissue that span the pleural space, between the parietal and visceral layers of the pleura and often between the lobes of the lungs, or between the lungs and the rib cage, and are caused by repeated episodes of inflammation of the lungs. The fibrin bands may eventually dissolve through fibrinolysis, and the traumatized site continues to heal, but there are cases in which fibrinolysis is inhibited [31]. Thus, uncontrolled fibrosis may render the repair process pathogenic, resulting in excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen, and replacement of normal tissue by permanent scar tissue, which influences organ function [32]. In a recent report [33], calves free of pulmonary adhesions at slaughter were found biologically and economically more efficient than their affected peers. Interestingly, pleural adhesions found in ca. 40% of the calves accounted for reduced growth rate at early life stages [2].",

To circumvent this, we used a moving average of marker -LogP values with a window size of 23 markers (about 100 kb), and a Log drop of 1 to define QTLRs and their boundaries (details in Methods). This worked well and clear peaks with monotonic shoulders were obtained.

Using a threshold of moving average of -LogP = 2 (corresponding to P = 0.01) to identify QTLs yielded 19 QTLRs distributed over 13 autosomes (Table 2).",

However, in this study P-values were obtained by SD adjusted to allele B frequency (see Materials and Methods). The distribution of the SD values against allele B frequency showed no indication of a secondary mode at the high SD levels that would indicate presence of an appreciable group of unstable markers (data not shown). We are not aware of any report on the distribution to compare with of MAF in QTLRs. The high proportion of low MAFs among highly significant QTLRs markers could be a result of recent new mutations, selection, or both. This, however, is beyond the scope of the present study.",

All are part of the repair/wound healing process that might lead to the generation of adhesions (Fig 5). Ten genes, SLCO2A1 [43], TF [44], ABCA12 [45], KIAA0020 [46], CCR6 [47], RAB27A [48], PPP2R1A [49], HRH1 (GeneCards, http://www.genecards.org/), ATG7 [50,51] and IKZF5 [52] are known for their immunological activity. Three genes, NAALADL2 [53,54], SMOC2 [55,56] (GeneCards), PLEKHA7 [57,58], possess the above scar formation activities without apparent immune function (Fig 5). Thus, although they may respond to immunological cues [32], it is tempting to refer to these three candidates as potential exclusive markers for kosher status while the other 15 may serve as markers for both BRD and kosher status. Interestingly, Tizioto et al. [27] showed that one of these three genes, SMOC2, was differentially expressed in lymph nodes in response to BVD infection. It belongs to a protein family that mainly presents in tissues undergoing repair or remodeling [59]. Possibly, in response to BVD infection, SMOC2 plays a role as an early wound repair gene.",

Thus, each marker requires an appropriate SE2(D), depending on its frequency. Consequently, we binned the markers in bins of width 0.1 from 0.0 to 1.0, according to their average pB across all pools (Avg pBi), and calculated average Var(pB) across the markers in each bin. Table 8 shows that indeed Var(pB) maximized in the range 0.4 to 0.6, dropping off to either side, thus justifying the use of Var(pB) according the marker mean pB.

On the other hand, visual inspection of chromosomal scatter charts reveals clusters of significant marker -LogP values (e.g., Fig 1). We interpret these clusters as putative QTLR. Note, however, that high -LogP values are interspersed with very low values across the cluster region. This behavior is related to complex LD patterns observed across small chromosomal regions [68]. Nevertheless, average -LogP value across a cluster region will be greater than in the adjoining regions lacking a concentration of high -LogP markers. Thus, to identify the clusters quantitatively, assign them an overall -LogP value, and determine their boundaries, we used a moving average of -LogP in 1 nucleotide steps taken across a window of markers. QTLRs were declared on the basis of windows having average -LogP above some chosen threshold. For the present study, average spacing between markers was 4,394 bp. Hence, windows of size 23 markers, equivalent to an average window size of 100 Kb were used. The size of a window was chosen to give a reasonable physical length yet not be overly influenced by the -LogP value of any single marker. A moving average of -LogP = 2, corresponding to P = 0.01, was set as the threshold value for declaration of a window as a QTLR. This threshold was set to give a reasonable number of ranked QTLR for further study in depth.",

In such studies, there is usually a monotonic inverse relation between marker significance and marker location relative to the most significant marker; with marker significance ascending monotonically marker by marker to the most significant marker and descending monotonically from that point. With GWAS and high-density marker maps, however, we are faced with the above-mentioned phenomenon where highly significant and non-significant markers are interspersed across the cluster. Consequently, there is no longer a monotonic relation between marker location and marker significance, making it impossible to apply the LOD drop method. That is, considering -LogP values of individual markers of the cluster, going out from the putative point location of the QTL (the most significant marker of the cluster), one will meet one or more non-significant markers, ostensibly setting a LOD drop boundary, but then just beyond these, are a new series of significant markers, clearly part of the same cluster and QTLR (e. g., Fig 2).",

This allowed the use of the LOD drop method for setting QTLR boundaries. For the present study, since we did not have LOD scores but -LogP, we used instead a -LogP drop of 1 (denoted \"Log drop\"). As noted above, for the cluster on BTA 29, the top window had average -LogP = 2.470. Accordingly, the Log drop 1 boundary of the QTLR were at -LogP = 1.470. The upstream and downstream windows with means closest to this value (-LogP = 1.470 and 1.492, respectively; Fig 2) were taken as the boundary windows. Since the windows are located by the average location of their markers, the actual boundaries of the QTLR were from the first marker of the upstream boundary window, to the final marker of the downstream boundary window. These markers were taken to define the final boundaries of the QTLR.",
