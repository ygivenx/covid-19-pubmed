There are numerous vaccine initiatives currently in progress globally [2], but the number of different subtypes of HIV-1 prevalent in different geographic areas has complicated the prospects for a universal HIV-1 vaccine. HIV-1 subtype C is the predominant HIV in southern Africa; therefore, South African isolates of this subtype have been used in the development of candidate DNA and other virally- and bacterially-vectored and subunit vaccines for South Africa under the auspices of the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative (SAAVI) [3-5]. Because of the extent of HIV-1 infection in southern Africa, any immunisation programme will require enormous quantities of vaccine. DNA vaccines are expensive to manufacture, as are recombinant viral and subunit vaccines produced via cell culture. This makes the proposition costly and possibly unfeasible, particularly for the poorer developing countries where HIV infection is prevalent. There is therefore a strong need to develop vaccine expression systems which have the potential to produce vaccines at low cost for these countries.",

Expression hosts include crop plants such as Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and other Nicotiana spp., alfalfa, rice, wheat, potato and soybeans, amongst a number of others. Different expression systems include transient viral vector expression [10-15], Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression [16-18], and the generation of stable transgenic plants [19-21] or cultured plant cells [22] expressing the protein of interest. The majority of plant-produced recombinant proteins have been produced by transgenic plants, and in many cases, transplastomic plants [23]. However, transient expression is a viable alternative: the short production cycle coupled with codon optimisation, suitable promoters and the help of silencing suppressors such as plant virus-derived p19 and NSs [18] means that it can be scaled up to produce high protein yields in a very short time [7].",

However, poor expression levels in transgenic plants and the complex regulatory problems surrounding plant-produced vaccines are the major challenges [27]. Moreover, reports of inadvertent mixing into the food chain of pharmaceutical proteins from transgenic plants in the USA [28] have put transient plant expression into the spotlight as a bona fide production strategy in its own right.",

            "text": "The HIV-1 Gag precursor protein Pr55 Gag as well as proteins p17 (MA or matrix protein) and p24 (CA or capsid protein) resulting from cleavage of Pr55Gag by the viral protease, are potentially good candidates for the development of HIV subunit vaccines (see Figure 1). Pr55Gag expressed in a variety of cell systems can assemble and bud through the plasma membrane to form highly immunogenic virus-like particles (VLPs) [29,30]. These VLPs are non-infectious and morphologically similar to immature HIV particles, stimulate potent cellular and humoral responses, and are safe to administer to animals and humans [31]. Gag VLPs are a promising vaccine candidate because Gag contains the highest density of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of any HIV protein [32,33], and cellular immune responses to Gag in infected people are correlated with control of infections; they are highly immunogenic and elicit Th1-biased responses in experimental animals at low dosage levels [30]; they are relatively stable, and they can easily be used as carriers for other peptides [29]. The native p17 facilitates the intra-membrane associations necessary for viral assembly and release [34,35] as well as being involved in the transport of the viral pre-integration complex into the nucleus [36]. It is well-documented that the risk of AIDS is greatly increased in individuals with falling titres of p24 antibodies [37-40], suggesting that high anti-p24 antibody titres might be necessary to maintain a disease-free state. It is also significant that p17 and p24 together contain the highest density of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of the HIV-1 proteome [33]. There are also indications that p17/24 fusion proteins may form VLPs or tubular structures [41], which could make them a good carrier for immunogenic presentation of foreign epitopes.",

A few studies have also been carried out using the Tat protein [47,48]. Zhang et al. [49,50] showed that HIV-1 p24 could be expressed as a fusion protein with tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) capsid protein in tomatoes. However, the inserted p24 open reading frame (ORF) was not stably maintained. The same researchers subsequently generated stable transgenic N. tabacum expressing the same HIV-1 p24 protein at levels of 0.35% of total soluble protein (TSP) [26]. More recently, P\u00e9rez-Filgueira [50] et al. showed that a recombinant tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-derived vector expressing subtype C HIV-1 p24 in N. benthamiana yielded levels of 100 mg per kg fresh leaf weight. Furthermore, immunisation of rabbits using purified recombinant p24 induced a humoral response in inoculated rabbits that was strong and specific to p24. However, there are no studies reported to date on the expression of HIV-1 Pr55Gag or p17 in plants, and HIV-1 p24 is not seen by many as a good vaccine candidate. While its expression in plants has not been investigated, recombinant HIV-1 p17/24 fusion protein has successfully been produced in insect cells via recombinant baculovirus [41] for mapping domains involved in VLP formation.",

We investigated the usefulness of codon optimisation and of targeting recombinant proteins to the ER and chloroplasts as a means of improving yields, and investigated whether transient expression via recombinant tobamoviruses or Agrobacterium tumefaciens produced better yields than the Agrobacterium-engineered transgenic system. Finally, we assessed both the cellular and humoral immune responses to HIV-1 p17/p24 (one of the most highly-expressed plant-produced HIV proteins) in mice inoculated with this protein, in order to assess the viability of a plant-produced HIV-1 vaccine.",

The strong response to a Gag CD8+ T cell peptide of 117 sfu/106 splenocytes that was achieved with a single inoculation of pTHGagC was increased 2.3 fold (p < 0.01) by a booster inoculation with 64 ng of p17/p24 protein (Figure 4). No improvement in this response was achieved when the dose was increased to 646 ng p17/p24 protein. pTHGagC induced a weak response just above background to a Gag CD4+ T cell peptide, which was significantly boosted (4.7 fold) by 64 ng p17/p24 protein to 209 sfu/106 splenocytes (p < 0.01). As seen with the response to the CD8+ T cell peptide, a higher dose of p17/p24 protein did not increase the magnitude of the immune response to the Gag CD4+ T cell peptide. These increases in cellular immune responses to Gag induced by p17/p24 protein were specific, as there was no significant change in the response to pTHGagC when control leaf protein was used as the boost (Figure 4). Interestingly, the level of response to the Gag CD8+ and CD4+ T cell peptides after a prime with pTHGagC and boost with p17/p24 protein was similar to that of two doses of pTHGagC (Figure 4). The mice in groups 6 and 7 that were inoculated with the p17/p24 protein alone showed no cellular immune response to Gag above background, 12 days after inoculation (Figure 4).",

Part of our objective in this study was to investigate the feasibility of expressing the same gene in plants via recombinant TMV as a cheaper means of making VLPs. While a plant codon-optimised version of the gene produced a Pr55Gag protein which apparently formed recognisable VLPs (data not shown), the yield of protein was extremely low. We investigated whether yield could be improved by truncation or differential localisation of the protein, and showed that sequences downstream of the p24 ORF negatively affected expression, given that either p24 or p17/24 proteins were expressed relatively well, both in transient and transgenic expression systems. Interestingly, while expression of the gag-derived genes used here did benefit from plant codon optimisation, unlike our group's earlier experience with Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) L1 protein expression [52], as in that work we found that determination of best intracellular locale for transient protein accumulation was strictly empirical. Thus, while Pr55Gag accumulated similarly poorly in all locations, and p24 accumulated negligibly in cytoplasm and significantly better in both the ER and chloroplasts, p17/p24 yield was similar in cytoplasm and ER and 20-fold better in chloroplasts. Transgenic expression presented a different picture: cytoplasmic targeting of Pr55Gag resulted in regeneration failure, indicating toxicity; ER-targeted p24 did not accumulate well, although chloroplast targeting was equivalent to transient expression, and p17/p24 again accumulated best in chloroplasts, but to 20-fold lower levels than in transient studies.",

It is also possible that the membrane-associated form could be useful as a carrier for epitope presentation through C-terminal fusions, as is the full Pr55Gag protein made in insect cells [29].

            "text": "This study focussed on the immune response of mice to the leaf protein containing p17/p24 protein and was set up as proof of concept that plant-produced HIV proteins could possibly be further developed for candidate vaccines. As several studies have indicated enhanced immune responses can be achieved by heterologous prime-boost inoculation regimens, we chose to investigate the immune response of p17/p24 alone and its ability to boost an immune response to a DNA vaccine pTHGagC that is known to prime an immune response of mice, which can be effectively boosted by Pr55Gag VLPs [30]. Indeed, the substantial boost by leaf protein containing p17/p24 protein of Gag-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC suggests that HIV proteins produced in plants may be very valuable for expanding immune responses after the immune system has been primed. While both CD8+ and CD4+ vaccine-specific T cells have a protective role, CD4+ T cells are potentially important for the induction and maintenance of CD8 memory cells and stimulation of B cells for antibody production [53-55]. We found the increase in Gag-specific CD4+ T cells induced by the boost with p17/p24 protein is associated with a substantial increase in the Gag-specific humoral responses and a progression in an IgG1 to IgG2a isotype switch. Even though we did not measure Gag-specific Th1\u2013Th2 responses, the IgG isotypes suggest our prime-boost inoculation regimen induces a mixed Th1\u2013Th2 response with low doses of p17/p24 inducing more of a Th1 response, which changes to a greater Th2 type response when higher doses of p17/p24 are used. Although the inoculation with p17/p24 protein alone was not immunogenic in mice, we may find if we use a higher dose with homologous boosts or adjuvant, that a Gag-specific immune response is induced. Results obtained using a classic western blot strip assay for HIV antibodies also showed a clear boosting of the DNA-induced response, apparently to a greater degree than obtained by DNA prime-DNA boost (see Figure 6).",

However, it is now considered a genuine protein expression strategy in its own right that can potentially yield large amounts of protein [7,13,56,57]. Additionally, the short production cycle can reduce costs considerably compared to the equivalent transgenic case. The use of post-transcriptional silencing suppressors such as p19 and NSs [18], as well as increased protein stability after targeting proteins to cellular organelles, can further enhance the expression level. Furthermore, technologies have been developed to extract and purify antigens produced in plants for use in multi-component vaccines or immunogenic presentation of epitopes on VLPs or virions [7,13,56].",

However, a possible advantage lies in the fact that translation of the targeted proteins occurs in the cytoplasm, and then the proteins are imported into chloroplasts: when they are inside the chloroplast, the targeted proteins are then folded correctly,, making them more appropriately immunogenic. Using transit peptide tags might therefore overcome the limitations of using transplastomics, which include product insolubility, a lack of post-translational modifications, less established chloroplast transformation protocols and biosafety concerns of the horizontal transfer of transgenes from chloroplasts of transplastomics to bacteria under lab conditions [58].",

We demonstrated the positive effects on protein yield of plant codon optimisation, specific intracellular targeting, and protein composition. In particular, a p17/p24 fusion protein accumulated to relatively high levels in chloroplasts, was relatively easily partially purified from plants, and could be used to significantly boost both cellular and humoral immune responses in mice previously injected with an HIV DNA vaccine.

Splenocytes were plated in triplicate at 5 \u00d7 105/well in a final volume of 200 \u03bcl R10 culture medium (RPMI with 10% heat inactivated FCS, Gibco, containing 15 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 100 U penicillin per ml, and 100 \u03bcg streptomycin). The peptides (>95% pure, Bachem, Switzerland) GagCD8 AMQMLKDTI and GagCD4 NPPIPVGRIYKRWIILGLNK were used as stimuli in the assay at a final concentration of 4\u03bcg/ml. Reactions containing an irrelevant H-2Kd binding peptide TYSTVASSL (obtained from Elizabeth Reap, AlphaVax) or without peptide served as background controls. Spots were detected with the detection antibody at 22 h, developed with Nova Red then counted using a CTL Analyzer (Cellular Technology, OH, USA) with Immunospot Version 3.0 software. The average number of spots in triplicate wells was calculated and results are expressed as the average number of spot-forming units (SFU) per 106 splenocytes \u00b1 the standard deviation (SD). For each group of mice the average background spots obtained in the absence of peptide and in the presence of the irrelevant peptide plus one standard deviation of this average was considered as the cut-off for a positive response.",
