            "text": "Aerosols are defined as liquid or solid particles suspended in the air by humans, animals, instruments, or machines. Bio-aerosols are aerosols consisting of particles of any kind of organism [1, 2]. The characteristics of bio-aerosols differ depending on environmental influences such as humidity, air flow, and temperature. Aerosols, which are responsible for the transmission of airborne micro-organisms by air, consist of small particles named droplet nuclei (1\u20135\u03bcm) or droplets (>5\u03bcm). Droplet nuclei can stay airborne for hours, transport over long distances and contaminate surfaces by falling down [1]. It has been proven that droplets can contaminate surfaces in a range of 1 meter (3ft) [2]. The droplets are capable of penetrating deep into the alveoli, offering a potential route of infection [3]. The susceptibility of acquiring an infectious agent is determined by factors such as: virulence; dose; and pathogenicity of the micro-organism; and the host\u2019s immune response [3\u20135]. Humans generate bio-aerosols by talking, breathing, sneezing or coughing [1]. Based on the infectious status of a person, the bio-aerosols are proven to contain influenza or rhinoviruses [6, 7], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [3], Staphylococcus aureus, Varicella Zoster Virus, Streptococcus spp. or Aspergillus spp. [8]. Moreover, bio-aerosols can be generated by devices such as ventilation systems, showers and high energetic instruments running on tap water. Showers and instruments cooled with tap water are able to spread environmental microbes such as Legionella spp. or other bacteria originating from water sources or water derived biofilms from tubing [4, 5, 9].",

            "text": "Due to the nature of their profession, healthcare workers (HCWs) are at higher risk to acquire pathogenic micro-organisms. Their risk of exposure is in line with the infectious nature of their patients, interventions or instruments that produce bio-aerosols. HCWs working in wards with patients suffering from pneumonia, who produce high virulence bio-aerosols, or HCWs exposed to bio-aerosol sources in dental practices, are at higher risk for developing disease or allergies [10, 11]. According to a risk assessment study, conducted in a hospital with HCWs exposed to high risk procedures, a risk ratio (RR) of 2.5 was found for acquiring viral or bacterial infection [12]. Multiple studies have found that HCWs were at higher risk to acquire an infectious disease, observing a high serological status of Legionella spp. and high rates of asymptomatic tuberculosis in dental practitioners and hospital staff [10, 13\u201315]. It is plausible that other diseases could also be acquired via bio-aerosols. Finally, evidence shows that patients with cystic fibrosis, who are immunosuppressed, are highly susceptible to airborne agents like Pseudomonas spp. [16]. Knowing this, we can assume that bio-aerosols with a high load of micro-organisms are a threat to immunocompromised patients suffering from leukemia, psoriasis, aplastic anemia and others [17]. Thus, the risk of acquiring pathogenic agents by bio-aerosols may be a hazard to both healthy and immunosuppressed patients as well as to HCWs.",

Studies conducted in hospitals reported 30 different bio-aerosol generating sources. Humans produced aerosols by coughing, and sneezing. Patients with cystic fibrosis positive for Burkoderia cepacia were also capable of producing pathogenic aerosols. Interventions conducted by HCWs that produced aerosols were: colonoscopy, tracheal intubation, suction before and after intubation, manipulation oxygen mask, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation, insertion of nasogastric tube, defibrillation, chest physiotherapy, and washing the patient. Bed making, ward rounds, tea trolley round, activity at bed, floor mopping, moving furniture, lunch time, drugs round, evening meal, vacuum cleaner, toilet use, cold-mist humidifier, shower, cleaning patients room and the nebulizer were found to be other activities in a hospital to produce aerosols [22].",

The studies combined identified a total of 111 organisms by using culture techniques (see Table 1 for overview of micro-organisms identified and Table 2 study characteristics hospital setting). Fifty-six bacterial species (23 Gram-negative and 32 Gram-positive; 1 mycobacteria), 45 fungal genera and ten viral species were identified[11, 30, 35\u201337, 39, 41\u201352, 54, 56\u201366] Most bacteria originated from human skin or the human gut, the environment or water. The identified viruses originated from the human respiratory tract. The methods for collecting air samples from the bio-aerosols and the methods for culturing micro-organisms were heterogeneous. The method most frequently used to actively collect micro-organisms was the Andersen air sampler (N = 9). Four studies used passive collection of micro-organisms by placing Petri dishes with agar. In all studies, 21 different culture methods were used, wherefrom Tryptic soy agar (N = 7) was most frequently used.",

The mean Log-10 of CFU/m3 ranged from 0.8 to 3.8 (see Fig 2). Additionally, five studies analyzed the bio-aerosol contamination before and/or after treatment, intervention or of a room when a patient with an infectious disease was present. The measured bacterial or fungal load ranged from Log 0.6\u20134.2 at baseline to Log 1.2\u20134.3 after the second measurement (see Fig 3) [30, 35, 43, 56, 57]. Seven studies reported on the fungal load in bio-aerosols during the day when patients were present in a hospital room. Fungal loads ranged from Log 0.8\u20133.5 CFU/m3 in various hospital wards [45, 47, 50, 56, 59, 61, 66]. Multiple studies quantified the air in patient specific areas or via specific methods.",

Thirteen different culture methods were used to identify the collected micro-organisms, of which Tryptic soy agar (N = 3) and blood agar (N = 3) were used most often.",
