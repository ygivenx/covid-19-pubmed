WYMV can serologically cross-react with wheat spindle streak mosaic virus [17], and RT-PCR is not perfect either.",

The final products of RT-LAMP were a mixture of stem-loop DNAs with various stem lengths and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops. For WYMV-positive sample, the linearized DNA form showed up in the lane by agarose gel analysis. Many pyrophosphate ions were produced during RT-LAMP, and the production of a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate gave the tube a turbid appearance that could be observed directly. The positive tube was cloudy and the negative one was clear. With four sets of primers, the RT-LAMP reaction mixture was observed by the naked eye, and the amplification reactions were confirmed by complementary procedures, such as gel electrophoresis. Five microliters of amplified DNA fragments were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose in TBE buffer.",

The RT-LAMP assay was performed at different times and virus was detected after 30-45 min by agarose gel analysis, considering the field application where the turbidity will be observed by naked eyes as the criteria to judge that the sample is negative or positive, the reaction condition at 65\u00b0C for 80 min was used according to previous studies and the results obtained here. The RT-LAMP method had detection sensitivity about 100 times more than RT-PCR in the present study, which was similar to that reported by Boubourakas [33]. Therefore, RT-LAMP was demonstrated to be a simple and time-saving method compared with RT-PCR for routine detection of WYMV, and it did not require specialized PCR and electrophoresis equipment. Due to the high level of detection sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method, careful and strict operation was necessary during the whole process to avoid false-positive results [34]. Other factors to consider are DNA smear and turbidity. Similar to products generated by PCR, DNA smear was present in the healthy control, which may due to an excess amount of RNA used in the reaction and some non-specific reactions [31]. If the DNA smear is strong enough, it can influence observation of turbidity. Turbidity can be observed directly, but DNA smear can also produce turbidity when the concentration of RNA template is sufficiently high. Therefore, when turbidity is used to differentiate positive and negative samples, the amount of RNA template should be maintained at a low level.",
