The kennel has around 20 dogs including breeding females and males, a variable number of young dogs, older retired dogs as well as visiting dogs. This kennel consequently represent a very active environment with dogs coming and going, potentially introducing new pathogens or allowing amplification of pathogens already present. The dogs at the kennel are very well taken care of and receive routine vaccinations, including first vaccination of puppies at 6 weeks of age, and other veterinary treatments provided by a local veterinary hospital. In September 2017 the kennel had 3 litters (around 30 puppies) born within the same week, and while the puppies initially did well, the puppies in one of the litters, and born by a female dog having been stationed away from the kennel at a private home until only one week before giving birth, showed relatively severe signs of gastrointestinal disease when approximately 5 weeks of age. Several of the puppies were examined at the local veterinary hospital and tentatively diagnosed with, and treated for, campylobacter infection. The puppies recovered well and at the age of approximately 7 weeks when they were in good health again, we took environmental samples as detailed below for analysis by next generation sequencing. The aim was to determine if next generation sequencing could be used to identify the possible cause(s) of the gastroenteritis.",

The puppies were sick with diarrhoea/intestinal problems and Campylobacter was tentatively diagnosed at the local veterinary hospital. Samples were obtained 10\u201314 days after resolution of clinical signs, and a reasonably high level of canine astrovirus reads was detected. This may have been the cause of the clinical disease, however a few reads matching bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA belonging to the genus Campylobacter, including the species Campylobacter canadensis and Campylobacter upsaliensis, were also identified among the NGS reads (data not shown). Both of these bacteria are known to cause enteric campylobacteriosis in companion animals and possibly in people24\u201326. Therefore, the severe clinical disease seen in this case may have been as a result of co-infection with astrovirus and Campylobacter, although it is also possible that the astrovirus infection only occurred after an initial Campylobacter infection. The fact that astrovirus was only detected by PCR shortly after clinical disease was observed, and not two and half months later, indicates that this virus was not continually circulating in dogs on the property, and that its presence was at least temporally associated with the clinical disease.",

There are several reports in the literature where astrovirus infection has been associated with gastrointestinal disease in dogs in Australia14, UK15, China7, Korea27, Brazil28, Italy5 and Japan29, and some reports where it was detected in the absence of clinical gastroenteritis17,30. Similarly, in humans, astrovirus is one of the major cause of gastroenteritis in children31, yet asymptomatic infections have also been observed32,33. In this study, we speculate that the astrovirus positive puppies may have differed in their neutralizing antibody levels to astrovirus obtained from their mothers, or in the possible co-infections such as Campylobacter spp. present with the astrovirus, resulting in the difference in their disease status. The low level of parvovirus identified in the puppies appeared to be residual vaccine virus, and was therefore unlikely to be involved in the clinical disease. Ideally, sampling during the episode of gastroenteritis would have allowed better determination of the infections present at the time of the clinical signs, however the value of NGS to detect co-infections is clearly demonstrated here.",

Analysis of the ORF2 region, which is the most variable part of the genome, showed that the closest related sequence was FM213330-AVD-3-Italy-2005, identified in Italy about 12 years earlier. Australia and the United Kingdom/Europe are geographically remote, however dogs do move between these countries, and dog semen is imported to and from Australia for breeding programs34,35. It is therefore possible that an ancestor canine astrovirus was transported to/from Australia through one of these routes. Astrovirus is not currently screened for routinely as part of export/import quarantine requirements and therefore any movement of the virus between countries would have gone undetected at the time.",

This suggested that these viruses possibly belonged to different serotypes. These viruses also fell into different phylogenetic clusters when other sections of the genome were compared. These viruses were identified from dogs in the same geographical region, and this suggests that there is likely a significant diversity of canine astroviruses circulating in Australia. However it would be necessary to culture and isolate this virus in vitro to characterize its serotype, but the adaptation of some astroviruses to grow in cell culture can be challenging36,37 and hence it was not done as part of this study.",

The studies described here were performed in accordance with all relevant guidelines and regulations and as only environmental samples were included, do not require animal ethics approval. Swabs were placed in Universal Transport Medium (UTM) and stored on ice overnight. The following morning, swabs were aliquoted and frozen at minus 80 \u00b0C until analysis. The samples analysed in the present study included faecal samples from 2 puppies (1 from the group of puppies with prior gastrointestinal disease and 1 from a group of puppies from the litters without signs of disease), and saliva samples from the same two groups of puppies with and without prior disease, respectively. To reduce initial NGS testing costs, the 2 faecal samples were combined and the 4 food bowl swabs (saliva samples) combined, so that the study included a single pooled faecal sample DF-1-2-AUS-2017 and a single pooled saliva sample DS-3-4-5-6-AUS-2017. The four saliva samples were also later processed separately for testing with NGS to better investigate the viruses present in the individual dogs. In mid-January 2018, two and half months after the initial sampling of the puppies, the kennel was revisited and individual faecal samples were collected from 7 dogs aged between 3 days and 2 years old to determine if a canine astrovirus, present at the initial sampling, was still circulating there.",
