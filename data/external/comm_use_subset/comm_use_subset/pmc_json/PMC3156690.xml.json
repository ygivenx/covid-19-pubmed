The virus is of the Alphavirus genus in the Togaviridae family [1], [2]. CHIKV has been shown to infect and be transmitted by Ae. aegyptii and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. It was identified in East Africa in the early 1950s and since then has caused epidemics in continental Africa, the Indian Ocean region, and countries of Southeast Asia such as India, where since 2006 suspected cases have been estimated to be 1.39 million, and Singapore [3]\u2013[6]. The only reported outbreak outside these areas was in Italy in the Emilia Romagna region in 2007. Small non-epidemic imported cases have been reported in other regions such as North America, France and Japan, which were caused by travelers returning from affected areas [7]\u2013[9].",

The Ae. albopictus differs in susceptibility to various genetically different isolates of the virus compared to the Ae. aegyptii\n[12]. CHIKV is now of global health concern since expansion of mosquito vectors has created potential for the Chikungunya virus to spread to temperate areas as Ae. albopitcus inhabits regions in North America and Europe [2], [13].",

A bent posture is often taken by those in severe joint pain after being infected with CHIKV. CHIKV symptoms start 4 to 7 days after exposure and most resolve within the acute phase of the disease. Although the acute phase lasts approximately 2 weeks, joint pain can persist for months or years following initial infection [1], [14], [15]. Minimal research has been done investigating the immune response following CHIKV infection. Currently, there is no CHIKV specific therapeutic available.",

The virus brought to the Emilia Romagna region by a traveler returning from a CHIKV affected country was of the Central/East African genotype and matched most closely (100% amino acid identity) with the IND-06 virus isolated from the Reunion Island outbreak [14], [17]. The amino acid identity confirmed that this virus included a substitution mutation in the E1 envelope protein (E1-A226V) [19] which is important for viral entry into host cells. This mutation was acquired during the 2005-2006 Indian Ocean CHIKV outbreak and increased the virus's infectivity to the Ae. albopictus mosquito [20].",

Ng and colleagues established cytokine profiles from 10 CHIKV patients that were infected during the Singapore 2007 CHIKV outbreak [22]. Although this study reported that IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and RANTES were correlated with severe acute phase CHIKV disease, cytokine profiles were not determined for the progression and convalescence of the disease. Here we investigated cytokine profiles during the acute phase and 6- and 12-month follow-up of CHIKV infected patients of the Italian 2007 outbreak. Since CHIKV disease can have severe acute phase symptoms and be followed by persistent symptoms in the convalescence phase it was important to investigate the immune response responsible for these maladies. Furthermore, the Italian CHIKV included the A226V mutation and the Singapore virus did not. Furthermore, we analysed the relationship between cytokine levels and patient severity, and IgG levels linking high CXCL9, CXCL10 and IgG levels with disease severity. Therefore, the results presented here are virus specific and reflect previously unreported cytokine profiles which may be important for the development of future therapeutics for CHIKV outbreaks.",

Collaboration with the regional microbiology reference laboratory of Bologna University and the Department of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases of the National Institute of Health in Rome was initiated and identified the patients as having CHIKV. The clinical criteria was described as acute onset of fever (>38.5\u00b0C) and severe arthralgia not explained by other medical conditions. CHIKV infection was confirmed by one or more of the acute phase tests: virus isolation, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) positive for CHIKV nsp1 gene, seroconversion to virus-specific serum antibodies collected at least 1 to 3 weeks apart, or presence of virus-specific IgM antibodies in a single serum sample collected [15]. Acute CHIKV patient samples were determined to be in the viral stage if the sample was PCR positive for CHIKV (7 patients), in the IgM antibody initiation stage if the sample was PCR negative, IgM positive, IgG negative (6 patients) or in the seroconversion stage (22 patients) if the sample was PCR negative, IgM positive and IgG positive. The samples were considered to be high IgG if the IgG level was greater than 6400 (6 months) (31 patients high out of 50) or greater than 3200 (12 months) (20 patients out of 50). IgG levels below or equal to these thresholds were considered low IgG. CHIKV patients were considered to be non-symptomatic (15 patients out of 50 at the 6-month follow-up; 34 patients out of 50 at the 12 month follow-up), have mild symptoms (21 patients out of 50 a the 6 month follow-up; 14 patients out of 50 at the 12 month follow-up), or have severe symptoms (14 patients out of 50 at the 6 month follow-up; 2 patients out of 50 at the 12 month follow-up) based on their responses to a questionnaire at the time of sampling which was based on: articular pain, muscle pain, mono-arthritis, oligo-arthritis, symmetric polyarthritis, asymmetric polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, arthralgia and fibromyalgia.

Although historically the virus only caused a disease of mild symptoms, a recent outbreak on La Reunion Island caused significant mortality due to genetic alterations [1], [20], [22], [25], [26]. Here we have investigated the immune response of an Italian population infected with the Indian Ocean genotype of CHIKV and have generated a cytokine signature for the initial infection to convalescence phase of CHIKV disease, the signature of viral and antibody production phases, and identified cytokines raised in patients with severe symptoms. We found that initial infection and the subsequent convalescence were described by a set of decreasing and increasing cytokines. Furthermore, we have shown that CXCL10 and IL-10 levels were associated with the viral stage of the acute phase and CXCL10 and CXCL9 with high IgG levels of the 6-month follow-up. As well, CXCL10 and CXCL9 were markers of symptom severity. Importantly, these identified signatures depict the immunological programs and may be key to the development of therapeutics for the frequently re-emerging CHIKV disease.",

            "text": "Our analysis has indentified 2 cytokine profiles that followed disease onset and continued with disease progression/convalescence. We found CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2 and IL-6 levels were high in the acute phase and decreased as patients convalesced. Conversely, the trend for TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-12 were low initially and increased as patients began to recover from acute illness. High levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and IL-6 in the acute phase possibly indicated an inflammatory program initiating adaptive T-cell immunity [27]. CXCL9 and CXCL10 are both chemokines induced by IFN-\u03b3 and are part of the chemokine program that regulates the migration of monocytes/macrophages, memory T cells and NK cells and are associated with the polarization of T cells [27]. IL-6, a pleiotropic cytokine, has a destructive role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), contributing to joint inflammation as well as joint pain [28], [29]. The increased IL-6 levels in the acute phase of our study may be the initiating factor of the severe joint pain symptoms reported in CHIKV patients which mimics RA. Furthermore, IL-6 is important during acute phases of the disease by acting as an important immune mediator of fever activating muscle metabolism to increase core body temperature [28]. Since fever is a common symptom of acute CHIKV disease, it is highly probable that the high IL-6 levels were contributing to the acute fever and the IL-6 decreasing trend followed patient core body temperature as it returned to resting temperature in the follow-up.",

Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which are known to co-induce the other's expression, are both involved in chronic inflammatory diseases such as RA, chronic hepatitis B and C infection [23], [29], [30]. Importantly, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are main contributors to joint pain, which is the major symptom of RA. An internal balance of TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 levels is imperative as mis-regulation of either has been shown to be a major proponent of chronic diseases (RA). Our data indicated that these cytokines increased significantly during patient convalescence above those of the control group, but were not statistically changed in patients reporting mild or severe symptoms. These data may imply that the increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the convalescence phase were not a major contributor of chronic damage causing persistent severe joint pain symptoms during the Italian outbreak even though these cytokines have previously been found to play a destructive role in chronic inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1 immunomodulators have previously been used as a common treatment for RA and IL-1\u03b2 immunomodulators are effective with other chronic diseases such as systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in adult onset Still's diseases [29], [31]. Taken together, these findings suggest TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 therapies would not be effective controlling the prolonged symptoms of CHIKV disease since the raised levels during convalescence were not associated with patient severity.",

Ng and colleagues, investigated 30 cytokines and growth factors from 10 acute phase CHIKV patients, determined that the levels of 8 cytokines, 2 chemokines and 3 growth factors were significantly raised in patients compared to those of the control group. In accordance with their data, IL-6, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were also increased in the acute phase of our patients as compared to control. Since the results from the previous study did not follow the patients during convalescence, our study added significant insight to the progression of CHIKV disease. We found that these three cytokine levels decreased as the patients convalesced as discussed above. Conversely, we found CCL2 also to be increased in the acute phase compared to that of the control group, which was unchanged in the Ng study. Furthermore, Ng et al. found IL-5 and IL-10 were significantly increased in the acute phase where our data indicated that IL-5 and IL-10 were initially low and below control levels and increased following the acute phase. These discrepancies can possibly be explained by the patient populations: the Ng study patients and our patients were from significantly varied genetic backgrounds (Asian and European, respectively). Therefore, differences in immune response may reflect variations in immunological genetic programs. As well, the virus that caused the two outbreaks also differed genetically. Even though the virus that caused the Singapore outbreak was the same genotype as the Italian virus, the virus that infected the Italian patients had the A226V mutation in the E1 gene which was acquired on La Reunion Island [19]. Although the impact of this mutation has been shown to increase vector infectivity [20], the mutation has not been investigated on the human or mammalian immune response.",

As the viral load decreased in the WNV patients, IgM antibody levels were initiated and followed by IgM conversion to IgG, thereby marking the 3 stages of the acute phase. From this work we were able to identify the stages of the CHIKV patients and compare their respective serum cytokine levels. We found CXCL10 and IL-10 levels decreased as patients progressed through the viral stage to seroconversion. Since CXCL10 is often correlated with viral load, this observation was not surprising [32]. High IL-10 levels in the viral stage may act in an effort to control the IFN-\u03b3 program [33] shown by high CXCL10 levels. Furthermore, plasma levels of CCL2, IL-6 as well as CXCL10 have all been correlated with viral loads in virus infected individuals [24], [34], [35]. It is possible that the decrease of CCL2 and IL-6 we observed subsequent to the acute phase [14] correlated with viral clearance, although not with antibody levels. Analysis of the cytokine/antibody response was carried on to the 6- and 12-month follow-up where we grouped the patients on their IgG levels. CXCL9, CXCL10 and IL-6 were raised in the patients with increased IgG levels at 6 months and CXCL9 at the 12-month follow-up. These proinflammatory cytokine associations with high IgG levels may represent the persistence of an active immune system.",

Previously, CXCL10 has been associated with severe viral disease supporting a role for CXCL10 in severe CHIKV disease [34]\u2013[37]. These studies did not find an association with CXCL9 and severity as seen in our CHIKV patients. Our findings suggest high CXCL10 and CXCL9 associated with severity to be a unique signature of CHIKV. Interestingly, not only are CXCL10 and CXCL9 expressed in RA and other arthritis related disease patients [38]\u2013[41], but they have been shown to be biomarkers for RA symptoms, implying a similar mechanism for joint destruction in CHIKV disease [42]. Moreover, CXCL9 and CXCL10 may be contributors of persistent immune activation in CHIKV disease leading to chronic symptoms, which implies cytokine immunomodulation may significantly improve patient treatment and recovery. Importantly, CXCL10 also has prognostic value in the treatment of viral hepatitis where CXCL10 levels follow disease recovery [43] supporting our finding and proposes a prognostic role for CXCL10 in CHIKV. Furthermore, our data puts forth CXCL10 and CXCL9 as possible drug targets for treatment of CHIKV symptoms in the convalescence phase due to the association with severity; however, further investigation is needed on CXCL10 and CXCL9 efficacy. In addition, not only are the identified cytokines useful as possible drug targets but the cytokine signatures described can also be applied when testing newly developed CHIKV therapeutics. As CHIKV therapeutics are evaluated in the CHIKV disease model, cytokine profiles can be used as an output for determining the efficacy of the novel therapeutics.",

By identifying the immune profiles, we have created a clearer clinical picture of CHIKV disease. Importantly, further investigation is needed to correlate these profiles with disease onset and progression to use the cytokine profiles as biomarkers for severity and symptom persistence. The data presented here suggest that with further investigation, immunomodulators may significantly enhance patient recovery.",
