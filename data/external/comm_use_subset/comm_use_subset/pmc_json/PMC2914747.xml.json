            "text": "For serodiagnosis of human helminthic infections, many currently used tests rely on native antigens, either extracted from whole worms (somatic antigens) maintained in laboratory animals, or cultivated in vitro to obtain excretory/secretory products (metabolic antigens). These natural antigens are limited in availability and suffer from batch-to-batch variation. A number of Echinococcus proteins have been recombinantly produced and tested for use in serodiagnosis [1]\u2013[6] but to our knowledge, only recombinant EmII/3-10 [7], [8] and its related sequence Em18 [9] are successfully applied in commercial test kits. Recombinantly expressed antigens used in diagnostic tests require a high degree of purification to avoid cross-reactivity due to contaminants from the expression system. Unspecific binding and cross-reactivity are major problems with both, extracts of whole worms [10], [11] and recombinant proteins [12]. For improving diagnostic test performance, it is desirable to identify highly specific and highly reactive epitopes from the proteome of the pathogen in question and synthetically produce the corresponding peptide antigens. Synthetic peptides are advantageous for diagnostic applications since they are well defined, easily produced in large amounts, highly pure and often cost-saving if compared to the production of natural antigen in animal models or in vitro culture. Applications of peptides in immunodiagnosis of different parasitic diseases were given by Noya et al. [13].",

In the field of parasitological diagnostics, sequencing of parasites genomes also creates new opportunities. Annotated genomes and proteomes are available for some of the medically important protozoan pathogens, such as Plasmodium species and some Kinetoplastida species. Following the genome of the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi\n[14], the genome of Schistosoma mansoni, a blood vessel dwelling trematode, has recently been released [15] as well as a draft genomic sequence for Schistosoma japonicum\n[16] and more genome data from various helminth species are to be expected in the near future (see for example http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Helminths/ or http://www.nematode.net/). Currently, proteins predicted from ESTs, whole genomes or contigs are available for data mining already from a considerable number of helminth species. Using the sequence data available in the public domain, we have designed and tested a pathway for identifying novel antigens for serodiagnostic test development.",

            "text": "Our selection procedure for peptide antigens relied on the application of bioinformatic filters to collections of protein sequences, including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data. The selection criteria aimed at proteins located to the host-parasite interface. Such proteins are potentially seen by the host immune system and may elicit an immune response and thus represent good candidates of diagnostic antigens. Our in silico analysis therefore prioritized proteins containing a sorting signal directing the protein to the extracellular space (PSORT II [17]), transmembrane domains (TMHMM II [18]), or a C-terminal signature sequence for addition of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (GPI-som [19]). These prediction algorithms require full length amino acid sequences with complete N- and C-termini, thus excluding the use of most EST libraries. The majority of proteins generally display well defined three dimensional structures, which is mostly globular. Our selection procedure preferred sequences in which the chemically synthesized peptide also adopts a natural conformation in vitro. There are two structural motifs meeting this claim. Firstly, the intrinsically unstructured regions (IUR) that lack a well defined three dimensional structure displaying an extended conformation that can be identified for example by IUPred [20]. Secondly the alpha-helical coiled-coil motif predicted for example by Paircoil2 [21]. Alpha-helical coiled-coils are believed to readily fold into a stable structure in aqueous solution [22]. A microarray platform served for testing the diagnostic potential of the peptides selected in silico. Using a high-throughput microarray format brings together the advantages of low reagent consumption and rapid multiplexed analysis. Particularly in diagnostics, the possibility of testing the reactivity of a given serum sample with multiple antigens simultaneously harbors great benefits. Promising candidates identified on microarray were further explored and validated for use in ELISA.",

CE and particularly AE, due to its infiltrative and/or space-occupying growth, are severe diseases with high fatality rate and poor prognosis if managed incorrectly [23]. The importance of alveolar echinococcosis is not represented by the number of reported cases but rather by the severity of the disease in the individual patient [24]. Standard diagnostic tests for human echinococcosis, AE as well as CE, imply imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, x-ray and computer tomography, as well as serological tests based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots [25]. Antigens used in these serodiagnostic tests were developed from crude extracts to purified fractions to recombinant antigens and for E. multilocularis to vesicular fluid originating from in vitro cultivated metacestodes [26]. Despite substantial improvements have been achieved, the main screening test still relies on the availability and quality of native antigens, i.e. hydatid fluid of Echinococcus granulosus cysts collected from naturally infected intermediate hosts at the slaughterhouse. One study reported that source and quality or fertility of cysts are critical for test outcome. This called for standardization of antigens and test methods [10]. To produce a robust and reproducible test for the routine diagnostic laboratory, we have evaluated the performance of chemically synthesized peptides in comparison to natural (EgHF, EM2) [26], [27] and recombinant antigen (EmII/3-10) [7].",

NCBI Entrez Protein Database are compiled from a variety of sources with daily updates, including SwissProt, PIR, PRF, PDB, and translations from annotated coding regions in GenBank and RefSeq. To identify putative membrane or extracellular proteins, the protein sequences were analyzed using TMHMM II [18] for prediction of transmembrane domains, GPI-SOM [19] for prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI) anchor signals, and PSORT II [17] for prediction of protein subcellular localization. All protein sequences were further screened for stretches of alpha-helical coiled-coils using Paircoil2 [21] and intrinsically unstructured regions using IUPred [20]. Both of these structures are believed to adopt native conformation in aqueous solution and therefore constitute major selection criteria. Due to the limited number of Echinococcus sequences in NCBI Entrez Protein Database and few predicted surface proteins containing stretches of alpha-helical CC and/or IURs, the analysis was extended to all proteins with alpha-helical coiled-coil and IUR predictions, irrespective of their predicted locations. This included known proteins previously tested in immunodiagnosis. To narrow down protein regions for selection of 30mer peptides, protein sequences were subjected to prediction of coiled-coil stability by STABLECOIL (http://biomol.uchsc.edu/cores/biophysics/stablecoil). In case of IURs antigenicity predictions were performed using BepiPred [28]. Thus detected regions of high predicted CC stability or antigenicity were favored. To increase solubility, peptides were selected to start and end with a hydrophilic or neutral amino acid and to harbour on average one charged amino acid, either positive or negative, per five residues. In addition, the guidelines suggested by the manufacturer were followed (http://www.altabioscience.bham.ac.uk/pdfs/Intro_to_series_SYNTHETIC_PEPTIDES.pdf). From 11 sequences listed in table S1, 45 peptides were selected according to the criteria mentioned above.",

This cut-off was determined by testing single or pooled blood donor samples (pools made of 5 sera each), calculating average FI intensities plus 4 times the standard deviation. We chose 4 standard deviations rather than 3 because the majority of duplicate values differed in more than 20% from each other. This variation can be explained by unequal spot morphology.

The cut-off of mixW was 0.352, which is in the same range as the cut-off of one of its components, namely longD12. By cumulating the individual results of the 3 assays, the theoretical sensitivity indeed increased from 57% to 70%, but specificity decreased to 82% (table 4). Compared to cumulative positivity, pooling the 3 peptides in one well (mixW) led to a loss of positive test results. In return, the specificity increased due to a loss of cross-reactions.

To compensate for limited sensitivity of individual peptides, we performed ELISAs with combinations of synthetic peptides applied as mixtures for coating. We compared these results to the \u201ccumulative sensitivity\u201d, a theoretical value obtained by summing up the positive results from individual peptide ELISAs for each serum tested. The cumulative result amounted to a theoretical sensitivity of 70%. We did not detect this high sensitivity. In contrast, pooling of 3 peptides in one well led to a loss of positive signals otherwise obtained with individually tested peptides. 8/29 echinococcosis samples were lost through pooling. One reason was suggested by an increased cut-off for pooled peptides. In some sera similar ODs were observed in individual test and in peptides mixtures, but due to increased cut-off for pooled peptides, these sera turned negative. The loss of sensitivity obtained with pooled peptides in mixW could also be due to partial occupation of streptavidin binding sites with less reactive antigen. The same reasons may account for increased specificity. Combination of peptides in one well led to a loss of unwanted cross-reactivity with 5/11 previously false positive signals disappearing. Thus in our study, pooling peptides increased specificity, but lowered sensitivity. In future work peptide mixes might be optimized by combining peptides with equally good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In particular, the sensitivity of mixes is likely increased by continuous search for new peptides with improved diagnostic operating characteristics as substitutes for the least reactive candidates. The behaviour of peptide mixtures applied as antigens in ELISA needs further investigation.",

Thus it might be worthwhile for further studies to adapt the bioinformatic selection criteria to the use of partial EST sequences. Our data points out the need for screening more peptide candidates. Further investigations on whole genome level are likely to provide additional candidates with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, which can eventually be combined to a synthetic antigen pool.

Antibody capture by peptides crucially depends on the accessibility of key residues and therefore the introduction of a spacer molecule to spatially separate the peptide from its carrier protein is vitally important [43]. The peptides in our study were synthesized with an N-terminal AHX-spacer coupled to biotin. The biotin was used to immobilize the peptide antigen to a streptavidin-coated solid phase, i.e. microscope glass slides and 96-well ELISA plates. Coating the biotinylated peptides to non-streptavidin surfaces such as Immulon 2HB (Thermo Scientific) or Poly Sorp (NUNC) ELISA plates, led in those samples tested to discrepancies of duplicate values and mostly reduced A405nm values, in a non-linear manner (data not shown). Immobilization of peptides by direct adsorbance to the polystyrene surface might lead to sterical blockage of key residues necessary for interaction with antibodies and thus decrease the A405nm values. Similarly, HIV-1 peptides showed in ELISA increased test sensitivity and specificity when immobilized via biotin-streptavidin [44]. Surfaces functionalized with streptavidin guarantee a directional, highly dense and reproducible coating of biotinylated peptide antigens. It has been shown that the direction of peptide immobilization is of secondary importance as long as peptides deriving from internal protein sequences are investigated [43]. Interactions of internal sequences do not depend on free N- or C-terminus and therefore attachment of spacer and carrier molecules can be achieved successfully at both termini of the peptide.",
