Upon natural infection, it is known that the host responds by inducing both humoral and cellular immunity against the pathogen. However, most of the currently approved vaccines work by inducing humoral immunity [1]\u2013[3]. For protection against viruses that are highly mutable and frequently escape from antibody-mediated immunity, such as influenza A viruses, HIV, and HCV, humoral immunity is insufficient [4]\u2013[7]. Consequently, the development of vaccines that induce cellular immunity is critical to novel vaccine strategies.",

In general, extracellular antigens are presented via MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T cells while intracellular antigens are presented via MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells [8], [9]. However, a number of reports have demonstrated that a significant level of crossover, so-called \u2018cross-presentation\u2019, occurs in APCs [10]\u2013[14]. Using this phenomenon, novel vaccine preparation inducing antigen-specific CTLs that effectively eliminate virus-infected cells is expected. The mechanisms of cross-presentation have been studied intensively [15]\u2013[17] while the details have been left unclear. Part of the antigens taken via phagocytosis by APCs are known to be translocated into the cytosol and degraded by local proteases [18], [19]. In another pathway, some antigens internalized into endocytic compartments are loaded onto MHC class I molecules [20].",

Since liposome-coupled antigens induce antiviral immunity [24], [25], they are expected to be applicable for the development of viral vaccines without inducing antigen-specific IgEs, which cause allergic reactions.

            "text": "We have previously reported that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes comprised of unsaturated fatty acid are presented to both CD4+- and CD8+ T cells [23]. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis demonstrated that a portion of the liposome-coupled antigens were taken up and processed beyond the MHC class II compartment. In the present study, we confirmed that OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was processed at both the MHC class I and class II compartments (Fig. 1). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was incorporated more efficiently by macrophages than OVA coupled to stearoyl liposomes (Fig. 2). Furthermore, OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was taken up by macrophages even in a 4\u00b0C environment, in which antigen entry could only occur via plasma membrane translocation. In general, antigen processing pathways largely depend on the route of antigen uptake, and liposomes with a certain lipid component are known to fuse with the plasma membrane [27]. The uptake of OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes in a 4\u00b0C environment observed in the present study suggested that oleoyl liposome might fuse with the plasma membrane and thereby allow the liposome-coupled antigen direct access to the cytosol. The role of endocytosis in the uptake of the liposomal antigen was further examined by using specific inhibitors for antigen uptake (Fig. 3). Cytochalasin B treatment of APCs prior to the addition of liposomal antigen in the culture had little effect. However, treatment of APCs with DMA significantly reduced the uptake of liposome-coupled OVA. Consequently, it was suggested that antigens coupled to oleoyl liposomes might be taken up by APCs via at least two pathways, penetration and pinocytosis. The analysis of intracellular pathways of antigens coupled to oleoyl liposomes using confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that a portion of liposomal antigens taken up by APC were translocated to the lysosomal compartments expressing LAMP-1 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the liposomal antigens processed at lysosomal compartment and beyond lysosomal compartment might be presented to CD4/CD8+ T cells via MHC class II and class I, respectively. In agreement with the results of antigen uptake shown in Fig. 3, the treatment of splenic CD11c+ cells with DMA significantly reduced antigen presentation of liposomal antigens to both CD4+- and CD8+ T cells as evaluated by T-cell activation (Fig. 5).",
