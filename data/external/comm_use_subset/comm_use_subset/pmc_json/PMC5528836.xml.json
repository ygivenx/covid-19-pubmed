            "text": "Tembusu virus infection in ducks is caused by Tembusu virus (TMUV), which was first reported in April 2010 in China[1]. The virus can infect more varieties of ducks such as Beijing duck, golden duck, Shaoxing duck, Cherry Valley, Campbell ducks, Jinyun duck, etc. Laying ducks infected mainly demonstrated drops in egg production, follicular rupture and bleeding, and yolk peritonitis. Ducklings mainly displayed standing instability and paralysis, retarded growth, with 10 to 30% mortality rates [2, 3]. Other birds such as Chickens, geese, sparrows, etc were also infected and displayed obvious clinical signs [4\u20136]. So far, the disease has resulted in a great economic loss to the poultry industry and caused wide public concern. There is no specific treatment available for TMUV and the vaccination is an effective way to prevent TMUV infection in waterfowl. The inactivated vaccines and live attenuated vaccines against TMUV have been successfully developed and already used in clinical production[7, 8]. But the live attenuated vaccines could display disadvantages of reversion of virulence and spread, and the inactivated vaccines didn\u2019t display an effective cellular immunity. So the development of a new type of vaccine is very urgent.",

            "text": "TMUV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which belongs to the Ntaya virus group within flavivirus genus, flaviviridae family [9]. TMUV genome encodes a single polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [3]. Among them, NS1 protein is a glycoprotein which is present in cell-surface or in the form of cell-associated protein [10]. NS1 protein possesses several unusual and interesting performances which is closely related to the membrane function and indispensable in the early viral replication, assembly and release of the virus [11]. NS1 protein contains multiple protective T-cell and B-cell epitopes which can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity without the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement [12, 13]. The B-cell epitopes mainly refer to multiple continuous amino acid residues on the protein surface or the spatial conformation of discontinuous amino acid residues. Accurate analysis of the epitopes on NS1 protein is critical for further understanding the mechanism of NS1-mediated immune protection. In recent years, epitope-based marker vaccines have increasingly attracted wide attentions in public [14]. The identification of linear epitopes on NS1 protein would be conducive to the development of epitope-based marker and subunit vaccines, preparation of protective antibodies and understanding protein functions [15].",

Subsequently, mouse splenocytes were fused with sp2/0 murine myeloma cells using 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000, Sigma) according to the procedure described previously[19].

On day five, 50\u03bcL of HAT medium was added additionally in each cell of the 96 cell plates. On day twelve, HAT medium was replaced with fresh HT medium completely. After HAT/HT medium screening, culture supernatants were analyzed by the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, IFA and Blocking ELISA. The positive hybridoma cells were subcloned repeatedly by the limiting dilution method till monoclonal hybridoma cells were obtained. Positive hybridoma cells were cultured in the abdominal cavity of paraffin-primed Balb/c mice to obtain ascitic fluid. The characteristics of monoclonal antibodies were identified using Pierce Rapid Isotyping Kit (Thermo, Rockford, IL, USA).

The study of detection, diagnosis, and prevention and control of the disease is a hot issue in the field of Tembusu virus research. NS1 protein is the non-structural protein of flavivirus, which has important functional properties in virus RNA replication, anti-viral immunity and host recognition of virus-associated molecular patterns[11, 21\u201323]. It is reported that NS1 protein or mAbs against NS1 protein can confer active or passive immunity protection from the flavivirus challenge [24\u201326], which is closely related to the epitopes on NS1 protein. Therefore, it is important to identify the epitopes on NS1 protein for epitope-based vaccine designment and development of epitope-based serological tests. In our study, one B-cell epitope on TMUV NS1 protein was precisely mapped and analyzed which led to a better understanding of host immune responses and the development of new vaccines and diagnostic tools for TMUV.",

Precise analysis of epitopes on flavivirus NS1 protein is very critical for comprehending the mechanism of NS1-mediated immune function. So far, a few reports have described the mapping B-cell epitopes on NS1 protein of JEV[20], WNV[14], DENV[30, 31], and TBEV [32]. And moreover there are also several methods of screening B-cell epitope such as peptide scanning technique, phage peptide library presenting technolog, eukaryotic expression presenting system and prokaryotic expression presenting system. The method of prokaryotic expression system[15, 33] is simple and easy to operate and need not special instruments and technologies. Moreover it is at low cost and common laboratory can afford it in comparison to other methods s. But the method is generally applicable to the screening of linear epitopes and it has extensive workload. Although this method has certain defects, it is very accurate and effective in epitope screening. And so far its application is very broad. In this study, one B-cell epitope was screened by prokaryotic expression system to express a series of small peptides of truncated protein and analyzed by Western Blotting. TMUV NS1-specific mAb was acquired with prokaryotic expression NS1 protein of TMUV. A pane of 16-AA polypeptides of NS1 protein was expressed and one 16-AA polypeptide NS1-27 was screened and identified by 3G2 mAb. In order to accurately map the B-cell epitope, a set of truncated fusion oligopeptides of NS1-27 were expressed. One linear B-cell epitope of 269DEKEIV274 was confirmed by probing the shortened oligopeptide proteins with 3G2 mAb. In recent years, epitope-based vaccine and specific diagnostic tools have received extensive attentions. The B-cell epitope of TMUV NS1 protein could apply into the development of detection methods to investigate whether the detected antibody was a result of inactivated vaccine immunization or live virus infection.",
