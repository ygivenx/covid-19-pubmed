            "text": "Human H5N1 infection is characterized by a severe influenza syndrome, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and radiological evidence of pneumonia [5,6]. Almost all patients have clinically apparent pneumonia, and death ensues within 9 or 10 days on average after the onset of illness. Most patients die of progressive respiratory failure that is believed to be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1,7]. ARDS is a common, devastating clinical syndrome of acute lung injury with high mortality ranging from 40% to 60% [8,9]. Pathological findings show that 64% of ARDS patients may have pulmonary fibrosis (PF) during convalescence [10]. Owing to the damage of architecture and loss of functional capillary units of the lung, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in human can lead to respiratory failure within a few years following diagnostic confirmation, and may correlate with an increased risk of death [11]. PF results as a consequence of many types of severe lung injury and is almost always associated with an inflammatory reaction [12,13]. Some virus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus, can induce the typical ARDS and PF, and most patients eventually die [14,15]. Also, it is possible that patients infected with H5N1 viruses may suffer from PF as a result of ARDS.",

Because clinical experience with avian H5N1 disease in humans is limited and patients mostly die during early period of pneumonia, we know little about pathological changes in the lung during convalescence. Laboratory animal can provide considerable insight into the pathogenesis of the complex process of fibrosis in the lung. Our previous study showed that H5N1 virus could induce the typical ARDS in mice, which was characterized by about 80% mortality, progressive hypoxemia, and pulmonary inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema and hemorrhage [16]. In this study, we used a mouse model to investigate the pathological changes at restoration stage induced by H5N1 viral infection, to provide basis for future investigation into the pathogenesis of PF in human H5N1 influenza disease.",

The isolate was designated as A/Chicken/Hebei/108/2002 (H5N1) (Chicken/HB/108). The complete genome sequences (DQ343152, DQ349116, DQ351860, DQ351861, DQ351866, DQ351867, DQ351872, and DQ351873) of the virus can be obtained from GenBank. The virus caused 100% (8 of 8) mortality of 4-wk-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken within 2 days after intravenous infection with 0.2 ml of infectious allantoic fluid at 1:10 dilution. This virus belongs to a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, according to the criteria of viral virulence [17]. Our previous studies showed that this virus was highly lethal to mice and could cause typical ARDS in mice [16]. The virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs at 37\u00b0C for 32 h, and third-passage virus was gradient purified and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. All manipulations of live viruses were conducted in biosafety level 3+ (BSL-3+) facilities.",

The animals' general behavior and clinical signs, including the food intake, body weight, inactivity, anal temperature (measured with an infrared thermometer) and mortality were monitored daily in each group for 30 days. To observe the food intake, the mice were housed individually, on grids in boxes which were changed twice/week. They were weighed daily and their food intake was measured by offering daily known weights of food and separating and weighing any leftover food in the box at each change.

The severity of PF was assessed. All of the specimens were numbered randomly and interpreted by an experimenter blinded to the experimental conditions. Visual grading of PF was performed by determining the Ashcroft's score, with some modification [18,19]. Briefly, the entire fields of each lung section were scanned under an Olympus microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Ltd.) at a magnification of \u00d7 100, and each field was visually graded from 0 to 8. Criteria for grading lung fibrosis were as follows: Grade 0 = normal lung; Grade 1 = minimal fibrous thickening of alveolar or bronchiolar walls; Grade 3 = moderate thickening of walls without obvious damage to lung architecture; Grade 5 = increased fibrosis with definite damage to lung structure and formation of fibrous bands or small fibrous masses; Grade 7 = severe distortion of structure and large fibrous areas; Grade 8 = total fibrous obliteration of lung fields. After examination of the whole sections, the mean score of all the fields was taken as the fibrosis score for each animal. The lung fibrosis severity in the mice survived on day 30 p.i. was further classified into 4 grades (from no obvious fibrosis to severe fibrosis) according to fibrosis score ranges as shown in Table 1.",

According to the manufacturer's instructions, hydroxyproline was measured using the test kit (from Nanjing Jiancheng Bio, China) to estimate the collagen content of the lung. Briefly, lung tissues samples from mice were weighed and hydrolyzed to release hydroxyproline from collagen. Oxidation of the hydroxyproline with chloramines T and the hydroxyproline chromogen was reacted with paradimethylaminobenzaldehyde to develop a pink color. Absorbance of colored products was measured at 550 nm spectrophotometrically and the hydroxyproline contents of samples were calculated by comparing with the standards. Data are expressed as micrograms of hydroxyproline per gram of wet lung weight (\u03bcg/g).",

At low power magnification, severe distortion of structure and diffuse fibrous areas were observed in lung fields (Figure 3C). The severely affected animals had the typical interstitial fibrosis in lungs, exhibiting greatly thickened alveolar walls with proliferation of cells and the accumulation of matrix in interstitial space bounded by epithelial and endothelial basement membranes (Figure 3D). The diffuse intra-alveolar (airspace) fibrosis was a common finding at this stage. Large fibrous areas were seen with an excessive collagen deposition and cell proliferation in airspaces, which obliterated the alveolar spaces, organized lung parenchyma and severely distorted lung (Figure 3D, 3E, 3F and 3G). Bronchiolar wall was thickened, and numerous fibroblasts proliferated and protruded into the lumen, leading to bronchiolar stenosis (Figure 3G, solid arrow). In addition, the focal alveolar collapse secondary to apposition of the alveolar walls was observed in some section (Figure 3H), and both alveolar ectasia and airspace fibrosis were also found in the same field of lung (Figure 3H).",

However, 18% (4 of 22) of H5N1-infected mice survived the acute stage but develop the accelerated disease progression at late stage, as assessed by the presence of inactivity, weight loss, inappetence and emaciation. Macroscopical and histopathological evaluations showed that these mice presented severe PF. These data show that the survived H5N1-infected mice with fibrotic lung severely compromised the quality of life. It is well established that the lung can be subjected to inflammatory reactions and return to its pre-inflammatory state [12,13]. If viral pneumonia, including H5N1 viral infection, causes a more intense inflammatory process in the lung, the fibrosis, rather than resolution, might become an inevitable outcome. During experiments, we found no secondary bacterial infection, and titers of viruses in the lungs were below the detectable levels on day 14 p.i. Our data is likely to reflect the clinical and pathological evolution from ARDS to fibrosis in lungs subsequently to H5N1 infection in mice.",

Some studies showed that the cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), appeared to have an important role in the control of fibroblast activity in vitro, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PF [23,24]. PF is difficult to treat clinically and few drugs can be useful. Corticosteroid therapy like dexamethasone is the current first-line choice to prevent this disease because of its anti-inflammatory effects [25]. Laboratory studies showed that corticosteroids might prevent the collagen overexpression and decrease the up-regulated cytokines including TGF-\u03b2 in bleomycin-induced PF model [26,27]. Our further study will use the mouse model to focus on the role of cytokines in pathogenesis of PF and the effect of some drugs on PF induced by H5N1 virus.",
