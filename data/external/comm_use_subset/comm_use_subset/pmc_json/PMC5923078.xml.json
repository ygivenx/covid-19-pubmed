Early essential host defense mechanisms involve induction of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and signaling through the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) to upregulate IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISG expression is associated with numerous biological activities, including antiviral and immunomodulatory pathways, e.g., interference with translation, apoptosis, and enhanced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen (Ag) presentation (2\u20134). While the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response is critical in stemming CNS viral replication and spread, it is rapidly downregulated and insufficient to eliminate virus in the absence of subsequent adaptive immune responses (5\u20137). Moreover, the efficiency of the innate response in limiting viral spread sets the stage for the effectiveness of subsequent adaptive immunity (2\u20134, 8).",

            "text": "Detection of viruses and induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are initiated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which differ in subcellular localization and are specialized to recognize distinct molecular entities in virus structural components, genome, and/or replication intermediates (2, 8, 9). PRRs which recognize RNA viruses include endosome-associated membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), mainly TLR3, and the cytoplasmic retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and melanoma differentiation-associated antigen 5 (MDA5). Specialized PRR adapter proteins transmit signals to activate IFN response factor 3 (IRF3), IRF5, and IRF7, which translocate to the nucleus to induce IFN-\u03b2 and a subset of IFN-\u03b1 genes (9). Secretion of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and signaling through IFNAR subsequently activate ISGs and the \u201cantiviral state.\u201d PRR activation also activates nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB)-regulated genes, thereby inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to facilitate recruitment of innate and adaptive effector cells (2, 9). Virtually all nucleated cells are able to induce and respond to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, including CNS resident cells (5, 6). The CNS does not harbor plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are potent peripheral IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 inducers (3, 10), and therefore has to rely on intrinsic induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. CNS resident cells have been shown to differ widely in the repertoire as well as magnitude of basal and inducible transcripts encoding PRRs and factors associated with the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway (5\u20137, 11). As IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling can rapidly induce genes involved in virus sensing and their signaling components, cell types which are not effective initial IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 inducers may nevertheless contribute to the overall innate antiviral activity by efficient IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling and amplification of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response (5, 11, 12). The interdependence of CNS cells in achieving an IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent antiviral state thus requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Microglia and astrocytes are the CNS resident cells most prominently involved in early innate responses to injury, autoimmune attack, or infection (6, 7, 11, 12). In infections these early responses are essential to attract peripheral immune cells and limit viral dissemination (2, 3, 8). Importantly, not only productively infected but also abortively infected astrocytes mount innate responses that contribute to protection (3, 13, 14). CNS infections by several neuronotropic RNA viruses, including La Crosse virus, rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), suggested that astrocytes, not neurons, are the main source of IFN-\u03b2 expression and contributors to virus control through both TLR and RLR activation pathways (14\u201316). Both microglia and astrocytes express various PRRs, and their sentinel function is supported by their rapid response to microbial infection (5, 7, 10, 14, 17, 18). In addition to participating in direct antiviral functions, astrocytes regulate CNS homeostasis, support neuronal function, and participate in formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (19, 20). Both astrocytes and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 actively participate in BBB function to restrict CNS entry of molecules, cells, or pathogens (19, 21). IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling specifically to astrocytes promotes BBB integrity in the cerebellum and protects from West Nile virus infection (22). Thus, both astrocyte IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction and signaling regulate the outcome of infection within the CNS at different functional levels. The essential role of IFNAR signaling in limiting viral dissemination within the CNS is supported by neurotropic virus infections of IFNAR-deficient (IFNAR\u2212/\u2212) mice (3, 5, 6, 23). However, caveats for IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice are the reduced basal levels of factors involved in the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway as well as loss of innate myeloid cell dynamic activity in response to infection (11, 24, 25). Further, while much information on CNS innate responsiveness is derived from primary glial and neuronal cultures, the in vivo studies of IFN-\u03b2 induction highlight how unsuspected players, such as abortively infected astrocytes, contribute to pathogen control (14).",

            "text": "Based on the prominent role of astrocytes in participating in innate responses, this study set out to assess how IFNAR ablation in astrocytes affects pathogenesis in a glia- and neuronotropic coronavirus infection. The murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 infects microglia, astrocyte, neurons, and oligodendroglia following intracranial (i.c.) administration (26, 27). Although MHVs are at best poor inducers of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (28\u201330), they do induce IFN-\u03b2 in microglia/macrophages (18). Importantly, even the low levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are essential to prevent viral dissemination and mortality (31, 32). The studies here reveal distinct patterns of basal and inducible levels of mRNAs encoding components of the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway in astrocytes and microglia isolated from naive and infected adult mouse brains. Despite expressing lower baseline mRNA levels, astrocytes upregulated IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway gene expression to a greater extent than microglia, supporting effective IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responses. Ablation of IFN\u0391R in astrocytes using mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice resulted in severe encephalomyelitis and mortality by 7 days postinfection (p.i.). This contrasted with mild clinical symptoms and no fatalities in infected control IFNARfl/fl mice. Uncontrolled viral spread throughout the CNS parenchyma of mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice not only was associated with increased astrocyte infection but also affected neurons and microglia, despite overall elevated and sustained levels of mRNAs for IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 genes and ISGs. IFN-\u03b3, a crucial mediator of MHV control in the CNS, was not impaired, despite reduced T cell CNS infiltration. Unexpectedly however, defective IFN-\u03b3 signaling was implicated by impaired induction of IFN-\u03b3-dependent MHC class II expression on microglia. Overall our results imply that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling in astrocytes not only is critical in limiting CNS viral spread but also promotes lymphocyte-derived protective antiviral IFN-\u03b3 function.",

Virus replication was monitored by expression of viral RNA encoding the N protein (A59 N), which is present on genomic and all subgenomic RNAs (33).

            "text": "Although MHV A59 replicates in glia and neurons, it induces IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 only in microglia, not astrocytes, using primary cell cultures (29). To assess the relative induction of and responsiveness to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in astrocytes and microglia in vivo, we used infected GFAP-GFP mice to isolate CD45-negative, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive (CD45\u2212 GFP+) astrocytes and CD45int CD11b+ microglia by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Fig. 2A). Measurement of viral N relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs in either glia population revealed viral replication in both microglia and astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. and a decline by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2B). While increased viral N mRNA in microglia relative to astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. did not reach statistical significance, overall viral N mRNA levels mirrored those in total brain. The same populations of purified cells were used to measure transcript levels of the Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 genes, genes regulating IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, signaling and selected antiviral ISGs (Fig. 2C). In naive mice, constitutive expression of these genes was lower or undetectable in astrocytes compared to microglia. Following infection, Ifn\u03b2 mRNA was upregulated by day 3 p.i. in microglia but was not upregulated until day 5 p.i. and was less robust in astrocytes. In contrast, Ifn\u03b14 and Ifn\u03b15 mRNAs were not significantly upregulated in microglia but were increased prominently in astrocytes by day 5 p.i. Consistent with the decline in viral RNA, Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNAs dropped to baseline levels by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2C). Transcripts for components required for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling showed no significant differences between astrocytes and microglia throughout days 3 to 7 p.i. (Fig. 2C). While infection mediated a decline in Ifnar1 mRNA relative to basal levels in microglia by day 5 p.i., it did not alter expression levels in astrocytes. Stat1 mRNA levels varied between cell preparations and showed no significant changes throughout infection in either cell type. Irf9 transcripts were not affected by virus infection in microglia but increased modestly in astrocytes. In contrast, individual ISGs were regulated distinctly not only between the glia populations but also within each glia type over time (Fig. 2C). MHV CNS infection has been shown to strongly induce IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit1 and Ifit2) and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (Oas2) transcripts (11, 31). Although Ifit1 mRNA was increased in both populations by day 3 p.i., the relative induction was significantly higher in astrocytes than in microglia at all time points. In contrast, Ifit2 mRNA was induced more prominently in microglia at day 3 p.i., reached similar levels in both cell types at day 5 p.i., and dropped thereafter in both populations. Lastly, Oas2 mRNA showed peak upregulation in microglia by day 3 p.i. and modest induction in astrocytes (Fig. 2C). Under the assumption that viral mRNA levels reflect similar replication in both glial populations, these data support microglia as superior initiators of IFN-\u03b2 production relative to astrocytes following MHV A59 infection in vivo; these findings are consistent with results from primary neonatal cell cultures (18, 29). Moreover, delayed Ifn\u03b2 upregulation in astrocytes suggested that their sensitivity to viral replication is enhanced once viral sensors are elevated via IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling. This notion was supported by delayed, yet more extensive, upregulation of the Ifn\u03b1 as well as the Ifit1 and Ifit2 genes compared to that in microglia. ISG upregulation further appeared to be independent of direct changes in Ifnar, Stat1, or Irf9 transcript levels.",

            "text": "Many PRR-encoding genes are themselves ISGs and are upregulated during CNS infections (3, 11, 35, 36). MDA5, RIG-I, and TLR3 have all been established as PRRs contributing to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction in MHV-infected microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes (18, 27, 37, 38). Basal Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 transcript levels were all significantly lower in FACS-purified astrocytes than in microglia (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, astrocytes rapidly upregulated Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 mRNAs to levels observed in microglia as early as day 3 p.i. (Fig. 3), when total Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA peaked in the brain (Fig. 1). Relative to basal levels, the fold increase in astrocytes exceeded that in microglia. All three PRR transcripts declined by day 7 p.i., reflecting the decline in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. With the exception of mRNA encoding IKK\u03b5, a kinase involved in both induction and IFNAR signaling, constitutive levels of transcripts for PRR signal transduction factors represented by IRF3 and IRF7 were also lower in astrocytes (Fig. 3). Expression of the cellular kinase Ikk\u03b5 mRNA was gradually increased in both glial populations over time up to day 7 p.i., with increases more pronounced in microglia (Fig. 3). Irf3 mRNA expression was decreased in microglia following infection and remained unchanged in astrocytes, contrasting with upregulation of Irf7 mRNA in both cell types between days 3 to 5 p.i. and downregulation thereafter (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with constitutive IRF3 expression but inducible expression of both IKK\u03b5 and IRF7 following infection or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment of non-CNS cells (39). Overall, the data suggest that initial production of IFN-\u03b2 in microglia results in upregulation of select ISGs in astrocytes, thereby amplifying IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. However, it remains unclear whether astrocytes induce IFN-\u03b2 directly via virus-derived PRR activators or via mediators released from necrotic or apoptotic cells in the inflamed CNS environment. Regardless, the results demonstrate that astrocytes are sensitive responders to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and active participants in the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced amplification loop.",

The anatomical localization and distribution of viral N protein were also evaluated by histology. Compared to small isolated residual foci of viral Ag-positive cells in brains of IFNARfl/fl mice at day 6 p.i., mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice exhibited extensive dissemination with increased intensity of viral Ag staining throughout the brain (Fig. 4C). High-magnification images indicated that virus was not limited to cells consistent with glial morphology but also was in cells with typical neuronal morphology in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice (Fig. 4C, insets). As MHV A59 is hepatotropic following peripheral infection and can spread to the liver following i.c. infection of immunocompromised mice (26), we also surveyed liver for viral N mRNA. The levels of viral N relative to GAPDH transcripts were elevated in livers of mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl compared to IFNARfl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. (values of 82 \u00b1 48 versus 5 \u00b1 3) (data not shown). However, overall viral N mRNA levels were significantly higher in the CNS (9,013 \u00b1 998 versus 230 \u00b1 55, respectively) (see Fig. 8). There was also no evidence of necrotic foci by gross visual examination (data not shown). Mortality was thus attributed to overwhelming virus spread within the CNS.",

To evaluate to what extent the absence of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling in astrocytes predisposes astrocytes over other cell types to enhanced infection, brains from infected mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl and IFNARfl/fl mice were analyzed for viral N protein in combination with antibodies (Abs) specific for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and microglia/macrophages (IBA1). Characteristic staining and colocalization patterns at day 4 p.i. in wt mice are depicted in Fig. 5A. Microglia and neurons showed prominent perinuclear cytoplasmic N protein localization, with some extension into processes in microglia. In contrast, viral Ag was only occasionally detected in the cytoplasm of astrocytes and was localized mainly proximal to, but not overlapping with, astrocytic processes. In this context it is critical to note that the anti-GFAP Ab used to identify astrocytes stains main stem branches but not the cytoplasm or fine processes of astrocytes and poorly stains gray matter astrocytes (20, 40), suggesting that viral protein may localize to astrocytic processes poorly detected by anti-GFAP Ab. Total N protein staining revealed an \u223c3-fold-higher positive area in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl than in IFNARfi/fi mice as determined by pixels per observed field at day 4 p.i.; the difference increased to \u223c40-fold by day 6 p.i., when virus already declined in IFNARfi/fi mice (Fig. 5B). Keeping the limitations of GFAP staining in mind, colocalization of viral Ag with GFAP was overall increased at day 6 p.i. Furthermore, when the relative proportion of the dual-positive area within the total viral Ag-positive pixel area was assessed, percentages were similar in both mouse strains at day 4 p.i. but were 2-fold higher in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice than in controls at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 5C). Viral Ag-positive microglia were also overall increased in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. However, the relative proportion of the dually viral Ag- and IBA1-positive area per total viral Ag-positive area was comparable between groups at both days 4 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 5D). To evaluate the relative infection of astrocytes versus microglia, we also measured the proportions of viral Ag-positive area relative to GFAP- or IBA1-positive areas. While infection of microglia increased from \u223c20% to \u223c30%, it increased from <5% to 15% in astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice between days 4 and 6 p.i. (Fig. 6). Although infected neurons were increased in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl compared to IFNARfl/fl mice throughout the brain by day 4 p.i., they declined significantly in both groups by day 6 p.i. Remaining elevated neuronal infection in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. was still particularly evident in lower and distal parts of the brain (pons and medulla) (Fig. 5E). Analysis of apoptosis to explain the decline in virus-infected neurons indicated overall sparse but more abundant neuronal apoptosis in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice (Fig. 7A). Occasional apoptotic CD3+ lymphocytes were also observed with elevated frequency in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice (Fig. 7B). While these results likely underestimate the extent of viral infection in astrocytes, they support that the absence of astrocyte IFNAR signaling leads to increased viral dissemination most prominently within astrocytes but also to microglia and neurons.",

To assess how elevated IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 affected downstream IFNAR signaling, we further compared mRNA levels of the ISGs (Ifit1, Ifit2, Isg15, Mx1, Pkr, and Oas2). While these transcripts were all similar in both mouse groups at day 3 p.i., Ifit1, Ifit2, and Mx1 mRNAs were increased 2- to 3-fold in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. Isg15, Pkr, and Oas2 mRNAs were not affected or reduced relative to those in IFNARfl/fl controls (Fig. 8). IFNAR abrogation on astrocytes thus did not impair global Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 or select ISG expression in the infected CNS. However, innate immunity by IFNAR-competent cells was clearly insufficient to stem viral dissemination throughout the CNS in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice.",

We therefore evaluated how the absence of IFNAR on astrocytes modulates expression of select NF-\u03baB-dependent chemokines and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) (43, 44). Transcripts for Cxcl1 and Ccl2, potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively, were similar at day 3 p.i. but were significantly upregulated at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 9), consistent with increased viral replication and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated downregulation of CXCL1 by astrocytes (42, 45). Increased Il6 mRNA expression at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 9) further indicated that IFNAR abrogation on astrocytes does not impact proinflammatory cytokine induction. In contrast, Ccl5 mRNA, which is prominently expressed by T cells during MHV infection (46), was significantly reduced compared to that in IFNARfl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. Dysregulation of these proinflammatory factors suggested that myeloid cells may be recruited in favor of lymphocytes in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice, thereby contributing to morbidity and uncontrolled viral spread.",

Consistent with elevated Cxcl1 mRNA, neutrophils in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl brains were increased by \u223c8-fold at day 6 p.i. relative to those in IFNARfl/fl mice, although numbers in both groups were already reduced compared to those at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 10A). Differences in macrophages were not statistically significant (Fig. 10B). As both CD4 and CD8 T cells are essential to reduce infectious MHV, with IFN-\u03b3 playing a prominent antiviral role (33, 47), we further assessed if impaired T cell recruitment and IFN-\u03b3 production within the CNS is associated with lack of virus control. Indeed, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were reduced in the CNS of mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 10C). However, similar IFN-\u03b3 levels (Fig. 10D), despite reduced T cell numbers, suggested that increased viral replication leads to increased Ag presentation, thereby triggering more or prolonged IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice (48, 49). Impaired access of T cells to the CNS parenchyma was ruled out as an explanation of loss of viral control, as we found no differences in anatomical distribution of CD3+ T cells within perivascular and parenchymal sites between the two groups (data not shown). Uncontrolled viral replication in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice despite similar IFN-\u03b3 production thus implied that viral replication overwhelms the T cell response or that IFN-\u03b3 signaling is impaired.",

Furthermore, CXCL9 is produced by macrophages/microglia and endothelial cells, but not astrocytes, whereas CXCL10 is induced prominently in astrocytes during inflammation (53, 57). Assessment of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 mRNAs showed similarly low levels in both groups at day 3 p.i. (Fig. 10G). However, unlike IFNARfl/fl mice, mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice failed to upregulate Cxcl9 mRNA by day 6 p.i. In contrast, Cxcl10 mRNA levels were elevated by \u223c2.5-fold in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. but did not increase in IFNARfl/fl mice. Given that mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice do not express IFNAR on astrocytes, Cxcl10 mRNA upregulation is likely driven by IFN-\u03b3 and/or TNF. Overall, these results implied that microglia, but not astrocytes, are significantly compromised in IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice.",

            "text": "One explanation for the differential responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3 in microglia versus astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice is that prolonged IFNAR signaling via elevated and sustained IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression may skew subsequent IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness. This is supported by an antagonistic effect of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 on IFN-\u03b3 responses in macrophages following IFN treatment or Listeria infection (58\u201360). We therefore used the viral RNA mimic poly(I\u00b7C), a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analog recognized by TLR3 as well as RIG-I/MDA5, to induce Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and monitor IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness. Previous in vivo data revealed that poly(I\u00b7C) administration into the CNS of mice induced Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 mRNA by 4 h, which was sustained out to 12 h (11). BMDM were thus pretreated with poly(I\u00b7C) for 4 or 12 h and subsequently treated with IFN-\u03b3 for 18 h. IFN-\u03b3-only treatment was included as a positive control. Poly(I\u00b7C) alone did not induce Ciita mRNA at 4 h and induced it only sparsely by 12 h. However, while IFN-\u03b3 treatment alone effectively induced Ciita mRNA, it failed to induce Ciita mRNA in cells pretreated with poly(I\u00b7C) for either 4 or 12 h (Fig. 11). Similarly, poly(I\u00b7C) alone only sparsely induced Cxcl9 mRNA at 4 h compared to induction by IFN-\u03b3 treatment alone, and short poly(I\u00b7C) pretreatment suppressed Cxcl9 mRNA induction by IFN-\u03b3. Assessment of an inhibitory effect of prolonged poly(I\u00b7C) exposure was preempted by induction of Cxcl9 mRNA levels similar to those with IFN-\u03b3. Finally, treatment with poly(I\u00b7C) alone was superior to IFN-\u03b3 alone in upregulating Cxcl10 mRNA, with saturation already achieved at 4 h. These results are consistent with poly(I\u00b7C)-mediated upregulation of CXCL10 via IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and TNF and preempted use of Cxcl10 as a target gene to assess suppressive functions on IFN-\u03b3 signaling in this experimental setting. Overall, these data indicate that preexposure of macrophages/microglia to a virus-induced inflammatory milieu including IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 has the potential to negatively regulate subsequent IFN-\u03b3 signaling. However, the magnitude of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-mediated suppression of IFN-\u03b3-dependent gene induction depends on other regulatory elements in the respective target gene promoter. These results reveal that the duration and/or level of cell exposure to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can substantially diminish responsiveness to temporally lagging IFN-\u03b3, thereby reducing IFN-\u03b3 protective functions.",

Our studies comparing the capacity of adult astrocytes relative to microglia to respond to MHV A59 infection revealed that astrocytes expressed lower basal levels of PRRs and signaling components to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and ISGs than microglia, consistent with published gene array data (61). Nevertheless, despite a delay in response to infection, astrocytes exhibited strong upregulation of PRRs, Ifn\u03b1s, and select ISGs, supporting that astrocytes are well positioned to respond to paracrine IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 to amplify their innate antiviral response. The critical role of IFNAR signaling in astrocytes to block viral spread was confirmed by rapid virus dissemination throughout the CNS upon abrogation of IFNAR signaling in astrocytes. Thus, although basal expression levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling components have been shown to determine the responsiveness of cells to insults (11, 62), our data reveal that cells expressing low basal levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 pathway components can nevertheless trigger a protective innate immune response through paracrine IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling.",

This is clearly demonstrated by elevated and sustained Ifn\u03b1/\u03b2 as well as select ISG expression despite IFNAR deletion on astrocytes. However, vast dissemination of virus throughout the CNS clearly indicated that IFNAR signaling specifically in astrocytes plays a dominant role in host protection, which could not be compensated by IFNAR-competent glia and neurons. While microglia appeared to exhibit some autocrine action as suggested by less overall infection relative to that in astrocytes, neurons in the brain stem appeared to be most susceptible and vulnerable to infection in the absence of astrocyte IFNAR signaling. Although we cannot exclude that inherently reduced activation of innate viral components in neurons may contribute to their susceptibility, our data indicate that overwhelming infection of IFNAR-deficient astrocytes increases adjacent neuronal infection. West Nile virus infection of neuronal cultures demonstrates that neurons have the capacity to mount innate viral responses via TLR and IRF activations (63, 64). Moreover, neurons have also been demonstrated to induce IFN-\u03b2 following TMEV and La Crosse virus infection in vivo (65). Nevertheless, these responses were very sparse and focal. In contrast, subsequent studies of La Crosse virus infection in IFN-\u03b2 reporter mice showed that apparently noninfected astrocytes and microglia in close proximity to infected neurons were prominent IFN-\u03b2-producing cells, while IFN-\u03b2 expression by infected neurons was rare (16). More recent data demonstrate that IFN-\u03b2-producing astrocytes appeared to be transiently or abortively infected during various infections associated with neuronal tropism (14). The spatial extent of innate protection induced in an infected environment may thus depend on the prominent infected cell type. As both microglia and astrocytes have far-reaching processes, release of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 from these cells may provide more extensive protection than release from neuronal cell bodies. Two independent studies with VSV indeed indicate that locally induced IFN-\u03b2 in the olfactory bulb can trigger ISGs in distal parts of the brain, although one indicates astrocytes and the other neurons as the prominent IFN-\u03b2 inducers (15, 66). Regardless, the vast increase of virus in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice supports the notion that the inability of astrocytes to clear virus, rather than loss of direct ISG effects on other CNS cells, is responsible for loss of viral control.",

            "text": "Finally, our results show that extensive virus spread in the absence of protective astrocyte IFNAR signaling cannot be controlled by T cells. Although previous studies of CXCL9 and CXCL10 monoclonal antibody (MAb) blockade to reduce CXCR3-dependent T cell recruitment showed a reduction in T cell migration and loss of viral control in a related MHV infection (75, 76), subsequent studies in CXCL9- and CXCL10-deficient mice indicated that CXCL10 is more critical for effective adaptive immunity (57). Impaired T cell accumulation despite unimpaired Cxcl10 mRNA in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice was thus unanticipated. While an overwhelming virus load may lead to Ag-induced T cell exhaustion and death (77), dysregulation of T cells requires future investigation. Regardless of reduced T cell numbers, their initial activity as monitored by IFN-\u03b3 secretion was not impaired. IFN-\u03b3 signaling is essential for MHV control within the CNS by both exerting direct antiviral effects and enhancing MHC class I and II upregulation (78). However, reduced induction of IFN-\u03b3-dependent Ciita and Cxcl9 mRNAs showed that microglia were significantly impaired in IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness. In contrast, increased Cxcl10 mRNA expression in the absence of IFNAR on astrocytes implied that IFN-\u03b3 signaling in astrocytes remained intact. The notion that elevated and sustained IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling acts as a negative regulator of IFN-\u03b3 signaling was supported by earlier reports showing antagonistic effects of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 on IFN-\u03b3-induced activation of macrophages (58\u201360). One possible mechanism may involve downregulation of the IFN-\u03b3 receptor (IFNGR), as shown during Listeria infection (58). Our in vitro studies further supported selected downregulation of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 via pretreatment of BMDM with the dsRNA mimic poly(I\u00b7C). IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent sensitization of microglia/macrophages to subsequent IFN-\u03b3 responses may provide a mechanism to limit excessive immune responses leading to tissue damage. In this context it is of interest to note that both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 responses are tightly controlled by negative regulators, including phosphatases (79). Cross talk between IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 responses may thus provide additional levels to protect the host from exacerbated proinflammatory responses.",
