            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen belonging to the Semliki Forest antigenic complex of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae\n[1]. CHIKV has a single, positive strand linear RNA genome of approximately 11.7 kb and is comprised of two open reading frames (ORF): a 5\u2032 non-structural ORF encoding the non-structural polyprotein, and a 3\u2032 structural ORF that encodes the structural polyprotein of the virus [2]. A unique feature shared by CHIKV with other members of the family Togaviridae is the translation of the structural polyprotein from the 26S mRNA, which is internally transcribed from the negative strand template through the initiation of the 26S subgenomic promoter, located at the junction region between the non-structural and structural ORFs. Based on the genomic organization of other related alphaviruses, the CHIKV genome is considered to be: 5\u2032-nsP1-nsP2-nsP3-nsP4-junction region-C-E3-E2-6k-E1-poly(A)-3\u2032 [3]. CHIKV virions have a spherical capsid with icosahedral symmetry surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope (about 70 nm in diameter) derived from the host cell membrane during virus budding. Two viral glycoproteins embedded in the envelope, E2 and E1, direct the attachment to the host cell membrane and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane, respectively [4], [5]. CHIKV is transmitted between human hosts by blood-feeding female mosquitoes of the Aedes species, particularly Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, often resulting in a clinical condition known as chikungunya fever (CHIKF) [6], [7]. Clinical symptoms of CHIKV infection are similar to that of other arthrogenic alphaviruses like Sindbis virus (SINV), Mayaro virus (MAYV) O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and Ross River virus (RRV), with arthralgia being the hallmark feature [8].",

Several imported cases of CHIKF have also been reported in Europe [10]. The occurrence of chikungunya epidemics has been unpredictable, with several outbreaks occurring at irregular intervals in Africa and Asia between 1960 and 1980 [11]. Following nearly 2 decades of relative quiescence, CHIKV has re-emerged in the last decade, causing major outbreaks in West Africa and among the islands in the Indian Ocean like Madagascar, Comoro, Mayonette and La R\u00e9union. At the same time, CHIKV became entrenched in India and Southeast Asia [12]\u2013[14]. Imported CHIKV cases have reached as far as Japan, China, Taiwan, parts of Europe and the United States of America [15]. As of 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have listed 46 countries affected by CHIKV (see http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/map/index.html). The re-emergence of CHIKV has become a major health concern, making it one of the medically important mosquito-borne viruses of the 21st century [16].",

In some cases, it is followed by chronic pain characterized by persistent arthralgia that can last from weeks to years [18], [19]. The acute symptoms have some similarities with classical dengue, often resulting in misdiagnosis of chikungunya cases in dengue endemic areas in the absence of laboratory confirmation. However, the two can be differentiated since CHIKV infection is more commonly associated with prolonged arthralgia affecting multiple joints, while classical and severe dengue manifest hemorrhagic symptoms [20]. CHIKV infection is generally none life-threatening. Nevertheless, the epidemic in La R\u00e9union that resulted in 265,000 CHIKF cases (roughly one-third of the population) with at least 237 CHIKV-related deaths, and recent reports of more severe clinical manifestation [21], [22] suggest the need to better understand the biology and clinical implications of CHIKV infection. In addition, the global expansion and increased health risks associated with CHIKV infections has prompted the demand for more aggressive efforts to find preventive and therapeutic interventions against this particular disease.",

One study reported a focus screen of 356 natural compounds and clinically approved drugs using a CHIKV replicon and a concomitant screen with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) surrogate infection model [29], while another study screened 3,040 small molecules for inhibitors of CHIKV nsP2 using a novel target-based phenotypic assay approach [30].",

By using high-throughput assays, a large collection of substances, from small molecules to natural products, can be evaluated for antiviral activity in a relatively short amount of time [31]. The work reported here describes the development of a simple, cell-based high-throughput assay to screen potential CHIKV antivirals. The assay uses resazurin, an oxidized, non-fluorescent blue dye that is converted to the reduced, and highly fluorescent pink-colored resorufin through oxidation-reduction reaction, to measure cellular metabolic activity and cell viability [32], [33]. Using this resazurin reduction assay, a small subset of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library was screened for compounds that could inhibit CHIKV-associated cell death in vitro then confirmed their activities by dose-response curves, virus yield reduction and microneutralization assays. The antiviral activity of the hit compounds was further analyzed using an innovative image-based high content assay to understand the underlying mechanism of action. In addition, the inhibitory properties of the CHIKV primary hits against dengue serotype 2 (DENV2) in a high-content assay screening of the same compound library previously reported [34] was investigated to determine if there are common novel inhibitors between these two unrelated arboviruses.",

The latter provides a tool to manipulate and analyze high-content screening data. Within this framework the plugin developed can be used to analyze single or multiple images from well-plate readouts. CHIKV high-content assay analysis is based on image acquired by measuring two different channels: DAPI-stained nuclei and GFP-expressing cells signals emitted at 450 nm and 540 nm, respectively. The cell number was quantified in the DAPI image using a watershed segmentation method [38]. If image is a landscape of peaks and basins, altitude being pixel intensity, then watershed is the flooding of basins with liquid which altitude is progressively increased on the whole image starting from image minima. Each time a local minima is reached a liquid with a new color appears. When 2 liquids meet they do not mix and form a boundary. This flooding process is terminated using a threshold that prevents inclusion of the background in the colored region. Before applying the watershed, unwanted minima due to image noise are filtered out by image blurring. Since nuclei in the DAPI Images are peaks rather than basins, the process is applied to the inverted image. Finally the output is an image where each nuclei region is identified by a unique color. The cell is the number of such defined regions. CHIKV-infected cells were identified by analyzing the degree of overlap between positive GFP signal, selected with a manually defined threshold, and individual nuclei. A cell is considered infected if at least half of its nucleus overlaps with the positive GFP signal. This criterion minimizes false detection due to noise in the GFP signal selection. The percentage of CHIKV-infected cells is defined as the ratio between the detected nuclei overlapping with the positive GFP signal and the total number of detected nuclei.",

            "text": "We developed a cell-based high-throughput assay system using the hepatocarcinoma HuH-7 cell line and resazurin to assess CHIKV-associated cell death. HuH-7 was selected as the target cells based on previous reports demonstrating its high susceptibility to CHIKV infection [43], [44]. Cell viability was determined by measuring the reduction of resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin by metabolically active and viable cells [33]. Using an initial seeding density for HuH-7 at 5\u00d7103 cells per well, the effect of CHIKV-118-GFP infection (M.O.I. of 0.5) on cell number and cell viability was measured at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs post-infection (hpi), with 50 \u00b5M CPZ as a control cytotoxic compound. Cell number was quantified by staining the nuclei with DAPI and analyzed using a customized plug-in of the Image Mining platform while cell viability was measured by resazurin reduction assay. Figure 1A and 1B show the number of detected nuclei at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi. CHIKV-118-GFP infection of HuH-7 cells started showing significant reduction in cell number beginning from 48 hpi compared with MOCK-infection (P<0.0001). The percent reduction in the average number of cells resulting from CHIKV-118-GFP infection was 65%, 90%, and 95% at 48, 72, and 96 hpi, respectively. In comparison, treatment with 50 \u00b5M CPZ dramatically reduced the cell number by 86% after 24 hrs, and >99.9% after 48, 72, and 96 hrs. Based on the resazurin reduction assay, CHIKV-infected and CPZ-treated HuH-7 cells showed significant reduction in cell viability after 72 hpi, as shown by their lower fluorescence readout (Figure 1C). Treatment of HuH-7 cells with 50 \u00b5M CPZ resulted in a measured fluorescence readout (240,842\u00b114,730 RFU) that was nearly identical with EMPTY wells (227,447\u00b12,446 RFU), suggesting complete abolition of metabolic activity. In comparison, CHIKV-infected HuH-7 showed higher fluorescence readout (398,579\u00b113,294 RFU), but was still significantly lower than that of MOCK-infected HuH-7 (801,587\u00b122,230 RFU). It has been reported previously that short-term resazurin reduction occurs in dying cells caused by the production of free and unpaired electrons [45] While a good fluorescent signal can be achieved from MOCK-infected cells, distinguishable from that of CPZ-treated cells and EMPTY wells, within 6 hours after treatment with resazurin, the 12-hour treatment was necessary to have a clear separation of fluorescent signals between MOCK-infected and CHIKV-infected cells (data not shown).",

Figure 2A shows the scatter-plot distribution of the percent inhibition for the 0.5% DMSO vehicle, 5 \u00b5M MPA and MOCK-infected groups. The average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and 5 \u00b5M MPA-treated groups in the 15 384-well test plates was 0.578\u00b10.075 (Z'-factors ranged from 0.460 to 0.703) while the average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and MOCK-infected groups was 0.645\u00b10.059 (Z' factors ranged from 0.544 to 0.724). The RFU of the 0.5% DMSO vehicle negative control group showed a higher degree of variability (CV = 13.9\u00b13.3%) compared with those of the positive control groups \u22125 \u00b5M MPA-treated (CV = 8.1\u00b11.6%) and MOCK-infected (CV = 5.1\u00b11.3%). While the 0.5% DMSO vehicle control group showed a CV slightly higher than 10%, the Z'-factors between the MOCK-infected and 0.5% DMSO vehicle control groups were >0.5 in all 15 test plates, indicating a reasonable separation between positive and negative controls. These findings demonstrate the reliability of the resazurin reduction assay for use in the CHIKV high-throughput screening. Figure 2B shows the activity and toxicity of 3 reference compounds (bafilomycin A1, chloroquine and mycophenolic acid) against CHIKV infection in HuH-7. BAF showed an EC50 value of 56 nM. Since BAF did not exhibit >50% toxicity at the highest concentration tested (200 nM), a projected CC50 value 237 nM was extrapolated based on the trend of the percent viability curve. For CQ, the EC50 and CC50 values were determined at 29 \u00b5M and 90 \u00b5M, respectively. A bell-shaped curve was observed for the percent inhibition as the concentration of CQ approached 100 \u00b5M and coincided with the steep decline in percent viability, indicating high toxicity at 100 \u00b5M. MPA showed an EC50 value of 1.6 \u00b5M, with no observable cytotoxicity at the highest concentration tested (100 \u00b5M). The antiviral activity of MPA determined by the resazurin reduction assay was within the range of the 50% inhibitory concentration of MPA previously reported (1.5 \u00b5M\u20134.1 \u00b5M) [29], while the measured antiviral activity and toxicity of BAF and CQ were within 3-fold of the observed inhibitory property from previously published reports [46], [47]. Interestingly, MPA treatment of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells at concentrations \u22653.25 \u00b5M resulted in higher fluorescence readout compared with non-infected HuH-7 treated with the same amount of the compound. The underlying mechanism for this observed phenomenon has not been elucidated.",

Figures 3A shows the overview of the results of the CHIKV high-throughput assay screening of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library, with the percent viability of each treatment represented by colored dots. A histogram of the percent viability showing the frequency distribution for each treatment (BioFocus compounds, CPZ, DMSO and MOCK) is shown in Figure 3B. The average percent viability of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells treated with 0.5% DMSO vehicle from plate to plate ranges between 33.99%\u00b17.51% and 38.36%\u00b17.39%. Using the upper limit of this range, the computed statistical cut-off (\u03bc+4\u03c3) was 67.92% viability. Based on this computed value, statistical cut-off was rounded off to 70% viability.

Among these, 6 hit compounds (CND0335, CND0364, CND0366, CND0415, CND0545 and CND3514) inhibited CHIKV-associated cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S3).

None of the confirmed hits exhibited significant toxicity in HuH-7 cells at the highest concentration tested. Conversely, some showed an increase in viability at higher concentrations based on the resazurin reduction readout. A counter-screen to determine if the compounds can contribute to the increased readout was carried out by mixing the compounds with resazurin in the medium. As shown in the Table S1, there was no increase in the RFU readout by the compounds alone, thus ruling out the direct reaction of resazurin with these particular compounds.

The inhibitory properties of two reference compounds and the 6 confirmed hit compounds against CHIKV-118-GFP were evaluated by image analysis using the customized plug-in on the Image Mining platform (see Figure 6A). Chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that blocks viral entry by preventing pH dependent fusion [49], inhibited CHIKV-118-GFP infection by 75.6% at 50 \u00b5M. Mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of GMP synthesis that results in decreased synthesis of RNA and DNA [50], inhibited more than 92% of infection at 50 \u00b5M. In contrast to CQ and MPA, none of the 6 hit compounds exhibited significant inhibition of CHIKV-118-GFP infection in HuH-7. The benzofuran and thiazol-4-carboxamide compounds showed <10% inhibition at 20 \u00b5M, with the exception of CND0364 (19.7% inhibition at 20 \u00b5M). Also, the pyrrolopyridine compound CND0545 only inhibited 28.3% of infection at 20 \u00b5M. However, it was observed that in the presence of the 6 hit compounds, the morphology of CHIKV-infected cells showed less apoptotic blebs compared with those treated with the DMSO vehicle control. Furthermore, the culture supernatant of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells showed a 10- to 100-folds decrease (1.16\u20132.01 log titer reduction) in viral titer when treated with the hit compounds compared to the DMSO vehicle control (Figure 6B). Interestingly, the reduction in viral titers resulting from the treatment of 6 hit compounds was comparable with that of chloroquine treatment (1.88 log titer reduction). Compounds CND0364 and CND0545, which exhibited the highest reduction in viral titers (1.69 log and 2.01 log titer reduction, respectively), inhibited the clearing of the cell monolayer caused by CHIKV-induced CPE at 12.5 \u00b5M and 25 \u00b5M, respectively in the microneutralization assay (Figure 7).",

            "text": "In recent years, the number and distribution of CHIKV cases have dramatically increased, culminating in the most devastating outbreak recorded between 2005\u20132006 in La R\u00e9union [14], [22]. The rising incidence of chikungunya outbreaks has spurned renewed efforts to find an effective vaccine to address this potential emerging epidemic [51]. Ironically, very few studies focusing on CHIKV antiviral drugs have been reported until recently. The use of chloroquine, a quinolone-containing drug used as an antimalarial drug [52], for therapeutic intervention of CHIKV-associated arthralgia was previously suggested [53]. While chloroquine showed inhibitory properties against CHIKV infection in vitro, it has a narrow selectivity index in cell cultures [46]. Furthermore, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial for treatment of acute chikungunya infections in La R\u00e9union with chloriquine did not show any significant benefits in the use of this drug [54]. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue prodrug that has been widely used as an antiviral for several DNA and RNA viruses [55], was also proposed as a therapeutic drug to treat chikungunya-associated arthritis [28]. However, no further follow-up studies were pursued. Another antiviral drug originally used for treatment of influenza and other respiratory viruses - arbidol - was also reported to have potent antiviral properties against CHIKV in vitro, and was found to bind to the E2 domain of the viral envelope protein and interfere with viral attachment on host cell receptor [27]. Recently, a bioactivity screening method to identify inhibitors of alphavirus entry and replication was reported [29]. The assays performed in this particular screening involved the use of a non-cytotoxic CHIKV replicon expressing EGFP and Rluc and a SFV surrogate model. The study reported several active 5,7-dihydroxyflavones (e.g. apigenin, chrysin, naringenin and silybin) from a collection of natural products that suppresses CHIKV and SFV replication, suggesting these molecules may be good antiviral candidates against alphavirus infections. Another cell-based phenotypic assay that identify inhibitors of CHIKV nsP2-mediated transcriptional shutoff was also recently reported [30].",

            "text": "Here we reported the development of a simple cell-based high-throughput assay using resazurin for the screening of bioactive molecules against CHIKV. Resazurin has been used mainly for detecting microbial contamination in milk and other food products for the past 70 years [56], [57]. However in the last 20 years, several resazurin-based assays have been developed for screening or evaluation of active molecules against microbial pathogens like Mycobacterium sp.\n[58], [59], Trichomonas vaginalis\n[60], Trypanosoma brucei\n[61], Leishmania sp.\n[36], Aspergillus fumigatus\n[62], as well as cancer [63], [64] and Clostridium perfringens \u03b5-toxin [65]. The resazurin reduction assay assesses cell viability by measuring the metabolic capacity of these cells to reduce resazurin (also known as Alamar blue) to the highly fluorescent resorufin. It has been shown that there is a positive linear correlation between metabolic reduction of resazurin and the number of viable cells [33], [66]. In viable eukaryotic cells, the conversion of resazurin to resorufin is facilitated by mitochondrial reductases and diaphorases such as dihydrolipoamine dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4,), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.2) and flavin reductase (EC 1.6.99.1) found in the mitochondria or cytoplasm [33], [67]. CHIKV causes highly cytopathic infection in a wide variety of cells of vertebrate origin, resulting in rapid death of infected cells by apoptosis [46]. Thus, the resazurin reduction assay was used to identify potential CHIKV inhibitors by measuring cell viability, which serves as an indicator of inhibitory property against CHIKV-associated cell death. Unlike the non-cytotoxic CHIKV replicon used for the bioactive screening, our CHIKV high-throughput assay uses an infectious recombinant CHIKV (CHIKV-118-GFP) that is highly cytopathic in HuH-7 cells. Screening the 4,000 compound subset of the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library using the resazurin reduction assay identified 6 active compounds that inhibit CHIKV-associated cell death \u2013 4 having a benzofuran core scaffold, 1 with a pyrrolopyridine scaffold, and 1 with a thiazol-carboxamide scaffold \u2013 with EC50 in the single-digit micromolar range. However, it was observed that the inhibitory properties of the active compounds at the highest concentration tested (50 \u00b5M) were not enough for the metabolic activity of the host cell infected with CHIKV to reach the same level as that of non-infected cells. Moreover, the percentage of CHIKV-infected cells in the image-based high-content assay of CHIKV-118-GFP infection did not diminish significantly even in the presence of 20 \u00b5M concentration of the active compounds, an indication that the their activity have little or no effect in the viral entry process or viral replication machinery. Interestingly, despite the high percentage of CHIKV-infected cells, treatment with 20 \u00b5M of the active compounds reduced viral titers up to 100-fold, suggesting that their activity likely targets the later stages of viral infection (i.e., virus assembly and release).",

            "text": "Several factors have been implicated in the persistence of arthralgia after CHIKV infection. After CHIKV replicates in the liver, it targets muscle satellite cells, as well as other cells and tissues like muscle, joint and fibroblasts [68], [69]. Persistence of CHIKV infection in microglial cells and perivascular synovial macrophages have been shown to trigger host-derived inflammatory cytokine responses that contribute directly to synovial tissue damage [70]\u2013[73]. Viral persistence has been attributed to the ability of the virus to evade the host immune response by different mechanisms. Recently, a novel mechanism of immune evasion by CHIKV involving the host cell's apoptotic machinery has been described. CHIKV particles have been shown to hide in apoptotic blebs of infected cells and invade neighboring cells or cells that are otherwise refractory to CHIKV alone, such as macrophages, through phagocytosis of these apoptotic bodies [6], [74]. The two active compounds that yielded the highest reduction in CHIKV viral titers (CND0364 and CND0545) were shown to inhibit CHIKV-induced CPE in the microneutralization assay. The phenotypic characteristic of CHIKV-118-GFP infected HuH-7 cells treated with the benzofuran compound CND0364 and pyrrolopyridine compound CND0545 showed a dramatic reduction in the formation of apoptotic blebs compared with the DMSO vehicle control treatment, as well as chloroquine treatment (Figure 8). These findings suggest that the benzofuran and pyrrolyridine compounds impede the efficient dissemination of CHIKV into the neighboring cells by interfering with the virus-induced apoptotic machinery.",

            "text": "The exact role of cellular kinases in promoting CHIKV-induced apoptosis remains poorly understood. It has been reported that CHIKV dsRNA activates dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). PKR phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2\u03b1) and plays a role, albeit not essential, in CHIKV-associated cellular translational shutoff [75]. Ironically, it has been shown recently that CHIKV nsP4 suppresses eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation that regulates the PKR-like ER resident kinase (PERK) pathway [76], an ER stress pathway implicated in mediating cell apoptosis [77]. CHIKV has also been reported to trigger an autophagic process that promotes viral replication [78]. However, CHIKV-induced autophagy delays caspase-dependent cell death and regulates viral spread [79]. Kinases like vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) complex and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) are involved in up- or down-regulating autophagy [80].",

In addition, since CHIKV displays a wide tropism in cell culture. It will be of interest to determine the antiviral activity of these compounds in other relevant cell lines and primary cells that are natural targets of the virus [46], [81]. In summary, the work present here describes the application of a cell-based high-throughput assay system using resazurin and an image-based high content assay approach to screen a kinase-focused chemical library for potential inhibitors of CHIKV. With these two assays, compounds that interfere with CHIKV-induced CPE, which have been shown to play a role in the efficient dissemination of the virus, were identified. The six active compounds identified here could be used to further investigate the mechanisms involved in CHIKV-induced CPE, as well as serve as a starting point for the development of new antiviral drug candidates for CHIKV. Moreover, the cell-based high throughput assay using resazurin and image-based high-content assay systems described here could be applied in the screening other compound libraries for potential CHIKV inhibitors.",
