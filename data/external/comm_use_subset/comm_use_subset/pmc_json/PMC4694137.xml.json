            "text": "Amino sugars are referred to a variety of diversified/complex monosaccharides in which a hydroxyl group is chemically replaced with the amine group. Most of current knowledge on the metabolism of amino sugars comes from studies with Escherichia coli (Reizer et al. 1996), Bacillus subtilis (Freymond et al. 2006; Gaugue et al. 2014; Plumbridge 2015) and Streptomycetes coelicolor (Rigali et al. 2008). Relative to the best\u2010known examples of amino sugars, glucosamine (GlcN) and N\u2010acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the investigations on the other two amino sugar derivatives of galactose, N\u2010acetyl\u2010d\u2010galactosamine (GalNAc) and d\u2010galactosamine (GalN), are relatively limited, but increasingly accumulated (Abu\u2010Qarn et al. 2008; Leyn et al. 2012). It seemed very likely that GalN/GalNAc amino sugars as common components participate in the formation of various cell structures/constitutes in three domains of life (Abu\u2010Qarn et al. 2008; Plumbridge 2015). In general, not only does GalNAc act as an element of lipopolysaccharide displayed on bacterial cell wall (Bernatchez et al. 2005; Leyn et al. 2012), and but also connects carbohydrate chains in mammalian mucins (Carraway and Hull 1991). Additionally, it functions as the substrate in N\u2010acetyl \u03b2\u2010galactosidation, a new type of post\u2010translational modification of protein in organisms, including bacterial pathogens (Sadler et al. 1979; Barr and Nordin 1980; Davis et al. 1986; Abu\u2010Qarn et al. 2008). Given the multiple roles played by GalN/GalNAc, we therefore anticipated a hypothesis that GalN/GalNAc metabolism might be linked to bacterial infectivity.",

            "text": "The paradigm pathway for GalN/GalNAc utilization/catabolism, which was initially proposed for E. coli in 1996 (Reizer et al. 1996), contained the following five steps (Fig. 1): (1) the transport and phosphorylation of GalN/GalNAc substrates (catalyzed by phosphortransferase system [PTS] systems AgaBCD and AgaVWEF, respectively) (Brinkkotter et al. 2000), (2) the AgaA\u2010mediated deacetylation of GalNAc\u20106\u2010P (Reizer et al. 1996), (3) the deamination/isomerization of GalN\u20106\u2010P by the bi\u2010functional enzyme AgaS into Tag\u20106\u2010P (Reizer et al. 1996), (4) the AgaZ kinase\u2010aided phosphorylation of Tag\u20101,6\u2010P from Tag\u20106\u2010P (Reizer et al. 1996), and (5) cleavage of Tag\u20101,6\u2010PP by the class II aldolase, AgaY (Brinkkotter et al. 2002), to produce glyceraldehyde 3\u2010phospahte and glycerone phosphate (PEP). Interestingly, a recent comparative genomics\u2010based study suggested an extensive diversity in GalN/GalNAc utilization pathways of Proteobacteria such as Shewanella (Leyn et al. 2012). In particular note the first two steps of this pathway exhibit of high variability, while the latter three steps are largely conserved (Leyn et al. 2012). In E. coli, not only does AgaR regulator that belongs to the DeoR family of transcriptional factors, act as an autoregulator, but also negatively controls the expression of two aga genes (agaZ and agaS) of GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway via direct binding of the specific palindromes in front of these target genes (Ray and Larson 2004). Although the fact that both GalN and GalNAc can induce activities of these aga genes\u2010encoding protein products is aware, the physiological ligands for AgaR repressor remain unclear (Leyn et al. 2012).",

According to the differentiation in their bacterial capsule structure, this Streptococcus species is categorized into 35 serotypes (Feng et al. 2010, 2014b). Among them, serotype 2 (SS2) is generally believed to be most virulent, in that it is frequently isolated from clinical diseased swine (Ma et al. 2009; Feng et al. 2014b) and human sporadic cases (Feng et al. 2009b) and/or big\u2010scale outbreaks (Tang et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2007). We are aware that SS2 has spread to more than 30 countries/regions and claims nearly 1600 cases of human infections worldwide (Feng et al. 2014b). The molecular mechanism underlying bacterial pathogenicity has been partially delineated thus far (Feng et al. 2014b), and these identified virulence determinants include the previously\u2010known virulence factors exemplified with capsule (Benga et al. 2008; Seitz et al. 2014) and suilysin (Jacobs et al. 1996; Lun et al. 2003; Takeuchi et al. 2014). In addition to the regulatory networks amongst the newly identified factors (e.g., the two\u2010component systems SalK/SalR [Li et al. 2008], NisK/NisR [Xu et al. 2014], CiaRH [Li et al. 2011], etc.), it would be of particular interest to note the contributions of enzymes from central metabolisms (enolase [Eno] [Esgleas et al. 2008; Feng et al. 2009a; Zhang et al. 2009a; Lu et al. 2012], glutamine synthase [GlnA] [Si et al. 2009], Inosine 5\u2010monophosphate dehydrogenase [Impdh] [Zhang et al. 2009b; Zhou et al. 2014], etc.) to bacterial pathogenesis (Feng et al. 2014b).

More intriguingly, we observed that AgaR2\u2010dependent regulation of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway is required for bacterial virulence of S. suis serotype 2.

Briefly, the SpcR cassette from pSET2 (Takamatsu et al. 2001) was cloned into the pUC19 vector (Invitrogen) to give the intermediate plasmid pUC19\u2010Spc (Table S1), and then the two DNA fragments adjacent to the agaR2 (or agaR1) gene were separately inserted into the pUC19\u2010Spc vector, giving the knockout plasmid pUC::447 and pUC::448, respectively (Table S1).

The approach includes inference of transcriptional factor\u2010binding sites (TFBSs), construction of nucleotide positional weight matrices (PWMs) for TFBSs motifs, and reconstruction of regulons in complete genomes on the basis of prediction of putative TFBSs in the promoter gene regions. First, in the studied Lactobacillales genomes, we revealed orthologs of previously known genes for GalNAc utilization (Table S3). Second, we predicted possible transcriptional regulators for the uncovered GalNAc utilization. Candidate regulators were attributed to the regulons by using a genomic colocalization and co\u2010occurence of a putative regulator with the identified GalNAc utilization genes. Such analysis defined two groups of transcriptional regulators belonging to the HutC subfamily of the GntR family (Fig. 7). For each group of AgaR proteins, we identified putative binding motifs analyzing upstream regions of presumably regulated gene by the Discover Profile tool implemented in the RegPredict Web server (Novichkov et al. 2010). In this approach, putative TFBSs were determined as overrepresented words in upstream regions of putatively co\u2010regulated genes. Based on the genomic co\u2010occurrence and co\u2010presence of genes, it has been proposed that AgaR1\u2010binding sites should be located upstream hydrolase and PTS genes while AgaR2 sites ought to be upstream of deacetylase, isomerase, and aldolase genes. For the prediction of putative TFBSs, we analyzed upstream regions of probably related operons, expanding \u2212400 to +100 bp relative to start codon of the first gene of the operon. Both AgaR1 and AgaR2 belong to HutC subfamily. TFBSs for HutC subfamily proteins have structure of an even palindrome (Rigali et al. 2002; Suvorova et al. 2015). Thus, for prediction of the AgaR1 and AgaR2 TFBSs motifs, we searched for even palindromic DNA motifs of 14\u201324 bp. Among all motifs found for each set of upstream regions, we selected the longest motif with the highest information content. The selected motif was quality controlled by two approaches, (1) consistency check and (2) phylogenetic footprinting. Consistency check (Mironov et al. 1999; Rodionov 2007) was done, that is, motif was checked for the presence in multiple number of genomes. High quality motif should find predicted TFBSs in upstream regions of predicted regulated operons in genomes having the analyzed regulator, but not in genomes lacking the regulator. Phylogenetic footprinting technique is based on analysis of multiple alignments for upstream regions of orthologous genes (Shelton et al. 1997). High quality motif should find predicted TFBSs that are located inside conserved islands of multiple alignments. When the high quality of the motif was confirmed by both consistency check and phylogenetic footprinting, the identified regulatory motifs were used for the construction of the PWMs (profiles) and the obtained matrices were used to determine additional candidate regulatory sites in the analyzed genomes, using the Run Profile tool in the RegPredict Web server. The scores of sites were calculates as a sum of nucleotide weights for each position.",

ANA\u20103 (Leyn et al. 2012). Here we used the same approach for reconstruction of the GalNAc utilization pathway in the zoonotic agent, S. suis (Fig. 1 and Table S1). For integrated genomic reconstruction of GalNAc utilization pathways and concordant transcriptional regulation, we searched orthologs of known GalNAc utilization genes (Leyn et al. 2012) in complete Lactobacillales genomes. As a result, the genes encoding, this metabolic pathway was identified in 16 genomes representing four families, Streptococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteraceae, and Carnobacteriaceae (Table S1). The minimal number of genes in the reconstructed regulons was detected in Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In these organisms, only one or two genes from the GalNAc utilization pathway were found because these genes were insufficient for GalNAc utilization. Most probably, these organisms cannot utilize GalNAc. The minimal gene set allowing utilization of GalNAc is present in a group of closely related genomes including Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus pneumonia. This gene set contains genes for regulator (agaR), galactosamine\u20106\u2010phosphate deaminase/isomerase (agaS), glycoside hydrolase (bgaC), and PTS (gadVWEF). The other well\u2010studied Streptococcus genomes also contain genes for the tagatose\u20101,6\u2010diphosphate aldolase (agaY). In contrast, all the analyzed Lactobacillus lack agaY gene but contain the gene for N\u2010acetylgalactosamine\u2010phosphate deacetylase (agaA). Amongst Streptococcaceae, agaA gene was identified only in the S. suis genome.

Thus, organisms lacking agaA gene should have GalN\u2010specific transporters whereas organism having agaA gene should be able to transport GalNAc (Leyn et al. 2012). To predict the specificity of the Lactobacillaceae transport systems, we compared all the identified PTSs to the previously described ones. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the Lactobacillaceae PTSs are orthologous to the transport system from Haemophilus parasuis (Fig. S4). This PTS was previously proposed to be specific to GalN\u2010containing oligosaccharides. Co\u2010occurrence and co\u2010localization of this PTS with the hydrolase genes in the most studied genomes confirms its specificity to the oligosaccharides. On the other hand, PTS genes are co\u2010localized also with the agaA gene in the large number of studied genomes (Table S3) that designate to the possibility of this system to transport GalNAc or both GalNAc and GalN containing oligomers.

Predicted AgaR1\u2010binding sites have a length 20 bp, whereas the predicted\u2010binding sites for AgaR2 are 18 bp sequences (Fig. 5A and Table S4). Both AgaR1 and AgaR2\u2010binding motifs have a palindrome AT\u2010rich central part. The AgaR1\u2010binding motif is AT\u2010rich at all times and quite degenerated, that is, has moderate information content. On the other hand, the AgaR2\u2010binding motif is more CG\u2010rich and conserved and has a higher information content than AgaR1\u2010binding motif. Additionally, AgaR2\u2010binding motif demonstrate similarities with the motifs of some regulators, previously characterized experimentally or in silico, such as GnbR of Lactobacillus casei BL23 (Bidart et al. 2014) and NagR proteins of B. subtilis (Bertram et al. 2011; Leyn et al. 2013) and various Lactoacillales (Ravcheev et al. 2013).

Thereby, we employed EMSA to probe the binding of the AgaR2 (and/or AgaR1) protein to the cognate palindromes (Table S4, Fig. 5A and B). On the S. suis chromosome, totally three putative AgaR2\u2010binding sites (SSU05_0195 probe, SSU05_1259 probe and SSU05_0448/9 site 2 probe) were localized, whereas only one possible AgaR1\u2010recognizable site (SSU05_0448/9 site 1 probe) was detected. Because of the absence of the predicted AgaR2\u2010binding site upstream of the agaR2 gene, we expected that this gene is not autoregulated. Indeed, EMSA experiments suggested that AgaR2 protein cannot bind to its own promoter region (SSU05_0447 probe), ruling out the possibility of autoregulation by AgaR2 regulator (Fig. 5C). By contrast, EMSA tests revealed clearly that AgaR2 protein bound the other three AgaR2\u2010binding palindromes in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig. 5D\u2013F). Additionally, we also used S. suis AgaR2 protein to evaluate the function of the two AgaR\u2010binding sites in front of the EF1809 locus of E. faecalis V583, a close relative of S. suis. As a result, AgaR2 physically interacted with the EF1809 site 2, TTGTGGTTATAACCAGTT (Fig. 5H), but not the EF1809 site 1, TTTATTGACAAAATAAAAAA (Fig. 5G) further validated the specificity of AgaR2 binding.",

The \u0394agaR2 (\u0394447) isogenic mutant was constructed, using an approach of homologous recombination, and its complementary strain C\u0394agaR2 (C\u0394447) was generated through the low\u2010copy plasmid pVA838\u2010borne expression of agaR2 gene (Table S1). We noted that the deletion of agaR2 does not affect its growth (Fig. S1A). Additionally, no obvious alteration of capsule was observed in the \u0394 agaR2 mutant in comparison with the WT strain 05ZYH33 (Fig. S1B and C). The qPCR\u2010based transcriptional analyses showed that removal of agaR2 gene gave at least five\u2010fold increment of agaS (agaAY and bgaC\u2010gadVWEF operon) expression (Fig. 6B). Whereas the transcription of the above target genes was restored to the level seen in its parental strain S. suis 05ZYH33 (Fig. 6B). Similar results were also observed in altered expression profile of the \u0394agaR2 mutant revealed by the RNA\u2010Seq (e.g., expression of the three genes SSU05_0195 (agaS), SSU05_1259 (agaA), and SSU05_1258 (agaY) are elevated upon removal of agaR2, Table 1). Therefore, it seemed true that AgaR2 is a functional repressor for the Streptococcus GalNAc utilization pathway. In contrast, we failed to visualize any significant alteration of the bgaC (SSU05_0448) expression level in the \u0394agaR1 mutant in comparison with the WT strain and its complementary strain CagaR1 (not shown). The suggested possibility that agaR1 might play an uncovered role or be an evolutional relic with loss of physiological demand and/or advantage, in that (1) there is no in vivo regulatory role attributed to its protein product AgaR1 although it retains DNA\u2010binding activity to its own promoter, (2) the fact that all the other GalNAc metabolism\u2010related genes are without control by AgaR1 is due to the lack of the predicted AgaR1\u2010recognizable palindromes, (3) no physiological function can be present in GalNAc metabolism, even AgaR1 can autoregulate itself.

Thereby, we anticipated that the enhancement in abilities of bacterial attachment and anti\u2010phagocytosis might be partially due to the altered carbohydrates with GalN/GalNAc residues on bacterial cell wall surface and this kind of alteration could be attributed to the dysfunction in AgaR2\u2010mediated regulation of GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway.

In the mice infection assays, all the 10 BALB/c (4\u2010week old, female) mice infected with the WT strain 05ZYH33 were sick shortly, and most of the rats died within 60 h (Fig. 7E).

To verify the results obtained from the above model of mice, we repeated the infection tests using the model of SPF\u2010piglets, natural hosts for S. suis. As a result, we observed that the six SPF\u2010piglets inoculated with WT virulent strain developed most of the typical disease symptoms (high fever, limping, swollen joints, etc.), and most of them died on day 1 (Fig. 7F). As expected, all the piglets infected with the \u0394agaR2 mutant survived during the period of entire experiment. However, the re\u2010introduction of agaR2 gene into the \u0394agaR2 mutant restored fully its strong virulence (Fig. 7F).

Different from the scenarios described in E. coli (Reizer et al. 1996) and Shewanella (Leyn et al. 2012), a significant variation of this pathway was proposed for Streptococci (Fig. 1 and Table S4). As you can see from the working model, AgaZ is absent in S. suis. It seemed likely that our continued genomic analyses pointed out that S. suis actually lacks any ortholog of this gene. Thereby, we speculated that the loss of AgaZ function in S. suis might be compensated by two other genes that are not in aga regulon: (1) SSU05_1041 (lacC2; tagatose 6\u2010phosphate kinase, EC 2.7.1.144), (2) SSU05_0543 (pfk, 6\u2010phosphofructokinase, EC 2.7.1.11). This hypothesis required further experimental verification.",

            "text": "Through extensive analyses for genomic contexts from Firmicutes, we dissected two GalN/GalNAc pathway\u2010specific regulators namely AgaR2 and AgaR1. The agaR1 gene is divergently transcribed into genes forming an operon and encoding a \u03b2\u2010galactosidase (BgaC) (Hu et al. 2014) and a PTS sugar uptake system (named agaBCDE that could be a GalN uptake system). The agaR2 gene in many Streptococcus species is located in front of the genes encoding the predicted galactosamine\u20106\u2010phosphate isomerase and Tagatose 1,6\u2010diphosphate aldolase, two key enzymes in the AGA catablic pathway. In S. suis, the locus SSU05_0448 is annotated to be agaR1, whereas SSU05_0447 is referred to agaR2. Somewhat evolutionally distinct from the paradigm regulator (the E. coli agaR protein product) that belongs to the DeoR family of transcription factor, the two newly identified regulators AgaR2 and AgaR1 are classified into the GntR family of transcription repressors (Figs. 3, S1). Additionally, it seemed likely that the two GntR\u2010like regulators (AgaR2 and AgaR1) themselves fit into two different subgroups and might possess the varied preference in their DNA\u2010binding sites (Figs. 3, S4). The fact that AgaR2\u2010recognizable palindrome is predicted to be present in front of multiple target genes whereas AgaR1 has only one site located in its own promoter region (Fig. 2) raised the possibility that AgaR2 could have been evolved into a prevalent/major regulator for GalN/GalNAc utilization pathway (AgaR1 might be a minor/and even a cryptic regulator). Our in vitro gel shift assays validated the direct interaction between the AgaR2 (and/or AgaR1) protein and its binding sites (Figs. 5, S3). Given the facts that a significant regulated expression of GalN/GalNAc utilization\u2010related genes (such as agaS, agaAY , and bgaC) by AgaR2 was observed, however, no in vivo role could be attributed to AgaR1, we came to be more confident that AgaR2 relative to AgaR1 acts as a prevalent/leading player in modulating expression of genes encoding bacterial GalN/GalNAc catabolism in most Firmicutes. However, we did not obtain evidence for physiological ligand/molecular effector of AgaR2 repressor, although we observed that GalNAc does induce the expression of GalN/GalNAc catabolism\u2010related genes such as agaS (Fig. 6C).",

As expected, an interference of GalN/GalNAc catabolism/utilization by disrupting agaR2 encoding a prevalent regulator, significantly altered abilities of both bacterial adherence to Hep\u20102 cells and anti\u2010phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage (Fig. 7). Given the fact that in this alteration we observed a similar scenario seen with the two virulence\u2010associated determinants (neuB and cps2B) with biological roles in constitution/development of bacterial surface architecture (Feng et al. 2012), we reasoned that regulation/maintenance of GalN/GalNAc catabolism pathway is essential for full virulence of S. suis. In fact, this proposal was subsequently proved in that the dysfunction in AgaR2\u2010mediated regulation impairs bacterial infectivity of S. suis in both mice and piglets (Fig. 7). Also, we are not surprised to establish the relevance of GalN/GalNAc catabolism to bacterial pathogenicity, in that the alteration of carbohydrates with GalN/GalNAc residues on bacterial cell surface interferes with the bacterial pathogen\u2010binding host cells.",
