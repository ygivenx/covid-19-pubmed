Each year, between 3 and 5 million severe cases and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths due to seasonal influenza are reported worldwide [1], [2]. Cyclic pandemics due to antigenic shifts constitute an important threat [3] as was demonstrated by the swine-origin pandemic of 2009 [4]. Since vaccines for novel influenza virus strains require approximately 6 months to develop and produce [5], antivirals remain the first line of defense. There are only two classes of antivirals approved for treatment of influenza [6]. The adamantanes, such as amantadine and rimantadine, are ineffective against B-type viruses [7] and have recently become ineffective against most A/H3N2 and some A/H1N1 viruses due to a mutation in the M2 gene [8]. The neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI), which include zanamivir and oseltamivir, were approved a decade ago and have shown excellent activity against all influenza A subtypes and B viruses [9]. A recent rapid increase in resistance to oseltamivir, however, has become a cause for concern.",

With a location on the framework residue of the enzyme catalytic site [12], the mutation has been shown to cause a reduced affinity for the substrate in enzyme activity assays [12], [13], an impaired viral fitness in vitro [14]\u2013[16], and up to a 100-fold reduction in transmission efficiency in ferrets [14], [17]. For these reasons, strains carrying the H275Y mutation were not thought to be a great concern for public health [10], [18]. During the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, however, the A/Brisbane/59/2007-like (H1N1) H275Y mutant emerged and rapidly disseminated worldwide in the apparent absence of antiviral pressure [8], [19]\u2013[21]. Recently, our group performed a study on the replicative capacities of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y mutant strain where we showed that its fitness, based on in vitro and animal studies, was similar to that of its wild-type (WT), oseltamivir-susceptible, counterpart [22]. These observations, and those of others [23], correlate with the clinical situation encountered in the 2008\u20132009 season where almost 100% of the A/H1N1 viruses isolated in North America and Europe were resistant to oseltamivir due to the H275Y mutation [1], [19], [23].",

Specifically, the reduction of NA activity conferred by the H275Y mutation has been associated with a reduced expression of surface neuraminidase, possibly due to defects in the folding of the molecule or its transport through the cellular membrane [24]. It has been shown, however, that two other mutations in the NA gene (V234M and R222Q) can provide a compensatory effect by increasing NA surface expression, and that these two substitutions indeed occurred in the evolution of the H1N1 seasonal strain between 1999 and 2007 [24]. The neuraminidase of contemporary (A/Brisbane/59/2007-like) strains susceptible to oseltamivir have shown a higher affinity for the substrate in NA activity assays than older H1N1 seasonal strains (e.g., A/New Caledonia/20/99 and A/Solomon Islands/3/06); contemporary oseltamivir-resistant strains (with the H275Y substitution) have shown a decrease in that affinity, but remain above the level of older strains [25]. Thus, it seems that these pre-existing mutations led to an over-expression of NA and provided a favorable environment for the appearance of the H275Y mutation. The eventual dominance of the H275Y mutant may be due to a better balance between the hemagglutinin (HA) and NA activity [25], [26]. It remains an open question, however, precisely how these mechanistic changes lead to viral fitness changes. The answer to this should be found in the details of the infection kinetics in the interaction of virus and cell.",

Here, we show that it is possible to use these experimental measures to quantitatively characterize the kinetics parameters responsible for the replicative efficiency of influenza virus strains. As a proof of concept, we apply our method for extracting the viral kinetics parameters to the oseltamivir-susceptible/-resistant pair of A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza virus strains in order to determine how the known genotypic differences in these two strains map to quantitative changes in the viral kinetics parameters characterizing their replicative efficiency. The kinetics parameters extracted through our method suggest that the H275Y mutant has weaker NA activity compared to its WT counterpart \u2014 confirmed by NA activity assays \u2014 which manifests itself as a longer phase of latent infection before viral release \u2014 confirmed by single-cycle viral yield experiments. However, the results also indicate that this longer latent infection period for cells infected by the H275Y mutant is compensated for by a shorter infecting time required for that cell, once releasing virions, to successfully infect other cells.",

The plaque growth is characterized by an initial delay where no growth is observed, followed by a period of linear increase of the plaque radius over time. After 60 h, the rate of plaque growth declines and the linear approximation is no longer valid. The growth attenuation could be due to a number of factors including a hardening of the overlay, a depletion of nutrients required for viral production and cell maintenance, and the wide-spread destruction of the cell monolayer leading to holes and irregularities disrupting and limiting further growth.",

Plaque assays are often used for strain comparison and, in that context, plaque diameters at a single time point are reported. These plaque diameters are then typically used to conclude that, for example, if the plaques observed at 48 h for strain A are larger than those for strain B, then strain A must have a higher replicative fitness than strain B. However, one should question whether such conclusions are valid and robust to experimental variability. Looking at Figure 2, one can see that at 36 h, the plaque radius of both A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and its H275Y mutant counterpart are comparable in size. Yet at 60 h, the WT strain has significantly larger plaques than the H275Y mutant, and the situation is reversed at 96 h. Thus, relying on single time point measurements for comparing strains can be misleading.",

The plaque velocity, unlike the plaque radius at a given time point, is a robust measure in that it takes into account plaque radius at several time points and is not affected by differences in the length of the delay period which precedes the period of linear growth. Using this method, the measured plaque growth was more rapid for the WT than the H275Y mutant, with a plaque velocity of  compared to , where  is the diameter of one cell.

Target cells interacting with virus become latently infected at a constant infection rate per virus, . The average time a cell remains latently infected is called the latent infection period, , and the average time a cell releases virus is called the infectious lifespan, . Virus is produced by infectious cells at a constant viral production rate, , and this free virus loses infectivity exponentially at a constant rate of viral infectivity loss,  (as is observed in experiments [35]). In applying this model, it is assumed that the growth of a particular influenza virus strain in a particular cell line is determined by a single, unique set of values for these five parameters. Thus, although the mathematical structure of the models used for each experimental assay is different (see Materials and Methods for a detailed description of each), the parameter values for a particular virus strain are assumed to be constant from assay to assay. With only three experimentally measured quantities, it would be impossible to uniquely identify all five parameters for a particular virus strain. Fortunately, it is possible to reduce the number of parameters considered and obtain unique identification of a few key parameter values.",

Since prior in vitro experiments have shown that infectious cell death is nearly complete shortly after the viral titer peak [38], [39], we set the rate of viral infectivity loss, , equal to the viral titer decay rate. Because this decay rate was determined to be  for both A/Brisbane/59/2007 strains, we have fixed the rate of viral infectivity loss to this value for all simulations. This corresponds to a virion half life of approximately 3.6 h, which is consistent with prior measurements for influenza virus in the experimental literature (see, e.g., [35], [40]).

In the latter case, this parameter was explicitly neglected in the derivation of the growth rate, because earlier viral yield experiments have shown little cell death prior to the peak of the virus concentration (see, e.g., [38], [39]). The fact that, over a wide range of infectious lifespan values, the resulting plaque velocity remained unchanged, is perhaps more surprising. Indeed, a shorter infectious lifespan will lead to the earlier appearance of plaques, resulting in larger plaque sizes at any given time. We have shown, however, in earlier work where influenza virus plaques were observed by immunostaining [41], that the same plaque velocity can be measured from both the progress of dead cells, as we consider here, and the progress of newly infected cells. This indicates that plaque velocity is established at the advancing edge of an infection wave, and is likely unaffected by cell death in the wake of that wave. In those experiments, the infectious lifespan of a cell appears only as a time-delay between the infected cell plaque growth and the dead cell plaque growth. This has also been observed for the plaques of other viruses [42]. Since the infectious lifespan has little effect on the experiments we consider, and is therefore not identifiable here, we have fixed its value for both strains and for all simulations to value of , obtained from the literature (Table 1).",

Therefore, the observed virus production of the cell culture can be considered roughly proportional to that of an individual cell. The results of two independent experiments for each strain are shown in Figure 7A; one experiment shows the viral titer over one full day post-infection and the other over only 14 h but with more frequent sampling. For each replicate, the viral titer of each strain was observed to grow rapidly after 4 h post-infection, with the WT viral titer reaching a plateau at approximately 8 h post-infection and that of the H275Y mutant reaching a plateau between 10 h and 14 h post-infection. Although the viral titer data in each replicate followed a relatively smooth curve, the inter-replicate variation was quite large, with peak virus titer varying from  to almost . It is also notable that all of these peak values were well below the values seen in the multiple-cycle viral yield assay (Figure 3), by a factor of . Both of these features could be explained by the action of a relatively large defective interfering particle population [43], [44] within the viral stock, which is not uncommon for the influenza virus [45].",

Specifically, we have found that the latent infection period of the H275Y mutant strain \u2014 equal to the time elapsed between the successful infection of a cell by a virion and the significant release of virus progeny by the newly infected cell \u2014 is much longer than that of the WT strain (by 4\u201310 h). The infectivity of the mutant strain, however, was found to be much higher than the WT, as quantified by the infecting time \u2014 equal to the time for a single infectious cell to cause the latent infection of one other, within a completely susceptible cell population. Independent single-cycle viral yield assay results lend support to the hypothesis of a longer latent infection period for the mutant strain than the WT, but suggest a more moderate () difference between the two. These results are consistent with the larger NA activity of the susceptible (WT) strain compared to the H275Y mutant, reported here and by others [25], and its increased NA surface expression [24]. Since neuraminidase is the viral surface enzyme responsible for cleaving the virus from its sialic-acid receptors at the cell surface [47], it can be expected that an increase of its expression would lead to more rapid viral release (a shorter latent infection period for the WT strain) but may also hinder the subsequent attachment of virions to other cells, leading to decreased infectivity (longer infecting times).",

            "text": "The method presented here for the determination of the infection parameters differs from previous mathematical modeling approaches to viral dynamics in that we have considered the explicit dependence of two experimental quantities on the parameters, rather than fitting a full dynamical model to the time-course of an experiment. There are a number of benefits to this approach. First, we have been careful to determine that the two experimental quantities under consideration, plaque velocity and viral titer growth rate, depend on only two unknown infection parameters, the infecting time, , and the latent infection period, . This ensures that the problem of parameter extraction is theoretically solvable, which is often not the case when fitting a multi-parameter model to experimental data (see, e.g., [56]). Second, the experimental quantities themselves are robust and easily measurable in repeated experiments. The viral plaque is formed by the progression of an infection wave across the monolayer of cells [42] whose constant velocity is determined by the infection kinetics averaged over many thousands of cells. Therefore the measured plaque velocity depends on the average interaction of virus and cell, and is insensitive to stochastic effects on a small scale. Similarly, the viral titer growth rate is due to the collective infection of thousands of cells and is independent of the details of initial infection (i.e., the precise value of the multiplicity of infection) or the total number of cells in the system. Other quantities of in vitro experiments, such as the time and value of the viral peak in a yield experiment, are much more sensitive to experimental details. Finally, the method we have applied here is robust to changes in the construction of the mathematical model itself. We have, for example, performed the same analysis of the plaque and yield assays using a stochastic model with more general assumptions about the cell transitions from latently infected to infectious and found nearly identical results (not shown here).",

In particular, it would be useful to develop an experimental assay which could measure the infecting time for a given strain, in the same way that single-cycle viral yield experiments give an approximate measure for the latent infection period. It is also of interest to design a set of experiments which may be less expensive and laborious than those presented here, perhaps using fluorescent or photographic observations of cell cultures rather than virus titrations, and which can identify a fuller set of viral kinetics parameters. We are currently designing competition experiments for the A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and H275Y mutant strains in which the predictions which follow from the parameters extracted here can be tested directly. When verified, the basic method of analyzing parallel plaque and viral yield experiments introduced here should be useful in other contexts. For example, the investigation of other drug-resistant viruses (e.g., that of the pandemic A/H1N1), the rapid characterization of fitness for emerging strains, and assays measuring the activity of new antivirals would all be enhanced through the application of our method.",

Plaque assays were prepared using a semi-solid overlay of 1.2% Avicel RC-581 (FMC Biopolymers, Newark, Delaware, USA) as described by Matrosovich et. al. [57] and stained with crystal violet. Six-well plates (Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA, USA) were infected with , representing a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately , and stained every 12 h for 96 h. The plates were then photographed using a DSLR camera (Fujifilm S2 with a 60 mm Nikkor macro objective) and the areas of viral plaques were measured using the Threshold and Analyze Particle features of ImageJ, an NIH open-source image analysis software [58], [59]. All plaque radii at one timepoint (three independent experiments of three wells each) were averaged and the standard error of the mean was calculated. The radial growth rate was determined by linear regression to the average radii at time points prior to 72 h. Multiple-cycle viral yield assays for the A/Brisbane/59/2007 WT and H275Y mutant were performed with . Supernatants were harvested every 6 h for the first 36 h of infection and every 12 h subsequently, then titrated by plaque assay as previously described [22]. The geometric average and standard deviation was determined from three replicates at each time point. High MOI single-cycle yield assays were performed as described by Hurt et. al. [60].
