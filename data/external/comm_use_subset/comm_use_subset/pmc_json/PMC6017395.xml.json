Previous chemical investigations have proved that Salvia species possess two main classes of biologically active substances: phenylpropanoids and diterpenes [1,2,3]. Diterpenes, the principal active constituents of other Salvia plants, have numerous pharmacological functions, including antibacterial [4], anti-inflammatory [5], and anticancer activities [6,7]. In our preliminary experiment, the crude diterpenes-rich sample of S. prattii displayed considerable antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC: 125 \u03bcg/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC: 125 \u03bcg/mL), and Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC: 250 \u03bcg/mL). To identify the main antibacterial constituents of the sample, it is desirable to obtain the diterpenes in adequate purity and quantity. Thus, the objective of this work is to develop an efficient process for the purification of diterpenes from the diterpenes-rich sample of S. prattii.",

However, such methods have numerous drawbacks, such as low yields, being time-consuming, producing a large quantity of solvent waste, and non-suitability for large-scale industrial production. In recent times, high-speed counter-current chromatography, a liquid-liquid chromatographic method, was proposed for the isolation of diterpenes from Salvia plants [10,11,12]. Even though this technique offers high-separation efficiency, it requires several hours, rather than minutes needed for preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC).",

            "text": "Prep-HPLC, is considered as an efficient technique for the separation and purification of phenols, coumarins, flavonoids, and glycosides from intricate mixtures like traditional Tibetan medicines [13,14,15]. It is preferred over other chromatography methods, owing to higher efficiency, greater resolution, and better reproducibility through online monitoring and automatic control [16,17,18]. Consequently, prep-HPLC has been drawing ever-increasing attention from phytochemists and the pharma industry. However, a crude extract cannot be directly subjected to prep-HPLC separation; other separation techniques are usually required for enrichment of the main compounds of the crude extract. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography solid-phase extraction (HILIC-SPE), which employs stationary phases with polar functional groups bonded to silica gel surface, has been extensively used to enrich compounds of interest from natural products due to its applicability, ease of use and regeneration, as well as complementary selectivity to reversed-phase liquid chromatography [19]. A few studies reported the separation of diterpenes from S. miltiorrhiza using high-speed counter-current chromatography [20,21,22], but no reports mentioned the separation of diterpenes by a combination of HILIC-SPE and prep-HPLC. Hence, this study aimed to develop a valuable protocol for the purification of four antibacterial diterpenes from a diterpenes-rich S. prattii crude sample. The developed protocol succeeded in achieving large-scale preparation of four highly pure diterpenes from the crude sample of S. prattii, paving way for the potential development of antibacterial drugs.",

Mueller-Hinton broth was used to culture bacteria and an increase in optical density at 600 nm was used to monitor growth. The two-fold serial dilutions of the active extracts and diterpenes (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) were added into the sensitive strains, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), defined as the lowest concentration of the active extracts and diterpenes needed to inhibit the growth of the sensitive strains, was observed following incubation at 30 \u00b0C for 18 h according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, Wayne, PA, USA, 2008). The mid-exponential broth of sensitive strains treated without the extracts, diterpenes and DMSO were considered as the negative control. The growth of only DMSO-treated sensitive strains was monitored to eliminate the effect of DMSO. The mid-exponential broth of sensitive strains treated with the antibiotic cefotaxime and vancomycin (1.0 mg/mL) were used as positive controls.",

To select an appropriate pretreatment, two chromatographic stationary phases i.e., the bare silica gel and the XION stationary phases, in three separation modes were tested for the separation of the crude extract; the representative separation chromatograms are shown in Figure 1. As observed in Figure 1A,B, the main diterpenes had inferior resolution on the bare silica gel stationary phase compared to that on the XION stationary phase under the same elution conditions (n-hexane/ethanol solvent system). The main diterpenes showed weak retention on the XION stationary phase with the mobile phases of 0.2% v/v formic acid in acetonitrile and in water (Figure 1C). According to the manufacturer, XION is a cysteine-bond silica gel stationary phase, and cysteine is a polar group, which gives the XION stationary phase the retention behavior of normal-phase chromatography and hydrophilic interaction chromatography [23,24]. Thus, the XION stationary phase should be employed for sample pretreatment under the normal-phase mode due to the favorable separation profile (Figure 1B).",

Initially, HILIC-SPE was used to separate 18.0 g of crude diterpenes-rich sample into three fractions (2.8 g of fraction I, 3.4 g of fraction II, and 2.1 g of fraction III). Then, a DAC-50 prep-HPLC column containing Megress C18 stationary phase was used to isolate the diterpenes from the three fractions. The separation of each fraction on the Megress C18 was performed by optimizing the separation conditions on the Megress C18 analytical column and transforming the conditions to a Megress C18 preparative column. The coeluted diterpenes from the HILIC-SPE stationary phase were separated at large-scale sample amounts on the Megress C18 reversed stationary phase, brought about by the diverse sample separation mechanisms of both the stationary phases. Owing to the different selectivities and the optimized collection mode, 80.0 mg of tanshinone IIA, 62.0 mg of salvinolone, 70.0 mg of cryptotanshinone, and 68.0 mg of ferruginol at greater than 98% purity were prepared from 200.0 mg each of fractions I and II as well as 150.0 mg of fraction III with a single preparation. The purified diterpenes were identified as tanshinone IIA, salvinolone, cryptotanshinone, and ferruginol by UV, Mass, and NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, the present work offers an excellent protocol for the preparation of active diterpenes from plant sources.",
