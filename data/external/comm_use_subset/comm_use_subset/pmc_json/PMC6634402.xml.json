            "text": "Oral fluid (OF) samples are an aggregate sample composed of saliva and mucosal transudate, which may contain pathogens, antibodies to pathogens, or both, circulating in the herd. Collecting OF samples offers a convenient and unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially those nearing slaughter and movement to slaughter\u2014namely growing (grower) and market hog (finisher) herds. OF collection takes advantage of natural swine behavior. Samples are collected by hanging cotton ropes in one or more pens in a barn for pigs to chew for 20\u201330 minutes, causing minimal disruption of animal activities or farm operations [1\u20134]. The ease of OF sample collection and the ability to obtain disease status information from an entire group with a single sample, combined with its widespread industry usage for endemic diseases, positions OF sampling as a strong methodology for on-farm surveillance of swine pathogens. Producers currently collect and submit OF samples to monitor disease status of barns or premises with minimal training and without added cost, constraints, and biosecurity concerns associated with veterinary or animal health technician farm visits. Diagnostic testing is currently performed on ~30,000 OF samples per year at three high-volume laboratories representing more than 250 premises for domestic pathogens, including swine enteric coronavirus diseases (SECD), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) and others [5, 6].",

The matrix with the target virus may contain inhibitors that could prevent the assay from working. The abundance or concentration of the target virus in an OF sample is a host factor that depends on the organism concentration in an individual animal\u2019s oral fluid transudate, the number of animals chewing on the rope at collection time and shedding the virus in saliva, and the timeliness of the rope sampling relative to the virus shedding window. In a field setting, diseased animals may represent only a portion of the population in a particular pen of animals [9, 10]. Available information from a study on pigs experimentally infected with ASF, CSF, or FMD show that infected animals were observed chewing on ropes until severe clinical signs developed, concurrent with or after virus was detectable in OF samples [11]. Regarding the timeliness of rope sampling relative to shedding of virus, it is important to note that for all three diseases considered in this evaluation, the incubation and infectious periods vary depending on the strain of virus and its virulence [12]. From laboratory studies, ASF and FMD are detectable in OF samples before presentation of clinical signs and often concurrent to pyrexia [7, 11, 13, 14]. Detectable levels of CSF virus appear in OF samples at the same time or after presentation of clinical signs [11, 15, 16]. Mostly described for CSF, persistently infected animals may result from vertical transmission in-utero or infection shortly after birth. In such cases, distinct clinical signs may not be present, but animals will continue to shed virus without a detectable antibody response [17, 18]. Some strains of ASF and CSF may present with mild clinical signs indistinguishable from endemic diseases, complicating detection by clinical signs alone [18, 19].",

As additional data become available regarding diagnostic test parameters, disease distribution, movement patterns, and similar information, sampling design may need to be further refined.",

Note that the specimen types listed are not exhaustive; the list includes those samples that would currently be used in an ASF, CSF, or FMD investigation or are being compared (i.e., oral fluids). There is currently no evidence on how persistently infected animals would relate to ASF or CSF detection in OF samples. Presumably, ASF or CSF persistently infected animals would be detected by OF sampling due to viral shedding without clinical signs; this assumption was used in the evaluation. For the scenarios evaluated, 3 days was assumed to be the number of days the testing could detect disease prior to clinical signs; this value falls within the range of both ASF and FMD. This assumption was also used to estimate how frequently samples would need to be collected to detect disease prior to presentation of clinical signs.",

The number of hogs in the example counties was divided by a typical barn size of 1,250 to 1,750 animals (50\u201370 pens in a barn and 25 swine per pen) to arrive at these estimates [2, 5]. Average number of barns per premises, pigs per pen, and number of premises in a control area or surveillance zone were calculated based on these characteristics for evaluation. Using the informed assumptions for the population information, we estimated that 25 to 50 premises would fall within a hypothetical control area and 75\u2013150 premises would fall within the boundaries of a hypothetical surveillance zone. Based on a 2% prevalence detection threshold and 1,250 animals per barn, individual animal sampling would require at least 157 animals to be sampled per premises [20, 21]. The number of ropes per pen was held constant at one rope per pen [5]. For this assessment, the pen size was assumed to be 25 swine per pen, 50\u201370 pens per barn, 1,250\u20131,750 swine per barn, 25\u201350 premises per control area, and 75\u2013150 premises per surveillance zone.

For the scenarios in this paper, if an oral fluids sample has a non-negative result after follow-up testing at NVSL, an FAD investigation will be initiated and confirmatory testing will be performed at the NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. The estimated value of 8 hours of VS employee time is $400 to complete an FAD investigation and ship samples to laboratories for each premises. As a result, the total cost of a false positive would be a minimum of $471 (CSF) to $540 (ASF or FMD), assuming that samples are collected from one animal during an epidemiologic investigation. These costs exclude any domestic business or trade impacts. These characteristics are summarized in Table 3.",

Because OF samples provide aggregate information for the premises as a whole within either a control area or surveillance zone, the number of samples required every 5 days for the duration of the outbreak would be much lower for OF sampling (36\u201363 samples per premises) than for individual animal sampling (157 samples per premises) to achieve 0.95 detection probability at the 20% prevalence detection threshold.

During an outbreak response, OF sample testing offers many advantages compared to individual animal sampling, including minimal disruption of animal and farm activities and a reduction in the number of samples required, thus reducing testing costs. In both scenarios 1 and 2, the cost-effectiveness ratio of aggregate OF samples is lower than individual animal sampling. Additionally, OF sample testing could decrease resource utilization. Given basic training, producers can collect and submit OF samples to emergency response officials at the premises line of separation; emergency response officials would not need to enter the farm. This approach could decrease resource costs associated with personal protective equipment, waste disposal, and personnel downtime between farms, minimizing potential contamination between premises by eliminating animal contact. Depending on the disease, OF sample testing may detect viral presence prior to, or concurrent with, clinical signs. This information could assist policymakers and incident commanders with more timely, cost-effective information upon which to base decisions. Because poor sample handling technique can decrease test sensitivity, a certification/training program on proper sample collection and packaging should be implemented for farm personnel, accredited veterinarians, veterinary paraprofessionals, and response officials. Such a program, outlined in the Secure Pork Supply Plan for Active Observational Surveillance [44], would assist with outbreak preparedness and should lead to higher quality samples.",

Oral fluid sampling may be highly efficacious in this scenario if the benefit of preventing disease spread is greater than the cost of a short but intensive sampling scheme. Presuming use during an outbreak to assist in prioritization of incident response activities (e.g., to prioritize order of formal surveillance or inspection visits), the consequences of a false negative or positive are similarly constrained. Laboratory capacity could limit the application of any novel testing strategy if the number of samples generated by an outbreak exceeds laboratory capabilities. Regardless of the scale of an actual outbreak, OF collection is expected to generate fewer samples compared with individual animal sampling, thus decreasing testing costs and making more effective use of laboratory capacity.

This scenario could be modified to lower levels of sampling for different goals, which would still be useful in potentially detecting disease earlier than with passive surveillance alone while lowering overall cost, which was partially explored in scenario 4. The windows of detection for ASF, CSF, and FMD were extrapolated from laboratory experiments using high virulence strains, leading to rapid clinical progression of disease. The detection window with OF samples and progression of clinical signs are not as thoroughly documented when less virulent strains of ASF, CSF, or FMD are studied. Given the currently available data on highly virulent CSF detection in OF samples, it is unlikely this sampling and testing scenario fits a CSF rapid detection purpose because clinical signs, if seen at all, present at the same time as detectable virus in OF samples.
