Although low tidal volume ventilation, neuromuscular blockers and prone positioning ventilation have advanced treatments [7]\u2013[9], there are currently no reliable predictive markers for early detection of ARDS in predisposed individuals. Nonetheless, many efforts have been mounted to identify biologic markers, or biomarkers, for ARDS in critically ill patients, including studies of pulmonary edema fluid, blood, and urine [10]\u2013[12]. Recent advances on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ARDS have identified several clinical biomarkers to assess disease severity and outcome, including specific cytokines and their receptors (IL-6, IL-8, soluble tumor factor receptors I and II), products of epithelial and endothelial injury [receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), surfactant protein D, ICAM-1, and von Willebrand factor antigen], and markers of altered coagulation (protein C and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) [13]. However, no individual biomarker is strongly associated with outcomes and thus cannot provide sufficient discriminating power for either diagnosis or prognosis.",

Given the acute onset and rapid clinical progress of ARDS, a prospectively enrolled cohort study in multicenter ICUs is suitable for more complete and unbiased ARDS/ALI research [14]. Using a protocol modified from a molecular epidemiology ARDS study established in Boston, MA (Boston cohort) [14], we established a multicenter ARDS cohort in Beijing, China (Beijing cohort) in 2009. The overarching objectives of establishing this prospective cohort are to validate relevant biomarkers to ARDS, as well as genetic polymorphisms, discovered in previous USA studies in Chinese population, and discover new biomarkers of ARDS with a comprehensive sampling protocol. In this report, we present initial results on the clinical factors associated with ARDS development and mortality in individuals with or at risk for ARDS.

Upper zone redistribution and pulmonary vascular congestion were not considered infiltrates. Two pulmonary and critical care physicians interpreted daily chest radiographs; any disagreement went to a third intensivist for arbitration. All physicians underwent a consensus training session on the radiologic criteria for ARDS. All were blinded to the clinical status of the patients.",

Table 1 also shows the proportions of patients who developed ARDS with each condition. Patients with sepsis (p = 0.01), aspiration (p = 0.004), or multiple predisposing conditions (p<0.0001) had significantly higher ARDS risk. Patients with direct pulmonary injury were more likely to develop ARDS than patients with extra pulmonary injury (p = 0.02). From multivariate modeling, sepsis [odds ratio (OR) = 5.58; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.70\u201318.26; p = 0.005), direct pulmonary injury (OR = 3.22; 95% CI = 1.60\u20136.47; p = 0.001), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count <80\u00d7103/\u00b5L) (OR = 2.67; 95% CI = 1.27\u20135.62; p = 0.005) [20] were associated with development of ARDS.Respiratory rate (>30 breaths/min), aspiration, and >1 risks for ARDS were also evaluated in model selection but were eliminated during model selection (not significant). APACHE II score (removing age and gender components), age, and gender were forced in as covariatesbut not significant in logistic regression analyses. Known factors related to ARDS, including septic shock, diabetes, and alcohol use, were also tested either by forcing as covariates, individually or combined into the model, and did not change the significant associations of sepsis, direct pulmonary injury, and thrombocytopenia with the development of ARDS (data not shown).Because drinking habits in China differ from those in the U.S.,and it was difficult to develop a comparable criterion for alcohol abuse, we did not including alcohol abuse as risk factor in the analysis.",

In another cohort of ALI in Rochester, Minnesota (Mayo Clinic), however, researchers did not observe significant difference of platelet count between ALI and non-ALI patients with septic shock [18]. Since the Rochester cohort only focuses on a subgroup ICU patients with septic shock, our stratified analysis revealed that thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with ARDS in both the Beijing cohort and the Boston cohort in the subgroup patients with septic shock, but not in non-septic shock subgroup.

Thrombocytopenia in ICU patients is caused by multiple factors [34] and is considered a marker of illness severity with Multiple Organ Dysfunction Scores (MODS), SimplifiedAcute Physiology Scores (SAPS), and APACHE scores.Sepsis alone can cause moderate thrombocytopenia, as maladaptive platelet-neutrophil interactionssignificantly increase platelet activation and aggregation, as well as tissue injury [35]. The lung epithelium is central to both the pathogenesis and resolution of ARDS, and intra-alveolar coagulation changes (e.g., platelet-fibrin deposition and pulmonary vascular thrombi) are hallmarks of pathologic changes in ARDS [36]. Thus, thrombocytopenia likely contributes to the development of ARDS; in return, the coexistence of ARDS may aggravate thrombocytopenia to increase mortality of critically ill patients.",

Although platelet counts are routinely measured daily in the ICU, the epidemiology of thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients has not been well studied. Further, illness severity scoring systems inconsistently consider platelet count;for example, the SOFA score incorporates platelet count, whereas the APACHE score does not. Different platelet count thresholds have been used in epidemiological studies for the prevalence, incidence, risk factors, and consequences of thrombocytopenia among critically ill patients [37]. Currently, the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodrecommends a platelet count threshold of <100\u00d7103/\u00b5L, or a >30% decrease in platelet counts, for epidemiological research of thrombocytopenia [20]. Taking advantage of a large patient population in the Boston cohort, we conducted a sensitivity analysis and determined that platelet count (<100\u00d7103/\u00b5L) was a significant prognostic marker for ARDS. We further replicated this cut-point value in the Beijing cohort.",

            "text": "There were some differences between the Beijing and Boston cohorts. When evaluated individually, there were different association profiles for thrombocytopenia and ARDS with mortality of all patients with at least one risk factor for ARDS. Thrombocytopenia was significantly associated with higher mortality in the Beijing cohort, but not the Boston cohort. Conversely, ARDSwas associated with higher mortality in the Boston cohort, but not the Beijing cohort. It is unexpected that ARDS did not increase mortality in the Beijing cohort, and. it is counter-intuitive that in the univariate analysis thrombocytopenia would be associated with increased mortality in the ARDS group but not in the non-ARDS group given that thrombocytopenia is a marker of severity of illness in critical care populations generally. However, the raw numbers were in the direction of higher mortality with lower platelets in the non-ARDS group, these findings could be explained by the limitation of multiple subgroup analysis in a relatively small dataset. Moreover, for several known risk factors or comorbidities of ARDS [14], [24]\u2013[26], such as septic shock, pneumonia, pancreatitis, trauma, multiple transfusions, and diabetes, we did not observe significant different between ARDS and non-ARDS patients in the Beijing cohort. Due to the relative scarcityand high cost of medical resources to the general Chinese population, the participating hospital ICUs in the Beijing cohortmay have admitted more severely ill patients, resulting in less difference in illness severity between ARDS and non-ARDS patients. Accordingly, although most physiologic variables of the first 24 hours of ICU admission, including APACHE score, were comparable between ARDS and non-ARDS Beijing cohort patients, thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <80\u00d7103/\u00b5L) was more common in the Beijing cohort than the Boston cohort (30.3% vs. 13.9%, respectively; p<0.0001). It is also possible that different ethnicities account for the observed differencesbetween cohorts.",

In the Beijing cohort, we identified 23 (12.9%) cases of severe pancreatitis, similar to a previous report of 15.6% in a large Chinese ICU survey [39]. About 52% of severe pancreatitis cases eventually developed ARDS during ICU admission. Severe pancreatitis was not associated with ARDS risk, but was associated with lower mortality.
