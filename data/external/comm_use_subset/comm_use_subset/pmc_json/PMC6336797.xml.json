In the cleaved form, GPCL, the receptor-binding site is exposed and interacts with the intracellular receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1).

In the latter study, Carette and colleagues used cells transduced with a gene-trapping retrovirus and infected them with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) bearing the EBOV glycoprotein. The surviving cells were expanded and their insertion sites mapped. NPC1 was the strongest hit in this screen, but other hits included genes from the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which is involved in the fusion of endosomes to lysosomes; cathepsin B (CTSB)15; the lipid kinase PIKFYVE16; and N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase alpha and beta subunits (GNPTAB). Another genome-wide screen used short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 cells, using lentivirus bearing the MARV glycoprotein17. These authors reported NPC1, VPS16 (a HOPS complex subunit), and cathepsin L (CTSL) as hits. A third screen used a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) method in 293T cells with infectious EBOV, and identified NPC1, CTSB and HOPS complex subunits. In addition to genes important for endosome maturation (FIG4, PIKFYVE), the lysosomal protein BRI3, and RAB39B, a GTPase involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking were reported18. Finally, Martin and colleagues recently screened a siRNA library against an EBOV minigenome, a version of the genome with viral genes replaced by a reporter which is replicated by co-expressed viral proteins, to identify host factors important for replication and transcription in HEK293 cells19. This screen identified carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase and dihydroorotase (CAD) and the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway as being essential for EBOV replication and transcription.",

            "text": "Lysosomes mediate the degradation of extra- and intracellular material through an array of hydrolases, including proteases such as cathepsins20. Cathepsin B (CatB) is an essential factor for EBOV entry in cell culture, while cathepsin L (CatL) plays an accessory role. Together they mediate the stepwise cleavage of GP to GPCL15. Many proteins are transported to lysosomes via the mannose-6-phosphate pathway21,22. N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (GlcNAc-phosphotransferase) is a Golgi-resident enzyme that participates in the formation of mannose 6-phosphate on the glycans of newly synthesized proteins, which are then recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors and transported to lysosomes. GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is a 540 kiloDalton (kDa) heterotrimer with an \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32 structure; the GNPTAB gene encodes the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits, whereas the \u03b3-subunit is encoded by GNPTG. To be activated, the GNPTAB polypeptide must be cleaved into the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits by the cellular protease SKI-1/S1P23,24. Low levels of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity are associated with the LSD mucolipidosis25. In this slowly progressive metabolic disease, lysosomal hydrolases are improperly targeted and, rather than being trafficked to lysosomes, become secreted. Mucolipidosis type II (MLII), also called inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, is associated with variants in GNPTAB that result in little or no functional GlcNAc-phosphotransferase26. Mucolipidosis type III alpha/beta (MLIII alpha/beta), also called pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, is associated with GNPTAB variants that retain some residual GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity. MLIII alpha/beta progresses more slowly and is generally less severe than MLII27. A third LSD, mucolipidosis type III gamma (MLIII gamma), is caused by variants in GNPTG28.",

Here, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen using the GeCKOv2 library in Huh7.5.1 cells29, and used authentic EBOV (Mayinga strain) to infect the library-transduced cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 (Fig. 1). Extensive cell death occurred in the infected culture. Surviving cells were then expanded, their genomic DNA was extracted, and their single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences were determined. Several genes with significantly enriched sgRNAs were identified (Table 1, Supplementary Data 1 & 2). NPC1 was the top-ranked hit with 5 of 6 sgRNAs enriched. The second hit was Spinster-like 1 (SPNS1), which encodes a putative sugar transporter involved in lysosome function30. The third hit was Solute Carrier Family 30 Member 1 (SLC30A1), which encodes Zinc Transporter Protein 131. Further work will be required to confirm a role for these proteins in EBOV infection. Other hits included the previously reported subunits of the HOPS complex VPS16, VPS33A and VPS18 (Tables 1 and 2). UVRAG (Ultraviolet Radiation Resistance-Associated), which is required for influenza A and VSV entry32 but not previously implicated in EBOV infection, was also found. CTSL was only a minor hit, while CTSB was not significant.",

Mutations in the gene of interest were confirmed by sequencing. Since the selection in our screen was based on the survival of transduced cells following EBOV infection, we first tested the viability of these cells after infection. The parental HAP1 cells, and GNPTAB\u2212 and NPC1\u2212 derivatives, were infected and their viability was determined 6 days post infection. Due to EBOV-induced cytopathic effect, the viability of the parental HAP1 cells was reduced to ~25% of that of mock-infected cells, whereas the GNPTAB\u2212 and NPC1\u2212 remained ~90% viable after infection (Fig. 2a). When these cells were infected with recombinant EBOV expressing the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen33 (EBOV-ZsG), robust fluorescence was observed in parental HAP1 cells; fluorescence was lower in GNPTAB\u2212 cells, and lowest in NPC1\u2212 cells (Fig. 2b). This effect was not due to differences in cell growth, as mock-infected cultures had similar growth rates (Supplementary Figure 1a). We tested the ability of these cells to support infection by wild-type EBOV and found ~170-fold less virus yield in GNPTAB\u2212 cells than in parental HAP1 cells (Fig. 2c). To determine the specificity of this effect, GNPTAB\u2212 cells were infected with a panel of hemorrhagic fever viruses. These cells did not yield less reporter arenavirus Lassa virus (LASV-ZsG; Supplementary Figure 2a & b), flavivirus Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV; Supplementary Figure 2d) or reporter phenuivirus Rift Valley fever virus expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (RVFV-GFP; Supplementary Figure 2e). The GNPTAB\u2212 cells did, however, produce less Marburg virus (MARV-ZsG; up to 42-fold less than parental cells, Supplementary Figure 2f), RESTV (up to 207-fold less; Supplementary Figure 2g) and the paramyxovirus Nipah virus (NiV-ZsG, up to 640-fold less, Supplementary Figure 2h).",

We did not detect endogenous GNPTAB (three different commercially available antibodies were tested), but could detect GNPTAB-myc in the appropriately transduced cell populations (Fig. 3a, b). Each of the transduced cell lines still expressed NPC1 (Fig. 3b). When infected with EBOV, the GNPTAB\u2212 cells transduced to express GUS (GNPTAB- + GUS) remained refractory to EBOV-induced cell death, whereas the viability of those reconstituted with GNPTAB-myc was significantly reduced (Fig. 3c). In addition, the GNPTAB-myc reconstituted cells supported infection by EBOV-ZsG, whereas infection remained impaired in cells transduced to express GUS (Fig. 3d). The ability to support EBOV infection was not correlated with growth rate, as each grew similarly (Supplementary Figure 1b). In addition, the growth of LASV-ZsG was similar in each of the reconstituted cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2c).

Each of the healthy control fibroblasts supported infection by EBOV-ZsG (Fig. 4a\u2013d, Supplementary Figure 3). In contrast, fibroblasts from 2 of the NP-C patients (GM17914 and GM18411) failed to support detectable EBOV replication (Fig. 4a, c). The third NP-C cell line (GM03123) supported a delayed, low level of infection (Fig. 4b). This patient was compound heterozygous at the NPC1 allele, having the P237S and I1061T variants. While I1061T has been well characterized as associated with NP-C, the P237S variant was found to be non-pathogenic35, consistent with the reduced level of infection observed. When fibroblasts from families of MLII patients were infected, in each case, the maternal and paternal cells supported EBOV-ZsG infection, but the proband\u2019s cells did not (Fig. 4a\u2013c). The level of infection in cells from each of the three MLII probands was comparable to that in cells from NP-C patients. The growth rate of the fibroblast cells did not correlate with their ability to support EBOV infection (Supplementary Figure 5). Fibroblasts from two MLII probands (GM01586 and GM03066) and three healthy control patients were infected with LASV-ZsG, AHFV or RVFV-GFP. The growth of AHFV and RVFV-GFP in the MLII proband cells was unimpaired, being similar to that in the healthy fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure 6c & e). For LASV-ZsG, virus yield was similar in MLII and healthy fibroblasts for most of the time-course, but was modestly lower from the MLII cells at the day 4 time-point (Supplementary Figure 6a). Overall, this suggests that the impaired growth of EBOV in these cells was not simply due to a generalized lack of support for viral infection.",

Bands consistent with the mature single-chain forms of CatB (30 kDa) and CatL (32 kDa) were not detected in GNPTAB- cells, but expression of both was restored following reconstitution with GNPTAB-myc (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Figure 7a & b). Since CatB is essential for Zaire-EBOV entry, we performed assays for CatB function using fluorescent substrate peptides that become dequenched after proteolysis. We used inhibitors of CatB (Bi) and CatL (Li), to demonstrate that CatB activity was specifically detected. Lysates from the parental HAP1 cells and the NPC1\u2212 knockout cells possessed robust CatB activity (Fig. 5b) that was inhibited by adding Bi but not Li. In contrast, CatB activity was significantly lower in the GNPTAB\u2212 knockout cells (Fig. 5b). CatB activity was restored by GNPTAB-myc expression (Fig. 5c).

We hypothesized that PF-429242, an inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P36, would inhibit EBOV infection by blocking GNPTAB activation. First, we determined if PF-429242 could prevent cleavage of the GNPTAB precursor (PT-\u03b1\u03b2) to its alpha (PT-\u03b1) and beta subunits (PT-\u03b2). Cells transfected to express GNPTAB-myc and treated with increasing concentrations of PF-429242 exhibited less PT-\u03b1\u03b2 processing, as evidenced by a reduced amount of PT-\u03b2-myc (Fig. 6a). PF-429242 had no effect on NPC1 expression levels (Fig. 6b). We examined the effect of PF-429242 on EBOV-GP-mediated entry using pseudotyped lentiviral particles bearing the EBOV-GP (EBOVpp). The compound blocked EBOVpp entry with a mean 50% effective concentration (EC50) \u00b1 s.d. of 0.80 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5M (n = 3; Fig. 6c), whereas the inhibition of particles pseudotyped with VSV-G protein (VSVpp; EC50 = 12.80 \u00b1 0.82 \u00b5M, n = 3; Fig. 6c) was similar to the effect on cell viability (Fig. 6d). PF-429242 inhibited EBOV-ZsG virus infection with a mean EC50 of 0.95 \u00b1 0.57 \u00b5M (n = 6), with a selectivity index (SI) of 15 (Fig. 6d). A control compound, 2\u2032-C-methylcytidine (2\u2032-CMC)37, blocked AHFV-induced CPE in A549 cells, while PF-429242 had no effect (Supplementary Figure 8a). Similarly, RVFV-GFP fluorescence in Huh7 cells was inhibited by the 2\u2032-deoxyfluorocytidine (2\u2032-dFC) control38, but the inhibition induced by PF-429242 was consistent with cytotoxicity (compare Fig. 6d and Supplementary Figure 8b). Thus, the SKI-1 inhibitor PF-429242 blocked GNPTAB maturation and specifically inhibited EBOV-GP-mediated entry and EBOV infection.",

We performed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to attempt to identify genes important for authentic EBOV infection. Genome-wide screens can frequently yield discordant results39,40, with different techniques, cell lines and challenge methods likely being sources of discrepancy. For example, retroviral gene-trapping and CRISPR-Cas9 methods are capable of inducing gene knockouts, whereas si- and shRNA use RNA interference (RNAi) to degrade transcripts. For a protein with a long half-life, or a very abundant transcript, a knockout screening method may be more effective than a knockdown. This may be why GNPTAB was a hit in two screens that used gene knockout, but not in those using RNAi (Table 2). We used authentic EBOV as the challenge virus. While this has benefits in recapitulating the genuine infection process, EBOV does have a propensity to form defective-interfering particles41 which may cause false-positive hits. It should be noted that in addition to genes required for EBOV infection, genes required for the death of EBOV-infected cells should also be identified in our screen.",

While GNPTAB is required for the correct localization of numerous lysosomal hydrolases, and we cannot exclude the involvement of other factors, lack of EBOV infection correlated with the loss of CatB activity, which is known to be required for EBOV entry.

For example, entry mediated by EBOV GP was strongly dependent upon CatB, whereas MARV GP was more dependent upon CatL42. RESTV GP was not sensitive to the loss of CatB and CatL, but was inhibited by the broad cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, suggesting that a different cysteine protease is required for RESTV infection42. We found that RESTV infection of GNPTAB- cells was impaired (Supplementary Figure 2g), consistent with RESTV GP activation being dependent upon a lysosomal protease, transported there through the action of GNPTAB. Additional cysteine proteases are required even for viruses that use CatB, as viruses bearing precleaved glycoproteins remain sensitive to inhibition by E-6442\u201345. This is consistent with a multi-step model where initial cleavages by CatB and L expose the NPC1 -binding domain, but an additional E64-sensitive step(s), mediated by another lysosomal protease, is required for fusion to occur. Interestingly, wild-type, CTSB\u2212/\u2212, and CTSL\u2212/\u2212 mice were equally susceptible to lethal challenge with mouse-adapted EBOV46. This suggests that in vivo, at least for mouse-adapted EBOV in mice, GP may be cleaved by proteases other than CatB and CatL. This could be due to differences in the specificities of the different species\u2019 cathepsins, or may also be the case during human infection.",

Inhibition of GNPTAB would also be predicted to block infection by other viruses that require cathepsins, such as Nipah virus47,48 (Supplementary Figure 2h), SARS-coronavirus49, and reoviruses50. Cathepsins are thought to be involved in antigen processing, generating peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells51\u201353. Consequently, suppressing GNPTAB function may prevent the initiation of an adaptive immune response, though we have been unable to find any reference to immune suppression in the context of mucolipidosis patients.

PF-429242 was originally developed to reduce cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, as SKI-1/S1P is also responsible for processing sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, which are major transcriptional regulators of cholesterol synthesis. PF-429242 inhibited SKI-1/S1P activity with an IC50 of 0.2 \u00b5M and cholesterol synthesis with an EC50 of 0.5 \u00b5M36. We recently demonstrated that the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins can suppress EBOV infection by interfering with proper GP processing54. Similarly, the cholesterol-reducing function of PF-429242 may also prevent correct GP glycosylation, and this mechanism may contribute to its anti-EBOV activity. Indeed, PF-429242 inhibits infection by a number of viruses in cell culture because SKI-1/S1P is required for the maturation of their glycoproteins55,56 or because they are dependent upon high levels of cellular cholesterol for entry57. The inactivation of GNPTAB and the improper trafficking of lysosomal proteins are additional mechanisms that may contribute to the antiviral activity of this compound. Notably, however, PF-429242 has a high clearance rate (75 mL/min/kg) and low oral availability (~5%)36, and failed to protect mice from severe fever upon challenge with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus58.",

Using a compound like PF-429242 to block GNPTAB function, and consequently lysosomal cathepsin activities, should inhibit EBOV infection. Such treatment would essentially involve the deliberate induction of a LSD to prevent EBOV from entering via lysosomes, as has been suggested previously for suppression of NPC1. While GNPTAB deficiency is associated with mucolipidosis, the clinical manifestations occur much more slowly than the acute course of EBOV infection, and the risks of short-term GNPTAB inhibition may be outweighed by the benefits for a disease with a high case fatality rate. We found that fibroblasts from several patients with MLIII, the less severe form of mucolipidosis associated with residual levels of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity, did not efficiently support EBOV growth, suggesting that even a partial reduction in GNPTAB activity might be sufficient to reduce infection.",

The GeCKO v2 library was gift from Feng Zhang, acquired from Addgene (#1000000048; Watertown, USA). VSV-G-pseudotyped GeCKOv2 lentiviruses were generated at the University of Michigan vector core. Each packaged GeCKOv2 A or B lentiviral half-library was used to transduce 16 million Huh7.5.1 cells as a MOI of 0.3 in 10-cm dishes29. After transduction, the cells were selected for 6 days with 2 \u00b5g/mL puromycin, then frozen and transferred to CDC. Following revival of each half-library, 107 transduced cells were infected with wild-type EBOV (Mayinga strain) at an MOI of 0.3. Three days post infection, the cells were passaged at a 1:5 ratio. Surviving cells were expanded, and lysed in TriPure (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), to inactivate EBOV present in the sample. The lysates were then transferred from BSL-4 containment to a BSL-2 laboratory and genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using the TriPure method. The sgRNA sequences were amplified in two sequential PCR reactions, both using Herculase II enzyme (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA). For the first reaction, for gDNA from EBOV-selected cells and from input library cells, 13 replicate 100 \u00b5L reactions were set up, each with 10 \u00b5g of extracted gDNA, and products were amplified over 18 cycles using primers PCR#1-forward and \u2013reverse (listed in Supplementary Table 1). The appropriate PCR#1 reactions were then pooled and used as template in the second reaction with forward (F01-06) and reverse (R01-R04) primers (Supplementary Table 1) to add Illumina adaptors and barcodes63, over 15 cycles. The resulting PCR products were purified on an agarose gel (Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit, Zymo Research, Irvine, USA), analyzed using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Analysis Kit (Agilent) and quantified using a NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA). Products were mixed in equimolar concentrations and sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 at Omega Bioservices (Norcross, USA). CLC Genomics Workbench 10 (Qiagen, Redwood City, USA) was used to trim adapter sequences and demultiplex FASTQ files.

(1) The SKI-1/S1P protease cleaves the GNPTAB precursor to yield the individual \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, which then assemble with the \u03b3 subunit to form the GlcNAc-phosphotransferase enzyme. (2) GlcNAc-phosphotransferase catalyzes the transfer of mannose-6-phosphate onto the glycans of proteins destined to be transported to the lysosome, such as pro-cathepsin B and pro-cathepsin L. (3) The mannose-6-phosphate receptor recognizes its substrates and mediates their transport to the lysosome. (4) Once in the lysosome, pro-cathepsins cleave to yield the mature cathepsins. (5) The activated cathepsins cleave the EBOV GP, removing the glycan-cap and mucin-like domains, and allowing the receptor-binding site to interact with NPC1, priming the GP for fusion. (6) Following fusion, the viral nucleocapsid enters into the cell cytoplasm where replication can be initiated. Blocking GlcNAc-phosphotransferase activity, either by inhibition of the SKI-1/S1P protease at (1), or by the absence of functional enzyme in (2), has the effect of preventing EBOV entry",
