While both subclones supported similar levels of DENV uptake and infection under DENV only conditions, infection under ADE conditions led to significantly higher DENV-2 titres in THP-1.2S compared to THP-1.2R. The difference in susceptibility to ADE was due to higher levels of LILRB1 expression on THP-1.2S. Antibody-opsonized DENV co-ligated LILRB1 to down-regulate activating Fc\u03b3R-mediated signaling, reducing induction of ISGs for enhanced DENV replication in THP-1.2S6. Since LILRB1 signaling modulates Syk activity, which in turn regulates phagosome trafficking and maturation13, we examined here if reduced Syk activity results in altered phagosomal compartmentalization of DENV that could also contribute to enhanced viral replication during ADE.",

Recovery of DENV RNA was most abundant in fraction 3, or the densest fraction collected (Fig. 1A). Similar findings were obtained when DENV endocytic vesicles were isolated using a continuous sucrose gradient, which allows flotation of DENV-containing vesicles at their buoyant density. Importantly, the peak in viral RNA recovery using both methods of isolation corresponded to fractions of similar density, reinforcing the reproducibility of this assay (Fig. 1B). As the yield of viral RNA recovery during purification of DENV endocytic vesicles with a step sucrose gradient was higher, this method was used for subsequent experiments.",

As the sizes of endosomal and lysosomal compartments range from 200 nm to 600 nm1516, the use of Nanosight allows tracking of DENV with cellular endocytic machinery. DENV was first labeled with DiD (1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032\u2013 tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt), a lipophilic fluorescent dye. Following uptake and fusion of the virus and host cell membranes, its fluorescence unquenches, allowing discrimination of DiD-particles using Nanosight under fluorescence mode. The modal size of DiD-particles was 2 to 3 fold larger than modal size of nanoparticles detected under light scatter mode (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly, the majority of DiD-particles were detected in fraction 3 in both DENV only and ADE infection (Fig. 1C), consistent with the bulk of viral RNA being recovered from fraction 3 (Fig. 1A). The modal size of 274 nm and 246 nm for DiD-particles isolated following DENV only and ADE infection, respectively, also suggests the possibility that DENV is contained within endosomal vesicles (Fig. 1C).",

This suggests that at 2 hours post-infection, DENV is compartmentalized in late endosomes or lysosomes following uptake into the host cell. The enrichment of endosomal markers in isolated fractions relative to whole cell lysate is further validation that purification of DENV endocytic vesicles can be performed on a step sucrose gradient (Supplementary Fig. S1). Organelle markers were also used to verify the purity of DENV endocytic vesicle isolation. Although Golgi apparatus (GM130) and peroxisomes (PMP70) were not detected, both ER (calnexin and BiP) and mitochondria (HSP60) co-isolated with DENV endocytic vesicles (Supplementary Fig. S1). ER proteins are known to mediate phagosome trafficking and have been co-isolated with latex bead phagosomes17. HSP60, which could be important for DENV replication as siRNA knockdown of HSP60 in U937 monocytic cells led to reduced viral replication and increased IFN-\u03b1 production18, was also detected in our Western blots.",

Interestingly, lysosomal proteins were enriched in THP-1.2R but reduced in THP-1.2S during ADE (Fig. 1D). Conversely, proteins involved in endocytosis and Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis were enriched in THP-1.2S during ADE (Fig. 1D). That DENV was trafficked to lysosomal compartments in THP-1.2R during ADE was substantiated by activation of lysosomal hydrolases, which are processed to their catalytically active form upon phagosome acidification. Specifically, the expression of active cathepsin D (CatD), a lysosomal protease with optimal activity at acidic pH, was higher in THP-1.2R compared to THP-1.2S (Fig. 1E).",

Since acidification of the subcellular environment increases fluorescence intensity of pHrodo but not AF488, the ratio of fluorescence intensity between pHrodo and AF488 served as a semi-quantitative measure of phagosome acidification. This approach was previously used to assess phagosome acidification during infection with bacteria that was simultaneously labelled with pHrodo and a pH-insensitive fluorescent probe1920.

However, Fc\u03b3R-mediated uptake of antibody-opsonized DENV during ADE also leads to rapid DENV phagosome acidification and activation of lysosomal enzymes that can result in DENV degradation. Reducing or slowing phagosome acidification during ADE could allow DENV to escape lysosomal degradation thus promoting enhanced intracellular survival of DENV, albeit with delayed viral uncoating and fusion. To clarify if phagosome acidification is a critical determinant for viral release and subsequent viral replication, we tested if inhibition of phagosome acidification with the lysosomotropic weak bases, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and CQ, could result in enhanced infection during ADE.",

That DENV is destined for phagolysosomal degradation following Fc\u03b3R-mediated uptake during ADE, is consistent with previous findings that phagosomes containing antibody-opsonized beads matured faster into phagolysosomes, compared to uncoated beads24. Furthermore, both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Helicobacter pylori opsonized with IgG resulted in more rapid phagosome maturation and were more efficiently destroyed than non-opsonized bacterial particles2526. The findings of our study add to this body of knowledge. During ADE, antibody-opsonized DENV co-ligates the ITIM-bearing LILRB1, which signals through SHP-1 to dephosphorylate Syk. Reduced Syk signaling not only results in suppressed ISG induction6, it also downregulates phagosome acidification, permitting DENV to escape lysosomal degradation. SHP-1 is thought to inhibit phagosome acidification by acting on membrane fusion during phagosome trafficking19. Defects in phagosome acidification have also been observed in SHP-1 deficient mouse macrophages27. Our findings thus agree with recent studies that have demonstrated increased viral fusion during ADE, which leads to enhanced production of infectious DENV titres28.",
