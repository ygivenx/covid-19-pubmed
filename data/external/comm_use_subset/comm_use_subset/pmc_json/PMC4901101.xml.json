Maternal and childhood illness remain major public health threats in the developing world. In the first world, aging populations suffer a burden of chronic non-communicable illnesses, such as vascular disease, diabetes, cancer, etc. Aside from the global burden of disease, US health care is still too expensive for many patients; physicians are pressed to increase revenue while hospitals and medical centers profit from people\u2019s illness; insurance is a headache for patients, lawmakers and doctors, with no clear winners except insurance companies; and the focus of care remains on treatment rather than prevention. The current healthcare system, based on care provision at central, expensive hospitals, is not financially efficient, practical for providers, or accessible to all patients. Efforts to fix the \u201cbroken\u201d system have involved cutting costs and services, limiting clinicians\u2019 ability to practice, or giving patients too much or too little care, without attention to outcomes.",

This excellent system helps us plan how medical resources should be allocated to combat disease. The GBD study classifies worldwide disease into non-communicable disease and communicable disease. At present, non-communicable diseases (such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc.) are overtaking communicable diseases (such as influenza, Ebola, HIV, etc.) in numbers and costs. Furthermore, the prevalence of diseases associated with famine and malnutrition is now being surpassed by the incidence of diseases associated with being overweight. It is astounding that more people now die from obesity rather than starvation (Maureen Quigley, personal communication). These epidemiological trends correlate with demographic shifts to increase the burden of disease.",

This recent change in long-term trajectory of funding is partially attributed to the recognition that communicable disease remains a significant and persistent threat to global health and to the health of the American people, largely as a consequence of the Ebola epidemic of 2014\u201315, described later in this paper [15].The long-term decline in funding for communicable disease, and increased funding for chronic illness continues at the global level, reflected in the budget of the WHO. WHO funding for communicable diseases declined significantly from $913 million in 2012 to $841 million in 2014\u201315, a net reduction of $72 million. Over this same time span, funding for non-communicable diseases increased from $264 million to $318 million, an increase of 20.45 % [16].The WHO budget for 2016\u201317 projects an increase to $339 million for non-communicable disease, whereas the budget for communicable disease is expected to decrease to $765 million in 2016\u201317 [17].If we combine the data sources above, consequently (despite the considerable economic and political destabilization generated by the Ebola epidemic of 2014\u201315), the WHO budget for communicable illness is projected to decline significantly from 2012 to 2016, from $913 million to $765 million, a decline of 16.21 %.\n",

According to the WHO, 3.3 billion people are at risk of malaria infection, 1.2 billion of those are at high risk of contracting the illness, and ongoing transmission is occurring in 97 countries. In 2013, there were an estimated 198 million cases of malaria, and approximately 580,000 deaths, with 90 % of this morbidity and mortality occurring in Africa [18].

The expansion of cases of Ebola into Zaire, and beyond West Africa to the US, Spain, and United Kingdom (UK), generated a global epidemic of fear. Ultimately, the socio-political destabilization generated by the epidemic resulted in its designation as a threat to national security by the US, and to international security by the United Nations Security Council in Resolutions 2176 and 2177 [20, 21]. As a second example, the epidemic of cholera that has swept across Haiti since 2010 has caused 8768 deaths and sickened approximately 750,000 [22]. It has also undermined the legitimacy of the United Nations\u2019 (UN) operations in Haiti, and negatively affected the perceived legitimacy of the Haitian government.

Pathogens are not static; they exhibit rapid evolution in response to environmental conditions.

Examples of pathogens that thrive in these new sanitary ecologies are Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), etc. Thus, the GBD study, which held that infectious diseases would simply be eradicated, did not account for the genetic mutability of pathogens; their ability to colonize novel ecological niches within sanitized societies; or how much they impact health and healthcare cost.",

In the past decade, the use of genomic data to truly personalize care has become prominent. Since 2004, the US has focused on creating a complete personal health record for each citizen and developing technical standards to allow near-real-time health data acquisition from medical devices, health practitioners, caregivers, and/or patients themselves. Simulation technology combined with telemedicine empowers the generalist to provide care at the level of the specialist. EMRs, cell phones, and sensors empower the patient provider to care for him- or herself with the help of a nurse practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), or family member in their home or local clinic. Artificial intelligence can be designed into laboratory tests that tell the doctor when the test is complete, through the use of intelligent agents assigned to a laboratory test or imaging study. Smart robots exist that could help the patient conduct or interpret lab tests and other tasks in the home [24], and many more are in development. Emphasis is placed on the prevention of disease and living a healthy lifestyle. The network provides information and tracking that enables better prediction of disease pandemics, so that clinicians can intervene earlier. Patients can be treated remotely during disasters, when they are mobile, or traveling. This new web of care replaces the present system of centralized hospitals that is inefficient, expensive, and forces the patient to travel rather than receiving care in their location.",

Until recently, genomic sequencing was limited to a rather specific patient population, as the cost far outweighed the benefits for most patients. That has now changed with Illumina claiming to have the ability to sequence the genome for $1000 and the overall decrease in cost seen since the early 2000s [30, 31].

This data can then be used to predict health outcomes over time and predict trends of care. As a patient provider, each patient would be responsible for compiling his or her personal chart by utilizing wearable technology, which includes smartphones, tablets, and smart watches. The expectation would be that the patient and the provider act as a team to develop the best treatment possible. In the case of obesity, this could mean increasing daily fitness, decreasing caloric intake, or genetically modifying pre-existing DNA. Technology will play a vital role in enabling the patient to be a co-provider. By the year 2030, we expect mobile technology coupled with genomic information to shift the responsibility of care from the physician to the patient. Furthermore, we expect a major shift from treatment-based care to preventative care, with a subsequent dramatic reduction in the overall cost of health care.",

For example, obesity is a rising issue worldwide according to the GBD study, and we could lessen its impact by better educating the patient through frequent reminders on personal devices (such as a reminder to exercise or adjust diet according to daily intake) and the device transmitting patient performance data back to their provider. As of 2008, there were 1.48 billion overweight adults worldwide [1, 32]. The Cybercare goal is to shift focus from response-driven procedures such as bypass surgery towards healthy living. To achieve this goal of preventive care, the patient population will need to take on greater responsibility regarding their own health.

The law laid out five meaningful uses of an electronic record: quality, engagement of patients and families, improved care coordination, improved population health and public health, and privacy protection. Making health care digital and interoperable rapidly made distance irrelevant to practice. The act is currently in its second iteration of requirements and in 2015 is challenged to demonstrate improved outcomes [33]. The US Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 offers hope for near universal coverage and the emphasis on patient rights, access, affordability, and a coherent funding plan has seen millions of new insurance beneficiaries [34]. If the HITECH initiative made the EMR a prime tool for telemedicine, the ACA created a surge in demand for health care that exceeds capacity. The American Association of Medical Colleges predicts that by 2025, the US will have a shortfall of 25,000 to 50,000 physicians [29]. A shortfall of surgeons is also predicted by the Lancet 2030 article [35]. Task shifting can help to reduce this shortage of physicians by utilizing simulation and augmented reality technologies under Cybercare. The situation in nursing is even more dire. Instead of relying on nurses, a patient\u2019s family members, with proper training, could provide the necessary care. That implies no change in the established, long-revered practice pattern (called incident care) whereby a patient recognizes a problem, seeks a medical encounter, gets examined, and treated. Unfortunately we cannot staff medicine in the same way for what now is needed: the long-term management of chronic disease in an aging population. Fortunately, telemedicine\u2019s efficiency is essential in a new care pattern that will involve much work redesign and exquisite technology [29]. Telemedicine as a tool can provide affordable and accountable access.",

In public health, IT helps identify important patterns of behavior when used for disease prevention through syndromic biosurveillance for early warning and disease prevention [43]. Monitoring the health and wellness of a community through real-time data sets (such as their patterns of buying medical products) is a form of protection. The data sets come from sales of certain products in supermarkets and pharmacies (i.e., flu medicines for flu symptoms, anti-gas products for gastrointestinal issues) that are plotted in a Geographical Information System (see Fig. 3). Absenteeism of students from both private and public schools is then added into this plot to confirm that something (perhaps an outbreak of flu) is happening and where. It is important to note that in this case of syndromic surveillance, none of this data exists in the hospital or an emergency room since most people don\u2019t go to either place when they only have initial symptoms. Instead they purchase certain products depending on their symptoms. In addition to prevention and detection, IT may also enable rapid and accurate identification of the nature of an outbreak and aid in responding more quickly.",

While the number of new cases has flattened out since the peak early summer of 2015, the crisis continues nearly two years after it began. Many fault the WHO for its mismanagement of the crisis during its earlier stages. Had there been a more concerted international effort at the onset of the crisis we may not have seen such a dramatic increase in the total number of cases. It is important to note that many of the cases seen outside of West Africa were the result of healthcare workers returning to their country of origin. Cybercare could have tracked all of the cases and allowed a more timely response to the disease outbreak.",

Yet, placing an IV in an Ebola patient is very dangerous for a pandemic provider (personal quote, Tom Crabtree). We could have placed explosive ordnance robots at those hospitals as remote-controlled nurses. Robot nurses already exist [53].
