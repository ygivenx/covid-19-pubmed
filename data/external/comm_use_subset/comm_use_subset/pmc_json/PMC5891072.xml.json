The sequences can be identified by four tracts of two or more guanine bases that are separated by one or more nucleotides of varying composition. The sequences fold to form stacks of G-tetrads, planar structures composed of four guanine bases held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds (Fig 1) [1]. The stacked G-tetrads are connected by loops which vary in size and sequence composition. The number of G-tetrads, the loop lengths, and the loop sequence composition are all known to affect the stability of the folded structure, with higher numbers of G-tetrads and shorter loop lengths tending toward greater stability [2, 3].",

In Escherichia coli, G4 are capable of forming and altering expression levels [13], and in Neisseria gonorrhea, a G4 structure plays a critical role in antigenic variation [14]. Several G4 sequences have been identified in the promotor region of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) where ligand stabilization of a G4 located in the Nef gene reduced gene expression and repressed HIV-1 infectivity in an antiviral assay [15\u201321]. A G4 in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) altered the synthesis of EBNA1, a protein associated with processes involved in avoiding immune detection. Production of EBNA1 was reduced when the G4 was stabilized with a ligand and enhanced when destabilizing the G4 [22]. Recently, ligand stabilization of G4 in Herpes Simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) inhibited viral DNA replication [23]. G4 have also been detected in human papillomaviruses (HPV) [24], hepatitis C [25], Zika virus [26], and Ebola virus [27].",

This analysis was motivated by work in our laboratory suggesting the formation of a G4 during initial sequencing of one of three manatee papillomavirus genomes. Interestingly, the sequences creating difficulty were capable of forming only non-canonical structures with two G-tetrads. In our computational analysis, we found more potential structures comprised of two G-tetrads than was found in the previous study of G4 in HPV where researchers searched only for structures with three G-tetrads. In our biophysical analysis, we found that sequences in the E2 coding region where we encountered sequencing difficulty were capable of forming G4 with a parallel topology, and in fact, they appeared to be forming multiple two G-tetrad structures stacked upon one another. In the following paragraphs, we briefly describe the ecological relevance of G4 in papillomaviruses infecting manatees and provide evidence for the biological relevance of G4 with two G-tetrads to further justify extending our search to include these structures.",

Its population declined for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was that its gentle, slow-moving nature made it vulnerable to injury from boat propellers. Efforts at restoring the population have been successful to the extent that the species was downlisted to threatened status in 2016. However, in the midst of these efforts, animals undergoing rehabilitation frequently showed signs of high sensitivity to environmental stress, one sign being the development of cutaneous or mucosotropic genital papillomatous lesions. Some animals, both in captivity and in the wild, showed antibody titers indicating the presence or exposure to Trichechus manatus PV 1 (TmPV1), a virus first characterized in our laboratory [29\u201331]. More recently, genital lesions appeared in a single Florida manatee used as a surrogate animal for manatee rehabilitation at the Puerto Rico Manatee Conservation Center (PRMCC), and DNA sequencing, also performed in our laboratory, indicated the presence of two new PVs, Trichechus manatus PV 3 (TmPV3) and 4 (TmPV4) [31, 32]. These are the first known genital mucosotropic PVs in a manatee, presenting a novel sexually transmitted viral medical condition in this species should the virus spread in wild populations, where its presence is not currently known but suspected to occur naturally in the wild populations of the species throughout its range.",

Five genes encode non-structural or early proteins E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7, and two encode structural or late proteins L1 and L2, with all coding regions located on the forward DNA strand. A non-coding region holds the origin of replication and at least a couple of promotor sites. Much of what is known about the function of these sites comes from molecular biological research on human PVs [33]. E1 and E2 proteins form a complex that initiates viral replication at the origin, resulting in amplification of the virus. E2 also functions as a negative regulator of E6 and E7, two coding regions that stimulate cell growth and function as oncogenes in human PVs. The late proteins L1 and L2 code for the major and minor capsid proteins that enclose viral DNA, with E4 having a possible role in facilitating virion release.",

We reasoned this was possibly a G4, given that a GGA repeat would be a sequence pattern capable of G4 formation. It is important to note, however, that a GGA repeat would support the formation of a G4 with only two G-tetrads. Until recently, the vast majority of research on G4 has focused on sequence patterns capable of forming structures with three or more G-tetrads and loop lengths of one to seven bases. When Huppert and Balusubramanian (2005) first made a genome-wide search for G4 using computational means, they restricted their search to this pattern as a necessary constraint on a complex search task [34]. This was based on laboratory research indicating that this sequence pattern would produce structures of greater stability, but it was acknowledged that G4 could form from other sequence patterns. Nevertheless, over the years, research has largely focused on structures with three or more G-tetrads.",

In the studies of E. coli, HIV-1, and EBV mentioned earlier, sequences capable of only two G-tetrads formed secondary structures, and in E. coli and EBV, their formation altered expression levels. Furthermore, GGA repeat sequences are known to form intramolecular parallel G4 in the laboratory [35], and in a study of secondary structures formed from triplet repeat RNAs, AGG and UGG repeats also formed stable G4 [36]. In the human c-myb gene, a G4 formed from a GGA repeat sequence blocked transcription [37], and may serve as a negative regulator of gene expression [38]. It is also the case that formation of these structures can have useful clinical applications as seen with two thrombin binding aptamers shown to form two G-tetrad structures. These aptamers bind to different sites on the human thrombin protein, leading to inhibition of clot formation [39, 40].",

Structural conformation and thermal stability is dependent on loop length and composition as is seen with three G-tetrad structures. G4 with two G-tetrads, as well as other types of non-canonical structures, have also been identified using new high throughput sequencing methods, G4-seq and rG4-seq, which are the first genome- and transcriptome-wide methods for detecting formed, rather than predicted, secondary structures [42, 43]. Using G4-seq, Chambers et al. (2015) identified 58,020 two G-tetrad structures (11%) of 525,890 structures formed across the genome [42]. In a transcriptome-wide study of G4 formation with rG4-seq, Kwok et al. (2016) identified 639 two G-tetrad structures (16.6%) of 3,845 G4 structures formed [43].",

Multiple well-established methods were used as criteria for G4 formation, using accepted standards in the field. These methods include analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), circular dichroism (CD), thermal denaturation, and thioflavin T (ThT) binding. AUC is a venerable biophysical method that measures the absolute molecular weight (MW) and hydrodynamic shape (f/f0) of biomolecules. The frictional ratio f/f0 is the dimensionless ratio of the observed translational frictional coefficient to that of an equivalent spherical molecule of the same MW and density. It provides a measure of the asymmetry of the structure and shows definitively if a single-stranded oligonucleotide folds into a compact structure. The shape and amplitude of CD spectra provide characteristic signatures for the formation of G4 structures and for the number of G-tetrad stacks within a given structure. Thermal denaturation studies evaluate the stability of folded structures, and observed changes in CD spectra upon denaturation provide characteristic signatures for the transition from a folded G4 to an unstructured single strand. Finally, thioflavin T is a \u201clight up\u201d fluorescent probe for G4 formation. In the presence of known G4-forming sequences, a large increase in ThT fluorescence emission is observed, whereas in the presence of control duplexes and single strands, much lower emission intensity is seen. In addition to these accepted experimental criteria for G4 formation, molecular dynamics simulations were used to show that a plausible, stable, stereochemically feasible G4 can be constructed from the longest sequence studied, a structure that features two-tetrad G4 stacks.",

TmPV4-2 is more heterogeneous with both faster and slower sedimenting species, most likely arising from the formation of small amounts of aggregated and partially unfolded structures, respectively. The fastest sedimenting peak in Fig 4B near 3.8S has a molecular weight of 42.7 kDa, indicating the formation of a minor amount of a bimolecular structure. TmPV4-3 (Fig 4C) shows a homogeneous peak at 1.78S (MW = 7.18 kDa). The measured mass is twice the MW of the 11 nt oligonucleotide showing unambiguously that a bimolecular structure has formed.",

Each forms a predominant monomeric structure as judged by their molecular weights (Table 2), and their CD signatures are consistent with the formation of a parallel G4 structure (Fig 4E). However, the CD spectra also indicate a greater number of G-tetrads than would be found in a single two G-tetrad structure. While it is possible to fold the TmPV4-1 and TmPV4-2 strands into a variety of G4 conformations, we believe the simplest and most probable structures are ones that feature stacked G4 units, in which each unit is folded in a parallel conformation with two G-tetrads, as shown in Fig 5. The observed frictional ratios of 1.36 for TmPV4-1 and 1.58 for TmPV4-2 (Table 2) indicate nonspherical, slightly elongated, hydrodynamic structures, consistent with the shapes of these multiquadruplex structural models. The stacking interactions between G4 units in the proposed models yield contiguous G-tetrad stacks that are consistent with the amplitudes of the CD spectra in Fig 4E. Definitive proof of our proposed models requires independent verification by high-resolution structural methods, but these models are consistent with the available biophysical evidence.",

In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a G4 structure is essential to variation in the surface protein pilin, allowing the bacteria to evade detection by the host immune system [14]. The proposed mechanism involves transcription of an sRNA from the G4 site that base-pairs with the complementary location on the opposite DNA strand, separating the two strands and allowing the formation of the G4. The G4 secondary structures are known to be mutagenic [61], and in HIV-1 and HIV-2, mutated capsids are known to affect the ability of dendritic cells to detect the virus [62].",

Conversely, G4 destabilization can be achieved in the presence of a variety of helicases [72]. In terms of viral control, the focus has been on the therapeutic potential of G4-forming oligonucleotides, aptamers, and some success has been found in HIV [73], Hepatitis A [74], influenza virus [75], and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [76]. More recently, viral control has been achieved by identifying ligands for regulating naturally occurring G4 in HIV-1 [15, 17\u201319, 21], EBV [22, 77], and HSV-1[23]. Given the greater likelihood of sequences representing two G-tetrad structures, even if structures do not naturally form in vivo from these sequences, the potential for control through ligand stabilization exists. Indeed, in high-throughput sequencing identification of G4 secondary structures, the number of two G-tetrad structures increases relative to the number produced with a potassium environment when adding the G4 stabilizing ligand pyridostatin [42, 43].",

In longer sequences, these non-canonical, two G-tetrad structures appear capable of stacking as multiple G4 units. Distribution patterns that are indicative of G4 sequence conservation in specific coding regions support the notion that these structures regulate activities similar to those of G4 in other species. As regulatory structures, G4 offer potential drug targets for researchers interested in controlling disease processes. From an ecological perspective, given the threatened status of the Florida manatee and the concerns of scientists working to protect the health of this species, this research also provides an important first step in exploring the biological significance of these structures in this gentle aquatic mammal.",

To assess potential quadruplex formation, thioflavin T emission spectra were determined at 25 \u00b0C as described by de la Faverie et al. [55] with 0.5 \u03bcM thioflavin T (Sigma) and 1 \u03bcM oligodeoxynucleotide annealed in tBAP/1 mM EDTA/50 mM KCl, pH 7.0. Thioflavin T was excited at 412 nm (1 nm spectral band pass) and emission spectra were recorded from 420 to 620 nm (1 nm resolution, 2 nm spectral band pass) using a SpectraMax-3 fluorometer (Horiba Instruments, Edison, NJ). The integration time was 1 s and two spectra were averaged. The emission spectra were corrected by subtracting a buffer blank. The oligonucleotide 1XAV (a c-myc analog) was used as a positive control for fluorescence enhancement and its complementary (unfolded) DNA served as a negative control for non-specific fluorescence. The degree of fluorescence enhancement was calculated as the ratio of fluorescence intensities at the 488 nm emission maximum of the sample relative to the emission intensity of thioflavin T alone (F/F0).",

The four quadruplex sequences were defined as GGAGCAGGAGAAGGAGG, GGAGGAGGACGAGG, GGACGAGGAGGAGG, and GGAGGACGAGGAGG with potassium ions placed centrally between tetrads and stacks. Loop regions were added manually in a parallel (double chain reversal) orientation. Molecular dynamics was performed using the AMBER suite of software [86]. The ff14SB force field was used and the system was solvated in a rectilinear box of TIP3P water molecules with 15 \u00c5 buffers and neutralizing K+ ions were added to the system using standard Leap rules. The system was heated and equilibrated using the following protocol: (i) minimize water and ions holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5), (ii) 25 ps MD (heating to 100 K) holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5), (iii) repeat step (i), (iv) minimize all atoms, (v) 25 ps MD (heating to 300 K) holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5), (vi) 5 ns MD (T = 300 K) equilibration holding the DNA and tetrad coordinated potassium ions restrained (10 kcal/mol/\u00c5) to finish the equilibrium. A production run of 100 ns after the final equilibration step was carried out. Simulations were performed in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (P = 1 atm, T = 300 K) using sander and the GPU version of pmemd. Periodic boundary conditions and Particle-Mesh-Ewald algorithms were used. A 2.0 fs time step was used with bonds involving hydrogen atoms frozen using SHAKE.",
