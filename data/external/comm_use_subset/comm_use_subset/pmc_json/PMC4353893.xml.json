Given that healthcare demand outstrips available resources, the judicial use of resources through appropriate priority setting has been considered a key determinant of health system performance (Martin 2007). For example, it has been shown that a reallocation of 50% of the health budget from interventions that are less cost effective to those that are more cost effective could result in a 64% increase in years of life saved in the East African region (Bobadilla et al. 1994). In addition, the \u2018Tanzania Essential Health Intervention Project\u2019 suggested that targeted investments guided by proper prioritization resulted in a 40% reduction in child mortality in test districts (De Savigny et al. 2004).",

This is perhaps surprising given the critical role that hospitals play in the delivery of healthcare services and the observation that they absorb a significant portion of healthcare resources. For example, it has been observed that public hospitals absorb 30\u201350% of government budgetary allocations to the health sector in both developed and developing countries (Mills 1990; Martin et al. 2003a). Understanding how these hospitals set their priorities and the factors that influence their allocation of resources is therefore imperative. We conducted a thematic review of empirical literature on priority setting at the hospital (meso) level with the aim of describing what is known about priority setting practices and exploring the factors that influence this practice.",

Reference lists of selected papers were also manually searched for relevant papers. We limited the search to studies published in the English language that were available from January 1990 to December 2012. Next, we only included studies in the review if they reported empirical data on priority setting practice in hospitals. In this step, we initially screened study abstracts using these criteria and subsequently obtained full-text formats for studies deemed relevant. The final inclusion of studies in the review was based upon a detailed assessment of the full-text formats (studies for which no full-text format was available were excluded). All abstracts and full-text formats were reviewed independently by two authors. We then classified studies according to five general characteristics: (1) country (ies) where the studies were conducted, (2) study design, (3) priority setting activity and (4) study objectives.",

Each of the selected papers was imported to NVIVO version 10 software (QSR International) and coded using this thematic framework. Data were then lifted from their original context and rearranged according to the appropriate thematic reference and summarized in charts.

Burden of disease was also an important criteria in priority setting in hospitals in Canada (Kapiriri et al. 2007), Norway (Kapiriri et al. 2007), Chile (Valdebenito et al. 2009) and Argentina (Gordon et al. 2009). The rule of rescue also featured prominently whereby emergencies received high priority (Kapiriri et al. 2007). For health technology assessments and medicines selection, medical criteria included effectiveness, safety, ease of use and capacity of staff to employ the technology, patient benefits in terms of health outcomes and the nature of the technology/medicines. The latter was described in terms of whether it was a proven, new or investigational therapy. Proven therapies were often preferred.",

Informally, personal relationships and mutual benefit, lobbying, level of ambition and bargaining ability of departmental heads and political interests among actors often dominated priority setting decisions especially in developing countries (Kapiriri and Norheim 2004; Gordon et al. 2009). For example, in a hospital in Argentina, it was reported that allocations depended on whether the hospital managers and departmental heads enjoyed good relations and the potential for mutual benefit between them (Gordon et al. 2009). In addition, given that decision making was centralized, priorities were aligned to meet the political goals of local politicians rather than the health needs of the population (Gordon et al. 2009). In Uganda, even though the formal criteria of need determined that the paediatric department, which received almost 40% of the hospital emergencies, is given higher priority, the surgical department was given greater priority because of its perceived prestige, and because it had managers who were better at \u2018lobbying, making noise and quickly use up their resources\u2019 (Kapiriri and Martin 2006).",

This space can be formal (as defined by policies and regulations) and informal (choices exercised in practice but not formally defined) (Bossert 1998; Bossert and Beauvais 2002). The decision space for hospital level priority setting was influenced by the structure of the health system and the nature of the priority setting activity. For example, in countries such as Canada and Norway where the health system was significantly decentralized, hospitals had greater decision-making latitude (Kapiriri et al. 2007), while in Chile, a country with a less decentralized health system, priority setting at the hospital level was predominantly guided by national decisions with little discretion at the hospital level (Valdebenito et al. 2009). Hospitals generally had most discretion over decisions about medicines formularies and adopting new technologies compared to decisions about choice of programmes and allocations across programmes and departments.",

In Australia, for example, shrinking healthcare resources resulted in vigorous debate about the need for, ethics of and possible methods for cost containment and rationing of health services (Gallego et al. 2007). Increasing demand and reduced revenues also influenced the financing arrangements in hospitals. In Uganda, for example, an increasing budget deficit led to the capping of budgets and introduction of line budgeting which reduced the flexibility of priority setting (Kapiriri and Martin 2006). Budget caps for new medicines were also implemented in an Australian hospital to contain costs in the face of reducing resources (Bochner et al. 1994).",

This influence appeared to be in two forms (1) through the conditions associated with the financing sources and (2) through the incentives engendered by financing arrangements. For example, given that Chile has a mixed publicly and privately financed healthcare system, hospitals were required to employ guidelines that aligned their priorities to those prescribed by both systems (Valdebenito et al. 2009). Funding arrangements also generated incentives that influenced priority setting practice. Hospitals which were funded by a global budget were less willing to fund incremental use of new technology compared to hospitals funded under different models, such as fee for service (Sharma et al. 2006; Danjoux et al. 2007). Operating under line budgets reduced the flexibility of hospitals in choosing priorities and allocating resources across them (Kapiriri and Martin 2006). The introduction of budget caps also discouraged the adoption of new technologies as it required cutting allocations to hospital services (Sharma et al. 2006).",

The commitment of hospital leaders to implementing a fair and legitimate process was considered crucial to meeting the conditions of the ethical priority setting framework, AFR (Bell et al. 2004; Madden et al. 2005; Reeleder et al. 2005; Kapiriri and Martin 2006; Kapiriri et al. 2007; Gordon et al. 2009, Valdebenito et al. 2009). Within this framework the role of leadership seems to hinge on two points. First, the enforcement condition of A4R suggests that good leadership involves attention to the ethical aspects of priority setting. Second, leadership approaches describe a variety of values and behaviours which align with, and can be viewed as enablers for, A4R.",

Hospital decision makers generally lacked sufficient and reliable information for decision making (Gordon et al. 2009; Greenberg et al. 2009). The absence of quality data provided loopholes for the use of informal/subjective considerations in the priority setting process (Gordon et al. 2009). Lack of information also resulted in assessments being conducted after technologies had been adopted and widely used (Greenberg et al. 2009). Decision makers felt that the availability of quality information would improve the priority setting process (Martin et al. 2003a,b; Madden et al. 2005; Reeleder et al. 2005).",

Actors (stakeholders) in the priority setting process included national and regional health policy makers and planners, local politicians, donor organizations, community members, patients, hospital administrators/executives, hospital department heads and frontline practitioners (non-managerial clinical and non-clinical staff working directly with clients). The involvement of national and regional health policy makers was dependent on where the policy making authority was vested. In high-income countries such as Canada, where regional health authorities made policy, hospitals aligned their priorities with those of the regional health authorities (Kapiriri et al. 2007). In low- and middle-income countries such as Uganda and Chile, where policy making was done at the national level, the hospital priorities were aligned with national priorities (Kapiriri and Martin 2006; Valdebenito et al. 2009). Donor organizations influenced decision making in Uganda, a developing country setting, where resource scarcity was extreme (Kapiriri and Martin 2006).",

The minimal involvement of the community and patients was attributed to, among others, the perception that the community and patients lack understanding of medical issues and would represent a biased opinion by solely arguing for the merit of the particular interventions for which they were concerned (Martin et al. 2003b). Within the hospital, priority setting was dominated by hospital administrators/managers, with some settings reporting minimal involvement of frontline practitioners (Kapiriri and Martin 2006; Kapiriri et al. 2007). Reasons for the minimal involvement of practitioners included time constraints, and lack of interest (Kapiriri and Martin 2006). Power struggles between practitioners and managers who were reluctant to share decision-making power, and frustration by practitioners when their concerns were not addressed, also contributed to the non-participation of practitioners (Kapiriri and Martin 2006).",

            "text": "Other than the range of stakeholders involved, the power differences between these stakeholders had a major influence in the priority setting process in hospitals (Gibson et al. 2005). Power differences exist when some actors in the priority setting process have the capacity to influence priority setting outcomes more than others. This occurs given that hospital decision-making environments tend to be hierarchical and politically complex (Gibson et al. 2005). Power was derived from several sources. For example, actors with control over the budget had more power and hence influence over priority setting decisions (Gordon et al. 2009). The senior hospital managers exercised more power over decisions compared with other hospital managers and frontline practitioners by virtue of their position as senior managers (Gibson et al. 2005). For example, the hospital executive in a hospital in Argentina indicated that they did not need to consult the hospital management committee when requesting additional staff allocations (Gordon et al. 2009). A study of a hospital in Uganda reported power struggles between management and frontline workers, with managers reluctant to share decision-making responsibility. Actor power derived from possession of specialized skills and certain personal characteristics were also exercised (Gibson et al. 2005). For example, a study of decision making for a new surgical technology in Canada reported conflict between surgeons and radiologists over leadership of the process. There was also conflict between professional groups in hospitals (Astley and Wake-Dyster 2001; Haselkorn et al. 2007) leading to competitive and defensive rather than collaborative behaviour. A study in Canada reported that actors with greater persuasive skills had greater power to influence the planning process (Gibson et al. 2005).",

The lack of evidence or information to support formal reasons is also seen as a barrier by decision makers. Given that frontline staff and the public were often excluded, not all the relevant actors participated in the process. It was generally observed that the publicity condition was not met because while decisions were communicated, this communication was often only for the people that took part in decision making, thereby excluding other stakeholders such as frontline workers and/or the public. In addition, reasons/rationales for the decisions were not communicated. Of the 12 studies, only 4 reported the presence of a formal appeals mechanism, while the other 8 reported the presence of informal mechanisms where dissatisfied staff would seek redress directly with the hospital chief executive.

To our knowledge this is the first review of empirical studies on hospital level priority setting. Our review confirms that there is limited research attention given to priority setting at this level. Given that hospitals consume a significant proportion of health system resources, and act as avenues for delivery of key healthcare interventions, understanding how and where they put their resources is an important research and practice question. Another key observation is that most studies of priority setting in hospitals focused on developed country settings with few being conducted in developing countries. Most of the studies were conducted in tertiary, often teaching hospitals. Such hospitals are relatively large and act as referral hospitals. These hospitals are often semi-autonomous institutions whose management structures, operations, resources and target users are very different from lower level hospitals. There is, therefore, a gap in understanding how smaller, non-referral hospitals set their priorities and allocate their resources.",

Where case study methodology was not employed, quantitative surveys were used. These surveys were often limited to reporting frequencies against selected characteristics of priority setting and were unable to explore how and why the different aspects of priority setting interact and affect each other. There is perhaps a need to develop and employ mixed method approaches in the study of priority setting. For example, while qualitative methods were particularly good at eliciting the criteria used in setting priorities, they were unable to determine the relative importance of these criteria. Application of priority setting criteria implies trade-offs between competing criteria. Determining the relative importance of priority setting criteria is, therefore, an important ingredient in systematic priority setting processes. There are a number of quantitative methodologies that can be employed to elicit preferences for priority setting criteria, ranging from simple rating and ranking scales, self-explication methodology and choice experiments, to more complex discrete choice experiments (Ryan et al. 2001; Pavlova et al. 2003; Baltussen and Niessen 2006).",

            "text": "All but one of the studies that sought to evaluate priority setting employed the AFR framework. This is an ethical framework developed by Daniels and Sabin that aims to be \u2018a practical, yet theoretically defensible, account of how societies should set limits to and priorities for health care\u2019 (Eddy 1991). The framework argues for a focus on the \u2018process\u2019, rather than the \u2018outcome\u2019 of priority setting, given the lack of consensus about universal criteria. AFR proposes that the goal of priority setting should be fairness and legitimacy. The studies captured in this review, therefore, endeavoured to evaluate priority setting processes against the four conditions of AFR such as relevance, publicity, appeals and revision and enforcement. The \u2018publicity\u2019 criterion holds that resource allocation decisions must be public, including the grounds for making them. The criteria for \u2018relevance\u2019 require that the basis on which allocative decisions are made must be ones that \u2018fair-minded people can agree are relevant to meeting the healthcare needs fairly under reasonable constraint\u2019 (Daniels and Sabin 1997). Arguments should rest on scientific evidence, though not necessarily a specific kind of evidence (Daniels and Sabin 1998). The \u2018revisions and appeals\u2019 process criterion requires that there is an institutional mechanism that provides for channels for appeals to decisions and subsequent revisions of decisions in light of further arguments. The \u2018enforcement\u2019 criterion requires that some form of regulation exists to make sure that the first three conditions are met (Daniels 2008). While a focus on the fairness and legitimacy of priority setting processes is indisputably important, understanding what substantive principles are employed in priority setting and how they are operationalized in local context is equally important. For example, do hospitals allocate their resources across services according to severity of disease or efficiency? And how do they define and specify these principles? While this distinction between substantive and procedural approaches to priority setting suggests that the two are incompatible, there is increasing consensus on the need to combine these approaches (Ham and Coulter 2000; Ruger 2004; Kamm 2005). There is, therefore, a need to develop approaches that combine the use of substantive principles that are widely accepted with fair processes.",

            "text": "Most of the studies were inspired by a framework proposed by Martin and Singer (2003) which recommends a strategy for improving priority setting that involves (1) describing priority setting in the context where it occurs, (2) evaluating the description using an ethical framework and (3) improving priority setting based on the evaluation. In elaborating this approach, they argue that any sustainable strategy to improve priority setting must be built on a continuous learning platform that, at the very least, captures how priority setting decisions are actually made (Martin and Singer 2003). This, they argue would necessitate a description of the priority setting contexts, processes and actors involved. Our review highlights a range of factors influencing priority setting in these institutions regarding context (e.g. financing arrangements, leadership, organizational culture, level of resourcing and demand for health care), process (e.g. procedures and tools used) and content (e.g. guidelines and criteria of priority setting) as well as the importance of the interests and influence of the key actors involved in the process. Some critical aspects of priority setting appear to have been neglected by the studies reviewed, however. For example, while contextual issues such as financing arrangements and decision-making capacity of managers are arguably important in priority setting processes, these were at best minimally explored. Also given that priority setting is a social process with a range of actors, the power relationships between these actors and how these influence the process warrant a more in-depth examination.",

This made it easier to determine what to look for in the papers, organize the extracted data and structure the synthesis of findings. On the basis of the review and drawing on policy analysis frameworks (Walt and Gilson 1994; Buse 2007; Gilson and Raphaely 2008), we propose that studies that aim to analyse priority setting practices use a health policy lens. Future research that aims to examine priority setting would benefit from carefully considering four interrelated areas (Figure 2):\nContext: What contextual issues influence the priority setting processes? This would include issues such as health system structure, political arrangements, financial and economic factors, capacity of decision makers, nature and level of demand for healthcare services, decision space and organizational culture.Content: What priority setting guidelines are in place, and what criteria are used to allocate resources?Process: What are the procedures and tools hospitals should use to set priorities? Are these procedures and tools used? If not why?Actors: Who are the relevant internal and external actors involved in the priority setting process? What are their roles, interests, level of influence and power relations? How does this influence priority setting practice?\n",

There is, however, a dearth of literature on priority setting in hospitals in developing countries and in particular little attention has been paid to lower level hospitals as opposed to larger, referral hospitals. Most priority setting studies employed a qualitative case study methodology, a suitable approach for examining complex social phenomena that are often highly embedded in context. However, broader approaches that include mixed methods should also be considered. Our review identified a range of factors that affect priority setting practice in hospitals. These factors provide potential policy levers that could be used to influence priority setting processes. We have also proposed a framework that, in our view, could be useful in examining priority setting processes and potentially informing the design of system interventions to influence priority setting at the meso level in hospitals. In increasingly devolved systems greater attention to the practice and consequences of priority setting are required to promote accountability, efficiency, effectiveness and equity.",
