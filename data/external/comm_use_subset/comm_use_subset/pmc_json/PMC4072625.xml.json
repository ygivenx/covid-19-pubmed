In accordance with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, YPFS is frequently being used to treat colds, flus and inflammation-associated diseases. Clinically, YPFS has been shown to produce beneficial immune-modulatory effects of preventing bacterial and viral infections. Recent studies revealed that YPFS exerts antiviral effects including effects against influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [1]\u2013[5], as well as curative effects in inflammation-associated diseases including allergic rhinitis [6], [7] and asthma [8].",

By contrast, YPFS suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic inflammation model [9]. Interestingly, a duality of YPFS in modulating the expression of immunoglobulins has also been revealed in animal studies; YPFS stimulated the production of immunoglobulin after antigens were directly injected into the body, whereas YPFS suppressed immunoglobulin production when external antigens were infused in the nasal mucus [7].",

            "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex group of inflammation-associated diseases involving alterations in mucosal immunity and gastrointestinal physiology. Macrophages express numerous inflammatory mediators including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and both of these enzymes play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic inflammation, for example in IBD [10]\u2013[11]. The signaling messengers, NO and prostaglandins, produced by iNOS and COX-2, respectively, are required for these functions, including mucosal defense, gastric acid production, protection of epithelial cells, recruitment of leukocytes to the mucosa, release of inflammatory mediators, and vasodilation of gastric mucosa [12]\u2013[17]. Several lines of evidence indicate that a reduction in the levels of NO and prostaglandins, which results from diminished expression of iNOS and COX-2, might lead to the damage of gastrointestinal system [18], [19]. Conversely, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IALP), a small intestinal brush-border enzyme that provides resistance to bacterial invasion, functions as a gut mucosal defense factor [20]. Indeed, a reduced expression of IALP in IBD patients was shown to be closely correlated with gut inflammation [21], [22].",

We determined the inhibitory effects of YPFS on expression of iNOS in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. As expected, LPS activated expression of iNOS (\nFig. 1\n). However, when the cells were treated with YPFS for 3 hours before applying LPS, the expression of iNOS mRNA was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, having a maximal effect of \u223c40% inhibition (\nFig. 1A\n). Next, the inhibitory effects of individual herbs were determined. The extracts of AR and AMR suppressed iNOS expression by nearly 60%, whereas SR extract exhibited only a mild suppressive effect (\u223c10%) (\nFig. 1B\n). The positive control used here was dexamethasone (\n\nFig. 1B\n\n). In the background, the iNOS protein was barely detectable in macrophages (\nFig. 1C and 1D\n), and the treatment with LPS potently induced iNOS expression (\nFig. 1C\n). However, the addition of YPFS, as well as of single herbal extracts, down regulated LPS-induced iNOS protein level similarly, as in the case of mRNA expression, although a slightly larger effect was observed (\nFig. 1C and 1E\n). Moreover, the suppression of iNOS expression by YPFS was in a dose-dependent manner (\nFig. 1D\n).",

As in the case of iNOS, the COX-2 protein was undetectable under the untreated conditions (\nFig. 2C\n), but which was stimulated by LPS. Treatment with AR and AMR extracts suppressed, relative to control, LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA by nearly 55% (\nFig. 2B\n) and COX-2 protein by \u223c60% (\nFig. 2E\n). Moreover, treating LPS-stimulated macrophages with SR led to \u223c18% and \u223c30% reductions in expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, respectively (\nFig. 2B, 2C, and 2E\n). Dexamethasone again served as a positive control.",

IBD is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, the pathogenesis of which is manifested as complex and multifactorial processes, and which is classified as autoimmune disorder. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective anti-inflammatory agents that are widely used to treat inflammation-associated diseases. However, using NSAIDs to inhibit the expression of iNOS and COX-2 can lead to severe gastrointestinal damage [19]. Thus, NSAIDs is avoided for the treatment of IBD. Searching for effective drugs is urgent needed for the drug development of therapy and prevention of IBD. Excessive iNOS and COX-2 expression is associated with various forms of gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation, whereas low levels of iNOS and COX-2 have been reported to play protective roles in IBD [16], [28]\u2013[30]. Thus, to investigate the mechanism by which YPFS functions, we evaluated the duality of YPFS in modulating the expression of iNOS and COX-2. In activated or non-activated macrophages, YPFS could play a modulatory role in balancing the expression of iNOS and COX-2. The regulation of these enzymes might offer a means by which YPFS could be used as a suitable therapeutic approach to treat IBD, in particularly, when the intake of anti-inflammatory agents NSAIDs cannot be avoided.",

Moreover, an AMR-derived glycoprotein was shown to markedly stimulate the production of TNF\u03b1 in splenocytes [9], [32], whereas AMR-derived atractylenolide I and III were shown to exert anti-inflammation effects by suppressing LPS-induced expression of TNF\u03b1 in cultured macrophages [9], [33].

            "text": "To understand the mechanism underlying the duality of YPFS in regulating immune responses, we investigated the effects of YPFS in the IL-10 anti-inflammatory signaling pathway. Although YPFS activated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophages after treatment for 24 hours, YPFS suppressed IL-10 expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the anti-inflammatory effects of YPFS might not be mediated through the IL-10 pathway (Du et al., unpublished data). The mechanism responsible for the dual role played by YPFS-induced signaling in the immune system thus remains unknown, but studies on ursolic acid could offer valuable clues. Ursolic acid, a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acid, exhibits contrasting anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro and in vivo\n[36]\u2013[40] effects that are similar to those of YPFS. However, only limited in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted on the mechanisms of ursolic acid action. Thus, further investigation into the mechanistic underpinnings of the duality YPFS action in modulating immune functions should provide new insights into this property. More importantly, the mechanism responsible for this dual effect of YPFS must be studied comprehensively to determine the risks and benefits of clinically administering this herbal decoction.",
