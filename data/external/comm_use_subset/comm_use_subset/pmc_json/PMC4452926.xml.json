Compared with other diagnostic techniques, ns-EM excels in speed and \u201copen view\u201d, the ability to detect the \u201cunexpected\u201d without the need for specific reagents [1]. Therefore, ns-EM methods are very useful for identifying the causal agents as viruses when we are confronted with rare infections and new viruses, as well as for viral infections in minor species and wild animals, when no other standardized methods and/or diagnostic reagents are available [2,3,4].",

The dilution is optimal when the immunoaggregates are of adequate size, the halo of antibodies around the virions is not too thick and the virion\u2019s morphology is not altered. To ascertain the optimal dilution, one sample is tested using serial dilutions of the pooled convalescent sera. Initially, 1:2, 1:20, 1:200 and 1:1000 dilutions in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) are tested, and then, based on the results obtained, appropriate intermediate dilutions (1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, etc.) are used.

The adapters are almost identical to those provided in the past by Beckman. They are made of Plexiglas and shaped to fit perfectly into the tubes. The 3-mm grids are put in a slot obtained on the face of the adapter which has a slant cut with the same angle of the rotor (18\u00b0) in order to permit direct pelleting of particles on their surface.

Both negative control sera were used at fixed dilutions of 1:5 and 1:50. Basically, the use of controls at fixed dilutions is a compromise. In the execution of routine diagnostic IAEM tests, negative controls are used with the aim of excluding spontaneous aggregations of virions. The assumption is that both of the employed negative sera will not aggregate all of the virions potentially present in the sample. Therefore, their use at fixed dilutions is conventionally accepted because it is not the intent to detect and evaluate real differences in the levels of binding. They can, therefore, be considered as qualitative and not quantitative controls.",

They have a steady incidence in pig commercial farms and can sporadically cause enteritis outbreaks with increased mortality rates. The disease may be complicated by other pathogens, including enteric viruses, some of which have only recently been discovered, and with undefined pathogenic viruses, such as calicivirus [9,10,11], enterovirus, teschovirus, astrovirus [10], parvovirus, sapovirus [12], norovirus, bocavirus and kobuvirus.",

The detection of non-A, atypical RVs can be difficult due to the usually lower intestinal load, the lack of specific reagents for immune-enzymatic tests, and the fact that characteristic single\u2014and double\u2014shelled particles may not be readily apparent during ns-EM observation [13]. Using IAEM with convalescent sera makes it possible to detect different PoRVs (Figure 1A\u2013D), including those strains belonging to non-A RV groups, which are non-cultivable and not recognized by immuno-enzymatic tests based on Group-A reagents. Actually, only PCR amplification of targeted sequences using Group-specific oligonucleotide primers, followed by nucleotide sequencing, provides an alternative tool to identify non-Group-A RVs [11]. In addition, IAEM with convalescent sera more easily detects other viral agents, present in association with RVs, among which, in our experience [14], small round fecal virus/enterovirus-like particles are the most frequently present (Table 1). An example of a mixed infection in which RVs are associated with unclassified, 28\u201330 nm roundish particles, is shown in Figure 1C,E). IAEM negative control showing several rotavirus particles dispersed in the observation field is reported in Figure 1F.",

Rotavirus (12%) and PED coronaviruses (18.7%) represented the most common viral agents. Other agents included circovirus (4.6%), enterovirus (1.4%), calicivirus (0.5%), adenovirus (0.1%), parvovirus (0.1%), torovirus (0.1%) and small round fecal viruses/enterovirus-like viruses (14.4%), which were not fully classified due to their undefined morphology [14]. Therefore, to improve the knowledge of unclassified enterovirus-like particles, a total of 40 viral isolates were further identified by sequencing the capsid VP1-encoding gene. This lead to their classification as porcine enterovirus, porcine teschovirus and porcine sapelovirus [15].",

PCV2 has an immuno-suppressive effect and, thus, it is often detected in association with other viral and bacterial agents. Thus, the use of IAEM with convalescent sera is useful for more readily identifying multiple viral infections in which PCV2 is associated with other viruses. In fact, in one study [18] we used IAEM with anti-PCV2 convalescent sera to examine 101 animals taken from 29 industrial farms where outbreaks of PMWS were reported or lesions typical of PMWS were regularly shown at necropsy. Prior to being used in the IAEM method, the convalescent serum used was determined to be positive (titer 1:10,000) for anti-PCRV2 antibodies by testing in an in-home MAb-based competitive serological ELISA test [19]. Forty-five samples tested positive for PCV2, and it was frequently observed in association with one or more other viruses (Table 2). Examples of the association of circovirus particles with other virions, and particularly with rotavirus and enterovirus-like virus particles, are respectively reported in Figure 2A,B.",

The results confirmed the lower sensitivity of IAEM compared with PCR (concordance 44.1%) but not compared with IF (concordance 64.7%). By performing a single IAEM test, different associating particles, such as parvovirus-like, enterovirus-like, rotaviruses and PEDV, were simultaneously observed, thus more data were acquired on the interactions between PCV2 and other pathogens potentially involved in the pathogenesis of PMWS syndrome. Indeed, a higher level of PCV2 particles were detected in the caecum in comparison with the small intestine, and in several occasions only the caecum contained circovirus particles [20].",

Two immunoassays, based on MAbs produced against the European CV777 reference strain were established for the detection of both antigen (double antibody sandwich ELISA) [25] and antibodies (MAb-based antigen capture ELISA) [26]. To confirm the virological identification we used reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), as described by Kim et al. [27] that employs primers targeting the S gene [25].

Using IAEM and sandwich ELISAs, 73 PEDV cases, from 60 different farms, out of 1756 cases of enteritis (4.54%) were diagnosed, and 28 strains were further genetically analyzed [28].",

In turkey, RVs are often associated with astrovirus (AstV) [31] and cause, with a synergistic effect, clinical enteritis ranging from subclinical to severe [32]. Because of the antigenic variability of turkey RVs, which belong to different groups (A, D, F, and G), the inability to cultivate in vitro both AstV and non-A RVs, and the scarcity of established molecular techniques, EM methods are still useful to quickly achieve a diagnosis of viral enteritis. In particular, IAEM with convalescent sera could simplify and improve viral detection of RVs and AstVs by concentrating and increasing the number of visible particles through their aggregation to form immunocomplexes. Thus, IAEM with convalescent sera has been extensively used for diagnostic examinations of viral enteric infections.",

All of the birds sampled were between 1 and 5 weeks old and were suffering from systemic and enteric symptoms characterized by growth retardation, lethargy, anorexia, dehydration, wet droppings and/or diarrhea, which led to weight loss, decreased flock uniformity and increased mortality. A pool of sera, taken three weeks after a clinical episode of enteritis caused by RVs and AstVs, was obtained from convalescent turkeys and used to perform IAEM. The results are reported in Table 3. Viral particles were observed in 51.4% of the examined samples and rotavirus (26.6%) and astrovirus (25.8%) mostly clumped in medium-large aggregates, were the most frequently detected particles (Figure 5A). The presence of antibody halos did not hamper the identification of virions, particularly of rotavirus, which, at the serum dilution used, were mostly showing a typical morphology (Figure 5B). AstVs were identified when the 28\u201330 nm picornavirus-like icosahedral particles displayed the characteristic 5\u20136 pointed star-shaped surface. However, since the typical star-shaped configuration is usually visible in only approximately 10%\u201320% of the particles [34], and it may sometimes be obscured by antibodies when examining stools by IAEM [35], we classified particles of this size-class as AstV if they showed a somehow structured surface (Figure 5C).",

We then sequenced and genetically analyzed the RT-PCR positive samples, and we performed a phylogenetic analysis to distinguish and type them [37]. This study also permitted us to compare the results obtained by the two diagnostic methods (RT-PCR vs. ns-EM) and to draw some conclusions regarding their respective advantages and disadvantages. ns-EM was confirmed as a very useful method for an initial diagnosis of viral enteritis and for the identification and screening of RVs, SRVs, AstVs and ELVs in avian intestinal and fecal samples because it is fast, can identify viruses that cannot be isolated or identified using other methods, and is also able to distinguish mixed infections and particles that are unable to replicate. Nevertheless, it is only sensitive enough to identify the viral particles when the clinical symptoms of enteritis are present, and it does not allow for the further discrimination and characterization of similar viruses, which require the combined use of PCR and sequencing. Based on these conclusions, presently, in routine laboratory procedures, all of the samples from turkey pullets showing enteritis are examined using IAEM with a 1:40 dilution of the original convalescent sera. Samples are simultaneously subjected to RT-PCR to identify the RV and define the Group (A, D, F or G) [38], as well as to identify and type the AstV [37].",

In fact, we observed compact groups of a variable number of viral units, surrounded by a dense halo of antibodies (Figure 8A) in most of the samples taken from animals showing typical signs and lesions [44,45]. By using both the anti-RHDV convalescent sera (Figure 9A) and homologous convalescent hare sera (Figure 9B) for IAEM examinations of liver homogenates of EBHS affected hares, we were able to identify the viral etiological agent (EBHSV) [45,46].",
