            "text": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs), characterized by Foxp3 expression, have critical roles in suppressing pro-inflammatory immune responses, with ameliorating effects in autoimmune disease and deleterious consequences in the context of tumor clearance [1]. Tregs are also critical for the resolution of immune responses against pathogens. They are required for entry of immune cells into sites of inflammation in some viral infections [2], [3]. Additionally, in chronic viral infections, such as those caused by HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, Friend virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), Tregs contribute to pathogen persistence [4]. On the other hand, in acute viral infections caused by pathogens that include West Nile virus (WNV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Tregs ameliorate acute disease [5]\u2013[7]. If Tregs are depleted from mice infected with HSV or MHV, clinical disease is more severe [8], [9].",

Further, these Tregs originate from thymus-derived pools, and are generally not generated by peripheral conversion from pathogen-specific effector CD4 T cell populations [10], [12], [13], [15], with the exception of Tregs specific for gut pathogens [16]. Studies of autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, showed that adoptively transferred Tregs specific for an epitope at a site of inflammation were more suppressive than bulk populations of Tregs [17], [18]. Tregs specific for a M. tuberculosis (Mtb) CD4 T cell epitope are more suppressive than those that recognize a non-Mtb CD4 T cell epitope [19]. However, whether pathogen-specific Tregs are more potent than bulk populations of Tregs obtained from wild type mice has not been addressed in any infectious setting.",

            "text": "Mice infected with neurotropic strains of MHV develop acute encephalitis or acute and chronic demyelinating diseases [20]. Tregs are required to diminish immune-mediated disease in these mice. Thus, Treg depletion converted a nonlethal encephalitis to one with high mortality while transfer of bulk populations of Tregs to mice infected with a virulent strain of MHV prevented a lethal outcome [8]. In addition, transfer of na\u00efve bulk populations of Tregs along with MHV-immune effector T cells to infected RAG1\u2212/\u2212 (Recombination Activation Gene1\u2212/\u2212) mice resulted in less severe clinical disease and diminished cell infiltration when compared to mice that received only effector T cells [7]. More recently, we identified Tregs that recognized the immunodominant CD4 T cell epitope (M133) in the brains of mice infected with the neuroattenuated rJ2.2 strain of MHV as well as in the T cell precursor pool of na\u00efve mice [12]. Tregs at sites of inflammation adapt to the milieu by expressing transcription factors such as T-bet (Th1-type), STAT-3 (Th17-type) or IRF4 (Th2-type) [21] and as expected, brain-derived M133-specific Tregs in infected mice expressed T-bet. T-bet-mediated expression of CXCR3 is necessary for Treg migration to inflamed tissues [22]. These cells expressed cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF, in addition to IL-10 when stimulated with M133 peptide directly ex vivo. Further, we showed that IFN-\u03b3 production was not an in vitro phenomenon since IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tregs was detected directly ex vivo in the absence of peptide stimulation if mice were treated with brefeldin A prior to sacrifice [12].",

Addressing these questions directly in wild type mice is difficult because M133-specific Tregs comprise only a small fraction of total Tregs. To circumvent this problem, we developed a mouse transgenic for the expression of an M133-specific T cell receptor [23] and used Tregs (M133 Tregs) from these mice in the current study. The results show that Tregs function both in the draining lymph nodes (deep cervical lymph nodes, DCLN, and to a lesser extent, superficial cervical lymph nodes, CLN) and in the brain to ameliorate encephalitis severity.",

However, adoptively transferred bulk populations of splenic C57BL/6 (B6) Tregs (bulk Tregs) were minimally detected in the infected central nervous system (CNS) [7]. To reconcile these disparate results, we co-transferred bulk Tregs and M133 Tregs derived from uninfected Foxp3gfp and M133 Tg-Foxp3gfp mice, respectively. Approximately 0.5\u20131% of the CD4 T cells in the blood of M133 Tg mice expressed Foxp3; 50% of Foxp3+ and >97% of Foxp3\u2212CD4 T cells (Tconv) bound I-Ab/M133 tetramer (\nFigure 1A\n). Equal numbers of Violet-labeled bulk and M133 Tregs were transferred to B6 mice, some of which were infected with rJ2.2 24 hours later (\nFigure 1B\n). Tregs were identified in the lymphoid tissues of infected and uninfected recipient mice seven days after infection, using the gating strategy shown in \nFigure 1C\n. Equal numbers of bulk and M133 Tregs were detected in the spleen, cervical and deep cervical lymph nodes (CLN, DCLN) of uninfected mice and neither population proliferated substantially. In contrast, after infection, M133 but not bulk Tregs proliferated extensively in all three peripheral lymphoid tissues. Further, only M133 Tregs entered the infected brain to a detectable extent (\nFigure 1D\n). By day 7 post infection (p.i.), the ratio of M133 to bulk Tregs ranged from 10\u22361 in lymphoid tissue to greater than 1000\u22361 in the brain (\nFigure 1E\n). In addition to exhibiting less proliferation, transferred bulk Tregs in the DCLN were less activated when assessed by measuring expression of CD25, CTLA-4, CXCR3 and ICOS at day 4 p.i.

Mice were sacrificed at days 3, 4 and 5 p.i. and analyzed for CFSE dilution (indicative of cell division) and for CXCR3 expression (required for T cell migration to the inflamed brain [24]) by M133 Tconv in the spleen, CLN, DCLN, inguinal lymph nodes (ILN) and brain. CFSE dilution occurred initially in the DCLN (\nFigure 2, B and C\n). Expression of CXCR3 was upregulated within 1\u20132 rounds of proliferation (\nFigure 2B\n). By day 4 p.i., M133 Tconv accounted for 10% of all CD4 T cells in the DCLN, a frequency higher than in any other lymphoid tissues that were examined (\nFigure 2D\n). While the numbers of M133 Tconvs decreased dramatically between days 4 and 5 p.i. in the DCLN (\nFigure 2E\n), they continued to increase in other lymphoid tissues. These results suggested that M133 Tconvs were primed in the DCLN and migrated to other sites. By day 5, cells that had undergone varying numbers of divisions were detected in all tissues except the brain, where only highly divided cells (complete loss of CFSE labeling) were present.",

This resulted in a 1\u22361 ratio because only 50% of Tregs were M133-specific (\nFigure 1A\n). Cells were analyzed at days 2\u20134 instead of days 3\u20135 to capture early cell proliferation, since we had observed substantial proliferation of Tconv in the DCLN by day 3 p.i. when only Tconv were transferred (\nFigure 2B\n). By day 2 p.i, we observed five generations (4 divisions) of Violet-labeled Tconv in the DCLN but not other tissues. In contrast, Treg proliferation was not detected until day 3 p.i. with Violet dilution occurring initially in the DCLN (\nFigure 3B\n). By day 4 p.i., M133 Tconv and Tregs that had undergone extensive division were detected in the DCLN and CLN, with Tconv proliferation occurring to a greater extent than that of Tregs. This resulted in a dramatic increase in the ratio of Tconv to Tregs from day 3 to 4 p.i. in the DCLN and CLN (\nFigure 3C\n). Of note, only very few M133 CD4 T cells entered the brain at days 3 or 4 p.i., but remarkably, the majority of these cells were Tregs (\nFigure 3D\n). Tregs were able to enter the brain after fewer cycles of proliferation when compared to Tconv (\nFigure 3D\n\nand\n\n4B\n). Exposure to M133 antigen was required for proliferation because neither M133 Tconv nor M133 Treg proliferated in mice infected with a rJ2.2 mutant (rJ2.2.MY135Q) in which epitope M133 expression was abrogated (\nFigure 3E\n).

In these experiments, equal numbers of M133 Tconv and Tregs were transferred to B6 mice and mice were treated with the drug 0.5 hr prior to infection and then on a daily basis (\nFigure 4A\n). Proliferating M133 Tconv or Tregs were barely detectable in the spleen or ILN after FTY720 treatment at day 4 p.i., but proliferation continued unabated in the DCLN and to a lesser extent, in the CLN. No transferred cells were detected in the brain after drug treatment (\nFigure 4, B and C\n). Further, only highly divided cells were detected in the DCLN in treated mice whereas in the absence of FTY720, cells with only partial dye dilution were detected, suggesting that the latter were newly recruited.

Equivalent levels of CD25 and CD69 were detected on undivided M133 Tconv. However, even though expression of CD25 and CD69 followed similar kinetics in the presence or absence of Tregs, levels of both molecules were lower in the presence of Tregs after cells began to divide. These results suggest that the initial activation of M133 Tconv was not affected by the presence of Tregs, perhaps because of the lag in Treg relative to Tconv activation, shown in Figure 3. However, as M133 Tregs became activated and proliferated, they functioned to downregulate both molecules on Tconv. Of note, CD69 levels were lower on M133 Tregs than on M133 Tconv in mice that received both types of cells, while, as expected, CD25 levels were higher on M133 Tregs (\nFigure 6B\n, blue bars).",

The effect of Tregs on proliferation is most likely even greater than shown in the figure because a limitation of this assay is that dye dilution cannot be detected beyond 9 divisions. Remarkably, at day 3 p.i., Tconv that had undergone more divisions were detected in the presence of Tregs, resulting in a higher expansion index (EI) (\nFigure 6C\n). Of note, only the EI in the DCLN at day 3 p.i. is shown because the EI cannot be calculated when there are too few cells in the parent generation (DCLN and spleen at days 4 and 5 p.i.) or too few proliferated cells (spleen at day 3 in the presence of M133 Tregs). Further, Tconv numbers in the DCLN decreased from day 4 to day 5 when transferred alone, indicating significant cell egress, while numbers of these cells continued to increase in the presence of M133 Tregs (\nFig. 5B\n). These results, in conjunction with decreased Tconv numbers in the spleen and brain at all times in the presence of M133 Tregs (\nFigure 5B\n\nand\n\n6C\n), suggest that Tregs inhibited egress from the DCLN in addition to effects on proliferation. Of note, decreased Tconv numbers could reflect increased levels of apoptosis, but the fraction of Tconv apoptosis was the same in the presence or absence of transferred M133 Tregs in the DCLN at day 4 (\nFigure 6D\n).",

CXCR3 transcription is regulated by T-bet [26]; consistent with this, T-bet expression in Tconv was less elevated in the presence of transferred Tregs (\nFigure 6E\n). Thus, in the DCLN, M133 Tconv accumulation was determined by a balance of opposing effects on migration and proliferation, while in the spleen and brain, both effects contributed to decreased numbers of Tconv.

We transferred either M133 Tconv or Treg into mice prior to rJ2.2 infection and measured T-bet and cytokine expression in the DCLN at day 3.5 p.i. (\nFigure 7\n). T-bet was expressed by both types of cells at this early time post infection, after either one (Tconv) or three (Treg) cell divisions. Further, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 were expressed by both M133 Tconv and Tregs in the DCLN after direct ex vivo stimulation with M133 peptide. Tregs required more cell divisions to express IFN-\u03b3 than Tconv but conversely, IL-10 expression by Tregs occurred after fewer cell divisions than Tconv. Thus, Treg ability to express cytokines did not require entry into the infected brain, but rather the milieu in the draining DCLN was sufficient to trigger differentiation. These cells then migrated to the infected brain, already competent for cytokine expression.",

Since these cells had been activated in vivo, M133 Tregs, isolated from uninfected M133 TCR Tg mice were therefore pre-activated in vitro with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. In all cases, M133 peptide was included in the in vitro suppression assay to activate M133 Tregs. Consequently, in order to distinguish proliferation of M133 and S358 CD4 or S510 CD8 T cells, the latter cells were obtained from mice infected with virus lacking expression of the M133 epitope (rJ2.2.MY135Q). As shown in Figure 9B and C, M133 Tregs preferentially suppressed the proliferation of M133 Tconv. In agreement with the results shown in Figure 8E and our previous results [27], M133 Tregs inhibited the proliferation of S358-specific CD4 T cells more potently than that of S510-specific CD8 T cells.",

Here we extend these results to mice with coronavirus-induced encephalitis and show that Tregs specific for a virus-specific CD4 T cell epitope are highly activated and protective. M133 Tregs proliferate, express cytokines, particularly the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, and suppress M133 Tconv proliferation in the DCLN. Further, they inhibit Tconv migration from the site of priming, the DCLN. After transfer to rJ2.2-infected mice, M133 Tregs increase survival and decrease weight loss when compared to bulk populations of Tregs and decrease numbers and effector function of virus-specific CD4 T cells in the brain. Many of these effects reflect Treg function in the DCLN, but additionally, microglia activation in the brain was diminished after M133 Treg transfer. We showed previously that large numbers of bulk Tregs could tamper the immune response in the infected brain, by causing a dimunition in total numbers of infiltrating cells, without affecting the cellular composition [7]. However, the use of virus epitope-specific Tregs allowed for a targeted immune response with effects primarily on T cells responding to the same epitope, which are pathogenic in this case. It should be noted that treatment with pathogen-specific Tregs is not always beneficial. In mice infected with Mtb, adoptive transfer of pathogen epitope-specific Tregs resulted in delayed effector CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to non-cognate Mtb epitopes in the draining lymph nodes and lungs and subsequent increased bacterial load [19].",

This lag resulted in a lack of suppression of initial Tconv activation. However, even by 1\u20132 divisions, Tconv downregulated CD69 and CD25 expression in the presence of M133 Tregs (\nFigure 6B\n), suggesting decreased activation compared to mice that received only M133 Tconv. Notably, even after Treg proliferation began, the M133 Tconv/Treg ratio continued to increase in the DCLN and CLN, the sites of priming, but not the spleen or ILN (\nFigure 3C\n), suggesting preferential retention or proliferation and perhaps, recruitment of Tconv. Preferential M133-specific effector CD4 T cell expansion also occurs in the natural infection because the ratio of M133-specific Tregs/T effector cells in the na\u00efve precursor pool is 0.15 but this decreases to 0.02 in the infected brain [12].",

Consistent with this, fewer M133 Tconv were detected in the spleen at this time point after co-transfer (\nFigure 5B\n). These results are similar to those obtained from FTY720-treated mice (\nFigure 4\n), which showed that when T cell egress was blocked, proliferating cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes but were not detected in distal lymphoid tissues. Tconv activation in the DCLN was also diminished in the presence of transferred M133 Tregs (\nFigure 6B\n). Tregs use a multitude of mechanisms to suppress Tconv and dendritic cell function, including the production of IL-10 [1], [29]. IL-10 was expressed by M133 Tregs within 4 divisions and likely contributed to the suppression of Tconv proliferation in the DCLN (\nFigure 7\n). Collectively, these results suggest that the relative numbers of virus-specific Tconv in the DCLN, spleen and brain of mice that received M133 Tregs, compared to those did not, reflect a complicated interplay between Treg effects on Tconv activation, proliferation and migration.",

In their absence, virus clearance was delayed and survival decreased [2], [3]. In these studies, Tregs were depleted prior to infection, a time when very few Tregs are virus-specific [12], [15]. Together, the results from these studies and the present one suggest that non virus-specific Tregs are important for initial egress from lymphoid tissue to sites of inflammation, but virus-specific Tregs, which would be induced later in the infection, function to inhibit migration of virus-specific T cells to the infected site.",

M133 Tregs, if transferred alone, suppressed the endogenous M133 and, to a lesser extent, S358-specific CD4 T cell responses (\nFigure 8E\n). Similar results were obtained when the suppressive ability of M133 Tregs was examined in vitro (\nFigure 9\n). Preferential suppression of the M133 Tconv compared to the S358 Tconv response may reflect antigen competition between endogenous M133 Tconv and transferred M133 Tregs. This suppressive effect was not generalized since the number and frequency of cells responding to CD8 T cell epitopes S510 and S598 in mice were not changed by the presence of M133 Tregs (\nFigure 8E\n) and the proliferation of S510-specific CD8 T cells in vitro was less inhibited by M133 Tregs (\nFigure 9\n). This lack of effect on CD8 T cell responses in the brain may explain why virus clearance is not changed in the presence of M133 Tregs (\nFigure 8D\n); virus clearance is largely CD8 T cell dependent [20]. The diminished numbers of M133-specific Tconv reflected decreased proliferation in the DCLN, but also likely resulted from decreased expression of CXCR3 on M133 Tconv when M133 Tregs were co-transferred (\nFigure 6E\n). Treg-mediated downregulation of CXCR3 expression on Tconv in draining lymph nodes was also observed in mice with autoimmune diabetes [30]. Further, transfer of M133 Tregs resulted in decreased expression of MHC class II on microglia, which potentially diminished their ability to activate T cells (\nFigure 8I\n). In addition, M133 Tregs entered the brain at earlier times than M133 Tconv (Figure 3D). Together, these results suggest that Tregs directly suppressed microglia activation, but it is also possible that decreased numbers of Tconv in the brain contributed to lower microglial MHC class II expression.",

We and others have shown that the expression of IFN-\u03b3 does not abrogate the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs in vitro or in mice and is even required for optimal activity in some settings [12], [27], [31], [32]. However, Treg-expressed IFN-\u03b3 may contribute to the inflammatory milieu, although whether this is physiologically significant will require further work. It is also notable that while Tregs in the brains of rJ2.2-infected mice expressed IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b3 expression by Tregs has not been detected in the lungs or draining lymph nodes of mice infected with Mtb or influenza A virus [10], [13]. Although M133 Tregs ameliorated clinical disease in rJ2.2-infected mice, their immunosuppressive efficacy in the inflamed brain may have been suboptimal. In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, myelin-specific Tregs were detected in the brain and spinal cord, but their function was inhibited by TNF and IL-6 [33]; these two cytokines are expressed in the rJ2.2-infected CNS [20], [34].",
