            "text": "Different from gallo-tannins, ellagi-tannins contain additional binding motifs that arise from additional oxidative coupling reactions between the galloyl fragments [6]. The biosynthesis of ellagi-tannin is therefore an oxidative enzymatic progression of gallo-tannins. The first step is an oxidation of 1,2,3,4,6-pentagalloylglucose to form the monomeric ellagi-tannin. The second step consists essentially of dimerization after a second enzyme-mediated specific oxidation of hexahydroxydiphenoyl group of the ellagi-tannin with the galloyl group of another tannin to form a valoneyl group-containing dimer and these reactions continue to form higher oligomers. An example of ellagi-tannin is the tannin of chestnut wood (Figure 2).",

Small proportions of flavan-3-ols, flavan-3,4-diols, and other flavonoid analogs are also present [7,8]. Carbohydrates, such as broken down residues of hemicelluloses, and hexoses, pentoses, and disaccharides together with some imino acids and amino acids [2,9] constitute the non-phenolic part of tannin extracts. These latter, as well as the monoflavonoids, are equally present in too low a proportion to influence the extract properties. On the contrary, oligomers derived from hydrolysed hemicelluloses are often present in sufficient quantities. Equally, carbohydrate chains of various lengths [4,5] are also sometime linked to the flavonoid unit in the tannin. The basic structure of these tannins is based on the flavonoid unit (Figure 3).",

            "text": "The manufacture of leather is still the largest use of tannins of vegetable origin. Leather has traditionally been made in ground pits in which alternating layers of animal skins and wood chips containing tannins, such as oak chips, have been placed and soaked for considerable periods of time. The skins were passed through a number of consecutive pits, generally 28, so as to be slowly enriched and \u201ctanned\u201d by the tannin in solution. The tannins exfiltrated the wood chips and slowly impregnated increasingly more of each skin. Such a manufacturing system was practiced for many centuries and produced good quality leather but it took several months, often a whole year, for the leather to be ready. The first change came when the tannin extraction industry, which had grown considerably in the 1850s to supply black iron tannate dyes to color silk, was in a desperate position because of the change in fashion. Some tannin extraction plants were able to demonstrate that by directly adding tannin extract to traditional tanning pits, the same quality of leather could be produced in just 28 days (28 pits, one per day). Leather tanned in this way began to prevail and this use led to a boom which lasted mainly until the end of the Second World War. In particular, the war years were good simply because armies were walking in leather boots.",

            "text": "At the end of the Second World War, three events contributed significantly to the steady decline in vegetable tanned leather. First, the introduction of synthetic materials, derived from petrol, for shoe soles begun to compete strongly with leather for one of its most traditional applications. Secondly, the demobilization of armies, which sharply reduced the need for leather shoes, and the third, the strong penetration of the market by chromium salt tanning for the manufacture of soft leathers, in particular the upper part of shoes. With all these changes, while vegetable leather has now begun to gain a reputation as a luxury product, there are still some important niches for which it is used such as equestrian equipment, heavy bags and luggage, and other heavy applications as well as the real high price luxury markets. Although the traditional 28 pits tanning method still exists for a number of special leathers as well as in the case of artisanal leather (as in Morocco for example), the tanning processes has also evolved for vegetable tanning where rotary drums, a technique borrowed from chrome tanning, allows vegetable tanning to be finalized in about 24 h. Today, research on vegetable tanned leather has been able to produce much more supple leather through the inclusion of oils and other techniques, so that some rebirth of the use of plant tannins for other application areas appears to take place.",

First of all, the relative scarcity of tannins produced in the world, compared to the tonnage of synthetic adhesives used in the panel industry, has led to a great deal of research on the extension of the tannin resource in order to have larger tonnage. As the potential material for tannin extraction shows that millions of tons of this material can be extracted each year worldwide, some companies have started to build additional extraction plants. This movement is still relatively small, but it is ongoing. The second approach, to extend the tannin with another abundant and natural material, has led to the preparation of adhesives based on in situ copolymers of tannins and lignin [37] or copolymers of tannin and protein or soy flour [38], and the use of tannin\u2013furfuryl alcohol adhesive formulations, furfuryl alcohol being also a bio-based material [39].",

This quest has taken two approaches: (1) total elimination of formaldehyde by substituting it with aldehydes, which are less or non-toxic, and non-volatile [28,40], such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, or vanillin, the latter giving a fully bio-based tannin adhesive, and even aldehydes generated by the action of sodium periodate on glucose, sucrose and even oligomeric carbohydrates, (2) the use of non-aldehyde hardeners such as trishydroxymethylnitromethane [41] and trishydroxymethylaminomethane [42] or even by combination with furfuryl alcohol, the latter functioning both as a hardener and a contributor to a tannin/furan copolymer [39,43]. (3) The use of hexamine with the formation of \u2013CH2\u2013NH\u2013CH2\u2013 bridges between the tannin molecules, where the secondary amine is capable of absorbing any emission of formaldehyde from the heating of the wood itself or any other emission of formaldehyde to produce truly zero-formaldehyde emission panels [36,44,45,46]. (4) Lastly, the hardening of the tannins by autocondensation without the addition of a hardener, autocondensation catalysed by the wood substrate itself in the case of fast-acting procyanidin tannins, such as pine bark tannins, and for slower tannins by addition of silica or silicate or other accelerators [10,29,30,31,32,33,34,35] allowing the preparation of wood particleboard of indoor quality.",

The tannin\u2019s minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) needed for reducing by 50% the cytopathogenicity induced by a number of viruses was used as an evaluation of their effectiveness. The lower MIC values yielded the best antiviral behavior. The different tannin\u2019s minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) needed to detect microscopic alteration of normal cell morphology was also determined. Less toxic is the tannin tested in the patient\u2019s cells, thus the higher is its MCC value, the more acceptable it is as an antiviral compound. The ideal antiviral compound is then the one presenting a combination of the lowest MIC and the highest MCC. The effectiveness of different tannins due to their polyphenolic nature can be very high against a number of different viruses. This is due to their irreversible reaction and combination with the viruses capsid proteins. It is the same reaction used in leather tannins and in their association with carbohydrates.",

In short, the level of tannin in any of these products must be within a definite interval/concentration range for the beverage to be organoleptically pleasing. Too low an amount of tannin and the beverage will be insipid and with no taste. Too high the proportion of tannins in the beverage and it is too unpleasant, too \u201ctanning\u201d for the consumer\u2019s mouth. Many wines, some beers, and several fruit juices however contain too low a concentration of tannin and thus may need to be \u201cdoctored\u201d. Initially, addition of tannin or tannin-rich wood chips directly to wine to enhance its taste and give the impression of a wine of greater age was strictly forbidden in most European countries. With the determined and successful push for wine markets by southern hemisphere producers where limitations on adding oak particles to the wine to accelerate its aging was not forbidden, producers of more established countries tried to defend their market in a different way. Some producers the wines of which were particularly low in tannin content started to add tannin directly to some of their wines. Although addition of additives for aging was legally forbidden the perfectly legal gap existed permitting the use of tannins to precipitate proteic matter in the wine to render it \u201cclearer\u201d. All what was needed then was to add more tannins than what would be required to render the wine \u201cclear\u201d. This was kept fairly confidential, to not incur potential problems. The situation changed dramatically once the so-called \u201cFrench paradox\u201d came to be known. Namely, notwithstanding that traditional French diet is very rich in fats that should lead to grave cardiovascular diseases this is not the case, and this type of disease was far less frequent in France. This was ascribed to the regular use of red wine which decreased to extremely low level the risks and the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. Now not only is tannin added to the wine, but it is considered particularly beneficial to do it. It must be pointed out that it is particularly purified tannin, from which carbohydrates and other components have been eliminated. It is the antioxidant property of the polyphenolic groups of the tannin which gives to it the powerful anticardiovascular effect and positive properties. Both addition of tannin as well as addition of tannin-rich oak wood chips to wine is now completely legal in Europe.",

First, foams have been developed based on the reaction of a modified tannin either by benzoylation or by oxypropylation to make it more susceptible as polyol to the reaction with polymeric isocyanates [62,63,64,65]. This first approach follows the same approach that was made with another natural polyphenol, namely lignin [66]. This is a traditional approach where tannin only functions as a polyol. The second approach of this type uses a very different strategy based on the reaction of a tannin with an aldehyde and the subsequent reaction of the methylol (\u2013CH2OH) groups so formed with the isocyanate. This approach is now used for both tannin wood adhesives [25,67] and other formaldehyde adhesives such as urea-formaldehyde (UF), melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) and phenol-formaldehyde (PF) [25,26]. Incidentally it is the only system that allows the formation of urethanes in an aqueous medium.",

Other species in the mix were involved in urethane linkages formation: (1) glyoxal after or before its reaction with the tannin, (2) the phenolsulfonic acid catalyst, and (3) furfural. Furfural instead preferred to form methylene bridges with the flavonoids A ring than to form urethane linkages by reacting with the isocyanate. Thus, methylene and urethane bridges were formed between all the main materials in the mix. Thus, a number of mixed species bound by both types of linkages were formed.

Expansion to a foam of the fluid phase is caused by a low-boiling physical blowing agent, while simultaneous cross-linking of the resinous mixture provides dimensional stabilization at the desired low density [69].

In addition to rigid foams, flexible foams have been developed [82,83,84]. Foams with the most reactive tannins of the procyanidin type, such as pine tannin, were also developed [85,86] and the carbonization line of research of these foams has also been continued and improved [87]. The varieties of these foams are really considerable [88] and the literature on this subject is really quite large, too vast to be summarized in this article.",

Among others, open-cell foams have been used for very good acoustic insulation [89], carbonized foams for a large number of different applications [87,90], and also more recently for bone repair by osteogenesis with stem cells [91]. Taking the latter case as an example, for this application, as the treatment options are limited, bone tissue engineering opens the possibility of growing an unlimited amount of tissue products with increased therapeutic potential for the management of clinical cases characterized by severe bone loss. Bone engineering relies on the use of conformal biomaterial scaffolds, osteocompetent cells, and biologically active agents. Among other things, porous tannin spray dried powder (PTSDP) has been approved for human use. Thus the powder derived by grinding tannin\u2013furanic foams has been used as a low-cost reconstruction material, due to its biocompatibility and potential ability to be replaced by bone in vivo. In this study, macro-PTSDP scaffolds with defined geometry, porosity, and mechanical properties were made by combining casting technology and pore leaching by mixing PTSDP and hydroxyapatite (Ca10 (PO4) 6 (OH)2. This has shown that the scaffolds developed in this work support the attachment, long-term viability, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. The combination of some macroporous PTSDP scaffolds with patient-specific osteocompetent cells offers therefore new opportunities to develop bone grafts with increased clinical potential for complex skeletal reconstructions.",

Among those are (1) cooling and lubricating the drilling strings while it is circulating, (2) transporting the cuttings that are created at the bottom of the hole and release them at the surface, (3) controlling the formation pressure while maintaining the wellbore stability, (4) sealing the permeable formations across the wellbore, and (5) assisting the logging operations. In drilling operations, the basic properties of drilling fluids are usually defined by the well program and monitored including rheology, density, fluid loss, solid content, and chemical properties. To avoid any drilling problems such as a blowout, stuck pipe, and other problems, engineers are always searching for a good performance of a drilling fluid system that is fit for the purpose. Dealing with standard temperature and pressure conditions, the properties of drilling fluids are much easier to handle. While in hostile drilling conditions like high temperature environments, the selection of a drilling fluid is more crucial, alongside the lithology that is one of the factors to be considered. The high temperature environment is often said to be at a temperature more than 150 \u00b0C. In geothermal drilling, the down hole temperature can reach up to 250\u2013350 \u00b0C at the depth of 1000 to 2000 m. At this temperature, the selection of a drilling fluid becomes more stringent due to the needs of thermal stability of the drilling fluid system as well as materials used in the system. High temperatures can cause chemical alterations of various drilling fluid components, thus affecting the filtration and viscosity as well as increasing the tendency for gelation. In addition to this, clay activities greatly affect the system, with high tendencies to flocculate and gel.",

Calcium lignosulfonate (CaLS) is dissolved in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid for decalcification. The amount of CaLS added to the solution depends on the weight ratio between CaLS and the desired tannin. The mixture is frequently stirred for 10 min and sodium hydroxide is then added to adjust the pH of the solution to between 3 and 4. Then, the calcium sulfate is removed from the solution by filtration to obtain lignosulfonic acid. On a hot plate at a temperature of 105 \u00b0C, formaldehyde is added to the solution to initiate crosslinking. The tannin is then added according to the desired weight, and the solution is stirred continuously for 2 h. The ferrous sulfate heptahydrate is chelated with the solution for 30 min at the same temperature. Finally, the tannin\u2013lignosulfonate solution is dried in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 60 \u00b0C for 48 h. The evaluation of the decomposition rate by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) provided proof of the thermal stability of the tannin\u2013lignosulfonate. The thermal stability of tannin\u2013lignosulfonate has been identified at 294 \u00b0C and more than 60% of the weight remains at this temperature.

The relative proportions of reaction on these two sites differed for tannin and monomer model compounds. The reactions is temperature-dependent. The reaction, which takes place at temperatures around 180 \u00b0C, leads to hard solid finishes and films particularly suitable for attachment to aluminum and stainless steel and presents high thermal stability. Their potential use for which they were initially developed is in particular for the attachment of teflon coatings on non-stick steel or aluminum frying pans [109,110]. Subsequent testing with either of these tannin-based adhesives or other natural polyphenols [111] has demonstrated resistance to temperatures in excess of 400 \u00b0C for certain periods of time. Ammonia and high temperatures favor these reactions. The first application tests performed at high temperatures showed good performance as a metal coating.

The wattle tannin\u2013urea\u2013formaldehyde copolymer formed in situ, and any free formaldehyde left in the glue line was absorbed by the wattle tannin extract. The wattle extract powder should be added at level of 4 to 5% of the total starch content of the mix (i.e., carrier plus slurry). Successful results can be achieved in the range of 2 to 12% of the total starch content, but 4% is the recommended starting level. The final level is determined by the degree of water hardness and desired bond quality. This wattle extract\u2013UF fortifier system is highly flexible and can be adopted to damp-proof a multitude of basic starch formulations. This system has been in operation for some decades in countries where tannin is easily obtainable.",

This tannic ink or solubilized tannins is sometimes referred to as ferric ink, ferro-gallic, or metallogallic. Irreversible damage to paper due to this corrosive ink poses significant conservation problems. The particularity of this ink lies in its absence of pigment or dye; it is the action of metal salts (iron or copper sulfate) which, added to the tannic material (the gall nut), gives the black hue, most often dark violet before aging. Its defect is its corrosivity, for the paper as well as for the metal quill. To limit this inconvenience, its manufacture must be the subject of a good aging; maceration of the tannin for three months then, after mixing with the iron salt, a maturation of at least two months to one year guaranteeing its optimum. There is a plethora of different recipes. The three main constituents are:",

This mixture is swelled in lukewarm water for one day. Salicylic acid or phenol may be added to prevent the development of microorganisms. It is hygroscopic (slows down drying) and keeps the ink particles in suspension and prevents them from precipitating (colloidal solution). In the fifteenth century, plum, apricot, or cherry resins were used to achieve this. The excess of ink so prepared can be dried. Full drying was done in pork bladders. The base ink (tannin) is then redissolved and a reagent is prepared, with iron sulfate dissolved in warm water, to which gum arabic is added. The tannin solution is boiled separately and gum arabic is also added. The mixture is allowed to cool and the two solutions are mixed. The ink so prepared is then ready for writing. This type of ink was still used in primary schools in some countries in Europe for some time after the Second World War.",
