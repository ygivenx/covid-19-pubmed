They infect various animals and human, causing various respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, neurological, mucocutaneous and systemic diseases [1, 2]. Based on genotypic and serological characterization, the family Picornaviridae is currently divided into 29 genera with at least 50 species. Among the various picornaviruses belonging to nine genera that are able to infect humans, poliovirus and human enterovirus A71 are best known for their neurotropism and ability to cause mass epidemics with high morbidities and mortalities [3, 4]. Picornaviruses are also known for their potential for mutations and recombination, which may allow the generation of new variants to emerge [5\u201310].",

As a result, there has been growing interest to understand the diversity and evolution of animal and zoonotic viruses. For picornaviruses, numerous novel human and animal picornaviruses have been discovered in the past decade [1, 16\u201327]. We have also discovered a novel picornavirus, canine picodicistrovirus (CPDV), with two internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which represents a unique feature among Picornaviridae [28]. Moreover, novel picronaviruses were identified in previously unknown animal hosts such as cats, bats and camels [29\u201331], reflecting our slim knowledge on the diversity and host range of picornaviruses. The discovery and characterization of novel picornaviruses is important for better understanding of their evolution, pathogenicity and emergence potential.",

Moreover, little is known about the pathogenicity of the recently discovered rodent pricornaviruses, such as rodent stool-associated picornavirus (rosavirus) A1, mouse stool-associated picornavirus (mosavirus) A1, Norway rat hunnivirus and rat-borne virus (rabovirus A) [32, 33]. In this report, we explored the diversity of picornaviruses among rodents in China and discovered two potentially novel picornaviruses, \u201cRosavirus B\u201d and \u201cRosavirus C\u201d. While rosavirus B was detected in the street rat, Norway rats, rosavirus C was detected in five different wild rat species, suggesting potential interspecies transmission. Their complete genome sequences were determined, which showed that \u201cRosavirus B\u201d and \u201cRosavirus C\u201d represent two novel picornavirus species distinct from Rosavirus A. Rosavirus C isolated from cell culture causes multisystemic diseases in a mouse model, with histopathological changes and positive viral antigen expression in lungs and liver of infected mice.",

Initial screening by RT-PCR for a 159-bp fragment of 3Dpol gene of picornaviruses was positive in 18 respiratory and 24 alimentary samples from 37 rodents of six different species. The sequences from these positive samples had <84% aa identities to the corresponding segments of 3Dpol genes of known picornaviruses, suggesting the presence of potential novel picornaviruses. Subsequent RT-PCR using specific primers targeting these potential novel picornaviruses on the 2450 samples was positive in 62 respiratory and 70 alimentary samples from 92 rodents. The sequences from these 132 samples had <86% aa identities to the corresponding segments of 3Dpol genes of known picornaviruses, being most closely related to Rosavirus A. Moreover, these sequences fell into two distinct clusters, one formed by sequences from wild rodents of five different species from Hong Kong (chestnut spiny rat, greater bandicoot rat, Indochinese forest rats and roof rat) and Hunan and Guangxi (Coxing's white-bellied rat), and the other formed by sequences from street rodents from Hong Kong (Norway rat) (Table 1 and Fig 1).

These 13 strains were selected because they were detected from different rodent species or geographical locations (Hong Kong, Hunan and Guangxi) to allow comparison between host species- or geographically distinct strains. The G + C contents of the three rosavirus B and 10 rosavirus C genomes range from 50 to 53%, with genome size 8639 to 9094 bases, after excluding the polyadenylated tract (Table 2). However, the genome sizes of some strains may be larger, as further sequencing of the ends may have been hampered by secondary structures. They share similar genome organization typical of picornaviruses, with UTR at both 5' (470\u2013752 bases) and 3' (693\u2013948 bases) ends, and a large open reading frame of 7449\u20137476 bases, which encodes potential polyprotein precursors of 2482\u20132491 aa known to be cleaved by virus-encoded proteases.

In all three trees, the sequences from the present rodent picornaviruses formed two distinct clusters among known picornaviruses, being most closely related to Rosavirus A of the genus Rosavirus. However, their genomes shared only 56.3\u201359.8% nt identities with that of Rosavirus A.

The conserved sequence Yn-Xm-AUG is present in the 5'UTR of rosavirus B and C. While Y7-X19-AUG is found in rosavirus A, the number of Y (6 or 7) and X (19\u201321) varies among rosavirus B and C. The putative translation initiation sites were contained by an optimal Kozak context (RNNAUGG), with in frame AUG at position 471 to 753. The 5'UTR of many picornaviruses possesses an internal ribosomal entry site/segment (IRES) which is responsible for directing the initiation of translation in a cap-independent manner, and requires both canonical translation initiation and IRES trans-acting factors [3, 34]. Similar to rosavirus A [32], rosavirus B and C also contained a type II-like IRES with stem loops, major domains [19, 27, 35\u201340] and conserved motifs (Fig 3). However, domain E was only present in rosavirus C strains, RASK8F, RATLC11A, NFSM6F and RASM14A, and rosavirus B strain RNYL1109081R, but not other strains. The pyrimidine-rich region was located near 3' end of 5'UTR. One to three stem-loop structures were present upstream of the start codon and/or between the pyrimidine-rich region and start codon of the polyprotein [41, 42].",

To mimick the fecal-oral route of transmission typical of many picornavirus infections, oral inoculation of rosavirus C RASM14A was performed on 21 four-day-old suckling mice. One of the suckling mice was eaten by its mother on day one post-challenge. All the remaining 20 suckling mice survived after viral challenge till sacrifice, but some mice exhibit transient roughening of hair two to three days after challenge. Among the nine mice sacrificed on day 3 post-challenge, rosavirus C RASM14A was detected in the intestine and lung of all nine mice, kidney of one mouse, and spleen and liver of three and four mice respectively by RT-PCR. Among the five mice sacrificed on day 7 post-challenge, rosavirus C RASM14A was detected in the intestine of all five mice, liver and lung of four mice, and spleen and kidney of two and one mice respectively by RT-PCR. Among the three mice sacrificed on day 14 post-challenge, rosavirus C RASM14A was detected in the lung of one mouse by RT-PCR. Among the three mice sacrificed on day 21 post-challenge, rosavirus C RASM14A was detected in the lung of one mouse by RT-PCR.

Though being phylogenetically most closely related to Rosavirus A, \u201cRosavirus B\u201d and \u201cRosavirus C\u201d should represent two novel species distinct from Rosavirus A under the genus Rosavirus, according to the criteria for International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses species demarcation for different members of Picornaviridae [52]. Rosavirus B and C also exhibited different genome features when compared to rosavirus A. Notably, the absence of myristylation site in VP4 of rosavirus C and its varying presence in rosavirus B is intriguing. The VP4 myristylation site has been shown to play a role in localization of the capsid protein for cellular entry and permeability [43, 53]. Its absence in some rosavirus strains suggests that rosaviruses may utilize alternative strategies for capsid localization on cellular targets. In addition, the variations in Yn-Xm-AUG sequence in 5\u2019UTR may also suggest different translational dynamics among rosaviruses. Besides phylogenetic and genomic evidence, the two viruses infect different host, with \u201cRosavirus B\u201d infecting Norway rats (a street rat) and \u201cRosavirus C\u201d infecting various wild rats, as supported by positive specific and/or neutralizing antibodies in the respective animals. Further studies are required to better understand the epidemiology of these novel rosaviruses in other rodent population.",

Picornaviruses belonging to Cardiovirus, Hunnivirus, Kobuvirus, Mosavirus, Parechovirus and Rosavirus are known to infect different rodents [32, 33, 54]. Rosavirus A was first discovered in a wild canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinintus) in California [32]. Subsequently, a variant, rosavirus 2, was detected in the fecal specimens of children in the Gambia [26], which prompted further studies to investigate potential transmission of rosavirus from rodents to humans. In this study, the observed low Ka/Ks ratios in various coding regions supported that Norway rats (street rats) in Hong Kong, and wild rats across Hong Kong and mainland China, are natural reservoirs of rosavirus B and C respectively. In particular, Coxing\u2019s white-bellied rats appeared to be an important host for rosavirus C. The relatively low seroprevalence of rosavirus C, as compared to RT-PCR detection rate, among tested Coxing\u2019s white-bellied rats (7.5%) may be due to delayed antibody response during acute infection when the animals were still shedding viruses. Together with the ability of rosavirus C in infecting house mouse (Mus musculus), our findings provided evidence for the interspecies transmission potential of rosavirus C among different rodent species. This is in line with the ability of bat picornaviruses group 1 to 3 in infecting bats of different genera or species [29]. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), of which swine is the major reservoir, can also infect different animals including rodents, elephants, boars, macaques and humans [55]. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the ability of rosaviruses to cross species barrier and emerge in other animals or human.",

Although rosavirus A has been detected in rodents and human previously [26, 32], no virus isolate was available for pathogenicity studies. A few picornaviruses, such as EMCV (cardiovirus A) and Theilovirus (cardiovirus B) under Cardiovirus and Ljungan virus (LV) (parechovirus B) under Parechovirus, were also known to cause systemic infections in infected rodents. In particular, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), which primarily causes asymptomatic enteric infections in mice, has been intensively studied because of its ability to cause myocarditis, type 1 diabetes and acute or persistent demyelinating infections mimicking multiple sclerosis [35, 56]. On the other hand, rodents experimentally infected with EMCV may develop type 1 diabetes mellitus, encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, orchitis and sialodacryoadenitis [57]. Interestingly, LV, which may cause type 1 diabetes and fetal deaths in infected rodents, has been recently found in human intrauterine fetal death and sudden infant death syndrome [58\u201361]. However, the pathogenicity of other rodent picornaviruses, such as rosavirus A1, mosavirus A1, murine kobuvirus 1, Norway rat hunnivirus and rabovirus A, was less clear [32, 33]. The ability of rosavirus C in causing multisystemic infection in mice with high viral loads in infected organs suggested that rosaviruses may cause severe infections in their host. Further experimental studies using other rosaviruses and rodent species may help to better understand the pathogenicity of members of the genus Rosavirus in different rodents and human.",

Incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (Sigma) was used in subsequent immunizations. Three inoculations at once every two weeks per guinea pig were administered. Two weeks after the last immunization, 1 ml of blood was taken via the lateral saphenous vein of the guinea pigs to obtain the sera.",

Tissues for histological examination were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histopathological changes were observed using Nikon 80i microscope and imaging system. Infected cell lines and tissues from challenged mice that were tested positive for rosavirus C RASM14A by RT-PCR were subject to viral load studies and immunohistochemical staining for viral VP1 protein as described previously [28, 69]. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by blocking endogenous peroxidase with 0.3% H2O2 for 25 min, and then with 1% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 25 min to minimize non-specific staining. The tissue sections were then pre-treated with streptavidin solution and biotin solution at room temperature for 30 min respectively to avoid high background signals due to the endogenous biotin or biotin-binding proteins in the tissues. The sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with 1:2000 dilution of guinea pig anti-VP1 anti-serum, followed by incubation of 30 min at room temperature with 1:2000 dilution of biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG, H & L chain (Abcam). Streptavidin/peroxidase complex reagent (Vector Laboratories) was then added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Cells infected or uninfected by rosavirus C RASM14A were included as positive and negative controls respectively in each staining. Cells were fixed in chilled acetone at -20\u00b0C for 10 min before incubation with antibodies for staining. Color development was performed using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine and images captured with Nikon 80i imaging system and Spot-advance computer software.",
