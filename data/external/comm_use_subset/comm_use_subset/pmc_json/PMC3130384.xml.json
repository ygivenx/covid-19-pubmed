            "text": "This review is concerned with three kinds of predictions. The first kind is to do with the risk that an exotic or novel infection will appear in a given host population. This risk has been formally estimated for, for example, rabies or foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) being introduced into the UK [1,2]. The second kind is that, given an infectious disease is present, how fast will it spread, how many people or animals will be affected and how long will it persist for? This has been attempted for a wide variety of infectious diseases including Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [3], bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) [4] and FMD [5]. The third kind of prediction is to do with what might happen if an intervention is attempted: if people or animals are to be treated, vaccinated or quarantined in an attempt to contain an epidemic then how many, how selected and how quickly? There is a substantial literature addressing this type of question, e.g. FMD [6] or human influenza [7].",

The focus here is mainly on infectious diseases of humans and animals, although many of the issues are equally relevant to plant diseases, as has been discussed elsewhere [8,9].",

For some questions, this may be adequate; an example is given below (\u00a73a). For other questions, these informal approaches can be highly unreliable, the reason being that infectious diseases have nonlinear dynamics. One way to express this is that the biggest risk factor for acquiring an infection is the presence of infectious individuals, which introduces positive feedback into epidemic processes, in turn making the expected trajectory of an epidemic or the likely impact of control measures considerably more difficult to predict than is the case for non-communicable diseases such as stroke, cancer or obesity. On occasion, these nonlinearities can make infectious disease dynamics counterintuitive: some examples are shown in figure 1.\n",

This concerned optimal levels of pre-emptive culling of livestock on farms in the neighbourhood of a FMD case, where \u2018optimal\u2019 implies minimizing the total number of farms lost over the course of an epidemic. The analysis identified a conflict between local and global optima. Using parameter values consistent with the UK 2001 FMD epidemic, the globally optimal culling rate is almost four times as high as the local optimum; this reflects the need to reduce the likelihood of disease spreading from one local cluster to others. From a local perspective, this level of culling might well be regarded as \u2018overkill\u2019, \u2018draconian\u2019 or \u2018disproportionate\u2019 (all terms that were used during 2001), but the local perspective is not the most relevant one for decision makers. Another result was to illustrate that under-control is more dangerous than over-control, ultimately leading to more farms lost (the gradient of the curves are much steeper to the left of the optima than to the right). This result is quite general: if control measures are inadequate then an epidemic will not be brought under control and more of the population will be affected in the long run. If, as will often be the case in practice, there is uncertainty about the optimal level of control effort then it will often be preferable to err towards too much rather than too little.",

            "text": "The third example (figure 1c) concerns the relationship between causes and effects. Intuitively, it might be expected that statistical analysis would indicate a negative relationship between disease incidence and control effort (at least, if control was effective). Although this would normally be the case when control is implemented proactively and uniformly, it is not necessarily the case when control is implemented reactively and locally. In those circumstances disease must be present before a control effort is initiated, disease and control will then co-occur until disease has been locally eliminated, at which point control will cease. This sequence of events is depicted in figure 1c and is as likely to produce a positive correlation or no correlation as a negative one. This is a well-known paradox that applies in other contexts too [11], but misinterpretations persist, e.g. of the effectiveness of control by pre-emptive culling during the UK FMD 2001 epidemic [12,13]. This issue is a good illustration of the dangers of static analyses of dynamic systems, and is a strong argument for the use of dynamic models in infectious disease epidemiology.",

The main hazards identified are listed in table 1. The two most consistent concerns of the experts involved were the emergence of novel pathogens and of drug-resistant variants of existing pathogens. There was much less agreement on the importance of different drivers of changes in infectious disease risks, presumably in part reflecting much more variability in these across different disease systems but also reflecting genuine uncertainty as to what the main drivers will be. Climate change, for example, was much more of a concern for infectious diseases in Africa than in the UK, and for 2030 rather than 2015. Similarly, economic and social factors were seen as much more important drivers for human infectious disease risk in Africa than in the UK. The study had many limitations [16], not least the simplistic assumption that drivers will act independently on disease risks, but nonetheless it provides a useful starting point for more evidence-based approaches (see \u00a75).\n",

As discussed in \u00a72, the risks of individuals becoming infected are dynamic and not independent of one another; this introduces spatial and temporal autocorrelations that may be difficult to account for [19]. This problem is exacerbated when the intention is to predict future risks, perhaps under different scenarios such as a range of possible intervention strategies. Extrapolations of statistical models have limited value in this context. Hence, as discussed below, dynamic models have often been preferred.",

The scientific literature contains many thousands of studies of the former but far less attention has been paid to the latter (see [20] for an example). Sometimes susceptibility and transmission may be closely related, e.g. for vector-borne diseases, but for others they may be quite distinct, e.g. for faecal\u2013oral transmitted infections. There are some obvious reasons for this lack of attention. First, it is often much harder to establish that an individual has transmitted infection than that it has acquired infection, whether this information is to be inferred from contact tracing studies (as carried out during the 2001 UK FMD epidemic [21]) or from the analysis of pathogen typing or sequence data (as carried out during the 2007 UK FMD outbreak [22]). Second, the sample size available is not the total population but the infected population (each of whom may or may not have transmitted infection onwards), typically a much smaller number with a corresponding loss of statistical power to identify risk factors.",

A risk profile or risk map is thus generated which can be used for direct surveillance, prevention or control efforts. An example of this occurred in Scotland in September 2007, when there was a FMD outbreak in Surrey in England [23]. A risk map was generated based on livestock movement records and local risk factors, and this was used to direct surveillance efforts, allowing Scotland to provide evidence of freedom from disease much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible, and so accelerating the lifting of movement restrictions imposed in response to the risk of FMD (figure 2).\n",

Much recent modelling work on both human and animal diseases has used stochastic, individual-based models (IBMs; see [26] for an overview). This approach has a number of advantages:\n\u2014 individuals are represented explicitly and their infection status or any other attribute can be tracked;\u2014 heterogeneities between individuals (attributes such as age or spatial location, or risk factors for infection) can be represented directly and non-parametrically (i.e. no assumptions need to be made about statistical patterns of variation across the population); and\u2014 complex individual histories, e.g. with respect to interventions, can be incorporated in a fully realistic manner.There are also well-recognized disadvantages:\n\u2014 when tailored to specific events, the models may lack generality;\u2014 IBMs are often very complex and cannot be studied analytically, making it hard to understand the relationship between inputs and outputs;\u2014 the models can be hard to parametrize and efforts to formally fit IBMs to complex epidemic data, e.g. for FMD in the UK in 2001, have met with only qualified success [27,28]; and\u2014 the models may require a large amount of very detailed input data, e.g. individuals' travel patterns, which may be difficult to acquire [7].The above issues underline the importance of model verification and model validation. Verification is demonstration that the model accurately represents the developer's conceptual description and specifications, i.e. that it does what it is supposed to do. Validation means simply that the model achieves pre-set performance requirements, i.e. that it is fit for purpose. Verification and validation are essential features of good practice in the development and the use of mathematical models [29,30] especially, of course, when the models are intended to be policy-relevant.",

Another study [32] compared statistical risk factor analysis and stochastic simulation models fitted using maximum-likelihood methods, as applied to Escherichia coli O157 on cattle farms.

Under-reporting is a major problem for diseases such as human influenza or sheep scrapie, where the great majority of cases may be unrecognized and unreported. This was also the case during the early stages of the BSE epidemic [4]. This may mean that actual infection rates are orders of magnitude higher than indicated by reported case numbers (e.g. pandemic H1N1 in England in 2009 [34]). Reporting delays can also obscure epidemic dynamics in real time. Without a detailed understanding of reporting patterns, case data (and, no less, indirect measures such as Internet search behaviour [35]) become unreliable inputs into quantitative analysis and need to be supplemented or replaced, e.g. by active case finding or serosurveillance (looking for evidence of exposure to infection based on detection of specific antibody responses).",

For humans, although information on specific kinds of movements such as commuting distances or international air travel is often available, these sources provide at best an incomplete and potentially a biased picture of relevant human movement patterns.

Climate change is an important and topical subject, but that is not its only attraction for studies to predict changes in disease risk. Climate data are quantitative, measured at fine spatial scales and, crucially, sophisticated projections are available describing how climate variables are expected to change over coming decades. A few other drivers, such as human demography (population density, age structure, urbanization, etc.) have similar attributes. Many others (such as investment in public health, population displacement, natural disasters, war, etc.) may well be just as important but their role is hard to quantify and their future behaviour even harder to predict [16]. In short, identifying drivers of disease risk and predicting their future impact are very much the art of the possible. As an example, two events that could have major impacts on the future of livestock disease in European countries are reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)\u2014which would greatly influence farming practices\u2014and the accession of countries such as Turkey that regularly experience exotic infections such as FMD. These events are extremely hard to \u2018predict\u2019, in contrast to the way that climate change is predicted, but may well turn out to have considerably greater epidemiological consequences over the next few decades.",

Some kinds of intervention are relatively easy to quantify and evaluate: examples include the impact of vaccination programmes and the role of herd immunity [49], or the impact of culling for the control of animal diseases [50]. For other interventions\u2014such as biosecurity measures against FMD, or the use of face masks against influenza\u2014their use is not reliably reported nor their efficacy known. Another difficulty is knowing the way in which control measures are applied in practice. For example, the pre-emptive culling during the UK 2001 FMD epidemic was found retrospectively to have been significantly biased towards lower risk farms (mostly smaller sheep farms) rather than higher risk farms (mostly larger farms with cattle). The actual impact of the culling programme is, therefore, likely to have been less than anticipated when the policy was first proposed [51].",

Pathogens are emerging and re-emerging at alarming rates [52]. Numerous studies of specific pathogens have linked their emergence/re-emergence to particular drivers (table 2), although most such studies are purely descriptive and the association with drivers is based on no more than a subjective interpretation of events. Better evidence is needed to make strong assertions about cause and effect:\n\u2014 individual drivers need to be identified more precisely than high-level descriptors such as \u2018climate change\u2019;\u2014 drivers need to be measured and mapped, and changes in drivers need to be monitored;\u2014 interactions between multiple drivers need to be identified;\u2014 statistical associations between emergence events and drivers or combinations of drivers need to be tested; and\u2014 ideally, functional relationships between emergence events and drivers need to be demonstrated.\nAt present, however, there are very few examples of systematic studies of the relationship between emergence and drivers of emergence. Jones et al. [54] carried out a literature survey of emerging disease events (defined as the first reported appearance of a previously unknown pathogen species or strain, including drug-resistant strains) since the 1940s and attempted to relate these to a set of possible drivers using multi-variate logistic regression. They found associations between emergence events and drivers such as human population density and growth rate, latitude, rainfall and biodiversity. The main challenge was fully accounting for highly suspect reporting patterns, with fully one-third of all reported events occurring in the USA and very few in countries such as China, India, the Philippines or Mexico [55]. An interesting conclusion from this study was to suggest the existence of emerging disease \u2018hotspots\u2019, an important concept that will no doubt be refined by further analysis in the future.",

King 2005, personal communication). This idea reflects the view that many drivers of emergence (table 2) are changing in ways that, at least intuitively, should promote the emergence of novel pathogens. Even so, there are no hard data to compare on trends in emergence rates prior to the past few decades. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to conclude that the emergence of novel pathogens happens over time scales of years and decades (i.e. these are not rare events) and it is happening as fast as ever, if not faster, in the early twenty-first century.",

The origin of each of these pathogens is a unique and complex story and does not immediately suggest obvious generalizations. Nonetheless, although the emergence of a specific pathogen may always be essentially unpredictable, patterns are discernable [54]. The challenge is to move beyond statements that may well be correct but have little practical value, such as \u2018new pathogens will emerge\u2019, towards more informative (quantitative) predictions of how often this might happen, where it is likely to happen, and whether it is likely to represent a serious threat to human or animal health. This kind of information would be of considerable practical value, for example, in helping determine what kinds of disease surveillance systems are needed and where they should be deployed [52].

In this context, the inherent uncertainties in making predictions about a complex and incompletely understood system are well recognized and widely discussed. There are a substantial number of climate change models, and these agree in some respects and disagree in others [57]. It is not expected that the models will be correct in every detail; what is expected is that model predictions can be considered a reasonable basis for action by stakeholders. The same applies, over much shorter time-scales, to weather forecasting: we do not expect the weather forecast to be precisely correct on every occasion we look at it, but we do expect it to be sufficiently accurate often enough to be useful. \u2018A reasonable basis for action\u2019 seems a sensible aspiration for predictions about future disease risks.",

The kinds of issues that are addressed include: clarity of objectives, transparency, good documentation and record keeping, verification, validation, the role of peer review and audit, reproducibility, and clear and accurate communication of outputs, assumptions and uncertainties.

Often, this is a severe limitation. In some cases, this reflects a genuine lack of data but in others it reflects an unwillingness to share data. The latter is a serious issue at the international level, with some countries sometimes unwilling to report disease data to the World Health Organisation (WHO) or the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Implementation of the 2005 International Health Regulations should improve the situation, at least for human diseases, but the underlying issue is for the international community to provide incentives for reporting that compensate for the often severe disincentives associated with disease outbreaks, such as restrictions on travel and trade [52]. Even at the national level, government departments, public and animal health agencies, or academic institutes may be unwilling to release data on disease, host or drivers, thereby relinquishing \u2018ownership\u2019 of those data. Since the timely flow of usable information is an essential part of managing disease risks, not least when a human or animal health emergency arises, this problem needs to be addressed, noting that it is a cultural issue rather than a technical one.
