Due to their adaptation to desert or semi-desert regions, Old World camels tolerate harsh conditions, which are inhospitable for many livestock species, including extreme temperatures and prolonged periods without access to food and water (reviewed in Jirimutu et al., 2012). As a result, they are of socioeconomic importance across the Middle East, Northern Africa, and much of Asia, where they are used for meat, milk, hides, transportation, and sport. The significance of camels as a sustainable livestock species is likely to continue, as many regions face increased temperatures and desertification as a result of climate change (Megersa et al., 2014; Watson et al., 2016). Concurrently, recent trends towards intensive production and the movement of camel production to peri-urban settings are altering the pathogen pressures to which these animals are exposed (Abdallah and Faye, 2013).",

            "text": "Camels are also of importance with respect to a number of specific infectious diseases. For example, dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) are a natural host of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and transmission of the virus from camels to humans has been confirmed (Gossner et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2017). Interestingly, significant differences exist between dromedaries and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) with regard to their susceptibility to foot and mouth disease (FMD), one of the most costly diseases of production animals worldwide; i.e., dromedaries are not susceptible to FMD and do not transmit infection (Wernery and Kinne, 2012). Furthermore, the immune system of camels has several unusual features. Notable among these is the presence of homodimeric heavy chain antibodies (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993), not known to occur in any other mammalian family, which have both potential and realized applications in a variety of research, diagnostic, and therapeutic settings (Muyldermans et al., 2009; De Meyer et al., 2014; Steeland et al., 2016). The persistence of uniquely organized ileal Peyer\u2019s patches into adulthood of the dromedary (Zidan and Pabst, 2008) is another example. Additionally, productively rearranged dromedary T-cell receptor delta variable (TRDV) (Antonacci et al., 2011) and T-cell receptor gamma variable (TRGV) (Vaccarelli et al., 2012) genes undergo somatic hypermutation to generate a diversified repertoire of these genes. This mechanism has not been documented for T-cell receptor genes in other mammalian species and appears to compensate the more limited repertoire of TRDV and TRGV genes found in camels relative to other Artiodactyls (Ciccarese et al., 2014). A further atypical aspect of the camelid immunogenome is the unusually low genetic diversity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the three species of Old World camels in both class I (Plasil et al., 2019) and class II genes (Plasil et al., 2016). The immunological characterization of cellular components of the camel immune system is scarce mainly due to the small number of cross-reacting monoclonal antibodies raised against leukocyte antigens of humans (Hussen et al., 2017), bovines, and/or other related species (Mossad et al., 2006) available. This is also one of the reasons why natural killer cells and their functions in camelids have not been studied so far.",

            "text": "Natural killer (NK) cells constitute a heterogeneous lymphocyte population (Allan et al., 2015) involved primarily in innate immune responses against intracellular pathogens and tumor cells. They also influence adaptive immune responses via the production of cytokines (Vivier et al., 2011) and crosstalk with dendritic cells (Hamerman et al., 2005), play a role in placentation (Parham and Moffett, 2013), and contribute to the recognition of allogeneic cells. The diversity of the NK cell receptor repertoire is essential to the performance of these multiple functions. The integration of activating and inhibitory signals originating from various surface receptors determines the activation status of an individual NK cell, providing the capacity to discriminate between self and non-self or altered self (Lanier, 1998).",

            "text": "Characterization of genes underlying receptors on the NK cell surface can significantly contribute to our understanding of the functional heterogeneity of NK cells. Among them, NK cell receptors (NKR) of several gene families bind polymorphic MHC class I or MHC class I-like molecules to mediate NK cell function. Due to functional relationships between MHC and NKR molecules, the underlying genes and genomic regions represent an important biological model in terms of their co-evolution in the context of pathogen pressures, disease, and survival (Guethlein et al., 2015; Carrillo-Bustamante et al., 2016). However, the current knowledge of mammalian NKR genes, in comparison with that of MHC regions, is rather fragmentary. Two major genomic complexes encoding NKR, the natural killer complex (NKC) and the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC), have been identified in mammalian genomes. Genes in the NKC represent receptors with C-type lectin-like extracellular domains; genes in the LRC code receptors with extracellular ligand-binding domains belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (Trowsdale et al., 2001). Despite these structural differences, some receptor families of both complexes are able to fulfil the same functions in terms of MHC class I recognition, downstream signaling, and mediation of NK cell activation/inhibition. To accomplish these ends, different NKR gene families expanded and diversified in different mammalian species, representing an example of convergent evolution in mammals (Kelley et al., 2005; Guethlein et al., 2015). Two immunologically well-defined species, humans and mice, have expanded structurally unrelated receptor families: humans use the killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILR), both encoded within the LRC, whereas in mice the killer-cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) genes of one family (Klra, formerly Ly49) are expanded in the NKC. A common sign of these expanded gene families, along with allelic variation of members, is haplotypic variation in the number of genes and pseudogenes in populations/strains of same species (Marsch et al., 2003; Schenkel et al., 2013). The gene content of the LRC (human vs. primates) and NKC (mouse vs. rat) is known to vary even between closely related mammalian species and families; as a result, knowledge of NKR genes in a number of important species remains fragmentary or missing. Significant differences have been shown to exist within Artiodactyls, as for example between cattle and pigs (Sanderson et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2017; Schwartz and Hammond, 2018), but knowledge of the genes underlying camel NKR is lacking.",

The gene content and organization of the alpaca NKC region was found to be very similar to that of the camel NKC, with similarities of amino acid sequences ranging from 88% to 98%. Based on publicly available alpaca genomes, the extent of polymorphism of genomic as well as of protein sequences was higher than in either of the camel species. Five protein variants were predicted for KLRA, KLRC1, KLRC2, and KLRE. The amino acid changes were concentrated in the CTLD and the stem of KLRA and in the CTLD in KLRC2. In contrast, they were evenly distributed throughout KLRC1. KLRE coded for four functional protein variants with only three different CTLDs, and amino acid changes were concentrated mostly in the cytoplasmic tail. One allele had a 1-bp insertion leading to frameshift and a premature stop codon in the CTLD part of the receptor. The same ITIM motif as in camels was recognized in all five variants. The three variants of KLRD identified differed by one amino acid each in the stem region of the receptor and thus shared the same CTLD. KLRI also coded for three variants with the same CTLD, differing only in the cytoplasmic tail. Due to a non-synonymous substitution, a second ITIM was recreated in one of the variants. The five protein variants predicted for KLRJ differed in their CTLDs, although all of them contained the same premature stop codon according to the mRNA model. KLRK haplotypes coded for a potentially functional activating receptor (arginine in the transmembrane region).

Several different types of genomic organization of the NKR regions have been recognized in mammals (Martin et al., 2002; Hao et al., 2006; Guethlein et al., 2015), and sometimes striking differences have been observed between related taxa (Kelley et al., 2005; Sanderson et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2017; Schwartz and Hammond, 2018). Therefore, studies of genes encoding NK cell receptors may contribute to our understanding of the heterogeneity of NK cell functions in particular mammalian species. At the same time, these genes and especially complex genomic regions such as NKC and LRC represent a relevant model for evolutionary biology. Characterization of NKR genes in so far poorly studied species and/or families can bring new information on evolutionary mechanisms governing this part of the mammalian immunogenome. Despite the importance of camels as a model for immunogenetic studies (Ciccarese et al., 2014), virtually nothing is known about NK cells in camels in terms of their morphology, functions, their surface receptors, and/or underlying genes. In this context, this study represents the first report on the NKC and LRC genomic regions and on NCR genes in Old World camels and their comparison with a New World camelid, the alpaca.",

Even for these species, however, the current status of whole genome assemblies proved to be insufficient for a correct annotation of NKR genes, especially of the LRC, containing multiple copies of sometimes highly similar sequences and exhibiting copy number variations.

Therefore, it seems that PCR failures observed in some cases probably do not indicate polymorphisms in the primer binding site. Taking also into consideration the generally low polymorphism of the camel genomes (Fitak et al., 2016), the occurrence of a putative polymorphic variant on both chromosomes is not too likely. Moreover, the PCR failures concerned mostly the loci KLRC2 and KIR3DL in the Bactrians, which seem to be both pseudogenes, so we have not explored them further for the purposes of this study. Nevertheless, both loci merit to be further investigated in the future. Information that the monomorphic status of the Bactrian KLRC2 could be explained by allelic drop-out or existence of copy number variation, i.e., partial/total deletion of KLRC2 from some Bactrian NKC haplotypes, and that polymorphic amino acid positions within the KIR3DL sequences were concentrated in the second immunoglobulin-like domain, known to interact with MHC class I ligands in mammals and in the stalk region of the molecule, need to be explored.",

None of them apparently expanded into a large family; the maximum number of members within a family was two. Similar to other mammalian species, the KLRA gene codes for a homodimeric type II inhibitory receptor (Ly49) (Dimasi and Biassoni, 2005), KLRC1 encodes an inhibitory receptor with two ITIMs motifs (NKG2A) (Vance et al., 1998), KLRC2 encodes an activating receptor (NKG2C) (Lanier et al., 1998), and KLRG1 codes an inhibitory receptor for cadherin molecules (Ito et al., 2006). These data suggest that the function of these molecules could be very similar to human and other mammalian NK receptors, especially in terms of their capacity to form heterodimers CD94/NKG2A (KLRD/KLRC1), CD94/NKG2C (KLRD/KLRC2) (Braud et al., 1998), and/or KLRE/KLRI (Saether et al., 2008). In humans, the heterodimers CD94/NKG2A (KLRD/KLRC1) and CD94/NKG2C (KLRD/KLRC2) recognize a relatively low polymorphic non-classical MHC class I ligand HLA-E, and their polymorphism is also rather low (Braud et al., 1998). Contrary to rats, in which KLRH recognize MHC class I ligand (Daws et al., 2012), camelid KLRH sequences represent only remnants of a full gene sequence. Although mRNA for bovine KLRJ was described (Storset et al., 2003), the precise splicing of camelid KLRJ and possible expression as a functional receptor remains to be verified. The low polymorphism of camelid KLRK is comparable to the limited polymorphism of this gene in humans and mice encoding an activating receptor NKG2D for diverse ligands (reviewed in Lanier, 2015).",

The functionally important polymorphism of NKC genes is limited, with one monomorphic gene and six genes with two to three allelic protein variants in C. dromedarius. An even higher number of monomorphic KLR genes (three functional and two potential pseudogenes) was observed in C. bactrianus, and its KLRC2 seems to be a pseudogene. It is not clear how this low NKC variation can be related to the fact that no \u201cHLA-E-like\u201d molecule has been found to date outside of simians and rodents and to our recent finding that the MHC gene cluster containing HLA-E in humans has been lost in camels, similarly to cattle and pigs (Plasil et al., 2019). Interestingly, V. pacos seems to be more polymorphic in NKC, at both the genomic and protein levels, despite the limited number of individual genomes analyzed.",

The polymorphism of KIR3DL was similar in the dromedary (seven possible protein variants) and the alpaca (seven functional protein variants), while the alpaca seems to be more variable in the LILRB1 gene (seven vs. three protein variants, respectively).
