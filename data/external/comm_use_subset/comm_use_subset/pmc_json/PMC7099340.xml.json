From serving as a physical barrier [4] to regulating signal transduction pathways [2], they play a key role in cellular protection and homeostasis. Beyond their own direct functions, membranes are also scaffolds upon which proteins associate to stabilize cellular structure [5], promote adhesion [6], and direct transport processes [7], among other functions. As one measure of the membrane interface\u2019s biomedical importance, around 60% of approved drug targets are membrane-associated proteins [8]. In addition, many viral pathogens take advantage of membranes as part of their life cycle. Specifically, membranes serve as a platform for viral proteins to bind to the host cell [9] as well as to organize themselves into complexes that catalyze critical synthesis activities during viral genome replication [10].",

For example, ion channels embedded in lipid membranes may either be stimulated or inhibited by electrical force, mechanical force, or chemical cues [14]. Other therapeutic possibilities include targeting the lipid membrane to modulate its physical properties including permeability [15], as well as disrupting the enzymatic activities of membrane-associated proteins [16] or their interactions with other macromolecule components [17].

A central theme in the engineering sciences is the fundamental characterization of a model biological system by defining the necessary parameters and then systematically evaluating them. Consequently, this approach can help to understand the self-assembly and functional activity of biological systems by easily changing parameters. To facilitate characterization work, model systems are often studied with surface-sensitive analytical tools [24]. A range of techniques exist to probe biological thin film interfaces, and can measure acoustic [25], optical [26], spectroscopic [27], electrical [28], chemical [29], and morphological properties [30].

Indeed, one of the biggest hurdles is the need to identify new molecular targets in order to counter the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. As a case study example of a viral pathogen target, we have selected the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and discuss how engineering strategies identified a previously unknown functional activity encoded within the HCV nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein. By employing a model membrane platform to mimic the host cell membrane interface upon which viral genome replication occurs, a striking ability to lyse lipid vesicles was discovered within the NS5A N-terminal amphipathic, \u03b1-helix (AH) [40\u201343].",

Importantly, these predictions were tested and validated by molecular virology experiments which demonstrated AH peptide has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and dengue virus, as well as many more deadly pathogens [44\u201346]. As such, the AH peptide represents the first in class of lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents. Beyond the identification of this one drug candidate, these studies have also led to the development of a new testing platform to rapidly characterize antiviral drug candidates in minutes. Taken together, model membrane technology demonstrates significant potential for biomedicine, and is yielding new biotechnology and clinical applications to solve a range of important biomedical problems.",

Moreover, while vaccines are available for influenza virus types A and B and for Hepatitis B virus, effective treatment requires additional antiviral drugs, which are still prone to the emergence of viral resistance as well as variable tolerance and efficacies [48]. Most notably, there is no promising vaccine in the pipeline for either HCV or HIV. Nonetheless, these viral pathogens are two of the deadliest. Over 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, while an astounding 170 million people are infected with HCV [49].

While there is a diversity of viruses within this family\u2014dengue, classical swine fever, and viral encephalitis are just a few examples\u2014there are also important common features: they are all small, lipid-enveloped RNA viruses and have many analogous steps in the viral life cycle including host cell entry, viral polyprotein processing, and viral genome replication [51]. Indeed, similar to other Flaviviridae members, HCV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus with a 9.6 kb genome that encodes for a 3010-amino acid long polyprotein [52] (Fig. 2a). Upon translation by the host cell machinery, the nascent polyprotein is then processed by cellular and viral proteases to produce two classes of mature protein: (1) structural components of the mature viron; and (2) nonstructural (NS) proteins that play important roles in viral genome replication [53] (Fig. 2b). Because replication of the HCV genome is error-prone, this process creates genomic diversity that hinders effective treatment of HCV infection. Targeting the NS proteins that mediate replication is an attractive pharmaceutical strategy to halt HCV infection. As there are a wide range of NS proteins, a summary of their properties including membrane association, function, and status as a drug target is presented in Table 1.",

Most of the HCV NS proteins interact together on a membranous platform (termed the \u201cmembranous web\u201d) to form the replicase, a multi-protein complex that directs RNA polymerase activity [55, 57]. As inhibitors of the NS3 protease and NS5B polymerase are entering late-stage clinical trials [58] (see Table 1), it is already becoming clear that additional targets in the HCV replicase need to be identified to minimize the effects of viral resistance on successful clinical treatment [59].

While this protein is implicated in regulating host cell protein activities and modulating virus sensitivity to interferon treatment, it has no known enzymatic function [60\u201362]. Nevertheless, NS5A is a key component of the HCV replicase complex and is necessary for viral replication [63]. Given that HCV replicase activity occurs at the membrane interface, it is interesting that NS5A possesses an N-terminal amphipathic, \u03b1-helix (AH) which is necessary for proper cytoplasmic membrane localization of NS5A in the host cell [64]. Indeed, genetic mutation analysis confirmed that the NS5A AH is necessary for HCV replication [63]. Together, the necessity of NS5A AH for membrane association and viral genome replication suggests that targeting membrane association of NS5A would represent a prime therapeutic target to inhibit replication [65]. Compared to other HCV targets that are prone to viral resistance, the NS5A AH possesses significant sequence homology across all HCV isolates identified to date [64]. Thus, its amphipathic, membrane-associating property is a conserved functional target. The design of a model system to investigate membrane association of the NS5A AH might lead to a viable inhibition strategy.",

There are two main types of model membranes: (1) intact vesicle platform (Fig. 3b); and (2) planar lipid bilayer (Fig. 3c).

It can self-assemble on certain substrates such as mica and silicon oxide by the surface-induced vesicle fusion mechanism\u2014i.e., adsorption and subsequent rupture of lipid vesicles after reaching a critical vesicle concentration on the substrate [70]. Importantly, the platform is intimately associated with the supporting substrate. Collectively, these features have two effects. First, the planar bilayer is rigidly coupled to the substrate and therefore a thin hydration layer exists between the substrate and lower leaflet [34, 71]. Second, the surface pressure of the bilayer increases when peripheral membrane proteins such as phospholipase A2 adsorb to and partially insert themselves into the lipid membrane [72]. This rise in surface pressure can terminate macromolecule adsorption at a lower binding saturation value than that of other model or biological systems [72].",

When spherical lipid vesicles adsorb to substrates such as gold and titanium oxide, they deform but do not rupture [73]. The result is a layer of pancake-like vesicles whose morphology is non-uniform; the intrinsic curvature of this platform surface is important for detecting curvature-sensitive binding of proteins such as those containing BAR domains [74]. The intact vesicle contains hydrodynamically coupled solvent that is encapsulated within its inner core and therefore the layer has viscoelastic properties [75, 76]. As a result, the layer is a soft film that is responsive to the binding of amphipathic macromolecules. Specifically, vesicles can modulate their physical properties in order to maintain a constant surface pressure during the course of a binding interaction [72]. This flexibility enables the determination of binding saturation values that are more representative of biological systems.",

QCM-D enables real-time monitoring of binding kinetics and changes in thin film properties, and is therefore becoming increasingly popular for probing biological interfaces [81\u201383]. The model membrane platform was first assembled on the sensor chip before monitoring membrane association of the AH peptide. For the model membrane studies, a planar bilayer was self-assembled on silicon oxide [70] (Fig. 4a, b). As expected, the AH peptide demonstrated binding to the planar lipid bilayer (Fig. 4a), whereas the control NH peptide did not bind (Fig. 4b). These experiments were in good agreement with past biological results [63, 67], thus establishing a correlation between standard molecular virology techniques and the QCM-D technology. While the binding of peptides and proteins to model membranes has been demonstrated before [84\u201386], the study followed up on these initial experiments by developing a novel biomembrane-on-a-chip platform.",

The adsorption of lipid vesicles onto solid supports results in the self-assembly of different lipid structures. As shown in the previous example, lipid vesicles adsorb and rupture on silicon oxide to form a planar bilayer. By contrast, lipid vesicles adsorb but do not rupture on gold [76]. Instead, the intact vesicles form a stable layer. QCM-D measurements demonstrated that this self-assembly process follows exponential adsorption kinetics, and results in the formation of a stable sensing platform (Fig. 5a). Strikingly, upon addition of AH peptide to the vesicle platform, the intact vesicle layer transformed into a planar bilayer (Fig. 5b). Control experiments with the NH peptide demonstrated that the amphipathic, \u03b1-helical character of the AH peptide is a key determinant of its vesicle-rupturing ability (Fig. 5c) The structural transformation process was also followed directly by AFM imaging in order to measure the height profile of the bare gold surface (Fig. 5d), intact vesicle layer (Fig. 5e), and planar bilayer (Fig. 5f). This analysis confirmed the formation of a planar bilayer on gold.",

First, the maximum binding signal generated by adsorption of AH peptide to the intact vesicle platform is significantly greater than the signal on the planar bilayer platform. In part, this discrepancy may be due to differences in the structural features of a planar bilayer versus layer of intact vesicles. Indeed, in a fixed geometry, intact vesicles would have more available surface area for peptide binding than the planar bilayer. However, when the binding signals are normalized to account for the varying amount of lipid material in the different platforms, the binding signal on the intact vesicle platform is still 2.5 times greater.

On the planar bilayer platform, simple exponential adsorption kinetics is observed with minimal peptide binding. This behavior suggests that the interaction is nonspecifically mediated by the amphipathic nature of the peptide, and that membrane-associated AH peptide exists in the monomeric state. By contrast, interaction of AH peptide with intact vesicles promotes a structural transformation from intact vesicle layer to planar bilayer. The interaction kinetics are complex and show a two-step process. While the Voigt-Voinova model helped to determine the effects of the transformation process on film properties, additional evidence is necessary to understand the mechanism of this process. In this regard, recent work by Hatzakis et al. [93] on the intrinsic property of bilayers to recruit larger densities of amphipathic molecules when highly curved deserves attention.

Higher concentrations of AH peptide are necessary to detect any binding signal on the planar bilayer platform. Taken together with the QCM-D responses, these data support that the transformation of an intact vesicle layer on titanium oxide or gold can result in the formation of a complete, planar bilayer with comparable sensing properties to those of a planar bilayer on the prototypical silicon oxide substrate.

Indeed, complex biological phenomena are difficult to interpret based on a single physical principle. In the case of the interaction between AH peptide and lipid vesicles, the QCM-D energy dissipation signal associated with the vesicle-to-bilayer transformation indicated an intermediate regime of high viscoelasticity. Such a change in film viscoelasticity might occur due to an increase in bound solvent resulting from vesicle swelling, for example. However, the QCM-D technique only senses acoustic mass, which is the combined mass of the adsorbed material (e.g., lipid and/or amino acid) as well as bound solvent. On the basis of this measurement alone, it is not possible to identify how the solvent mass fraction changes during the transformation. To address this challenge, it is therefore important to characterize biointerfacial processes by using several surface-sensitive techniques that measure different physical principles.",

When these two techniques are combined, several parameters can be simultaneously measured as a function of time, including: (1) adsorbed molecular mass (optical mass); (2) adsorbed molecular mass and solvent mass (acoustic mass); (3) effective film thickness; and (4) effective refractive index over the course of time [94]. As a result, the solvent mass can be calculated by separating the acoustic and optical masses.

Large increases in adsorbed mass and energy dissipation are caused by swelling of the vesicles upon interaction with AH peptide. Based on the kinetic differences of the optical and acoustic mass responses, it appears that the binding of AH peptide is necessary but not sufficient to promote the structural transformation. Instead, the AH peptides presumably rearrange on the membrane interface to promote vesicle swelling and destabilization, leading to reassembly and planar bilayer formation. With these mechanistic details revealed, there is now a framework in place to evaluate the biomedical significance of this interaction and to engineer optimized peptides with more potent rupturing activity.",

This size range was selected because zwitterionic lipid vesicles of this diameter easily rupture on silicon oxide [101]. For fundamental characterization of surface-specific adsorption kinetics, the vesicle size was therefore fixed and the variable parameter was the substrate material. This characterization work eventually led to the development of the planar bilayer and intact vesicle platforms which were used for probing AH peptide-mediated vesicle rupturing. In general, the different film properties of these two platforms are sufficient for studying how membrane properties affect these interactions. However, to further evaluate the AH peptide, the intact vesicle platform should be modified to better mimic the properties of lipid-enveloped virus particles. One of the key differences between the particles of different viruses is their size distribution, which is therefore a useful parameter to study. Indeed, one study recently used the intact vesicle platform with the QCM-D assay to determine the vesicle size range within which the AH peptide demonstrates rupturing activity in order to evaluate which viruses the AH peptide may target.",

Based on these results, an evaluation criterion, the degree of vesicle rupturing, was established to assess the rupturing activity of AH peptide against lipid vesicles of varying sizes (Fig. 7c). The rupture percentage provides a general, quantitative framework to measure the performance of other candidate antivirals which target lipid envelopes as well as to identity compounds which abrogate AH peptide\u2019s activity.

While fusion peptides derived from viral envelope proteins have previously been shown to display antiviral activity by either destabilizing lipid envelopes or interfering with fusogenic domains of envelope proteins [102, 103], the AH peptide is neither involved in membrane fusion nor known to interact with other protein domains within the HCV NS5A protein. Furthermore, the NS5A protein is a nonstructural protein that is involved in intracellular HCV genome replication, and is not part of the HCV virion.

Predictions are most valid for viruses that more closely approximate key properties of synthetic lipid vesicles; including: (1) have a lipid envelope; and (2) minimal heterogeneity in particle size. Furthermore, it is not likely that the size corresponding to 100% vesicle rupture is the maximum size at which AH peptide can rupture virus particles. A more probable case is that the rupturing ability of the AH peptide against virus particles occurs on a continuum, as observed in Fig. 7c. Therefore, while the AH peptide may have a greater observed effect on smaller virus particles, it more likely still interacts with larger particles and may affect their infectivity even in the absence of direct rupturing. In addition to this method focused on determining the biophysical mechanism of the AH peptide-mediated vesicle rupturing process in order to predict therapeutic effect, other groups have followed up by confirming the in vitro activity of the AH peptide with molecular virology approaches.",

For clarification, note that the C5A peptide is an 18 amino acid fragment of the full 27 amino acid long N-terminal AH peptide which our team originally described. More detailed analysis revealed that C5A inhibited HCV infection at submicromolar, noncytotoxic concentrations (Fig. 8b). This finding is very important because certain antimicrobial peptides such as dermaseptin and tachyplesin display inhibitory activity against some enveloped viruses, albeit they are not broad-spectrum antivirals and their development is limited as the result of cytotoxicity issues [104]. Compared to daily treatment with recombinant human interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1)\u2014the standard HCV treatment option [105]\u2014C5A inhibited intracellular HCV RNA accumulation almost as effectively by day 5 (Fig. 8c).

In terms of optimization, adjustment of the AH peptide sequence composition will therefore be useful to modulate antiviral potency and therapeutic index [46, 106, 107]. Indeed, Li et al.

With the promising results of a recent Phase I clinical trial for the NS5A-targeting BMS-790052 compound against HCV infection in patients who followed a once-daily, dosing regimen [119], there is huge potential for developing additional inhibition strategies against the NS5A protein. Indeed, the amphipathic character of the AH is conserved across all HCV isolates to date [63, 64, 67], making the AH far less likely to evolve resistance mutations [120, 121]. The QCM-D vesicle rupturing assay could be alternatively used to screen chemical libraries for small molecules that inhibit vesicle rupturing by the NS5A AH peptide. On the same token, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the NS5A AH peptide itself is very attractive for many therapeutic uses, including as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent or even as an immune adjuvant [107].",

All data were collected at the third overtone and normalized. a Intact vesicle adsorption on an oxidized gold surface. After 10 min of stabilization, lipid vesicles were added (arrow 1). After 50 and 55 min, buffer washes were performed in order to test the stability of the film (arrows 2 and 3, respectively). b AH peptide promotes vesicle-to-bilayer transformation. At 60 min (arrow 4), AH peptide was added to the intact vesicle layer on the gold surface. After 120 and 140 min, buffer washes were again performed (arrows 5 and 6, respectively). c NH peptide has no effect on the intact vesicle platform. Identical experiments to those described in Fig. 8b were performed with the control NH peptide, and demonstrated that the NH peptide does not affect the properties of the intact vesicle layer. Morphological effects of AH peptide-mediated vesicle rupture. AFM imaging characterized the vesicle rupturing process on gold. All images are presented in height mode. d Oxidized gold surface. e Adsorbed layer of intact lipid vesicles on the gold surface. f Planar bilayer self-assembles after treatment with the AH peptide. Modeling QCM-D responses for structural transformation from adsorbed vesicles to a planar bilayer. Identical experiments to those described in Fig. 8b were performed. g Resonance frequency responses at multiple overtones were recorded for the vesicle-to-bilayer transformation. h Corresponding energy dissipation responses were also recorded. i Change in film thickness was determined by application of the Sauerbrey equation to the QCM-D data. For comparison, we also present the thicknesses calculated from the Voigt-Voinova model for the intact vesicle layer (22 nm) and planar bilayer (4.4 nm). Note that n = 1 shows fundamental overtones (open squares), n = 3 shows third overtones (open circles), n = 5 shows fifth overtones (open triangles), and n = 7 shows seventh overtones (opposite triangles).

The peptide from the N-terminal region of NS5A displayed the strongest inhibition. b Determination of peptide concentration required to inhibit HCV infection by 50% (IC50). Peptide stock solutions were serially diluted in DMSO and tested for inhibitory activity. Peptide cytotoxic activity was measured MTT cytotoxicity assay. The peptide concentration that reduced the cell growth by 50% was designated as the LC50. c AH peptide analogue prevents initiation of HCV infection and suppresses established infection. Fifteen days after infection of Huh-7 cells, the l- and d-isomers of the AH peptide analogue were added. At the indicated time points, total cellular HCV RNA content was measured. For comparison, the infected cells were treated with 100 U/mL of recombinant human IFN\u03b1. d AH peptide analogue inhibits intracellular HCV particle infectivity. To determine whether the peptide enters cells, a fluorescently labeled version was incubated with Huh-7 cells, and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. e Huh-7 cells previously infected with HCV were treated with d-isomers of AH peptide analogue or DMSO.
