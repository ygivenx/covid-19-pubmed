            "text": "Rapid, sensitive and specific detection of plant pathogens is an important aspect of disease management. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become one of the most commonly-used nucleic acid based methods for the detection of plant pathogens due to its speed, specificity and sensitivity [1]. PCR and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) can be designed to detect a narrow or broad range of targets through the use of specific or degenerate primers and amplified products can be viewed in electrophoretic gels, sequenced directly, and/or cloned. [2\u20134]. The disadvantages of PCR/RT-PCR for pathogen detection are the dependence on a thermocycler, inhibitory effects of co-extracted host plant inhibitors on amplification, and the time investment per sample [5\u20137]. While PCR/RT-PCR assays are used in the detection of plant viruses in research, the cost and time required are too great for many plant disease clinics. Real-time PCR (qPCR), reduces the time required for detection compared to PCR/RT-PCR, but has high start-up and instrument maintenance costs which has discouraged its adoption by many plant disease clinics.",

LAMP is an isothermal reaction that has a sensitivity and specificity similar to that of PCR. LAMP does not require a thermocycler, uses a shorter amplification time than PCR, but like PCR/RT-PCR requires a RNA or DNA template mostly free of host contaminants. However, downstream applications of LAMP products such as direct sequencing, cloning and restriction analysis are more complicated than PCR/RT-PCR, as LAMP generates multimeric products [11].",

            "text": "Another type of isothermal amplification methodology is Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA). RPA was first developed in 2006 and relies on the extension of primers induced by recombination proteins [12]. DNA binding proteins (gp32 single-strand DNA binding protein and two ATP-dependent recombinases, usvX and usvY) bind the primers and scan for the homologous sequence (target). The primers recombine with the target, and a mesophilic polymerase (Bacillus subtilis DNA polymerase I) extend the 3\u2019 end of the invading primer using the opposite strand as a template [12]. RPA reactions have been performed at constant low temperatures (25 \u00b0C to 42 \u00b0C), achieving amplification in as little as 15 min. PCR purification columns remove DNA-binding proteins from the amplicons to allow visualization of results. The use of columns adds to the expense and time required to complete the assay. The most commonly used methods to obtain results of RPA assays are visualization of amplified DNA by gel electrophoresis or amplicon sequencing although alternatives such as fluorescence and/or hybridization have been reported [12\u201314]. In addition to end-point detection of DNA targets, RPA formats have been developed for detection of RNA templates (RT-RPA), target quantification and chip-based detection [13\u201316], which demonstrate the flexibility of this type of assay for rapid pathogen diagnostics. RPA is widely used in the detection of animal and human pathogens [13, 17]. Its use in plant pathogen detection has been limited to four plant pathogens: two viruses, (Little cherry virus 2 (LChV2) and Plum pox virus (PPV)), a bacteria (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (HLB - Las)) and a fungus (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum) ([18, 19] AgDia, Inc. Elkhart, IN).",

This is especially true for emerging viruses such as species in the genus Begomovirus (Family Geminiviridae) [20\u201323]. Species in the genus have been emerging over the last three decades to become plant pathogens that threaten crop production in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. One of these viruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), emerged in the eastern Mediterranean in the 1960s. TYLCV has since spread via the plant trade to virtually all tomato production areas wherever its vector, Bemisia tabaci species complex, is endemic [24]. Current methods for the detection of TYLCV and other begomoviruses are primarily PCR, but other methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), lateral flow immunochromatographic assays, dot blot hybridization, rolling circle amplification (RCA) and LAMP [25\u201333].",

Restriction endonuclease digestion consisted of digestion of amplicons with ClaI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) for 1 h at 37 C and results were visualized in 1.5 % agarose gels.

RPA was able to detect as little as 9.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 g of TYLCV DNA, which was 1000 fold less than that of PCR in the absence of plant contaminants. RPA was able to detect 9.6 pg and PCR was able to detect 9.6 fg of purified TYLCV DNA. In the presence of plant contaminants, PCR was unable to generate visible amplicons, while RPA was able to generate amplicons but with a reduction in sensitivity. However, this was still within an acceptable range as it was equivalent to or greater than that of commonly used diagnostic assays such as ELISA and lateral flow immunochromatographic assays [33]. Our results in the sensitivity of detection of TYLCV DNA using RPA were similar to those reported for transcripts of two RNA plant viruses [18, 19]. In addition, RPA was comparable to PCR in specificity and flexibility for use in downstream applications. Amplicons generated by RPA were readily TA cloned, digested with an endonuclease restriction enzyme, and sequenced directly, as with amplicons generated by PCR, but unlike some other isothermal reactions such as LAMP.",

Results from this study indicate that less expensive and faster methods, such as the use of heat or the addition of SDS, could be used to achieve acceptable results. In addition, the cost and time required to conduct an RPA assay could be reduced by the use of a crude extraction method for the template. Use of these modifications demonstrated that RPA can be used as an assay for the detection of plant pathogens for the same cost and in less time than PCR with adequate sensitivity, and without sacrificing specificity or flexibility for use in downstream applications.",
