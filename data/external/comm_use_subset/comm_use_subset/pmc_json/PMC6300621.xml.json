Case-fatality rates were reported to be as high as 65% to 80% in some case series prior to the development of effective antibiotic treatment (1, 2). Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment are often associated with fatal cases (3, 4). The incidence of reported spotted fever group infections in the United States has increased dramatically since the early 21st century (2, 5). The clinical manifestations of rickettsial diseases usually include fever, headache, and rash. Severe cases develop interstitial pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, and multiorgan failure leading to death. Pathogenic rickettsiae are introduced into the skin via an arthropod vector and are then spread via the lymphatics to draining lymph nodes and disseminate hematogenously to infect microvascular endothelial cells systemically, further leading to increased microvascular permeability (6). Although rickettsial infections have been studied for more than 100 years, the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of rickettsial diseases remain incompletely understood.",

            "text": "To understand the pathogenic mechanisms of disease caused by spotted fever group rickettsiae after a tick bite, we aimed to investigate the interactions of rickettsiae with their initial target cells. Accumulating evidence from clinical specimens suggests that mononuclear phagocytes, most likely macrophages, are the initial targets for rickettsiae at the onset of the disease: (i) histopathological studies showed that mononuclear cells were infected in the skin inoculation site in a patient infected with Rickettsia parkeri (7), and (ii) immunohistochemical examination demonstrated that the predominant infected cells in the skin lesions of patients with rickettsialpox are CD68-positive mononuclear phagocytes (8). Thus, macrophages most likely serve as the initial targets for rickettsiae in the tick feeding site. Macrophages are key sentinels of the innate immune system and are tasked with detecting and responding to pathogens. Interestingly, the accumulation of both spotted fever and typhus group rickettsiae in macrophage-like cells is closely associated with their virulence (9\u201312). Typically, virulent R. conorii survives and proliferates in human macrophage-like cells, while nonvirulent R. montanensis is rapidly destroyed (9). Macrophages isolated from mice resistant to R. akari infection show rickettsicidal activity, while those from a susceptible mouse strain are defective in killing rickettsiae (13). R. typhi and R. akari, which are genetically less related to spotted fever group rickettsial species, initiate differential expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), in macrophages/monocytes (14). However, it is unclear why macrophages cannot efficiently clear the intracellular rickettsiae. These issues and the questions of how rickettsiae survive in macrophages and are subsequently potentially disseminated systemically by macrophages are important to understanding the pathogenesis of rickettsial diseases.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an intracellular, bulk degradation process in which a portion of a cytoplasmic component of the cell is engulfed in double-membrane-bound structures, known as autophagosomes, and subsequently degraded upon fusion with lysosomes (15, 16). Autophagosome formation requires 16 autophagy-related (Atg) genes, including Atg5, which comprise a ubiquitin-like conjugation system (17). Another ubiquitin-like conjugation system, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-ATG8), is also required in autophagosomal elongation (18). The conversion of a cytosolic truncated form of LC3 (LC3-I) to its autophagosomal membrane-associated, phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3-II), visible as discrete puncta by immunofluorescent analysis, indicates autophagosome formation (19). The protein lipidation system resulting in LC3-II is driven by the Atg5-Atg12-Atg16 complex acting as an E3 ligase equivalent that facilitates the localized conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II (20), although as the key marker of autophagy, autophagosome-independent LC3 organelles have been described (21). The cargo enveloped by autophagosomes is normally further delivered to autolysosomes for degradation. However, intracellular bacteria have developed a variety of strategies to subvert autophagosomes for the benefit of replication (22, 23). All members of the genus Rickettsia are capable of invading host cells and escaping phagosomal vacuoles as quickly as 30 min after infection (24\u201327). To us, it is important to investigate how Rickettsia interacts with the membrane compartments involved in the autophagy pathway in the cytosol of host cells after escaping capture by phagosomes.",

The pathological changes seen in R. australis-infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice mimic those seen in human spotted fever rickettsioses, and R. australis-infected B6 mice represent an excellent model of severe rickettsial infection (28, 29). By using this murine model of rickettsioses, we have previously identified the critical roles of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and MyD88 in host protective immunity against rickettsial infection (29, 30). We also mechanistically investigated the in vivo contribution of NLRP3, an inflammasome known to mediate the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, to host immunity against R. australis using B6-background gene-knockout mice (31). In the present study, we employed B6-background conditional-gene-knockout mice, Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre and Atg5flox/flox mice, in which Atg5 is deficient mainly in macrophages. We report a new host gene by which rickettsiae manipulate mammalian macrophages to promote the infection in vivo. Our results demonstrate that Atg5 in macrophages favors R. australis infection both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that Atg5 supports R. australis infection in macrophages in association with inhibition of the production of IL-1\u03b2 but not active autophagy flux. Thus, Atg5 in macrophages appears to contribute greatly to the progression of rickettsial diseases.",

            "text": "Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice have been developed and employed in previous studies (32\u201334). Briefly, the Atg5 gene was deleted from monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes by breeding Atg5flox/flox mice (33) to mice expressing the Cre recombinase from the endogenous lysozyme M locus to generate Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice. Deletion of the Atg5 gene in these cells results in a deficit in autophagy (32\u201334). To determine the physiological importance of Atg5 in R. australis infection in vivo, we challenged Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre and Atg5flox/flox mice with R. australis intravenously (i.v.). Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice were less supportive for the in vivo\nR. australis infection than Atg5flox/flox mice, as evidenced by lower rickettsial loads in tissues (Fig. 1A and B). Immunohistochemical staining with an antibody (Ab) directed against ATG5 confirmed the deficiency of ATG5 in host granulocytes/macrophages (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, the quantity of R. australis in the spleens of infected mice was determined by immunohistochemical analysis using an Ab against rickettsiae. On day 4 postinfection (p.i.), the number of rickettsiae (stained in red and shown with white arrows in Fig. 1A) was dramatically greater in the spleens of Atg5flox/flox mice than in those of Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice. Consistent with these results, we found that the concentrations of R. australis in the liver, lung, and spleen of Atg5flox/flox mice were significantly greater than those in the organs of Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 1B). The concentrations of R. australis in mice deficient in Atg5 in macrophages were reduced approximately 90% in lung, 56% in liver, and 75% in spleen compared to those in the organs of Atg5flox/flox mice. One of the major characteristics of mouse models of rickettsial infection is the progression of the disease resulting from the progressively increased bacterial replication, measured by quantitative real-time PCR, in the various infected tissues in vivo (30, 35, 36). Although we did not show the concentrations of R. australis in tissues at time points earlier than day 4 p.i., the greater concentrations in lung, liver, and spleen in Atg5-competent mice than in those in Atg5-deficient mice most likely suggest that Atg5 is required for the significant expansion of R. australis\nin vivo. Interestingly, a deficiency of Atg5 in macrophages resulted in significantly enhanced in vivo levels of IL-1\u03b2 in R. australis-infected mice compared to those in their Atg5-competent counterparts (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Atg5 expression in macrophages negatively regulates the in vivo production of IL-1\u03b2 during R. australis infection. As a control, we did not observe any significantly different levels of IL-6 production in the sera of infected Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice and Atg5flox/flox mice (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Atg5 in macrophages specifically inhibits the levels of IL-1\u03b2 production in vivo during R. australis infection. Thus, our results clearly demonstrate that Atg5 expression in macrophages favors R. australis infection in vivo, which results in a greater bacterial load. Autophagy-related genes, including Atg5, have been reported to suppress proinflammatory cytokines in a variety of infection models (37\u201340). Thus, we hypothesized that Atg5 in macrophages favors R. australis infection in vivo in association with the specific inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2.",

It is known that peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice lack Atg5 (41). We first determined whether Atg5 is involved in the accumulation of R. australis in BMMs. As shown in Fig. 2A, at 30 min p.i., no significant difference in the rickettsial loads in the BMMs of Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice and Atg5flox/flox mice was detected (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the initial concentrations of intracellular R. australis in the macrophages of Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice and those of Atg5flox/flox mice. Interestingly, at 48 h p.i., the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in the BMMs of Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice were significantly less (approximately 40%) than those in the BMMS of Atg5flox/flox mice (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the increased concentrations of R. australis in Atg5flox/flox BMMs compared with those in Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs results from enhanced host cell viability, we examined the viability of BMMs from these transgenic mice at 48 h p.i. We did not observe significant cell death in either R. australis-infected Atg5flox/flox BMMs or infected Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs (Fig. S2) by flow cytometric analysis.

To address this question, we treated R. australis-infected Atg5flox/flox BMMs and Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs with exogenous recombinant IL-1\u03b2. At 48 h p.i., the concentrations of R. australis in Atg5flox/flox BMMs treated with recombinant IL-1\u03b2 were significantly less than those in untreated cells (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that exogenous IL-1\u03b2 plays a part in reducing the concentration of rickettsiae in Atg5flox/flox BMMs, mostly likely through inhibiting the accumulation of R. australis. Interestingly, the greater concentrations of R. australis in Atg5flox/flox BMMs than in Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs were abolished by treatment with IL-1\u03b2. However, the concentrations of R. australis in Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs were not altered upon treatment with recombinant IL-1\u03b2. It is possible that R. australis is not able to accumulate or grow in the absence of Atg5 by an IL-1\u03b2-independent mechanism. To address this issue, we evaluated the rickettsial loads in cells treated with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1\u03b2 and their corresponding IgG controls. Our results showed that Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs treated with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1\u03b2, but not those treated with the IgG controls, contained concentrations of intracellular R. australis comparable to those in Atg5flox/flox BMMs (Fig. 3B). The concentrations of intracellular R. australis in Atg5-deficient BMMs increased upon treatment with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1\u03b2 compared with those in the IgG controls (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that R. australis is able to accumulate in the absence of Atg5 in association with the IL-1\u03b2-mediated response. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-1\u03b2 did not alter the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in Atg5-competent BMMs. Therefore, these results suggest that the increased Atg5-dependent accumulation of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages is closely associated with a reduced IL-1\u03b2-mediated inhibitory effect on rickettsiae.",

The conversion of LC3-I to lipidated LC3-II is a hallmark of autophagy and indicates autophagosome formation (42). The amount of LC3-II correlates directly with the number of autophagosomes. However, LC3 has also been shown to accumulate independently of autophagosomes (43). At 1 h p.i., but not 3 h p.i., R. australis induced a significantly increased level of LC3-II in Atg5-competent (Atg5flox/flox) macrophages compared to those in the uninfected controls (Fig. 4A and B). However, since LC3-II itself is degraded by autophagy, an increased number of autophagosomes may represent either induction of autophagy or blockade of any step downstream of autophagosome formation. To address this issue, we examined the levels of p62/SQSTM1, a ubiquitin-binding protein that is specifically degraded by autolysosomes. p62/SQSTM1 is considered a useful marker for autophagic vesicle turnover (44), as the level of p62/SQSTM1 is inversely correlated with autophagy flux. At both 1 h and 3 h p.i., R. australis did not induce a significantly reduced level of p62/SQSTM1 in Atg5flox/flox BMMs compared to that in the uninfected controls (Fig. 4A and B). These results suggest that R. australis induced a modified autophagy process without active autophagic vesicle turnover in Atg5-competent BMMs.",

To this end, we studied the interplay of R. australis with autophagy in BMMs isolated from B6 mice at the ultrastructural level. Transmission electron microscopy is the most traditional method to study mammalian autophagy. An autophagosome is defined as a double-membrane-enclosed vacuole containing undigested cytoplasmic contents (42). At the ultrastructural level, in R. australis-infected BMMs, we regularly found individual intact rickettsiae or groups of rickettsiae in vacuoles surrounded by double membranes (indicated by arrows) at both 1 h p.i. (Fig. 5A and B) and 3 h p.i. (Fig. 5C and D) around at least a part of their circumference. Rickettsiae (indicated by arrowheads) were found inside these vacuoles (Fig. 5). These autophagosome-related vesicles were observed in multiple fields and nonserial sections but not in the negative controls. Some autophagosomes had only fragments of inner membrane (Fig. 5A, B, and D, arrows), suggesting that they were either gradually transforming into autophagolysosomes or generated due to a block that occurred after autophagosome formation.",

Our previous studies have shown a high infection rate in both R. conorii- and R. australis-infected mammalian host cells (31, 45). As shown in Fig. 6C, R. australis (red) was detected in the cytosol (nucleus as blue) of most (more than 90%) of the infected BMMs, whereas it was not found in the uninfected controls, suggesting that these bacteria showed a substantial infectivity rate in primary murine macrophages. In line with the results obtained by immunoblotting, confocal immunofluorescence microscopic analysis demonstrated LC3-positive organelles or LC3 puncta (green) in R. australis-infected BMMs at both 1 h and 3 h p.i. (Fig. 6C). To further determine the association of these LC3-positive organelles with R. australis, we examined their colocalization with R. australis. Some of these LC3-positive organelles, labeled green, colocalized with R. australis in the cytosol, shown in yellow (Fig. 6C and D). Quantitatively, the LC3 puncta were numerous and significantly increased at 1 h p.i. compared to their levels in the uninfected controls (Fig. 6C and E). At 3 h p.i., the quantity of LC3 puncta was substantial but not significantly different from that in the uninfected controls (Fig. 6E). About 36.9% \u00b1 9.9% of infected cells contained LC3 puncta at 1 h p.i., and their levels were significantly decreased at 3 h p.i. (Fig. 6F). Further quantitative analysis revealed that 20.1% \u00b1 8.1% of rickettsiae colocalized with autophagosomes at 1 h p.i. (Fig. 6G). These results suggest that autophagy-related compartments, presumably autophagosomes, accumulated at the very early stage of infection. Only a small proportion of rickettsiae were associated with these autophagosomes, although almost all of the cells were infected with rickettsiae. It remains unknown why only part of the infected cells contained LC3 puncta and why a small portion of rickettsiae were colocalized with an LC3-positive compartment.",

To answer this question, we examined the concentrations of rickettsiae in BMMs treated with rapamycin, a classic autophagy inducer. Autophagy is negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and can be induced in all mammalian cell types by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (46). WT BMMs were pretreated with a low concentration of rapamycin and then infected with R. australis. We did not find any significant cell death in BMMs treated with rapamycin. At 30 min p.i., we did not find any significant difference in the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in rapamycin-treated BMMs from those in untreated cells (Fig. 7A). These results suggest that autophagy induction by rapamycin does not have an impact on the concentrations of intracellular rickettsiae at the beginning of the infection. However, at 48 h p.i., the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in rapamycin-treated BMMs were significantly greater than those in the untreated controls (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that autophagy induction promotes R. australis infection, in line with our results obtained using BMMs from Atg5-conditional-knockout mice (Fig. 2A). These data indirectly suggest that the enhanced concentrations of intracellular R. australis in Atg5-competent BMMs are associated with a host autophagic response, although further investigations are required to reveal the mechanisms involved.",

More strikingly, Atg5 expression in macrophages contributes to the pathogenesis of rickettsial diseases. Atg5 supports the accumulation of R. australis in macrophages in association with downregulation of the inhibitory effect on rickettsiae mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2. R. australis promotes the accumulation of Atg5-dependent LC3 but does not actively induce an autophagic flux in primary mouse macrophages at the very early stage of infection. Furthermore, our data suggest that exogenous induction of autophagy facilitates R. australis infection in macrophages, as evidenced by significantly increased concentrations of intracellular rickettsiae in response to treatment with rapamycin. Although it is not completely clear how R. australis exploits Atg5-mediated mechanisms to support bacterial infection in macrophages, our studies reveal that Atg5, a gene with a previously unknown function in rickettsial infection, could potentially serve as a target for the design of therapeutic strategies for rickettsioses in the future.",

It is still poorly understood how rickettsiae modulate macrophage behavior to facilitate the progression of the diseases. Our studies employed conditional-knockout mice to investigate cell-specific mechanisms mediating the pathogenesis of rickettsial disease. Although macrophages have been shown to be of principal interest in these conditional-knockout mice, Atg5-deficient Lyz-expressing cells other than macrophages, such as neutrophils, are also possibly involved in controlling rickettsial infection in Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice in vivo. Our results, more strikingly, recapitulated the in vitro Atg5-dependent infection by R. australis in macrophages in a mouse model of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (28). Therefore, it is most likely that macrophages are the responsible cells mediating the difference in rickettsial bacterial burdens in vivo in these conditional-knockout mice. Since rickettsiae primarily target microvascular endothelial cells, future investigations are required to identify whether changes in rickettsial concentration in tissues are due only to cell-intrinsic effects of the Atg5 gene on rickettsial infection in macrophages and/or to the effects of Atg5 genes acting in trans from macrophages to endothelial cells.",

            "text": "Our findings illustrate that R. australis exploits Atg5-mediated mechanisms to support bacterial infection in association with dampening of the IL-1\u03b2-mediated antirickettsial effect in macrophages. IL-1\u03b2-mediated bacterial killing has been demonstrated in infections of macrophages with other extracellular bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (47). Although the concentrations of intracellular R. australis were significantly reduced in response to treatment with IL-1\u03b2 in Atg5-competent macrophages, it is unclear whether IL-1\u03b2 is capable of exerting rickettsial killing activity. Future studies quantifying live R. australis bacteria in Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs versus Atg5flox/flox BMMs at early and later time points will further reveal whether Atg5 supports the replication or survival of R. australis in macrophages. Interestingly, treatment with exogenous IL-1\u03b2 failed to inhibit the accumulation of R. australis in Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs (Fig. 3). Why? We propose that Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs are fully activated by a large amount of IL-1\u03b2 produced upon R. australis infection in an autocrine manner, which may result in inhibition of the intracellular growth of R. australis. Thus, Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs were unable to respond to stimulation with exogenous IL-1\u03b2 due to the full autocrine activation. In contrast, infected Atg5flox/flox BMMs produced a minimal level of IL-1\u03b2, which may not be sufficient for autocrine activation of macrophages. In response to exogenous recombinant IL-1\u03b2, Atg5flox/flox BMMs exhibited an antirickettsial effect leading to a reduced concentration of intracellular R. australis. More strikingly, the greater rickettsial loads in Atg5flox/flox versus Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs were abrogated by treatment with exogenous recombinant IL-1\u03b2. These results suggest that inhibition of the IL-1\u03b2-mediated antirickettsial effect is associated with the Atg5-dependent accumulation of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages. Interestingly, no difference in the intracellular concentrations of R. australis was observed in Atg5flox/flox BMMs upon treatment with antibodies against IL-1\u03b2. These observations could be explained by the possibility that there was a minimal amount of IL-1\u03b2 present to be neutralized by the antibodies. In addition, a deficiency in Atg5 in infected macrophages enhanced the production of IL-1\u03b2 by about 20% compared to the amount produced by infected Atg5-competent macrophages (Fig. 2B). However, addition of IL-1\u03b2 reduced the concentrations of intracellular rickettsiae in Atg5flox/flox BMMs by nearly 50% (Fig. 3). These results suggest that effectors other than IL-1\u03b2 may also contribute to controlling intracellular R. australis in macrophages. Therefore, our data suggest that Atg5 contributes to the intracellular infection of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages in close association with downregulation of the inhibitory effect on rickettsiae mediated by autocrine-secreted IL-1\u03b2.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have identified Atg genes in macrophages to be key regulators of inflammation (37, 38, 48). Atg genes in macrophages are known to limit innate immune inflammation. In contrast, induced autophagy is also reported to augment IL-1\u03b2 secretion (49). In the present study, deletion of the Atg5 gene in macrophages resulted in elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 but not those of IL-6 during rickettsial infection (Fig. 1C). Our recent studies have demonstrated that R. australis activates the caspase-1-dependent inflammasome, which mediates the production of biologically functional IL-1\u03b2 by macrophages (31). Therefore, the significantly enhanced levels of production of IL-1\u03b2 by Atg5flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs suggest that Atg5 possibly plays a negative role in the activation of the inflammasome but not IL-6-mediated inflammation during rickettsial infection. It remains unknown whether the autophagosome is involved in inhibiting the inflammasome pathway during R. australis infection. Recent studies have demonstrated a general role of TRIMs as autophagic receptor regulators in regulating the immune response, with MEFV/TRIM20 specializing in the suppression of inflammasome and caspase-1 activation, leading to IL-1\u03b2 production (50). As a cytosolic multiprotein complex, inflammasomes specifically detect danger signals and infectious pathogens in the cytosol. As bacteria residing free in the cytosol, a portion of the R. australis bacteria colocalized with autophagosomes at 1 h p.i. but did not induce active autophagy flux. These results lead us to the hypothesis that Atg5-dependent autophagosomes provide a shelter for these cytosolic bacteria, preventing them from being recognized by inflammasomes. Furthermore, the Atg5-dependent, autophagy-independent regulation of inflammation has also been reported (41). Thus, our results do not exclude the possibility that Atg5 also favors R. australis infection in macrophages through an autophagy-independent mechanism.",

Listeria monocytogenes is not normally a target for autophagy and is taken into the autophagic pathway only when bacterial protein synthesis is inhibited (51). It is presumed that the very small percentage of dead R. australis bacteria generated in the process of purification is associated with the induction of autophagosomes. Future studies using R. australis bacteria treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or chloramphenicol, will help us to reveal the role of de novo protein synthesis by rickettsiae in the development of bacterium-associated autophagosomes. In addition, further investigations should focus on whether the autophagosomes observed in R. australis-infected BMMs result from blockage of the maturation of autolysosomes, which will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which rickettsiae subvert the active autophagic response.",

Rickettsia australis accumulated autophagosomes as early as 1 h p.i., which were then evaded by rickettsiae at 3 h p.i. Thus, our current results suggest that the accumulation of autophagosomes by R. australis occurred as a rapid, transient, and dynamic response. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) begins to colocalize with green fluorescent protein-LC3 at 3 h p.i. (52). Coxiella burnetii inclusions accumulate LC3 at 5 min p.i. (53). Orientia tsutsugamushi induces LC3 puncta at 2 h p.i. but actively escapes from autophagic recognition so that inhibition or activation of autophagy does not affect its intracellular growth (54, 55). Anaplasma phagocytophilum colocalizes with LC3 and Beclin 1 at 32 and 48 h p.i., respectively (22). Ehrlichia chaffeensis induces autophagy at 3 days p.i. (56, 57). C. burnetii recruits LC3 to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), within which C. burnetii uniquely replicates (58). However, no change in the levels of p62/SQSTM1 is observed in C. burnetii-infected macrophages (58), which is similar to what we observed in R. australis-infected macrophages (Fig. 1 and 4). Winchell et al. recently demonstrated that C. burnetii exploits the p62/SQSTM1-regulated host signaling pathway for intramacrophage growth (59). Our study clearly indicated that macrophages did not control R. australis infection but, instead, supported its accumulation in an Atg5-dependent fashion. These results were further confirmed by the greater accumulation of R. australis in macrophages upon stimulation with the classic autophagy inducer, rapamycin. To further determine whether the phenotype that we observed is only due to Atg5, we compared the rickettsial concentrations in BMMs of Atg16l1flox/flox and Atg16l1flox/flox-LysMCre mice. Similar to our results in Atg5-deficient macrophages, deletion of Atg16l1 significantly reduced the concentrations of R. australis (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Thus, our results clearly demonstrated a role of autophagy-related genes in supporting the infection of R. australis in macrophages. In our previous studies, R. conorii has been reported to be engulfed in autophagosomes and destroyed in structures resembling autolysosomes (60, 61). These results were obtained in mouse microvascular endothelial cells treated with cytokines, including gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which are known to be major immune effectors with rickettsicidal effects (62). Compared to the previous studies, the present studies greatly helped us with understanding the pathogenic mechanisms in vivo, before adaptive immunity is initiated, by focusing on the initial target cells of rickettsiae and on a state without external stimuli.",
