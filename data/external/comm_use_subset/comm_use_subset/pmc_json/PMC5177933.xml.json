No structural changes in the DE loop were predicted between the L1 homology models representing the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes compared to HPV16 (Fig. 1c).

It was reasoned that the L1 loops of the non-vaccine genotypes which presented a similar topography to the corresponding L1 loop of HPV16, were more likely to be recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies. Based upon this rationale, the DE loop was considered to be a candidate for further investigation based upon the predicted structural similarity between the DE loops of all the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes compared to HPV16 (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the frequency of predicted structural divergence observed between the BC and EF loops (Fig. 1b,d) of the non-vaccine genotypes and HPV16 negated any further investigation of these two loops. Both the FG and HI loops (Fig. 1e,f) were chosen for further investigation based upon their predicted structural similarity between HPV16 and the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotype HPV31 which is frequently recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies2333.",

The loop swaps were made between HPV31, a genotype recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies and HPV35, which was chosen as the background control since cross-neutralising antibodies demonstrate minimal recognition of this genotype. The number of amino acid residues which were substituted between HPV31 and HPV35 differed between the three loops. The DE, which is the longest L1 loop, only had five positions where the residues varied between HPV31 and HPV35. The thirty residue long FG loop had eleven variable positions whilst the HI, which is the shortest L1 loop, varied at nine of its sixteen amino acid positions. The L1L2 PsV with either a HPV31 or HPV35 backbone and single (DE, FG & HI), double (DEFG, DEHI & FGHI) or triple (DEFGHI) loop swaps (Fig. 2a) generated similarly-sized particles and particle-to-infectivity (PI) ratios.

Amino acid residues within the L1 loops also appear to play critical roles in maintaining capsid stability36 and initiating virus-host interactions9 which may account for the structural similarity predicted between HPV16 and the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes in some L1 loops. The computer modelling of L1-L2 protein interactions suggests that regions of the DE and FG loops interact with proline-rich regions of the L236 whilst a cysteine residue within the EF loop is crucial for the formation of inter-capsomeric L1-L1 disulphide bonds637.

            "text": "The chimeric L1L2 PsV demonstrated that the FG loop is necessary and sufficient for the epitope footprints of a significant proportion of cross-neutralising antibody specificities and that the DE loop appears to enhance this recognition. The HI loop appeared not to contribute towards cross-neutralising antibody recognition. Two or more L1 loops appear to contribute towards the majority of identified L1 MAb epitopes, although there are instances where a single loop has supported an epitope footprint, for example the BC loop alone is targeted by some HPV6, HPV33 and HPV16 L1 MAbs455051. The epitope footprints of four neutralising HPV16 MAbs have recently been resolved using cryo-electron microscope analysis and demonstrated for the first time that, alongside FG and HI loop residues, residues in the DE loop formed the core of each epitope with minor contributions from residues in the BC and EF loops1415. Amino acid residues within the DE loop also formed the majority of the epitope footprint recognised by the HPV16 neutralising human MAb 26D1, which was isolated from a HPV vaccine recipient52. In this present study, we found that the DE loop of HPV31 enhanced cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the HPV31 FG loop within the HPV35 L1 backbone. This enhancement may result from DE loop residues functioning as part of the epitope footprint or maybe due to DE loop interactions which support the optimum presentation of the FG loop.",

The early region of the FG loop is known to harbour residues involved in the epitope footprints of type-specific, neutralising HPV31 MAbs16 whilst the late region contains the majority of residues involved in the epitope footprints of type-specific, neutralising HPV16 MAbs14. The data in this study appear to demonstrate that the late region of the FG loop harbours the amino acid residues recognised by HPV vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies and that direct overlap exists with residues in the HPV16 type-specific antibody footprints. This observation suggests that HPV31 type-specific antibodies and HPV31 cross-neutralising antibodies generated against HPV16 recognise different L1 domains and that the domain recognised by HPV31 cross-neutralising antibodies is subdominant within the epitope footprint of HPV16 type-specific antibodies.",
