Improvements in sequencing technology and the concomitant decrease in costs have made it easier and more common for the re-sequencing of large genomes as well as parallel sequencing of small genomes. This has led to an exponential increase in the genomic data available in public databases. However, accurate gene prediction is a challenge that has created a bottleneck in the gene predication pipeline.",

            "text": "Two major approaches, ab initio gene finding and similarity-based prediction [1], have been commonly applied to gene prediction. The ab initio method, also known as the intrinsic statistical strategy, computes statistical data such as the nucleotide frequencies and their ordering in a set of genomic sequences that have been characterized. This is because the nucleotide frequencies and ordering for each genome usually differ between protein coding and non-coding regions. However, viral genomes, because of their small genome sizes, may not provide sufficient training data to derive the parameters necessary to attain the best performance possible for this approach. The heuristic method, which determines the parameters of the necessary models from short sequences, was adopted by several gene prediction programs, e.g., GeneMarkS [2]. Small amount of genomic sequence, but long enough to produce the efficient Markov models, usually a small fraction of large genome or small genomes like viral genomes, is needed for this method. The linear function reflecting the relationship between the nucleotide frequencies in the three codon positions and the global nucleotide frequencies is obtained by analyzing the small amount of DNA sequence. These derived data will be used to predict protein coding genes by the heuristic method [3]. The ab initio method uses these trained or self-trained modules to select the protein coding regions and predict coding sequences. The similarity-based method predicts protein coding sequences by a different strategy, identifying gene coding sequences by sequence similarity alignment to reference sequences which are closely related evolutionarily. Since these two approaches use different strategies to detect the protein coding sequences, the performances are different and depend on the training data set and reference sequence data. Usually, ab initio approach is more sensitive than similarity-based approach, while the performance of similarity-based method has greater specificity. This is because ab initio methods predict some false positive exons and genes in intergenic regions and introns, while similarity-based tools cannot detect genes if the homologous sequences are not included in the reference data.",

For example, introns, alternative splicing, overlapping genes, and ribosomal slippage exist in many viral genomes. Thus an all purpose gene finder cannot be easily adapted for gene prediction across all virus families. However, if the genome scaffold and the gene features of a viral genome are well understood, a similarity-based gene prediction approach based on the curated gene repertoire for a specific virus genus with attention to particular recognition features, such as, splice sites and mature peptide cleavage sites can be adapted, and perform better than an ab initio gene finder.",

One of the goals of the GSCID is high throughput sequencing of various viral pathogens. The viral genome sequencing projects at JCVI have resulted in publication of more than 4000 influenza virus genomes from clinical and animal reservoir specimens, and hundreds of coronavirus and rotavirus sequences. Prediction of protein coding genes encoded in these viral genomes is a critical step to understanding these pathogenic viruses. In order to have a flexible, accurate gene prediction tool for utilization in high throughput viral genome sequencing projects, we developed a viral annotation program, VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader). VIGOR uses a similarity-based approach to detect open reading frames (ORF) in various viral genomes by similarity searches against custom reference protein sequence databases. VIGOR takes into account differences between the genomic structures of viral taxonomic groups. VIGOR is tailored for the designated viruses with complex gene features such as splicing and frame-shifting, and it is able to predict genes accurately in influenza (group A, B, and C), coronavirus (including SARS coronavirus), rhinovirus, and rotavirus genomes. It was also designed to assign function to the predicted ORFs and genotype influenza viruses. In addition to gene prediction, VIGOR can also be used as a tool to validate sequence accuracy and completeness during the genome finishing process.",

These predictions were marked as discrepancies in Table 1. Nine small ORFs detected by FLAN were missing from the VIGOR prediction list; all of these were homologous to PB1-F2 protein. These PB1-F2 proteins predicted by FLAN were manually compared to the homologous PB1-F2 sequences. It was found that multiple stop codons are present in the region homologous to the N-terminal domain of PB1-F2. Although the annotations in GenBank for 6 of these nine sequences are same as FLAN predictions, most likely all these nine sequences encode non-functional PB1-F2 genes.",

Since there were no annotations for most of these genomes in GenBank, SARS-CoV genome TOR2 genome was annotated in GenBank and predictions were listed [29], a detail comparison was done for this genome (data not shown). The predictions of VIGOR for SARS-CoV genome TOR2 were exactly same as the GenBank annotations. GeneDeciper didn't pick 6 small non-structural protein genes and predicted one gene incorrectly. The genome structure and genes of the other 16 tested SARS-CoV genomes are same as SARS-CoV genome TOR 2, 14 genes and one non-functional non-structural protein gene were detected in these genomes by VIGOR.",

In this role, VIGOR is used to detect sequence changes which generate a premature stop codon or a frameshift. The potential sequence error and the flanking sequences as well as the BLASTX alignment results are presented in the prediction output. This data allows researchers working on finishing tasks to investigate whether the sequence changes are due to laboratory error or are biologically relevant SNPs or IN/DELs. We noticed that if a mutation or a sequence error generates a pre-mature stop codon or causes frame-shift, and the translated product still meets all criteria stated above, VIGOR will predict this gene as a functional gene. In this type of cases, VIGOR prediction may not be able to identify the potential sequence errors. However, VIGOR provides the alignment data between the predicted peptide and reference sequence in the output alignment file, users can use the alignment data to evaluate the prediction and identify the potential sequence errors. If a genomic sequence covers only a fraction of a gene coding region, VIGOR will identify this genomic sequence as partial sequence. Genome finishing team is able to pursue finishing the genome basing the missing regions identified by VIGOR.",

VIGOR has been employed to predict the protein coding genes successfully for 51 newly sequenced group A rotavirus complete genomes sequenced at JCVI [30] and to annotate and predict mature peptides for 66 rhinovirus full genome sequences [21]. The similarity based program has been also used to annotate the published sequences of bovine, feline, human, murine, rat, SARS and several novel wild animal coronavirus genomes [22-25].

Genes with introns, overlapping genes, and even the genes with a frameshift due to ribosomal slippage can be identified accurately because VIGOR includes these complex mechanisms in the processing for the designated genomes. Both the specificity and sensitivity of VIGOR for the tested genomes was greater than 99%. The same sets of viral genomes were tested for two existing universal viral gene predication methods, the specificity was between 31% and 95%, and the sensitivity was from 35% to 96%. VIGOR was designed to predict the mature peptides accurately for rhinovirus genomes and SARS coronavirus genomes, which is not applicable for the existing universal gene prediction tools. VIGOR can also conduct genotyping and assign function to the predicted protein, both of which are not capable for most available viral gene prediction tools. This user-friendly program is convenient for high throughput sequencing projects and for use by individual laboratories. If reference protein sequences can be collected, and genome specific features are added to VIGOR, this program can extend its capability to predict the protein coding genes in many other small viral genomes.",
