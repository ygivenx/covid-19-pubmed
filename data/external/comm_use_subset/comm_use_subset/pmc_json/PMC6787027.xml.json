            "text": "Ribosome frameshifting is a recoding event that causes ribosome slippage along the mRNA and changes the sequence of the synthesized protein. Frameshifting can direct the ribosome into \u22121, +1, \u22122, or even +4 frame, but the most common type is \u22121 frameshifting1\u20134. Spontaneous ribosome slippage is a rare event that occurs, on average, once in 104\u2013105 codons5,6. This low spontaneous frameshifting increases dramatically on particular mRNAs that contain sequences for programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). PRF requires a slippery sequence, which usually comprises a X XXY YYZ heptamer, where XXX and YYY are triplets of identical bases and Z is any nucleotide, which allows for cognate pairing of the P-site and A-site tRNAs in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame7\u20139. The nature of the tRNAs bound to the slippery site codons is critical, including the modifications of nucleotides in the anticodon loop (i.e., at positions 34 and 37 of the tRNA)8,10,11. Frameshifting is facilitated by mRNA elements that slow down the ribosome progression along the mRNA, such as secondary structures (stem loops or pseudoknots) downstream of the slippery site. \u22121PRF is common in viruses and is found also in bacteria and eukaryotes12\u201314, where it is employed to increase the coding capacity of the genome, define stoichiometry of translation products or to regulate the lifetime of the mRNA.",

Ensemble kinetics and smFRET studies suggested that \u22121PRF occurs predominantly during the translocation step when the two tRNAs in the A and P sites move to the P and E sites, respectively16\u201321. Displacement of the tRNAs weakens the interactions with the mRNA and the ribosome22. The mRNA secondary structure element downstream of the slippery site impedes the reverse movement of the 30S ribosomal subunit head domain, which resets the ribosome interactions with the mRNA\u2013tRNA complex in the P site19. While the ribosome makes multiple attempts to complete translocation, tRNAs can realign into the \u22121-frame17,18. Alternatively, frameshifting can occur when the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A site is delayed, e.g., due to the lack of a particular amino acid20,21,23,24. In this case, a tRNA bound to the P site can slip from the 0-frame to the \u22121-frame independently of the mRNA secondary structure elements20,21.",

The frameshifting efficiency (FS) on dnaX is 70\u201380% in vitro and in vivo16,20,25,26. Both codons of the slippery sequence are read by tRNALys. E. coli has a single tRNALys isoacceptor (anticodon 3\u2032UUS5\u2032), for decoding the two Lys codons, AAG and AAA. The modified nucleotide mnm5s2U (S) at the first anticodon position (U34 in the tRNA sequence) is important for the wobble base pairing at the third codon position27. The modified nucleotide base pairs more stably with A than with G (ref. 28), which may favor tRNALys slippage on A4 AAG7 codons8. In E. coli, also nucleotide A37 adjacent to the anticodon of tRNALys is modified. The modified nucleotide, t6A, forms cross-strand stacking interactions with the A in the first codon position and thereby stabilizes weak A\u2013U base-pair interactions in the first codon position27,29.",

We used Bayesian statistics to construct and test such a model using measured FSs for 64 variants of slippery sequences containing Lys (AAA/G) and Phe (UUU/C) codons. The free-energy differences of tRNA base pairing in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame enabled us to reproduce FS for mRNA sequences used in the model and to predict efficiencies for sequences that were not used in the model. The model explains why A1G and A4G mutations of the A1 AAA4 AAG7 motif support surprisingly efficient frameshifting, shows how synonymous codons affect FS, and suggests how tRNA modifications contribute to frameshifting. Furthermore, comparison of the base-pair free-energy differences on the ribosome and in solution allows us to quantify the effect of the ribosome environment on the stability of the codon\u2013anticodon complexes. These results explain the results of previous mutational and biochemical studies16,18,20,26,31 and suggest that the frameshifting efficiency is controlled mainly by the relative thermodynamic stability of the codon\u2013anticodon interactions in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame.",

This indicated that the ribosome is stalled after the incorporation of Lys2 on the AAG7 codon and that frameshifting takes place during the delayed translocation. The incorporation of Val in the \u22121 frame is very efficient compared to the 0-frame Phe and the FS calculated from the ratio of the rate constants of \u22121 frame to 0-frame Val and Phe incorporation, respectively, is consistent with the end-point measurements (Supplementary Fig. 1b).",

This indicated that the point of slippage remains unchanged with the mRNA variants (Supplementary Figs. 2d, e,  3d, Supplementary Table 2).

This indicates that the commitment to the new reading frame occurs before the Val or Phe codon is available for decoding in the A site, that is at the preceding translocation step20. Similarly, for the A1G, A1U and A4G variants the incorporation efficiency is not affected by the presence of Val-tRNA and Phe-tRNA encoding the overlapping (G UUC) codons (Supplementary Figs. 2b, c and 3b). For the A4G construct, if tRNA slippage occurred on the first codon (AAG4) while the second codon was free, the second codon would be decoded in the \u22121-frame (G4AA) by Glu-tRNAGlu, resulting in a MAKE peptide. However, in the presence of Glu-tRNAGlu, the MAKK peptide is still predominant (Supplementary Fig. 3b), indicating that slippage takes place after the decoding of the second codon by tRNALys. In the presence of all aa-tRNAs, we observe only about 5% of the frameshifting peptide containing Glu (MAKEV) (Supplementary Fig. 3d), rendering an alternative frameshift pathway, e.g., stimulated by aa-tRNA depletion, unlikely under given conditions.",

For all codons in the 0-frame of these sequences, base pairs in the first and second positions of the codon\u2013anticodon complex are only Watson\u2013Crick base pairs, whereas in the third position Watson\u2013Crick and wobble base-pairs are tolerated27,32. The FS of the wild-type slippery sequence is about 80%, consistent with the previous reports in vivo and in vitro16,20,25,26. Several slippery-sequence variants also support efficient frameshifting, whereas others diminish frameshifting considerably. Notably, for sequences that have exactly the same codons in the 0-frame and \u22121-frame (A1 AAA4 AAA7 and U1 UUU4 UUU7) the FS is very close to 50% (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the 0-frame and \u22121-frames are equally possible at these conditions, i.e., the ribosome is not inherently committed to maintaining the 0-frame. The FS was high not only with the sequences where \u22121PRF resulted in canonical Watson\u2013Crick base pairs in the \u22121 reading frame, but also in several cases with the expected first position mismatch on one of the slippery codons, such as for C/U/G1\nAAA4AAA7, A1AAG4AAA/G7, A/C/G1\nUUU4 UUU7, A1 AAG4\nUUU7 or U1 UUU4\nAAG7 (the \u22121-frame codon is underlined).

Positive free-energy differences indicate that the free energy of base pairing in the \u22121-frame is larger than in the 0-frame, i.e., that base pairing in the \u22121-frame is less favorable than in the 0-frame. Accordingly, the larger free energy of the \u22121 frame renders frameshifting less likely, and thus FS < 50% is expected. Next, we calculated distributions of FS values (FSmodel) from the obtained distributions of the free-energy differences using the ratio of Boltzmann distributions shown above (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section). Despite the fact that our model only contains 14 free parameters, the calculated efficiencies agree well with the measured efficiencies with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.5% between the mean FSmodel and the FSexperiment (Fig. 2d).",

            "text": "One critical assumption underlying our thermodynamic equilibrium model is that the FS is determined only by the free-energy difference of tRNA binding in \u22121-frame vs. 0-frame. This is only possible if frameshifting is significantly faster than the completion of translocation. In such a case, the kinetic partitioning between frameshifting and translocation would be negligible and the probability of the ribosome to switch into \u22121-frame would be predominantly thermodynamically controlled. This assumption is plausible, because translocation is slowed down considerably by the mRNA stem-loop, but as the elemental rate of tRNA slippage is not known, the extent to which frameshifting is affected by kinetics is unclear. To challenge this assumption, we included a kinetic factor \u03ba into our model such that FSkinetic = FS \u00b7 (1\u2212\u03ba), where FS is obtained from the ratio of Boltzmann distributions (see the \u201cMethods\u201d section; Fig. 3a). For the kinetic factor, we assumed that a free-energy barrier limits the rate of tRNA slippage from the 0-frame to the \u22121-frame and back, i.e. the slippage is slower than translocation. The mean kinetic factor for all mRNA variants was included within our Bayesian approach as a nuisance parameter. Similar as above, the probability of base-pair free-energy differences was obtained for all 64 sequences, now additionally including \u03ba. The resulting rmsd value (2.5%) is similar to that from the model without the kinetic contribution. Further, the most probable mean kinetic factor \u03ba was found to be below 0.1% (Fig. 3b), which indicates that the kinetics of frameshifting does not markedly affect the FS in this experimental system. Independent estimations of frameshiting kinetics suggest that the rate of slippage into \u22121-frame is 10 s\u22121 on the original dnaX slippery sequence and 3 s\u22121 on the A4G sequence (B.-Z. Peng, L. V. Bock, R. Bellardinelli, F. Peske, H. Grubm\u00fcller, and M. V. Rodnina, unpublished data). In comparison, the step that limits the completion of translocation was estimated to 0.1\u20130.5 s\u22121 (refs. 19,20). This supports the notion that, with the frameshifting secondary structure element on the mRNA, completion of translation is sufficiently slow to allow the tRNAs to re-pair with their thermodynamically favored codons.",

The alternative dataset by Sharma et al.36 could not be used, as the values for FS on the native dnaX slippery sequence are inconsistent with those of refs. 20,26, thereby precluding meaningful comparisons. We used 21 FS values from the Tsuchihashi dataset (Supplementary Table 3) to obtain probabilities for free-energy differences, excluding the G7A variant, which was considered unreliable by the authors due to the possibility of transcriptional slippage26, and the 123C variant which encodes a proline and may reflect proline-specific stalling effects37. The 21 mRNA variants not only include seven variants that have been tested in this work, but also sequences that do not preserve the Lys or Phe codon identity, because their P-site and A-site codons encode different amino acids in the 0-frame. As a consequence, a larger set of 26 individual base-pair changes upon \u22121-frameshifting can be considered in the model. Notably, we did not include any information about the experimental FS values obtained in this work (Fig. 1b), so using the Tsuchihashi dataset provides an independent test for the model in vivo. The green histograms in Fig. 2a\u2013c show the probability distributions for the free-energy differences obtained from both datasets, and Fig. 4a\u2013c show the distributions for the remaining base-pair changes. We obtained free-energy differences for six base-pairs in the P site (Figs. 2a and 4a) and for three in the A site (Figs. 2b and 4b), as well as for nine combinations of P-site and A-site base pairs (Figs. 2c and 4c).",

Following this notion, more mismatches introduced in the \u22121 frame imply lower FS. Interestingly, changing the Watson\u2013Crick A\u00b7U base pair to pyrimidine\u00b7pyrimidine (C\u00b7U or U\u00b7U) base pairs comes with the highest energetic penalty, whereas changing the Watson\u2013Crick base pair to a mismatched purine\u00b7pyrimidine base pair (A\u00b7U \u2192 G\u00b7U) or to a mismatched pyrimidine\u00b7purine (U\u00b7A \u2192 C\u00b7A) has a lower penalty. The lowest penalty comes with the change to purine\u00b7purine base pairs (A\u00b7A or G\u00b7A). It is possible that in the codon\u2013anticodon helix two pyrimidines are too far apart, while a pair of larger bases can form contacts, albeit not as well as the Watson\u2013Crick base pairs. For the sequences investigated here, the only base-pair change with a negative \u0394Gbp is G\u00b7S to A\u00b7S in the wobble position of the A-site codon (A3). The nucleotide S is a modified U (mnm5s2U) which interacts more strongly with A than with G; \u0394Gbp = \u22122.9 or \u22124.6 kJ/mol from our in vitro dataset and the Tsuchihashi et al. dataset, respectively (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 4). For the similar modified nucleotide mnm5U, which lacks the s2 modification, the interaction with A is also stronger than with G and the free-energy difference \u0394Gbp is similar, \u22123.8 kJ/mol (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 4; note that the positive values shown therein are for the A \u2192 G change, whereas in Fig. 2b the change is in opposite direction, G \u2192 A). The similar free-energy differences of mnm5s2U and mnm5U suggest that the s2 modification of U does not play a large role in the base-pair free energy. This is different with yeast tRNALys, where mcm5-modified tRNALys lacking the s2 group has a lower affinity of binding to the cognate codon AAA than the fully modified tRNALys38. The difference may be related to the existence of two tRNA isoacceptors in yeast dedicated to reading of AAA or AAG codon each, whereas in E. coli one tRNA isoacceptor reads both codons.",

The first change introduces an unfavorable mismatch in the first position of the first codon, P1 A\u00b7U \u2192 G\u00b7U, which comes with a free-energy penalty of 5.1 kJ/mol (Supplementary Table 4, \u0394Gbp obtained from our dataset). The second base-pair change, the A3 G\u00b7S \u2192 A\u00b7S at the A-site wobble position, however, reduces the free-energy difference by \u22122.9 kJ/mol. Therefore, the total energetic cost \u0394G between the frames is only 2.2 kJ/mol, which, using the ratio of Boltzmann probabilities, results in a FS of 30% that is close to the measured value of 28%. The sequence of A4G (A1 AAG4 AAG7) also introduces one G\u00b7U mismatch (A1 position) upon frameshifting, but has an even higher measured FS of 44%. Our model attributes this higher FS to a favorable G\u00b7S \u2192 A\u00b7S base-pair change in the A3 position (\u22122.9 kJ/mol), which almost neutralizes the unfavorable changes in P3 and A1 (G\u00b7S \u2192 A\u00b7S and A\u00b7U \u2192 G\u00b7U, respectively) of 3.3 kJ/mol to a total free energy cost \u0394G = 0.4 kJ/mol, which results in a FS of 46% in agreement with the measured value of 44%.",

We show that, when translocation is slowed down by an mRNA secondary structure element downstream of the slippery site, the propensity of a tRNA to frameshift on a given slippery codon is largely determined by the free energies of base pairing, and the FS can be confidently predicted based solely on the combinations of base pairs at a given frameshift site. For the presented system, kinetic effects do not contribute to frameshifting, indicating that the stalling time is sufficiently long to allow equilibration via frequent re-crossings of the free-energy barriers between the two reading frames. As a result, only the free-energy difference between the frames governs the FS. The long pause of the ribosome at an mRNA secondary structure element may serve to achieve sufficient equilibration and thereby contribute to enhance the FS. For shorter stalling times, the pause would become too short for the barrier to be overcome sufficiently often, and thus one would predict the FS to decrease with increasing translocation rate. In this non-equilibrium case, the free-energy model that includes the kinetic contribution should provide good estimates for the rates of recoding. It would be interesting to see whether these rates differ for different tRNA species or for modified vs. non-modified tRNAs, which would indicate that certain tRNAs in the cell are more prone to frameshifting.",

The observation that the decoding center is in the same conformation with bound cognate or near-cognate tRNAs suggests that the free-energy difference between the two cases stems from the base-pair interactions27,34,41,42, providing a possible reason for the absence of coupling. In all of the studied mRNA variants, the base pairs in second codon positions remain unchanged upon frameshifting (Fig. 1a). However, if base pairs at the first and second codon positions would be changed at the same time, the helix conformation might change markedly, rendering a coupling between base-pair changes more likely. This effect can be tested by applying the free-energy model to a larger set of FS values for mRNA variants including sequences that lead to position 1 and 2 mismatches. Furthermore, the Watson\u2013Crick-like conformations of U\u00b7G mismatches34,41,42 imply that the free-energy difference of changing a C\u00b7G to U\u00b7G in the first two codon positions is different from that in the third positions, where wobble base pairs are tolerated34. It was suggested that either tautomerization or ionization of the bases allow the U\u00b7G base pairs to adopt the Watson\u2013Crick-like conformation41. Our free-energy model applied to frameshifting efficiencies of mRNA variants which entail the C\u00b7G to U\u00b7G base-pair changes in different codon positions would provide access to the corresponding free-energy differences.",

To prepare initiation complexes, 70S ribosomes (1 \u03bcM) were incubated with a 3\u22125-fold excess of mRNA, a 1.5-fold excess of f[3H]Met-tRNAfMet and a 1.2-fold excess of IF1, IF2, and IF3 each in buffer A for 30 min. Initiation complexes were purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion (1.1 M) in buffer A. Ternary complexes were prepared by incubating EF-Tu (two-fold excess over aa-tRNA) together with GTP (1 mM), phosphoenolpyruvate (3 mM), and pyruvate kinase (0.1 mg/ml) in buffer A for 15 min and then with the purified aa-tRNAs for 1 min. Translation experiments were performed in buffer A at 37 \u00b0C either as end-point experiments (60\u2013120 s incubation) by hand or using a KinTek RQF3 quench-flow apparatus. Translation experiments were carried out by rapidly mixing initiation complexes (0.2 \u03bcM after mixing) with the respective ternary complexes as indicated (1 \u03bcM) and EF-G (2 \u03bcM) with GTP (1 mM). Reactions were quenched by the addition of KOH (0.5 M), and peptides were released by incubation for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. After neutralization with acetic acid, samples were analyzed by HPLC (LiChroSpher100 RP-8 HPLC column, Merck) using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) in order to separate the basic (MAK and MAKK) peptides or in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The elution times of the reaction products were established using a set of model peptides synthesized in vitro, in which one of the amino acids is [14C]-labeled20. The extent of product formation was determined from the ratio of f[3H]Met in the respective peak to the total 3H-radioactivity in the eluate. Quantification of f[3H]MetAlaLys[14C]GluVal was based on the amount of [14C]Glu radioactivity in peptides. FS was calculated from the end points of in vitro translation experiments; the values are mean \u00b1 s.d. (n = 3 or more independent experiments). Time courses were evaluated by numerical integration using MatLab software according to the model shown in Supplementary Fig. 1c. An analogous model was used to evaluate peptide synthesis in the presence and absence of Glu-tRNAGlu. The fraction of non-progressing ribosomes was taken into account by drop-off parameters in the model. Standard deviations of rates were determined by numerical integration using in-built software routines assuming 95% confidence limit. All kinetic experiments were repeated at least twice.",

Setting both \u0394Gbp values to zero at the same time, results in low \u03c3 values for all base-pair combinations (Supplementary Fig. 5d).

Metropolis sampling of P(\u0394Gbp|FSexperiment) was carried out as described above (without kinetic factor), now for the 26 free-energy differences and 21 FS values. In the first step (Supplementary Fig. 8a), the \u0394Gbp of 9 base-pair changes have a low standard deviation \u03c3, showing that their free-energy differences are determined by the Tsuchihashi FS data set (green histograms in Figs. 2a, b, and 3a, b). In steps 2\u20139 (Supplementary Fig. 8b\u2013i), iteratively, the \u0394Gbp of a base-pair change that had a large \u03c3 in all previous steps was set to 0 kJ/mol. Monitoring for which base-pair changes, the \u03c3 values were reduced, we could identify which \u0394Gbp values of pairs of base-pair changes were determined (Figs. 2c and 3c). Finally, in step 10, all the \u0394Gbp values set to 0 kJ/mol in steps 2\u20139 were set to 0 kJ/mol at the same time (Supplementary Fig. 8j). For all steps 1\u201310, the rmsd for the measured FS values and those obtained from the model was found to be between 2.51% and 2.59%. For the Metropolis calculations of step 10 (Supplementary Fig. 8j), the rmsd was calculated as a function of Metropolis steps (Supplementary Fig. 7c) showing the convergence of the Metropolis sampling.",
