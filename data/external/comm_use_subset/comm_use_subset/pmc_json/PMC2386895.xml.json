            "text": "For a wide range of epidemic and epizootic diseases, individuals can be usefully modelled as nodes in a network, where the network links represent potentially infectious contacts between individuals. This network representation applies to many complex systems such as the Internet, the World Wide Web (Albert & Barab\u00e1si 2002), social and transportation networks (Liljeros et al. 2001; Jones & Handcock 2003; Hufnagel et al. 2004) and livestock movement networks (Kiss et al. 2006b; Robinson et al. 2007). Models that use explicit contact structures between individuals, households, cities, regions, countries or farms have been used to analyse the spread of human diseases, such as SARS (Hufnagel et al. 2004; Meyers et al. 2005) and pandemic influenza (Eubank et al. 2004; Ferguson et al. 2005), and animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD; Green et al. 2006a; Kao et al. 2006; Kiss et al. 2006a) and avian influenza (Le Menach et al. 2006). Much attention is now focused on analysing network properties and the dynamic processes they support (for reviews, see Newman (2003b) and Keeling & Eames (2005)), as well as how to effectively control these processes.",

Contact tracing was successful in the 2003 SARS epidemic (Lipsitch et al. 2003), but unsuccessful in the 2001 FMD epidemic in the UK (Ferguson et al. 2001; Keeling et al. 2001; Kao 2003). For simple unstructured populations, contact tracing has been modelled using a combination of branching process analysis complemented by stochastic simulation models (M\u00fcller et al. 2000). However, in more highly structured contact networks, the properties of the network markedly influence the efficacy of contact tracing. For example, contact tracing is more effective on clustered networks than on random networks (Eames & Keeling 2003; Kiss et al. 2005), and on scale-free networks a higher tracing effort is needed to control an epidemic than on random Poisson networks (Kiss et al. 2006b).",

            "text": "In this paper, we examine the impact of departure from the common assumption of proportionate (random) mixing upon the efficacy of contact tracing. Proportionate mixing assumes that the probability of any two nodes being connected is proportional to the product of their number of contacts. This is unlikely in many cases where \u2018like attaches to like, assortatively mixed\u2019 (e.g. STI transmission; Anderson et al. 1990; Catania et al. 1992) or where \u2018opposites attract, disassortatively mixed\u2019 (e.g. livestock trading among farms and markets in the UK (Kiss et al. 2006a); correlation properties of the Internet (Pastor-Satorras et al. 2001)). The empirical evidence and importance of connectivity correlations have led to numerous network- and differential equation-based models (Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 et al. 2003a; Newman 2003a; Barth\u00e9lemy et al. 2005). Many of these models focus on the effect of connectivity correlations on the epidemic threshold, initial growth rate and hierarchical spread. For example, it has been shown that epidemics on networks characterized by high node degree variance grow rapidly, and in the limiting case of infinite variance, instantaneously, independently of the mixing pattern (Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 et al. 2003b). The initial growth of the epidemic changes from exponential to power law if non-random mixing is combined with small-world properties, with the power-law exponent determined by the average node distance on the network (Vazquez 2006). While in the limit of infinite populations, the implications of preferential mixing for disease invasion are well known, here we focus on disease control and consider the efficacy of contact tracing for different mixing patterns. For networks that are poorly characterized, the efficacy of contact tracing is difficult to determine without exact knowledge of the underlying contact network, i.e. who is connected to whom? By analysing disease transmission on theoretical networks with different mixing patterns, we aim to identify the implications of non-random mixing for epidemic dynamics and control strategies.",

In assortatively mixed networks, nodes of high degree preferentially connect to each other and form a highly connected core group. Therefore, for low link density, a larger GC size is found than for either disassortatively mixed or random networks. Link density within the GC is higher than in the network as a whole. In contrast, in disassortatively mixed networks at low link density, the links are more dispersed, forming many isolated components of small size (figure 3). As link density increases, the probability that a link with one node in the GC will only connect to another node already in the GC also increases; this is a finite size effect that is exacerbated by assortative mixing since high-degree nodes are relatively few. Thus, at higher link densities, assortatively mixed networks have a smaller GC size compared with disassortatively mixed networks, as in the latter, added links are more likely to result in smaller components being absorbed into the GC (figure 2).",

This is mainly due to the GC containing a \u2018core\u2019 group of high-degree nodes that are highly connected. The differences in the initial epidemic growth rate across the different network types are directly related to the basic reproduction number R0 (Anderson & May 1991). The value of R0 can be estimated as the lead eigenvalue of the next-generation matrix C=(cij) (Diekmann & Heesterbeek 2000), and, in this case, it can be approximated by the product of the contact matrix and the per-link probability of transmission cij=TpMij. A non-zero entry Mij=1 denotes that an infectious node j can transmit the infection to a susceptible node i; the magnitude of cij is given by the per-link transmission probability Tp. Estimates of R0 averaged over 100 generated networks of each type are as follows: R0=12.12Tp (s.e. 0.11) for disassortatively mixed networks; R0=15.0Tp (s.e. 0.11) for random networks; and R0=17.81Tp (s.e. 0.14) for assortatively mixed networks. As expected, the threshold for epidemic outbreaks occurs at lower infection probabilities for assortatively mixed networks than for either disassortatively mixed or random networks.",

Contact tracing on assortatively mixed networks removes nodes of higher degree (figure 5b) than on disassortatively mixed networks. For small \u03a6 values, the final epidemic size is still high and the population of highly connected nodes is depleted well before the epidemic ends, as shown by the crossover between the average degree of newly infected nodes on the two network types (figure 5b). Over the epidemic, susceptible nodes are on average of lower degree and are more difficult to reach. On disassortatively mixed networks, the depletion of highly connected nodes is less marked and epidemics persist, with disease spread alternating between highly and less well-connected nodes producing an average degree of newly infected nodes which is more even in time (figure 5b). In the latter stages of the epidemic, on disassortatively mixed networks, highly connected nodes are not completely depleted and can become infected. Thus, on the assortatively mixed networks, the epidemic ends earlier with a smaller final epidemic size. On assortatively mixed networks, when global depletion of susceptible nodes is important, contact tracing acts to enhance the early depletion of nodes of high degree (figure 5b).",

            "text": "At higher tracing probability, the proportion of nodes removed through contact tracing (figure 6a) decreases with increasing tracing probability. This is indicative of effective control with a limited proportion of nodes becoming infectious and, hence, fewer targets for tracing. In the regime of more effective control (\u03a6\u22650.61), the epidemics die out early on and susceptible depletion becomes less important. This is illustrated in figure 7, showing that the depletion of susceptibles is only found at low \u03a6 values. This is also reflected in the very rapid reduction of Rg (i.e. average reproduction ratio in generation g defined as the ratio between the number of nodes infected in consecutive generations) below 1 when \u03a6 is high. This is a more general effect corroborated by examining contact-tracing efficacy in a different parameter regime. In figure 6b, the scenario where \u03c4=0.0528 on both networks is considered. For this value of \u03c4 and in the absence of tracing, the final epidemic size is the same on both networks (R(\u221e)\u22480.225). Here, the final epidemic size is similar to the point at which contact tracing starts to perform better on disassortatively mixed networks in figure 6a. In this case, for all \u03a6 values, contact tracing always performs better on disassortatively mixed networks. The behaviour in this regime can be explained by interpreting contact tracing as a mechanism acting to reduce the effective transmission probability Tp past the first generation of infection. Contact tracing achieves this by shortening the average infectious period of traced nodes. In figure 4, lower transmission probabilities correspond to lower values of the transmission rate \u03c4. While we do not have exact analytic relationships between the implications of reducing the transmission probability through the different routes, the effect of contact tracing can be approximated by following the trend of the final epidemic size (figure 4) as the transmission probability decreases. The steeper curve of the final epidemic size on disassortatively mixed networks suggests that a small decrease in the transmission probability has a more marked effect on final epidemic size than on assortatively mixed networks. This effect is especially dominant since in the absence of tracing the same R(\u221e) is observed on both networks. This supports the higher contact-tracing efficacy observed on disassortatively mixed networks.",

For both network types (figure 8), there are considerable differences between the final epidemic sizes for single- and multiple-step contact tracing at high tracing rates, particularly for assortatively mixed networks (figure 8b). In multiple-step tracing, a triggering node can generate other triggering nodes, potentially creating a cascade of triggering nodes throughout the infected portion of the network. This leads to tracing a higher number of infectious nodes and reducing the number of links that successfully transmit the disease. For high tracing rates, the epidemics are short-lived, and, on assortatively mixed networks, as a result of the faster initial epidemic growth rate, the extra proportion of untraced infectious nodes in the case of single-step tracing generates a higher number of infections and hence there is a marked difference between single- and multi-step tracing. In figure 8, the faster decrease in the proportion of traced nodes with increasing tracing probability indicates earlier and more effective control in the case of multiple-step contact tracing compared with the single-step case.",

On assortatively mixed networks, the epidemic spread is faster and the disease typically spreads to nodes with high degree. This is counterbalanced by contact tracing that removes infectious nodes with high degree. On disassortatively mixed networks, the epidemic spread is slower; however, owing to the connectivity pattern, contact tracing also alternates between removing poorly and highly connected nodes and therefore is comparably less effective. The higher average degree of traced nodes is a reflection of the average degree of nodes becoming infected earlier on in the epidemic when highly connected nodes are more abundant.

This may seem somewhat surprising, as previous studies have shown that control strategies such as acquaintance sampling (Cohen et al. 2003) that is based on the local exploration of the population contact structure provide an efficient epidemic control strategy, compared with random removal of nodes. However, such studies considered only networks that are randomly mixed and compare random removal with targeted removal (a form of contact tracing). Here, however, we compare targeted removal but where the networks themselves differ. Like the disease itself, contact tracing exploits the local network structure and, for assortatively mixed networks, identifies and removes early the highly connected nodes. This beneficial effect, however, is counterbalanced by the fast initial disease spread to such highly important nodes. Therefore, in the present case, the properties of the network can at the same time enhance disease spread and also increase control efficacy, highlighting the non-trivial interactions between the network structure and the dynamics on networks, showing that added attention is needed when evaluating the efficacy of epidemic control strategies.",
