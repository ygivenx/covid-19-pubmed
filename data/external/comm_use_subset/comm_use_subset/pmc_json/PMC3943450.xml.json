In phase I and II clinical trials, Mayrink et al.\n[10], demonstrated enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and significant protection (90%) against experimental infection with L. infantum in dogs that had received ultrasound-disrupted, merthiolated promastigotes of L. braziliensis with Bacillus Calmete-Guerin (BCG). Strong cellular proliferation in response to soluble Leishmania antigens has also been reported in dogs vaccinated with autoclaved L. major promastigotes plus BCG as the adjuvant\n[11]. Moreover, in a double-blind randomized efficacy field trial, a single dose of a vaccine composed of alum-precipitated autoclaved L. major vaccine against CVL mixed with BCG was shown to be safe and decreased the incidence of the CVL from 12% to 3.7%, which is equivalent to a 69.3% efficacy rate\n[20].",

Gomes et al.[28] showed that hamsters immunized with DNA plasmid coding LJM19 from Lutzomyia longipalpis were protected against a challenge with L. infantum plus Lu. longipalpis salivary gland sonicate\n[28]. Collin et al.\n[29], working with dogs immunized with saliva recombinant proteins of Lu. longipalpis (LJL143 and LJM17) and challenged with uninfected or infected sandflies, observed a cellular immune response at the site of the bite characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and expression of interferon-\u03b3 or interleukin-12\n[29]. These results suggest that the use of Lu. longipalpis saliva proteins could be a good strategy in developing an anti-CVL vaccine in dogs. In this context, previous studies in dogs conducted by our group used a first generation vaccine composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as an adjuvant and sand fly salivary gland extract (SGE) (LBSapSal vaccine). The immunization elicited increases in the anti-saliva and anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, higher counts of circulating and specific T CD8+, and high NO production after immunization\n[14]. The current study included an analysis of the immunogenicity and a parasitological investigation of dogs immunized with LBSapSal vaccine. The dogs were evaluated for up to 885 days after challenge by intradermal inoculation using L. infantum promastigotes plus Lu. longipalpis SGE.",

In the presence of VSA (Figure \n3C), a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the stimulated cell/non-stimulated cell ratio of CD8+ T cells was observed in the LBSapSal dogs compared with the LBSal group at 90 dac. When we evaluated the SLiA stimulus (Figure \n3D), a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the ratio of CD8+ T cells was observed in the LBSapSal dogs at 90 and 435 dac compared with 885 dac. In addition, the LBSapSal group showed a higher (p < 0.05) ratio of CD8+ T lymphocytes compared with the C dogs at 435 dac. In contrast, the LBSapSal group displayed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the CD8+ T-cell ratio compared with the Sal dogs at 885 dac.",

Our results revealed an increase in the number of circulating CD5+ T lymphocytes in dogs vaccinated with LBSal and LBSapSal. This increase was associated with high levels of CD4+ T- and CD8+ T-lymphocyte subpopulations. Interestingly, the LBSapSal vaccine induced a persistent increase in CD8+ T lymphocytes throughout the period after challenge. In immunophenotypic CVL studies, increases in CD5+ T lymphocytes and subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were reported and related to a profile associated with possible resistance against infection by L. infantum[3,49-51]. In a Brazilian endemic area, vaccination of dogs using Leishmune\u00ae was associated with increased frequency of CD8+ T lymphocytes and an absence of clinical signs 18 months after immunization\n[8]. The increase in CD8+ T circulating lymphocytes in dogs vaccinated against CVL is considered to be an important biomarker of resistance against infection by Leishmania[13,14]. Thus, the expansion of CD5+ T lymphocytes and the sustained increase of CD4+ and CD8+ T subsets observed in LBSapSal vaccinated dogs seem to reflect the attempt of the immune system to eradicate the parasite after intradermal experimental challenge. This large antigenic repertoire in the composition of LBSapSal vaccine probably induces responsive memory T lymphocytes, which expand in the peripheral blood inducing a transient increase in CD5 and CD4 lymphocytes, due to exposure to parasite in an attempt of the dogs' immune system to control a possible increase or spread of the L. infantum parasite to the organs.",

This stimulation observed in PBMC of Sal-vaccinated dogs indicates a nonspecific stimulation and the use of SGE in the experimental challenge could stimulate the immune cells and occasional oscillations occuring in these animals. Moreover, when we stimulated PBMCs with SLiA, an increase in the stimulation index was observed in the LBSapSal group at 90 and 435 dac compared to the C dogs.

In addition, Reis et al.[3] described high numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes from the spleens of asymptomatic dogs in the presence of Leishmania antigen compared with symptomatic dogs, indicating the importance of these cells to control the L. infantum infection in dogs. In this sense, both in humans and dogs, asymptomatic infection has been linked to higher Leishmania-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes\n[52,53].

The experimental challenge using an intravenous route with high numbers of parasites (107\u2013108 promastigotes) seems to be the most efficient challenge model\n[37]. However, this type of challenge can hide the real experimental vaccine efficacy by suppressing a protective response that could be present in vaccinated dogs\n[35,54-56]. Thus, an experimental model of infection that most closely resembles Leishmania natural transmission is increasingly recommended and desired by many investigators; however, the use of infected sandflies is not easy and remains an obstacle in the dog model. In this work, we used SGE associated with the experimental challenge in an attempt to mimic a sand fly feeding on blood and inoculating an animal with saliva and Leishmania promastigotes. However, our results showed that all dogs remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up (885 dac), indicating that the use of SGE was not sufficient to replicate the bite environment and enhance experimental infection\n[21-25].",

Further, the real-time PCR technique, used by several authors in order to diagnose and screen the evolution of VL in quantifying the parasite burden, offers high sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility\n[36,57,58]. In our work, we applied the real-time PCR technique to quantify the number of amastigotes per milligram of spleen. Interestingly, we found that the LBSal group (60%) and LBSapSal dogs (69%) had a higher proportion of parasite reduction when compared with the control animals. This reduction in parasite load may be associated with the immune response induced by salivary components presenting in both vaccines. Some studies show that Lu. longipalpis salivary proteins induce an immune response associated with protection in dogs\n[14,29]. Furthermore, in a hamster model, salivary protein of a sand fly vector protects against the fatal outcome of visceral leishmaniasis\n[28]. Thus, the protection obtained in the present study confirms the capacity of this prototype vaccine (LBSapSal) to limit parasite replication even long after challenge (885 days).",
