By Jan 7, 2020, it was confirmed that a new type of coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (formerly named as 2019-nCoV) had emerged 2. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the Wuhan pneumonia as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) on Feb 11, 2020 3. The COVID-19 patients showed typical respiratory symptom (such as cough, fever, and lung damage) and some other symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, and diarrhea 4, 5. As of February 17, 2020, a total of 73,332 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia has been reported in China and 25 other countries, of which 72,528 cases was found in China 6. Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 through human-to-human transmission, the cases currently continue to rise. SARS-CoV-2 extracted from patients with pneumonia in Wuhan is an enveloped single stranded RNA-type beta-coronavirus 7. The genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 shared 79.5% sequence identity to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) 8, 9. In addition, the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enters human alveolar epithelial cells through binding angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 8.",

According to the current clinical guideline in China and the experiences in the treatment of SARS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients, both conventional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are used for the treatment of patients with infection of SARS-CoV-2 in China 12-14. This review mainly focuses on the discussion of TCM usage in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, in the context of current conventional management. Due to the homology in epidemiology, genomics, and pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV 8, 9, and widely usage of TCM in the treatment of patients infected with SARS-CoV in 2002-2003 15, the clinical evidence showing the efficacy and safety of TCM in the treatment of patients with the emerging coronaviral will be summarized and analyzed, including the laboratory studies that provide an insight into molecular basis of therapeutic benefits.",

HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir have been used, typically in combination with appropriate antibiotics or with IFN\u03b1-2b, in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients 7, 17. Nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin 12 may be potentially beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19, since ribavirin was approved for treating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection 18 and used extensively during the SARS and MERS outbreak 10. However, ribavirin had severe side effects such as anemia 18 and whether it had sufficient antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Nucleoside analogs favipiravir (T-705) can effectively inhibit the activity of RNA polymerase of RNA viruses such as influenza 19. A recent in vitro study found that it had the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity 20, but the in vivo effect remains elusive. Remdesivir may be the most promising antiviral drug for treating COVID-19. It has in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity against a wide array of RNA viruses including SARS and MERS 21, and could decrease viral loads and pathology of lungs in animal models 22. A study showed remdesivir markedly inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells 20, and most symptoms of the first US patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 had resolved swiftly after intravenous administration with remdesivir 23. Currently, it is under clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous remdesivir for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 24. Oral oseltamivir has been used for the treatment of the cases with SARS-CoV-2 7, while its efficacy currently remains uncertain.",

Ranging from case reports, case series, controlled observational studies and randomized clinical trials, clinical studies aiming to examine the effect of TCM on SARS have been carried out and reported. There are quite compelling evidences support the notion that TCM has beneficial effect in the treatment or prevention of SARS. For example, the rate of fatality in Hong Kong and Singapore was approximately 18%, while the rate for Beijing was initially more than 52% until the 5th of May and decreased gradually to 4%-1% after the 20th of May in 2003. The dramatic reduced fatality from late May in Beijing was believed to be associated with the use of TCM as a supplement to the conventional therapy 44. Lau and colleagues reported that, during SARS outbreak, 1063 volunteers including 926 hospital workers and 37 laboratory technicians working in high-risk virus laboratories used a TCM herbal extract, namely Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San. Compared with the 0.4% of infection in the control group, none of TCM users infected. Furthermore, there was some evidence that Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San could modulate T cells in a manner to enhance host defense capacity 45, 46. In a controlled clinical study, the supplementary treatment with TCM resulted in marked improvement of symptoms and shortened the disease course 47. The clinical beneficial effect of TCM appears to be supported by laboratory studies. For example, a high-profile research published in the Lancet reported that glycyrrhizin, a major active constituent liquorice root which is the most frequently used Chinese herb, potently inhibited the replication of clinical isolates of SARS virus 48. Another independent study confirmed the antivirus activity of glycyrrhizin by plaque reduction assays and this study found that another Chinese herbal compound baicalin also had the anti-SARS activity 49. Furthermore, Wang et al. found MOL376, a compound derived from TCM, may become a lead compound for SARS therapy by inhibition of cathepsin L, a target for the treatment of SARS 50.",

However, the evidence is not sufficient enough due to the poor quality of methodology used in the trials 13. Leung analyzed 90 peer-reviewed papers with reasonable quality from 130 publications and concluded that TCM used together with conventional treatment had some positive effects, including better control of fever, quicker clearance of chest infection and other symptoms. However, such beneficial effect of TCM is not conclusive and more high-quality clinical studies are required 15. In another thorough literature analysis, Liu and colleagues concluded that there was no benefit of adjuvant treatment with TCM in terms of mortality 39. Due to the lack of high quality TCM trials and biases that influenced the validity of results, Wu and colleagues suggested to re-run clinical trials of TCM for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) 51.",

Yu et al. reported scutellarein and myricetin potently inhibited the nsP13 (SARS-CoV helicase protein) in vitro by affecting the ATPase activity 61. The RNA- dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a key enzyme responsible for both positive and negative-strand RNA synthesis, also represents another potential druggable target. It was shown that the extracts of Kang Du Bu Fei Tang (IC50:471.3 \u00b5g/mL), Sinomenium acutum (IC50:198.6 \u00b5g/mL), Coriolus versicolor (IC50:108.4 \u00b5g/mL) and Ganoderma lucidum (IC50:41.9 \u00b5g/mL) inhibited SARS-CoV RdRp in a dose- dependent manner 54. Wu et al. performed large- scale screening of existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds (>10000 compounds) to identify effective anti-SARS-CoV agents through a cell-based assay with SARS virus and Vero E6 cells 62. They found that ginsenoside-Rb1 isolated from Panax ginseng, aescin isolated from the horse chestnut tree, reserpine contained in the genus Rauwolfia and extracts of eucalyptus and Lonicera japonica inhibited SARS-CoV replication at non-toxic concentrations 62.",

This TCM herbal product not only blocked the early stages of influenza virus infection but also inhibited virus-induced gene expression of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, IP-10, and MCP-1 82. Additionally, a study by Dong et al. reported that the levels of IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-23 in the sputum and of IL-8 and IL-17 in the blood were markedly decreased after Lian Hua Qing Wen Capsule treatment in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 83.

Nevertheless, some scientists have started to examine the effect of TCM products or its components on SARS-CoV-2 in their laboratories. For example, an in vitro study showed that Shuang Huang Lian Oral Liquid had the inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 78. However, its clinical efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has not been evaluated. We noticed that this TCM product was not recommended by HNC's Guideline 89. Same as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses receptor ACE2 for the cellular entrance 8. Theoretically, blockade of ACE2 can prevent the infection of SARS-CoV-2. Chen and Du thus performed the molecular docking study and they found that TCM-derived compounds, including as baicalin, scutellarin, hesperetin, glycyrrhizin and nicotianamine could interact with ACE2 107. Therefore, these compounds as well as herbs containing these ingredients may have the capacity to inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We anticipate more experiment studies showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of TCM or its components will be published in the near future.",

Providing complementary and alternative treatments are still urgently needed for the management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, experiences in TCM is certainly worth learning. Fighting against current epidemics also provide an opportunity to test the true value of TCM in treating emerging contagious diseases. Randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies is the best way to provide the most reliable evidence for a therapy, including TCM. It is encouraging that the controlled clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of TCM in the treatment of SARS-CoV were conducted and reported. However, the most of these studies were found to be poorly designed and the results could lead to potential biases in evaluating the effectiveness of TCM treatment 13. Hopefully, current clinical study to evaluate the effect of TCM on COVID-19 will use more strict protocols, concealment of allocation, and double-blinding, in order to ensure the compliance of international acceptable standards. Furthermore, standardized products of TCM, rather than self-prepared formulations, should be used in clinical study. Experiment study may be able to elucidate the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of TCM in the treatment of COVID-19. The further study of TCM may lead to the identification of novel anti human coronavirus compounds that may eventually prove to be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 or other emerging fatal viral diseases as conventional therapeutic agents.",
