            "text": "Influenza virus infections are considered a significant public health problem given that they cause seasonal epidemics and recurring pandemics [1]. There were more than 29,000 cases of infections, and 3,000 human deaths attributed to the 2009 global H1N1 influenza pandemic [2]. Because of the high mutation rates of the viral genome, vaccines and drugs initially directed against the virus often become ineffective [3,4]. Therefore, measures are urgently needed to prevent and treat influenza virus infections, especially for high-risk groups and in the event of another pandemic. Certain host cell factors involved in the viral infection cycle have attracted interest as therapeutic targets because these are crucial for viral infections. Targeting these factors might inhibit infection, and there is the added advantage that they are less prone to mutations [5-7].",

            "text": "Sialic acid (SA) molecules, found at the non-reducing terminal position of glycoproteins or glycolipids on the surface of cells, are binding targets for influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HAs) [8]. The HAs of human IAVs preferentially bind to \u03b1-2,6 linked SA, which is abundantly expressed in the human respiratory tract. The HA proteins of avian IAVs prefer \u03b1-2,3 linked SA as a receptor, as it is predominant in the avian enteric tract [9]. The binding of HA to its appropriate receptor is crucial for the initiation of infection and therefore serves as a potential therapeutic target. The novel sialidase fusion protein, DAS181 (Fludase), enzymatically removes SAs from the respiratory epithelium and exhibits potent antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses [10]. Sialyltransferases are key enzymes that regulate the biosynthesis of sialylated oligosaccharide sequences [11]. Weinstein et al. concluded that one enzyme, \u03b2galactoside \u03b12,6sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal I), encoded by ST6GAL1, was responsible for the addition of \u03b1-2,6 SAs to the Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc disaccharide found on the glycans of N-linked and some O-linked glycoproteins [12]. Lin et al. found that antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides targeting ST6GAL1 mRNAs could inhibit the enzymatic activity of ST6Gal I, and reduced 2,6-sialylation at the cell surface [13,14].",

Qe et al. used siRNAs specific for conserved regions of the influenza virus genome; these proved to be potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo[19,20]. However, siRNAs solely targeting the genes of influenza viruses are unlikely to be sufficient in eliminating infection because there is a high possibility of generating resistant mutants. Therefore siRNAs targeting host cellular determinants crucial for viral entry and/or replication could be a more efficacious antiviral therapy.",

Influenza viruses naturally infect epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract and the lungs of humans. Thus, siRNAs can be administered by inhalation.

            "text": "In other studies, investigators found that human influenza viruses can still infect ST6GAL1 knock-out mice, achieving similar titers in the lung and trachea as compared with wild-type animals [25]. A possible explanation for this is that there was greater efficiency of infection as a result of a deficient systemic influenza-specific humoral response in these ST6GAL1 knock-out mice [26]. There are two major types of SA\u03b12,3Gal, which differ in their penultimate bond (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc or Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) and these are synthesized by different enzymes [27-29]. Some human influenza virus strains propagated in allantoic cavities are able to bind to both SA\u03b12,6Gal and SA\u03b12,3Gal [9,25,30]. When recombinant rat \u03b12,3-sialyltransferase was used to reconstitute sialic acids, only one type of galactose was linked to other glycans through \u03b2-1,3 but not \u03b2-1,4 linkages [31-33]; however, it is possible that other strains maintain the ability to bind to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc. Thus, SA\u03b12,3Gal (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) present in these mice can compensate for the loss of SA\u03b12,6Gal [34]. Monteerarat et al.[35] reported that suppression of SA\u03b12,3Gal expression by siRNAs against another sialyltransferase, \u03b2-galactoside \u03b1-2,3-sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) could inhibit H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. The findings from our current study support the conclusions of Monteerarat et al., and we have further extended these to airway epithelial targets of human IAV infection. A combination of these two types of siRNAs might result in broader spectrum synergistic activities, depending upon their targets.",
