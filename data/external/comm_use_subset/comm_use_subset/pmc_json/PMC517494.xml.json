            "text": "The susceptibility to virus infection varies greatly among different cell types, and virus-resistant cells frequently emerge post-infection [1-4]. This suggests that host cell contributions to the virus life cycle, although complex, have genetic determinants. We therefore used a genetic approach to identify cellular genes required for infection by reovirus, a small cytolytic RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm. A gene trap retrovirus was use to create libraries of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cell clones in which each clone contained a single gene disrupted by an integrated retrovirus. The mutant libraries were then infected with reovirus, and resistant clones were selected. We hypothesized that genes mutated by gene entrapment may confer reovirus resistance as a result of either haploinsufficiency or loss of heterozygosity and could be identified by characterizing the genes disrupted by the entrapment vector. From these experiments we have isolated 152 clones and have characterized mutations in 111 different genes, providing potential candidates required for reovirus infection and/or cell killing. Many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. For example, four mutations affected genes in the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) pathway, including genes encoding the IGF-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor [5,6] (Igf2r, locus ID 25151), the IGF binding protein 5 protease [7] (Prss11, locus ID 65164, 2 clones), and CTCF (Ctcf, locus ID 83726), a transcriptional repressor of the IGF-II gene (Igf2) involved in paternal imprinting.",

Clone 6B72, which contains a mutation in Ctcf [8], was found to over express Igf2 transcripts, consistent with the known role of CTCF as a transcriptional repressor of the Igf2 gene. Moreover, forced expression of IGF-II in RIE-1 cells was sufficient to confer cellular resistance to lytic reovirus infection. Enforced IGF-II expression also transformed RIE-1 cells to anchorage independent growth, a phenotype associated with malignant change. These results represent the first use of gene entrapment to identify components of host cell metabolism required for virus infection and illustrate a potential mechanism of carcinogenesis associated with chronic virus infection.",

Unfortunately, cells persistently infected with reovirus (PI) can emerge at high frequencies (one in 102\u2013103) and are intrinsically resistant to the virus [9,10]. In preliminary studies, we found that hepa 1/a cells were not suitable for genetic studies due to the emergence of PI clones. However, persistently infected rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1) [11,12] were found to require a serum survival factor and die when placed in serum free media (Figure 1). In vitro infection of RIE-1 cells with reovirus also appears to mirror virus replication in the rodent host [13-15]. Consequently, RIE-1 cells were used in the present study, and reovirus-resistant clones were selected in serum-free medium to remove PI survivors. RIE-1 cells were mutagenized by using the U3NeoSV1 gene trap shuttle vector [16] (see Methods) and the resulting libraries of mutagenized cells were infected with reovirus serotype 1/Lang at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 35, to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. The isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, and did not produce infectious virus as assessed by plaque assay, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not PI.",

Altogether, of the 151 isolated clones, 62% of flanking sequences matched known or presumptive genes, and an additional 23% were represented in the public databases of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) or non-redundant sequences (nr). From the 111 clones matching known or presumptive genes, 10 genes were represented more than once. Many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. For example, the library included 4 independent mutations involving three genes that encoded proteins associated with the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) signalling pathway, namely, IGF-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor [5,6] (Igf2r, locus ID 25151), the IGF binding protein 5 protease [7] (Prss11, locus ID 65164, 2 clones), and CTCF (Ctcf, locus ID 83726), a transcriptional repressor of IGF-II involved in paternal imprinting [17,18]. The position of the provirus (clone 6B72) in the first intron of the Ctcf gene is shown in Figure 2. CTCF differentially represses maternal Igf2 gene expression, whereas the imprinted paternal gene escapes repression due to methylation of CTCF binding sites [17,18].",

Diminished CTCF expression was associated with an increase in Igf2 transcripts as assessed by Northern blot hybridization (Figure 3B). In addition, two products were amplified from 6B72 cells by RT-PCR using primers flanking the IGF-II pro-hormone coding sequence (Figure 3C). The first product was identical to the rat IGF-II pro-hormone (pro-IGF-II) coding sequence (Accession X17012), whereas, the second contained 14 additional nucleotides generated by splicing of exon 2 to an alternative splice acceptor located 14 nucleotides upstream of the normal Igf2 exon 3 splice acceptor site. The alternative transcript is expected to encode a pro-IGF-II protein extending 11 amino acids into the E-peptide sequence ending in a stretch of 60 amino acids lacking homology with any known protein (Figure 4).",

Expression of the Igf2 gene in an anti-sense orientation caused no significant difference in the capacity of 6B72 cells to resist infection (data not shown). These studies suggest that increased Igf2 expression in 6B72 cells is associated with their capacity to resist reovirus infection, and that the Igf2svencodes a trans-dominant isoform that blocks the activity of Igf2.",

Other proteolytic products including the 89-residue carboxy-terminal E peptide may also be biologically active [20]. The Igf2sv PCR product also contained a single nucleotide substitution (G1393A) that results in the substitution of a threonine for alanine at position 62 of IGF-II, raising questions about Igf2 sequences that influence reovirus resistance. Vectors expressing only the 68-residue IGF-II protein both with and without the A62T change were compared for their ability to confer resistance to lytic infection by reovirus type 1 (Figure 6). The IGF-II expression vector converted RIE-1 cells to a virus resistant phenotype; whereas, the IGF-II62T expression plasmid was inactive (Figure 6) and did not suppress the resistance of 6B72 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that virus resistance can be affected by mutations in the IGF-II coding sequence and downstream sequences, including the E-peptide, are not required. However, the trans-dominant effects of Igf2sv apparently require alterations to the carboxy-terminus of the IGF-II pro-hormone.",

Georgi and colleagues showed that directly fluorescentated reovirus particles dissipated their fluorescent signal coincident with disassembly of the outer capsid [25]. To determine whether over expression of igf2 would affect disassembly of virions, we examined the fate of virus during the first hours of infection. Purified reovirus type 1 virions were directly labeled with fluorescein and adsorbed to RIE-1 or 6B72 cells, and the persistence of a fluorescein signal determined at 2 hrs following virus absorption (fig 8A,8B). The binding of virions to RIE-1 cells and 6B72 cells and initial accumulation of virus particles within cells was similar, however fluorescence was almost non-detectable in RIE-1 cells (Figure 8A) whereas it was still present in 6B72 cells at 2 hrs (Figure 8B). In addition, western blot analysis of virion proteins 2 hrs following attachment to cells confirmed the persistence of the \u03c33 protein in the 6B72 cell clone, but not RIE-1 cells (fig 8C,8D). Therefore, disassembly of virions is altered in the 6B72 cell clone.",

As IGF-II targets the igf2r to lysosomal degradation, mutations in the genes encoding either the receptor (Igf2r) or its ligand (Igf2) will affect the activity of the other, and result in a reduced endosomal trafficking of hydrolases necessary for reovirus disassembly [24].

Igf2 also transformed RIE-1 cells to anchorage-independence, a phenotype that predicts the potential for malignant growth in vivo. Virus-resistant 6B72 cells also grew in soft agar, presumably as a result of enhanced IGF-II expression. Since plasmids expressing only IGF-II were less active in transforming RIE-1 cells to anchorage independence than vectors expressing the entire pro-hormone, further study is needed to determine whether the capacity of RIE-1 cells to proliferate in soft agar is enhanced by the E-peptide or other products derived from the carboxy terminus of the pro-hormone. In other studies, the E-peptide enhanced insulin secretion from \u03b2-cells [20], and may play a role in cellular transformation [31].",

Virus resistance was a genetically selected trait manifested by clonally pure cell populations, could be conferred by enforced IGF-II expression, and involved decreases in virus disassembly. Although decreased virus disassembly is sufficient to explain virus resistance, we do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms may contribute to the resistance of 6B72 cells, since any genetic selection may generate clones with multiple, independent mutations. The fact that an early step in infection (uptake/disassembly) is defective in 6B72 cells makes it very difficult to test whether downstream steps might also be affected.",

However, based upon our observations, such therapy may carry a risk associated with selection of virus resistant cell clones with enhanced growth/survival potential. Additionally, chronic infections contribute to the development of a number of human cancers [46-49]. While the carcinogenic process is not well understood, cell proliferation associated with inflammation is also thought to contribute to tumour promotion [50,51].
