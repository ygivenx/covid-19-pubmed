The current academic system in the Netherlands, like in many other places around the world (Powell, 2015), is not designed to have scientists staying in a postdoc position forever. So, you are either deemed good enough to become a permanent staff member, or you have to leave academia at some point and try your luck in a pharmaceutical company or elsewhere. I had not succeeded in the former, but I also did not want to do the latter, so I took a less threaded path and headed to China.",

Before arriving at the Institute of Microbiology (IMCAS), I had been exchanging emails with Christopher Vavricka, an American postdoc who was working in the same lab since 2009 (Vavricka, 2011). Although the information provided by him helped me to shape my expectations, the culture shock was still considerable. Fortunately, my Chinese colleagues were also very helpful and after a few weeks, I could already conduct my first experiments on one of the internal proteins of an influenza-like virus discovered recently in bats (Tefsen et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014). During my period at the IMCAS, I witnessed the hard work and dedication of the students and staff in the lab. I also got a real taste of Chinese culture, as many events in Chinese life are accompanied by very delicious food.",
