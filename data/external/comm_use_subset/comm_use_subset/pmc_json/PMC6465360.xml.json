NiV was discovered in 1999 during an outbreak of encephalitis in Malaysia and was identified and isolated after methods for Japanese Encephalitis prevention were ineffective.1 This inaugural NiV outbreak caused at least 265 cases of encephalitis and 105 deaths, and necessitated the culling of over 1 million pigs, which were found to be important for transmission to humans.1,2 Although no further outbreaks in Malaysia have occurred, there have been 3 outbreaks in India and nearly annual outbreaks in Bangladesh since 2001, typically resulting from bat-to-human transmission via consumption of contaminated raw date palm sap.3 An outbreak in May 2018 in the state of Kerala in India had a case fatality rate of 86%, solidifying NiV as a persistent and grave threat in South Asia.4",

A live-attenuated recombinant measles virus (MV) expressing NiV G for human use (rMV-Ed-G) completely protected hamsters upon lethal NiV challenge. In a follow-up study, two African green monkeys (AGMs) immunized with 2 doses of rMV-Ed-G and subsequently challenged had no clinical signs before euthanasia.10 MV-based vaccine vectors can confer long-lasting immunity.11 Furthermore, preexisting immunity to MV in the human population does not seem to confound successful vaccination attempts.12,13 A VLP-based vaccine approach has also been tested for efficacy in a Syrian golden hamster challenge model. VLPs are antigenically similar to parental virus and are generally more immunogenic than subunit vaccines and can stimulate both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system.14 While both single and triple doses of VLPs expressing NiV G were able to fully protect hamsters from challenge, adjuvant was required to boost immunity and achieve high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Moreover, incomplete lethality in the model allowed for survival in control groups not receiving vaccination, thereby complicating the vaccine-specific effect on survival.15 Further testing in pre-clinical models is warranted. A single administration of live-attenuated replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking its native glycoprotein but expressing both Ebola GP and NiV G (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVG) was shown to prevent virus shedding, replication, and Nipah disease in AGMs.16,17 While live VSV-based vaccine vectors may have utility in emergency situations or for ring vaccination, regulatory approval for use in humans has been slow due to concerns regarding potential pathogenesis.18,19 Widespread adverse events and questionable efficacy in human populations of rVSV-EBOV may represent existing gaps in VSV-vectored vaccine approaches.20\u201322 However, replication-defective single-cycle recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV\u0394G) pseudotyped with either NiV F or G showed protection against 1000 times LD50 NiV challenge in Syrian golden hamsters after a single dose inoculation, offering a distinct safety advantage over the live-attenuated rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVG.18 Nonetheless, production requires multiple plasmid transfections which can be costly for large-scale manufacturing.",

NiV is neurotropic, since its envelope protein binds to receptors predominantly expressed on neuronal cells, and Nipah disease has been known to cause encephalitis and neurological symptoms in infected humans.1,3 Therefore, live NIPARAB inoculation could potentially lead to pathogenicity by restoring neurovirulence, even though BNSP333 is nonvirulent after peripheral administration in adult mice.23 To study this potential impact, three groups of ten C56BL/6 mice (split equally by gender) were infected i.n. with 5.75 log10 focus-forming units (ffu) of either live BNSP333 (negative control), NIPARAB, or SPBN (positive control). Animals were monitored for weight loss and clinical signs of disease for 40 days to observe both immediate and latent adverse effects. Endpoint criteria for euthanasia were weight loss exceeding 20% of the original body weight or hallmark neurological symptoms, such as ataxia. SPBN is derived from the same rabies virus vaccine strain as BNSP333, but it lacks the attenuating mutation in RABV G, making it lethal when administered i.n. to adult mice.23 All mice receiving SPBN succumbed to infection by day 10 post-exposure, whereas all mice inoculated with BNSP333 remained healthy with no weight loss or malaise. Similarly, all mice infected with live NIPARAB survived the duration of the study with no apparent pathogenicity, as indicated by steady weight gain and the absence of neurological disease (Fig. 3a, b). These data demonstrate that addition of NiV G to BNSP333 does not reestablish pathogenicity in the parental vector within an immune competent mouse model and may be safe for use as a wildlife vaccine.",

(Fig. 6, gray bars). HeV-specific sera effectively neutralized NiV, hence demonstrating that HeV (G-specific) antibodies not only bind to NiV G but also possess antiviral effector function. No neutralization was observed in sera from negative control mice immunized with INAC BNSP333, which is expected since these mice did not have any NiV G-specific antibody titers in ELISA (Fig. 6, Group 1). However, sera from all mice immunized with INAC NIPARAB developed nAbs, although titers were variable between individual animals (Fig. 6, Group 3). Similarly, mice vaccinated with live NIPARAB generated NiV G-specific nAbs, except for 2 male animals for which no nAb titers were detected (Fig. 6, Group 2). On account of these two animals, there were significant differences in nAb titers between live NIPARAB-immunized males and corresponding females (*p < 0.05), as well as when compared with both males and females immunized with INAC NIPARAB (*p < 0.05). Overall, animals in the INAC NIPARAB cohort had significantly higher titers of nAbs than animals in the corresponding live vaccine group (***p < 0.001). These results suggest that neutralization may be an important component of vaccine-induced protection by NIPARAB and that 2 doses of the killed vaccine are more immunogenic than inoculation with live vaccine regarding generation of NiV-specific nAbs. However, a challenge study in animals vaccinated with NIPARAB needs to be conducted to determine if nAbs correlate with survival.",

NiVB caused 100% mortality in infected AGMs while NiVM caused only 50% mortality. Furthermore, histopathology in NiVB-infected AGMs showed more severe lung and spleen phenotypes and a shorter therapeutic window for human monoclonal antibody treatment than NiVM-infected counterparts.44 Since there is a 95% amino acid sequence homology between the glycoproteins of these two strains,19 an effective vaccine against the more highly pathogenic NiVB strain would likely protect against exposure to NiVM. In fact, this has been demonstrated experimentally: ferrets vaccinated with a live attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine expressing NiV G from the Bangladesh strain were 100% protected against heterologous challenge with a Malaysian isolate of NiV.45 Studies have also successfully utilized the F protein of NiV to develop protective vaccines against both strains and HeV,15,19 but we decided to target the glycoprotein to block virion-receptor binding, an entry step that occurs before membrane fusion.",

Since our candidate vaccine for humans is chemically killed, viral replication is completely abrogated, rendering our vaccine potentially safer than NiV vaccines that use a live vector (e.g., live-attenuated rVSV-ZEBOV-GP-NiVMG), especially in susceptible populations like immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, or children. A live virus vaccine might be better intended for use in wildlife. Indeed, the rabies strain upon which our recombinant NIPARAB is based (SAD B19) has been successfully used as a live oral vaccine for wildlife in Europe.50 Our data have shown that live NIPARAB does not cause pathogenicity in mice, even when administered at a high dose (5.75log10 ffu) intranasally, and has the added benefit of bivalency toward rabies, a devastating pathogen that widely affects both humans and wildlife in the same geographic regions where NiV outbreaks occur. Moreover, INAC NIPARAB is immunogenic after a single dose of unadjuvanted vaccine (Fig. 4b), and titers remain elevated even one month after secondary unadjuvanted immunization. By contrast, soluble NiV and HeV glycoprotein subunit and VLP-based vaccines require one or more doses of adjuvant to be immunogenic.15,19 Furthermore, INAC NIPARAB does not have to contend with the issue of pre-existing vector immunity in human cohorts like measles-vectored NiV vaccines.12 Previous studies have shown additive immunity with subsequent vaccinations of rabies-vectored inactivated vaccines.7,37,38,51",
