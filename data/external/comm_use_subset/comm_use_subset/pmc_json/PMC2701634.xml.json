The primary sequence (Val254 to Ala288) in the vicinity of these two \u03b1 helices has been found to share homology with several other nucleic acid polymerases and has been termed the \u201chelix clamp\u201d [5], [8]. Extensive studies have been carried out to shed light on the relationship between the \u201chelix clamp\u201d and function of RT. The effects of alanine-scanning mutations in \u03b1-H and \u03b1-I on polymerase activity, primer/template (P/T) binding, fidelity and enzyme kinetics have been determined. While mutations in \u03b1-I do not affect P/T binding or fidelity significantly, several \u03b1-H mutants exhibit lower binding affinity, processivity and frameshift fidelity [9]\u2013[12]. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutations in these two helices can have significant effect on RNase H activity, minus-strand DNA transfer activity and removal of polypurine track primer [13], [14].",

In our previous study on hepatitis B virus RT, conserved residues located at the \u201cturn\u201d of helix clamp motif were found important for pregenomic RNA encapsidation during the assembly of nucleocapsids [15], [16]. Since this homologous helix clamp motif is also present in HIV-1 RT, we hypothesized that residues in the turn may play important roles in viral life cycle. Our recent study showed that alanine substitutions at 271 and 274 of HIV-1 RT drastically affected viral replication, but discordance between viral replication and RT activity was observed [17]. In this study, we confirmed our previous observations and further investigated why the two mutations abrogated viral replication. Our study demonstrated that these two mutations lead to rapid degradation of RT in viral particles, indicating that the residues of 271 and 274 are critical for maintaining the stability of HIV RT.",

The results showed that, except for RT (Fig. 2B), all products of the Gag-Pol polyprotein, IN p32, PR p11 and CA p24, were detected in the mutants Y271A and I274A at a level similar to that of the wild type pseudoviral particles (Fig. 4A). Thus, Pr160gag-pol was indeed incorporated into the virions and processed properly. To study if the RTs in the viral particles of Y271A and I274A mutants were degraded by proteolysis that made them undetectable, pseudoviruses of wild type and mutants were generated in the presence or absence of indinavir, a highly specific inhibitor of HIV-1 protease. Indinavir treatment was effective, because the treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Pr55Gag processing into p24 for wild type and mutant viruses (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, in the absence of indinavir, both RT p66 and p51 were readily detected in the wild type pseudovirus, but not in the mutant viruses. In the presence of indinavir, however, both RT p66 and p55 were markedly reduced in the wild type virus but became detectable in mutant Y271A viral particles, while RT p66 was also detectable in mutant I274A virus. We also detected the RT subunits in the viral supernatants collected at earlier time points (12, 24 and 36 hours post-transfection), but the mutant RTs were still undetectable (data not shown). These results suggested that the Y271A and I274A RTs were degraded after incorporation of Gag-Pol polyprotein into the virions, which might be attributed to the activity of viral protease.",

The results showed that the RT mutants were still undetectable in the presence of EFV (Fig. 5A). The conformation of the wild type and mutant RT p66 was further analyzed by native gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). Under native conditions, wild type p66 subunit formed homodimer. However, the formation of homodimer in mutant Y271A was markedly reduced and a higher order oligomer appeared, which might be tetramer according to its molecular weight, while mutant I274A existed as at least two higher order oligomers, which were likely tetramer and octamer based on their molecular weights. However, the exact nature of the oligomers formed by mutant p66 subunits remained to be clarified. Furthermore, the treatment with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol could partially disrupt the higher order oligomers and improve dimer formation.

This finding suggested that these amino acids might probably play important role in maintaining the active conformation of RT. Consistently, structural analysis suggested that amino acids at these two sites are buried in the thumb region of RT (Fig. 6A). It was further revealed that all wild type RTs have relatively big side chains, but they are absent from the mutants 271A and 274A (Fig. 6B & 6C).

However, the turn between helices H and I of HIV-1 RT thumb region (amino acid residues 269 to 277) has not been well characterized yet. To understand the structure-function relationship of this turn in details, we investigated whether alanine substitutions in this region would affect RT activity. Except for residues 269 and 270, which have been reported to have no significant influence on RT activity [9], [10], and for residue 272, which is originally an alanine, six mutant pseudoviruses (residues 271 and 273 to 277) were constructed and viral replication was compared with that of the wild type virus. The replication of two mutants, Y271A and I271A, were found to be almost completely abolished (Fig. 1A). This result was further confirmed in live virus system (Fig. 1B & 1C). Since it has been reported that bacterially expressed Y271A mutant has only 1% activity of wild type enzyme [9], we asked whether the mutants would similarly affect RT activity in the viral particles. The results showed that the RT activity was basically undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants (Fig. 2A). It was also found that the loss of RT activity in the viral particles might be attributed to the absence of RT in the viral particles rather than the incorporation of dysfunctional RT into the virions (Fig. 2B).

Our results showed that Pr160gag-pol was properly expressed and transported in cells transfected with mutant constructs, Y271A and I271A (Fig. 3), indicating that these mutations did not affect either the production of the precursor or the interaction between Pr160gag-pol and Pr55gag. It was further found that the Pr160gag-pol was indeed incorporated into the virions of these two mutants, because except for RT, all other products of Pr160gag-pol including p24, protease and integrase [31], [32], could be detected in the viral particles of mutants Y271A and I271A (Fig. 4A). Although it has been reported that the domain between residues 183 and 305 of RT is likely responsible for RT incorporation [33], our study ruled out the involvement of the turn (Gln269-Arg277). Another report has suggested that two mutations in RT, L234D and W239A, led to premature cleavage of the Gag-Pol precursor and reduced levels of viral enzymes in the virions [34]. Our results also excluded that the mutations of Y271A and I271A affected the cleavage of the Gag-Pol precursor. By a viral protease inhibition assay using indinavir, we finally demonstrated that the RT mutants were degraded after incorporation of the precursor polyprotein into the virions and the degradation was associated with the activity of viral protease (Fig. 4C). Our results indicated that the mutations in residues 271 and 274 would reduce the stability of RT inside the viral particles, rendering it susceptible to viral protease.",

            "text": "Post-incorporation degradation of RT has been reported previously. Wapling et al. [35] have reported that mutations of W401L and W401A in RT can inhibit RT dimerization, resulting in reduced steady-state level of the RT subunits p66 and p51 in viral lysate, while Gag-Pol was not affected. They also showed that HIV-1 protease contributed to the degradation of RT subunits in the virions. A similar result was also observed when mutations were introduced into the protease cleavage site between RT p51 and RNase H domain [36]. Another mutation, L289K in p66 subunit, has also been reported to be able to abrogate dimerization [37]. Another group, when they tried to generate infectious molecular clones of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, found that glutamic acid replacement at position 287 affected the stability of RT [38]. The biologically active and stable form of HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of p66 and p51, while the immediate precursor of p66/p51 heterodimer is the p66 homodimer. Proteolytic removal of the RNase H domain in one of the p66 homodimer subunit by HIV-1 protease leads to the formation of stable heterodimer p66/p51 [39]. RT exists as an equilibrium mixture of monomers and dimers that include the p66/p51 heterodimer and the p66/p66 and p51/p51 homodimers, among which the heterodimer is the most stable and the p51/p51 homodimer is the most unstable [40]\u2013[43]. Plausibly, the degradation of RT as reported in previous studies may be ascribed to the inhibition of RT p66 dimerization by the mutations.",

Our results showed that RT mutants were still undetectable in the viruses generated in the presence of a potent dimerization enhancer (Fig. 5A). Our native gel analysis showed that the dimer form of RT mutant 271A was detected, although it was markedly reduced as compared to the wild type, while mutant 274A could not form dimer. Instead, higher order oligomers of RT were detected in both mutants (Fig. 5B). It has been reported that higher order oligomerization may occur in HIV-1 RT [41], [44], [45]. Our results have also indicated that Y271A and I274A substitutions may change the conformation of RT, leading to oligomerization. The higher order oligomers formed in these 2 mutants, perhaps tetramer and octamer, may be associated with instability of RT mutants and their susceptibility to viral protease. Furthermore, according to the locations of residues 271 and 274 (Fig. 6A), it is highly probable that alanine substitutions at 271 and/or 274 can affect the conformation of p51 thumb region and subsequently its interaction with RNase H domain of p66, resulting in the exposure of the 7-amino-acid p51-RNas H cleavage sequence in the p66 subunit [7], [46] and consequent proteolytic degradation by HIV-1 protease. The relative conservation of RT 271 and 274 residues and the loss of big side chains at these two sites in the mutants as shown in the structural models (Fig. 6B & 6C) also support their important roles. We tried to demonstrate this in vitro, by treating wild type and mutant RTs with recombinant protease, but wild type RT, as well as mutant RTs, could not be digested in vitro (data not shown). This result is consistent with that reported by Abram and Praniak [36]. This could be explained by different proteolytic stability of RT in vitro and in virions.",

Mutations in residues 271 and 274 of RT may inactivate the virus, which may enter cells but can not replicate. These findings may prove useful in anti-HIV drug design and vaccine development. Considering the emergence of resistance to the current RT inhibitors, this turn, especially amino acid residues 271 and 274, may be an ideal new target for antiviral drug design. The agents targeting this region may be able to affect the stability or dimerization of HIV-1 RT and subsequently inhibit viral replication.
