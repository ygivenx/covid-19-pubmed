            "text": "Individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 harbor complex viral populations within their bloodstreams. Recently, it has come to light that when these people infect others, the new infection is typically established by only one or a small number of virions from within this complex viral swarm [1]. This appears to be true for transmission mediated by all modes, including sexual transmission, mother-to-child transmission, and intravenous infection via needle sharing [1\u20139]. The virus populations in newly infected individuals often start off as genetically homogenous and match a strong consensus sequence during the first days and weeks after transmission [3,9]. Only over time does viral diversity begin to bloom. The critical question is whether the virions that seed and establish new infections possess unique biological properties or whether transmission is simply so inefficient that it produces an extreme (but random) genetic bottleneck. Indeed, recent studies show that virions isolated from early in infection do have some unique biological properties, and this is still an active area of research [3,5,10\u201315]. If it continues to be substantiated that early isolates have unique properties, prophylactic vaccines will only need to overcome this special subset of HIV-1, curtailing the significant problem that global viral diversity presents to vaccine design. This simplification of the problem has fueled new hope for the long-elusive HIV-1 vaccine.",

            "text": "Primates have played a critical role in the history of HIV-1 [16]. HIV-1 originated from the zoonotic transmission of a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to humans [17], and HIV-1 disease and transmission is now modeled in primates in the lab [18]. The natural reservoir of SIV in African primates is ancient, with over 40 primate species being endemically infected with unique SIVs [17,19]. It has been proposed that the long-term coevolutionary history between primates and SIVs may have affected the evolutionary trajectory of the CD4 gene [20,21], which encodes the main cell surface receptor for both HIV and SIV. The CD4 gene has experienced numerous rounds of natural selection in favor of new allelic versions, specifically favoring sequence change at the virus-binding surface of the molecule [20,21]. The most rapidly evolving residues in CD4 fall at the interaction interface with the HIV-1 surface protein Envelope (Env) (Fig 1A). One model to explain this evolutionary signature is that primate individuals harboring CD4 alleles resistant to SIV infection have a selectable advantage compared to their peers. While SIV can probably mutate to bypass most receptor blocks, there will not be significant pressure to do so until a substantial number of hosts harbor CD4 alleles resistant to SIV infection. In this way, evolutionary arms races can unfold even though hosts and viruses have starkly different evolutionary rates (for a review on this topic, see [27]). Indeed, we and others have observed that many host receptors have evolved under intense selective pressure to modify virus\u2013host interaction interfaces [16, 22\u201326]. Despite speculation regarding the significance of the unusual evolutionary signatures in CD4 [20,21], a comprehensive functional comparison of CD4 from different primate species has not been conducted since an appreciation has been gained for the special properties of early HIV-1 isolates.",

We are particularly interested in primary HIV-1 isolates derived from the blood of newly infected people, in light of the new appreciation for the special properties that relate to transmission [29]. One primate genus (macaques; both rhesus and pig-tailed species) has previously been evaluated for the ability of its CD4 receptor to support entry of early HIV-1 isolates. Unfortunately, the macaque CD4 receptor does not support entry of the vast majority of early HIV-1 isolates, frustrating attempts to model transmission and early HIV-1 infection in these animals [30\u201332]. On the other hand, we found that most allelic forms of owl monkey CD4 do support entry of early HIV-1 isolates [33]. Beyond these species, the compatibility of early HIV-1 isolates with primate CD4 receptors has not been explored. We reasoned that HIV-1 compatibility with primate CD4 receptors might be dynamic, given that CD4 is highly diverged in its protein sequence at the interaction interface with HIV-1 Env (Fig 1A).",

Using retroviral transduction, we stably introduced these genes into Cf2Th cells (dog thymocytes) that had also been engineered to express the human C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) coreceptor for HIV-1 entry (S1 Fig). Expression levels of these CD4 receptors on Cf2Th cells were similar to endogenous expression levels of CD4 seen on human immortalized T cells and on primate primary T cells that we isolated directly from blood (S1 Fig). Our goal was then to infect these cells with an early HIV-1 isolate. For the sake of this study, we refer to all viruses or Env clones that were isolated <150 days post infection as \u201cearly\u201d and those isolated >150 days post infection as \u201cchronic\u201d isolates. This nomenclature is consistent with the Fiebig scale classification, for which Fiebig stages I\u2013V (typically lasting until 70 to 150 days post infection) capture early infection stages and Fiebig stage VI indicates progression into chronic infection [34,35]. This is also consistent with other studies on transmitted or early HIV-1, which have used viruses isolated from human blood weeks to months after infection [5,9,31,36,37].

            "text": "The HIV-1 Envelope clone \u201cBG505\u201d has risen to prominence in the study of early HIV-1. The Overbaugh group amplified BG505 Env from an infant approximately 6 weeks after delivery and showed that this Env sequence was nearly identical to the two other Env sequences amplified from this baby at the same time point [9]. This indicated that the infection probably started from a single virion and that the captured Env sequence closely resembles the Env of this transmitted virion. A cocrystal of BG505 Env has been solved in complex with CD4 (Fig 1A) [28,38\u201340], and the alternate folding conformations of BG505 Env have been characterized in depth [41]. We prepared HIV-1 pseudotyped with the BG505 Env by cotransfecting 293T cells with two plasmids: one expressing the BG505 Env, and another expressing an HIV-1 green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter virus genome (Q23\u0394Env-GFP, representing a blood-derived clade A isolate from 1 year after seroconversion [30,42]). Cell lines expressing human CCR5 and different primate CD4 receptors were then infected with this BG505 virus (similar infection results were obtained in cell lines expressing matched CD4 and CCR5 from each species; S2 Fig). Forty-eight hours post infection, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Samples were first gated for live cells and further gated such that all samples were narrowed to the same log decade of CD4 receptor expression (S1 Fig). GFP-positive (i.e., infected) cells were then enumerated within this population. We identified three categories of CD4 receptors that support HIV-1 entry to varying degrees (Fig 1B). The CD4 receptors of some species (shown with purple bars: white-cheeked gibbon, olive baboon, gelada, black snub-nosed monkey, colobus, and owl monkey) behave similarly to human CD4 when challenged with BG505 HIV-1. These species are not our closest relatives but rather are distributed throughout the primate phylogeny (Fig 1B). A second class of species (shown with gray bars: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and sooty mangabey) encodes CD4 receptors that support entry of this virus but at a level that is approximately 2-fold lower than human CD4. A third class of species (macaques, mandrills, sabaeus monkeys, and squirrel monkeys) encodes CD4 receptors that support entry at a level 25-fold or more reduced compared to human CD4. With some of the CD4 receptors in the latter class, infection was reduced by more than 100-fold compared to human CD4. While the chimpanzee CD4 allele tested here has a semi-permissive phenotype, we have recently shown that some chimpanzee CD4 alleles are highly resistant to HIV-1 entry [48]. As a control, we determined that infection did not change the surface expression level of human or any primate CD4 receptor (S1 Fig). This allows us to conclude that the observed differences in infection are due to defects in entry and that our gating strategy did not exclude infected cells because they no longer express CD4. From this data, we can conclude that CD4 receptors are functionally variable from one primate species to the next with regards to supporting entry of an early HIV-1 isolate. Prior to this, there was only one primate species known to encode a CD4 receptor compatible with early HIV-1 isolates, owl monkeys [33], but now we can add five additional species to that list: white-cheeked gibbon, olive baboon, gelada, black snub-nosed monkey, and colobus monkey.",

            "text": "HIV-1 entry requires engagement of the amino-terminal \u201cD1\u201d domain of the CD4 receptor (residues 1\u201398). This is evidenced by numerous Env\u2013CD4 cocrystals [43\u201345] and mapping of D1-domain residues that affect interaction with HIV-1 Env [43,46\u201348]. For instance, the macaque CD4 receptor can be rendered functional for HIV-1 entry by introducing a single amino acid substitution in the D1 domain (isoleucine \u201c39I\u201d mutated to the human residue, asparagine \u201c39N\u201d) [31]. Likewise, owl monkey populations circulate CD4 alleles that are both non-functional (39I) and functional (39N) for HIV-1 entry [33]. From the panel of primate CD4s that we have tested, we can now build on this observation that residue 39 in CD4 is particularly important for HIV-1 engagement. In Fig 1B, the residues encoded at CD4 position 39 in each species are listed at the tips of the phylogeny, along with the total number of amino acid differences in the D1 domain compared to human CD4. From this, it appears that CD4 must encode an asparagine (\u201cN\u201d) at position 39 in order to have any appreciable function as a receptor for BG505 HIV-1. Indeed, position 39 in CD4 has experienced positive selection during primate speciation [20,21], and this may be because mutations that replace the asparagine protect individuals against infection. However, there are clearly sequence determinants outside of position 39 that also matter because not all receptors with an asparagine at position 39 function equally well.",

From this point forward, we focused on CD4 receptors from a subset of primate species, in particular the African primate species involved in the zoonotic transmissions of HIV-1 (chimpanzees and gorillas) and HIV-2 (sooty mangabeys) [17], and the macaque species that serve as the current laboratory model for HIV-1 (expression histograms for these cell lines are shown in S2 Fig). All of these receptors were partially or highly defective for entry mediated by BG505 Env (Fig 1B). We next tested Envs isolated from the blood of four individuals chronically infected with HIV-1 at time points more than 6 months after the original infection [49]. These Envs were pseudotyped onto Q23\u0394Env-GFP, as described above. These viruses were then used to infect stable cell lines expressing human CCR5 and CD4 from different primate species. Two of the four Envs demonstrated the specific use of human CD4 that we have described (Fig 2A, left two panels). The other two demonstrated a weakening of this selective CD4 phenotype but still a preference for human CD4 (Fig 2A, right two panels). This suggests that the phenotype of selective CD4 usage may be retained during later stages of disease and may not be unique to early HIV-1 isolates.",

To test this, we made use of sets of molecular clones that had been amplified by single-genome amplification from patient blood early after infection and then again from the same patient 6 months later [3,14,50,51]. From four such sets of molecular clones, we cloned the rev-env cassettes into a mammalian expression vector, which was then used to pseudotype each Env onto Q23\u0394Env-GFP, as described above. These viruses were tested for their ability to enter cell lines stably expressing human or primate CD4 receptors, along with human CCR5. We observed no significant difference in receptor usage between the early Env (grey bars) and its matched 6-month counterpart (black bars) (Fig 2B). In fact, for each patient, the Envs derived from the two different time points (6 months apart) behaved almost identically. Infection mediated by all of these Envs was reduced in cells expressing chimpanzee or macaque CD4 receptors when compared to human CD4. One exception was seen with virus from patient CH40, whose Env did mediate entry somewhat better via chimpanzee and macaque CD4 compared to other Envs, although still less well than with human CD4. Therefore, selective use of primate CD4 receptors appears to describe many HIV-1 isolates from the blood, including those isolated just after infection (weeks), later at 6 months (Fig 2B), or even during chronic stages of infection (Fig 2A).",

HIV-1 was pseudotyped with Envs from mother\u2013infant pairs, of which the mother was chronically infected and her baby was newly infected (<6 weeks) [9]. For seven such pairs, we found that mother HIV-1 Envs (black bars) were not different from infant HIV-1 Envs (grey bars), in that all demonstrated the selective use of human CD4 (Fig 2C). In fact, corresponding mother and baby Envs behaved very similarly. When the seven pairs were grouped, no significant differences were noted between maternal (chronic) and infant (early) Envs in terms of their ability to infect cells bearing chimpanzee or rhesus macaque CD4 receptors (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P > 0.05). The tested pairs represented most major HIV-1 group M subtypes, suggesting that selective use of CD4 may describe all or most globally circulating forms of HIV-1. We next verified this by challenging cell lines expressing different CD4 receptors with early HIV-1 isolates representing each of the four major group M (pandemic) HIV-1 subtypes. These four Envs, isolated from patient blood shortly after initial infection [36,52,53], were pseudotyped onto the Q23\u0394Env-GFP virus, as described before. While human CD4 supported entry of all of these viruses, primate CD4 orthologs supported levels of HIV-1 entry that ranged from 2- to 58-fold lower (Fig 3A). Collectively, our study has explored a breadth of HIV-1 isolates taken from patient blood, representing all of the major subtypes found globally, and has found that they can all be phenotypically described by their selective use of only certain primate CD4 receptors.",

Thus far, all of the Envs that we have tested are from CCR5-tropic viruses isolated from the blood. There are three types of HIV-1 in the body of an infected person: CCR5 T cell-tropic (the most abundant form in the blood, utilizing the CCR5 coreceptor), CXCR4 T cell-tropic (in the blood but using an alternate coreceptor, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 [CXCR4]), and CCR5 macrophage-tropic (rare in the blood, usually found in the central nervous system) [29,54\u201356]. Only the first of these transmits to new individuals, whereas the latter two types arise in special evolutionary niches within the human body during the course of chronic infection and rarely transmit [57\u201363]. In this study, we did not consider or test CXCR4-utilizing viruses. We next tested HIV-1 pseudotyped with Envs from four macrophage-tropic viruses [31,64\u201372] for their ability to infect cells bearing primate CD4 receptors (Fig 3B). In stark contrast to the blood-derived isolates tested above (Figs 1, 2 and 3A), macrophage-tropic viruses were promiscuous in their use of all CD4 receptors tested. For each primate CD4 tested, the median relative infection for all early HIV-1 Envs (Fig 3A) was significantly lower than macrophage-tropic Envs (Fig 3B; P < 0.05; Mann\u2013Whitney U test).",

            "text": "Macrophage-tropic HIV-1 Env is known to bind CD4 with higher affinity compared to other forms of HIV-1 Env [73\u201375]. This is a selected property that these virions possess because macrophages have lower densities of CD4 molecules on their surface [74]. Based on this, we hypothesized that weak CD4 binding affinity is what makes most blood-derived HIV-1 Envs sensitive to small sequence differences in CD4 receptors from different primates. To test this, we first purified a soluble version of the human CD4 receptor for use in neutralization assays (sCD4, consisting of the D1 and D2 domains of CD4) (S3 Fig). When sCD4 is preincubated with HIV-1, it is known to competitively inhibit virus interaction with the CD4 expressed on the cell surface and block virus entry [76]. Our purified human sCD4 behaved identically to a commercially available version (S3 Fig). HIV-1 pseudotyped with early or macrophage-tropic Envs was preincubated with increasing concentrations of sCD4 and then used to infect TZM-bl indicator cells (HeLa CD4/CCR5 cells that express luciferase in response to HIV-1 tat expression). HIV-1 pseudotyped with either of two different early Envs (BG505 or AC10.0.29) was neutralized in a dose-dependent manner by human sCD4 (Fig 3C). As expected, HIV-1 pseudotyped with either of two macrophage-tropic Envs (BaL or SF162) was neutralized by human sCD4 to an even greater extent, consistent with these viruses having a higher affinity for CD4 (Fig 3D). The IC50 values are shown within each panel and are approximately 4-fold higher for early Envs than for macrophage-tropic Envs. In conclusion, the broadened ability to enter cells through the CD4 receptors encoded by all primates tested (Fig 3A and 3B) correlates with tighter CD4 binding (Fig 3C and 3D).",

            "text": "To further test this premise, we next created a panel of Envs engineered to have high, medium, or low binding affinity for CD4. BG505 Env, the prototypic early Env discussed above, was engineered to have two different point mutations, one at position 281 and the other at position 375. These mutations in Env have been previously shown to increase binding affinity to CD4, although only one of them has been characterized within the BG505 Env background [77,78]. Consistent with these previous reports, the A281V mutation subtly increased binding to human sCD4 relative to wild type (demonstrated by increased neutralization by sCD4), while the S375Y mutation resulted in a more substantial increase (Fig 4A). While both of these mutations were originally characterized because they increase entry via macaque CD4 [77,78], we found that both mutations also improve entry via all of the primate CD4 receptors tested, with increasing improvement as the binding affinity for CD4 increases (left to right in Fig 4B). This pattern of increased binding affinity for human CD4 and increased ability to enter cells via primate CD4s also correlated to increased binding affinity for primate CD4 receptors, as read in a neutralization assay with purified chimpanzee and rhesus macaque sCD4 proteins (left to right in Fig 4C). Finally, we engineered two additional mutations into HIV-1 BG505 Env that have been shown to increase CD4 binding and to increase entry via macaque CD4 [77]. These mutations also make Env able to more efficiently mediate entry via all primate CD4s tested, not just that of macaques (Fig 4D). These data support the general premise that promiscuous use of primate CD4s can be created by mutations in Env that increase CD4 binding affinity. Further, the promiscuous use of primate CD4 receptors is not just a property of macrophage-tropic viruses but instead may be a common property of viruses engineered or adapted to bind CD4 more tightly. The fact that virtually no blood-derived HIV-1 isolate that we have tested has this phenotype (promiscuous use of primate CD4 receptors) suggests that this phenotype is strongly selected against in the human body. The reasons for this are unknown.",

Cells expressing HIV-1 Env on their surface were mixed with cells expressing human CCR5 and various primate CD4 receptors (Fig 5A). Cellular fusion was assessed using a split luciferase reporter system in which, upon cell\u2013cell fusion, the two halves of luciferase merge and produce a functional enzyme [79]. We used this assay to test the interactions between four different Envs and six different CD4 receptors, as shown in Fig 5B. In this system, the phenotypes seen in our previous infection assays were largely recapitulated despite the fact that this assay is virus-free and only requires three proteins (Env and CD4/CCR5). The early Envs mediated fusion most efficiently with cells expressing human CD4, while the macrophage-tropic Envs broadly engaged and fused with diverse primate CD4 receptors. This assay, when taken together with the experiments employing purified CD4 described above, reveal that weak binding to CD4 is what makes most blood-derived HIV-1 isolates (i.e., those fueling the global pandemic) selective in their use of only certain primate CD4 receptors.",

Since macaques (predominantly rhesus macaques) serve as the current animal model for HIV-1, we sought to determine whether some allelic variants of rhesus macaque CD4 might encode receptors that better support HIV-1 infection. We sequenced the CD4 gene from 52 captive Indian-origin rhesus macaques and identified alleles encoding five unique CD4 protein variants (Fig 6A). All of these allelic versions of rhesus macaque CD4 behaved identically and were nonfunctional for entry of virus pseudotyped with BG505 Env and also with Env from another early HIV-1 isolate, CAP210.2.00.E8 (Fig 6B). Therefore, while owl monkey and chimpanzee populations circulate CD4 alleles with dramatically different functions as receptors for HIV/SIV entry [33,48,80], it appears that the function of macaque CD4 is identical from one allele to the next.",

These Envs were universally poor at mediating fusion with cells expressing rhesus macaque CD4 and CCR5 proteins (Fig 6C). Similar data have been generated in other large screens of early HIV-1 Envs [31,32]. Collectively, it seems that virtually no HIV-1 isolated from the bloodstream is compatible with the macaque version of CD4.

This finding is highly analogous to what has been observed with primate restriction factors that block HIV-1 infection, in that they too are highly species-specific in their interaction with HIV-1 [84,85]. Like CD4, most restriction factors are also evolving under intense positive selection in primates [86\u201389], explaining why these proteins vary in protein sequence on virus-binding surfaces from one host species to the next. It appears that SIVs, and probably other viruses as well, have put intense selective pressure on these genes to evolve in a way that changes the protein sequence on virus-binding surfaces. The selection and retention of new CD4 alleles that block virus entry could protect a species from infection, at least until the virus population counter adapts. When this type of arms race is playing out in multiple host species independently, it drives divergence in protein sequence at host\u2013virus binding interfaces and has the long-term effect of making it difficult for viruses to move between species [16]. Indeed, a prevailing theme that has emerged in recent years is that receptor sequence divergence serves as a potent barrier to the movement of viruses between species [16,90\u201394]. Likewise, this study suggests that HIV-1 entry is blocked by the CD4 receptor of some primate species that it might encounter, whether that be in the wild or in the lab. On the other hand, we identify several primate species that encode CD4 receptors compatible with unmodified isolates of HIV-1 from the human bloodstream, including early isolates. These species could possibly be useful as animal models of HIV-1 transmission and infection, assuming that restriction factor blocks can be overcome in these species.",

This weak affinity makes HIV-1 Env sensitive to sequence differences in the CD4 molecule. The strongest evidence in favor of this model is that viruses that have been selected or engineered to have tight CD4 binding affinity become agnostic to sequence differences in primate CD4 and can more efficiently enter cells using all CD4 orthologs that we have tested. While neutralization assays to assess the CD4 binding affinity of a given virus are laborious, our assay for selective or promiscuous primate receptor usage allowed us to screen a large number of HIV-1 isolates from human blood. Based on this, we show that weak CD4 binding is a nearly constant property of HIV-1 circulating in the human bloodstream, including but not specific to early-stage virions. This underscores the need to further understand the significance of CD4 binding affinity to HIV biology. While it has long been known that different HIV types have different affinities for CD4, the functional consequences of this are unclear. This is important to understand because weak CD4 binding seems to be selected for in the human bloodstream, yet some of our current primate models use Envs that are engineered for tight CD4 binding affinity so that they more efficiently engage the nonpermissive macaque CD4 receptor. For example, mutations at HIV-1 Env 375, when engineered into SHIVs, render virons compatible with macaque CD4 [77]. However, mutations at this position do not emerge in vivo when HIV-1 Envs are adapting to macaque CD4, whereas mutations at Env 281 do [78]. Based on our data, we can now speculate that Envs with high binding affinity to CD4 have a fitness penalty in vivo.",

            "text": "Given that nearly all HIV-1 in the human bloodstream seems to be selected to bind CD4 weakly, why would this be preferable? Although the reasons for this are currently unclear, there have been numerous speculations put forward [29]. It is possible that more efficient use of CD4 requires changes in Env conformation that would increase susceptibility to antibody neutralization. Indeed, Arrildt and colleagues have shown that when compared to patient matched T-cell tropic isolates from the blood, macrophage-tropic isolates appear to be more sensitive to certain CD4 binding site antibodies [95]. Thus, any conformational change that increases antibody neutralization sensitivity would likely be purged from the viral population. Alternatively, tighter CD4 binding is known to enhance HIV-1 tropism for cells of the monocyte\u2013macrophage lineage [73,95,96]. However, replication of HIV-1 in these cells appears to be slowed due to cell type\u2013specific blocks, including the restriction factors SAMHD1 and APOBEC3A [97,98], delayed reverse transcription and integration [99,100], and transcriptional repression [101]. These blocks to replication in macrophages may put high-affinity CD4 binders at an evolutionary disadvantage during early stages of infection. Finally, highly efficient macrophage infection may directly promote disease via inflammatory processes. HIV-1 infection of central nervous system macrophages coincides with severe inflammation and neuronal impairment [102\u2013105]. Additionally, respiratory and cardiac dysfunction during late-stage HIV-1 infection has been associated with chronic inflammation, of which macrophages may be playing a central role [106,107]. Viral infection is a delicate balance between replicating efficiently enough to transmit, yet limiting disease to maintain the health of the host. Altering cellular tropism via high-affinity CD4 binding may be disadvantageous to the virus, disproportionately skewing infection toward a more diseased state.",

            "text": "Fig 6: (A) Total RNA was isolated from the blood of 52 rhesus macaque individuals. CD4 was amplified from cDNA, and PCR products were sequenced to yield genotype information for each individual (104 chromosomes). Genotype information was used to phase SNPs using Phase 2.1 [81,82] in DNAsp v5 [83]. The table summarizes the unique CD4 alleles identified. For each allele, the residue encoded at each variable amino acid positions is noted. Unique alleles were cloned and further verified by Sanger sequencing. (B) Dog thymocytes (Cf2Th cells) stably expressing human CCR5 and the indicated rhesus macaque CD4 alleles (x-axis) were infected with HIV-1 (Q23\u0394Env-GFP) bearing a subtype A (BG505) or subtype C (CAP210.2.00.E8) Envelope (Env). The percent cells infected (GFP-positive) was measured by flow cytometry 48 hours post infection. Error bars represent the mean + SEM from two independent experiments, each with three technical replicates. Values above error bars represent fold decrease relative to human CD4 for those samples that passed significance thresholds (one-way ANOVA for repeated measures effect, Dunnett\u2019s test; P < 0.05). (C) 293T cells transiently expressing diverse HIV-1 Envs (see S1 Table) and Cf2Th cells stably expressing the indicated CD4/CCR5 receptors were each transfected with plasmids encoding half of a split Renilla luciferase [79]. These two cell types were then cocultured to induce membrane fusion, which was detected by a luminescent product following the addition of the renilla luciferase substrate. A total of 33 Envs were tested from the following major HIV-1 subtypes: subtype A (n = 12), subtype B (n = 7), subtype C (n = 6), subtype D (n = 6), and subtype A/D (n = 2). The percentage of fusion was calculated relative to what was observed with human CD4/CCR5. Error bars represent the mean + SD, for which n = 2 (two technical replicates from one experiment). Data associated with this figure can be found in the supplemental data file (S6 Data). nt, nucleotide; aa, amino acid; CCR5, C-C motif chemokine receptor 5; GFP, green fluorescent protein.",
