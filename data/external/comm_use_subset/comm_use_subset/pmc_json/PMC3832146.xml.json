            "text": "Licorice, derived from the dried roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza species (Leguminosae family), is one of the oldest and most commonly used Chinese traditional medicines (TCM) in China (1). Clinical and experimental studies show a variety of pharmacological activities of Glycyrrhiza uralensis including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiviral, antiulceric, antispasmodic, antiallergic, antidiabetic, anticancer, hepatoprotective, expectorant and memory enhancing activities, etc (2-6). In addition to its sweet taste, licorice is also widely utilized as flavoring additives in soft drinks, candies and other foods. Therefore, here is a great demand for it in food industry. There are about 30 species containing in Glycyrrhiza genus all over the world. According to Chinese Pharmacopoeia, only three species including Glycyrrhiza uralensis, G. glabra, and G. in\ufb02ata are officially used as licorice. Traditionally, this medicinal plant was collected from wild growing populations. However, over-collection of wild licorice induced a rapid decrease in wild resources and led to desertification of the habitat. Selecting and breeding becomes a key issue to expanding the medical resource of licorice. However, the low germination rate and content of active components in cultivated licorice limit its large-scale cultivation (7-8). High radiation, microgravity and other space factors may change the hereditary in plants and create a new breed (9-10).",

In the recent years, several recoverable satellites have been launched and the researches about the effects of spaceflight mainly focused on the diversities of growth, development, physiological and genetic characteristics of the plants. Heretofore, the study on comparison and identification of multiple components between the spaceflight plant and the ground control sample via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been hardly reported. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the spaceflight can influence the pharmacological activity of the medicinal plant. The aim of the present study was to utilize the HPLC method to identify the main components in licorice and compare the differences pre and post spaceflight and the anti-inflammatory activity was compared between the samples. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time to report that series of changes were studied focusing on the main components and pharmacological activity of licorice pre and post spaceflight. The research will provide the scientific data for a new breeding of medicinal plant by spaceflight.",

Comparing the contents of liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid between the groups of spaceflight and ground control, it increased obviously in the root samples from the licorice seed orbited in an extraterrestrial environment. Especially the content of glycyrrhizic acid in the group of H was two times higher than that of the ground control with significant differences. As for the unknown components, comparison of the fingerprints, there were some differences between the group A and ACK, however, they were not found in H and HCK.

Xylene-induced ear edema is a well-accepted and popular model for evaluating anti-in\ufb02ammatory activity.

At 0.5, 1, 2, and 6 h after i.g. administration, pre-treament with licorice root extracts (0.5, 1, and 2 g/Kg) inhibited oedema in a dose-dependent fashion and dexamethasone significantly (p < 0.01) inhibited the increase in paw thickness induced by carrageenan. Vascular permeability induced by acetic acid was measured by Evan\u2019s blue dye from the abdominal cavity. As shown in Table 4, licorice extractions inhibited the acetic acid-induced extravasation of Evan\u2019s blue dye in mice approximately from 9.62% to 37.19% respectively as compared to a control (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Thus, it may have a membrane stabilizing effect that reduces the capillary permeability. The comparison of effects between the spaceflight group and ground control samples, it can be displayed that after the spaceflight, the anti-inflammatory activity was higher significantly.

It was demonstrated that weightlessness alone could somewhat trigger genomic alterations and result in increased gene expression, while ionizing radiation would enhance the effect of weightlessness. As two important components in licorice root, liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid play significant role not only in pharmacodynamic action but in the quantity control. In this study, the HPLC analysis showed that the contents of liquiritin and glycyrrhizic acid in licorice roots were higher in the spaceflight group than that of the ground control group. Licorice is commonly used in medicine and edible plants and anti-inflammatory activity is one of the most important pharmacological activities. In particular, ammonium glycyrrhizate and sodium glycyrrhizate are capable of suppressing the formalin-induced edema in both intact and adrenalectomized animals. The effects of glycyrrhizic acid and its aglycon (glycyrrhetic acid) observed on the model of formalin arthritis in rats was similar to the action of hydrocortisone, while the effects of the former triterpenoids on the model of carrageenan-induced inflammation were less pronounced as compared to the hydrocortisone action. At this point, the comparison of anti-inflammatory activity between the spaceflight licorice and the ground control one was conducted through three kinds of inflammatory models and evaluated the changes in pharmacological activity after the spaceflight. The experimental results showed that the anti-inflammatory activity of the space group in two species was higher than that of the ground control group. The reason for such a discrepancy is not clear but diversities of the bioactive components in individual products may affect the pharmacological activity.",

Licorice roots extract were administrated orally to rats; three acute inflammatory models demonstrated the diversity of pharmacological activity after the spaceflight.
