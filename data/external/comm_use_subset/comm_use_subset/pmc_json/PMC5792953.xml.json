            "text": "Central to the study of infectious disease dynamics is the concept of a critical threshold to pathogen invasion as a function of host density (i.e. a pathogen invasion threshold), below which a pathogen is unable to invade a host population [1,2]. This critical threshold is a commonly sought target for horticultural [1], wildlife [3] and human [4] disease control. The importance of host density to the emergence and spread of infectious disease has been demonstrated in many disease systems [5\u20137], but may be strongly influenced by environmental factors [8]. Apart from the influence of fluctuating environmental conditions, pathogen invasion thresholds may be difficult to measure in field populations as a result of data scarcity, lack of replicated experimentation and the effects of host ecology (e.g. behaviour, social structure) [9].",

This has resulted in a body of theory and indirect evidence for invasion thresholds without direct experimental evidence. In epidemiology, in particular, the basic reproduction number (R0) is a fundamental quantity that formalizes the threshold concept, providing a boundary between pathogen invasion (R0>1) and pathogen extinction (R0<1). Given that R0 is a common target for vaccination and pathogen control efforts in both theoretical [13,14] and applied [15,16] contexts, it may seem counterintuitive that pathogen invasion thresholds have largely been examined in theoretical studies. However, the estimation of R0 requires an epidemiological model capable of capturing host and pathogen dynamics, which is a challenging task for wildlife pathogens, or host\u2013pathogen interactions occurring in fluctuating environments, as fluctuating environments can change infectious period, host susceptibility or host contact patterns.",

            "text": "This challenge may be responsible for the limited support for pathogen invasion thresholds in wildlife populations [9,17\u201319]. A necessary condition for a pathogen invasion threshold is the dependence of the rate of pathogen transmission on host density, such that invasion thresholds are theoretically predicted to be absent from systems with frequency-dependent transmission [20]. For environmental and density-mediated pathogen transmission, the existence of the pathogen invasion threshold can occur simply by high host density enhancing the probability that a host contacts an infected host or an environmental pathogen spore [21]. Further, changes to behaviour or host life history as a function of density could influence invasion thresholds. For instance, transmission of an environmentally transmitted pathogen could exhibit a threshold if hosts alter their contact patterns or feeding behaviour as a function of conspecific density. Despite the inherent difficulty in examining pathogen invasion thresholds in natural systems, the generation of a body of epidemiological theory concerning pathogen invasion without experimental demonstration creates a clear knowledge gap.",

Through epidemiological modelling we further examine how parameter uncertainty can influence pathogen invasion probability, providing insight into the robustness of pathogen invasion threshold estimates. We also provide a test of the idea of the upper host density threshold [22], in which high host density results in suppressed feeding and pathogen transmission, leading to reduced pathogen transmission and subsequent pathogen invasion probability. Lastly, we examine how gradients of key epidemiological parameters can influence pathogen invasion thresholds, as many relevant parameters are subject to environmental conditions. These results demonstrate the existence of a critical host density for the invasion of an environmentally transmitted pathogen consistent with theoretical predictions, and examine how sensitive pathogen invasion thresholds may be to changes in several important parameters.",

The pathogen is transmitted during host filter-feeding, piercing the gut wall and growing inside infected hosts. During the time when the pathogen grows in an infected host, there is no pathogen shedding into the environment or host-to-host transmission. Infected hosts experience decreased fecundity, and parasite-induced mortality occurs within approximately 14 days after transmission [29]. As there is no direct (host-to-host) transmission, exposure of susceptible hosts to environmental pathogen in the environment is a necessary step in the transmission process. Infected hosts release spores into the environment upon death, which contribute to the next wave of infection when they are consumed by susceptible host individuals.",

This food concentration was constant across treatments, regardless of host density, as resource density may have a more pronounced effect on host filtering rate and subsequent pathogen transmission [32] than per capita resource levels, and feeding populations proportional to host abundance would be logistically infeasible. Since censusing occurred twice per week and feeding occurred daily, a dynamic feeding regime would be too temporally coarse, potentially leading to the introduction of further variation in population sizes and filtering rates. The resource levels provided were capable of sustaining all host densities examined, as supported by the density of individuals reaching nearly 2000 individuals l\u22121, or 100 individuals in a single 50 ml test tube.

Pathogen invasion probability was quantified in the same manner for model simulations and experimental epidemics; the minimum criteria for pathogen invasion in this system is the infection of one individual (i.e. a completion of half the life cycle of the environmentally transmitted parasite). This is because the amount of pathogen spores used to initiate the experiment was more than an order of magnitude less than the number of pathogen spores an infected host produces. Thus, the infection of one individual would suggest that R0>1, as the pathogen death rate cannot offset the contribution of pathogen spores produced by an infected host in the pathogen transmission term (u\u03b3SP). This provides a clear link between invasion probability as defined by either the observation of one infected individual or R0>1. For model simulations, pathogen invasion was defined both as R0>1 and the observation of a single infection event within the pathogen invasion window considering parameter uncertainty as described above. This is the same invasion criterion we use for primary infection events in our experimental epidemics. Further, we obtained an analytical expression for the invasion threshold (one individual becoming infected before day 11) for the stochastic model (see electronic supplementary material).",

To understand how specific parameters influence pathogen invasion thresholds, we examined model-predicted pathogen invasion thresholds along gradients of three key parameters present in R0, which correspond to pathogen transmission (\u03b3 and u) and pathogen mortality (\u03bc).

The Daphnia host\u2013pathogen model described in this paper may be generalizable to other environmentally transmitted pathogen systems [21]. For instance, an extension of our model could consider a pathogen that reproduces in the environment, or that is able to be transmitted through both direct host contact and from an environmental source [49]. Some environmentally transmitted pathogens may have dynamics similar to directly transmitted pathogens if the pathogen is short-lived and has limited dispersal [21,50]. The host\u2013pathogen system we examined is characteristic of this situation (see resulting waves of infection in electronic supplementary material, figure A4), in which transmission occurs in a small window immediately following host death, and environmental pathogen spores are relatively short-lived [31].",

That is, while invasion probabilities from the deterministic model largely overlapped the experimental data, the sigmoidal shape of the relationship in experimental data was not captured by deterministic or stochastic realizations. Further, demographic stochasticity increased the probability that the pathogen would not invade either through host extinction or the pathogen degrading in the environment before it could result in a successful infection. However, our calculation of R0 from parameters\u2014measured independently of experimental trials\u2014captured pathogen invasion in experimental trials quite well. Pathogen invasion thresholds may be more difficult to predict in natural populations where transmission may be environmentally dependent [27,31,51], creating a challenge for future research efforts to accurately capture transmission and infection dynamics in natural populations.",

Evidence that invasion thresholds may shift as a function of environmental context is provided by the range of threshold values observed for the wide range of parameter space sampled in our model, including many important parameters related to pathogen transmission (u and \u03b3), production of infectious spores (\u03b8) and pathogen demography (\u03bc). This generates a number of open questions concerning how environmental covariates, species interactions or genetic factors may influence this critical threshold. An understanding of how pathogen emergence may be influenced by environmental context is an important research area that may be informed through the use of controlled microcosm studies. Lastly, the incorporation of stochasticity into invasion threshold estimates, and the parametrization of models using existing data are both tools that could improve pathogen threshold estimation for wildlife and managed populations.",
