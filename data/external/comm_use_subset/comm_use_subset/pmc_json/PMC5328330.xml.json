However, recent studies suggest that personnel frequently use incorrect technique for donning and doffing PPE [2,3]. Lapses in technique can lead to an increased risk for contamination of skin and clothing with healthcare-associated pathogens [2,4]. Such contamination contributes to transmission of pathogens such as Clostridium difficile [5] and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [1], and places patients and medical personnel at risk for acquisition of infection, including with potentially fatal pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, and Ebola virus [6,7].",

We are not aware of previous studies that have specifically evaluated training of medical students in correct use of PPE. Given the need to train medical students in a variety of infection control practices, a practical approach may be to incorporate PPE training into general sessions designed to train personnel in infection control measures. Incorporation of fluorescent lotions or powders into PPE training sessions may be valuable to provide immediate visual feedback on routes and sites of contamination [2]. Use of these methods with a requirement for demonstration of proficiency within an Objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) or routine clinical setting may be effective in reducing the risk for contamination [16\u201318].",
