The application of evolutionary concepts to epidemiological surveillance and outbreak control has been transformed in recent years by the increasing availability of viral genome sequences, the growth in computer processing power, and the development of sophisticated analytical methods (e.g. [6]). Information gleaned from genetic data has the potential to identify factors that influence the spread and evolution of viral diseases. An evolutionary approach to epidemiology provides several benefits when combined with traditional methods, as it allows reconstruction of epidemic transmission history from a small number of pathogens sampled shortly after the discovery of an outbreak, the estimation of migration histories, and the inference of transmission links among cases that may not be evident using data on spatio-temporal incidence alone.",

As a consequence the pattern of genetic differences among viruses sampled from a population contains information about transmission history. Specifically, phylogeographic and statistical studies of virus genomes sampled through space and time can answer questions relating to the geographic dissemination of epidemics e.g. [4, 10] and numerous methods are available to infer patterns of spatial spread from genetic data, e.g. [11\u201315]. However, the explanatory power of viral phylogeography would be greater if it could identify and test the effects of specific aspects of the environment on spatial spread and growth. This question represents a major focus of current research in viral phylogeography.",

[15] developed a method based on relaxed random walk models that can reconstruct virus dispersal in continuous space using viral genomes sampled from known locations at known times. This method co-estimates both the virus phylogeny and the locations of unsampled common ancestors, thereby producing a full spatial dispersal history of the sampled infections. This history includes an estimate of the location of epidemic origin and of the velocity, direction and heterogeneity of spatial spread. The method has been used in several studies to reconstruct the spatial spread of pathogenic viruses, including crop diseases, dengue virus, West Nile virus and avian influenza viruses [16\u201318]. However, while this method can place phylogenies in a geographical context, it does not explicitly incorporate environmental differences across the geographic landscape within which transmission occurs. Such heterogeneity may have a significant effect on spatial dissemination, especially for outbreaks in natural animal and plant populations e.g. [19\u201321].",

This is the \u201cphylogeographic GLM\u201d approach [22, 23] that estimates rates of lineage movement among a fixed number of discrete locations, and in doing so parameterises each among-location rate as a linear function of one or more predictor variables. The coefficients of the linear model are then co-estimated with the among-location rates, the phylogeny, and other parameters, using Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference. However, this framework is only currently applicable to discretised spatial locations and is more suited to hypotheses concerning human mobility among population centres via transportation hubs, such as airports [23, 24] and is less suitable for hypotheses concerning the dissemination of animal and plant pathogens throughout natural landscapes. Further, it is computationally demanding because predictor variables are assessed whilst sampling phylogenies using a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. There is therefore a need for complementary approaches.",

This framework uses spatial information obtained from phylogeography to study the impact of environmental variables on epidemic dispersal in continuous space. Our method differs from previous approaches in that it explicitly separates the task of testing correlates of lineage dispersal from the task of inferring the history of movement from genetic data. This separation has two benefits. First, it allows large numbers of environmental variables to be assessed without the need for phylogenetic MCMC sampling. Second, it increases flexibility, because it can be applied to any dispersal history, irrespective of the specific phylogeographic method or software package that was used to infer that history. We illustrate our framework by applying it to a well-characterised viral outbreak, the spread of rabies in raccoons across the north-east of the USA over approximately thirty years (hereafter referred as the raccoon rabies epidemic). This data set has been analysed using previous phylogeographic methods [15, 25], thus enabling direct comparison with the results obtained here.",

A full description of each step is provided in the next section.(i)In the first step, the history of lineage dispersal is recovered from one or more spatial- and temporally-referenced phylogenies (i.e. trees whose branches represent time and whose tips and internal nodes all have a defined location). Such trees are generated by the continuous phylogeography method implemented in BEAST [15], but it is important to note that our method is applicable phylogenies from any source that are annotated with dates and locations in the same way (Fig. 1a). The velocity, distance and duration of spatial movement along each branch in each tree are extracted and represented by a vector.(ii) In a second, optional, step, the spatio-temporal data extracted in step (i) is used to calculate summary statistics of spatial spread, such as the velocity of the epidemic wavefront.(iii) Each of the vectors obtained in step (i) is assigned a \u201cweight\u201d score, which is calculated using a raster that defines the spatial heterogeneity of a specified environmental variable (e.g. elevation, human population density, land cover, etc.). We have implemented three different models of spatial movement (hereafter called \u201cpath models\u201d) to compute the \u201cweight\u201d allocated to each phylogeny branch for a given environmental raster. (a) The \u201cstraight-line path\u201d model, which assumes that movement is in a straight-line between the start and end locations of each branch. (b) The \u201cleast-cost path\u201d model, which uses a least-cost algorithm [26] to determine the route taken between the start and end points. (c) The \u201crandom walk path\u201d model, which uses circuit theory [27] to accommodate uncertainty in the route taken. Note that for models (b) and (c), each environmental raster must be considered twice, once as a conductance factor (i.e. it facilitates movement) and once as a resistance factor (i.e. it impedes movement).(iv) The correlation between the duration of each phylogeny branch and its \u201cweight\u201d (see step iii) is then estimated. Correlations are repeated for each environmental raster, and for each of the three path models described above.(v) Finally, the statistical significance of these correlations is tested using a null model. To generate this null model, we implement a simple randomisation procedure: phylogenetic node positions are randomised within the study area, under the constraint that branch lengths, tree topology and root position are unchanged (see Fig. 1b).",

In order to compute these \u201cweights\u201d, we have implemented three different \u201cpath models\u201d which represent the path taken by a phylogeny branch as it travels between its start and end locations:(i)Straight-line path: each lineage travels in a straight line between its start and end location. In this case, the branch \u201cweight\u201d is computed as the sum of the values of the raster cells through which the straight line passes.(ii) Least-cost path: each lineage travels via the least-cost path between its start and end location [26]. With this model, the branch \u201cweight\u201d is computed as the sum of the transition values between adjacent cells along the least-cost path [28].(iii) Random walk path: each lineage travels via a random walk between its start and end location. In this case, the \u201cweight\u201d is a graph-theoretic metric based on circuit theory, which takes into account multiple possible pathways connecting a given pair of locations, and the values of the raster cells through which they pass [27, 29]. Specifically, for each lineage, one node is connected to a one-ampere current source, while the other is connected to ground. The \u201cweight\u201d between each pair of nodes is then defined by the effective electric resistance or conductance connecting them on the grid, i.e. the environmental raster in question [27]. More details about the circuit theory model can be found in [27] and [29].",

For example, if an environmental raster is treated as a resistance factor then raster cells with low values will be more permeable to dispersal and those with high values will correspond to poor dispersal habitat or to movement barriers [27]. When there is no prior information about whether a given variable will facilitate or impede lineage movement, it is prudent to consider it twice, once as a potential conductance factor, and once as a potential resistance factor. By default, we use the environmental values as resistance or conductance values. Log-transformed and/or standardised values may be necessary if the current univariate approach is in future extended to a multivariate one (see Conclusion). Note, when all cells in a raster are identically-valued (i.e. there is no spatial variation in the environmental factor) then the total \u201cweight\u201d for any path is simply proportional to its geographic distance. A special case exists when all cells have values equal to 1, which we here define as the \u201cnull raster\u201d.",

Specifically, we use the statistic D = (R2env - R2null), where R2env is the R2 obtained when branch durations are regressed against weights defined by the environmental raster, and R2null is the R2 obtained when branch durations are regressed against weights defined by the null raster (i.e. when only the spatial distance of each movement event is considered). All environmental raster cell values are increased by 1 (except for cells with no data) to enable a direct comparison of R2env and R2null. D is therefore a correlation measure relative to a null hypothesis and represents the degree to which the regression is strengthened when spatial variation in the environmental variable is taken into account.",

In order to calculate a null distribution for the D statistic, we have implemented a randomisation procedure that randomises phylogenetic node positions under the constraint that branch lengths (i.e. branch durations), the tree topology and the root position are unchanged (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, this randomisation procedure is not applied to the entire raster but to a subset of it defined by the minimum convex hull around a set of locations. The set of locations comprises the start and end positions of each branch in the spatiotemporally-referenced input phylogenies. During the randomisation, if a randomised branch position falls outside the area defined by this convex hull, the algorithm randomises its position again until it does not fall outside this area. By constraining permutation within this convex hull we are, in effect, using the data to inform the relevant study area. In contrast, the square raster inputted by the user may be of arbitrary size and orientation. Without this constraint, randomised phylogenies will fall in areas with different environmental values, potentially leading to type I errors. The result of this procedure is one p-value per input phylogeny, which equals the proportion of randomisation replicates that generated D values larger than that generated by the empirical input phylogeny. If multiple input trees are used then a distribution of p-values is obtained and we report the percentage of p-values > 0.05. It is worth noting that the statistical significance of our test is derived from a randomisation distribution, not from a distribution derived from the regression model. Hence the coefficients of determination R2env and R2null are treated only as data statistics, and therefore our test is not dependent on regression model assumptions (such as homoscedasticity).",

These statistics include the epidemic wavefront and patristic distances through time (Figs. 3a and b), and parameters that describe dispersal velocities and diffusion coefficients (Figs. 3c and d). The epidemic wavefront plot (Fig. 3a) shows that the spatial extent of the raccoon rabies epidemic increased at a relatively constant rate until around 1990. The patristic distance (i.e. the distance summed along tree branches) at this time is greater (> 1,000 km) than the spatial distance (750\u2013800 km). The difference between these two measures is to be expected, because the patristic distance includes movements in all directions, including those back towards the epidemic origin (Fig. 3b). Hence dispersal was diffusive in nature and did not always follow the shortest or most direct path from epidemic origin to epidemic wavefront. Kernel density graphs of the mean lineage velocity (Fig. 3c) and phylogenetic diffusion coefficient (Fig. 3d) indicate significant variation in these parameters among lineages. The estimated mean lineage velocity was ~37 km/year (Fig. 3c), similar to that reported for dengue virus in Vietnam (6\u201338 km/year [17]) but substantially smaller than that of the West Nile virus epidemic in North America (1,500 km/year [18]). These statistics are helpful in quantifying the spatial dynamics of an epidemic and can also be used to compare different outbreaks.

Formally, D = R2env - R2null, where R2env is the coefficient of determination obtained when branch durations are regressed against branch weights calculated using raster E, and R2null is the coefficient of determination obtained when branch durations are regressed against branch weights defined by a null raster with no spatial variation (i.e. a raster whose cells all have value 1). If D \u2264 0, then the environmental variable E does not explain variation in branch duration better than geographic distance alone. However, if D is strongly positive, then the values of E are strongly associated with branches that move more rapidly or more slowly than average.",

Results are shown for each of the three path models (straight-line, least-cost, and random walk models). In this example, there is comparatively little difference among path models in the strength of the relationship between branch durations and branch weights. For all three path models, R2env is approximately twice as great as R2null, so the corresponding D values are positive (0.132 for the straight-line model; 0.151 for the least-cost model; 0.138 for the random walk model). Thus while geographic distance alone explains a small part of among-lineage variation in velocity (i.e. R2null), this variation is better explained when the geographic elevation of the path taken by each lineage is taken into account (i.e. R2env).
