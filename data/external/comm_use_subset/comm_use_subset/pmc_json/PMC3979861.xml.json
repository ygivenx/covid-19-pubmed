Nairobi sheep disease was first reported in 1910 in Nairobi, Kenya and, in 1917, NSDV was shown to be the causative agent of the disease by Montgomery and colleagues [2]. The virus is endemic in East and Central Africa [2]\u2013[7] and an Asian virus causing the same disease in India is called Ganjam virus (GV) (reviewed in [8]). Based on genetic and serological studies, these viruses were identified as different isolates of the same virus [9], [10].",

Sheep and goats are the only known mammalian reservoir for NSDV [3], [4]; other livestock (e.g. cattle, horses) are refractory to the disease [2]. While the virus has a limited effect on animals bred in the enzootic areas due to the development of immunity by these animals while they are still protected by maternal antibodies, NSDV causes large economic losses during transport of animals through enzootic areas or during introduction of new livestock to these areas [2], [14]\u2013[16].

After Dengue virus (DENV), CCHFV is the second most widespread of the arboviruses pathogenic to humans [20]\u2013[28].

While work on CCHFV is limited to biosafety level (BSL) 4 laboratories and restricted by lack of a natural animal model to study the disease, NSDV may act as a suitable model to study haemorrhagic nairoviruses.",

            "text": "Replication of nairoviruses occurs in the cytoplasm, where the N and L proteins are also synthesised [54], [55], while the viral glycoproteins are generated on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated ribosomes [49], [50], [56]\u2013[59]. Newly synthesised virions bud into the Golgi and are transported, probably through the secretory pathway, to the plasma membrane, where the virions exit the infected cell after fusion of the carrier vesicle with the plasma membrane [35], [36], [60]. The M segment mRNA is thought to be translated as a single polyprotein, which is further processed by the cellular signal protease [48], [50] to generate the glycoproteins PreGn and PreGc; in CCHFV these precursors are further processed into mature glycoproteins Gn and Gc in a process which employs other cellular proteases [50], [57]\u2013[59]. Since the glycoproteins of nairoviruses mature in the ER and Golgi, and newly generated virions bud in the Golgi, nairoviruses would be expected to affect the secretory pathway. However the effect of nairovirus replication on specific cellular compartments has not been studied; in this study we used specific antibodies in combination with laser scanning confocal microscopy to study the effects of NSDV on the secretory pathway of infected cells. We observed that while NSDV replication has no obvious effect on the structure of the ER, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or the Golgi, it induces redistribution of luminal ER oxidoreductases protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) and ERp57, proteins which are involved in the formation and rearrangement of disulphide bonds during protein folding. In NSDV-infected cells, both PDI and ERp57 are translocated from the ER to the cell surface and to the medium surrounding the infected cells, a process which seems to depend on the NSDV glycoprotein precursor PreGn.",

After overnight infection, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for ERGIC (ERGIC53), cisGolgi (GM130) or transGolgi (p102) markers. Infected cells were detected using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the viral N protein (which recognises both NSDVi and NSDVu isolates), and the distribution of the cellular proteins was compared in infected and uninfected cells by confocal microscopy. Apart from a few infected cells where the N protein appeared to fill up the space occupied by the ERGIC, no obvious changes to the distribution or amount of ERGIC53 was observed (Figure 1.A a\u2013c). Similar results were observed for the cis and transGolgi compartments, with no obvious changes to the distribution of GM130 and p102 (which are matrix proteins of the cis and transGolgi respectively [63], [66]) when infected cells were compared to uninfected cells (Figure 1.A d\u2013i). NSDV replication did not appear to affect protein levels of these markers, as judged by fluorescence intensity. The same results were obtained for NSDVi-infected A549 cells, and for Vero and A549 cells infected with NSDVu (data not shown). These results indicate that, despite budding into the Golgi, often shedding large numbers of the virus particles [35], NSDV does not appear to alter ERGIC and Golgi structures (at least not sufficiently for the alteration to be detected by confocal microscopy). This suggests that the Golgi and ERGIC remain functional during infection, thereby promoting viral egress. NSDV replication also had no apparent effect on microtubule and actin filament organisation (Figure S1); in addition, several NSDV-infected cells were found undergoing mitosis, showing a well-defined mitotic spindle as observed by \u03b1-tubulin staining, indicating that the centrioles likewise remained functional in NSDV-infected cells (Figure S1).",

When staining cells with mouse anti-PDI antibody clone 1D3, which targets the C-terminal part of PDI, containing the KDEL retention motif [67], we discovered that in many infected cells the amount of PDI appeared to decrease, even disappearing completely from the ER of about 1 in 3 infected cells (Figure 2 a\u2013c). To exclude the possibility that the viral glycoproteins mask the epitope recognised by the antibody clone 1D3, the experiment was repeated using mouse anti-PDI antibody clone RL90, which targets a different PDI epitope from that recognised by 1D3, since it inhibits the activity of PDI in vitro\n[68] and therefore recognises a region close to the enzymatic site of the protein. Once again, many infected cells showed a reduced amount of PDI in the ER (Figure 2 d\u2013f), confirming that, in NSDV-infected cells, PDI shows a different staining pattern than in uninfected cells, and that many infected cells even appear to lose PDI entirely. The distribution of ERp57, another soluble chaperone of the PDI-like family, was also studied in NSDV-infected cells; again many infected cells showed a similar redistribution or complete loss of ERp57 from the ER (Figure 2 g\u2013i), indicating that other ER-lumenal chaperones/proteins might also be affected. The fraction of infected cells in which PDI distribution was affected was quantified visually. The amount of PDI in the ER of 150 infected and uninfected cells was investigated and approximately 33% of infected cells (53/150) were found to show either a drastically reduced level or total loss of intracellular PDI, while only 1 uninfected cell was seen with low/absent PDI in the ER (\u03c72 = 58.7, p<0.00001).",

Surprisingly, given the confocal results, NSDVi infection appeared to have no effect on the total PDI and ERp57 protein levels (Figure 3). In the case of very abundant proteins such as PDI, which represents around 1% of total cellular proteins (reviewed in [69]), a small difference in protein level might not be detected by Western blotting; however, during NSDV infection, 33% of the infected cells showed major or total loss of PDI (as estimated using immunofluorescence), therefore some change in the total PDI level would be expected to be seen if this protein was degraded in the infected cells.

One possibility was that these proteins are moving to the cell surface in infected cells, but are lost during fixation and washing, since PDI is known to be only weakly bound to the cell surface via non-covalent interactions with other molecules present at the cell surface [70]. This possibility was investigated using careful surface labelling of lightly fixed cells and confocal microscopy. To detect PDI and ERp57 at the surface, Vero cells infected with NSDVi at a low MOI were fixed and then incubated with anti-PDI or anti-ERp57 antibody without permeabilization. After washing away unbound antibodies, cells were again fixed with 3% PFA to ensure that any PDI/ERp57 and bound antibodies remained attached to the cell surface throughout the staining procedure. To detect NSDV proteins, cells were then permeabilised with ice-cold methanol and incubated with rabbit anti-NSDV N protein serum or with mouse anti-NSDVi PreGn (a monoclonal which recognises a sequence near the amino-terminus of the NSDVi PreGn glycoprotein). We observed that many NSDV-infected cells showed significant amounts of cell surface PDI and ERp57 (Figure 4.A). Although small amounts of PDI and ERp57 could be observed at the surface of even uninfected cells, NSDV infection led to a large increase in the amount of these proteins at the surface. Approximately 1/3rd of infected cells (calculated as a fraction (51/150) of viral protein-positive cells with increased surface PDI/ERp57 calculated over several focal views) showed this high level of surface PDI/ERp57, and only 1/150 uninfected cells showed increased surface PDI/ERp57 (\u03c72 = 55.8, p<0.00001). We did observe a small fraction of cells the membranes of which were permeabilised by the initial fixation, leading to labelling of internal PDI or ERp57; however, surface PDI/ERp57 staining showed a completely different pattern to the resultant intracellular (ER) staining.",

Enhanced surface PDI was detected in batches of infected but not in uninfected cells (Figure 4.B), confirming that surface PDI detected in NSDV-infected cells is not an artefact of the staining procedure.

Vero cells were infected at high MOI and fixed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 hours post infection (hpi), after which PDI was labelled in the ER or at the surface. The first changes to PDI distribution could be observed at 8 hpi, when a few cells showed a reduced amount of PDI in the ER (observed visually as a clearly weaker fluorescence signal when compared to uninfected cells) and vesicle-like structures containing PDI could be noticed (Figure 6 a\u2013c). At 12 hpi, several cells which had completely lost detectable PDI from the ER were observed (Figure 6 d\u2013f) and at 16 hpi many cells lacking PDI were found (Figure 6 g\u2013i). The first surface PDI was only seen at 16 hpi (Figure 6 j\u2013l); however, it is possible that a small increase of surface PDI would be missed at earlier time points due to the relatively low sensitivity of confocal microscopy. Similar results were obtained for ERp57 (Figure S3). Interestingly, despite synchronising infection by washing away unbound virus 1 h post inoculation, it was observed that infection had not progressed to the same degree in all infected cells, so that, at 8 hpi, only a few cells showed detectable viral N protein, while at 12 hpi, at which time progeny virus can be detected [29], cells with very different amounts of N were observed (Figure 6). This apparent variation in the extent of virus replication in individual cells from the same sample may be due to variation in the virions themselves (e.g. individual virus particles having different numbers of copies of each segment) or due to the virus replicating with different rates in different cells, possibly due to some effect of cell cycle, as the cell cycle of the cells used in this experiment was not synchronised.",

Vero cells were again infected with NSDVi and culture supernatants (i.e. the cell medium) and the cells themselves were harvested, and proteins from supernatants and/or cell lysates were analysed by Western blotting using specific antibodies. Before harvesting, cells were checked by light microscopy for the appearance of any cytopathic effect (CPE), to ensure that only the medium from cells which appeared healthy was used in this study. After 48 h, in cells infected with NSDVi at a low MOI, no CPE was observed in the culture, but a clear increase in levels of PDI and ERp57 was detected in the medium. These proteins were found in the medium from infected cells but not from uninfected cells (Figure 7), while cellular proteins such as tubulin or calnexin were not found in the medium (Figure 7), indicating that the PDI, ERp57 and NSDV N protein were not simply coming from ruptured cells.",

It is therefore possible that the viral glycoproteins may be involved in the redistribution of PDI/ERp57 in infected cells. In order to visualise this directly, we labelled infected cells with rabbit anti-ERp57 and mouse anti-PreGn. It was observed that ERp57 is redistributed in infected cells so that it is essentially all in the specific areas occupied by viral glycoproteins (Figure 8.A), suggesting that these chaperones may be recruited to the parts of the ER involved in synthesising the viral glycoproteins. Although we could not carry out a similar study of PDI/PreGn colocalisation (no good rabbit anti-PDI was found), a similar association of PDI and viral glycoprotein is strongly suggested by studies in which we lysed infected cells and immunoextracted the lysates using mouse anti-PDI (clone RL90) antibody. We found PreGn, but not N, among proteins co-precipitated by anti-PDI antibody from infected cells (Figure 8.B), indicating that PDI appears to interact, directly or indirectly, with PreGn and possibly other of the viral glycoproteins in NSDV-infected cells (Figure 8.B) (note that reverse immunoprecipitation with anti-PreGn was not possible since the monoclonal antibody in question appears to recognise only denatured PreGn).",

In silico analysis of the protein sequence encoded by the NSDV M segment suggested that the NSDV glycoproteins have a similar organisational arrangement to that described for CCHFV [50], although with some differences in the exact lengths of the different proteins. Transmembrane (TM) regions and signalase cleavage sites were predicted using TMHMM Server v. 2.0 and SignalP 4.0 Server [75] respectively; six hydrophobic regions TM0 (N-terminal), TM1 (631-653 aa), TM2 (751-773 aa), TM3 (786-803 aa), TM4 (907-928 aa) and TM5 (1524-1546 aa) were predicted with signalase cleavage sites just after the hydrophobic sequences of TM0 (19\u219320 aa), TM2 (770\u2193771 aa) and TM4 (927\u2193928 aa). Based on the NSDV M topology prediction, plasmids encoding PreGn, NSM and PreGc (corresponding respectively to aa 1\u2013770, 750\u2013927 and 907\u20131624 of the NSDVi M open reading frame) were constructed in which each protein was in frame with a carboxy-terminal V5 epitope tag. Expression of these constructs was tested in Vero cells by Western blotting and immunofluorescence to ensure that proteins of the expected size and localising to the expected compartments were expressed. The plasmid-expressed PreGn-V5 was found in the ER and cisGolgi, while the PreGc-V5 was found only in the ER, with no detectable colocalisation with the cisGolgi marker (Figure S5 a\u2013f). Some of the plasmid-expressed NSM-V5 protein colocalised with the cisGolgi marker, however NSM-V5 also appeared in other compartments of the secretory pathway, one of which could be ERGIC (Figure S5 g\u2013i).",

Cells which expressed PreGn-V5 lost PDI from the ER (Figure 9 a\u2013c), while expression of PreGc-V5 or NSM-V5 had no apparent effect on the PDI distribution (Figure 9 d\u2013i), suggesting that it is the (Pre)Gn but not (Pre)Gc or NSM which is primarily responsible for the translocation of PDI, and possibly ERp57, to the cell surface. Although in some cells over-accumulation of PreGn-V5 appeared to change the morphology of the ER, the cells which showed only moderate or low levels of PreGn-V5 in the ER also lost PDI from this compartment. In cells in which PreGn-V5 was found only in the Golgi (i.e. cells which expressed PreGn at a very low level) no change to PDI was observed, suggesting that PreGn needs to accumulate in the ER, even at low levels, in order to affect the distribution of PDI. PreGn-V5 had no effect on the distribution of calnexin (Figure 9 j\u2013l), indicating that the PreGn-V5 does not affect the overall ER structure when expressed at moderate levels, similarly to what was observed in NSDV-infected cells. As expected, expression of the viral N protein or the N-terminal half of the viral L protein (La) [62] had no effect on PDI distribution (Figure S6).",

While what appear to be swollen Golgi cisternae and vacuolisation of the cytoplasm has been observed by electron microscopy in NSDV-infected cells [35], it is possible that changes to the Golgi observed by electron microscopy are not extensive enough to be detected by confocal microscopy, or are not reflected in changes to the distribution of protein markers of those compartments. Our findings agree with the absence of changes to the Golgi observed in cells infected with CCHFV or Hantaan virus (HTNV; a hantavirus) [76], [77]. In contrast, Bunyamwera virus (BUNV; an orthobunyavirus)-infected cells showed a condensed phenotype of the cis and transGolgi [78]\u2013[80], indicating that different bunyaviruses may have different effects on the Golgi. While the ERGIC has been proposed as the first site of budding for phleboviruses, orthobunyaviruses and hantaviruses [76], [79]\u2013[83], no specific accumulation of the NSDV N colocalising with the ERGIC marker was observed in our studies.

Redistribution of PDI has been observed also during replication of other viruses. For instance, PDI was redistributed from the peripheral ER to perinuclear membranous viral factories induced by Kunjin virus (KUNV; genus Flavivirus) [84]. It is currently unknown whether KUNV selectively redistributes PDI or also affects other ER proteins; since the KUNV glycoproteins E and M mature in the ER [85] and KUNV generates its viral factories by remodelling both the ER and transGolgi [84], it is possible that in KUNV-infected cells the normal retrieval system of ER proteins may not work. Interestingly, despite changes to the ER, no major effect on the Golgi structure was found by immunofluorescence in KUNV-infected cells [84]. Another flavivirus, Dengue virus (DENV) (which, like NSDV, can cause a haemorrhagic fever), increased surface levels of PDI in infected endothelial cells [86]. As in our observations on NSDV-infected cells, total PDI levels were not affected in DENV-infected cells [86]; at present it is unknown whether DENV replication affects the distribution of intracellular PDI. Although some redistribution of PDI was found in BUNV-infected Vero cells, these changes most probably result from fragmentation of the ER induced by the virus and this effect on PDI appears to be Vero\u2013specific, since these changes have not been observed in BUNV-infected BHK21 cells [79]. No effect on PDI was detected in HTNV-infected cells [76].",

In ASFV-infected cells, PDI, ERp57 and colligin were redistributed from the ER to the ERGIC (which contained the ASFV protein pXP124L) or even entirely disappeared from the ER, while the structure of the ER was not affected [87]. Total cellular levels of PDI, ERp57, and colligin were not affected in ASFV-infected cells and redistribution of these ER soluble proteins was also observed in cells containing plasmid-expressed viral protein pXP124L, suggesting that these ER proteins are not physically redistributed due to wrapping of the ASFV progeny virions in the ER but due to a specific effect of pXP124L. Interestingly, all these very distinct viruses (a negative-strand RNA virus, positive-strand RNA viruses or a DNA virus) use membranes of the secretory pathway to assemble their virions [35], [85], [89], [90], and NSDV, DENV and ASFV all cause haemorrhagic disease [2], [91], [92].",

PDI and ERp57, which contain an ER retention motif at their carboxy-terminus, would normally be bound to KDEL receptors in the ERGIC or cisGolgi and recycled back to the ER, although it is known that this process is not totally efficient, and PDI at least has been observed to be released from some cells even under normal conditions [70], [74]. What is more, its release is stimulated in activated endothelial cells [93], [94]. As might be expected due to the generation of large amounts of viral glycoproteins in the ER, NSDV induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in infected cells (unpublished observation); however, it has been reported that the UPR appeared to diminish PDI secretion [74], so it is unlikely that virus-induced UPR is the cause of the PDI redistribution observed. None of the predicted glycoproteins of NSDV have a C-terminal sequence recognised by KDEL receptors, so the viral proteins cannot be competing with the host cell proteins for KDEL receptors, unlike the case of ASFV pXP124L, the effects of which on ER proteins is dependent on its own C-terminal KDEL motif [87].",

It remains to be determined why the PDI is not recycled from the ERGIC or cisGolgi in this case, and why only the PreGn protein appears to be involved in PDI distribution and not PreGc. It is possible that bound PreGn makes PDI not available for KDEL receptor. While we have been unable to detect a separate mucin-like protein/GP38 protein, such as that cleaved from the CCHFV PreGn protein by an SKI-1-like protease in the cisGolgi [57], [58], in NSDV-infected cells, it may be that final folding of the NSDV (Pre)Gn occurs late in the exit pathway of the virion so that PDI is still required for protein maturation, even after virion assembly. Further maturation of newly synthesised virions in post-transGolgi network has been observed in BUNV-infected cells [79], [80], supporting the possibility that PDI might play a role in late maturation of NSDV. Late maturation, or even virion-bound PDI, may be required to prevent fusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of the secretory compartments during virus egress. Fusion of the CCHFV virion with the endosomal membrane is induced at pH 5.5 to 6.0 [98], which is within the range of pH observed in the lumen of post-Golgi compartments (reviewed in [99]), so a system which prevented fusion of newly synthesised virions with intracellular membranes prior to virus egress would be of benefit.",

Extracellular PDI has been shown to activate \u03b21 and \u03b23 subunit-containing integrins on endothelial cells and platelets [86], [93], [109]. Integrins are known to take part in the cell-cell interactions promoting cell migration and vasodilation (reviewed in [110]), processes which are enhanced during viral haemorrhagic fevers and which contribute to the haemorrhagic nature of the pathogenesis (reviewed in [111]) e.g. DENV-induced translocation of PDI to the cells surface has been shown to activate integrins on infected endothelial cells [86]. Secreted PDI could also activate integrins at the surface of various uninfected cells, including endothelial cells and platelets, leading to increased vasodilatation and coagulopathy. Extracellular PDI has been shown to activate tissue factor (TF) [112], inducing intravascular coagulation, which may subsequently lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) through depletion of platelets and clotting factors, resulting in haemorrhaging [113]\u2013[116]; DIC has been observed in many CCHF patients [31]\u2013[33], [117].",

Redistribution of PDI from the ER of NSDV-infected cells to the cell surface and/or the extracellular environment may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of NSDV. PDI may enhance virus infection or may contribute to the observed haemorrhagic outcome of the infection, although the exact importance of extracellular PDI and ERp57 in natural infection remains to be determined. In recent years, PDI has become a popular potential drug target for treatment of thrombosis, neurodegenerative diseases and HIV infection [69], [121], [122] and it appears that PDI could also act as a target for treatment of at least some viral haemorrhagic fevers [86]. While a wide range of applications makes PDI inhibitors attractive agents, extracellular PDI appears to take part in a broad range of physiological functions, and therefore drug safety might become a limiting factor for the development of drugs which interfere with enzymatic activity of extracellular PDI.",
