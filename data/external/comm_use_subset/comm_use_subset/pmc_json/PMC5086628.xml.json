            "text": "A number of life-threatening human diseases are caused by viruses as diverse as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola, yellow fever, Zika, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona viruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively). Though these viruses are taxonomically and genetically distinct, they are all enveloped viruses and therefore possess a lipid bilayer that protects the viral capsid and genetic material that is inside the viral particle. Despite the efforts to eradicate these diseases, a number of them continue to affect us either as pandemic diseases or as outbreaks that appear from time to time. For example, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), by the end of 2015 there were nearly 37 million people infected with HIV, with two million new cases and about one million deaths occurring that year (http://www.who.int/). On the other hand, nearly 29,000 cases and over 11,000 deaths were reported during the most recent Ebola outbreak that started in 2014. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the corona virus family that includes the common cold. Outbreaks of both viruses (SARS-CoV in Asia in 2003 and MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia in 2012) led to several thousand cases of SARS and MERS, and hundreds of deaths. Efforts to create vaccines against these viral diseases have been successful in some cases such as yellow fever, but other cases like HIV have been more challenging.",

These proteins constitute the first encounter with the host and the most exposed target that the immune system can attack; hence viruses have evolved to hide the features that would make them more susceptible to antibody neutralization. These strategies include hiding fundamental structural motifs through oligomerization or conformational occlusion, rapid mutation rates that lead to high sequence variability in non-essential regions such as variable loops, and extensive posttranslational glycosylation. Vaccine development against enveloped viruses has mostly focused on targeting the envelope glycoproteins primarily because they are the sole targets of neutralizing antibodies. Some viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV, have thus far eluded vaccine efforts, mostly due to the high variability among strains, high mutation rates within a given virus, and physical masking of neutralizing epitopes [3,4]. Development of vaccines against diseases that appear as outbreaks, such as Ebola and SARS-CoV, are also challenging because of the lack of infected patient populations necessary for testing efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics. Other diseases such as yellow fever can be prevented by vaccination.",

            "text": "For those diseases in which vaccine development has been challenging, other therapies have nevertheless been developed. HIV is arguably the most studied viral disease; highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) consisting of a combination of small molecule antiretroviral drugs has progressively improved the lives of patients in some parts of the world, and effectively extends life expectancy. Antiretroviral drugs target different proteins and enzymes essential for the virus life cycle. On the other hand, antibody therapeutics are emerging as powerful alternative forms of therapy against HIV and other diseases. Such therapies depend on isolation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, primarily from patient sera, that will bind specifically to the envelope glycoprotein of the virus. Another way to treat viral diseases that is currently being studied is through the use of proteins capable of targeting the glycans present on the surface of the envelope glycoproteins, namely, lectins [5,6]. Lectins are sugar-binding proteins that are ubiquitous, present in microorganisms, plants and animals. They participate in many important cellular processes including cell\u2013cell interactions and protein folding. Some lectins provide protection to the host from other organisms. Lectins have been developed widely as probes to investigate cell surface structure and functions; they have also found applications as antiviral drugs and in the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. A number of lectins capable of binding the high-mannose glycans commonly found in the surface of the envelope glycoproteins are currently under study to be used as microbicides [7,8]. Some of the most promising antiviral lectins include griffithsin (GRFT), cyanovirin (CV-N) and banana lectin (BanLec). Their use has been mostly suggested as antiviral microbicides, acting as a barrier to prevent transmission of HIV through their incorporation into vaginal and rectal gels, creams or suppositories. In such systems, they can bind the viruses and prevent viral entry and fusion to target cells, thereby preventing infection. This review summarizes the activity, biochemical, biophysical and structural data available for GRFT, one of the most potent anti-HIV agents reported to date.",

            "text": "Griffithsin was discovered as an anti-HIV lead by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). GRFT was isolated from a marine red alga Griffithsia sp. present in the NCI Natural Products Repository. Mass spectroscopic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data indicated the active compound was a protein rather than a small molecule natural product. Its sequence was determined through a combination of N-terminal Edman degradation of the intact protein and N-terminal sequencing of peptide fragments obtained from endopeptidase and cyanogen bromide treatments [9]. The wild-type protein from the alga contained an uncommon amino acid of 151.05 Da at position 31 that was replaced by alanine (Ala) in recombinant protein preparations without affecting anti-HIV activity. GRFT has no homology to any other proteins previously reported. It has been shown to have anti-HIV activity against T cell tropic and macrophage-tropic viruses. It is capable of inhibiting cell\u2013cell fusion between chronically infected and uninfected cells and its efficacy as an antiviral agent against other enveloped viruses has also been shown (see Section 6).",

To that end GRFT has been expressed recombinantly in different organisms (Table 1). It was first expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli (E. coli) with a polyhistidine tag on the N-terminus to facilitate purification by metal affinity chromatography [9,10]. Expression of GRFT in Nicotiana benthamiana using an infectious tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based vector has yielded gram amounts of the protein [11,12]. Expression in rice seeds through the stable transformation of plants has also been reported [13]. Purification of GRFT has been also optimized, including the use of ceramic filtration followed by two-stage chromatography [11], and a combination of heat, magnesium chloride and bentonite, followed by a single chromatographic step [14]. Importantly, GRFT expression and purification has been proven robust, an essential feature in making a drug available for clinical testing.",

            "text": "Griffithsin exists as a stable homodimer where each subunit contains 121 amino acids (Figure 1A). It has no cysteines in its sequence and no homology to any other proteins. Structures of GRFT in the absence of any ligand as well as in the presence of different monosaccharides and disaccharides have been solved by X-ray crystallography [15,16,17]. GRFT folds into a domain-swapped dimer (Figure 1B), where each subunit presents nearly perfect internal three-fold symmetry. The structure is composed by three repeats of an antiparallel four-stranded \u03b2-sheet [15] that superficially resembles a \u03b2-prism-I motif found in other lectins of the jacalin family. Two out of 12 \u03b2-strands (16 amino acids) swap from one monomer to the other to form a \u03b2-prism of three four-stranded sheets. Each subunit of the homodimer griffithsin is capable of binding three monosaccharides. Each binding site is located in an equilateral triangle, with each site separated by approximately 15 \u00c5 (Figure 1C). Crystal structures with the monosaccharides mannose, glucose and N-acetylglycosamine, and the disaccharides 1-6\u03b1-mannobiose and maltose have been reported [15,16,17]. When interacting with oligosaccharides, it has been shown that GRFT preferentially interacts with the terminal sugar [16]. Crystals with mannose have shown that all binding sites are almost identical and each one contains an aspartic acid (Asp) residue that makes extensive contacts with the sugar. These include Asp30, Asp70 and Asp112 that make hydrogen bonding interactions with O5 and O6 of mannose [15] (Figure 1C). Mutations of these residues to Ala do not affect the folding of the protein but weaken the binding to a mannose column [18].",

This problem was solved by Moulaei et al. who were able to create a monomeric version of GRFT (mGRFT) by insertion of a short linker, Gly-Ser, that separates the \u03b2-strands that undergo intermolecular domain swapping [19]. A second mutation, leucine in position 2 to serine, was introduced to minimize the hydrophobic patch opposite to the swap region. A complex of mGRFT bound to a synthetic nonamannoside (Man9) that contains the nine mannose residues present in full-length mannonanose-di-(N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) (Man9GlcNAc2) but lacks the core. In that structure, they found two of the three arms of nonamannoside bound to two of the three mannose-binding sites (Figure 2). In particular, the terminal mannose units on the D2 and D1 arms were bound to sites 1 and 3 (as defined in ref [15]), respectively [19]. The third mannose-binding site, site 2, is occupied by the D2 arm of another nonamannoside in what likely is a more transient interaction [19]. This interaction was inconsistent with the model proposed by Zi\u00f3kowska et al. [16] where it was proposed that all three arms of Man9GlcNAc2 could interact with GRFT with a one-to-one stoichiometry. In addition to the crystal structures, NMR assignments for the backbone atoms of GRFT in the absence of ligand and in the presence of mannose have been reported [18].",

Single mutations of any one of the Asp residues to Ala slightly weaken the affinity of binding to HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. However, the single mutations significantly decrease the potency in inhibition in single round HIV infection and cytopathicity assays as well as cell-to-cell transmission assays (cocultivation assays) [18,20]. To further study the importance of having three binding sites on each monomer, Xue et al. [21] designed a series of mutants where two monomers connected by an amino acid linker were expressed to form an obligate dimer. They compared a construct having all six binding sites (three from each monomer), with a mutant where three of the binding sites in one of the subunits were mutated to abolish binding to mannose (one-arm obligate dimer) and another mutant in which all six mannose binding sites were mutated. Binding studies showed that the obligate dimer as well as the construct containing mannose binding sites on only one subunit bound to gp120 with comparable affinities, whereas the mutant lacking all mannose binding sites did not bind gp120. In contrast, neutralization assays showed that the anti-HIV activity of the one-arm obligate dimer was reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to the wild-type obligate dimer [21].",

Interestingly, nonamannoside binding was largely enthalpically driven and entropically unfavorable, indicating the formation of more favorable contacts between the sugar and the protein.

Crystal structures with a synthetic nonamannoside have been obtained only for the monomeric GRFT construct. The mode of binding seen in the crystals was in disagreement with a model proposing all three terminal mannose units of Man9 interacting with each of the mannose-binding sites in GRFT [16,19]. The inability of Man9 to engage all three binding sites on GRFT was further supported by studies that showed that glycopeptides that mimic Man9 required distances greater than those separating the arms of natural Man9GlcNAc2 in order to engage all three binding sites simultaneously [26]. Most recently, cryo-electron microscopy and surface plasmon resonance studies of viral particles treated with GRFT or GRFT mutants demonstrated that the unique combination of multivalency, strict recognition of Man9 and homodimeric structure of GRFT led to bridging of viral particles and aggregation [27].",

These include the conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) 48d that binds to the CD4-induced epitope on gp120, and the carbohydrate-specific mAb 2G12 [9,36]. Interestingly, binding of the lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) to gp120 was shown to inhibit subsequent binding of GRFT; in contrast, GRFT binding to gp120 does not block subsequent binding by CV-N [9]. This could suggest that GRFT has a smaller recognition epitope, or lower stoichiometry of binding compared to CV-N. However, ITC experiments showed that a total of approximately 10 GRFT units are capable of binding to a single gp120 glycoprotein [30]. In regard to timing of inhibition, GRFT has been shown to initiate antiviral activity immediately upon contact with HIV-1. This represents an advantage when compared with other antiretroviral agents, such as the nucleoside phosphonate (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA) that must be administered as a prodrug ester [28].",

CD4-IgG2 is fusion protein used as a surrogate of CD4 where the variable region of an IgG2 molecule has been replaced with the soluble region of the CD4 receptor. Deletion of the glycan in position 386 decreases the GRFT-mediated increase in b12 binding [39].

DCs also play an important role in viral transmission. DC cells present a DC-SIGN (dendritic cell intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM-3) grabbing non-integrin) receptor on their surface. DCs migrate to the lymph nodes where the DC-SIGN receptor mediates the transmission to na\u00efve uninfected CD4+ T cells. It is believed that the interaction of HIV-1 with dendritic cells through the DC-SIGN receptor mediates the transfer of HIV-1 to the lymph nodes where it infects CD4+ T cells. The DC-SIGN mediated transfer of HIV to target cells involves binding of the virus to the DC-SIGN receptor, a process that occurs through interactions between high-mannose glycans on the surface of the envelope glycoprotein with DC-SIGN, followed by transfer to CD4+ target cells for infection. GRFT has been shown to inhibit both processes [37,41]. In addition, single-site mutations on the mannose-binding site of GRFT have been shown to significantly diminish DC-SIGN associated cell-to-cell transmission [20]. Competition assays have shown that GRFT inhibits the binding of DC-SIGN to gp120 [20,40]. GRFT is not cytotoxic to DCs and does not trigger DC apoptosis or maturation [42].",

Not surprisingly, one strategy used by HIV against all lectins as well as glycan-targeting mAbs involves deletion of glycosylation sites (Figure 4). Alexandre et al. performed an extensive analysis comparing the IC50 values of observed for GRFT against numerous HIV-1 subtype A and B strains, with the glycosylation of naturally-occurring viruses [36]. Their results showed that viruses missing glycosylation at both Asn 234 and 295 sites were ~20\u2013100\u00d7 less sensitive to GRFT. However, the absence of just one of these glycosylation sites did not affect the sensitivity. In addition, the number of missing glycans did not correlate with sensitivity to GRFT, but the location of glycosylation sites had a clear effect on efficacy. Huang et al. [43] on the other hand investigated the role of glycans at Asn 295 and 448 in the background of a subtype C HIV strain MWS2. Mutants with a single deletion in either of these two glycosylation sites showed decreased susceptibility to GRFT (20\u2013100\u00d7 less sensitive), and double mutants showed an even more pronounced decrease in GRFT sensitivity. In a different study, strains lacking the glycan in position 295 showed lower sensitivity to GRFT and strains missing glycans 234 and 295 significantly reduced sensitivity [21].",

Insertion and deletion of amino acids near the glycosylation sites in the V4 loop of gp120 that would be expected to alter glycosylation were also observed [45]. Importantly, when natural resistance evolves, these studies and others suggest that multiple glycosylation site mutations are required for a virus to become resistant to GRFT, and the level of resistance is only 3\u201310 fold compared to the wild type [45]. In another study examining the effect of a different lectin, Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA), GRFT-resistant HIV-1 IIIB strains were generated and resulted in deletions of glycans in positions 230, 234, 295 386 and 448, and these multiple mutations decreased GRFT susceptibility by more than 10,000 fold [46].

Synergy is more pronounced for some lectin resistant HIV-1 strains [29]. BanLec has also shown to have additive effects with GRFT in cell-to-cell transmission assays [37]. Interestingly, GRFT showed additive effects with OAA whereas it showed antagonism with the lectin hybrid OAA-homologous protein (OPA) [46]. As with the synergy studies employing GRFT and HIV-neutralizing antibodies, the type of assay may play a role in the observed outcome.",

This has important clinical relevance because, following liver transplantation in HCV-infected patients, reinfection of the new liver graft commonly occurs [31,32]. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that GRFT interacted with the envelope glycoprotein E1E2, and prevented subsequent interaction with one HCV receptor, CD81 [31]. In contrast, ELISA experiments showed that GRFT did not inhibit the binding of E2 to CD81 [32]. The infectivity is significantly inhibited by nonamannoside, indicating that like in the case of HIV, GRFT interacts with the high-mannose glycans on the surface of HCV [31]. GRFT treatment in chimeric mice with livers engrafted with functional primary human hepatocytes showed significantly lower virus titers when compared with treatment with a GRFT mutant where the binding sites have been mutated to prevent binding to glycans [31,32]. Even though mutations occurred upon exposure of HCV to GRFT, attempts to generate resistance against GRFT failed to detect specific envelope mutations that conferred resistance to the lectin [49].",

GRFT binds glycans on the surface of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein S (S). A total of three molecules of GRFT are capable of binding the S in a dose dependent manner with very high affinity, a lower number when compared with HIV-gp120 probably due to the lower number of high-mannose glycans on the surface of S.

While GRFT is by now well known to prevent infection by a number of diverse viruses, there has been no sign of cellular toxicity against a variety of cells even at concentrations as high as 500 nM [28]. If used as an antiviral therapeutic, the mode of GRFT administration may be determined by the mechanism through which the virus infects new hosts. For example, in the case of HIV, its most promising application is as a topical microbicide. Microbicides do not carry substantial risk of systemic side effects because they are unlikely to be absorbed efficiently. Alternatively, in respiratory infections via SARS-CoV, GRFT could be administered as an intranasal spray, or intravenously in the case of HCV.",

GRFT binds the outermost layer of the squamous epithelium (human cervical epithelium) [53]. However, no loss in cell viability of endocervical and ectocervical cell lines was observed even at doses of 1 mg/mL GRFT. In addition, GRFT does not induce cell proliferation in cervicovaginal cell lines in contrast with other lectins that show high cytotoxicity and significant mitogenic activity [53]. Treatment of human cervical explants as well as cultured human endocervical, ectocervical and vaginal cell lines with GRFT, or intravaginal GRFT treatment of rabbits, have shown no significant perturbations on the levels of cytokines and chemokines [11,53]. RNA microarray analysis of cultured ectocervical cells line showed that GRFT treatment has minimal alteration in the gene expression profile [53]. An in vivo rabbit vaginal irritation (RVI) assay showed good safety profiles for GRFT, with no inflammatory responses or damage to epithelia. RVI testing is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to proceed for clinical testing [11].",

Subcutaneous injection of GRFT in immunodeficient transgenic mice indicated that the lectin remained bioavailable even after 18 days, with only mild transient alterations in health parameters such as body weight and morbidity scores. However, prolonged dosing had deleterious effects on the overall health of these mice [32]. The authors of this study suggest that this could be a consequence of the inherent fragility of the mouse model and not toxicity to implanted human hepatocytes [32]. Treatment of HCV-challenged transgenic mice showed a 2.5 log reduction in the HCV viral titer for the GRFT-treated mice [32]. In another HCV animal model, subcutaneous injections into chimeric mice harboring human hepatocytes in their livers resulted in two out of six animal deaths; similar to the previous study, the authors suggest that this is likely due to the fragile nature of the mice used in this model rather than lectin-induced toxicity [31]. Lastly, intraperitoneal administration of GRFT to mice before a lethal dose of JEV resulted in 100% survival whereas none of the mice in the control group survived [33].",

Even though GRFT has three mannose binding sites on each subunit, it has been shown that only two of them can be simultaneously engaged by the Man9 oligosaccharide, leaving the third binding site available for binding a second Man9 molecule.
