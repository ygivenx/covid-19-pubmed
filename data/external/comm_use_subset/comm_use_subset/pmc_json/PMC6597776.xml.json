Within several weeks of its first identification within and around a construction site in the southeast of the country, the outbreak had spread to multiple secondary loci across many parts of the island [8]. Over the next month, there were approximately 100 confirmed cases a week, of the same order of magnitude as the four serotypes of dengue [15]. Like the dengue viruses, Zika is transmitted primarily by Ae. aegypti, and in consequence, there was, and remains, the potential that the ZIKV could become similarly endemic. Autochthonous ZIKV transmission is concerning, because of the risk of severe complications including Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome and microcephaly [16\u201318], which, although not reported to date in relation with ZIKV infection in Singapore, makes successful control imperative.",

Despite the ongoing baseline vector control programme that targets Aedes mosquitoes in residential areas, the outbreak demonstrates the possibility that human movement may allow the virus to break the \u2018cordon\u2019 of vector control and lead to cross-island transmission. In contrast to dengue, which has been endemic in Singapore since at least the 1960s [10,19], the 2016 Zika outbreak spread from one initial locus and across a population that has heretofore not experienced recorded Zika outbreaks; like dengue, it is expected that there be relatively little seasonal forcing on transmission risk [20].

To this end, we used spatio-temporal models built using Bayesian methods to comprehensively analyse the autochthonous spread of Zika, exploiting the home and work addresses and date of symptom onset of 323 Zika-confirmed cases. To quantify the role of workplaces to the transmission of ZIKV, we explored the space of possible infection trees (i.e. who-infected-whom-where) to infer how much infection, and how much transmission, occurs around the home and workplace of cases. This may provide valuable information to guide vector control efforts for future outbreaks both in Singapore and elsewhere.",

There are three main modes of public transportation in Singapore: the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), the Light Rail Transit (LRT) and public buses. To pay the public transport fares, most commuters use an EZ-link contactless card: a smart card that is read when entering or leaving the MRT or LRT network or when boarding or alighting a bus. Using data on all users of EZ-link cards over one month from the Land Transport Authority of Singapore, which captures the time and location of commuters' intersecting with the public transport system, we identified individuals who visited within a 1 km square centered on the initial focus, and for each inferred a plausible home address and a plausible work address too using the algorithm described in the electronic supplementary materials. We then discarded those with neither an inferred home nor work address within that 1 km square and summarized the distribution of distances between the addresses of those remaining.",

The location where the individual is infected is unobserved and may often be their home or other places they spend significant amounts of time, such as their place of work. In addition, there is very little information available on those individuals who escape infection altogether. Calculating the likelihood of the parameters becomes challenging without knowing the extra information. To address this uncertainty, we developed a Bayesian data augmentation framework which considers the source of infection as augmented data or nuisance parameters [23\u201325]. In this analysis, the parameter space includes the unknown nature, location and time of infection. Flat prior distributions were assumed for all parameters (details in the electronic supplementary materials).",

The probability that i is the individual infecting j is:Pr(Ij=i)=hij\u2211k:tk<tj\u2061hkj,where the time dependence of hij is suppressed for brevity and tk is the day that individual k had the onset of symptoms. The hazard of infection is assumed to be additive across sources and multiplicative in time and space and, hence, the hazard can be written in terms of the following spatial and temporal kernels:hij\u221dfT(tj\u2212ti)[ fD\u2225Hi, Hj\u2225+ fD\u2225Hi,Wj\u2225+ fD\u2225Wi,Hj\u2225+ fD\u2225Wi,Wj\u2225],where fT(\u03b4)=1/\u03b4\u03c32\u03c0exp\u2061{\u2212((log\u2061(\u03b4)\u2212\u03bc)2)/(2\u03c32)} (for \u03b4 > 0 and 0 otherwise) is a time and fD(d) = \u03bbexp(\u2212\u03bbd) a spatial kernel representing host and mosquito movement (for space) and incubation (for time). It is worth noting that the temporal kernel represents the convolution of extrinsic and intrinsic incubation, and these are not inferred or modelled separately. We assume that the hazard for the time between infections is proportional to the lognormal density with mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3 on the log scale, set to be consistent with the 10\u201323 days serial interval range for Zika fever [26] as there was insufficient information to directly estimate the temporal kernel from the data. Three fixed temporal density were considered: lognormal(12,3), lognormal(14,3) and lognormal(16,3); in addition a distribution with free parameters, lognormal(\u03bc,\u03c3), was also considered. We assume that the distances between infections have kernels proportional to the exponential density with rate \u03bb estimated from the data. In this model, ti is time i had onset of symptoms, Hi and Wi are coordinates of i's home and workplace addresses, respectively. The individual can be infected at home or work and can infect others near his or her home or workplace. Lj \u2208 {Hj, Wj} is the vicinity individual j was infected at and Sj\u2208{HIj,WIj} the vicinity Ij infects j. Here, we also defined \u2225LIj,Sj\u2225 to be the host generation distance, namely the distance from where Ij was infected to the location closest to where s/he infected j, and \u2225Sj,Lj \u2225 to be vector generation distance, namely the distance from the location Ij exposed j at to where j was infected.

Using the deviance information criterion (DIC) [23], we chose the model variant that best fits the data.

These posterior density maps aggregate cases located close to each other in space, thereby providing a fairer depiction of the uncertainty in infection locations than an individual-based metric. The posterior distribution of the CDF for the distance between where the inferred donor was inferred to have infected the recipient and where the recipient was inferred to have been infected was derived by calculating the empirical CDF for each iteration of the algorithm and aggregating over iterations to obtain the posterior mean and an equal-tailed 95% credible interval.

These spatial figures also demonstrate that for most cases, the source of infection can be inferred to a relatively limited set of potential foci. The fraction of infections attributable to transmission events at each combination of the donor's and the recipient's home and work was consistent across the parameters considered for the temporal kernel (electronic supplementary materials). In the early phase of the outbreak, most infections were estimated to have occurred near the case's workplace, with approximately equal numbers of infections at home and at work in the second half of the outbreak (electronic supplementary materials). These results were robust to the temporal kernel considered. The posterior CDF between infections is presented in the electronic supplementary materials for different temporal kernels and the model variants in which transmission is allowed to occur only near homes or only near workplaces.

The method presented in this paper is an extension of the transmission tree reconstruction methods as described by Wallinga & Teunis [31] that extends their temporal kernel, represented by fT(\u03b4) in our paper, to account for space, through a spatial kernel fD(d), and by considering two main location types for each case, namely their home and workplace. Although the locations of cases by themselves make a convincing case for the role of humans as a \u2018vector\u2019 transmitting the virus to naive regions of the city, this extension to the Wallinga and Teunis method allows the degree of such long-distance spread, and the importance of the workplace in transmission, to possibly be quantified.

Across all the models presented, the proportion of infections occurring around workplaces was substantial. The results represented in figure 5b,c provide some empirical evidence that the national vector control programme should consider both types of location (home and workplaces) when defining clusters for interventions. As a substantial proportion of infection occurs at workplaces, control measures targeted at residential regions of the city-state may be ineffective to contain the spread of an arbovirus outbreak. In the past, vector control measures concentrated on residential areas, although the national vector control programme now considers both types of location in defining clusters for interventions. Substantial amounts of infection occurring at workplaces will make a control programme that focuses on the home less effective, and as a result, the method developed in this study may potentially better inform vector control measures. Given the endemicity of dengue in Singapore, it would be of some interest to investigate the degree to which dengue infections occur away from the home, especially in the light of previous research which showed infection risk varying over a weekly cycle [33].",

Neither the exact location nor the time of infection of the cases was known, and to overcome this, we used the residential and workplace addresses and date of symptom onset as proxies of place and time of infection. Transmission in the neighbourhood of the home or workplace is implicitly captured through the dispersal kernel, but it is a limitation that other locations frequented by cases (such as eating houses or places of worship [34]) could not be recorded. Owing to the non-negligible asymptomatic rate of ZIKV infections, we may have incomplete information on potentially infectious individuals despite the good surveillance system in Singapore. A previous analysis of this outbreak sought to infer the phylogeny of a fraction of the cases, but the low mutation rate led to a lack of variation in the genetic data [8], and as such, the epidemiological data provide greater information on the transmission dynamics. Over a longer time period, more mutations would be expected, and a marriage of field and molecular epidemiological information may be warranted for a longer outbreak [35\u201337]. Cross-immunological effects have been demonstrated [38,39] between dengue and zika, and it is not clear what effects this might have had on transmission potential in Singapore, given the high prevalence of dengue. In initial model building, we sought to specify non-informative priors for the parameters of the temporal kernel, but there was insufficient information to allow these to be estimated together with the other estimands. We therefore set biologically plausible values of these parameters and assessed the sensitivity of the results to the values chosen. The main findings\u2014in particular, the role of workplaces in transmission and the inferred locations of infection\u2014were robust to this choice.",

Incorporating spatial data in the model allows us to study the geographical-related exposures for these vector-borne diseases. Singapore's outbreak appears qualitatively different from those in less urbanized environments [40\u201342], in that infected Aedes mosquitoes played a less significant role in the long-distance transmission of Zika than did ambulant cases, which may have implications for control of subsequent arbovirus outbreaks in urban settings like Singapore.",
