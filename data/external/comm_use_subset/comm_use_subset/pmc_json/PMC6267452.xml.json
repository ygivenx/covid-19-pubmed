However, breeding for disease resistance and/or heat tolerance can be difficult due to the need for specific challenge facilities, the potential terminal nature of these traits, animal welfare concerns, biosafety concerns, and cost. The identification of genetic factors influencing disease resistance and/or heat tolerance would provide tools for improvement through selective breeding. The response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is known to be partly under genetic control [5,6,7,8,9]. Several scientists have reported differences in heat response between lines and breeds [10,11,12]. In this study, we identify genes and haplotype combinations within those genes that affect the response to NDV and/or heat challenge. Producing chickens that are genetically predisposed to perform better in the face of disease, vaccination, or environmental challenges (which often occur simultaneously in resource-limited settings) will ultimately lead to improved food and nutritional security and enhanced livelihoods in low-income countries with eventual global impacts.",

Membrane receptors functioning in immune response (MHC, IL18R1, IL1R1, IFRD1) are responsible for recognizing foreign molecules. This recognition of antigens is crucial for immune function. IFRD1 also has a role in muscle growth and differentiation [25]. Components of the innate immune system (AP2A2, TLR3, TLR7, TOLLIP, MX, IFI27L2) provide a first line of defense to a pathogen or virus. TLR3, TLR7, and MX have been directly implicated in antiviral response [13,21,26]. TOLLIP is part of the toll like receptor signaling pathway [27]. AP2A2 is suggested to function in endocytosis, recognition, and processing of antigens [28]. IFI27L2 functions in the apoptotic pathway [29].",

Birds were provided ad libitum access to feed and water throughout the study period and were reared following standard commercial husbandry practices. Initially, 23 h of light was provided, which was gradually decreased to 13.5 h of light by day 29. The birds were reared at thermo-neutral temperature (until day 14 in the heat + NDV group). In each of the three replicates (hatches), half (180) of the chicks were ground transported from Hy-Line International in Dallas Center, IA, USA to a BSL-2 facility in Ames, IA, USA for a pathogen challenge, and the other half (180) were shipped by air the same day to a BSL-2 facility in Davis, California, USA for a thermal and pathogen challenge. The families (sibs) were distributed as evenly as possible using known dam information across the two treatment groups (NDV and heat + NDV).

The chicks in the NDV treatment group were challenged with NDV. The chicks in the heat + NDV treatment group were subjected to the same NDV challenge with the addition of a heat challenge that was initiated before the NDV challenge and continued throughout the study. The experimental timeline for both of the treatment groups is depicted in Figure 1. High ambient temperature was included in the experimental protocol for the heat + NDV treatment group. Until day 14, the chicks were reared at thermo-neutral temperature and 60% humidity. At 14 days of age, the temperature was increased to 35 \u00b0C and was held until the conclusion of the trial (25 \u00b0C in the non-heated group). The optimum temperature for adult laying hens is 19\u201322 \u00b0C, with temperatures above this range resulting in heat stress [33]. For both treatment groups, at 21 days of age (0 dpi), the birds were inoculated with 108 of 50% embryonic infectious dose (EID50) of live attenuated type B1 LaSota strain Newcastle disease vaccine in a volume of 200 \u03bcL. Virus propagation was detailed previously by Deist et al. [34]. The virus was administered via a natural, ocular-nasal route. Each eye and nares received ~50 \u03bcL of inoculum. The ND viral load was quantified at 20, 23, and 27 days of age and was thereafter designated as pre-challenge, 2 dpi, and 6 dpi, respectively. Anti-NDV antibody levels were measured on day 31 and were hereafter referred to as 10 dpi. Body weights were recorded on days 0, 21, and 31 of age. Previously, two distinct genome wide association studies (GWAS) (NDV and heat + NDV) associated 600 k genotypes from these birds with the NDV viral load, anti-NDV antibody, and growth rate phenotypes described herein [35,36].",

Room and replicate were treated as distinct between treatments so that the RR effect captured treatment effects as well. Random effects included animal genetic effects (A) with a genomic relationship matrix that were computed using genotypes of 338,814 quality-controlled SNPs from the 600 K SNP panel [35,36] for 946 animals following the procedure described by [43], and residuals (e). The random effect of dam was included for pre-challenge measurements of growth rate. Phenotypic variance was obtained by summing estimates of variance due to animal, residual, and dam (where applicable). Heritability was calculated as a ratio of the estimates of animal to phenotypic variance. Genetic correlations between traits that were measured in both the treatment groups were also estimated with a bivariate animal model in ASReml 4 fitting the same effects as described above.",

Significant effects were identified for the SLC5A1 haplotype pair combination in the NDV treatment group as well as in the combined data set (Table 3). Solute carrier family 5 member 1 (SLC5A1) functions as a sodium/glucose cotransporter [51]. The implication of SLC5A1 with viral load is novel. Expression of SLC5A1 has been shown to be affected by hyperthermic conditions [52,53]. The shared significance and direction of the effect between the NDV challenge alone and the NDV challenge under heat, along with a lack of significance in the heat + NDV group and a lack of significant haplotype by treatment interaction, indicates the robustness of the role SLC5A1 is playing in response to NDV.",

The effects of IFRD1 haplotype combination and of IFRD1_H01 copy number were significant in the NDV group. Interferon related developmental regulator 1 (IFRD1) functions in muscle growth and differentiation [25] and, importantly for laying hens, in the balance of bone formation and resorption [54]. Many quantitative trait loci that are associated with growth, body weight, and fat accumulation have been reported in the location of IFRD1 [55]. IFRD1 exhibits lower expression in the trachea and Harderian gland of Fayoumi (resistant) chickens compared to Leghorn (susceptible) chickens after NDV infection [26,34]. The Fayoumi and Leghorn chickens are inbred research lines representing resistant and susceptible models, respectively. Our finding of a significant effect of IFRD1 haplotype on growth rate is in agreement with previous findings. The additional implication of IFRD1 in bone formation and resorption is particularly relevant since the population studied was a commercial laying hen line. HSPA2 haplotype combination effect on growth rate post-NDV challenge was significant in the combined data and in the heat + NDV group. Heat shock 70 kDa protein (HSPA2) functions as a chaperone and assists in protein folding during exposure to heat or other stresses [56]. HSPA2 has also been implicated in antigen binding and presentation [57]. These two previously identified roles for HSPA2 contribute to its effect, presented here, on growth rate post NDV challenge. Under heat challenge conditions, growth during the NDV challenge is impacted by HSPA2. Under thermoneutral conditions, growth during the NDV challenge is impacted by IFRD1. The interaction of the IFRD1 haplotype combination with the treatment group was the only significant haplotype by treatment group interaction (adjusted p < 0.1, data not shown). This difference in gene effects between the two treatment groups highlights the potential impact of hypothermic challenge on response to disease.",

Both studies identified multiple SNPs that met a suggestive (20%) genomewide threshold. For antibody at 10 dpi, one QTL was identified in each treatment group (NDV: chr 21, heat + NDV: chr 1). For viral load at 2 dpi, one QTL on chromosome 1 was identified in the heat + NDV group (none in the NDV group). For viral load at 6 dpi, one QTL was identified in each treatment group, on chromosome 4 in the NDV group and on chromosome 24 in the heat + NDV group. No overlap in the location of significance (SNPs or haplotypes) was seen between the GWAS and the results of the targeted genotyping that are presented here. Quite possibly, more variation linked to causative variants was captured in the targeted candidate gene genotyping than was captured in the 600k data, likely due to the much closer distance between SNPs that was used for the candidate gene analysis. Many more tests were performed in the GWAS than the candidate gene analysis that is presented here. Therefore, multiple test corrections would have been more stringent for the GWAS, creating the possibility that any potential shared effects (between GWAS and targeted genotyping) were considered non-significant in the GWAS results due to correction. The results of the two GWAS, combined with the results of the targeted genotyping analysis reported here, will enhance our understanding, providing a holistic view of response to infection under thermoneutral and heat stressed conditions.",

The multiple intermediary steps and factors that impact gene expression make it difficult to identify links between nucleotide variation and expression. In addition, little overlap exists in the genetic background of the lines that were used in all these studies (inbred vs. hybrid, research vs. commercial, etc.).

Pre-challenge (day 13) body weight was significantly different between the treatment groups (facilities). At this early phase of the experiment, the groups did not differ in terms of applied treatments. However, the birds in the group that were intended to receive the heat + NDV treatment did have a longer transport distance to their facility and, thus, a longer delay in initial access to feed and water and potentially additional transport stressors. Therefore, phenotypic differences that were measured in the later phases (viral load and antibody), which were confounded with treatment facility, may have been influenced to some extent by facility-specific environmental differences other than the applied treatments. However, the RR fixed effect accounted for differences between the groups (facilities), intentional and unintentional, in the statistical model.",
