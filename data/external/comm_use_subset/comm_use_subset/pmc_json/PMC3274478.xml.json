The majority of HEV epidemics in Asia, Africa and Latin America (Mexico) have been caused by genotype 1 and 2 [1]. In these endemic regions the virus is usually transmitted fecal-orally and spread through contamination of drinking water often related to flood and heavy rainfall [2]. However HEV is also endemic to industrialized countries of Europe, Asia and the U.S., where the number of sporadic cases of hepatitis E of genotype 3 and 4 has increased in recent years [3]. While genotypes 1 and 2 seem to be restricted to humans, genotypes 3 and 4 have a high prevalence in pig populations world-wide. Hepatitis E is now regarded as a zoonotic disease and pigs and most likely other animal species are reservoirs [4]. In addition to genotypes 1-4, novel genotypes have been detected in wild boars from Japan [5] and in rats from Germany [6].",

ORF1 comprises several putative functional domains [12] (Figure 1): A methyltransferase (Met) with subsequent Y domain; a papain-like cysteine protease (Plp), which over a proline-rich variable (V) region is connected to the so-called X domain; a helicase (Hel) and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 encodes for the viral capsid protein, which contains dominant antigenic determinants [13] and neutralizing epitopes [14]. ORF 3 encodes a small phosphoprotein [15] of controversially discussed function that seems to be essential for in vivo infectivity [16,17].",

For this purpose, fifteen potentially immunogenic HEV antigens of ORFs 1, 2 and 3 were recombinatorially cloned into bacterial expression vectors of which nine were subsequently expressed and purified. Their immunogenicity was evaluated with pre-characterized blood samples on a microarray format in comparison to seven recombinant antigens already in use in a commercially available anti-HEV diagnostic test-system. Analyzed data show that seven of those nine HEV proteins were putative serologic markers of HEV infections. Statistical analysis of measured signal intensities could confirm well known epitopes, identify immunogenic subdomains and characterize newly described antigens and their possible suitability in commercial assay formats.",

Arrays were incubated with 2 ml diluted serum (1:40 in recomDot buffer, Mikrogen, Germany), washed with recomDot washing buffer (Mikrogen, Germany) and for detection of specifically bound antibodies with anti-human IgG- and anti-human IgM-peroxidase labeled conjugates (Seramun, Germany). Visualization of immune complexes was achieved by tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Seramun, Germany). After automated scanning, the quantification of specific signals was performed by digitalization of grey tones with the recomDot Scan software (recomDot system, Mikrogen, Germany).",

Consequently, the removal of one of these two antigens would change the explanatory value of the assay significantly. Similar, when choosing only from the seven \"Mikrogen antigens\" the same method discontinued with O2NGT1 and O2CGT3. Comparing both antigen combinations, binary regression analysis showed that there is no statistically significant difference between both combinations. In IgM detection a similar result was obtained: Choosing from 16 antigens the backwards method reveals V, O2CGT3 and O3GT3 to be the best combination. If restricted to the seven \"Mikrogen antigens\" only, O2NGT3 was set instead of V, but binary regression analysis could not determine any statistically significant difference between both antigen combinations. Further calculation of a forward binary regression method used to obtain the best antigen combination choosing from all 16 antigens resulted in O2CGT3 in combination with O2NGT1 for IgG detection. This means that the addition of any other antigen would not increase the explanatory value of the assay consisting of these two antigens.

The sequence of the potential ORF1 antigen was determined by the probably most native structure namely defined functional domains. Other studies of putative ORF1 epitopes are based on computer analysis of hydrophobicity and secondary structure [18,20] or overlapping decamers [19]. A common disadvantage of these artificially predicted epitopes is the presence of only linear epitopes and therefore conformational antigens might be missed [19]. ORF1 epitopes found in earlier studies were within the regions of Met [18,19], Plp [19], V [19], \u00d7 [18,19], Hel [19], Rdrp [18-20]. According to Zhao et al. the major antigenic epitopes of HEV are located in the ORF2 and ORF3. Four ORF1 antigens were excluded early in the study after initial experiments showed inadequate immunoreactivities of ORF1 antigens [18]. Kaur et al. used two serum pools to screen for reactive ORF1 polypeptides but did not investigate the diagnostic impact with sensitivity and specificity levels of the distinct ORF1 proteins [19]. Overall these data revealed that the diagnostic impact of ORF1 antigens is low. Only Qi et al. could show that the inclusion of an Rdrp epitope in a serologic assay increases the test performance for an unknown reason but did not focus on the performance of other ORF1 epitopes [19]. In our study we also calculated if the additional presence of an ORF1 antigen could complement ORF2 and ORF3 antigens in a diagnostic test. It became clear that the two ORF1 antigens included in the diagnostic test according to backwards regression analysis (Y in IgG detection and V in IgM detection) could be exchanged by antigens already used in commercially test without significant change of the diagnostic performance.",

It is well known that immunogenicity of ORF3 is also determined by the C-terminus [29]. Our data confirm that the N-terminus of ORF3 is not suitable for detection of IgG and IgM antibodies. In contrast the reactivity of the C-terminus correlates very well with the full length ORF3 protein and showed an even better AUC in ROC analysis. A differentiated view on N- and C-terminal parts of ORF3 seems to play an important role not only in serologic diagnostics but also in the newly postulated involvement of ORF3 in viral egress [17,27,30]. For ORF3 the prediction of a transmembrane domain was included in our study to optimize mimicry of naturally occurring antigen conformations and probably explains the predominant seroreactivity of the C-terminal subdomain. Of course this hypothetic secondary structure needs to be confirmed in additional molecular studies. In general the finding of different seroreactivities of morphologic ORF3 subdomains supports the approach to investigate functional ORF1 subdomains separately.",

Comparison of measured signal intensities of genotype 1 and genotype 3 antigens with defined patient sera indicate that there might be a genotype specific reactivity of ORF2 antigens.

The most potent HEV antigen of the independent systematic screen was found to be the same epitope as the in literature and commercial tests well established C-terminal ORF2 protein. Additionally ORF3 C-terminus is able to compete with antigens used in a commercial test. Summarizing all results obtained from our experiments we conclude that existing commercial HEV assays seem to measure HEV prevalence properly which is based on the high correlation of seroreactivities of homologous antigens. Furthermore we remark that our systematic approach for serum profiling experiments can be used to screen the majority of a complete HEV library for novel antigens. Finally different antigen genotypes could possibly be used to serologically differentiate between genotype 1 and genotype 3 infections and therefore serve as a useful tool to obtain insight into etiological and epidemiological questions of HEV disease.",
