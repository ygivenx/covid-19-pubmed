            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5' cap and a 3' polyadenylated tail. The size of its genome is approximately 28 Kb [1]. The genome comprises a 5' untranslated region (UTR); a 3' UTR; at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); and three non-structural proteins, namely, replicases 1a and 1ab as well as ORF3 [2]. The PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein composed of 1,383 amino acids (aa). Similar to other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface and contains four neutralizing epitopes (499\u2013638, 748\u2013755, 764\u2013771, and 1,368\u20131,374 aa) [3,4,5]. The PEDV S protein has a pivotal function in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry [6]. Thus, the S glycoprotein is a primary target for the development of vaccines against PEDV. The S glycoprotein is also the major envelope glycoprotein of the virion, which serves as an important viral component to understand the genetic relationships of different PEDV strains and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field [2,7,8,9].",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating swine disease that is characterized by acute enteritis and lethal watery diarrhea, followed by dehydration frequently leading to high mortality in piglets [10,11]. PED was first observed among English fattening pigs in 1971 [10] but has increasingly become a problem in several Asian countries, including Korea [12], China [8,9,13], Japan [14], and Thailand [15]. In China, PEDV was first isolated in 1973 [9]. Almost two decades later, its prevalence has become a problem of the swine industry in China, but until 2010, the prevalence of PEDV infection was relatively low with only sporadic outbreaks. However, in late 2010, a remarkable increase in PED outbreaks occurred in the pig-producing provinces [9,16]. PED that occurred in several porcine farms and caused severe economic loss between January 2012 and March 2012 in Gansu Province, China was investigated in this study. The affected pigs exhibited watery diarrhea, dehydration, and thin-walled intestines. The disease progressed to death within four days. Pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited diarrhea and loss of appetite with different degrees of severity, which were determined to be age dependent. Among the suckling piglets, 100% became ill. Pigs >7 days of age experienced mild diarrhea and anorexia, which completely resolved within a few days. To identify the PEDV strain(s) responsible for the recent outbreak in Gansu, where located in west China, the east by Shanxi province, the south of Sichuan province, the west of Xinjiang province, and the north of Inner Mongolia province, we sequenced the full-length S gene of the isolates obtained from the diarrhea samples collected from pigs in two affected pig farms. One farm named Yongjing Tai Chi Breed Co., Ltd (Yongjing, China), and another named Hoggery of Science and Technology Breed Park of Jiugang Hongfeng Company (Jiayuguan, China).",

The S protein of JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, and YJ3F contained 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated (Figure 1A,B). The S protein of the YJ7C strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 23 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated (Figure 1C). However, the S protein of the CV777 vaccine strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated (Figure 1D). For JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, and YJ3F, four (from N to V at 57, from N to I at 127, from T to I at 232, and from N to S at 719) of the changes in the predicted amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites, whereas another three changes (from S to N at 58, from I to T at 116, and from T to N at 1193) created three new glycosylation sites compared with the vaccine strain CV777 (Figure 2).

The changes in the N-linked glycosylation sites between the Gansu PEDV strains from our study and the vaccine strain may influence their pathogenicity and antigenicity and should be researched in the future.

Group 2 comprised three strains from South Korea (KNU-0801, KNU-0901, and Chinju 99) and two strains from Japan (NK and KH). Subgroup 3-1 comprised five strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C), three strains (CH1, CH8, CHGD-01) that were identified from China in 2011 and four strains from South Korea KNU-0802, KNU-0902, KNU-0903, and KNU-0905).

Our results indicate that the North Chinese PEDV strains from our study had a close relationship with the South Korean strains and mapped phylogenetically to the same branch. However, they differed genetically from the European strains (including the vaccine strain CV777) and the early domestic strains. Similar to the result by Li et al. [9], the appearance of strains from China similar to those from South Korea and their function in the recent PED outbreak in South China, should be further investigated.",

Similar to other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface, with a pivotal function in stimulating induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host. Thus, the S glycoprotein is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV.

The sequence insertions and deletions in the S gene and mutations in the antigenic regions found in variant strains possibly provided stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants that influenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine, ultimately causing the 2012 outbreak of severe diarrhea in the porcine farms of Gansu Province, China.
