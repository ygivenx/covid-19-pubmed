These secondary metabolites have developed as resources of natural drugs because of their biological activities. Many others have become commercially important and notably beneficial in the treatment of human diseases (Yu & De Luca, 2013). For example, galanthamine, which is extracted from the Lycoris plant, is one type of Amaryllidaceae alkaloid. As an inhibitor of cholinesterase, galanthamine can increase acetylcholine sensitivity and has a positive effect when treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Dal-Bianco et al., 1991). Other Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, such as lycorine and haemanthamine, have anti-cancer, anti-viral, and anti-bacterial properties. Lycorine might be a good candidate for therapeutic agent against leukemia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Li et al., 2015; Dosko\u010dil et al., 2015; Havelek et al., 2014). The officinal and economic values of Lycoris species remain uninvestigated.",

At the upstream of the galanthamine biosynthesis pathway, tyrosine, which is the origin beginning of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis is converted into tyramine by an undefined tyrosine decarboxylase (TYDC), which is the first committed step in isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis. TYDC is a common enzyme in plant kingdom (Lehmann & Pollmann, 2009), and also is implicated in the defense response (Facchini & De Luca, 1994). Then, tyramine and norbelladine 3,4-dihyroxybenzaldehyde are condensed to a Schiff-base (Eichhorn et al., 1998; Kilgore et al., 2014, Fig. 1), which is documented to be the basic bone of all Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (Barton et al., 1961). Norbelladine is then methylated by 4\u2032-O-methyltransferase (Np N4OMT) to 4\u2032-O-methylnorbelladine (Kilgore et al., 2014). One key phenol-coupling enzyme cytochrome P450, CYP96T1 from Narcissus sp. aff. Pseudonarcissus was identified to have C-C phenol coupling capacity to catalyze 4\u2032-O-methylnorbelladine to noroxomaritidine (Kilgore et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Jasmonate (JA) signal regulates plant response to many biotic and abiotic stresses by coordinating the production of abundant of defense-related protein and secondary metabolites (Turner, Ellis & Devoto, 2002; Wasternack, 2015). Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can induce three major classes of plant secondary metabolites (Wasternack, 2007; Wasternack & Hause, 2013). In our observation, under MeJA treatment, the accumulation of galanthamine is induced distinctly in other Lycoris plants (Mu et al., 2009); moreover, some specific genes correlated with secondary metabolism respond to MeJA signaling (Farmer & Ryan, 1992). MicroRNAs (miRNA) are commonly found in both plants and animals, these small regulatory RNAs with 20\u201324 nucleotides have been recognized for their participation in regulation mechanisms in plant growth, development and defense (Chen, 2009). As a post-transcriptional regulator, miRNAs in complex with Argonaute (AGO) effector protein, they cause target mRNA degradation through complementary region binding, while negatively modulating the expression of a wide range of genes. The plant miRNAs regulate their target mRNA by perfectly or near-perfectly complementary-matching (Axtell & Bowman, 2008; Chen, 2009); therefore, based on sequence complementarity, the target of the plant miRNAs can usually be successfully predicted (Sunkar & Zhu, 2004). It is predicted that miRNAs elicited by MeJA correlate with galanthamine biosynthesis via a possible post-transcriptional regulation (Xu et al., 2016). When investigating the role of miRNAs in the regulation of galanthamine biosynthesis in our earlier study, we observed and profiled L. aurea miRNA in response to treatment with MeJA. 154 miRNAs expressing differently in comparison to the vehicle-treated ones were identified (Xu et al., 2016). By using degradome sequencing analysis, 32 genes from different plant processes were validated, and were then targeted by 49 miRNAs. Among these miRNAs and targets, we found that LaTYDC1 was targeted by miR396. Of the conserved miRNAs in plants, miR396 regulates the expression level of transcriptional factors, such as GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR (GRF) and bHLH74, thereby affecting plant growth and development (Debernardi et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2015).",

LaTYDC1 expression in root, leaf and flower were 40, 10, and 15-fold greater, respectively, than that in bulb (Fig. 3B). At the beginning, six hours after 100 \u00b5M MeJA treatment, the accumulation of LaTYDC1 significantly increased almost 200 folds when compared with the vehicle control samples, and sharply decreased when compared with the expression level of samples 6 h after MeJA treatment. The similar results were observed after 24 h treatment (Fig. 3C).",

HPLC analysis was then carried out with the samples for the enzyme assay, in which the purified LaTYDC1 fusion protein uses tyrosine as substrate. The result shown in Fig. 4B demonstrated that the fusion LaTYDC1 was able to specifically catalyze the synthesis of tyramine, since the product with an identical peak in regards to retention time was the same as the corresponding tyramine standard (Fig. 4B). In addition, this product was determined by GC-MS analysis, and it was confirmed that the product is tyramine (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the optimal temperature for LaTYDC1 enzyme activity is 50 \u00b0C; when the temperature is below 30 \u00b0C or above 55 \u00b0C, enzyme activity rapidly declines (Fig. S2A). The optimum pH of LaTYDC1 is 8.5; when the pH value is above 9, enzyme activity sharply declines (Fig. S2B). Furthermore, the substrate affinity was determined by calculating the Km we used tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (Dopa) as the substrate for LaTYDC1. The Km for tyrosine is 602.34 \u00b1 38 \u00b5M, and the Km for dopa is 966.35 \u00b1 79 \u00b5M. The Vmax is 3.19 \u00b1 0.51 (nkat mg\u22121) and 1.24 \u00b1 0.095 (nkat mg\u22121), respectively (Table 1).",

MiRNAs play post-transcriptional regulatory roles in plants, and are involved in the regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis in many plants (Zhao et al., 2012). To identify the genes and miRNA that participate in the JA signal transduction pathway and are involved in galanthamine biosynthesis, we searched the response miRNA sequencing database of L. aurea (Xu et al., 2016). We identified that miR396 is responsive to MeJA treatment, and the predicted target is LaTYDC1. The cleavage site was confirmed by degradome data and is shown in Fig. 5A. qRT-PCR were used to determine the expression level of miR396 in different tissues. The results showed that the expression of miR396 was the lowest in roots, and was mainly expressed in leaves. The expression of miR396 in root, leaf and flower were respectively 2, 17, and 4-fold greater than that in the bulb (Fig. 5B). This co-expression analysis also showed that miR396 was negatively correlated with the target LaTYDC1. As miRNA paired with LaTYDC1 mRNA to direct transcriptional suppression, we did qRT-PCR to determine miR396 expression under MeJA treatment, and the expression of miR396 was repressed about one half of the vehicle sample. Twelve hours after MeJA treatment, the expression of miR396 increased \u223c3 folds (Fig. 5C). Combined with the repressed expression of LaTYDC1, the reversely correlated expression relationship suggests that miR396 may target LaTYDC1. RLM-RACE experiments were carried out to confirm the cleavage, and the cleavage sites were mapped in flanking sequence of the complementary region (Fig. 5D), the DNA sequences in the RLM-RACE experiments were listed in Supplemental Information 2).",

In fact, TYDC catalyzes the initial reaction of many secondary metabolites, such as salidroside in Rhodiolasa chalinensis (Zhang et al., 2011), verbascoside in Syringa vulgaris (Ellis, 1983) and hordenine in Hordeum vulgare (Leete & Marion, 2011). In Lycoris plants, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is converted to tyramine by TYDC and provides the basic bone for Amaryllidaceae alkaloids including galanthamine (Kilgore et al., 2014). Tyramine and many secondary metabolites play important anti-stress roles, and the accumulation of them could help the plant get over stress (Lehmann & Pollmann, 2009; Kabera et al., 2014). JAs are the key signals in stress response and trigger secondary metabolite production (De Geyter et al., 2012). Under JA signaling, the increase of galanthamine is significant (Colque et al., 2004; Mu et al., 2009; Ptak et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2013). Meanwhile the content of tyramine in L. aurea seedlings was almost two fold when compared with the control (Fig. 2), and the expression of LaTYDC1 was activated (Fig. 3C). In addition, the expression pattern of LaTYDC1 was in line with the accumulation pattern of galanthamine (Fig. 3B; Fig. S3). All of these results indicated that under MeJA treatment, the accumulation of galanthamine is associated with the increase of tyramine content.",

This showed that final product yield is associated with the expression level of the initial enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway (Zhang et al., 2011). In this study, under MeJA treatment, the content of tyramine was just double fold when compared with the untreated seedlings (Fig. 2), but the transcription of LaTYDC1 enormously increased (Fig. 3C). The enzyme activity was not correctly in line with the transcriptional level of LaTYDC1, most likely due to post-transcriptional modification. The stability of mRNA (Parker & Song, 2004; Wilusz, Wormington & Peltz, 2001), the half-life of mRNA, the regulation of the translation (Preiss & Hentze, 2003), and so on, create a varied and complex mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation that controls gene expression (Mata & Al, 2005; Roundtree & He, 2016).",

In our results, miR396 was identified from the L. aurea miRNA profile, which is responsive to MeJA treatment. By analyzing the degradome sequencing data, miR396 targets LaTYDC1 (Fig. 5A). At the beginning of the MeJA treatment, the expression of LaTYDC1 greatly increased (Fig. 3C); meanwhile miR396 was still at the lower level as the control (Fig. 5C). However, with the treatment alone, the expression of miR396 was elevated to a higher level, and the expression of LaTYDC1 was decreased to only one half of the 6-h treatment samples. Based on our previous miRNA sequencing work (Xu et al., 2016), along with the expressional relationship between miR396, LaTYDC1, and the degradome sequencing data together, it is reflected that miR396 negatively regulates LaTYDC1.",

            "text": "In Arabidopsis, seven of the GRFs contain the cleavage sites recognized by miR396. These miR396-GRFs target interaction, control the proliferation of cells in leaves, pistil development and the switch between stem cell and transit-amplifying cells in roots (Debernardi et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2015). Also, miR396 regulate other transcription factors as bHLH74, which is necessary for normal development of Arabidopsis (Debernardi et al., 2012). In this work, we reported the regulation of an additional target of miR396, the enzyme LaTYDC1. According to the degradome data, in LaTYDC1 gene there is one binding site of miR396, and the cleavage site is shown in Fig. 5A. However, the RLM-RACE experiment failed to confirm this cleavage site, although we repeated the experiment several times with different primers. After sequencing the DNA fragments, the cleavage site was not positioned in the predicted target region. Two out of five reads were mapped at the 85th, and the other three reads were at the 122nd nucleotide downstream of the predicted cleavage sites (Fig. 5D). Although we cannot explain the possibility that we failed to get the right cleavage products, the phenomenon that RLM-RACE mapped the cleavage sites beyond the predicted target region was also observed for other miRNAs (Li et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014). It is likely that these fragments that resulted from miRNA cleavage are very susceptible to degradation induced by RNA decay proteins (Li et al., 2015).",
