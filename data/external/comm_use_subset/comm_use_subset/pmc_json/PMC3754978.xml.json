Involved in many diseases such as cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative, inflammatory and respiratory disorders, GPCRs are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs [4]. Over half of all prescription drugs currently on the market are actually acting by targeting GPCRs directly or indirectly [5], [6]. A lot of efforts have been invested for studying GPCRs in both academic institutions and pharmaceutical industries.",

            "text": "Identification of drug-target interactions is an essential step in the drug discovery process, which is the most important task for the new medicine development [7]. The methods commonly used in this regard are docking simulations [8], [9], literature text mining [10], as well as a combination of chemical structure, genomic sequence, and 3D (three-dimensional) structure information, among others [11]. Obviously, an experimental 3D structure of a target protein is the key for identifying the drug-protein interaction; if it is not available, the common approach is to create a homology model of the target protein based on the experimental structure of a related protein [12], [13], [14]. However, the above methods need further development due to the following reasons. (1) None of these methods has provided a web-server for the public usage, and hence their practical application value is quite limited. (2) The prediction quality needs to be improved with the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and updated training datasets. (3) GPCRs belong to membrane proteins, which are very difficult to crystallize and most of them will not dissolve in normal solvents. Although a series of recent reports [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] have demonstrated that NMR is indeed a very powerful tool in determining the 3D structures of membrane proteins, it is time-consuming and costly. Also, although using various structural bioinformatics tools [12], particularly the homologous technique [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], can help acquire the structural and functional information of membrane proteins, unfortunately the number of templates for membrane proteins is quite limited. Therefore, it would be very useful to develop a computational method for predicting the interactions between drugs and GPCRs in cellular networking based on their sequences-derived features before a drug candidate was synthesized, so as to reduce the unnecessary waste of time and money [27]. And this is the goal of the current study.",

The identification of small molecules or structures can be used to detect the drug-target interactions [34]. Molecular fingerprints are bit-string representations of molecular structure and properties [35]. It should be pointed out that there are many types of structural representation that have been suggested for the description of drug molecules, including physicochemical properties [36], chemical graphs [37], topological indices [38], 3D pharmacophore patterns and molecular fields. In the current study, let us use the simple and generally adopted 2D molecular fingerprints to represent drug molecules, as described below.",

Second, we can convert the MOL file format into its 2D molecular fingerprint file format by using a chemical toolbox software called OpenBabel [40], which can be downloaded from the website at http://openbabel.org/. The current version of OpenBabel can generate four types of fingerprints: FP2, FP3, FP4 and MACCS. In the current study, we used the FP2 fingerprint format. It is a path-based fingerprint that identifies small molecule fragments based on all linear and ring substructures and maps them onto a bit-string using a hash function (somewhat similar to the Daylight fingerprints [41], [42]). It is a length of 256-bit hexadecimal string or a 256-bit vector, whose component values are an integer between 0 and 15. Let us suppose  is the 1st value of the 256-bit vector,  that of the 2nd value, and so forth. Thus, the 256-bit vector can be converted to a digit signal. In order to find the inwardness of the drug fingerprint values, we implement the discrete Fourier transform, with the frequency-domain values given by(2)where j represents the imaginary unit and  is a complex number whose complex modulus or amplitude is given by(3)where  is the real part of  and  the corresponding image part.

            "text": "The sequences of the GPCRs involved in this study are given in Supporting Information S3. Now the problem is how to effectively represent these receptor sequences for the current study. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of approaches to formulate protein sequences: the sequential model and the non-sequential or discrete model [43]. The most typical sequential representation for a protein sample with  residues is its entire amino acid sequence, as can be formulated as(6)where  represents the 1st residue of the protein sequence ,  the 2nd residue, and so forth. A protein thus formulated can contain its most complete information. This is an obvious advantage of the sequential representation. To get the desired results, the sequence-similarity-search-based tools, such as BLAST [44], [45], are usually utilized to conduct the prediction. However, this kind of approach failed to work when the query protein did not have significant homology to proteins of known characters. Thus, various non-sequential representation models were proposed. The simplest non-sequential model for a protein was based on its amino acid composition (AAC), as defined by(7)where  are the normalized occurrence frequencies of the 20 native amino acids [46], [47] in the protein , and  has the same meaning as in Eq. 5. The AAC-discrete model was widely used for identifying various attributes of proteins. However, as can be seen from Eq. 7, all the sequence order effects were lost by using the AAC-discrete model. This is its main shortcoming. To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information, the pseudo amino acid composition was proposed [48] to replace the simple amino acid composition (AAC) for representing the sample of a protein. Since the concept of PseAAC (also called \u201cChou\u2019s PseAAC\u201d [49]) was proposed in 2001 [48], it has been widely used to study various attributes of proteins, such as discriminating outer membrane proteins [50], identifying antibacterial peptides [51], identifying allergenic proteins [52], predicting metalloproteinase family [53], predicting protein structural class [54], identifying bacterial virulent proteins [55], predicting supersecondary structure [56], predicting protein subcellular location [57], [58], [59], [60], predicting membrane protein types [61], [62], identifying GPCRs and their types [63], identifying protein quaternary structural attributes [64], predicting protein submitochondria locations [65], identifying risk type of human papillomaviruses [66], identifying cyclin proteins [67], predicting GABA(A) receptor proteins [68], classifying amino acids [69], predicting cysteine S-nitrosylation sites in proteins [30], among many others (see a long list of papers cited in the References section of [28]). Recently, the concept of PseAAC was further extended to represent the feature vectors of DNA and nucleotides [29], [31], as well as other biological samples (see, e.g., [70], [71]). Because it has been widely and increasingly used, recently two powerful soft-wares called \u201cPseAAC-Builder\u201d [72] and \u201cpropy\u201d [73] were established for generating various special Chou\u2019s pseudo-amino acid compositions, in addition to the web-server PseAAC [74] built in 2008. According to a recent review [28], the general form of PseAAC for a protein  is formulated by(8)where the subscript  is an integer, and its value as well as the components  will depend on how to extract the desired information from the amino acid sequence of  (cf. Eq. 6). Below, let us describe how to extract useful information from the benchmark dataset  and Supporting Information S2 to define the GPCR samples concerned via Eq. 8.",

Listed in \nTable 1\n are the ten different kinds of physicochemical properties usually used for identifying protein attributes [75]. For the current study, however, it was found through many preliminary tests that when the 10th physicochemical property (i.e., the \u201cmean polarity\u201d) was used, the best prediction quality was observed. This is quite consistent with the observations that polar amino acids play an important role in membrane protein receptors [12], [17]. Accordingly, the 20 numerical values of the mean polarity in \nTable 1\n were used to encode the 20 native amino acids in a GPCR sequence. Note that to ensure that each of these numerical codes was a positive number as required by the Grey model used later, during the encoding process, each of the mean polarity values in \nTable 1\n was added by a number of 1.20. Thus, for a given GPCR sequence with  amino acids (cf. Eq. 6), we can convert it into a series of  real number as formulated by(9)where  is the mean polarity value for the 1st amino acid residue in the GPCR protein , e.g., if the 1st residue is A, then we have ;  is the mean polarity value for the 2nd amino acid residue plus 1.20; and so forth. Now, we can use the grey system model to extract the useful information of  via Eq. 8 to formulate its PseAAC.",

The rationale of the fuzzy method is based on the fact that it is impossible to define a feature vector that can contain all the entire information of a complicated system. Therefore, it is logically more reasonable to treat this kind of object as a fuzzy system.

Generally speaking, to avoid the \u201cmemory effect\u201d [43] of the resubstitution test in which a same dataset was used to train and test a predictor, the following three cross-validation methods are often used to examine a predictor for its effectiveness in practical application: independent dataset test, subsampling or K-fold (such as 5-fold, 7-fold, or 10-fold) test, and jackknife test [93]. However, as elaborated by a penetrating analysis in [98], considerable arbitrariness exists in the independent dataset test. Also, as demonstrated by Eqs. 28\u201330 in [28], the subsampling test (or K-fold cross validation) cannot avoid arbitrariness either. Only the jackknife test is the least arbitrary that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset. Therefore, the jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly adopted by investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [51], [52], [99]). In view of this, the success rate by the jackknife test was also used to optimize the two uncertain parameters K and  in Eq. 15. The result thus obtained is shown in \nFig. 3\n, from which we obtain when  and  the iGPCR-Drug predictor reaches its optimized status.",

In contrast, the corresponding success rate obtained by He et al. [32] in using six biochemical and physicochemical features to formulate GPCR-Drug samples was only 78.49%. The remarkable improved success rate indicates that introducing 2D molecular fingerprints to represent drug samples and using the grey PseAAC to represent GPCR samples are really a promising approach for studying the interactions of GPCRs and drugs in cellular network, where the former can catch the essence of the drug sample whereas the latter can catch the essence of the GPCR sample.",

Particularly, it cannot be used to predict the binding site and binding energy between GPCR and drug. Only when the 3D structures for both the GPCR receptor and its drug ligand are known or well defined, can we try to predict their binding details via molecular docking (see, e.g., [9]). Nevertheless, before their 3D structures are available, the current sequence-derived approach can serve as a high throughput tool for predicting GPCR\u2013drug interactions in cellular networking. This is particularly useful in conducting large-scale analysis for the avalanche of biological sequences generated in the post-genomic age.",
