By altering different components of the nucleoside, such as the nucleobase, sugar moiety, and phosphate group, medicinal chemists can develop novel analogues for their use in various therapeutics [1,2]. Over the past decade, research in the Seley-Radtke lab has focused on the development of various types of flexible nucleoside analogues, called \u201cfleximers\u201d, that have demonstrated the ability to overcome point mutations within the binding site of biologically significant enzymes (Figure 1) [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20].

Furthermore, the addition of an acetate protecting group (1-Ac) led to a decrease in antiviral activity, but also a large decrease in cytotoxicity (unpublished results). In order to explore the effects of different hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups on the fleximer pyrimidine ring, as well as the effect of various acetate protecting groups on antiviral activity, an SAR study was pursued.

Reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Rockville, MD, USA), Alfa Aesar (Haverhill, MA, USA), and Combiblocks (San Diego, CA, USA). Solvents were either purchased as anhydrous or were dried using the MBRAUN solvent purification system (MB-SPS) (MBRAUN, Stratham, NH, USA). Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) using EMD silica gel 60 F254 coated glass-backed TLC plates (Milliporesigma, Rockville, MD, USA) and visualized with a UV lamp and/or KMnO4 stain (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Column chromatography was performed on a CombiFlash\u00aeRf automated chromatography using REdiSep Rf silica (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, NE, USA). High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) purification was performed on an LC-8A Shimadzu preparation liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA) using a Zorbax SB C18 column 9.4 \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m. Samples were lyophilized utilizing a Labconco Freezone 1 L lyophilizer. 1H-NMR spectra was recorded on a JEOL Eclipse ECX (400 MHz) (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA, USA) or a Bruker Avance III HD (500 MHz) spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (\u03b4 ppm) from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as an internal standard. Data for the 1H-NMR are reported as follows: br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, dd = doublet of doublets, m = multiplet. 13C-NMR were recorded on a JOEL Eclipse ECX (126 MHz) or a Bruker Advance III HD (101 MHz) spectrometer with complete proton decoupling. Data for 13C-NMR are reported in terms of chemical shifts (\u03b4 ppm) with the solvent resonance as the internal standard. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker AmaZon X quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) (Bruker BioSpin Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The purity of all compounds tested in biological assays were verified by elemental analyses performed by Atlantic Microlabs (Atlantic Microlabs, Norcross, GA, USA). LogP values were calculated using the ChemDraw program by PerkinElmer Informatics (PerkinElmer Informatics, Cambridge, MA, USA).",

While none of the analogues analyzed were cytotoxic up to 100 \u00b5M, none of the analogues were more active against EBOV than compound 1. Regardless, it was determined that the 4-methoxy series were overall more active than the 2-amino series, suggesting that the 4-methoxy moiety may be more important for activity. Furthermore, compounds with logP values greater than 1 but less than 2.4 offer the necessary lipophilicity for activity. It was also found that compounds within series 1 and 2 adopt the typical anti-conformation, whereas compounds within series 5 adopt a syn conformation, thus offering another possible explanation for the differences in antiviral activity. With these initial results in hand, the synthesis of additional analogues, especially those with a methoxy group at the 4 position will be considered, in order to continue to try and further explore antiviral activity. The results of those studies will be reported elsewhere as they become available. ",
