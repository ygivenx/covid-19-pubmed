Second, since immunization with PA63 produces neutralizing antibody, it can be used to immunize animals. In the present study, we developed four murine mAbs that could well neutralize LeTx in vitro, and one clone was selected to form a human/mouse chimeric antibody known as hmPA6. This antibody showed excellent neutralization both in vitro and in vivo.",

Although LF could induce cell death, its effective result in vivo was unsatisfactory. PA was the critical factor which recognized cell membrane receptors. Then PA was cleaved to active PA63 by Furin which induced LF or EF into cells. Our strategy was to get antibody against active PA63. To immunize the mice, we used PA63, which is formed by the dissociation of PA20 from PA83, instead of PA83, because although PA63 is a part of PA83, these factors may have different structures and expose LF- or EF-binding sites. These differences may in turn lead to the production of completely different antibodies against anthrax in vivo. In the present study, we showed that PA63 could induce neutralizing antibodies, as proven through in vitro and vivo experiments. On the other hand, it was difficult to obtain active PA63 based on present methods. We screened out positive clones by active PA63 in a different way. Based on traditional ELISA, we coated plates with alive J774A.1 cells overninght at cell culture condition. Then PA83 was added into wells incubated about 2 h. The negative control was cells without PA83 adding. The rest of ELISA procedures was as normal. In this screening system, the active PA63 was more closed to in vivo state and could oligomerize to heptamer. In all, more diversity antibodies was generated in the immunization stage and more effective antibodies was obtained in the screening system.",

Passive immunization with protective antibodies is therefore considered the primary available biodefense measure21, especially in bioterrorist-associated exposure. In the present study, hmPA6 was found to provide good protection in rats challenged with anthrax virulence factors. In the in vitro experiment, hmPA6 maintained 100% cell viability with 0.01 \u03bcg/mL LF and 0.1 \u03bcg/mL PA83, while non-correlated IgG maintained only 50% cell viability. Further, with 10 \u03bcg/mL LF and 0.1 \u03bcg/mL PA83, hmPA6 maintained >80% cell viability, while the control antibody maintained only 26%. Moreover, in previous study, they often used F344 rats challenged with LeTx (Table 1) before tested with B. anthracis spores. Therefore F344 rats was injected with LeTx vial tail vain. The hmPA6 with a Kd of 0.14 nM protected all rats from death at a concentration of 0.3 mg/kg (45 \u03bcg per rat). However, in a previous study, 1.5 mg/kg raxibacumab (of human origin) with a Kd of 2.78 nM was administered 24 h before anthrax lethal toxin administration in F344 rats24. We also tested an hmPA6 concentration of 0.6 mg/kg (90 \u03bcg per rat) administered 48 h before LeTx injection; this dose also protected all rats. Our findings indicate that hmPA6 may be used as a prophylactic. Other humanized or chimeric mAbs have been examined in other animal model, but the affinity found in the present study is the same as or better than those found previously3233. Murine mAbs against PA have been developed, but our chimeric mAb maintains a balance between the high-affinity murine component and the low-immunogenicity human component. Other mAbs of human origin are available but are difficult to produce and are expensive32. The chimeric mAb hmPA6 is produced in 293F cells, and the method of production is very convenient.",

This finding indicated that hmPA6 could not prevent LF from binding PA63. Further, no morphological changes were observed in the rats of only injection LeTx, probably because the time between injection and sacrifice was very short (only about 90 mins), and no histological changes occurred in this period. The IHC analysis showed a strong positive result in the group injected only LeTx. However, the group that received LeTx + 45 \u03bcg hmPA6 showed a weakly positive reaction. These findings indicate that hmPA6 prevents PA from binding to cell receptors. However, further experiments are required to validate this hypothesis.",
