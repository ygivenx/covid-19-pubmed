            "text": "Neurotropic viral infections are associated with the accumulation of multiple B cell subsets within the central nervous system (CNS) whose composition alters with time, indicating ongoing turnover and differentiation (1\u20133). During infection with a gliatropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) derived from the JHM strain (JHMv2.2-1), IgD-positive (IgD+) (naive/transitional) B cells prevail early, but they decrease coincident with increasing proportions of CD138+ antibody (Ab)-secreting cells (ASC) and CD138\u2212 IgG+ isotype-switched memory B cells (Bmem) as germinal centers (GCs) are formed in draining lymph nodes (1, 2). Whether the turnover in the CNS involves replacement by newly recruited B cells derived from the periphery or local expansion/differentiation of B cells recruited during acute infection is largely unresolved. While ASC in the blood are transiently migratory following antigen (Ag)-driven differentiation, Bmem recirculate for extended periods of time (4, 5). This supports circulating Bmem as a potential replenishing source of ASC in the CNS during persistent infections. However, their contribution to humoral immunity in the CNS following infection or autoimmunity remains poorly characterized.",

            "text": "Ag-specific B cells develop into ASC through two distinct pathways. In the first, Ag-activated B cells rapidly differentiate into short-lived ASC in extrafollicular foci (6\u20139). In the second pathway, B cells activated by Ag and receiving CD4 T cell help at the T cell-B cell follicle border form follicular GCs, where they undergo affinity maturation and isotype switching, ultimately generating Ag-specific Bmem, as well as long-lived IgG ASC. The generation of these IgG ASC and Bmem is significantly impaired in the absence of GCs (10\u201314). GC reactions are marked by class-switched Ig and somatic hypermutation (SHM), thereby imprinting long-lived ASC and Bmem (15\u201318). These processes are both mediated by the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which introduces mutations in DNA by deaminating the cytidine base to create uracil. Uracil-DNA glycosylase and apurinic endonuclease then act to excise uracil, and the gaps are filled in by DNA repair mechanisms (12, 19, 20). Based on its SHM-inducing activity, AID expression constitutes a B cell-specific marker of Ag-induced affinity maturation. While the vast majority of AID-dependent affinity maturation occurs within GCs, resulting in class-switching to IgG (21), there is evidence for extrafollicular, GC-independent SHM resulting in the production of Ag-specific ASC and Abs, including those of the IgM isotype (12, 22).",

            "text": "Following gliatropic MHV CNS infection, T and B cell responses are initiated in cervical lymph nodes (CLN), and local CNS Ab production is crucial for preventing recrudescence of persisting virus following initial T cell-mediated immune control (23, 24). Using the gliatropic MHV-JHMv2.2-1 variant, we have recently demonstrated that B cells in the CNS transition from a predominantly naive/early-activated IgD+ IgM+ population at day 7 p.i. to an IgD-negative (IgD\u2212) IgM+ and increasingly IgG+ population, including CD138+ ASC, by day 21 p.i. (1, 2). Moreover, the B cell coreceptor CD19, which lowers the Ag-specific activation threshold and promotes peripheral GC formation, is required for accumulation of CD138+ ASC in the CNS (14). These data suggested that the vast majority of plasmablasts and IgD\u2212 B cell subsets in the CNS have undergone SHM driven by viral Ag-specific B cell receptor (BCR) activation and do not comprise bystander B cells recruited via Ag-independent proinflammatory signals. However, identification of virus-specific ASC or Bmem generally depends on enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISPOT) techniques using virus or viral lysates as the capture Ag, potentially underestimating their numbers. Measurement of virus-specific Bmem is especially biased by culture conditions, as B cells require nonspecific stimulation in vitro to convert into ASC for subsequent quantitation by ELISPOT (25, 26).",

            "text": "To better characterize the proportions of virus-specific Bmem and ASC accumulating in the CLN and the CNS following viral encephalomyelitis, we took advantage of mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Cre-ERT2) under the Aicda promoter crossed with Rosa26-loxP-tdTomato reporter mice to obtain progeny in which AID-expressing cells can be identified by fluorescence following tamoxifen administration (4, 27). Analysis of humoral responses to protein Ag in AIDCre-Rosa26EYFP mice confirmed that the vast majority of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-expressing B cells were indeed specific for the immunizing Ag (4). These dually transgenic reporter mice are thus suitable tools to phenotypically monitor the dynamics and tissue distribution of B cells having undergone virus-induced, AID-mediated SHM. This study used the MHV-A59 strain, a neurotropic MHV that is less pathogenic than JHMv2.2-1, to determine the frequency, longevity, and distribution of virus-specific ASC and Bmem in the CLN and CNS of infected AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice using the CD19+ tdTomato+ IgD\u2212 CD138+ and the CD19+ tdTomato+ IgD\u2212 CD138\u2212 phenotype, respectfully. Tamoxifen administration at the onset of infection and throughout day 28 p.i. revealed that tdTomato+ B cells only accumulated in the CNS following peripheral GC formation and continued well into the chronic infection phase. Early GC-independent tdTomato+ ASC in the CLN did not appear to migrate to the CNS. Notably, an overall larger proportion of tdTomato+ B cells accumulated earlier and at higher frequencies in spinal cords than in brains. While Bmem dominated the tdTomato+ population in CLN throughout GC activity, they vastly exceeded ASC at early but not later stages of viral persistence. The administration of tamoxifen during chronic disease, starting at day 20 p.i., revealed that \u223c50% of ASC and \u223c25% of Bmem were recruited from later peripheral GC reactions by 28 days p.i., accounting for nearly the entire increase in virus-specific B cells observed in the CNS between days 21 and 28 p.i. Overall, the results show that the vast majority of ASC recruited to both the brain and spinal cord were virus specific, with limited accumulation of ASC with heterologous specificity. In contrast, the fraction of virus-specific cells within the Bmem population was substantially higher in spinal cords than in the brain. These data indicate that B cell subset accumulation during the persistent phase of infection is controlled by peripheral GC-driven events, as well as CNS regional signals.",

We therefore questioned whether early ASC expansion is driven by Ag-independent innate immune signaling, as previously shown for influenza virus and West Nile virus (WNV) infection (30, 31), or whether it is Ag driven but insufficient to monitor via ELISPOT assay. AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice were thus treated with tamoxifen coincident with MHV-A59 inoculation to jointly track the emergence of tdTomato+ cells as a marker for Ag-primed Bmem (CD19+ tdTomato+ IgD\u2212 CD138\u2212) and ASC (CD19+ tdTomato+ IgD\u2212 CD138+) in CLN. Naive mice treated with tamoxifen 2 days prior to analysis were used as controls to assess baseline tdTomato+ B cells.",

Evaluation of tdTomato expression within total IgD\u2212 CD138\u2212 or CD138+ cells indicated the vast majority were recently induced to express AID (Fig. 1C). This was confirmed by monitoring the expansion of B cells expressing GL7, an activation marker for pre-GC and GC B cells (33). The fraction of GL7+ cells was only slightly smaller than that of tdTomato+ cells at day 14 p.i. Moreover, virtually all GL7+ cells were tdTomato+ (Fig. 1D), consistent with GC formation (4, 32). To confirm that the majority of tdTomato+ CD138+ ASC were indeed virus specific, we directly compared the frequencies of CD138+ tdTomato+ B cells obtained by flow cytometry to virus-specific ELISPOT analyses in CLN and brains at day 14 p.i. (Fig. 1E), when virus-specific ASC peak in CLN and emerge within the CNS following MHV-JHMv2.2-1 infection (4, 14, 32). In this experiment, the sum of virus-specific IgG- and IgM-secreting ASC approximated the number of tdTomato+ CD138+ cells at both anatomical sites, supporting their virus specificity.",

            "text": "Having confirmed expansion of tdTomato+ B cells with a largely IgD\u2212 phenotype following virus CNS infection, we monitored tdTomato+ B cell subsets in CLN throughout acute infection (day 7 p.i.) into the persistent phase (days 14 to 28 p.i.). The proportion of tdTomato+ cells within total B cells was already increased at day 7 p.i. compared to that in naive mice, steadily rose to \u223c7% by day 21 p.i., and remained stable thereafter (Fig. 2). The GL7+ B cell fraction was not increased until day 14 p.i. and reached maximum levels of \u223c5% at day 21 p.i. (Fig. 2). Moreover, the fraction of GL7+ B cells expressing tdTomato increased to 80% by day 7 p.i. and plateaued at \u223c90% by day 14 p.i. (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with the formation of well-defined GC at day 14 p.i. and segregation into structurally mature GC defined by dark- and light-zone domains by day 21 p.i. following infection with the JHMv2.2-1 virus variant (1). Moreover, the results confirmed AID-dependent SHM and class switch recombination (CSR), typical of GC B cells, and showed maintenance of GC activity out to day 28 p.i. during chronic infection. The increased proportion of GL7+ cells by day 14 p.i., as well as their tdTomato expression, support the idea that induction of GL7+ is specifically induced by viral Ag (Fig. 2 and 3). Contrasting with the progressively increasing proportions of tdTomato+ and GL7+ cells after day 14 p.i., CD138+ ASC proportions within CLN B cells peaked at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2), suggesting that they were largely GC independent. Moreover, the fraction of ASC rapidly declined and only slowly increased again by day 28 p.i. (Fig. 2), similar to previous results during MHV-JHMv2.2-1 infection (14, 23). Surprisingly, however, 50% to 60% of ASC at day 7 p.i. were tdTomato+, compared to \u223c5% in naive mice, and these percentages were sustained throughout day 28 p.i. (Fig. 2). These results are consistent with virus-activated AID expression and SHM prior to robust GC formation. However, it could not be discerned whether tdTomato+ ASC at later times comprised a distinct or more differentiated GC-derived subset. Importantly, the kinetics of IgD\u2212 CD138\u2212 Bmem did not mirror those observed for ASC. Total Bmem did not show increased frequencies within CD19+ CLN B cells in infected compared to naive mice until day 21 p.i. (Fig. 2). Bmem and ASC exhibited similar fractions of tdTomato+ cells in naive CLN (\u223c7%). However, unlike ASC, Bmem did not demonstrate a rapid increase in the frequency of tdTomato+ cells at day 7 p.i. Despite this initial divergence, the tdTomato+ fraction in Bmem increased to \u223c50% at day 14 p.i. and remained stable out to day 28 p.i. (Fig. 2). The production of Ag-primed ASC and Bmem thus displayed discrete kinetics in CLN following MHV infection. Finally, while the fraction of tdTomato+ cells in phenotypically naive IgD+ cells increased by day 14 p.i. and remained elevated compared to that in naive mice, it remained <4%, suggesting rapid differentiation into IgD\u2212 memory cells (Fig. 2) (1).",

Total CD19+ B cells were stable throughout day 14 p.i. and decreased thereafter, reflecting overall decreased cellularity of CLN following intracranial (i.c.) MHV infection. Although the percentages of tdTomato+ B cells slowly increased throughout days 7 to 21 p.i. (Fig. 2), the absolute numbers of tdTomato+ cells were most abundant at day 14 p.i., reflecting peak total CD19+ cells (Fig. 3A). The numbers of GL7+ B cells, with the vast majority being tdTomato+, mirrored the kinetics of GC formation (1). Total ASC peaked at day 7 p.i. (\u223c2.0 \u00d7 104), prior to maximal GL7+ B cells (\u223c8.0 \u00d7 104), reflecting peak CD138+ percentages within the B cell population. By day 28 p.i., ASC declined rapidly, reaching only \u223c2 \u00d7 103 (Fig. 3A). The high proportion (\u223c65%) of ASC expressing tdTomato at day 7 p.i. thus surpassed AID-expressing ASC numbers during maximal GC differentiation after day 14 p.i. (Fig. 3A).

The decrease in tdTomato+ Bmem supports the notion of egress into circulation following peak GC formation. Interestingly, the dynamics of tdTomato+ Bmem in the CLN closely resemble those of GL7+ GC B cells, suggesting a relatively constant production of Ag-primed Bmem throughout the formation and contraction of GCs (Fig. 3A). However, as was the case with ASC, it remains unclear whether the tdTomato+ Bmem are more differentiated or exhibit increased affinity. The numbers of tdTomato+ IgD+ B cells were consistently low (<3.0 \u00d7 104) (data not shown).",

At day 7 p.i., AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice already exhibited small foci of tdTomato+ B cells within follicles, indicative of early GC formation. tdTomato+ B cells were also evident at extrafollicular locations, consistent with GC-independent expansion of tdTomato+ ASC (Fig. 4). By day 14 p.i., tdTomato+ B cells formed large foci typical of GC morphology within follicles; these structures were maintained through day 21 p.i. (Fig. 4) and day 28 p.i. (data not shown). Overall, these kinetics of GC formation are similar to those of infection with MHV-JHM2.2v-1 (1).

However, it remained unclear whether they were continuously recruited from ongoing peripheral GC reactions or underwent further affinity maturation and differentiation within the CNS during persistent infection. Neither ASC nor Bmem isolated from the MHV-JHMv2.2-1-infected CNS at day 21 p.i. exhibited detectable Aicda transcripts, indicating that these cells were not undergoing SHM within the CNS (2). To confirm sparse if any Aicda mRNA expression in the CNS of tamoxifen-treated, MHV-A59-infected AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato mice, in which AID is only expressed from one allele (4), we monitored Aicda mRNA levels in CLN relative to the levels in brains and spinal cords throughout infection (Fig. 8). Ighg mRNA levels were assessed as a measure of ASC IgG secretion (2). In CLN, Aicda mRNA levels increased between days 5 and 7 p.i. and were further elevated by day 21 p.i., corresponding with GC formation. In contrast, although a statistically significant increase in Aicda mRNA was evident in brains and spinal cords at day 14 p.i., the levels were overall \u223c4 orders of magnitude (104) lower than in CLN. Ighg mRNA levels increased prominently in CLN by day 14 p.i., reflecting GC-matured ASC. In the CNS, Ighg mRNA levels also did not increase significantly until day 14 p.i., and the levels increased further by day 21 p.i. Moreover, the levels were \u223c10-fold higher in spinal cords than in brains, consistent with higher IgG secretion. These mRNA kinetics were similar to those in MHV-JHMv2.2-1-infected mice (2). While Ighg mRNA levels were overall lower in the CNS than in CLN, the \u223c100-fold-higher ratio of Aicda relative to Ighg mRNA levels in CLN versus spinal cords (\u223c1 \u00d7 10\u22123 versus 5 \u00d7 10\u22125, respectively) confirmed minimal local AID activity in the CNS.",

This approach ensures that only those B cells primed or undergoing continuous differentiation after day 20 p.i. are marked by tdTomato expression. Any accumulation of tdTomato+ B cells in the CNS after day 20 p.i. would imply that these cells were derived from protracted peripheral GC reactions sustained during the chronic phase. CLN, brain, and spinal cord cells were thus assessed for the presence of tdTomato+ ASC and Bmem cells by flow cytometry 8 days after initial tamoxifen administration (day 28 p.i.). Slightly reduced frequencies of tdTomato+ B cells within total CD19+ B cells in CLN in mice receiving tamoxifen starting at day 20 p.i. compared to those starting at day 0 p.i. did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 9). Furthermore, mice receiving tamoxifen treatment at day 20 p.i. revealed a frequency of \u223c30% tdTomato+ cells in the CD138+ ASC population, similar to the frequency in mice receiving tamoxifen continuously from day 0 p.i. (Fig. 9), indicating that nearly all the virus-specific ASC present in the CLN during chronic disease had undergone affinity maturation after day 20 p.i. in established GCs. Importantly, the frequencies of tdTomato+ cells within the GL7+ GC phenotype B cells were similar, at \u223c80% (Fig. 9). These results support continual selection and turnover of virus-specific B cells in the CLN, consistent with ongoing GC reactions during chronic infection.",

Furthermore, although both IgM+ and IgG+ B cells are recruited to the CNS, their specificity or derivation from ongoing GC reactions remains largely unexplored. We therefore infected AIDCre-Rosa26tdTomato reporter mice with MHV-A59 to monitor the expansion and distribution of B cells having undergone SHM as an indicator of viral-Ag-induced activation. Our results demonstrate that tdTomato+ B cells in draining lymph nodes were already evident at day 7 p.i., prior to peak GL7+ activated and GC B cells, as well as defined GC structures evident at day 14 p.i. This early, GC-independent, tdTomato+ population was comprised of similar proportions of CD138+ ASC and IgD\u2212 CD138\u2212 Bmem. Moreover, CD138+ tdTomato+ ASC peaked at day 7 p.i., accounting for \u223c65% of total ASC. While the early expansion of ASC prior to GC formation confirmed results in Blimp-GFP mice infected with the more pathogenic, sublethal MHV-JHMv2.2-1 variant (23), these ASC were previously interpreted to result from innate bystander activation, as they were undetectable in virus-specific ELISPOT assays (14). However, their high frequency of tdTomato expression indicates that these ASC are viral Ag specific but produce Ab with insufficient affinity to be detected by virus-specific ELISPOT. This notion is supported by MHV-JHMv2.2-1 infection of CD19-deficient mice (14), in which a significant reduction in early ASC within CLN at day 7 p.i. was consistent with the function of CD19 to lower the Ag-driven B cell activation threshold. Interestingly, somatic mutations introduced by AID may not be viral Ag selected but may still be specific, as previously reported in a subset of long-lived, GC-independent, IgM-secreting ASC induced by vaccination or peripheral infection (12). Nevertheless, independent of SHM evident at day 7 p.i., these ASC do not appear to be migration competent, as tdTomato+ ASC do not emerge in the CNS until day 14 p.i. Irrespective of migration capacity, these results are consistent with preferential retention of Ag-induced, long-lived IgM ASC in the spleen following peripheral immunization or infection (12).",

Mature GCs in CLN were sustained out to at least day 28 p.i. (data not shown), but tdTomato+ B cell numbers declined after day 14 p.i., consistent with the death of low-affinity clones during ongoing affinity maturation and/or egress from lymphoid tissue into circulation. The progressive increase in tdTomato+ B cells in the CNS thus supported the idea of ongoing egress of GC-matured B cells from CLN and subsequent migration to the persistently infected CNS. Overall, these results suggested that GCs are important for licensing migration of Ag-specific B cells to sites of inflammation. The idea of imprinting of migratory capacity by GCs was supported by the increasing percentages of tdTomato+ cells within the ASC and Bmem populations, which ultimately represented a majority within both subsets. However, a lower proportion of tdTomato+ cells within Bmem in brains compared to the proportion in spinal cords suggests that additional events dictated by the regional CNS environment control the recruitment or survival of Ag-specific B cells. Overall, the preferential accumulation of tdTomato+ B cells throughout persistence demonstrated that recently activated B cells display enhanced CNS migratory capacity compared to that of preexisting, non-MHV-specific ASC or Bmem with heterologous specificity.",

The steadily increasing proportion of ASC in the CNS by day 28 p.i. suggested more efficient CLN egress and/or migration of ASC than of Bmem during ongoing GC reactions. These findings are overall consistent with a temporal switch observed in the output of GCs following model Ag immunization: GCs are initially dedicated to generating Bmem and only switch to ASC output after peak Bmem expansion (35). However, limiting viral Ag in CLN during persistence may reduce ASC over Bmem output in CLN. Nevertheless, the progressive ASC emergence relative to that of Bmem in the CNS over time supports the notion that early GC reactions are dedicated to preferential production of Bmem with the capacity to migrate to the CNS.",

Whether these tdTomato+ B cells are derived from cells already expressing AID and undergoing further affinity maturation after day 20 p.i. or from newly primed B cells recruited to GCs remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the less prominent reductions of tdTomato+ cells in ASC compared to the reductions in Bmem in both brains and spinal cords following late compared to early tamoxifen treatment is consistent with the notion that ongoing recruitment primarily involves ASC still undergoing SHM after day 20 p.i. These data are also consistent with preferential output of migratory ASC by day 28 p.i. We have excluded de novo AID expression within the CNS based on previous analysis of mRNA transcript levels from IgD\u2212 CD138\u2212 Bmem and CD138+ ASC isolated from the CNS at 21 days p.i. (2), as well as IgD+ B cells at day 7 p.i. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that the relative increase in ASC over Bmem in the CNS may also be driven by local conversion of Bmem into ASC by persistent viral Ag, ongoing pattern recognition receptor mediation, or cytokine stimulation.",

            "text": "Overall, our data demonstrate for the first time that virus-specific B cells exhibiting SHM only emerge in the CNS following peripheral GC formation. Moreover, the accumulation of ASC and Bmem appears to be regulated by temporal events within GCs, as well as CNS regional cues during viral persistence. While early GC reactions supported preferential Bmem accumulation in the CNS, late GC reactions preferentially mediated ASC migration to the CNS. Importantly, virus-specific B cells expressing AID in peripheral GCs sustained during CNS viral persistence are continually recruited to the chronically infected CNS. While these data do not support involvement of bystander recruitment of preexisting Bmem or ASC with irrelevant specificity to CNS inflammation, they do predict that sustained GC reactivity may recruit de novo B cell activation to Ags released from damaged tissue. Such B cells may thus give rise to autoreactive Abs or promote autoreactive T cells, as recently demonstrated in multiple sclerosis (42).",
