Plant lectins exist as multiple molecular species (i.e., isolectins such as Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA120), RCA60, GSL-I A4, and GSL-I B4 [1,7,8,9,10,11]). These plant lectins have long been utilized in the glycoscience field, especially when no methods are available other than anti-glycan antibodies. Therefore, knowledge about glycan-binding properties is crucial to interpret the results obtained by their use.",

Hevein was originally found in latex from rubber as a component of chitinase in 1970. Although hevein is known to show relatively weak (i.e., 1 mM or lower Kd) affinity for chito-oligosaccharides [12,13,14], other chitin-binding lectins have multiple carbohydrate-binding domains and their amino acid sequences are significantly different, including the conserved aromatic residues involved in GlcNAc recognition (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Van Damme has proposed the categorization of the known plant lectins, including chitin-binding lectins, into three groups: merolectin, horolectin, and chimerolectin. Further, superlectin was designated as a special group of chimerolectin [15]. This classification is analogous to that of galectins forming a large group of animal lectins (e.g., \u201cproto type\u201d consisting of a single carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) such as galectin-1, 2 and 7, \u201ctandem-repeat type\u201d consisting of multiple CRDs such as galectin-4, 8 and 9, and \u201cchimera type\u201d consisting of a CRD and a non-CRD structural domain such as galectin-3 [16]). With regard to the binding specificity of chitin-binding lectins, WGA is known to bind heavily sialylated glycans [17,18] and tomato lectin (LEL) preferentially binds to repeated structures of N-acetyllactosamine (poly-LacNAc) [19,20]. However, details of the glycan-binding specificity of these chitin-binding lectins are not known, even though they are well-known plant lectins.",

            "text": "In this study, six chitin-binding lectins, Datura stramonium agglutinin (DSA), Lycopersicon esculentum (currently renamed Solanum lycopersicum) lectin (LEL; tomato lectin), Phytolacca americana mitogen (PWM; pokeweed mitogen), Solanum tuberosum lectin (STL; potato lectin), Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), and Triticum vulgaris agglutinin (WGA; wheat germ agglutinin), belonging to the hevein family, were investigated for their glycan-binding properties. WGA is extensively used as a probe to stain cell membranes [21,22]. LEL is also used for histochemical staining of the vascular endothelium [23,24]. Other lectins are also used as probes to stain animal tissue sections [25,26]. WGA isolated from the germ of wheat (Gramineae) is a tandem-repeat type lectin consisting of four hevein domains of homo or hetero dimers [27,28,29,30,31,32]. As shown by Yamaguchi et al. and Hayashida et al. [14,33,34,35], PWM isolated from the root of pokeweed (Phytolaccaceae) also belongs to a tandem-repeat type, existing as a dimer. UDA isolated from the rhizome of stinging nettle (Urticaceae) is also a tandem-repeat type lectin, consisting of two hevein domains [36,37,38]. In contrast, STL isolated from the plant tuber potato and DSA isolated from the seed of thornapple (Solanaceae) are more complex and categorized as a chimera-type lectin, both of which contain four hevein domain repeats and an extensin-like domain, the latter of which is located between two N-terminal hevein domains and two C-terminal domains, the function of which is not known [39,40,41,42,43]. LEL isolated from the fruit of tomato (Solanaceae) also belongs to a chimera-type lectin, comprised of a single and three hevein domain repeats in the N- and C-terminus of the dimer, respectively, and an extensin-like domain in between, unlike STL and DSA [44,45] (Figure 1).",

Further analysis by a lectin microarray, where 43 commercial lectins, including the six chitin-binding lectins, are immobilized [50,51], was performed by probing with a serum glycoprotein, fetuin (FET), both before and after sialidase treatment to examine how the signal patterns are changed on the chitin-binding lectins.

However, the determined Kd values varied considerably among the six lectins. Those determined for PA-chitotetrasaccharide (907; note that reducing terminal GlcNAc takes an open form as a result of pyridylamination and, thus, may not contribute to full recognition in some lectins) were 43 (DSA), 0.64 (LEL), 53 (PWM), 12 (STL), 3.8 UDA), and 4.1 \u03bcM (WGA). On the other hand, DSA, PWM, and STL did not show detectable affinity for chitotriose (906), while the Kd value of WGA was almost the same as that for chitotetraose. Notably, observed affinities of DSA for these chito-oligosaccharides were relatively low compared with other oligosaccharides to which DSA binds, such as branched N-glycans (323 and 418). In this context, DSA is unique in that it showed significant affinity for a series of oligo-\u03b11-4-glucose, (Glc\u03b11-4)3\u20137 (908, 927\u2013930).

However, as noted above, LEL showed much stronger affinity for both chito-oligosaccharides (906 and 907) and oligo-LacNAc (901, 902, 903, and 905) than DSA. When the affinities of LEL for 901, 902, 903, and 905 were compared, it was evident that LEL affinity increased with the increasing number of LacNAc units: 901 (N.D.) < 902 (39 \u03bcM) < 903 (10 \u03bcM) < 905 (2.9 \u03bcM). DSA showed a similar tendency, but affinities to these oligo-LacNAc structures are relatively low; i.e., 901 (87 \u03bcM) < 902 (48 \u03bcM) < 903 (43 \u03bcM) < 905 (17 \u03bcM). Thus, LEL appears to work as a good probe for detecting oligo- or poly-LacNAc chains in N-, O-glycans, or glycolipids. On the other hand, affinities for these oligosaccharides were low for WGA and UDA, and not detectable for PWM and STL, though previous papers report that PWM bound to poly-LacNAc chains with a GlcNAc\u03b21-6Gal branched structure, which is the result of I-GlcNAc transferase action [64].",

This result suggests that PWM can bind glycans with elongation of the Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b2 branch, but \u03b11-2 extension from the \u03b11-3Man\u03b2 branch blocks the binding. This observation conflicts with a previous report that PWM (Pa-2) binds glycans with Man\u03b11-2 extension of the \u03b11-3Man\u03b2 branch [55]. This discrepancy may be ascribed to the occurrence of isolectins, because the PWM used in this study was commercial product [65]. In this context, it is intriguing to know which feature is functionally related to the mitogenic activity of PWM and DSA in terms of isolectins, which other chitin-binding lectins lack [66,67].",

Detailed structural inspection leads to speculation that UDA requires the presence of a Man\u03b11-3(Man\u03b11-6)Man\u03b11-6Man\u03b2 structure, in which both non-reducing terminal Man\u03b11-3 and Man\u03b11-6 can be modified with Man\u03b11-2 (Figure 5B).

Yamamoto et al. previously reported that WGA bound to hybrid-type N-glycans [70]. Therefore, we undertook further analysis using an additional set of hybrid-type N-glycans, i.e., 051, 053, 055, 056, 057, and 058. We found that WGA specifically bound to hybrid-type N-glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc residue (051, 052, 053, 055, and 058), but did not bind to molecules without it (056 and 057, Figure 6). However, WGA showed much lowered binding to complex-type N-glycans, even though they are equipped with a bisecting GlcNAc residue, 104 (1000 \u03bcM), 108 (1400 \u03bcM), 203 (1200 \u03bcM), 305 (1200 \u03bcM), and 311 (290 \u03bcM). The affinity significantly decreased with the introduction of a LacNAc structure with GlcNAc transferase (GnT) IV, as seen in comparisons between 051 (20 \u03bcM) and 052 (29 \u03bcM) and between 053 (19 \u03bcM) and 055 (33 \u03bcM). A sole exception is 310 (170 \u03bcM), which is a GlcNAc-exposed triantennary complex-type N-glycan lacking a bisecting GlcNAc residue. Considering the fact that WGA has no binding affinity for fully galactosylated glycans 308 and 406, which contain a bisecting GlcNAc residue, nor for an agalactosylated biantennary glycan 103, substantial binding to 310 as well as its analogue 311 could be attributed to the occurrence of a non-reducing terminal GlcNAc at two branch positions caused by GnT I and II as well as branching catalyzed by GnT IV.",

Considering that [6S]LacNAc, as well as its precursor LacNAc, are major components of KS, the inability of STL to bind to this neoglycoprotein (KS chemically conjugated to bovine serum albumin [49]) is possibly a result of insufficient interaction with the epitope structures under the experimental conditions employed in this work.",

However, DSA and UDA bound almost exclusively to TG (B4). This may reflect the difference in sialylation; FET contains sialylated triantennary N-glycans as the main components and AGP contains sialylated tri and tetraantennary N-glycans, while TF is composed of sialylated biantennary and TG contains high-mannose-type N-glycans in addition to biantennary complex-type and hybrid-type N-glycans. DSA, PWM, and UDA binding to TG (B4) may in part be attributed to binding to high-mannose-type N-glycans, which is consistent with FAC results. Other lectins (LEL and STL) also bound to TG (B4) but to a much lesser extent.

Moreover, it should also be noted that any array platform is basically different from FAC in that the former is a \u201ccompetitive platform\u201d with a panel of immobilized glycans or lectins, which are reacted in a competitive manner with labeled probes; e.g., Cy3-lectins and glycoproteins. On the other hand, basic specificities of lectins are obtained by FAC using structure-defined purified glycans without any effect of carrier protein and with less effect of clustering of glycans (they are maximally diluted). In this regard, it should also be noted that native glycoproteins consist of considerably heterogeneous glycoforms [75].",

However, there are many other chitin-binding lectins, which do not belong to the hevein family [81]. They include LysM (lysin motif), which was initially found in several bacterial autolysin proteins and is often associated with chitinase as a carbohydrate-binding module [82]. Interestingly, LysM also consists of a small number (approximately 50) of amino acids, including evolutionarily conserved disulfide bonds. It seems, however, that binding features to chito-oligosaccharides are fairly different between the two families [81].",

More diverse oligosaccharide specificity will be generated by recently developed molecular engineering strategies [83,84]. Alternatively, tandem-repeat type lectins, such as WGA and UDA, may improve their performance both in terms of binding affinity and specificity by selecting one of their repeating CRDs resulting in a \u201chomogenous\u201d tandem-repeat. It is widely believed that individual CRDs, after duplication in the course of evolution, diverge from each other and, thus, their specificities have also diverged. In this context, it is important to identify a CRD responsible for the desired specificity, e.g., affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans containing bisecting GlcNAc in WGA. So far, however, such an approach has never been made with chitin-binding lectins. Future studies necessary for this approach include practical application of naturally and artificially produced chitin-binding lectins in various fields, e.g., medical, material and food sciences. Using the information obtained in these studies will generate more precise and systematic knowledge for lectin utilization in complex life systems.",

Briefly, the above lectin-immobilized columns were connected to the FAC-1 or FAC-T and were equilibrated with TBS. The flow rate and column temperature were kept at 0.125 mL/min and 25 \u00b0C, respectively. After equilibration of the columns, either excess volume of PA or pNP-oligosaccharides dissolved in TBS were successively injected into each of the lectin columns. Elution of PA-oligosaccharides (2.5 or 5.0 nM) was monitored by fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of 310 and 380 nm, respectively), while that of pNP-oligosaccharides (2\u201360 \u03bcM) was monitored by UV adsorption (280 nm). The volume of the elution front (V) of each oligosaccharide was calculated as described previously [46,47,48]. V0 was determined for an appropriate reference substance; i.e., Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-2)Man\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-4GlcNAc-PA (003) for DSA, LEL, STL, and WGA, Gal\u03b21-4Glc-PA (701) for UDA, and 003 or Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b21-4Gal\u03b21-4Glc-PA (703) for PWM. Hence, retardation of the elution front of each oligosaccharide, i.e., V \u2212 V0, was used for determination of Kd values. Since [A]0 is, in most cases, much smaller than Kd, the equation can be simplified to be Kd = Bt/(V \u2212 V0), where Kd value is no longer dependent on [A]0.",

Bold arrows on the top denote the regions of \u03b2-strands. Schematic representations are made for each lectin on the right, where four amino-acid residues essential for chito-oligosaccharide-binding in hevein, i.e., Ser (S), two Trp (W), and Tyr (Y) are shown in each hevein domain shown with a gray box.
