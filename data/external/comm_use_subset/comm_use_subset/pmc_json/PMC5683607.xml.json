To activate the antiviral immune response, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [6, 7]. The PRRs include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs). RLRs include RIG-I [8], melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) [9] and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) [10]. RIG-I and MDA5 interact with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene (MAVS, also called IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF) [11], a critical downstream adaptor protein located at the mitochondrial membrane, via caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD)-CARD domains at their N-terminal [12]. Activated MAVS can recruit downstream interferon regulatory factor-3/7 (IRF3/IRF7) and the transcriptional factor nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) [13], leading to the rapid production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines [11, 14, 15].",

            "text": "Although both RIG-I and MDA5 are closely related, exhibiting 25% and 40% identities in their N-terminal CARD and C-terminal helicase domains [16, 17], they can recognize different types of ligands and distinct subsets of RNA viruses. RIG-I has been reported to recognize short dsRNA produced during the replication of RNA viruses and uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphate (5\u2032-ppp) ssRNA [18]. MDA5 can be activated by long dsRNA, including the synthetic dsRNA analogue poly I:C [16, 19]. Overexpression of MDA5 and RIG-I inhibits the growth of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [19], and overproduction of MDA5 but not RIG-I leads to enhanced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in measles virus (MV)-infected A549 cells [9]. It has also been demonstrated that expression of MDA5 and RIG-I resulted in the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in influenza A virus-infected epithelial cells [20]. Barber et al. suggested that the lack of RIG-I observed in chickens results in a deficiency of the antiviral innate immune response, possibly explaining the high susceptibility of chickens compared to ducks during Avian influenza virus (AIV) infection [21]. Similarly, the absence of RIG-I in chickens may contribute to the susceptibility of only chickens to IBV.",

A total of 1 \u03bcg of RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (HiScript Q RT SuperMix for qPCR, Vazyme, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, after which the transcribed products were diluted and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Gene expression was quantitated using a LightCycler 2.0 System (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Switzerland). The relative expression ratios of the target genes chMDA5, chIFN-\u03b2, chIFN-\u03bb and chMx were calculated using the \u25b3\u25b3Ct method. To assess IBV replication in ovo and in vitro, real-time PCR was performed by absolute quantitation PCR [26].\n",

The replication ability of IBV was determined by absolute quantification real-time PCR. IBV can be detected in all tissues, and the viral genome load was higher in the lung and trachea compared with other tissues (Fig. 3a). Eight housekeeping genes were selected for screening stably expressed reference genes in different chicken embryo tissues to be used in comparison to the determined cytokine expression studies (Additional file 2: Figure S1). The transcription of the antiviral cytokines chMDA5, chIFN-\u03b2, chIFN-\u03bb and chMx in different tissues was normalized using three different reference genes (Additional file 2: Figure S1). We found that variability in expression for each gene was similar when normalized to different stable reference genes (Additional file 3: Figure S2).

This similarity prompted us to investigate whether dgRIG-I has the same role as chMDA5 in the IBV-induced IFN response in chicken cells. The expression of chMDA5 in DF1 cells enhanced chIFN-\u03b2 transcription after the cells were infected with IBV compared with the control group transfected with vector and primed by IBV infection (P \u2264 0.05) (Fig. 5a). We also found that infection with IBV induced higher chIFN-\u03b2 transcription in dgRIG-I-expressing cells to a greater extent than the control group (P \u2264 0.01), and dgRIG-I induced chIFN-\u03b2 expression after IBV infection to a greater extent than chMDA5. Expression of chTLR3 did not enhance chIFN-\u03b2 transcription after being infected with IBV. These results appear to indicate that IBV stimulates chIFN-\u03b2 transcription via MDA5. Similarly, the IBV-induced chIFN-\u03b2 transcription was further increased by the overexpression of dgRIG-I. These data show that chMDA5 and dgRIG-I act as positive regulators of the IBV-induced chIFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway (Fig. 5a).\n",

RIG-I and MDA5 share a similar homology in their overall primary structure and induce the downstream signaling pathway involving MAVS [7, 11, 12]. In this study, to investigate the effect of dgRIG-I in the chicken immune system response to IBV infection, we identified and cloned dgRIG-I. We found that dgRIG-I plays a similar role to chMDA5 in upregulating the transcription of chIFN-\u03b2 in response to IBV infection. It has been previously demonstrated that IBV can delay the transcription of chIFN-\u03b2 in the early stages of infection [35]. In this study, we found that through the cleavage of the chMAVS protein, IBV can downregulate chIFN-\u03b2 transcription, and the knockdown of chMAVS had a dramatic effect on chIFN-\u03b2 activation, indicating a more predominant role of MAVS in the innate immune response against IBV infection.",

Previous reports found that expression of the chMDA5 gene could be detected in all tissues examined [22, 23, 34]. Wenxin Zhang demonstrated that IBV failed to increase the MDA5 promoter activity and the expression of endogenous MDA5, which may be explained by the differences in virulence and adaptability of the IBV strain [36]. The expression of MDA5 was significantly upregulated in chicken intestine and lung after being infected with IBV, which in turn upregulated the expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb.

They can both detect RNA viruses and activate a signaling pathway that leads to the production of type I interferon and the initiation of antiviral activities [17, 37]. Considerable attention has recently been given to the role of chMDA5 in IBV infections in chickens, which appear to lack RIG-I [34]. Our results confirm the findings that chMDA5 is the receptor that mediates the antiviral response to IBV infection. Upregulation of chIFN-\u03b2 following IBV infection in chMDA5-overexpression cells suggests that chMDA5 interacts with the proteins induced by IBV infection [25]. The silencing of chMDA5 expression resulted in a reduction of IBV-induced chIFN-\u03b2 transcription and highlights the role that chMDA5 may play in antiviral defense. The absence of RIG-I in chickens may lead to insufficient antiviral responses to IBV infections, resulting in only chickens being susceptible to IBV infections, whereas ducks and geese, which possess RIG-I, are not infected with IBV [38]. chIFN-\u03b2 was upregulated in response to IBV infection in dgRIG-I-overexpressed chicken cells, which is similar to observations made in mammalian models [23, 38]. Our study implies that dgRIG-I plays a similar role as chMDA5 in IBV-infected chicken cells, inducing the interferon response.",

Silencing of chMDA5 also had little impact on IBV replication, and a subtle role for chMDA5 may be masked by incomplete silencing of chMDA5, resulting in trace levels of IFN activity. Nevertheless, our data gave a similar result as mammalian models showing that MDA5 is not critical to combat the influenza virus [23]. It is known that type I IFNs are induced by the infection of host cells with viruses and that secreted type I IFNs cause cells to express various antiviral proteins, such as myxovirus-resistance protein (Mx) GTPase, ribonuclease L (RNase L), RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms [27]. Previous studies have suggested that IBV replication was reduced by 50%, as measured by syncytia formation, after a treatment with 100 U/ml of IFN [39, 40]. This implies that even in cells responding to type I IFN, the autocrine and paracrine effects of IFNs from virus-infected cells may not be sufficient to suppress viral replication. IBV delays the IFN response at an early stage of infection in chicken cells, since it needs time to infect neighboring cells before the establishment of an antiviral state induced by IFN [25], which is secreted paracrinely by chMDA5 and dgRIG-I mediated induction in IBV-infected cells. The data in Fig. 4 also support this conclusion, which suggests that the expression level of IFN in the group infected with a higher dose of IBV was higher than in the group that received a lower dose.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases are a manifestation of constant battles between the host and pathogenic microbes. This host-pathogen antagonism is demonstrated by the interaction between viruses and MAVS, a critical molecule that is downstream of MDA5 and RIG-I [11, 41]. For example, MAVS can orchestrate a strong immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV), but HCV counterattacks by cleaving MAVS, thus crippling the immune response [42, 43]. MAVS activity was proposed to be linked to both peroxisomes and mitochondrial location in the assembly of a macromolecular signaling complex [13]. When MAVS was cleaved and released to the outside of mitochondria, such as the endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasm, it failed to signal [13, 44]. IBV can efficiently cleave MAVS in the early stages of infection, leading to the blockage of IFN expression. Furthermore, chIFN-\u03b2 expression, induced by IBV infection, was effectively inhibited by blocking the expression of MAVS using siRNA. More significant results were observed when MAVS was silenced together with siMDA5. In conclusion, we showed that chMAVS acts as a key modulator of antiviral signaling by regulating chMDA5-mediated signaling in IBV-infected cells. Future studies should focus on more detailed aspects of host-pathogen interactions that involve chMAVS to gain control of the host immune system.",

We show that IBV induces activation of the IFN response in CEK cells and chicken embryos. We also found that chMAVS acts as a key modulator in antiviral signaling by positively regulating chMDA5-mediated signaling. dgRIG-I and chMDA5 have similar roles in the IBV-induced IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway, the absence of RIG-I may increase the susceptibility of chickens to IBV infection. The exact contributions of these PRRs and MAVS are worth exploring in future studies.",
