The characteristic clinical signs of PEDV infection are vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss [2,3]. Pigs of all ages are susceptible to PEDV infection, and neonatal piglets under 2 weeks of age have the highest mortality rates, reaching 100% [2]. PEDV was initially reported in Europe in the early 1970s, and it has spread widely to multiple swine-producing countries [4]. Since 2010, the emergence of highly virulent PEDV strains has decimated swine farms in China [5]. These strains spread to the United States in 2013, wiping out more than 10% of the pig population of America in less than a year [6,7,8]. Since then, these new high-virulence PEDV strains have repeatedly emerged in many swine-raising countries, leading to devastating economic losses to the world swine industry [4,9]. The severity of these highly virulent variants emphasizes the importance of developing an effective method to control their spread and infection.",

The S protein can be cleaved into S1 (residues 1\u2013789) and S2 subunits (residues 790\u20131386) by host protease [16]. The S1 subunit contains the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1\u2013233) that shows sialic acid binding activity and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 253\u2013638) that attaches to the cell surface receptor (e.g., aminopeptidase N (APN)) [17]. The S2 subunit mediates virus\u2013cell membrane fusion [16]. S protein is an excellent target for vaccine development for the induction of protective immunity against PEDV. Several studies have confirmed that antibodies, especially neutralizing antibodies stimulated by the vaccine expressing spike protein, are able to protect the host from PEDV infection [18,19]. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies against PEDV can be developed as candidates for passive protection. Lee et al. reported that egg yolk antibody (IgY) against S1 domain of spike protein efficiently protects neonatal piglets against PEDV, supporting the potential of antibody reagents as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent to protect piglets against PEDV infection [20].",

The single chain fragment variable (ScFv), also called single-chain antibody, is one of the most popular types of genetically engineered antibodies [21,22]. The scFv consists of a variable light chain (VL) and heavy chain (VH) that are connected by a short peptide linker [23]. The advantages of scFv are its small size, low immunogenicity, high specificity, and ability to be genetically engineered. The scFv can be produced in bacterial expression systems for large-scale production. Although scFv is smaller than full-length IgG, it retains the complete antigen binding site [24]. Several scFvs have been produced to control virus infection, including scFvs against chicken infectious bursal disease virus, scFvs targeting human influenza virus H5N1, and scFvs against the phosphoprotein of Newcastle disease virus [25,26,27,28]. Thus, scFv is considered a potential reagent for the prevention and treatment of viral disease.",

They are characterized by deletions, insertions or amino acid substitutions in the S gene, compared to the CV777 strains [4,6,37]. Even though many swine populations have been immunized with the classical vaccine CV777, it could only provide limited cross-neutralizing activity in swine populations against new variant strains, thus leading to immunity failure [38]. The strain used in the present study was isolated from piglets showing typical PED clinical symptoms. It belongs to the genotype of new variant strains, representing epidemic and pandemic field strains in China. We used this strain as an antigen to select specific porcine scFvs that could neutralize virus infection, and the prophylactic efficiency of scFvs was also evaluated.",

Neutralizing antibodies are produced in the colostrum or milk of sows, and newborn piglets are passively protected from PEDV when they suckle immune dams (lactogenic immunity) [3,40]. Although these vaccines are widely used and considered to be effective, not all sows develop solid lactogenic immunity due to the immunization route of the vaccine, and sucking pigs are still vulnerable to infection unless they obtain adequate maternal antibodies from the milk [19,41]. Additionally, this method does not provide protection to postweaned piglets. PEDV-specific antibodies are rapidly lost in postweaned piglets, and they become susceptible to PEDV. Moreover, amino acid sequence mutations in the new variant strains will cause immunization failure of commercial vaccines [42]. Based on these aspects, feeding foreign antibodies (passive immunization) to piglets is more suitable than vaccination to prevent neonatal diarrheal diseases. Egg yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) from chickens immunized with PEDV antigen has been administered to piglets, and the results showed that IgY is able to reduce mortality in piglets after challenge exposures [20]. Although IgY prepared from immunized chickens has the characteristics of high affinity, a large yield, and a simple isolation process, the production cost of high-quality IgY for large-scale applications still remains higher than that of commercial antibiotics or vaccine [43]. Since IgY is of chicken origin, it might cause immunogenic side effects in the host.",

The results showed that the variation in the complementary determining regions (CDRs) were significantly greater than in the framework regions (FRs). The lengths of CDR3 in the VL and VH were not equal among the three scFvs, indicating the presence of amino acid insertions or deletions in these regions.

This procedure may not be feasible in many cases where a single epitope is recognized, but it can be achieved when more than one epitope is recognized on the viral surface. In this study, we mixed three scFv in a cocktail to investigate whether the combination of these scFvs would have a better effect on the neutralization of viral infection compared with their use alone.

The IFA assay and additive ELISA confirmed that all three scFvs reacted with different epitopes of S1 the domain but not the S2 domain. Previous reports have shown that the main neutralizing epitopes of S protein are located in the S1 domain [47,48], and two neutralizing domains have been identified in the S1 region, including NTD/S0 [49], COE (aa 499\u2013636) [50], and S1D (aa 636\u2013789) [48]. The exact epitopes recognized by these scFvs need further elucidation by pepscan ELISAs. Previous studies have reported that the major genetic variations of PEDV are concentrated in the S1 portion of the S gene, especially in the N-terminus of the S1 gene [51]. Even a single amino acid mutation in this region can change the structure of the spike protein, which may explain why current vaccine strains fail to protect piglets from new emerging variant strains [52]. Our study has confirmed that these scFvs neutralize PEDV by targeting to the S1 domain. Whether these three scFvs also influence PEDV CV777 replication, or just specifically recognize unique epitope on the variant strain, this still need further study.",

Piglets treated with scFvs showed no to moderate diarrhea, and the intestinal mucosa remained intact under histological examination, indicating the scFvs could block the virus from invading the small intestine. The effect of scFvs is slightly influenced by the low pH and enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after oral administration. To solve these problems, biodegradable polymeric nanoparticulates such as chitosan and its derivatives that can protect proteins from degradation may be a prospective strategy for oral delivery [53].

Our results provide a basis for the development of scFv-based drugs for the treatment and prevention of PEDV-induced diarrhea.",

(a) The single chain fragment variable (scFv) obtained from the biopanning process were further analyzed by phage ELISA. An scFv that showed no affinity to PEDV antigen was used as a negative control. Three scFvs with relatively higher values were subjected to further analysis. These scFvs were designated PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35, respectively. (b) The deduced amino acid sequences of PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35 were aligned using ClustalX (version 2.1, www.clustal.org/), and the figure was produced using ESpript (espript.ibcp.fr/). The dots (.) represent the missing amino acids. (c) The PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35 gene sequences were ligated into the expression vector, and the secreted recombinant antibody was purified using Ni-NTA resin and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Lane M: protein molecular weight marker; Lane 1: purified PZZ 21; Lane 2: purified PZZ 24; Lane 3: purified PZZ 35. (d) Purified scFv PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35 were further confirmed by western blot analysis. A mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody was used as the primary antibody. Lane 1: PZZ 21 induced by IPTG; Lane 2: PZZ 24 induced by IPTG; Lane 3: PZZ 35 induced by IPTG; Lane 4: PZZ 21 not induced by IPTG; Lane 1: PZZ 24 not induced by IPTG; Lane 6: PZZ 35 not induced by IPTG. (e) PZZ 21, PZZ 24, and PZZ 35 bound to PEDV-infected cells. PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells were incubated with PZZ 21, PZZ 24, or PZZ 35 at 24 h post-infection and then stained with the FITC conjugated anti-His monoclonal antibody. PEDV-infected cells stained with anti-N PEDV polyclonal antibody were used as the positive control. Stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope.",

The fecal consistency was scored as follows: 0, normal feces; 1, pasty feces; 2, semiliquid feces; 3, liquid feces. (b) Piglets orally administered scFvs survived after PEDV infection. Animal survival was observed for 10 dpc. The log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test was used to calculate statistical differences between each group, and p < 0.01 was considered a significant difference. (c) Fecal samples were collected using cotton swabs and used to extract viral RNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using primers targeting the PEDV N gene. The detection limit was 3 log10 copies/mL, and values lower than the detection limit were considered to denote negative samples. (d) Small intestinal tissues were collected from piglets at 5 dpi. The tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The stained sections were observed by light microscopy at 400\u00d7 magnification.",
