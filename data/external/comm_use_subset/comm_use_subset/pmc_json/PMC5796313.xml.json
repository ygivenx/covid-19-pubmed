Due to their low cost, effectiveness, and convenience for field-based point-of-care detection, the paper microfluidic devices are excellent analytical tools, especially in electrical power-deficient underdeveloped countries [3,4,5,6]. Recently, even more advanced versions of the paper devices have been introduced by combination with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic substrates, or with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [7,8]. In addition, two-dimensional and three-dimensional paper devices have been reported [3]. Glassy carbon and conducting polymer-based multidetection of human blood ions has been introduced [9]. However, direct detection of blood ions is still difficult and simultaneous detection of major human blood ions is even more challenging, because of the many other interfering materials, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, proteins, and hormones. These biological and chemical blockers coexist in the blood stream, and effectively screen precise detection of the ions [10,11].",

Optimization and characterization of the wax patterns are conducted in terms of potentiometric sensitivity and response time. The major human blood ions, including Cl\u2212, K+, Na+, and Ca2+, are physiological indices as indicators of human body disorders. Thus, an accurate determination of blood ions is of great importance to assess whether numerous metabolisms and homeostasis in the human body are working correctly.",

One is to prepare paper channels, another one for reference and sensing electrode wells, and the other one for salt bridges connecting each reference and corresponding sensing electrode pairs, respectively. Note that waxed areas are shown in black. Four reference electrode areas that are supposed to be soaked with different composition of solutions are isolated from each other and from the sensing electrodes area. Sample solution for sensing electrodes may be dropped down right above the center circle and flowing through the assigned paper-based microchannels. To create the paper channels, the solid wax-patterned Whatman filter paper (grade 1, 180 \u03bcm, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) is treated at 130 \u00b0C for 45 s, allowing the melted wax to penetrate deep inside the porous cellulose paper by capillary action. Biocompatible solid wax patterning of the paper is performed with a laser printer (Fuji Xerox, Tokyo, Japan). Each electrode well has the same size (4.5 \u00d7 4.5 mm), except the sensing electrode well (2 \u00d7 2 mm) for the detection of chloride ion, which does not need any ion permeable membrane. The reduced well size slows down the fluid flowing speed in the chloride ion sensing channel to be similar with the flowing speeds in the other channels. Note that detection of K+, Na+, and Ca2+ ions requires specific ion-permeable membranes, which commonly hinder the free movement of solutions in the channel. The hydrophobic wall-mounted paper electrode substrate by wax printing is combined with one-sided or double-sided adhesive poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET, Copierland, Seoul, Korea) films. Figure 2d,e show the top and the second top PET cover films. The top layer has five round shaped holes: one for loading a sample solution (~150 \u03bcL); the others for loading reference solutions (~50 \u03bcL each). Four rectangularly shaped holes are prepared for electrical connection to external circuits. The second layer is engraved with the same patterns of the underneath wax-patterned paper and superimposed on the paper layer. By combining with the top layer, the second layer provides a small volume of empty space right above the paper channel, which enables faster transfer rates of reference and sensing solutions. Note that punching of the PET film is performed with a laser cutter (Silhouette, Orem, UT, USA).",

The hydraulic radius (rH) defined as rH = A/P (where A is the fluid channel\u2019s cross-sectional area, and P is the wetted perimeter of the channel) indicates that the hydraulic diameter of the regular triangle is about 58%, as compared with those of the circular or the regular square, because the hydraulic diameter is defined as four times the rH. This means that the pressure force of a sample solution loaded through the triangle inlet acting on unit surface area is larger than the others, assuming a constant sample volume. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a higher fluid flow rate with the triangle inlet and a higher Reynolds number (Re), which is defined as Re = (DH\u03c1v)/\u03bc, where v is the fluid velocity (m s\u22121), and \u03c1 and \u03bc are the density (kg m\u22123) and viscosity (kg m\u22121 s\u22121) of the fluid, respectively. However, a turbulent flow in a microchannel is unobtainable, because typically the flow within such a small channel restricts Reynolds numbers to between 10\u22125 and 10\u22123, so a laminar flow may govern the entire fluid flow [14]. Additionally, boundary layers between fluid streamlines are not available due to the porous paper channel, and a plug flow will be dominantly observed. In conclusion, the sample inlet shape does not appreciably affect the fluid flow mechanism in the paper-based microchannel as shown in Figure S1. Circular inlets were chosen for convenient loading of the sample solution. ",

Because the salt bridge acts as an ion source for neutralizing each half cell electrolyte, it should only contain highly concentrated ions. In this work, the salt bridge area acts not only as the electrical connector but also as an actual mixing area for loaded solutions coming from both solution inlets. This means that a thick diffusion layer will be formed in the mixing channel, and the steeper concentration gradient commonly observed with a wider mixing area will show higher zero current potential. The potential difference between the Ag/AgCl electrodes would decrease and eventually disappear, provided that each layer component of the paper microfluidic device was airtight, and the ions inside were freely moved to reach an electrochemical equilibrium state.

Basically, the surface modification processes are categorized into two major groups, which are oxygen plasma-based physical treatments and chemical treatments by the use of bifunctional chemicals, such as 3-aminopropyl dimethyl ethoxysilane (APDMES) [16]. Even though the physically prepared hydrophilic surface shows a relatively short lifetime, the oxygen plasma treatment is widely used, because the plasma-induced chemical functional groups on the target surface are delocalized over the entire surface [17,18]. However, the use of oxygen plasma to modify hydrophobic wax walls in a paper cellulose-packed environment is ineffective. Instead, APDMES treatment of the paper device by dipping is utilized in this work, and results are obtained that are comparable with the plasma treatment. Figure S4 shows different signal output patterns of non-treated, oxygen plasma (O2 Plasma Cleaner, Femto Science Laboratory, Seoul, Korea)-treated, and APDMES (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI, USA)-treated PAD channels.

While the reference solution for Cl\u2212 detection is 1 M KCl, the concentration of KCl in the sensing solution varies from 0.01 to 1 M. The sensitivity of chloride anion is \u221247.71 mV decade\u22121 (R2 = 0.9968), 21.6% less than the theoretical 59.2 mV decade\u22121 that is probably due to the distorted electrochemical behavior of the screen-printed Ag/AgCl electrode. The Ag/AgCl electrode is prepared by heat curing of the screen-printed silver ink and low purity of the screen-printed silver causes the sensitivities to be lower than that expected by the Nernst equation. The deviation becomes smaller as the ion concentrations near the two Ag/AgCl electrodes come closer [12]. The available detection range of chloride anion is relatively small as compared with previous data [19]. However, the calibration curve shows a short response time and a linear response in the range. For the calibration of potassium, 10\u22123 M KCl is used as the reference solution, and the linear concentration range of KCl in the sensing solution is between 10\u22123 and 1 M. The measured potentiometric sensitivity to K+ is 45.97 mV decade\u22121 (R2 = 0.9973), 22.3% less than the theoretical value. In the case of sodium, the reference solution is 1 M NaCl, and the linear concentration range of NaCl in the sensing solution is between 10\u22123 and 1 M. The measured response to sodium ion is 51.06 mV decade\u22121 (R2 = 0.9912), 13.7% less than the theoretical value. The sensitivity of the device to calcium cation is 19.46 mV decade\u22121 (R2 = 0.9916) in a linear range between 10\u22123 and 10\u22121 M of CaCl2, which is 34.1% smaller than the theoretical value. Note that the calcium ion is a doubly charged cation, and the theoretical zero current potential increases 29.6 mV per decade concentration increase of Ca2+. The paper device presented in this work shows a wide linear detection range available for the direct analysis of physiologic human blood ions, because the normal concentration ranges of Cl\u2212, K+, Na+, and Ca2+ in human serum samples are 98~109 mM, 3.5~4.9 mM, 138~146 mM, and 1.12~1.32 mM, respectively [20].

However, the potentiometric signal output of the device for human serum ions is not exactly the same as that determined by commercial clinical equipment. This means that a correlation curve is needed for connecting the two measurement systems.
