Western blot analysis confirmed that all gene products show bands at expected molecular weights. Notably, the large band that is observed in all blots in Fig. 1b is due to non-specific binding as it was also detected in an un-transfected cell control (data not shown).",

As expected, empty vector control (pcDNA) and pS\u2206TM failed to produce any anti-S1 IgG isotype. On the other hand, plasmid DNA expressing S1 subunit (pS1) induced a balanced Th1/Th2 response (IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of ~1.0) with S1-specific Abs from all isotypes. While IgG2a and IgG2b levels induced by pS1 were significantly higher compared to pS\u2206TM and empty vector control (pcDNA), no significant difference was observed in the levels of these two isotypes between pS and pS1-vaccinated groups. In contrast, level of S1-specific IgG1 Abs elicited by pS1 vaccine was significantly elevated compared to all groups including pS group. Collectively, compared with the full length S protein, these data suggest that S1 subunit delivered by DNA vector elicited stronger antibody responses and equal ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 whereas the full length S protein induced a Th1-skewed immune response.",

Remarkably, immunization of mice with pS vaccine did not elicit any significant levels of IFN-\u03b3 compared to control group (pcDNA) after re-stimulation with S291 peptide (Fig. 3). On the other hand, re-stimulation of CD8+ T cells from pS1-vaccinated animals induced significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 compared to all other groups, suggesting that immune-focusing by using S1-based vaccine could not only enhance Ab response but also cell-mediated responses. The inability of pS immunogen to induce S1-specific CD8+ T cells IFN-\u03b3 was consistent with the overall weaker response compared to pS1-vaccinated group. Interestingly, re-stimulation with several other peptides within the S1 subunit as previously described32 failed to elicit any IFN-\u03b3 from all groups (Supplementary Figure 1).",

As shown in Fig. 4, sera collected from mice immunized with DNA expressing full-length S protein or S1 subunit were found to have comparable nAb titers against the human and the camel isolates.

Most of these experimental vaccines were based on MERS-CoV full-length or truncated versions of the spike protein; these prototype vaccines were found to have induced high levels of nAbs and sometimes conferred protection against MERS-CoV challenge in several animal models. However, several previous SARS-CoV vaccine studies have also shown that there might be some safety concerns associated with the use of WIV43, truncated S subunit/protein vaccines44 or vectored vaccines expressing full-length S protein45. These concerns included inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as eosinophilic infiltration of the lungs as well as Ab-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in immunized animals upon viral challenge. It is believed that induction of Th2-polarized immune response and/or non-neutralizing Abs against epitopes within the S protein (i.e. outside the neutralizing-epitope rich RBD or S1 subunit) are the reason for the observed immunopathology and disease enhancement in vaccinated animals464748, suggesting that use of S1 subunit over full-length S protein could be a safer option for vaccine development.",

Up to date, only two studies have investigated MERS-CoV DNA vaccines by utilizing full-length S protein, which is the primary target of immune response in the host. To dissect the antigenic domains of the S protein, we examined the immunogenicity of naked DNA vaccines expressing several versions of MERS-CoV S protein in mice. We found that pS-immunized group elicited significant IgG2a and IgG2b titers (Th1-skewed response) with very subtle S1-specific CD8+ IFN-\u03b3 response. On the other hand, pS1-immunization generated markedly increased levels of all IgG isotypes in a balanced Th1/Th2 response along with low but significantly elevated CD8+ IFN-\u03b3 response compared to pS group. While further animal studies are required to determine whether induction of balanced Th1/Th2 or Th1-biased immune response could aid in the development of safer MERS-CoV vaccine, S1-based vaccines could be a safer option compared to the full-length S-based vaccines.",

In addition, the observation that both pS1 and pS induced similar nAb titers (Fig. 4) suggests that full-length S protein harbors neutralizing epitopes outside the S1 region as previously reported29. The induction of high levels of IgG1 by pS1 vaccine and consequent balanced Th1/Th2 response could probably be explained by the secretion of S1 subunit especially that this immunogen contains the signal peptide without the cell membrane anchoring domains compared to pS vaccine. While additional studies are required to confirm this, we have previously shown that internal viral proteins such as the influenza nucleoprotein could be partially secreted and alter the immune response phenotype when fused to a secretion signal50. Furthermore, the weak or undetectable response in pS\u2206TM and pS\u2206CD immunized mice is noteworthy especially that Wang et al., showed that MERS-CoV DNA vaccine expressing S\u2206TM induced limited response in mice even after electroporation29. Although this response could be due to misfolded protein and rapid degradation of the antigen, or low expression level of these truncated spike proteins given that expression of S\u2206TM gave low production yields from transfected HEK 293 as previously described29, similar vaccines have been shown to be very effective in mice in the case of SARS-CoV52.",

Most previous studies utilized strains such as Jordan-N3 (GenBank ID: KC776174.1) and EMC/2012 (GenBank ID: JX869059.2) in live virus neutralization assay. These viruses were isolated in 2012; they may or may not be same as the currently circulating strains, given that strains used here showed 5\u20137 and 1\u20132 amino acid changes in comparison to Jordan-N3 and EMC/2012, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2). Furthermore, several other studies have used pseudovirus neutralization assay to test contemporary strains which may not replicate the actual neutralization breadth against live viruses2930. It is of note that the similar levels of nAb titers in both pS and pS1 groups reported here appear to be different from the observation by others, who found significantly higher levels of nAbs induced by a DNA vaccine expressing full-length S protein compared to that expressing S1 protein29. However, this discrepancy in results remains to be fully understood but is likely due to the difference in experimental conditions. Specifically, Wang et al. utilized electroporation with DNA immunization and pseudovirus neutralization assays to determine nAbs whereas we used naked DNA vaccines and live virus neutralization assays.",
