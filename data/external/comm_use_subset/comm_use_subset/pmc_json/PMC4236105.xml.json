Now, studies show that camels are a likely primary source of the MERS-CoV that is infecting humans [4], [5], [6]. But the routes of transmission between camels and people which is the key point to stop transmission of the virus, is far from clearly understood. The continued threat of MERS-CoV necessitates the development of an effective vaccine.",

Besides, they are often prone to degradation. Hence, they call for efficient delivery systems and potent immunostimulants, jointly denoted as adjuvant(s) to evoke the desired antigen-specific immune response phenotype enabling successful vaccination [12].",

Another classic adjuvant is that based on a water-in-oil-emulsion formulation, such as incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (IFA). Recently, researches have focused on adjuvants that signal through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [14]. Cysteine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which activate B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR9 and induce both innate and adaptive immunity, are currently being developed as a vaccine adjuvant [15]. Another frequently used adjuvant is polyriboinosinic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic dsRNA that mimics the effects of naturally occurring dsRNA, a TLR3 agonist [16], [17].",

For example, ppolarized Th1-type immunity can be achieved by the addition of Freund\u2019s adjuvant or CpG DNA to an antigen. On the other hand, Th2 antibody responses can be induced by the Alum, as indicated by increased IgG1 relative to IgG2a [18], [19]. However, in situations where both Th1 and Th2 responses are required for protection, the choice of one regimen over another might be counter effective. This has led to additional research for alternative adjuvants or adjuvant combinations that promote balanced mixed Th1/Th2 responses [18].",

Adjuvants without rRBD did not elicit a clear cellular response in the spleen 2 weeks after the third immunisation (Figure 5A). Neither RBD/A nor RBD/A+P induced a significant cellular immune response. In contrast, RBD/A+C and RBD/I+C regimen enhanced a detectable systemic cellular immune response. Furthermore, the RBD/I+C regimen induced the greatest cellular immune response with the greatest number of IFN-\u03b3\u2013producing cells in the spleen (p<0.05). A significant cellular immune response in the lung was induced only by the RBD/I+C regime, although a few IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were detected in all immunised mice (Figure 5B).

Therefore it was proposed that vaccination with the RBD of MERS-CoV, which belongs to the same betacoronavirus genus as SARS-CoV [27], [28], might also inhibit MERS-CoV infection and induce a neutralizing antibody response against MERS-CoV. Du et al [8] identified a recombinant protein containing a 212-amino acid fragment (residues 377\u2013588) in the truncated RBD of MERS-CoV spike protein fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) was able to induce in the vaccinated mice strong MERS-CoV S-specific antibodies, which blocks the binding of RBD to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the human MERS-CoV receptor [29] and effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infection. Besides, they [9] showed that residues 377 to 662 in the S protein of MERS-CoV induced significant neutralizing antibody responses, suggesting that this region had a potential to be developed as a MERS-CoV vaccine. Mou et al [10] showed the polyclonal antibodies in rabbits against the RBD in the S protein to a 231-amino-acid fragment (residues 358 to 588) efficiently neutralized virus infectivity. However, none of the studies evaluated the immunogenicity of rRBD protein systematically in an animal model. Recently, Ma et al [7] ssuggested the possibility of developing a recombinant RBD protein containing residues 377\u2013662 into an effective and safe mucosal MERS vaccine through the intranasal route in the presence of the only Poly(I:C) adjuvant in a mouse model. While the need for vaccines with the ability to generate an effective immune response has led to the combination of antigens with more than one adjuvant, the \u2018Adjuvant System\u2019 approaches. The Adjuvant System approach aids in the development of vaccines that generate effective immune responses [11], [30]. In this study, the roles of three adjuvants\u2013alum, IFA, CpG and poly (I:C)\u2013in rRBD subunit vaccination were investigated aimed at inducing an effective immune response through use of tailored adjuvant combinations and delivery routes.",

However, a more robust immune response was elicited when mice were immunised with the RBD/A+C and RBD/I+C regimes. An unexpected result was the absence of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of RBD/I+C immunised mice, despite anti-RBD specific IgG titres being similar for the RBD/I+C and RBD/A+C regimes. To further understand the riddle, we detected the aantibody avidity of different vaccination regimes by aavidity ELISA. However, the results showed the high antibody avidity correlated with a high IgG titre in mice of RBD/I+C and RBD/A+C groups. So, we speculated maybe the adjuvants of destroyed the conformation of rRBD and covered the antigen binding sites. Another probable cause of the low titer of neutralizing antibodies in the sera of RBD/I+C immunised mice was the delivery route of subcutaneous. As known, the subcutaneous may be associated with degradation at injection site, which leads to decreased bioavailability [31]. Whatever, further studies are in process.",

To characterise the immune response of the different vaccination regimes, IgG isotype including IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b analyses were performed. As expected, the RBD/A regimes produced a Th2 response with high IgG1/IgG2 ratio. In contrast, mice received the RBD/A+C or RBD/I+C regimes revealed a Th1 skewed response. Consistently, the RBD/A+C or RBD/I+C regimes induced a systematic cellular immune response in mice by ELISpot analysis. The high level of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the CBA was also a proof of the cellular immune response in mice. Besides, the mice in the RBD/A+C group had a high level of IL-4 and IL-10, which were an index of Th2 skewed response. Taken together, the RBD/A+C induced a Th1 and Th2 mixed immune responses, though the responses had a Th1 inclination. It was our original intention of mixed Th1/Th2 responses for better protection. Similarly, the RBD/I+C regimes induced a mixed Th1 and Th2 responses. However, it was a pity that the RBD/I+C regimes could not induce an effective neutralization antibody, which was the most important factor of a prophylactic vaccine.",

It indicates that the combination of alum and CpG was the optimal strategy for i.m. rRBD antigen delivery in a murine model. This result will facilitate future MERS-CoV vaccine design. The results of the present study also support the importance of the Adjuvant System approach, although adjuvant combinations do not always produce the desired response, as seen with RBD/I+C. Consistent with the results of the present study, CpG plus alum was found to induce protective humoral, as well as cellular immunity, in mice immunised with a recombinant haemagglutinin vaccine that protected against influenza virus challenge [32]. The ideal immunity of the CpG and alum combination may be the result of mutual complementation of these two adjuvants. It is well known that alum can promote antibody-mediated protective immunity. However, alum is a poor inducer of cellular immune responses [12]. Recently, adjuvants including oil-in-water emulsions have shown improved efficacy for avian influenza protection suggesting that even for diseases where humoral immunity can confer protection, cellular immune responses may be necessary in vaccine design [33]. The key features of CpG-ODN used as a vaccine adjuvant, include the ability to elicit Th1 cell, but only under certain conditions, CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses and an additional ability to divert the pre-existing Th2 response in neonates and elderly mice toward a Th1 phenotype [34].",

Except for a choice of adjuvants in combination with optimal protective antigen, practical items such as the antigen: adjuvant ratio, dose, vaccination regimen and often route of administration will strongly impact on both the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine formulation. In most cases, an experimental vaccine will be initially tested in an animal model [29]. To evaluate the immunogenicity of rRBD protein thoroughly, it is necessary to test the protective effects of rRBD subunit immunisation in an animal model of MERS-CoV infection. To date, rhesus macaques have been reported to generate pneumonia-like symptoms within 24 h of MERS-CoV infection [35], and we are testing the effects of rRBD immunisation in rhesus macaques. Considerable efforts are being made to establish a small animal model of MERS-CoV infection. Though the lung cells of the Syrian hamster express the receptor for MERS-CoV, they are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [35], [36]. Recently, a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection was reportedly generated by transduction of mice with adenoviral vectors expressing DPP4 [24]. In the future, we expect the protective effect of the RBD/A+C vaccination should be investigated in this murine model of MERS-CoV infection.",
