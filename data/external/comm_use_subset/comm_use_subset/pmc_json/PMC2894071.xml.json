            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), also called \u201cblue ear\u201d disease due to a typical, but not often observed hallmark of \u201cblue ears\u201d, is widely accepted as being one of the most economically important diseases affecting swine industry. Since its first appearance in the late 1980s in the US and Europe, PRRS has spread worldwide [1], [2], [3]. PRRS is characterized with high mortality in piglets, reproductive failure (late-term abortions and stillbirths, premature farrowing, mummified pigs) in pregnant sows and respiratory disease (interstitial pneumonia, respiratory difficulties) in nursery and grower/finishing pigs, causing highly significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide, resulting in >$ 560.32 million losses each year in the US alone [4]. The etiologic agent of PRRS is PRRS virus (PRRSV), a small enveloped, linear, single, positive-stranded RNA virus, which is a member of the family Arteriviridae which includes lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, equine arteritis virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus and enters in the newly established order of the Nidovirales together with the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae family [5]. Since the initial PRRS outbreaks in mainland China in 1996 [2], the PRRSV has spread widely and the infection rate of some swine herds is up to 90% [6], [7]. In June 2006, a so-called \u201chigh fever\u201d pig disease large-scalely emerged in China, studies showed that highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV (H-PRRSV) is the major causative pathogen [8], [9], [10]. However until recently, all PRRSV isolates, including H-PRRSV isolates in China, were identified as the North American type PRRSV (NA PRRSV) genotype [6]. Since 2006, the classical NA PRRSV (N-PRRSV) and H-PRRSV strains coexist in China [6]. PRRSV replicates predominantly in the alveolar macrophage of the lung, can induce prolonged viremia, and cause persistent infections that last for months after initial infection [11]. Infected pigs develop a strong and rapid humoral response but these initial antibodies do not confer protection and can even be harmful by mediating an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), since these antibodies can facilitate the entry of the virus into targets cells in vitro. In contrast, induction of neutralizing antibodies (NAs) is severedly delayed and their levels remain low, which can not eliminate effectively PRRSV-infected cells [12], [13]. Because of these features of PRRSV infection, PRRS has been one of the most challenging subjects of research in veterinary viral immunology [12].",

            "text": "Regulation of immune responses and genetic resistance to infectious viral diseases is an area of concern for human and swine [14]. PRRSV strongly modulates the host's immune responses, and changes the host's gene expression. Studies showed that PRRSV inhibits type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, SPI IFN), especially IFN-\u03b1 [15], and induces interleukin-10 (IL10) [16], [17]. Because the primary cellular target of PRRSV is the porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) of the lung, several studies have analysed the immune responses of PAMs to PRRSV infection. One group [18] used differential display reverse-transcription PCR to identify molecular genetic changes within PRRSV-infected PAMs over a 24 h pi period. Their results suggest that myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) and ubiquitin specific proteases (USP) genes may play important roles in clinical disease during PRRSV infection. Notably, one recent paper on genome-wide transcriptional response of PAMs following infection with the Lelystad PRRSV strain (European type, EU PRRSV) using Affymetrix microarrays has been published during the preparation of our manuscript [19]. They found that the expression of beta interferon 1 (IFN-\u03b2) was strongly upregulated while the expression of IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 was weakly upregulated. Almost in the same time, the other group employed Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to examine the global expression of genes in VR-2332 PRRSV strain (North American type, NA PRRSV)\u2013infected PAMs. They identified over 400 unique tags with significantly altered expression levels [20]. In vitro studies will be useful for investigating how PRRSV modifies genes expression in primary target cells, such as PAMs. However, many of the outstanding issues will be answered only in the context of PRRSV-infected animals. Hence, the characterization of host immune response under in vivo environment to PRRSV is still an area in urgent need of investigation. Lung pathogenesis is a major feature of PRRSV infection. Moreover, in addition to serving as a source of protein in the human diet, the pig is also an excellent biomedical model for humans because of the similarity in size and physiology, and in organ development and disease progression [14]. Thus, understanding the host's immune response to PRRSV infection is important not only for swine production but also for human consumption. However, to date, the immune response to PRRSV in porcine lung has not been analyzed by transcriptome profiling. Next generation high-throughput sequencing technology has been adapted for transcriptome analysis because of the inexpensive production of large volumes of sequence data [21], [22], [23], [24]. The technology developed by Illumina (formerly Solexa sequencing) [25], which is also referred to as Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling, allows identification of millions of short RNAs in a sample and of differentially expressed genes without the need for prior annotations.",

The relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N-PRRSV infection and infection pathology was systematically analyzed. The comprehensive analysis of the global host response induced by N-PRRSV suggested an inflammatory response, mediated by multiple inflammatory molecules early during infection that induced tissue injury, an immunosuppressive state, mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection. Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N-PRRSV infection, developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance/susceptibility to PRRS.",

All pigs were PRRSV-seronegative determined by ELISA (HerdChek PRRS 2XR; IDEXX Laboratories) and absence of PRRSV tested by RT-PCR. Pigs were randomly assigned to two groups in the experiment and raised in isolation rooms. Six pigs were inoculated with 6 ml viral suspension (4 ml intranasally and 2 ml intramuscularly) of classical North American type PRRSV (N-PRRSV) strain CH 1a, isolated from China in 1996, gifted by Dr. Zhang Guihong, South China Agricultural University) at a dose of 106.0 TCID50 ml\u22121 on day 0. Three uninfected negative control (UNC) pigs were treated similarly with an identical volume of DMEM culture media from uninfected MARC-145 cells 1 day prior to experimental infection, and were immediately necropsied. N-PRRSV-inoculated pigs were clinically examined daily and rectal body temperatures were recorded from days \u22122 to 7 pi. Viral re-isolates were performed after the pigs were killed. The infected group showed positive, and the UNC group was negative. Tissue homogenates and serum were examined by N-PRRSV-specific Quantitative PCR (QPCR). The oligonucleotide primers used were NSP2F(5\u2032-GTGGGTCGGCACCAGTT-3\u2032) and NSP2R(5\u2032- GACGCAGACAAATCCAGAGG-3\u2032), designed in the gene segment encoding for NSP2. The TaqMan probe, 5\u2032 FAM-CACAGTTCTACGCGGTGCAGG -TAMRA 3\u2032, was synthesized. Three infected pigs randomly chosen were necropsied at each time point of 96 h pi and 168 h pi.

Since the model profiles were selected independent of the data, the algorithm can then determine which profiles have a statistically significant higher numberthan genes assigned using a permutation test. This test determines an assignment of genes to model profiles using a large number of permutations of the time points. It then uses standard hypothesis testing to determine which model profiles have significantly more genes assigned under the true ordering of time points compared to the average number assigned to the model profile in the permutation runs.

We select random samples of  ( is the number of genes assigned to the same model temporal expression profile r.) genes at each iteration and compute Fisher's exact test p-values for the selected genes in all GO biological categories [30]. The two-sided Fisher's exact test p-value for a category reflects a test of the null hypothesis that the category is enriched in genes assigned to profile r with respect to what would have been expected by chance alone. To decide whether or not to follow up a category that appears enriched in these genes, we would know the statistical reliability of the apparent enrichment. To assess the significance of a particular category, we need to know the distribution of p-values that would occur by random chance. The percentage of false positives to be tolerated will generally depend on the relative costs of false positives and false negatives in whatever follow-up study is to be done. This way of framing the question leads us to specify the false discovery rate (FDR) for a set of categories, rather than significance level (p-value) for each category. With the significance at the 0.05 level, for a given category, the enrichment  is given by  where  is the number of genes assigned to profile r within the GO category of interest, m is the total number of genes within the GO category of interest, and N is total number of unique genes in the gene reference database list.",

We obtained approximately 6.9 million total sequence tags per library with 515885 distinct tag sequences. Prior to mapping these tag sequences to reference sequences, we filtered adaptor tags, low quality tags and tags of copy number  = 1, producing approximately 6.6 million total clean sequence tags per library with 179589 distinct clean tag sequences. The C library had the highest number of both total sequence tags and distinct sequence tags; this was followed by the N168, N96 libraries. Moreover, the C library had the highest ratio of number of distinct tags to total tags and the lowest percentage of distinct clean high copy number tags. The data showed that more genes were detected in the C library than other two libraries and more transcripts were expressed at lower levels in the C library. Saturation analysis of capacity of libraries showed that new emerging distinct tags were gradually reduced with increasing of total sequence tags when the number of sequencing tags was big enough. When the number of sequencing tags reached 3 million, library capacity approached saturation (Figure S1).",

We obtained 194664 total reference tag sequences with 172119 unambigous tag sequences. Considering polymorphism across samples, tolerances were set to allow one mismatch in each alignment. By the criteria, 47.71%\u223c51.04% of distinct clean tags mapped to the Unigene virtual tag database, 39.42%\u223c42.11% of the distinct clean tags mapped unambiguously to the Unigene, and 52.29%\u223c48.96% of the distinct clean tags didn't map to the Unigene virtual tag database (Table 1). The occurrence of unknown tags was probably due to the incompleteness of pig genome sequencing. Most Solexa experimental tags matched to the 1st or 2nd 3\u2032 CATG site in high-confidence transcripts (Figure S2). For solexa sequencing can distinguish between transcripts originating from both DNA strands, employing the strand-specific nature of the sequencing tags obtained, we found evidence for bidirectional transcription in 6368 to 8271 of all detectable Unigen clusters and 3889 to 4043 antisense-stand specific transcripts (Table S2). By comparison, the ratio of sense to antisense strand of the transcripts was approximately 1.7\u22361 for all libraries. This suggests that in spite of the high number of antisense mapping events detected, the transcriptional regulation in the N-PRRSV-induced immune response acts most strongly on the sense strand. To analyze the depth of transcriptome sampling in the DGE libraries, we studied the rate of increase of the number of genes (sense+antisense strand) identified as the size of the corresponding library increases. When the library size reached one million, we could identify 45% and 30% all genes and genes identified by unambigous tags, respectively (Figure S3).

Data were presented as fold changes in gene expression normalized to the HPRT1 gene and relative to the C sample. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) showed that both the DGE and qPCR data (pooling samples) were highly correlated, for the genes modulated by N-PRRSV had a high consistency and r values ranging from 0.781 (CYP3A88) to 0.997 (AECC) between the two methods (Figure 2). qPCR analysis (both pooling samples and independent RNA extractions from biological replicates) confirmed the direction of change detected by DGE analysis. This correlation indicated the reliability of DGE results.",

The ultimate goal of QTL studies is to identificate the actual gene(s) that are responsible for the phenotypic variation observed in a particular trait [31]. In the present paper, we mapped the DE genes to pig QTL regions of health traits in pig QTLdatabase (PigQTLdb). Our search found that 240 DE genes were distributed in 18 different known QTL regions related to pig health traits (Figure S5; Table S5). Among the 240 DE genes, 122 and 114 were located in QTL regions of the CD4-Positive Leukocytes and CD2-Positive Leukocytes, respectively; 53 were distributed in the QTL region of the Band-Formed Neutrophils and CD8-Positive Leukocytes. Immune responses against pathogens depend in part on the generation of fully differentiated \u2018killer\u2019 (or effector) and memory CD8+ T cell. Effective priming and maintenance of CD8+ T cell responses to viral infection require \u2018help\u2019 from CD4+ T cells, the latter play also a critical role in programming CD8+ T cell memory development [32]. Moreover, recent study showed that CD4+ T cells guide effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to virally infected tissues where they can destroy infected cells [32], [33].",

After recognizing the PAMPs, either surface or intracellular PRRs trigger intracellular signaling cascades that results in the activation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs). As shown in Figure 4A, transcripts of the Toll-like PRRs TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, were significantly increased in N-PRRSV-infected pigs at days 4 through 7 pi, but no change in TLR3 which specializes in the recognition of viral dsRNA was detected. Cytoplasmic PRRs (Figure 5A), retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I, DDX58) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), the two most relevant for defense against viruses, were expressed at a high level after N-PRRSV infection. Cell surface PRRs such as CD14, MD-2 protein (MD2) and CD163 (which is probably involved in PRRSV entry during uncoating [42]) were likewise up-regulated expression after N-PRRSV infection (Figure 5A). After binding to N-PRRSV viral PAMPs, PRRs initiate intracellular signaling cascades that activate transcription factors, including IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, but not IRF3 and STAT1, STAT3, STAT6 (Figure 5B). Activated transcription factors and STATs in turn induce the transcription of specific sets of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [34], [43], and expression of multiple inflammatory genes [44], which induce a pro-inflammatory response and attract cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to sites of infection. Accordingly, we observed significant increase of transcript abundance in many genes involved in ISGs (Figure 5C), pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL1\u03b2, IL8) (Figure 5D), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10) (Figure 5E), adhesion molecules (VCAM, ICAM1, SELL), and other inflammatory molecules (such as MMP-2,) (Figure 5F). Moreover, immunoglobulin (such as IGG2B, IGG3) (Figure 5G), three categories of Fc receptors and mannose receptor C1 (MRC1) (Figure 5H), and complement proteins (Figure 5I) were also significantly induced in the N-PRRSV-infected lungs. However, several complement inhibitors that possess inhibitory and/or decay-accelerating acitivity, such as decay-accelerating factor CD55, complement component 4 binding protein, alpha (C4BPA), C4BPB, were significantly repressed in the N-PRRSV-infected lungs (Figure 5I).",

CD8+ T cells activation require T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize cognate antigenic peptides for presentation on MHC class I molecules displayed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) [32]. Accordingly, we observed that transcript abundance of ubiquitin specific peptidase (USP) and ubiquitin enzyme (Figure 6A), 16 proteasomes, and aminopeptidases (Figure 6B) was significantly increased in N-PRRSV-infected lungs. The transcript abundance of B2M, MHC class I antigen 2 (SLA-2), SLA-3, TAP2, and chaperones (such as GRP78) was markedly increased after infection with N-PRRSV while the transcript abundance of SLA-B was significantly decreased (Figure 6C). In addition to recognization of cognate peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, CD8+ T cells activation needs also to receive \u2018costimulatory\u2019 signals and help by helper CD4 T+ cells [33]. As shown in Figure 6D and 6E, 8 cathepsins and 5 MHC class II antigens were significantly induced in N-PRRSV-infected lungs. The transcript abundance of costimulatory molecules (such as CD86, ICOS), CAMs, and TCRs/CD3 complex as well as co-receptor molecules (such as CD8A, CD8B) was remarkably increased after infection with N-PRRSV (Figure 6F and 6G). Activated CTLs release perforin (PFR) and granzymes, which two effectors act collaboratively to induce apoptosis of target cells. As shown in Figure 6H, PRF1 and granzyme B (GZMB) transcript abundance was significantly elevated in N-PRRSV infected lungs relative to UNC lungs. In addition to cytotoxins released from CTLs, the transcript abundance of other pro-apoptotic members (Figure 6I), such as NFKBIA, growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein alpha (GADD45A), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (BID), XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1), cytochrome c (CYCS), CASP10, was also significantly increased after infection with N-PRRSV, which can induce apoptosis of virus-infected cells. In addition, we also identified the upregulated expression of cytochrome b245 heavy chain (GP91-PHOX), a critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), and the downregulated expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) during N-PRRSV infections, which might result in the oxidative stress response and subsequent oxidative damage of tissues (Figure 6J).",

Infections of N-PRRSV viruses resulted in fever and inflammatory response, as indicated by high expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes and receptors, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL8, SELL, ICAM, CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, B2M, proteasomes, cathepsins. This was compounded by cell death and elevated expression of NFKBIA, XAF1, GADD45A, perforin, granzymes, and cytochrome c, coupled with increased ROS-mediated oxidative stress, as indicated by by up-regulation expression of cytochrome b245. Taken together, the N-PRRSV infections may have resulted in an excessively immune and inflammatory response that contributed to tissue damage.",

Histopathology examination showed interstitial pneumonia in lungs with thickening of alveolar septa accompanied with infiltration of immune cells [46] (Figure 1). Although great efforts have been made by many researchers, the molecular basis of N-PRRSV infection is largely unknown. Here we report on the first genome-wide host transcriptional response to N-PRRSV infection using Solexa/Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) system, a tag-based novel high-throughput transcriptome deep sequencing method. Given the nature of the methodology of Illumina's DGE system, we have pooled biological replicates from three pigs for each group to make representative samples for deep sequencing analysis. We could reach a sequencing depth of 6.3\u20137.9 million tags per library (Table 1) and found over 5000 genes to be differentially expressed during N-PRRSV infection processes (Table S3). Although others studies have also pooled biological replicates for library construction and deep sequencing [47], [48], resulting in the lack of biological replicate, one may blur the impact of variations in pooling samples. Because of the variations of pigs in response to PRRSV infection, it is possible that one pig could significantly affect results without independent libraries. But we performed the qPCR validation both on the same pooled material that was used for deep sequencing and on independent RNA extractions from each pig, which all confirmed the direction of change detected by DGE analysis (Figure 2).",

We also identified many interesting genes that had not been linked to PRRSV infection in previous studies. For example, transcript abundace of lipid metabolism-related genes including APOB48R, APOE, PIK3C, was significantly increased during N-PRRSV infection processes. Alterations in lipid metabolism, perhaps including those with significant upregulation in this study, have been observed in response to infection by a range of viruses including SARS-CoV, HCV, influenza A virus, or dengue virus [35], [36], [49], [50]. Although In vitro studies have investigated how PRRSV modifying genes expression in PAMs [18], [19], [20], many of the outstanding issues will be answered only in the context of PRRSV-infected animals [51]. Hence, we characterized the genome-wide transcriptome response to PRRSV infection in porcine lung by deeping sequencing. But studies of transcript abundance in lung tissues have also their intrinsic limitations. For example, the transcriptome of lung tissues is actually a merging transcriptional responses of a wide range of cell types, some of which are infected, some of which are responding directly to the infectious process and others of which are bystanders. Moreover, increased cellularity of tissues may be confused as biologically important increased transcript abundance. Despite such limitations, our DGE study offers a broad, system-wide window into molecular processes that regulate gene expression and also provides new leads for functional studies of candidate genes involved in host-virus interaction, as illustrated in this paper.",

            "text": "The induction of expression of type I interferons (IFNs; including IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) is a well-known innate antiviral immune reaction in the virus-infected cells [52], [53]. However, N-PRRSV infection suppressed SPI IFN gene expression and decreased the transcript abundance of IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 3A). Previous studies [19], [54], [55], both in vitro and in vivo, have also showed that PRRSV elicited only a minimal IFN-\u03b1 production or even suppressed it's expression. The suppression of SPI IFN, in particular of IFN-\u03b1, is probably a crucial step in the pathogenesis, because IFN-\u03b1 has been shown to inhibit PRRSV replication [11]. Other viruses infection, such as the 1918 influenza virus [56], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [57], Ebola virus [58], also suppressed type I IFN gene expression which led to extensive viral replication and increased pathogenesis. IRF3 plays an important role for type I IFN gene expression. The transcript abundance of IRF3 was decreased intensively in N-PRRSV-infected pigs by 168 h pi (Figure 4B). One study [59] indicated that PRRSV NSP1\u03b2 inhibited IRF3, and then down-regulated IFN-\u03b2 gene expression. It is worth mentioning that the NSP1 of the influenza A can also suppress innate immunity by inhibiting IRF3 activation, and subsequently disrupting the induction of \u03b1/\u03b2\u2013interferon [60]. Research has indicated that the expression of CD163, a PRRSV receptor [61], on macrophages in different microenvironments, in vivo, may determine the replication efficiency and subsequent pathogenecity of PRRSV [62]. Transcript abundance of CD163 was significantly increased after N-PRRSV infection (Figure 5A). The internalization of PRRSV via CD163 in the target cells may induce the expression of IL10, and in turn induce the expression of CD163 on neighboring undifferentiated monocytes and increased overall PRRSV susceptibility [62].",

Other chemokines such as CCL2 (also known as MCP1 ), CXCL9, CXCL10 (also known as IP10), which were significantly increased (Figure 5D), may be also crucial for lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration into the sites of N-PRRSV infection. CCL2, IL8 and IP10 expression were upregulated during SARS-CoV [70], [71], and murine coronavirus [72] infections process, which may recruit monocytes and/or macrophages to sites of infection and be a major cause of lung pathology. Although the present study indicates that upregulation expression of pro-inflammatory molecules contributes to the pathogenesis of N-PRRSV, increased transcript abundance of anti-inflammatory molecules, such as IL10, PGE2, was also detected in the study. Upregulation of IL10 gene expression was found previously in PRRSV-infected porcine leukocytes, PAMs, DCs, and in vivo in PRRSV infected pigs [16], [17], [19], [73]. Perhaps an increase in pro-inflammatory molecules followed by increased anti-inflammatory molecules is the normal progression of events in inflammation [74]. The upregulation expression of IL10 might skew the immune response away from a protective Th1-cell response towards a non-protective Th2-cell response, therefore impairing clearance of virus, which benefits viral infections [51]. Upregulation expression of anti-inflammatory molecules and pro-inflammatory molecules occurring concurrently was also observed after SARS-CoV and FIPV infection [75], [76]. Antibodies might also contribute to immunopathogenesis through increasing the uptake of virus by macrophages, resulting in activation of these macrophages and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Antigen-antibody complexes might increase transcript abundance of complement (Figure 5I), which leads to generation of the classical inflammatory response through the production of potent proinflammatory molecules [77]. Furthermore, complement activation might also contribute to the development of pulmonary edema and oedema of the eyelids. Further understanding the roles complement plays in the host-pathogen interactions may help to develop more effective pharmacological agents against infection. Moreover, damage to the lungs of N-PRRSV-infected pigs seems to occur directly by viral destruction of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells and macrophages (Figure 1C), as well as indirectly through production of immune mediators.",

Transcript abundance of PFR1 and granzymes increased in the lungs of N-PRRSV infected pigs (Figure 6H). Pro-apoptotic molecules XAF1, BID, cyto c, CASP10, AIFM2, were significantly up-regulated after infection with N-PRRSV, which may induce apoptosis of virus-infected cells (Figure 6I). Simultaneously, we also observed upregulation expression of anti-apoptotic genes in N-PRRSV infected lungs, including BCL2A1, MCL1, CHFR, NFKB, ADM, IL10 etc (Figure 3D). Upregulation expression of anti-apoptotic genes and pro-apoptotic genes occurring concurrently after N-PRRSV infection seems in contradiction of each other. However, this may reflect a balance between apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Perhaps PRRSV actively induces an anti-apoptotic state to complete its virus replication cycle through delaying cell death while induces apoptosis of virus-infected cells after completion of virus replication to increase rate of spread of virus [19], [78], [79]. Anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic activaties were also observed in PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells, in which PRRSV stimulated anti-apoptotic pathways early in infection while caused apoptosis of PRRSV-infected cells late in infection [80], [81]. Infection with N-PRRSV also increased transcript abundance of NFKBIA (Figure 6I), an inhibitor of the TNF receptor activated transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Loss of NF-\u03baB activity has been shown to increase the cytotoxic effects of TNF which resulted in increased cell death [82]. An increase of transcript abundance in pro-apoptotic genes might result in disruption of the mitochondria transmembrane potential, thereby inducing release of cyto c from mitochondrial membranes to induce apoptosis and secondary necrosis [83].",

Apoptosis of infected cells causes immune suppression by two mechanism: apoptosis either induces a decrease in the numbers of immune cells that compromises both the innate and adaptive immune response in which they are unable to eradicate the primary infection, or impairs immunity by inducing immunosuppressive effects in the surviving cells [88]. For example, uptake of apoptotic cells by normal macrophages and DCs stimulates immune tolerance by inducing the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10, and suppressing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [89]. Histopathological analysis of the lymphnodes of pigs infection with N-PRRSV revealed a profound depletion of immune cells compared with those of UNC (data not shown).",

After infection of macrophages and possibly DCs, PRR-PAMP interactions triggered signaling cascades that increased the transcript abundance of multiple inflammatory molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes that induce a pro-inflammatory response, activate and recruit immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, to sites of infection for virus elimination and thereby produce the clinical symptoms of viral infection, such as fever, dyspnoea, interstitial pneumonia in lungs. Further, antibodies and complement activation might exacerbate inflammatory response. N-PRRSV might induce an immunosuppressive state, mediated by apoptosis of infected cells, which caused depletion of immune cells and induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine response in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection.",
