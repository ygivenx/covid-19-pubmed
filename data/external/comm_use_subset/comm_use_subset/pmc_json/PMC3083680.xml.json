            "text": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) affects both adolescents and younger children. AR may be regarded by parents as an irritation rather than as a significant disease and is often under-diagnosed and under-treated [1]. It is now recognized that AR is made up of more than the classic symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal obstruction. AR is associated with impairments in how patients function in day-to-day life at home, at work, and in school [2,3]. Patients may also be bothered by sleep disorders, emotional problems, impairment in activities, and social functioning [4]. As allergic AR is one of the most frequent diseases encountered in clinical practice, the cost implications to society are enormous [5].",

Oxidative stress has been incriminated as one of several mechanisms that have induced toxic effects in different organs due to enhanced production of oxygen free radicals. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpene glycoside. It is a major active constituent of licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) and has been attributed numerous pharmacological effects like anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-tumor, antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities [10,11]. Recently, Glycyrrhizin has been reported with many immunomodulatory effects such as decreasing the recurrent attack rate of AR and asthma, improving semen quality with treatment [12], and modulating allergic inflammation in a murine model for asthma [13].",

[14] demonstrated that Glycyrrhizin significantly reduces OVA-induced airway constriction, airway hyperreactivity to methacholine and decreases lung inflammation including marked eosinophil infiltration in the mouse model of asthma. In addition, it reduces OVA specific IgE levels in serum and Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5 in BAL fluid. Glycyrrhizin has been proven to have an important potential in activating certain immune functions, such as induction of IFN production, augmentation of NK cell activity and modulation of the growth response of lymphocytes through augmentation of IL-2 production [15]. Dai et al. [16] investigated the effects of glycyrrhizin on the production of IL-12 and other cytokines, and found that it enhanced both IL-12 messenger RNA accumulation and protein secretion by peritoneal macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide.",

The solution was filtered again to eliminate albuminoid substances. After this time the solution was acidified gradually with sulfuric acid (20% v/v) step-by-step until no precipitation occurred. The yellow precipitate (\u223c27 g) was separated by centrifugation and was re-dissolved in a small amount of ammonium hydroxide, then its volume was adjusted to 290 mL with distilled water. The precipitation procedure with sulfuric acid was repeated. The precipitated material was rinsed several times with water in order to neutralize the sulfuric acid. The pasty, acid insoluble precipitate was dried at 40 \u00b0C and then ground as fine powder. The obtained sample was analyzed with HPLC and the purity of the resultant glycyrrhizin was 93%.",

Units of SOD activity were expressed as the amount of enzyme required to inhibit the reduction of NBT by 50% and the activity was expressed as U/mg protein. Activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was determined according to the method of Lawrence and Burk [22].

Studies conducted earlier with glycyrrhizin have shown it to counteract CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity with the anti-oxidative potential [32]. As a major component of licorice root, glycyrrhizin consists of glycyrrhetic acid and two molecules of glucuronic acid. It has been shown that glycyrrhizin and its biologically transformed metabolite called 18 \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, an aglycon component of glycyrrhizin, inhibit the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and skin contact inflammation in mice models of contact hypersensitivity [33].

            "text": "The treatment of animals with glycyrrhizin significantly ameliorated GSH content with concomitant decrease in MDA. It can be suggested that glycyrrhizin has established antioxidant properties that might have counteracted the oxidative injury in AR mice by effectively scavenging and blocking the conjugation of reactive intermediates to GSH, as evident from ameliorated GSH content and decreased MDA formation in a dose dependent manner. Concomitant decreases were observed in GPx, CAT, TAOC and SOD activities in AR mice. Treatment with glycyrrhizin and Lycopene led to significant increases in the above mentioned enzymes. Our results indicated that the use of glycyrrhizin in the therapy of AR allows oxidative stress to be abolished or reduced by correcting the antioxidant system. It is evident from the results that glycyrrhizin induces a variety of enzymes; phase II enzymes involved in the detoxification and excretion of carcinogenic or toxic substances and other antioxidant enzymes responsible for maintaining a balanced state between free radicals/oxidants and the antioxidants within the cellular environment. In addition, blood IFN-\u03b3 level was markedly reduced, while IL-4 level increased in AR mice. Treatment with glycyrrhizin led to a significant increase of IFN-\u03b3 level and decrease of IL-4 level in medicine-treated mice. IFN-\u03b3, or type II interferon, is a cytokine that is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumor control. Aberrant IFN-\u03b3 expression is associated with a number of autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases [39]. Interleukin-4, abbreviated IL-4, is a cytokine that induces differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells. Upon activation by IL-4, Th2 cells subsequently produce additional IL-4. It has many biological roles, including the stimulation of activated B-cell and T-cell proliferation, and the differentiation of CD4+ T-cells into Th2 cells [40]. Treatment with glycyrrhizin may induce Th1 cells differentiation, maturation and IFN-\u03b3 production. In addition, it reduced lgE synthesis possibly by inhibiting Th1 cells differentiation, maturation and IL-4 production, subsequently prevented AR development. Likewise, Lycopene increased IFN-\u03b3 level and decrease IL-4 level in medicine-treated mice. Lee et al [41] reported that Lycopene reduced the increased levels of IL-4 in OVA-challenged mice. This is in agreement with our results. Lycopene reduced the increased levels of GATA3 mRNA in OVA-challenged mice. This suggests that lycopene treatment is a novel, selective way to simultaneously suppress GATA-3 and increase T-bet expression in asthmatic reactions in vivo [42]. In the human body, glycyrrhizin is hydrolysed to glycyrrhetinic acid, which has a triterpenoid structure that is similar to the hormones of the adrenal cortex. Recently, research has shown that glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase, which is responsible for converting cortisol\u2014the active form\u2014into its inactive metabolites. Thus, inhibition of the enzyme by glycyrrhetinic acid significantly increases the levels of cortisol and also stimulation of the glucocorticoid receptors. This in turn potentiates the action of hydrocortisone, the main glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex. Hydrocortisone is associated with, and accounts for glyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid\u2019s antiinflammatory, anti-allergic and anti-arthritic effects, and also its role in stimulating the adrenal cortex after steroid therapy [43\u201345]. Fangzhibiyan tablets (produced by Guangxi Yunling Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) can effectively alleviate patients suffering from AR. Glycyrrhizin is an important functional component in the tablet [46]. In short, treatment with glycyrrhizin may be considered as a therapeutic option in AR patients by, for example, increasing the antioxidant capacities, counteracting the oxidative injury and/or improving the control of the inadequate inflammatory and immune response.",
