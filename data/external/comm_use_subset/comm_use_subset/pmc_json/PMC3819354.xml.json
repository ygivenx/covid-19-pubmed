            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease of humans, caused by negative-strand RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza present global health problems involving morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes, based on 2 viral surface proteins\u2013hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Almost all possible combinations of HA and NA have been isolated from aquatic birds, poultry, and other avian species. In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses were the cause of the first lethal human infection in Hong Kong [1], [2], [3]. This constituted the first identified transmission of an avian influenza virus directly from avian to human. The HPAI H5N1 virus in Hong Kong consisted of the HA gene that was derived from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like virus (H5N1; GS/GD/1) and 7 other viral gene segments derived from A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97-like virus (H6N1; W312) [4], [5]. The GS/GD/1-linage viruses have been circulating with frequent reassortments, and one genotype, named type-Z, of 8 new H5N1 genotypes generated by reassortment became dominant in 2002 [6]. Since 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses have spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, and have infected humans who have been exposed to infected poultry [7], [8]. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene from isolated HPAI H5N1viruses formally identified over 30 distinct sub-clades of the virus [9], [10]. A recent study showed that clades 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and several second- and third-order groups from clade 2 have not been detected since 2008 or earlier [11]. The World Health Organization reported that the HPAI H5N1 virus has infected 620 individuals, causing 367 deaths (\u223c59% mortality) as of 15 February 2013 [12].",

In 2011\u22122012, over 300 human cases of influenza A H3N2 variant virus (H3N2v) were reported [14]. H3N2v infection has been associated with exposure to swine at agricultural fairs in North America. The H3N2v contains the matrix segment of the viral gene from A/H1N1pdm [15]. These reports indicated the possibility of the occurrence of a pandemic through similar events. If this mutated HPAIV was to acquire the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission with high pathogenicity in humans, it might pose a serious threat to human health and the global economy.",

            "text": "Immunochromatography (IC), an antigen-detection assay completed within 20 minutes, is an important rapid test for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of influenza viruses [16], [17]. IC is quick and easy to use, but has a relatively low sensitivity. The specificity is >90%, whereas the sensitivity is approximately 60% [18]. In addition, IC is based on an antigen-based principle, liked enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), meaning the low sensitivity of IC could be due to low activity of the antibody to the antigen, such as HA protein which is frequently mutated. Improvement of the sensitivity and reactivity of IC would make this technique an important tool in the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus. This study establishes specific antibodies for detecting influenza virus HA of the H5 subtype and shows that IC can be improved using antibodies conjugated with fluorescent beads (Fluorescent immunochromatography; FLIC). Although the FLIC strip has to be scanned by a fluorescent reader, the sensitivity is significantly improved. In addition, our combination of antibodies can detect a broad spectrum of H5 subtype influenza A viruses. Thus, FLIC is expected to provide new strategies for initial diagnosis of the human transmission of HPAI H5N1 viruses to humans.",

This indicates that the sensitivity of IC would have to be improved. Additionally, IC is based on an antigen\u2013antibody reaction, implying that it is not suitable for detecting emerging or re-emerging influenza viruses that are precursors of epidemics or pandemics.
