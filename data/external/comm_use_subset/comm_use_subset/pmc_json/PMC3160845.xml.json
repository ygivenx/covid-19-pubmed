Many countries use sentinel surveillance systems to ascertain rates of medical consultations associated with influenza-like illness [1], [2], and these data typically track the influenza epidemic curve although they cannot provide information about absolute infection rates without additional data on sensitivity and specificity over time. Serological surveillance can permit robust estimates of incidence rates in a population, although it can be costly and has rarely been employed in the US. To date the literature only contains one serological study of influenza infection in the US during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [3]. Under a number of assumptions, sentinel surveillance data can be combined with virologic surveillance to estimate infection rates using a multiplier-type approach [4].",

The idea is that different infections generate different distributions of symptom profiles for symptomatic individuals, and data on reported symptom profiles can be \u201cdeconvolved\u201d to estimate the underlying incidence of various infections. For example, among children with acute respiratory illness (ARI), fever is predictive of influenza virus infection (hereafter referred to as influenza) as the etiology [5]. The proportion of febrile cases among individuals with ARI during a time period when influenza incidence is high is expected to be greater compared to the time period when influenza incidence is low. Data on symptomatic and febrile cases in age-stratified random population samples combined with an estimate of the proportion of influenza cases who develop fever can therefore potentially be used to infer influenza incidence during various time periods. More generally, using data on symptom profile distributions combined with symptom data collected through surveillance, one can estimate the symptomatic incidence attributable to each infection; the latter estimate is obtained using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm [6], [7]. Similar considerations, though involving different estimation methodology for symptoms and causes of death appeared in [8].",

Additional data on the proportion of individuals with each infection who are \u201casymptomatic\u201d (do not exhibit any of the specified profiles) can allow one to estimate full incidence (symptomatic and asymptomatic incidence of the corresponding infection). For influenza, various estimates of the asymptomatic fraction exist in the literature [9], [10], [11]. A separate study tailored for the specific population and the circulating influenza strain should render a more accurate estimate of the asymptomatic fraction.

Such surveillance (e.g. [22]), combined with estimates of the distribution of symptom profiles for symptomatic influenza cases may, in principle, render an accurate estimate of the influenza incidence curve via the deconvolution process. We have proposed a collection of symptom profiles to be used in the deconvolution process, suggested how the corresponding symptom profile distributions can be estimated from data and tested the robustness of our method by numerical simulations. We wish to point out that while we restricted our methodology to influenza-like symptoms, it could in principle be adapted to estimation of incidence of other types of diseases (e.g. enteric infections), particularly if the infection of interest has a profile of symptoms which largely sets it apart from other related infections (similarly to the presence of fever, which is much more common for flu than for other respiratory infections).",

Estimate of the flu incidence is particularly sensitive to an estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution because there are many more symptomatic non-flu cases compared to the number of symptomatic flu cases in a survey, so a misattribution of a certain percentage of non-flu cases to flu is magnified relative to the flu data. Since the distribution of symptom profiles for non-flu cases may be specific to the given population, we propose to consider a time period in the surveillance data when very little influenza circulation is known to have taken place and use the symptom surveillance data for that period for an estimate of the symptom profile distribution for non-influenza cases. In this way, large sample size for the surveillance data would also ensure a more accurate estimate of the non-flu symptom profile distribution. Additionally, larger samples increase the size of the symptomatic counts attributable to influenza both in absolute terms and also relative to the noise in such counts attributable to non-flu cases, further improving the accuracy of the deconvolution process.",

The symptom profile distribution of these infections might be different from the overall distribution for symptomatic non-flu cases. One way to deal with this is to include this agent into the list of infections whose incidence is estimated through the deconvolution process. Alternatively, one may stick with flu and symptomatic non-flu cases as the two infectious profiles and use the excess fever approach (symptom profiles given by equation (2b)). The latter might still be robust because fever is much more common for flu than for non-flu cases and excess fever attributable to flu when flu circulation is sufficiently high should be larger than excess fever attributable to the potential difference in the probability of fever given non-flu symptoms during different time periods. This issue is examined through simulations in section S3, where a large non-flu outbreak with \u201catypical\u201d symptoms is added as an unobserved component (Figure S3).",

Here for illustration purposes we have used data from [12] on RT-PCR positive household contacts recruited when a household index influenza case sought medical care. It is known that the accuracy of the PCR test is correlated with symptom presentation [23]. While three RT-PCR tests were administered on each household contact in [12], it is possible that some infected household contacts have tested negative, and this group is correlated with a weaker presentation of symptoms. Due to a relatively small sample size in [12] we did not attempt to derive age-stratified estimates of the symptom profile distribution. Some difference in symptom profile distribution for seasonal influenza A and B cases is possible (see section S2), though no statistically significant difference could be detected for the small sample of cases where sub-typing was performed. We believe that larger studies involving serology may render more accurate, age-stratified assessment of the syndrome distribution for seasonal influenza.",

            "text": "We have employed the above method for the data from a seasonal influenza outbreak on the University of Michigan campus. Those estimates have several potential limitations. The survey was not initially designed for our estimation method, with its size being too small for accurate estimates of influenza incidence. Data on symptom profiles for influenza used in the deconvolution process for the University of Michigan campus is obtained from a different population in [12]. Our assumption, based on the campus medical facilities data, that the influenza outbreak has waned towards the end of the study period may not be representative of the whole University of Michigan campus. Therefore our estimates for the University of Michigan outbreak are mostly given for illustrative purposes. A careful study design should be used to avoid some of those issues. Such design should perhaps involve the recruitment of a large number of individuals (larger than what is needed for a weekly survey) with a commitment from them to complete a certain number of surveys when prompted during the study period. The latter should decrease the correlation between the weekly symptom reports and increase the percent of weekly recruits who fill out a report, taking away from the recruitment bias when participation might be correlated with symptom presentation. Finally, serologic data if available could validate the syndrome-based estimation of infection attack rates.",
