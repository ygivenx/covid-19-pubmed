The degree equals the number of proteins with direct interactions with a given protein, which represents local centrality. The shortest path between two proteins is the shortest route that contains the least number of proteins and the interactions between them in the network. The betweenness centrality counts the ratio of the shortest paths between two proteins in the network that passes through given proteins, representing a global centrality. The average degree, average shortest path, and average betweenness centrality of all proteins in the human PPI network were 18.39, 2.63 and 2.49 \u00d7 104, respectively, whereas these values for the EIPs were 19.89, 2.70 and 1.28 \u00d7 104, respectively (Fig. 3b,c and d). The significance of the differences between the average degrees and average betweenness centralities of the EIPs and all proteins were tested using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test at the 1% significance level (p = 3.53 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 5.83 \u00d7 10\u22123, respectively), although the average shortest path lengths were not significantly different. The higher degree indicated that the EIPs were the proteins with the most interactions, whereas the lower betweenness centrality indicated that the EIPs were not central in the global human interactome. Considering the small number of identified EIPs and the slight differences, the credibility of the conclusions needed further verification.",

We divided the EAPs into four groups according to their interacting viral proteins to analyze their enriched Reactome pathways (Supplementary Tables S4\u2013S8). For the EAPs associated with the capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3), the enriched pathways were mainly the TGF-beta-SMAD signal pathways (Supplementary Table S8). By contrast, the viral 2B protein-associated EAPs were involved in more widely distributed pathways, including the cell cycle G1, S and M phase-related pathways, immune system-related pathways, such as activation of NF-kappa B in B cells, class I MHC-mediated antigen processing and presentation and inflammasomes, signal transduction pathways, such as beta-catenin-independent WNT signaling, mTOR signaling and signaling by ERBB2, neuronal system pathways, such as neurotransmitter release cycle and botulinum neurotoxicity, and other pathways, such as HIV infection, ubiquitin-dependent degradation and apoptosis regulation (Supplementary Table S4). Most of these pathways also closely interacted with viral protein 3A. Additionally, the 3A-associated EAPs were enriched in DARPP-32 events, transmembrane transport of small molecules and lysosome vesicle biogenesis pathways. Viral protein 2C-associated EAPs were involved in relatively fewer types of pathways, which primarily included neuronal system pathways, such as botulinum neurotoxicity and acetylcholine neurotransmitter release cycle, and metabolic pathways, such as metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins (Supplementary Table S6). The viral protein 3C-interacting proteins and their neighbors were primarily enriched in the cellular response to stress pathways, such as the cellular response to hypoxia and cellular senescence (Supplementary Table S7).",

The most common experimental methods for the systematic identification of virus-interacting host factors have primarily identified viral proteins that physically interact with host proteins (virus-targeted proteins, VTPs) using Y2H screens18 or essential host factors (EHFs) using genome-wide RNAi screening1920. We systematically collected virus-protein physical interactions and RNAi screening results to determine whether the EIPs were also functional for other virus infections. Twelve out of 29 EIPs were VTPs for 11 other viruses (Supplementary Table S9), and 11 out of 29 EIPs were EHFs for 8 other viruses (Supplementary Table S10).",

Due to the relatively few genome-wide RNAi screening reports, most EIPs were reported to be EHFs of only one virus. However, RUSC2 and ATP6V0C were EHFs for two and five different viruses, respectively. The broad relationships between ATP6V0C and different viruses indicated its universally important functions during different virus infections, making it a potential broad-spectrum host target for antiviral therapies. Therefore, we validated the interaction between ATP6V0C and the EV71 3A protein and studied the function of ATP6V0C in EV71 infection. Results of the subcellular co-localization ATP6V0C and 3A in co-transfected RD cells showed that ATP6V0C and 3A co-localized primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4c). Additionally, results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that ATP6V0C interacted with the 3A protein in co-transfected RD cells(Fig. 4d). To study the role of ATP6V0C in EV71 infection, the ATP6V0C siRNA were used to downregulate the ATP6V0C gene expression and the pCMV-myc-ATP6V0C which could express ATP6V0C protein in cells were used to overexpress ATP6V0C. Results showed that siRNA targeting ATP6V0C inhibited the EV71 propagation (Fig. 4g),and that overexpressing ATP6V0C in cells enhanced the EV71 propagation(Fig. 4h).",

However, whether the drugs targeting them could be effective was unknown. To explore the potential use of these proteins as host targets, we queried DrugBank to identify drugs targeting them. Contrary to the many overlaps between the EIPs and VTPs or EHFs, few EIPs were known drug targets. Only 2 out of the 29 EIPs were targeted by only 2 drugs: NADH targeting PHGDH and HMOX2 and Stannsoporfin targeting HMOX2. NADH is an endogenous small molecule that participates in the citric acid cycle and cellular respiration. Too many proteins were recorded as targets of NADH, making PHGDH and HMOX2 non-specific. The endogenous character and non-specific targets made NADH an unsuitable drug candidate. Moreover, Stannsoporfin failed to inhibit EV71 infection in vitro. To obtain more drug candidates, we listed all drugs targeting EAPs in Supplementary Table S11. The drug candidates increased to 567 when the EIP neighbors were considered. These drugs had 743 interactions with 107 different targets; the interaction type and drug properties, such as the drug type, category, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, are also listed in Supplementary Table S11. An enrichment analysis of drug properties could help determine the drug characteristic tendencies and EAP functional features. We listed the most enriched (P < 10\u221210) drug properties in Table 1 (detailed in Supplementary Table S12). The enriched drug types were diverse and included approved, psychotropic and neurological drugs, beta-blocking agents, glucocorticoids and anti-inflammatory agents. These drugs were primarily related to inflammation control and neurological indications, which were related to EV71 infection symptoms. The drug-target interaction types were also counted and analyzed. The inhibitor, agonist and negative modulator types were the most enriched (P < 10\u22123) drug-target interaction types (Supplementary Table S13).",

Thus, one by one validation of their antiviral activities would be difficult. Ideally, we would like to identify a drug that inhibits all EIPs to block host-virus interactions. The connectivity map2122 and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)23 provided an applicable strategy for the evaluation of drug influences on a group of targets (i.e., signatures through expression profiles). The 6,100 pairs of expression profiles representing the cellular responses to 1,309 different drugs were arranged in 6,100 gene rank lists in connectivity map 2.022. These genes were ranked by expression changes due to drug interference (i.e., the genes up-regulated by drug interference were placed on top of the rank list and the down-regulated genes were placed on the bottom). GSEA based on the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K-S) statistic was used to estimate whether a group of targets (i.e., a signature) tended to appear at the top (or bottom) of the gene rank lists to determine whether the signature was universally up-(or down-) regulated by drug interference. The enrichment scores acquired by GSEA were in the range of \u22121 to 1, with negative scores indicating inhibition of the signatures and positive scores indicating activation of the signatures. Here, we used EIPs as the signature and attempted to find drugs that inhibited them. All 6,100 drug interference experiments were sorted by their corresponding enrichment scores to EIPs in ascending order (i.e., the top-ranked drug interference experiments tended to inhibit EIPs). Experiments using the same drug were checked to determine whether they were consistently top-ranked. The permutation p values estimated with 1,000,000 random rankings of the 6,100 experiments as a baseline were used to describe the significance of a drug\u2019s inhibition of EIPs. Using a permutation p < 0.01 as the cut off, 27 of the 1,309 drugs were identified to significantly inhibit EIP expression (Supplementary Table S14).",

The high local or global centralities of human proteins indicated that these proteins tended to interact with more proteins or have larger influences on signal transfer throughout the human protein interaction network, respectively. The literature analysis indicated that the tendency for viral proteins to interact with central proteins might be a general hallmark of viral proteins26. The low global centralities indicated relatively weak influences of EIPs on the whole human protein interaction network, which might result from the limitations of the tissue-specific protein library used in this study. The functional analysis of EIPs and their neighboring proteins revealed that their major functions were most likely perturbed by viral proteins during infection. These functions included the cell cycle, apoptosis, multiple signaling transfer pathways, immune system and neuronal system pathways. Some of these pathways, such as the cell cycle and apoptosis-related pathways, were closely related to virus proliferation and transmission, and some of these pathways, such as botulinum neurotoxicity, inflammasomes and other immune system pathways, might play important roles in acute infection symptoms. These results provide insights for further investigations into host-virus interactions and suggest that the proteins that directly interacted with viruses could be essential for virus replication or disease progression and thus serve as potential antiviral targets.",

The approved drugs were significantly outnumbered in the enrichment analysis of target-driven drug candidates, suggesting safe and convenient drug repositioning, although the significance may result from knowledge bias. The psychotropic and neurological drugs were enriched due to the outnumbered drug targetable neural proteins in the EAPs. Other drug properties, such as beta-blocking agents, glucocorticoids and anti-inflammatory agents, indicated possible adjuvant drugs for EV71 infection. Despite massed indirect target-driven drug candidates, few safe drugs directly target EIPs. Because drugs affect few to a large number of targets, specificities of target-driven drug candidates were different. Drugs with many targets are more likely to be elected as candidates. The EIPs PHGDH and HMOX2 are targets of NADH. While considering the fact that NADH affects hundreds of targets and dozens of pathways, it is probably a false positive prediction. We attempted to use a connectivity map, which is another powerful strategy for drug repositioning2122, to predict drug candidates with the principle that drug candidate should tend to inhibit EIP gene expression. The in vitro validation of tanespimycin\u2019s inhibition of the CPE of EV71 supported this strategy. While the other five high-ranking drugs failed to reduce EV71-induced CPE. As the fuctional importance of each EIP is different, the mere assessment of the overall expression levels of EIPs is practical but loose.

In addition, the same host protein may be pivotal for a variety of viruses, therefore, host-targeted drugs may have broad-spectrum antiviral activity33. Despite the benefits of host-targeted antiviral strategies, current therapeutic drugs against viral diseases mainly targets the viral components, especially viral enzymes34. As viral proteins interact with host factors to promote viral replication and disease process, systematically experimental identification of virus-interacting host factors and bioinformatics methods were used for building virus-host interactomes and predicting therapeutic targets29353637. Although these approaches are still in infancy, more and more antiviral molecules with reduced safety risk and low resistance induction are predicted and validated343839. In this study, public databases were used to functionally annotate EIPs and find EIPs with therapeutic values, and two drug repositioning strategies were used to predict antiviral drugs. Though imperfect, this study provides a pipeline from virus-host interaction network to therapeutic applications.
