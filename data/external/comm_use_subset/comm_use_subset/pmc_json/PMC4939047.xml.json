Traditional models of CAP pathogenesis have described this disease as resulting from invasion and growth of a single pathogen in the lung (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae as the etiologic agent); and epidemiologic studies frequently seek to identify a limited number of bacteria and respiratory viruses as the causative agents of CAP [3, 4]. However, newer models of CAP pathogenesis posit that the upper and lower airways are a complex and connected ecosystem and that CAP occurs as a consequence of disruptions in respiratory tract homeostasis [5]. Few, if any, culture-independent studies have examined associations between the clinical course of CAP in hospitalized children and samples from both the upper and lower respiratory tract.",

Competitive interactions among bacteria of the upper respiratory tract microbiota influence which species can colonize the respiratory tract and potentially contribute to pathogenesis of CAP [8\u201311]. Bacteria within the upper and lower respiratory tract microbiota can alter host immune responses and the virulence of CAP pathogens [12\u201314]. Respiratory virus infection may lead to the overgrowth of select bacteria in the upper respiratory tract microbiota, facilitate transition of bacteria into the lower airways, or promote enhanced replication of bacteria already present in the lower airways [1, 15\u201318]. Collectively, these data suggest that the composition of the respiratory tract microbiota influences the clinical course of CAP.",

Nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP), and induced sputum samples were collected from children at the Memphis, TN site. The value of respiratory tract samples for detection of bacterial CAP pathogens in children has been debated [19, 20]. Culture data from induced sputum samples have been shown to provide useful information in children with pneumonia [20] and cystic fibrosis [21]. While sputum samples have limitations, we hypothesized that they would provide relevant information regarding microbial environment of the lower airways in children with CAP [20, 22, 23]. Our overall goal was to describe the respiratory tract microbiota in children hospitalized with CAP. Specifically we sought to 1) use 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) microbial profiling to determine whether microbiota profiles differ between induced sputum and NP/OP samples from children hospitalized with CAP, and 2) identify microbiota profiles associated with CAP severity as measured by length of hospital stay (LOS) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission.",

Demographic data, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and prior antibiotic use data were collected via child/caregiver report. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure was categorized as present if smoking was allowed in the child\u2019s home. Prior antibiotic use was defined as any use of antibiotics prior to hospitalization for the current CAP episode or chronic use of antibiotics. Presence of asthma/reactive airway disease and chronic conditions other than asthma were determined by child/caregiver report. Chronic conditions other than asthma included congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, kidney, heart or liver disorder, immunosuppression, and pre-term birth. Additional data obtained through medical chart abstraction included LOS (defined as the length of time in days from the admission date, or triage date if applicable, to hospital discharge) and ICU admission. Data on vaccination for H. influenzae type B and S. pneumoniae were collected via child/caregiver report and verified primarily by obtaining vaccine records from primary care physicians and by reviewing vaccine registries. Vaccines have been shown to alter the nasopharyngeal flora [26]. Thus, children were classified as vaccinated for H. influenzae type B (yes/no) or S. pneumoniae (yes/no) if at least one vaccine dose was received prior to enrollment and verified. This study population included older children who may not have received the pneumococcal vaccine because they were either born before, or were older than, the recommended age for vaccination when pneumococcal conjugate vaccines became available.",

            "text": "We used three different approaches to describe microbiota profiles. First, we examined the distribution of the relative abundance of each taxon more frequent than 0.8 % of the microbial community (n = 22 taxa). The distributions for relative abundances were highly skewed; therefore, we identified the top quartile of the distribution within each age group. Cutoff values for the 75th percentile are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. We then created a binary variable for each sample taxon as being in the top quartile of the distribution or not. Second, we identified individual taxa that were differentially abundant in groups of samples using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LefSe) [31]. We used 2.0 as the threshold cutoff value on the logarithmic LDA score for identifying taxa that differed in abundance between comparison groups [31]. Taxa within the airway microbiota may co-colonize based on similar nutritional requirements or utilization of secondary metabolites [32]. Thus, for our third approach, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to examine relationships among the same 22 taxa identified above. PCA is a statistical method used to identify groups of correlated variables within a dataset (e.g., bacterial taxa) [33]. These subsets of correlated variables are then combined into independent factors that represent linear relationships among taxa. The factors are interpreted as reflecting underlying processes that created the observed associations. We specified an eigenvalue of one and an orthogonal rotation in the PCA. Taxa with a loading value of at least \u00b1 0.4 were retained and considered taxa of interest for that factor [10, 11, 33].",

To explore associations between measures of microbiota profiles and CAP severity, we used multivariate logistic regression. In order to identify potential confounders, we evaluated unadjusted associations between individual patient characteristics and exposures of interest (e.g., taxa identified by LefSe as differentially abundant between groups) and outcomes (i.e., LOS or ICU admission) by chi-square test, Fisher\u2019s exact test, and analysis of variance or paired t-tests as appropriate.

Factor scores from PCA were included in models as continuous variables. Models were adjusted for potential confounders if they were associated with the exposure and the outcome (P < 0.15) in unadjusted analyses [34].

In contrast, we identified individual taxa and three different community profiles (factors) in sputum samples that were associated with CAP severity. These data suggest that 1) induced sputum samples provide useful information for understanding the microbial environment of the respiratory tract in children hospitalized with CAP, and 2) high relative abundance and certain combinations of bacteria in the respiratory tract (e.g., Gram-negative taxa such as Porphyromonadaceae and Prevotella) may be linked to the clinical course of CAP in hospitalized children.",

Commensals may also produce \u03b2-lactamases that interfere with antibiotic treatment of respiratory tract infections due to physical proximity with pathogens [38\u201340]. In healthy individuals, distinct microbiota live in different body sites [41]. NP and OP samples were combined prior to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and we could not tell whether the taxa originated from an NP or OP site. Moreover, we cannot definitively determine whether our sputum samples contained predominantly lower respiratory tract bacteria or upper respiratory tract taxa acquired during sampling. However, microbiota studies indicate that: 1) the upper and lower respiratory tract form an interconnected and complex ecosystem; 2) there is erosion of the zones of demarcation that differentiate microbiota niches in diseased compared to healthy states; and 3) non-native resident taxa frequently and transiently invade interconnected body sites within the respiratory tract [5, 23, 42, 43]. Even if our induced sputum samples contained taxa from the upper respiratory tract, these taxa may still contribute to the microenvironment in the lung by production of metabolites and/or by stimulation of systemic host responses [23].",

Gram-positive Lactobacillales (i.e., lactic acid bacteria) are generally associated with respiratory health [9]. However, Gram-negative anaerobes including Porphyromonas species, Bacteroides, and pigmented Prevotella have been detected in cases of aspiration pneumonia and empyema in children [49]. When these taxa are identified in children with pneumonia, they are often found in mixed infections [50]. Prevotella intermedia, an oral bacterium, was recently shown to have synergistic effects on S. pneumoniae virulence in murine models of bacteremic pneumonia [51]. Transtrachial aspiration followed by culture has been used to identify anaerobes in 22\u201333 % of adults with CAP [52]. Thus, Gram-negative anaerobes such as Prevotella may play an important and underappreciated role in the clinical course of CAP in older children.",

Culture of S. aureus was associated with increased odds of a LOS \u22654 days [aOR 2.48; 95 % CI 1.25\u20134.90] in children 6 months to <5 years (Additional file 1: Table S3). Culture of the other bacterial pathogens from sputum was not associated with CAP severity (Additional file 1: Table S3). Thus, our data suggest that important insights can be gained by culture-independent analysis of the microbial community in sputum samples from children with CAP.",

Induced sputum samples were collected once and we could not evaluate temporal changes in the microbiota. Contamination in 16S rRNA microbial profiling and metagenomic studies has been linked previously to water- and soil-associated bacteria [53]. We did not sequence reagent controls and there was potential for contamination despite our use of molecular biology grade water and commercial kits [53]. While we cannot definitively rule out contamination, we have several lines of evidence to suggest that our data reflect the community composition of our clinical samples: 1) samples were processed in random order, PCR cycles were kept to a minimum, and PCR reactions were done in duplicate as recommended by Salter et al. [53]; 2) we limited our analyses to taxa present in greater than 0.8 % of the microbial community and did not include rare taxa in our analyses; and 3) our dominant taxa are consistent with those generally identified in studies of the human respiratory tract [11, 26, 27]. We did not calculate alpha and beta diversity measures because of concerns regarding the potential for inflation of diversity estimates due to contamination, PCR amplification, and sequencing errors on the Illumina platform [54, 55]. Our study population had high a proportion of children with asthma/reactive airway disease and other chronic conditions and our results may not be generalizable to all hospitalized children with CAP.",

For example, strategies for selectively introducing commensals (e.g., microbiota transplants) to promote optimal levels of biodiversity in the airways may emerge as effective methods for treating disease. However, more data are needed regarding the role of the respiratory microbiota in the clinical course of CAP before the translational goals of manipulating the respiratory flora for optimal health and resolution of disease can be realized. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings and to provide mechanistic insights into relationships between the respiratory tract microbiota and CAP. Future data from laboratory and prospective epidemiologic studies will facilitate the design of effective prevention and treatment strategies for CAP that maintain the health-associated homeostasis between children and their commensal flora.",
