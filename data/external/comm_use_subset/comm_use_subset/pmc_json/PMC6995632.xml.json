            "text": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a monocarboxypeptidase that degrades several substrates, of which Ang II is most relevant because of the extensive biologic effects of this peptide and the attendant formation of Ang (1\u20137), which has actions generally opposite to those of Ang II [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. ACE2 protein in its full-length form is an 805 amino-acid (AA) type-I transmembrane protein (110\u2013120 kDa) that contains an extracellular domain (AA 1\u2013740), a transmembrane region (AA 741\u2013768), and an intracellular tail (769\u2013805) [10,11]. The extracellular part of ACE2 (1-740 AA), here referred as \u201cnative\u201d ACE2, contains the catalytic domain and is fully catalytically active. In our previous studies, the administration of native rACE2 (1-740 AA) resulted in a marked increase in circulating ACE2 activity, but neither kidney nor urinary ACE2 activity increased [6,12,13].",

While markedly increased circulatory levels of ACE2 activity after native rACE2 administration are capable of effectively lowering blood pressure in models of Ang II-induced hypertension [6,7,14] or renin overexpression in the circulation [15], their use is not suitable for treatment of other forms of kidney disease. For instance, in a diabetic model with local kidney but not systemic RAS over-activity [13], long-term augmentation of circulating ACE2 activity was not sufficient to alter glomerular pathology, GFR or albuminuria [13]. These observations provide the rationale for the development of shorter forms of ACE2 with a molecular size that render them filtrable by the kidney and, therefore, potentially useful therapeutically to amplify ACE2 activity in forms of kidney disease with an overactive local RAS in the kidney [13,16].",

            "text": "ACE2 is a tissue enzyme with low levels of activity in plasma [13,17]. In urine, enzymatic ACE2 activity is substantial [12,18,19]. Two distinctive ACE2-specific bands have been reported in mice and human urine [18,19,20,21]. One ACE2-immunoreactive band, at about 100\u2013110 kD, corresponds to the expected molecular weight of native ACE2 at 110 kD [12]. This 100\u2013110 kD ACE2-immunoreactive band is likely the result of shedding from the kidney apical tubular membrane, where ACE2 protein is abundantly expressed [22,23,24]. The other ACE2-imunoractive band detectable in mouse urine is of a lower size (~75 kD) and its origin and whether or not it is active remains unclear [12]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that ACE2 variants of a shorter molecular size could be generated and still retain enzymatic activity. Accordingly, we sought to develop short ACE2 variants small enough, so that they could be filtered and subsequently re-absorbed by the kidney tubules. The kidney uptake of these small ACE2 variants, in turn, would foster Ang (1\u20137) formation from Ang II, thereby providing a novel and direct approach to target the kidney RAS, which is overactive in some forms of kidney disease, including acute kidney injury.",

At specified time points of incubation, a 50 \u00b5L aliquot was taken and mixed with an equal volume of PBS buffer containing EDTA-free inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and immediately frozen. Each of the aliquots was then used for measuring ACE2 activity using Mca-APK-Dnp substrate and to detect ACE2 protein on Western blot. For Western blot, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in non-fat dry milk (5\u20137% wt/vol) solubilized in Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary anti-ACE2 antibody [AF3437 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or Ab38888 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)] and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The specificity of the ACE2 antibodies was confirmed by the absence of any bands in Western blot using ACE2KO samples, as previously reported [12]. Bands were visualized using chemiluminescence system (Super Signal Pico, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).",

The cDNA of short ace2 was generated by PCR amplification using as a template the cDNA of the intact soluble mouse ace2 (coding amino acids 1-740). To gradually shorten ACE2, we used specific primers that determine the length of the shorter ACE2 cDNA to be amplified and have compatibility with the expression vector restriction sites (pcDNA, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The absence of mutations in the amplified cDNA was verified by sequencing. The plasmids with the inserted cDNAs of the short ACE2 variants were then expressed by transient transfection in HEK293 cells. ACE2 activity was measured in the conditioned culture medium using the fluorometric substrate Mca-APK-Dnp [7] (Supplementary Materials Figure S1). The native rACE2 that contained the full extracellular domain (1-740 AA) was used as a positive control. As a negative control, conditioned media from mock-transfected cells was used. In addition, Western blot using a polyclonal antibody raised against the entire extracellular domain of ACE2 (R&D Systems, AF3437) was used to detect the transgenes and confirm the molecular size of the over-expressed small ACE2 variants.",

It was unclear whether the lower 75 kD band was a product of native ACE2 degradation or a distinct protein. We therefore decided to examine the possibility that the 75 kD band could be a proteolytic digestion product of the 110 kD ACE2 band.

Purified native rACE2 1-740 [7] was used as a control to compare the enzymatic activities of the two short ACE2 variants. The catalytic efficiency of the two short ACE2 variants (Kcat/Km) to cleave the synthetic fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, Mca-APK-(Dnp) [7], was higher as compared to native rACE2. In fact, for the rACE2 1-619, it was four-fold and for rACE2 1-605 three-fold higher as compared to enzymatic activity of the native rACE2 1-740 (Figure 5A). Using Ang II, the natural substrate of ACE2, catalytic efficiencies [Kcat/Km (M\u22121 s\u22121)] were found to be not different for native rACE2 1-740 (1.97 \u00d7 106) and for the two shorter proteins rACE2 1-619 (1.02 \u00d7 106) and rACE2 1-605 (1.22 \u00d7 106) (Figure 5B) (n = 3\u20134 experiments for each protein).",

Following a single i.v. injection of each the rACE2 forms (1 \u00b5g/g BW) (see Methods), each had a relatively short distribution phase in the blood, followed by a longer elimination phase (Figure 6, Table 1). The distribution phase half-life of the 1-605 (58 \u00b1 24 min) was not different from that of 1-619 (19 \u00b1 5 min) and of native rACE2 (13 \u00b1 2 min).

In addition, the maximum serum activity of the two short ACE2 proteins was much higher than that of native rACE2 (Figure 6). The mean residence time was also higher for the rACE2 1-605 than for native rACE2 (p = 0.038), while for rACE2 1-619 variant the difference did not reach statistical significance (Table 1).",

One band at about 110 kD corresponded to the molecular weight of native ACE2 and was likely a product of shedding, likely mediated by the metalloprotease ADAM17 [20,30,31] from the kidney apical tubular membrane, where ACE2 is abundantly expressed [12,31]. These observations prompted us to investigate if these shorter forms of about 75 kD are enzymatically active and, if so, to design shorter ones and test them for potential activity in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that the natural ACE2 of 100\u2013110 kDa can be degraded in the urine and kidney to shorter ACE2 fragments which retain ACE2 enzyme activity. That the 75 kD ACE2 band is a result of a proteolytic cleavage of the 110 kDa ACE2 was determined by demonstrating that a recombinantly generated native recombinant, ACE2 110 kDa, can be digested by kidney and urine proteases to a shorter band of similar size to the 75 kDa ACE2 fragment that was naturally observed in the urine (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In these experiments, we were also able to ascertain that the C-terminal end is the site, which is removed from native rACE2 without a loss in enzyme activity (Figure 3). This finding is consistent with crystallographic and homology studies for human ACE2 that indicated that on the C-terminal end there is a fairly large structural portion that has non-enzymatic function [11,32].",

By contrast, in the urine, extended incubation of native rACE2 ultimately led to the disappearance of the 75 kDa ACE2 band and a loss of ACE2 activity. This suggests that, unlike the kidney, in which ACE2 truncates can prevail for an extended period of time, the urine is equipped with a repertoire of proteases that inactivate ACE2 by digesting it to small inactive fragments. We did not investigate, however, the specific proteases responsible for the cleavage of ACE2 or the cleavage site. Such studies should be done in the future.",

Using this protocol previously, we have demonstrated that lowering plasma Ang II using native rACE2 effectively mitigated an increase in blood pressure caused by Ang II administration [7]. Similar to native ACE2 [6,7], both small ACE2 variants blunted the peak increase in blood pressure after Ang II infusion which normalized faster within five minutes or less. This shows that both small ACE2 variants efficiently degrade the excess of systemic circulating Ang II, thereby enhancing blood pressure recovery. Having demonstrated the systemic effect on blood pressure, we further studied whether both small ACE2 variants have any added effect to their systemic action at the local urinary and kidney level. ACE2 is normally present in the urine, and to better assess whether there is any increase in urinary ACE2 activity after administration of the short ACE2 variants, ACE2-deficient mice were used. In contrast to native rACE2 injection, both small recombinant variants resulted in a gain in urinary ACE2 activity. L-lysine, a tubular reabsorption blocker [28,29], further increased urinary ACE2 activity, suggesting that the two short ACE2 variants are both filtered and reabsorbed by the tubules. That the short ACE2 protein variant that is taken up by the kidney is indeed enzymatically active was shown by the presence of ACE2 activity in kidneys from ACE2 deficient mice that had been injected with ACE2 1-619. In addition, kidney cortex lysates from ACE2 1-619-injected mice were able to form significantly more Ang (1\u20137) from Ang II than kidney lysates from PBS- or native rACE2-injected mice. In the aggregate, these data show that mouse short ACE2 variants are active, and sufficiently small to be filtered by the kidney and, moreover, capable of increasing kidney ACE2 activity to the extent that Ang 1\u20137 formation from Ang II is increased (Figure 10). As a limitation of this study, we acknowledge that our studies were not performed in a blinded fashion and that a potential bias in the measurements of activity of ACE2 in the urine and at the kidney level were not prevented by stratified randomization of the treated animals. In this regard, the ACE2 knockout allowed us to demonstrate urine and kidney activity after injection of our short ACE2 variants relatively easily and show that this was not the case after the infusion of native ACE2. The use of native rACE2 as a control enhances the results obtained with the novel short ACE2 variants and is a strength of our design. Even though the pharmacokinetic data show the clear superiority of short rACE2 variants as compared to the native rACE2, we caution to emphasize that this effect may be dependent on the artificial substrate used to measure ACE2 activity.",

We speculate that disease conditions where the local kidney RAS is over-active would be the natural target. Several studies using diabetic models show activation of the RAS locally within the kidney by glucose, including an increase in Ang II production [33,34,35,36]. Additional evidence comes from findings of increased RAS components in the kidney and urines from rodent models of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and in patients with DKD [16,37] and non-diabetic CKD [38,39]. There is a need for new approaches to counteract RAS overactivity that expand and improve on the existing ones which are based on blockade of Ang II formation or action. We have chosen ACE2 as a therapeutic target because this enzyme cleaves Ang II to form Ang (1\u20137) with the highest efficiency [6,26,40].",

In particular, we think that Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) may benefit from the administration of our small ACE2 variants as a way to calm down the kidney RAS, which is overactive in this clinical syndrome. The pathogenesis of AKI is complex, often involving hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic mechanisms [41,42,43,44]. Alterations in the RAS have been shown to contribute to the development of AKI and are associated with adverse outcomes both in experimental and clinical studies [45,46,47,48,49,50]. Several components of the kidney RAS, such as urine Angiotensinogen and Ang II, the main active peptide, are increased in experimental AKI caused by ischemia-reperfusion AKI [45,46,47,51,52,53,54,55,56] ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) may attenuate renal inflammation, injury and improve renal function in the ischemia-reperfusion model of AKI [57,58,59,60]. Intrarenal Ang II is reportedly elevated in AKI, which may worsen kidney tissue injury independently of its hemodynamic effect that helps maintain renal circulation [61,62,63]. Based on these considerations, we are currently studying the effect of ACE2 1-619 in a mouse model of AKI.",
