In 2004, we calculated S values for genome sequences, and found that S < 1/3 is valid for most genomes [2]. In 2008, Elhaik et al. criticized this work with 2 claims [3]. 1. S <S 1/3 is in fact a mathematical property that is always true regardless of specific data. 2. S and H (Shannon entropy) are strictly equivalent. To rebut with minimum space, I raised one counterexample to each claim [4]. 1. When a = c = 0.5, g = t = 0, S = 0.5, which is larger than 1/3; thus S < 1/3 is not a mathematical property that is always true, and it depends on specific data to be valid. 2. H, but not S, has the property of additivity of information entropy; they thus differ. Therefore, both claims are incorrect [4].",

First, not only in organellar DNA and single stranded DNA sequences, in other genomes, also, the compositions a + g and t + c are only equal approximately. Second, for those genomes that obey a more \"stringent\" PR2 rule, these compositions are still only equal approximately, but can never be assumed as exactly the same. Deviations from PR2, although small, contain critical and rich information, and these deviations differ among genomes, and they thus should not be simply disregarded and treated as 0 altogether, i.e., for genomes, S and H still should not be treated as functions of the composition of one single nucleotide A only (eq.

Variations of purine/pyrimidine and amino/keto bases (x and y components) should not be disregarded and treated as \"little use\" only because they could be small in magnitude; in contrast, they are important and useful. As mentioned above, based on x and y components, a large number of replication origins have been located in both bacterial [12,13] and archaeal genomes [14]. The x and y components play an absolutely indispensable role in Z-curve based gene finding algorithms, which have been successfully applied in recognizing protein coding genes in, to name a few, the genomes of L. interrogans Lai [25], B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 [26], B. thuringiensis BMB171 [27], A. mediterranei U32 [28], M. tuberculosis H37Ra [29], Drosophila [30], new human coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 [31] and HKU1 [32], four coronaviruses from bats [33], new phages Rtp in E. coli [34] and in a pandemic V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 strain [35].",

Both S and H are real numbers. The number of all real numbers within the interval, e.g., [0,1] is infinite. Therefore, the table that contains 'all values' cannot be saved, unless with the infinitely large computer storage, which, however, does not exist.",

A) The distribution of the mapping points in the reduced coordinate system (x, y, z) according to equation (3). The square (the side length = 2) corresponds to the projection of the regular tetrahedron onto the x-z coordinate plane. The bold and dotted circles correspond to projections of inscribe spheres with the correct radius length 1/3 and wrongly calculated value 1/4, respectively. Based on the correct radius, in contrast to their conclusion that 45% of genomes have mapping points outside the inscribed sphere, none has the mapping point outside the inscribed sphere and none has an S value larger than 1/3. B) The distribution of the mapping points in the original coordinate system (X, Y, Z) according to equation (1). The square (the side length = 3/2) corresponds to the projection of the regular tetrahedron onto the X-Z coordinate plane. Note that all mapping points are within the inscribed sphere, too, whose radius length is 1/4. The mistake of Elhaik et al. is the confusion of the original and reduced coordinate systems, and consequently, the neglect of the coordinate transform parameter 4/3. Refer to text for details.",
