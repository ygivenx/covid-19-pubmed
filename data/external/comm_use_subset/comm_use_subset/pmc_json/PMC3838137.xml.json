            "text": "An important genetic tool to study animal, positive-sense RNA viruses is the infectious clone, a form of viral genome cloned on a plasmid that can be propagated in Escherichia coli and manipulated for reverse-genetics analysis. While the tool has yielded important insights into viral infection and is critical for generating vaccine candidates, the instability of certain viral genome sequences in E. coli (especially in the cases of most flaviviruses [1] and coronaviruses [2] and of some picornaviruses [3], togaviruses [4], and pestiviruses [5]) has limited the scale of genetic analyses for these viruses. The instability is still not well understood. Consequently, each mutant construct must be extensively sequenced to verify the absence of adventitious mutations, potentially resulting in months of efforts to establish one such clone. Though there are many cloning approaches to mitigate the instability (6\u201311), a large-scale genetic analysis relying on cloning methods still requires significant efforts to establish the mutant or chimeric viruses. In addition, the cloning methods are not adept at capturing the diversity of a virus pool for manipulation and screening, hindering the application of available genetic approaches to study viruses.",

The DENV genome could be reconstructed from multiple PCR products (amplified from cDNA) in a single DNA assembly reaction. Unlike the conventional DNA ligation method, DNA assembly by Gibson assembly (12), which was used in this technique, stitches DNA through overlapping, homologous sequences at the ends of DNA fragments, thus negating any need to introduce foreign sequences to accommodate ligation and providing the flexibility of being able to join DNA at any locations on the viral genome. To produce virus from DNA, viral PCR products, amplified from viral cDNA using high-fidelity polymerase with proofreading activity, were assembled onto an expression plasmid with a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter that precisely initiated transcription on the virus genome sequence and a terminator, such as hepatitis D virus (HDV) ribozyme, that accurately generated 3\u2032 end of the transcribed viral RNA (13, 14) (Fig. 1A).",

            "text": "The ease of assembling PCR products by Gibson assembly greatly simplifies genetic engineering of viral genomes. Traditional DNA ligation relies on complementary sticky ends generated by cutting DNA with restriction enzymes. The use of restriction enzymes has limited DNA assembly from multiple PCR products, as adding restriction sites must not interfere with the functions of the sequences at the joints. The restriction sites must also be unique to specifically ligate DNA. Seamless DNA assembly techniques, such as Gibson assembly (12), In-fusion (Agilent) (18, 19), SLIC (20), and SLiCE (21), could solve this problem by generating sticky ends on any linear DNA. Subsequent annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA overhangs and ligation of annealed fragments joins the DNA in a specific manner. Similar seamless assembly, such as CPEC (22) and SHA (23), relies on the annealing of cDNA strands at the ends to join DNA fragments during PCR amplification. In principle, any of these seamless DNA assembly techniques may be substituted for Gibson assembly in the virus construction approach presented here. Very recently, CPEC was applied to construct West Nile viruses in a similar bacterium-free approach for virus construction (24). The virus construction by CPEC could achieve similar recovery of the heterogeneity of a West Nile virus stock (24). Together, these results show the applicability of a seamless technique in virus recovery.",

While the data presented here show high accuracy of reconstructing viruses by this method, the possibility of unintended mutations caused by random PCR errors cannot be ruled out when viruses are constructed from PCR products.

It can recover the genetic diversity in the virus stock (Fig. 1B and D). It significantly reduces the amount of sequence verification required in a large-scale genetic analysis through the ease of recombining viruses (Fig. 3). It enables direct genetic manipulation of a virus mutant pool (Fig. 4). By eliminating these limitations, this approach supports large-scale forward genetics (Fig. 3) and expands our current ability to mutate viruses for reverse genetics and directed-evolution experiments (Fig. 4). Its capability is based on direct exploitation of PCR products amplified from viral cDNA as building blocks to construct infectious viral DNA in a single, highly efficient reaction of Gibson assembly. The throughput capability gained will support functional characterization of virus variants, which are being discovered at a breakneck pace by next-generation sequencing. Since it relies on a DNA-based expression format applicable to many positive-sense RNA viruses, its utility will be relevant to these viruses (13, 26, 27). The technique should accelerate vaccine and antiviral-drug development to fight against many pathogenic positive-sense RNA viruses.",
