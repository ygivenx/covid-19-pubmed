All previous outbreaks combined (1976\u20132008) resulted in 2232 reported Ebola cases and 1503 reported deaths [2]. The response effort by local and international health workers and organizations resulted in control of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa by the end of 2015, but not without significant costs for both donor and afflicted countries [3]. By December 2015, the response had cost donors at least US$ 3.6 billion [2]; an additional estimated US$ 2.2 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were lost in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2015. More than 17,300 children lost one or both parents to Ebola [2]. Furthermore, access to healthcare services decreased substantially, resulting in a considerable hidden morbidity and mortality burden [4, 5].",

Many countries had invested only limited resources in health infrastructure, including human resource capabilities, lab infrastructure, and disease surveillance [9]. Consequently, it would have been difficult for local and international organizations to respond to potential active Ebola virus transmission beyond West Africa. Even with a geographically limited outbreak, delays in response efforts resulted in a higher number of Ebola cases at peak [2, 10, 11].",

On March 23 2014, Guinea reported the first cases of the West African Ebola outbreak to the World Health Organization (WHO) [17]. By May 2014, the first Ebola cases were reported in both Liberia and Sierra Leone [2, 15]. In August, WHO declared the Ebola epidemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern with a \u201cvastly underestimated\u201d death toll of approximately 1000 persons [6]. Ebola cases also occurred in Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal, but were detected and controlled due to efforts from local and international health workers and organizations [3, 15, 17\u201320]. Ebola cases were also treated in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and United States. These were mostly healthcare workers who had contracted the disease in West Africa [2]. The risk of Ebola- infected persons traveling to other countries has been highlighted by mathematical models [15, 19, 21\u201328]. The biggest risk, however, was in the ability to respond to any additional cases and outbreaks occurring outside the West African foci. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, characterized their response as \u201cthe most intensive outbreak response in the agency\u2019s history\u201d [2]. It is reasonable to question how much additional capacity existed among international health agencies to aid national health agencies with limited resources in a rapid response to yet another Ebola outbreak.",

These cities typically have limited local public health resources and emergency response capabilities. We assumed that some number of Ebola cases would occur in a country before the outbreak is detected and an effective response is initiated, and that responding to the foci in West Africa would have limited the ability of international public health agencies to rapidly aid the responses to additional Ebola outbreaks. Our estimates emphasize the need for improved levels of preparedness and response to public health threats, underscore the importance of rapid detection and initiation of an effective, organized response, and highlight some of the challenges faced by countries with limited public health systems that drove the progression of the Ebola outbreak. Based on these lessons, we produced a list of actionable items that would contribute to a rapid detection and effective responses in countries at high risk for disease transmission, thus minimizing the impact of emergence or re-emergence of infectious disease threats.",

The model, a Markov Chain, tracks patients through the following states: susceptible to disease (S), infected people incubating Ebola virus (I), infectious (I), recovered or dead (R) (i.e., a SIIR model). The model splits the patients who have become symptomatic [30, 31] into three categories of isolation: hospitalization, effective home isolation (including safe burials), and no effective isolation (the main assumptions in the model are discussed in the Additional file 2: Appendix S1).",

We based the seed numbers on two factors. First, observations from West Africa that one or two initial cases can result, due to local customs related treatment of sick persons and burial ceremonies, in several additional cases. As an example of an extreme situation, a single undiagnosed (missed) Ebola case and unsafe burial in Kono, Sierra Leone, resulted in 43 confirmed cases [33]. Further, the degree of underreporting in West Africa was estimated to be between approximately 1.5 to 3.0 Ebola cases for each reported case [34, 35]. Thus, even with 2 identified cases there are likely to be many more initially unidentified cases that represent a risk of onward transmission.",

            "text": "There are multiple factors that may affect both how quickly an Ebola case or outbreak would be detected and how fast an effective response can be initiated. These include, for example, the quality of the disease surveillance system, availability of trained healthcare workers, laboratory and diagnostic capabilities, health infrastructure, accessibility to infected patients, patients\u2019 health-seeking behaviour, available resources, competing government priorities [36\u201340]. We used three rate-of-growth scenarios to model how quickly an outbreak is contained; these scenarios were based on transmission-and-containment patterns observed in Liberia during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic [2] (Additional file 2: Appendix S2). For all three scenarios, we assumed that within the first week of outbreak detection 10% of Ebola cases would be hospitalized or effectively isolated [2, 10] (Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Figure S2). We based the \u201cLiberia-like scenario\u201d on data collected in Liberia during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola epidemic (3). We assumed a 5\u20136% increase per week in the number of cases hospitalized or effectively isolated during weeks one through 11, and a 2% increase per week during weeks 12 through 16. This resulted in 66% of cases being effectively isolated by week 15 (3). It is important to note that the Ebola outbreak response effort in Liberia included substantial support from international health workers and organizations, in addition to local response capabilities [2, 3, 16]. We built the \u201cdelayed-response\u201d (slower than Liberia) scenario by assuming a 1.5% increase per week in the number of cases hospitalized or effectively isolated during weeks one through three, and 2\u20134% increase in hospitalization or effective isolation during weeks four through 16. For our \u201cfast-response\u201d scenario, we assumed a 10% increase per week in the number of cases hospitalized or effectively isolated during weeks one through four, a 7% increase per week during weeks five through seven, and a 4% increase per week in weeks eight through 12. In this \u201cfast response\u201d scenario, the final proportion of cases in effective isolation leveled off at 81% at week 13 (Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Figure S2). We used data from Liberia because in August\u2013September 2014, Liberia experienced rapid growth in cases (doubling of cases approximately every 23 days) [41], clearly illustrating some of the challenges faced by countries with limited public health infrastructure and existing capacity for rapid response. Model parameters can be adjusted by the user; the spreadsheet-based model is available for free at http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24900.",

Higher income countries tend to have a more robust public health infrastructure, laboratory and diagnostic capabilities, and larger trained workforce per capita than lower income countries, which would presumably allow them to implement effective outbreak control measures faster [42\u201346].

For example, in an analysis of data from Montserrado County, Liberia, cases in areas with lower socio-economic status (SES) were responsible for higher numbers of reported contacts, secondary cases and wider spread to other parts of the county [51]. To account for these differences in living conditions between Monrovia, Liberia, and the cities used in the analyses, we performed two additional sets of analyses. We weighted the estimated number of Ebola cases that would occur using the ratio of: 1) each city\u2019s population density (pop/sq. mile) to Monrovia\u2019s population density (more densely populated cities would have on average more Ebola transmission), and 2) the ratio of the proportion of the population living in slums (shanty towns) at the country level to the proportion of the population living in slums in Liberia.",

For comparison, on March 2014, the WHO announced an Ebola outbreak notified by the Ministry of Health of Guinea, and Liberia reported the first Ebola cases about a week later. At the end of May, presumably knowing that Ebola was a major threat from neighboring Guinea and Liberia, Sierra Leone reported the first Ebola cases, from participants in a local funeral. Five weeks later, by July 11, there were more than 300 confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone [2]. Further details showing the unadjusted number of Ebola cases, estimated cases weighted by population density, and estimated cases weighted by population living in slums, compared to Liberia are show in the Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S6.

Our estimates illustrate the importance of building early detection and effective response capabilities. Had Ebola spread beyond Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, the number of cases worldwide could have been several folds higher than observed. The potential spread of Ebola varied greatly, largely hinging on the number of cases that occurred before detection and initiation of an effective response, and on the effectiveness of the response. Preparing for the next crisis entails examining the factors that allowed halting the outbreak in the countries where importations occurred, and analysing the main challenges in the three West African countries where Ebola spread.",

            "text": "A useful illustration of how local health systems can quickly detect and effectively respond to a rapidly evolving outbreak was the control of Ebola in Nigeria in July 2014 [3, 15, 18]. A cluster of 19 Ebola cases originated from a single traveler with Ebola who flew on a commercial airplane from Liberia to Lagos. One Ebola-infected nurse who cared for the index case apparently travelled to Enugu, over 500 km from Lagos, and one primary contact of the index case with Ebola travelled to Port Hartcourt, over 600 km from Lagos [15]. Both cases underscored the risk of rapid intra-country spread of Ebola. The Nigerian government, in collaboration with CDC and other partners, rapidly created an incident management system largely using staff from the Nigerian Polio Eradication Program and support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. An Emergency Operation Center (EOC) had been recently established in Nigeria to support the polio eradication initiatives, which had prioritized health system strengthening and emergency response preparedness. The polio EOC deputy became the Ebola EOC incident manager, and had readily access to trained staff and financial resources within the health system and from partner agencies including WHO, CDC, and Doctors Without Borders [18]. The response team identified 898 contacts who were followed-up due to potential exposure to Ebola virus; patients with suspected infection were effectively isolated in Ebola treatment facilities [15, 18]. Contact tracing efforts were supervised by experienced epidemiologists and supported by in-country laboratory testing (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and anti-Ebola virus immunoglobulin G diagnostic tests). This rapid initiation of control measures (which included training of healthcare workers, contact tracing, household visits, effective isolation of infectious patients, airport screening, and the creation of an Emergency Treatment Unit in two weeks) was critical to halt Ebola virus transmission, and probably prevent thousands of additional Ebola cases [15]. Our model (Additional file 2: Appendix S2, Table S3) suggests that we would have expected 367 cases of Ebola, if only 10 cases of Ebola had occurred in Nigeria before detection and initiation of an effective response, based on a \u201cLiberia-like\u201d Ebola transmission and response. However, partly due to the enhanced response capabilities from the Nigerian Polio Eradication Program, only one Ebola case occurred before detection and effective response, and Nigeria had a fast response due to availability of resources and trained health workforce. Using these values, to describe a unique scenario, our model predicted 14 Ebola cases (36 using population weights), which is close with what occurred in Nigeria (19 cases of Ebola after a quick and effective response). Our estimates are also comparable to the results from a model based on the days before the intervention, assuming 12 exposed individuals from an index case [15].",

Our illustrative estimates are subject to at least three limitations. First, extrapolating disease transmission in Liberia to other countries with very different public health systems may not be appropriate, as other factors such as public awareness and attitudes, or spontaneous behavioral changes could alter epidemic growth patterns. Second, we relied on constant epidemiological parameters (e.g., incubation period) for the Ebola outbreak across cities and countries. Third, we used three epidemic growth scenarios and assumed they depended on a country\u2019s GNI, based on an association between GNI per capita and health expenditures [42\u201344], which may not be reflective of the outbreak detection and response capabilities of some countries. There is substantial uncertainty in our estimates; we have no data to accurately predict the capacity of countries that were at high risk of Ebola transmission, as determined by air travel volume, of detecting and initiating an effective response to prevent or slow down an Ebola outbreak, and there is no counterfactual to contrast our results. However, even though we cannot know whether the estimated cases of Ebola that might have occurred had Ebola spread beyond Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia are accurate estimates, the results underscore the global risk posed by the Ebola crisis and potentially by other infectious disease threats [15, 19, 21\u201328, 55\u201359].",

The great paradox is that while the world may now be better prepared than ever in history to respond to emerging threats, we are at a higher risk of pandemics from increasing interconnectivity [3]. Health security has to be founded on robust local health systems that can rapidly detect and effectively respond to an infectious disease outbreak. When local capacity is insufficient, an effective global health response has to be quick and decisive, with all parties working cooperatively and in a coordinate fashion [64]. While the Ebola epidemic was unprecedented in many ways, the lack of a coherent, organized, and timely response, highlighted critical questions that need an urgent response.",
