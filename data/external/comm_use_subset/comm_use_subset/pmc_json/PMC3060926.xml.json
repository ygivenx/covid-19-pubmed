Current treatment strategies for influenza-A viruses, such as vaccines and drugs, have not provided broad and lasting protection, partly due to the constantly evolving nature of the viral surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA) that allows it to avoid host immune attack.",

These methods provide much more information on viral epitopes, although they are often laborious. The major alternative approaches for epitope mapping are derived from scanning with antigenic peptides displayed on the surface of bacteriophage, bacteria and yeast [14]\u2013[21], which in recent years have increasingly incorporated fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

The peptide library is generated by random digestion of the gene encoding the target viral protein, followed by a PCR-based reassembly step that results in fragments with controllable lengths (normally in the range of 100\u2013500 bp) [24]. These peptides are then expressed on the yeast cell surface by fusion to the yeast adhesion receptor AGA 2 protein, which has previously been used to display defined short antigen fragments of various viral and non-viral proteins [19]\u2013[21]. From the sequences of the antigenic peptides after screening, it is possible to determine the relative frequency of each amino acid residue involved in recognition by antisera, and how these residues are distributed in the three-dimensional structure of HA. Using this approach, we analyzed the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus HA protein using mouse, goat and human antisera. Unexpectedly, different antigenic profiles were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, four of which are located in the conserved HA stem region responsible for membrane fusion. ELISA binding assays and absorption experiments using peptides that encompass these regions have confirmed their antigenic activities.",

In step 1, the full length HA gene of the pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus (including the core HA protein of 519 aa, the signal peptide of 16 aa, and the inter membrane domain of 36 aa) was digested and re-assembled by PCR to form a pool of fragments enriched in 100\u2013500 bp [24]. In step 2, the fragment library was ligated into the yeast display vector pCTCON-T (derived from the yeast surface display vector pCTCON-2 [23] shown in Fig. 1), transformed into yeast EBY100 cells and induced for expression, generating a typical library of 1\u00d7105\u2013106 clones to cover most of the possible fragments [25]. Because there are 3 stop codons on pCTCON-T downstream of the peptide inserts to terminate every ORF, the theoretical possibility for in-frame fusions is 1/3 for the N-terminal end of the peptide inserts. Thus, the theoretical yield for cells expressing in-frame peptides is 1/6 (the fragments can be inserted in forward and reverse directions).",

This reduced laborious plasmid extraction from individual yeast clones. Plasmids containing in-frame sequences were transformed back into yeast for individual flow cytometry (FCM) verification. Retransformation and FCM were also performed for plasmids containing out of frame sequences (false positive). Antigenic peptide sequences were aligned with the HA sequence in step 6 (see also Figs. 2 and 3).

Freshly induced library cells were incubated with mixed sera from immunized mice and subsequently labeled with fluorescent secondary antibodies. To avoid potential bias introduced by growth advantage of the yeast cells, only one round of sorting was performed. Plasmids isolated from positive yeast cells were transformed into E. coli cells and plated. Single clones (100) were picked randomly and sequenced, of which 82 (82%) were shown to contain in-frame inserts. These results indicate that the sorting process is able to distinguish in-frame sequences from the random library that contained only 1/6 (16.7%) in-frame inserts efficiently. After verification of individual peptides by FCM detection, the ratio of recombinant antigen expressed on the yeast surface (RAYS) was determined by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity of peptide expressing yeast cells by the mean fluorescent intensity of the non-expressing (pCTCON-2) yeast cells [26]. 56 positive clones with a RAYS ratio \u22652 were considered as antigenic and analyzed at both the sequence and structural level [26]. Alignment of positive peptides with the original HA sequence shows that 87% are in the HA2 region (95\u00b127 aa), with just 13% in the HA1 region (259\u00b126 aa) which cover nearly the entire HA1 protein (Fig. 2, panel A). The FCM histograms of several representative yeast clones are shown in Fig. 3, panel A.

We also modify the residue frequency map by taking into account the respective RAYS ratios of positive peptides, which however results in an overall rather similar frequency map (Fig. S3, panel B). Furthermore, even if we combine all the in-frame sequences from sorted yeast cells, a similar map (Fig. S3, panel C) is again obtained, implying that the noises from the in-frame but false positive peptides are minimal.

This structural frequency map reveals that the major peak (corresponding to residues 387\u2013480 within the FWHM) on the residue frequency map can be divided into two dominant antigenic regions since they have independent structural features. One corresponds to the central coiled-coil helix CD in the HA2 subunit responsible for membrane insertion, designated as R1 (residues 424\u2013480, indicated by red, see also Fig. 5), while the other contains helix A in the HA2 subunit that is important for conformational change upon low pH exposure, designated as R2 (residues 387\u2013423, indicated by faint red and white, see also Fig. 5) [28]. R1 is present in a relatively recessed surface area while R2 is located near the exterior surface area of the stem region.

Surprisingly, alignment of the positive antigenic peptides with the full HA protein shows a distribution strikingly different from the alignment obtained using the mouse antisera in several aspects. First, 78% of the antigenic peptides are located in the HA1 region and have shorter lengths (54\u00b132 aa), while only 9% are in the HA2 region (96\u00b119 aa). Second, 13% of the peptides are in the region across HA1 and HA2 (66\u00b131 aa) (Fig. 2, panel B). Representative antigenic clones were subjected to FCM. As shown in Fig. 3, panel B, clones G-15 (residues 38\u2013136 of HA) and G-29 (residues 70\u2013162) in the HA1 region, G-46 (residues 308\u2013339) near the HA1-HA2 cross region, and G-55 (residues 413\u2013479) in the HA2 region, all shorter than 100 aa, demonstrated strong antigenicity (RAYS ratio >5).

First, the antibody responses to the 2009 A(H1N1) viral protein HA appear to vary significantly depending on the species, with the goat response being strikingly different from those of mouse and human (Fig. 4). These results imply possibly different immune responses among animal species, and in the case of human, the specific immunization background may also play a role [13]. Moreover, the antigenic peptides obtained from the screening against the mouse or human antisera are predominantly located in the HA2 region, whereas those from the screening against the goat antisera are predominantly in the HA1 region. Second, five antigenically important regions, R1 to R5 in the order from most membrane proximal to distal (Fig. 5), are identified. Moreover, except for R5 which is located in the vestigial esterase domain of the HA globular head, all of the other regions are in the HA stem region. Among them, R1 and R2 come together to form a major peak with a FWHM range from residues 387 to 480 (Fig. 4, panels A and E). Although the peptide P2 corresponding to the R2 region showed no measurable affinity to either mouse or human antisera (Fig. 6), which suggests that this region might be more conformation-dependent than the rest four regions, it is assigned as a separate region for the following reasons: (1) structurally it is distinguishable from the R1 region (Fig. 5), and (2) several recent studies have reported the epitopes of monoclonal antibodies targeting H1 subtype HA proteins, which fall into the R2 region of this study [10], [31], [32] (see below).",

However, technically the monoclonal antibodies used in these previous studies were obtained from murine hybridoma cells by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. The nature of these assays favored the isolation of antibodies that bound predominantly to the globular head of the virus and inhibited binding of the virus to the host cells. In this current study, however, complex antisera were used, which should contain antibodies recognizing other regions of the HA protein. On the other hand, only one antigenic region (R5) is identified in the globular head in this study, possibly because the epitopes in this head region are more conformation-dependent and may require longer peptides or even a complete domain of HA1 to be displayed for full antigenicity (at least for the mouse serum and human plasma samples). It is then noteworthy that the head region, especially the area around the receptor binding site, contains mostly beta structures, which more likely require stabilization by long-range interactions than the helical structures in other regions of HA (Fig. 5). However, the peptide library constructed in this study was enriched at 100\u2013500 bp (or less than 170 aa), which was likely insufficient to map the conformational epitopes. Nonetheless, the current screening method is a valuable complementation to the more classical approaches that are biased toward full HA1 or HA2 domain.",

            "text": "Several recent studies support our findings regarding antigenic regions R1\u2013R4 in the stem region of HA. In efforts aimed at characterizing antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity for various influenza virus subtypes [10], [13], [31], it was found that most of these antibodies bind to the HA stem region and interfere with conformational changes of the protein critical for membrane fusion. For example, in the case of antibody CR6261 (binding to HA of the SC1919 virus, H1 type), two antigenic regions on HA stem were revealed: helix A in the HA2 region, and the adjacent HA1 region [32]. The critical sites in helix A (corresponding to residues 390\u2013391, 393\u2013395, 398, 401\u2013402, 405 in H1N1 HA) fall within the R2 region identified in this study, whereas the hydrophobic interaction sites in the adjacent HA1 region (corresponding to residues 38\u201342, 306\u2013307 in H1N1 HA) fall into regions R3 and R4 of this study, respectively. More recently, it was reported that for a different cross-neutralizing antibody that targets a broad range of H3 subtype virus strains, 12D1, the dominant contacts on the antigen (corresponding to residues 425\u2013455 in H1N1 HA) [37] correlate well with the R1 region found in this study. Furthermore, vaccination in mice using a HA2-based synthetic peptide mimicking the 12D1 epitope was shown to provide protection against influenza viruses of H3N2, H5N1, and H1N1 subtypes [38]. Taken together, our approach should be useful for dissecting antigenic regions on the HA stem, and providing clues for designing more potent peptide vaccines in inducing cross-neutralizing antibodies than the entire HA protein [32].",

Our approach likely contains an inherent bias for shorter peptides, but nonetheless complements the more classical approaches that favor longer antigenic peptides or full antigenic domains. The scanning of antigenic peptides based on phage, bacterial or yeast surface display methods has been increasingly used in recent years. Our approach presents two advantages. First, technically we adopt an easy-to-implement scheme for generating a controllable size of peptides and our screening typically involves only one round of FACS-based sorting, in contrast to multiple rounds of panning or sorting used in the literature [15], [16], [18]. Although the latter results in many repeat sequences, we argue that much information is lost in the enrichment process. Second and more importantly, since simple alignment of antigenic peptides with the corresponding viral protein yields only limited information [15], [17], [39], we employ a novel statistical means of summarizing the frequency for each residue appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level, which enables a direct mapping of the antigenic structure of a viral protein. Along this line, it is interesting to note that, using our statistical approach, we re-evaluate the highly repeated antigenic peptides identified for the H5N1 HA protein in a recent report [15]. Several major peaks are clearly revealed (Fig. S7), which should be useful for further characterization of the antigenic peptides for H5N1 HA.",

Binding activities of the peptides against the mouse (B), goat (C) and human (D) antisera before and after immunization were characterized by the method of ELISA, with the Trx protein as the negative control. The x-axis shows the dilution ratios of corresponding antiserum samples. The y-axis shows the absorbance at 450 nm after development with the substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB).",
