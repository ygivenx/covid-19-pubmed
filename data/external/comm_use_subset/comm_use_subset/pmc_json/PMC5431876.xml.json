The heterogeneity of macrophages has been discussed with regard to different responses to various microenvironmental stimuli. Macrophages are classified into two distinct subtypes: the classically activated (M1) macrophage stimulated by microbial products and interferon-\u03b3, and the alternatively activated (M2) macrophage stimulated by IL-4, IL-13, and IL-101\u20134. Several studies have shown that M2 macrophages infiltrating into the tumor microenvironment contribute to cancer progression and are associated with tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. This macrophage phenotype is referred to as the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)5\u20137.",

CD163 is a hemoglobin scavenger receptor exclusively expressed in the monocyte-macrophage system. Furthermore, recent data indicate that soluble CD163 may be a valuable diagnostic parameter for monitoring macrophage activation in inflammatory conditions12.",

The paraffin-embedded specimens were processed into 5 \u03bcm thick sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and examined by experienced oral pathologists to confirm the diagnosis and histologic grade. The tumor stage was classified according to the TNM classification of the International Union Against Cancer. Tumor histologic grade was defined according to the WHO classification. The mode of tumor invasion was determined from H&E stained specimens according to the Yamamoto-Kohama criteria as follows: grade 1 = well-defined borderline; grade 2 = cords, less-marked borderline; grade 3 = groups of cells, no distinct borderline; and grade 4 = diffuse invasion (4 C = cord-like type; 4D = widespread type).

Macrophages are classified into two major subsets: classically activated (M1) macrophages stimulated by Th1-type responses and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages stimulated by Th2-type responses6, 7. M1 macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and contribute to microbicidal and tumoricidal immunity, whereas M2 macrophages scavenge debris and contribute to angiogenesis, suppression of adaptive immunity, wound healing and fibrosis by producing IL-10 and CCL18. Pollard et al.18 reported that macrophages infiltrating cancer tissues polarized to the M2 phenotype and were involved in the development of the tumor microenvironment by inducing angiogenesis and immune suppression. Recent studies have referred to these M2-polarized macrophages as TAMs, which express specific markers such as CD163 and CD20419, 20.",

Several studies have shown that CD204 deficiency resulted in impaired protection against pathogen infection27, 28, which has been partially attributed to the increased susceptibility of CD204-deficient animals to the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines during endotoxic shock29. Emerging evidence also implicates CD204 as a suppressor in the inflammatory response30, 31. Furthermore, in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, CD204 was demonstrated as a better marker for the TAM populations associating with tumor progression compared with CD16332.

There were clear differences in the localization of CD163- and CD204-positive cells in OSCC sections. Interestingly, the double immunofluorescent staining data revealed that CD163+CD204+TAMs mainly infiltrated around tumors and expressed higher levels of IL-10 and PD-L1 compared with other TAM subsets. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between number of IL-10 and PD-L1. IL-10 leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and then IL-10/STAT3 signaling induces PD-L1 overexpression33. We previously reported that phosphorylated-STAT3 expression was localized in the nucleus of the cancer cells and scattered widely in the cancer nests from patients with OSCC at advanced clinical stage34. In addition, CD163+CD204+ TAMs were also found to activate the function of T cell regulation and apoptosis. These findings indicate that CD163+CD204+ TAMs might play an important role in immune suppression and tumor progression via IL-10-Stat3-PD-L1 signaling.",

Moreover, the numbers of CD163+CD204+ TAMs also significantly associated with the progression-free survival curves. However, the association between the expression of TAM markers and clinical prognosis for cancer patients remains controversial. Hirayama et al.37 reported that a high number of CD204+ TAMs in lung SCCs was significantly correlated with advanced clinicopathological parameters and poor prognosis. Another study showed that there was no significant difference in clinicopathological factors and clinical prognosis between high and low expression groups of CD163+ TAMs in OSCC38. These results were consistent with our results in the present study. On the contrary, in gliomas, both CD204+ and CD163+ TAMs were positively correlated with the histological malignancy39. This contradictory conclusion may be due to different tumor types or methodologies.",
