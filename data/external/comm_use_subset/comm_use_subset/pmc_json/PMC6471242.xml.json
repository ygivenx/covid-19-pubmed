            "text": "Influenza, similar to coronaviruses, is also a contagious viral infection that causes acute respiratory illnesses and rapidly spreads through outbreaks [10,11]. The influenza virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, and there are three different types: A, B, and C. Among them, types A and B are of great concern as human pathogens and result in seasonal or interpandemic epidemics as well as global pandemics, such as those that are caused by influenza A viruses [12,13]. Over the past 100 years, four pandemics have been reported: H1N1 Spanish influenza (1918), H2N2 Asian influenza (1957), H3N2 Hong Kong influenza (1968), and recently, 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm09), which are all caused by influenza A viruses [12,14]. In each pandemic, the number of novel virus strains arose and spread through human communities, leading to the substantial morbidity and mortality related to bacterial pneumonia [11,15]. The influenza A viruses are single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses that are subtyped on the basis of the composition of their two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [16]. The genome of influenza A viruses comprises 8 separated gene segments encoding 16 proteins and is surrounded by a liquid envelope [17,18]. Two glycoproteins, HA and NA, are found in the viral envelopes, and these are considered to be the basis of antigenicity. HA initiates the infection of influenza virus by binding to the \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid and/or \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acid receptors on the surface of the host cell, followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion into the cell [17,19]. The NA protein serves as a sialidase, and it cleaves the link between the sialic acid and the HA protein to release the virus particles [11,19]. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [20] have approved only three drugs: Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate), Relenza (zanamivir), and Rapivab (peramivir).",

            "text": "Dereplication is the term that is used to discover new natural materials through the rapid identification of compounds that are based on new analytical tools, such as MS and NMR spectroscopy, to avoid the re-isolation of known components. In particular, the rapid development of modern MS techniques has accelerated dereplication strategies using high-performance liquid chromatography\u2014quadrupole time-of-flight mass (HPLC-qTOFMS) spectra with tandem database searching to identify the known compounds in the extract [21]. By increasing the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for measuring exact masses, the concept of \u201cmass defect\u201d is also increasingly being used in natural products research [22]. The mass defect is calculated as the deviation between the exact mass and the nominal mass (integer-rounded mass) of a compound [22,23]. Several methods have been developed to simplify the use of mass defects, including Kendrick mass defects, mass defect filtering, and fractional mass, which have played an important role in identifying many previously unknown compounds. In addition, a relative mass defect (RMD), calculated as (mass defect/measured monoisotopic mass) \u00d7 106 in ppm, was recently introduced [23,24]. The RMD remains constant for classes that share the same fractional hydrogen content, which is useful in classifying the compounds into groups with the same skeleton [23]. While fatty acids or hydrocarbons with high hydrogen contents show high RMDs (400 to 600 ppm), the values for polyphenolic metabolites are often less than 300 ppm due to their high oxygen contents [23]. In addition to modern techniques, such as HPLC-qTOFMS, classical bio-guided isolation has played an important role in the primary bioactive screening and identification of potential natural products. Pre-fractionation has recently been applied in bioactivity-guided isolations as an important step in obtaining bioactive materials. This is because the activities of minor components can be masked or decreased by more abundant inactive compounds in the total extract [25]. The combination of bio-guided isolation and dereplication enables the rapid and effective identification of the potential bioactive compounds [26].",

The RMD values of the detected phlorotannins were smaller than those of the other compounds, which are only approximately 10 to 200 ppm due to the nature of the structure of phlorotannins (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Positive absolute mass defects are usually observed in compounds that contain a large number of hydrogen atoms (mass defect +7.83 mDa), whereas the lower values are observed in compounds with large numbers of oxygen (mass defect \u22125.09 mDa) and nitrogen atoms (mass defect +3.07 mDa) [23]. Fatty acids contain many hydrogens and they have large RMD values (as suggested by compounds 21, 22, 24, and 26\u201329, Table 1 and Figure 2), but oxygen is a major elementary building block of phlorotannins, which reduces the RMD values of this group, particularly in this study, to less than 200 ppm (as demonstrated by compounds 6\u201318, Table 1). These features are very helpful for further studying the genus Ecklonia, which contains phlorotannins as major components. As the first step of screening by HPLC-qTOFMS, the calculation of RMD values for all detected peaks facilitates the identification of phlorotannins and allows researchers to dereplicate the reported compounds, especially in this genus. The RMD values in the list of unidentified peaks in Table 1 are also useful for estimating the types of structures that are associated with detected peaks.",

Overall, phlorotannins are divided into four classes that are based on the type of linkage that connects the phloroglucinol units, including ether-bound phlorotannins (fuhalols and phlorethols), phenyl-bound phlorotannins (fucols), ether and phenyl-bound phlorotannins (fucophlorethols), and dibenzo-dioxin-bound fucophlorethols (eckols and carmalols) [27,28]. Monomers in each class can be linked at various positions; thus, it is possible to have many structural isomers with the same molecular weight [27,28]. The fragmentation patterns that were observed for these peaks are therefore key to structural identification, as they indicate different losses of phloroglucinol monomers and hydroxyl groups [27]. In most previous studies, it has been necessary to isolate the compounds and use a combination of MS and NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the exact structures of phlorotannins [27]. Recently, an attempt was made to classify the types of phlorotannins in Sargassum fursiforme without isolation using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS) for the first time. In this study, we proposed an efficient method to dereplicate the various phlorotannins derivatives, which are major constituents in seaweeds, based on preliminary HPLC-qTOFMS accompanied by RMD analysis. Moreover, the hypothesis of dereplication was further validated by the isolation and structural elucidation of phlorotannins using NMR and HPLC-qTOFMS. The MS/MS data of the peaks that were detected in the EC70 fraction and the anticipated components are listed in Table 1. As shown in Figure 4C and Table 1, forty-one peaks were observed in the HPLC-qTOFMS spectroscopic data of the active fraction, and compounds 6\u201318 (Table 1) were identified as phlorotannins based on a comparison of their RMD values, molecular weights, and MS/MS fragments to the literature data. According to their MS/MS data, thirteen compounds were identified as eckol-type phlorotannins, which contain at least one 1,4-dibenzodioxin fragment in their structures and have been mostly found in Ecklonia and some other genus of seaweeds [27,28]. The fragment peaks that were observed in the MS/MS patterns of these compounds revealed the losses of phloroglucinol (126 amu), pentahydroxyl dibenzodioxin (263 amu) and eckol (371 amu) based on the dominant product ions at m/z 229 amu [371 (eckol) \u2212126 (phloroglucinol) \u221216 (oxygen atom) amu] and 261 amu [263 (pentahydroxyl dibenzodioxin) \u22122H]. For example, bieckol (compound 15, m/z 741.0737, Table 1) showed product ions at m/z 615, 479, 371, and 260 from losses of one phloroglucinol (\u2212126 amu), two phloroglucinols and a water (\u2212249 \u221218 amu), eckol (\u2212371 amu), and eckol with a phloroglucinol being followed by the attachment of an oxygen atom (\u2212371 \u2013126 +16 amu).",

The fragmentation patterns of the isolated phlorotannins are presented in Figure S17 (Supporting Information). The results revealed that HPLC-qTOFMS was a powerful tool for identifying the structure of phlorotannins, especially in the cases of isomers, as it can provide sufficient data for the elucidation of the chemical structures. As an example, the MS/MS fragmentation pattern of compound 18 (m/z 974.1038) is presented in detail. As identified in Table 1, compound 18 was established as compound 974-A due to its low RMD value (107 ppm) and the characteristic fragments that were observed at m/z 973, 707, 353, and 229 [29]. After isolation, the exact structure of 18 was further confirmed by NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with MS/MS fragmentation (Figure S17, Supporting Information). The product ions of 18 are shown in Figure S17 (Supporting Information) and they are due to the losses of bifuhalol (\u2013266 amu), three phlorotannins and one water (\u2212375 \u221218 amu), and four phlorotannin units and one water (\u2212448 \u221218 amu). Similarly, although compounds 10, 11, and 15 showed the same molecular ions ([M \u2212 H]\u2212 of 741.0647, 741.0723, and 741.0737, respectively) (Table 1), they could be distinguished by their NMR data and different fragment ions in their MS/MS patterns (Figure S17, Supporting Information). In particular, compound 10 showed fragments at m/z 619.0680, 495.0568, and 250.0477 from the losses of phloroglucinol (126 amu) and two equivalents of phloroglucinol (250 amu). Compound 11 generated product ion peaks at m/z 565.3355, 437.0064, 369.0253, and 230.9843 from the losses of phloroglucinol and three waters (176 amu) and a dioxinodehydroeckol (369 amu). 15 showed product ions at m/z 477.0398, 369.0198, 351.0087, and 125.0224, due to the losses of two molecules of phloroglucinol and water (264 amu) and three phloroglucinol units (372 amu).

The results indicated that six compounds (6 and 10\u201314) had moderate to strong antiviral activities against both viral strains at a concentration of 20 \u00b5M. Compounds 11\u201314, which displayed potent antiviral effects, were further tested against viral protein synthesis of the H1N1 A/PR/8/34 virus and compared to ribavirin as a positive control. The results, as shown in Figure 3A and Table S2 (Supporting Information), suggested that compound 12 was the most active compound with an EC50 of 13.48 \u00b1 1.93 \u03bcM. Thus, the dose-dependent inhibitory effects of compound 12 on viral protein synthesis were evaluated at four different concentrations 5, 10, 20, and 40 \u03bcM in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. As shown in Figure 3B, it is clear that, at higher concentrations, 12 more effectively inhibited protein expression in viral-infected cells. Compound 12 decreased the expression of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin at 10 \u03bcM, and the strongest inhibition capacity was observed at 40 \u00b5M. The fluorescence images that are shown in Figure 3C also explain the inhibitory effect of compound 12 on neuraminidase protein expression in H1N1 infected MDCK cells. The results suggested that compound 12 showed strong antiviral activity through inhibiting the expression of surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin, and neuraminidase.",

            "text": "Compound 1 was obtained as a brown powder and its molecular formula was determined to be C36H24O18 from its deprotonated ion peak at m/z 743.0895 (calcd. for [M \u2212 H]\u2212, 743.0890, Figure S1, Supporting Information). The chemical shifts observed in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Figures S3, and 4, Supporting Information), proton resonances in the downfield region of the aromatic chemical shift range, suggested a polyphenolic structure. In the 1H NMR spectrum, eleven aromatic protons were observed, including one proton singlet at \u03b4H 6.12 (H-3), one 2H overlapped singlet at \u03b4H 5.86 (H-3\u2033\u2033, 5\u2033\u2033), and four sets of meta-coupled doublets [\u03b4H 6.12 (overlap, H-5\u2033)/5.70 (d, 1.5, H-3\u2033), 6.09 (br s, H-6\u2032)/5.99 (d, 1.5, H-2\u2032), 5.97 (d, 2.7, H-8)/5.81 (d, 2.7, H-6), and 589 (d, 2.7, H-5\u2034)/5.54 (d, 2.7, H-3\u2034)]. The 13C NMR signals corresponded to thirteen unsubstituted (\u03b4C 92.7\u2013100.7 ppm) and twenty-three oxygenated aromatic carbons (\u03b4C 122.1\u2013158.1 ppm), which were assigned based on their HSQC and HMBC correlations (Figures S5 and S6, respectively, Supporting Information). These data suggested that the compound contained six phloroglucinol units. The coupling constants of the proton signals and HMBC data further confirmed the pattern of the substituents on 1 (Figure S20A, Supporting Information). The signal at \u03b4H 6.12 (1H, s) and the meta-coupled doublets at \u03b4H 5.89 (d, 2.7) and 5.81 (d, 2.7) were similar to those of eckol [30], and they were thus assigned to H-3 and H-8/H-6 of rings A and B, respectively. Similarly, the structure of 1 was presumed to include the C, D, E, and F rings of fucodiphloroethol G by comparison with the reported NMR data [31]. The two carbon signals at \u03b4C 100.7 and 101.4 ppm also indicated that the structure of 1 contained one C\u2212C bond similar to that of fucodiphloroethol G [31]. However, the asymmetric structure of the C ring revealed that fucodiphloroethol and eckol moieties of 1 were linked through the C ring. The ROESY correlation of H-3 (A ring) with 5\u2032-hydroxyl (C ring) (Figure S7, Supporting Information) suggested a phenyl linkage connecting the C and A rings. The long-range couplings between the proton of rings A and C, as well as rings B and E, were explained by their positions derived from three-dimensional structure optimization using molecular modelling (Figure S20B, Supporting Information). A comprehensive explanation of the structure was obtained from the MS/MS data. As shown in Figure S17 (Supporting Information), the fragment ion corresponding to C24H15O11 (m/z 479.0608, calcd 479.0614, \u0394 \u22120.6 mmu) was the main fragment of 1, and the other detected fragments were explained by the losses of phloroglucinol units (\u2212126 amu) or pentahydroxyl dibenzodioxin (263 amu). In particular, the fragments of 1 at m/z 583.0716, 479.0608, 353.0284, and 265.0342 amu were from the losses of one phloroglucinol and two water molecules (\u2212126 \u221234 amu), two phloroglucinol units and one oxygen atom (\u2212248 \u221216 amu), three phloroglucinol and one water (\u2212372 \u201318 amu), and pentahydroxyl dibenzodioxin and two protons (\u2212263 \u22122 amu). Therefore, the chemical structure of 1 was determined to be dibenzodioxin-fucodiphloroethol (DFD).",

The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 (Figure S10, Supporting Information) showed a total of sixteen proton signals, including three proton singlets at \u03b4H 6.21 (1H, s, H-5\u2033\u2033\u2033), 6.14 (1H, s, H-4\u2033\u2033\u2034), and 5.92 (1H, s, H-3); two sets of meta-coupled doublets at \u03b4H 6.01 (1H, d, 2.2 Hz, H-6), 5.88 (1H, d, 2.2 Hz, H-8), 5.89 (1H, d, 2.4 Hz, H-5\u2034), and 5.55 (1H, d, 2.4 Hz, H-3\u2034); two sets of meta-coupled 2H signals at \u03b4H 5.87 (2H, s, H-3\u2033, 5\u2033), 5.74 (2H, d, 1.8 Hz, H-2\u2032, 6\u2032), and 5.81 (1H, br t, H-4\u2032); and, two sets of meta-coupled singlets at \u03b4H 6.14 (1H, br s, H-5\u2033\u2033), 5.71 (1H, br s, H-3\u2033\u2033), 6.11 (1H, br s, H-5\u2033\u2034), and 6.00 (1H, br s, H-3\u2033\u2034). The 13C NMR spectrum of 2 (Figure S11, Supporting Information) showed 54 signals in the chemical shift range of aromatic carbons. The thirteen protonated carbon signals from \u03b4C 92.7 to 98.7 ppm, along with thirty-six oxygenated aromatic carbon signals that were located in the range of 121.4\u2013163.5 ppm, suggested the presence of nine aromatic rings in the structure of 2. All of the carbon signals in 13C NMR spectrum of 2 were assigned based on their HSQC and HMBC correlations (Table S3 and Figures S12 and S13, Supporting Information). When compared with the reported phlorotannins, the chemical shifts of the atoms in rings A, B, C, and D of 2 were similar to those belonging to 7-phloroeckol [32]. Similarly, the chemical shifts of the atoms in rings D, E, F, and G were assigned based on the structure of fucodiphloroethol G [31]. The C\u2212C bond between rings F and G of 2 was confirmed from the chemical shifts at \u03b4C 100.7 and 101.5 ppm. In addition, the remaining two aromatic rings of 2 were suggested to be rings H and I based on the MS/MS fragmentation analysis of 2. The fragment at 265 amu was suggested by the vicinal trihydroxylated structure of compound 2 (Figure S17, Supporting Information), which was characteristic of a bifuhalol unit that contained an extra hydroxyl group on the terminal phlorotannin unit [27]. The connectivity between all of the fragments was further determined by the ROESY spectrum (Figure S14, Supporting Information). The correlations of the signals corresponding to H-2\u2032/6\u2032 in ring A with H-3 (B ring) and H-6 (C ring) and between H-6 (C ring) with H-3 (D ring) confirmed the connectivity of these rings, as shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information). The 7-phloroeckol moiety was connected to the 1\u2034 position of the ring E based on the ROESY correlation between the H-3\u2033 (D ring) and H-6\u2034 (E ring). Similar to compound 1, the long-range correlations of the protons on rings A and D, as well as on rings B and G of 2, were further supported by the optimized three-dimensional structure obtained using molecular modelling (Figure S20B, Supporting Information). The fragment information from HRMS/MS data of 2, as described in Figure S17 (Supporting Information), also supported the chemical structure of compound 2. The fragments that were observed in Figure S17 (Supporting Information) at m/z 989.0983, 879.0299, 556.0534, and 265.0334 amu were explained by the losses of one phloroglucinol unit (\u2212126 amu); two phloroglucinol units and the addition of one water (\u2212252 and +18 amu); one eckol, one bifuhalol, the addition of one acetic acid, and one water (\u2212372 \u2212263 +60 +18 amu); and, a bifuhalol fragment at 265.0334 amu. Finally, the exact structure of 2 was elucidated as dibenzodioxin-fucodiphloroeckol (DFE).",

The extracts of E. cava or phlorotannins (dieckol, phloroglucinol, eckol, phlorofucofuroeckol, and 7-phloroeckol, etc.) have been reported to have antiviral activities, such as PEDV [9], viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) [33], human papilloma virus (HPV) [34], and murine norovirus (MNV) [35]. However, in this study, a method of producing a bioactive fraction was developed, and this fraction could be used to obtain antiviral materials from a total extract. Additionally, seven lead compounds were identified and purified from the bioactive fraction. Therefore, the fraction of the E. cava extract and the isolated phlorotannins have been shown to be potentially industrially applicable in the prevention or treatment of influenza A viruses.",

            "text": "The present study discussed using MS/MS fragmentation analysis coupled with RMD filtering as a dereplication method to identify phlorotannins, which are bioactive substances in the Ecknolia genus, especially in Ecknolia cava. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply and post-evaluate the accuracy of the RMD values in conjunction with MS/MS analysis for the identification of phlorotannins. The results of the dereplication study provide a quick initial screening for the phlorotannin motif, as these compounds show RMD values of less than 200 ppm, typically with fragments from losses of phloroglucinol units. In addition, different ranges of RMD values suggest the presence of different types of structures that are present in the compound. MS/MS was not only useful for dereplication but it also provided strong evidence to confirm the structures of phlorotannins by their fragments. Based on this dereplication method, two new compounds were identified and further elucidated by spectroscopy. In addition, this study was conducted to identify the antiviral lead compounds from E. cava using bio-guided isolation. Our results suggested that phlorofucofuroeckol A (12) from E. cava plays a key role in the antiviral activities of this seaweed against H1N1 and H9N2 virus. The strong inhibitory effects of this compound against neuraminidase and hemagglutinin suggested that it could be a potential agent for the further development of antiviral drugs.",

The active fractions were analysed by TLC (thin-layer chromatography) on silica gel 60 F254 and RP-18 F254 plates from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Spraying with a vanillin reagent that contained 0.5 g of vanillin, 80 mL of sulfuric acid, and 20 mL of ethanol developed the plates, and the compounds on the TLC plates were detected at 254 and 365 nm. Column chromatography separations were carried out using various resins, including Diaion HP-20 (Mitsubishi Chemical Co. Tokyo, Japan), Sephadex LH-20 (Sigma-Aldrich Corp, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), silica gel (Merck, 40\u201363 \u00b5m particle size), and C18-RP silica gel (Merck, 40\u201363 \u03bcm particle size). Preparative HPLC separations were performed by using a Gilson system with an Optima Pak C18 column (10 mm \u00d7 250 mm, 10 \u00b5m in particle size, RS Tech, Seoul, Korea) and a UV detector at wavelengths of 205 and 254 nm. All of the solvents that were used for extraction and isolation were of analytical grade. The most stable configuration of compounds 1 and 2 (Figure S20, Supporting Information) were calculated by CONFLEX 8 (Conflex Corp., Tokyo, Japan) using molecular mechanics force-field (MMFF94s) calculations with a search limit of 1.0 kcal/mol.",
