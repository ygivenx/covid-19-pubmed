A CoV causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was identified in Southeast China in 2002 and rapidly spread worldwide to more than 30 countries within 6 months, infecting more than 8,000 people, with mortality in approximately 10% of the cases (2, 3). While SARS-CoV has not since reappeared in humans, other CoVs, including ones similar to SARS-CoV, are widely disseminated among bats circulating all over the world, making future outbreaks possible (4\u20136). In fact, a novel CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in September 2012 in two human patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia (7, 8); since then, the WHO has reported 2,144 laboratory-confirmed cases and at least 750 deaths (as of 29 March 2018) (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). These data indicate that emergence of other highly pathogenic CoVs is likely and thus that the study of the virus-host interaction is essential to develop antiviral therapies and safe vaccines.",

Viroporins promote several steps of the virus replication cycle, including entry, genome replication, morphogenesis, and release from the infected cell (17, 18). Several viroporins have important roles in viral pathogenesis, promoting ion imbalances within cells (13, 19\u201321) or disrupting cellular pathways through protein-protein interactions (22). Given their potential as antiviral targets, there is substantial interest in the study of these proteins (18, 23).",

The 3a protein is 274 amino acids (aa) in length with three transmembrane domains (TMDs). It is the largest SARS-CoV accessory protein and is likely involved in virus release (27) and pathogenesis (29). It causes membrane rearrangements in infected cells, leading to an increase in levels of intracellular vesicles that may facilitate nonlytic release of viral particles (30). Furthermore, it colocalizes with M protein, which, together with E protein, is essential for virus assembly, supporting the notion that the 3a protein is important for SARS-CoV assembly or budding (31, 32). However, most studies have been based on 3a overexpression and little is known about the relevance of this protein in the context of natural infection.",

These interactions are mediated between PDZ domains and PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs), peptide sequences that are most frequently located at the C terminus of the IC proteins (40, 41). PDZ domains are protein recognition sequences, 80 to 90 aa in length, and constitute a large family of globular domains found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are more than 400 cellular protein isoforms containing a PDZ domain in the human proteome (42). The PBM core sequence includes 4-aa residues, numbered from the C terminus (p0), which is always hydrophobic, to the N terminus (p-1, p-2, and p-3). There are three classes of PBMs, depending on the identity of residue p-2: class I for Thr/Ser, class II for any hydrophobic residue, and class III for Glu/Asp. Protein-protein interactions involving PDZ domains modulate cellular pathways important for viral replication, dissemination in the host, and pathogenesis (43). Furthermore, some PDZs also bind PBMs located in the internal region of proteins or lipids (44, 45). Of the three SARS-CoV viroporins, both proteins 3a and E have a class II PBM at their C terminus; while the PBM of E protein is involved in pathogenesis (46, 47), the role of the PBM of protein 3a, and of similar motifs present in other CoV proteins such as MERS-CoV proteins E and 5, remains unknown.",

Neither single deletion of the IC activity or of PBM from protein 3a diminished SARS-CoV replication and virulence, in contrast with E protein, which required both for virulence (34, 46). Protein 3a IC activity was characterized in planar lipid bilayers, showing that it forms non-voltage-gated ion channels. Furthermore, we identified residues located in TMD2 and TMD3 of the 3a protein that were involved in its IC activity. The potential interdependence of the three viroporins described in SARS-CoV was studied by deletion of single viroporins or of different combinations of two viroporins. The variant missing both the 3a and E proteins was not viable, indicating that the presence of at least one of the proteins is essential for virus viability. Furthermore, it was shown that either protein should maintain its PBM to compensate for the absence of the other full-length protein. These results suggest that PBMs interact with cellular proteins with PDZ domains to change cell metabolism, enhancing virus replication or pathogenicity. Identification and inhibition of specific cellular pathways affected by these interactions may be crucial for the identification of new antiviral strategies.",

Analysis of the growth kinetics of each mutant in Vero E6 cell supernatants (Fig. 1A) was used to determine their requirement for replication. Cell-associated virus was also analyzed at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi), showing results similar to those observed for the released virus (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).

However, while the \u0394E mutant showed 100-fold-lower titers (around 8 \u00d7 105 PFU/ml), \u03943a titers decreased slightly (3-fold) (3 \u00d7 107 PFU/ml).

However, as the relevance of the IC activity of the 3a protein was not known, we studied 3a protein in planar lipid bilayers and identified the amino acids involved in ion conductance. This system was used because its high sensitivity allows the detection of electric currents of a single ion channel (50). To this end, a baculovirus was engineered to express the parental 3a protein in Sf-9 cells. Conductance of purified protein 3a was evaluated in the presence of KCl in planar lipid bilayers with a biologically relevant mix of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) with ratios of 3:1:1 (wt/wt), which is a composition similar to that of intracellular organelle membranes, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Single-channel conductance was estimated from a statistical analysis of the current jump amplitudes. This procedure allows a reliable estimate of the most probable value of current change every time a new channel is inserted or disappears. Although several channels were being inserted, the magnitude of the current through a single channel could be discriminated. Current jumps corresponding to 201 independent events were measured under conditions of an applied voltage of +100 mV. Histograms of the current jump amplitudes of the recorded traces showed that the most frequent events corresponded to single-channel conductance of 16 pA (Fig. 3A and B). Simultaneous bursts of two or three 3a ion channels were also observed, although with much lower frequency (Fig. 3B).",

Determination of the sign of the Erev provides a quick estimation of the channel selectivity, that is, of its preference for cations or anions (51, 52). By comparing the measured Erev to the theoretical Erev that would be obtained in the case of a neutral pore (i.e., representing only the difference between cation and anion intrinsic mobilities), the selectivity of the ion channel can be inferred. The theoretical Erev is calculated using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, replacing the permeability ratio P+/P\u2212 by the solution diffusion coefficient ratio D+/D\u2212 (53). Higher, lower, or similar measured Erev values indicate anion selectivity, cation selectivity, or no selectivity, respectively. Interestingly, in the presence of monovalent ions (Na+ and K+), the protein 3a IC showed weak cation selectivity. However, in the presence of Ca++, the channel behaved as a neutral channel with no preference for anions or cations (Table 1). Taken together, these results indicated that at least Na+, K+, and Ca++ were conducted through the 3a protein IC.",

The SARS-CoV E protein localizes to the ERGIC (56), but less is known about protein 3a localization (27). The potential colocalization of the 3a and E proteins was first studied by infecting Vero E6 cells with wt rSARS-CoV. Confocal microscopy analysis of rSARS-CoV-MA15 at 24 hpi showed that the proteins were located in different cell subcompartments during infection, as the Pearson\u2019s coefficient value was below 0.6 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (57); protein 3a mainly accumulated at an unidentified perinuclear compartment different from the ERGIC (Fig. 8A). E protein IC activity promotes virulence by releasing calcium from the ERGIC, leading to inflammasome activation (34, 58). We showed that protein 3a IC activity is not involved in virus virulence. To extend these results, we next determined whether 3a was localized to any of the known cellular calcium reservoirs, i.e., the ER, the Golgi apparatus, and the mitochondria (59), using specific markers, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (ER marker), 58 K (Golgi marker), and aconitase 2 (mitochondrion marker) (Fig. 8B). Also, other subcellular compartments were analyzed for colocalization with the 3a protein by the use of antibodies (Abs) against Na+/K+ ATPase (plasma membrane marker), Rab5 (early endosome marker), Rab7 (late endosome marker), and LAMP-1 (lysosome marker) (Fig. 9). Pearson\u2019s coefficient was below 0.6 in all cases (Table S1). Overall, 3a protein did not localize at any of the main intracellular calcium storage locations, suggesting that it is not located at a site that facilitates increased cytosolic calcium levels. Collectively, these results suggest that the IC activity of proteins 3a and E, while shared by the two proteins, is not the function responsible for the replacement for the full-length E and 3a proteins.",

The viability of each mutant was determined after rescue from infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. For each mutant, two independently generated BACs were analyzed (Fig. 10A). Mutations within the N-terminal domain or TMD of protein E did not affect virus viability, indicating that neither harbored the motif responsible for viroporin replacement. However, when the protein E PBM was disrupted by amino acid substitutions [(\u03943a,E-PBM\u2212)], infectious virus was not rescued. Consistent with this, when the original PBM was substituted for an alternative one [(\u03943a,E-PBM*)], viable virus was recovered. Furthermore, the truncated mutant [(\u03943a,E-\u0394PBM)] rapidly reverted in the first passage, losing the engineered stop codon during passage in cell culture and regaining the PBM [\u03943a,E-\u0394PBM(rev)]. Collectively, these data strongly support the idea of the requirement of the PBM for viability of SARS-CoV (Fig. 10A) and indicate that it was the E protein with a functional PBM that compensated for the loss of the full-length 3a protein. An additional mutant was generated in which the protein 3a PBM was mutated in the context of full-length E protein deletion [(3a-PBM\u2212,\u0394E)], but the rescue of this virus was not possible (Fig. 10B), again showing the necessity of at least one of the two proteins with a functional PBM for virus viability in the context of complete deletion of either the E gene or the 3a gene.",

In addition, \u03943a viruses with small deletions throughout the C terminus of E protein were not viable, possibly due to the requirement of the 3a protein native structure or of a length essential for PBM availability for binding to other viral or cellular proteins (Fig. 10A). To analyze the relevance of protein shortening or folding, an additional mutant was constructed in the \u03943a background by filling in the E\u03944 deletion with an alanine-rich sequence in order to restore the original length or folding of the E protein [(\u03943a,E\u03944*)] (Fig. S2).

All three PBM mutants were viable, showing that the consequences of the presence of E and 3a protein PBMs when these proteins have been completely deleted are different from those seen when only their PBM is missing. However, virus titers decreased 10-fold when both viral PBMs were missing in comparison to the levels seen with the parental virus or mutants lacking only one PBM (Fig. 11A). Remarkably, when PBM was present in E protein, the virus was highly virulent independently of whether the 3a protein included a PBM (Fig. 11B). In contrast, mortality significantly decreased when E protein lacked a PBM, regardless of the presence or absence of a PBM within protein 3a. These results indicated that the impact of the presence or absence of the E protein PBM on virulence is definitive, as it determines whether a virus is pathogenic or nonpathogenic, respectively. In contrast, the presence or absence of 3a protein with or without its PBM had little impact on virus virulence, illustrating the much greater relevance of the E protein PBM than of the 3a PBM with respect to virus pathogenicity.",

The roles of these viroporins in replication and virulence had been studied in detail only for SARS-CoV E protein (34, 46, 58, 60), though roles in replication have also been established for HCoV-OC43 ns12.9 (25), HCoV-229E 4a (24), and PEDV 3 (26). MERS-CoV encodes two proteins, E and 5, homologues of the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins, respectively. While the IC activity of MERS-CoV E protein has been previously described (15), the potential IC activity of protein 5 is yet to be studied in detail. However, due to its similarity to SARS-CoV 3a, HCoV-229E 4a, and PEDV 3, IC conductance by this protein is expected. Furthermore, both the MERS-CoV E and 5 proteins have a putative PBM at their carboxy terminus, similarly to the SARS-CoV E and 3a proteins.",

Here, we show that removal of the 3a protein slightly reduced virus titers in vitro compared to the results seen with the parental virus (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the titers of the \u03943a mutant were reduced 10-fold in vivo (Fig. 1B), indicating that the 3a protein was required for optimal SARS-CoV replication. This result is in agreement with previous studies showing a slight reduction of SARS-CoV-\u03943a titers in Vero E6 cells (62). Nevertheless, it has to be noted that the mice in the previous study were infected with a human SARS-CoV Urbani strain, which causes only a mild murine infection, in contrast to our mouse-adapted strain (61). The reduction of titers after infection with \u03943a mutant viruses may reflect the role of 3a in membrane rearrangement, increasing the levels of intracellular vesicles that can promote nonlytic release of viral particles (30). Alternatively, protein 3a may induce apoptosis (30, 63) and may enhance inflammation by activating nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) and RANTES (CCL5) (29). In fact, histopathological analysis of lungs from SARS-CoV-\u03943a-infected mice showed minimal damage or cellular infiltration at 2 and 4 dpi, whereas mice infected with the SARS-CoV parental virus revealed interstitial and peribronchial cell infiltration and edema in both alveolar and bronchiolar airways at 2 dpi and, mainly, at 4 dpi (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). This suggests that the attenuation of the \u03943a mutant may be due to its inability to activate an exacerbated proinflammatory response, resulting in survival of infected mice. In fact, similar results were obtained in the lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E, which also led to attenuation by downregulation of the host proinflammatory response (61, 64).",

            "text": "Residues involved in E protein IC activity have been previously identified (33), and this activity was essential for replication and virulence (34). We previously reported that the E ion channel activates the inflammasome through calcium release from intracellular stores (34, 58). IC activity of SARS-CoV E protein is exerted in the membrane of the ERGIC. This facilitates the release of Ca2+ from this intracellular compartment, which contributes to the activation of the inflammasome complex, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. The accumulation of these cytokines promotes an exacerbated proinflammatory response, which leads to death. Thus, E protein IC activity is a virulence factor similar to the IC activities of M2 from influenza virus (19) or rotavirus NSP4 (13, 66). As E protein IC activity promotes virulence via inflammasome activation (34, 58), we hypothesized that protein 3a IC activity could act in a similar way. However, as no correlation was found between protein 3a IC activity and SARS-CoV titer and pathogenicity, we conclude that, in our mouse model, the IC activity of 3a protein did not affect replication and virulence in the same way as that of E protein. However, SARS-CoV 3a protein TMD3\u2212 and TMD[2,3]\u2212 mutants displayed no IC activity and were attenuated. In principle, a possible explanation for this observation is that the TMD3\u2212 three-amino-acid mutations present in both mutant TMD3\u2212 and mutant TMD[2,3]\u2212 could have disrupted a function of the 3a protein other than its IC activity. Nevertheless, viruses that included the point mutations that disrupt IC activity (Y91A, H93A, and Y109A) and which are less likely to affect other functions of the 3a protein than the 3-amino-acid and 5-amino-acid mutations of TMD3\u2212 and TMD[2,3]\u2212, respectively, were completely virulent. The TMD3\u2212 mutant showed 10-fold-lower titers in the lungs of infected mice. The impact of these mutants on virus replication and virulence may in principle be due to an exclusive effect on 3a protein functions different from its IC activity. The TMD[2,3]\u2212 mutant maintained the same titers as the native virus, which could be explained if the mutations in TMD2 were structurally compensated for the ones in TMD3 when the two were simultaneously present in protein 3a. Overall, these results indicate that protein 3a IC activity is not involved in virus virulence.",

There are 266 motifs present in more than 400 cellular protein isoforms, each containing between 1 and 13 PDZ domains (42). As SARS-CoV E and 3a protein PBM sequences are different (DLLV and SVPL, respectively), they are likely to interact with different networks of PDZ-containing cellular proteins. The protein 3a PBM interaction with cellular PDZ proteins most likely induces a signaling pathway that either is not pathogenic for the host or is activated at a lower intensity due to a reduced affinity of the viral PBM for the cellular PDZ domain, explaining why viruses with or without the PBM of 3a showed no significant differences in pathogenicity.

The 8a protein was included to determine its potential relevance in the absence of the other viroporins, showing a significant impact on viral growth under conditions in which 3a protein or E protein was absent. In contrast, we observed that SARS-CoV was not viable when both the 3a and E proteins were absent but that its viability was rescued by the presence of either 3a or E. We showed that the E protein could compensate for the loss of the other viroporin providing that it carried a functional PBM (Fig. 10A), a conclusion reinforced by the results obtained with five different recombinant viruses. Even more biologically relevant was the rapid reversion of a stop codon introduced 9 aa upstream of the carboxy terminus of the E protein in mutant \u0394PBM. Reversion was identified only in this mutant, presumably because reversion of a single altered codon occurs more easily than the 4-aa changes in E-PBM\u2212 or the deletions performed (Fig. 10A). Our results also showed that a 3a protein carrying a PBM could compensate for the loss of E protein and could restore virus replication but not virulence (Fig. 10B and 11).",

            "text": "The idea of the requirement of SARS-CoV PBMs for virus replication and virulence is also supported by our previous observations revealing that \u0394E mutants evolved to introduce a new transmembrane protein with a PBM to compensate for the loss of the whole E protein during passage either in cell culture or in vivo (68). In addition, when SARS-CoV-\u0394E was passaged in mice, it spontaneously gained an internal PBM in the 8a protein. PBMs are also phylogenetically conserved in proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV isolates from humans, civet cats, dromedary camels, and bats (Fig. S4), further reinforcing the idea of the relevance of PBMs for coronavirus viability. Viral PBM-cellular PDZ interactions have been previously described in several viruses. For instance, the PBM of E6 oncoprotein from human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) interacts with several cellular proteins containing PDZ motifs, leading to tumorigenesis and virus dissemination (69). On the other hand, different strains of rabies virus (RABV) include a variety of PBMs in the G protein that differentially contribute to viral virulence through activation of a variety of signaling pathways (70). In the case of influenza virus, NS1 protein has a PBM located at its carboxy terminus that is possibly involved in enhanced virulence (71). In addition, the vaccinia virus F11 protein has both a PDZ domain and a PBM, which influence viral spread (72).",

We showed a dominance of E protein PBM and IC activities over that of the 3a protein homologues. However, the protein 3a PBM became relevant for virus viability in the absence of full-length E protein. These results contribute to a better understanding of the role of CoV IC activities and PBMs, with impacts on the rational design of future vaccines and antivirals.",

Generation of the E deletion mutant was described previously (61). The 3a gene was deleted by overlap extension PCR using pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 and the primers shown in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Mutations included deletion of a region (nt 25270 to 25668) of the SARS-CoV genome, resulting in deletion of the 3a protein while retaining the 3b protein; a disruption of the ATG start codon of the 3a gene; and point mutations at nt 25673 and 25683 to introduce two stop codons and a point mutation at nt 26042 to disrupt a potential initiation codon. A PCR product was generated from nt 24937 to 26060 of the SARS-CoV genome, digested at flanking SwaI and BamHI sites, and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-SARS-CoV (which contains the nt-18404-to-26044 sequence of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone) to generate plasmid pBAC-SARS-PmeI-BamHI-\u03943a. Finally, that plasmid was digested with PmeI and BamHI and the fragment carrying the 3a deletion was reinserted into a similarly digested pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 plasmid to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-\u03943a.

The final PCR products were digested with XcmI and NheI and cloned into intermediate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV (which contains nt 26044 to 29782 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone [49]), thus obtaining pBAC-BamHI-RsrII-SARS-CoV-\u03948a.

(Right panel) Groups of six 16-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of the parental virus (WT, black columns) or of a SARS-CoV variant lacking the protein 3a PBM (3a-PBM\u2212, red columns). At 2 and 4 dpi, 3 mice from each group were sacrificed to determine virus titers. Data summarize two replicate experiments. Data represent means \u00b1 SD. (B) Groups of five 16-week-old BALB/c mice were subjected to mock infection (PBS, gray filled squares) or infected with 100,000 PFU of the parental (wild-type) virus (WT; black filled hexagons) or of genetically engineered mutants lacking the 3a protein (\u03943a, green filled circles) or lacking the protein 3a PBM (3a-PBM\u2212, red filled diamonds). Mean levels of weight loss (left graph) and survival (right graph) through 10 dpi are represented for each group. Data summarize two replicate experiments with equivalent results. Error bars represent the standard deviations of mouse weight data.",
