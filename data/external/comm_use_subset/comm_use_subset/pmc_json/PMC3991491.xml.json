Studies have shown that glycyrrhizin can regulate the secretion of various cytokines and the functioning of immunomodulatory effects in the central nervous system (6,7). Glycyrrhizin can also improve intracerebral ischemic injury (6,8,9). During 20 years of anti-inflammatory application for the treatment of liver diseases, glycyrrhizin has not generated any toxicity or side-effects (10\u201312). However, the effects of glycyrrhizin on functional recovery following peripheral nerve injury are not well understood.",

The sciatic nerve cords were completely interrupted at 0.5 cm below the ischial tuberosity and immediately underwent microsurgical anastomosis using 11-0 microsutures (Sharpoint\u2122 MicroSutures, Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Finally, the muscle and skin were sutured. Mice were randomized into four groups of 40 mice each and treated with different concentrations of glycyrrhizin for four different time periods. Glycyrrhizin was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl solution and administered intragastrically, daily for 14 continuous days. The final high-, mid- and low-doses were 20, 10 and 5 g/kg weight/day, respectively. An NaCl solution (0.9%) of an equivalent volume served as the control. Mice were sacrificed one, two, four and eight weeks after injury.",

Briefly, the sciatic nerves were exposed at 24\u00b0C, then pin electrodes were pierced into the musculi soleus for wave recording (M point) and grounding electrodes were placed on the tails. A single current stimulus (10 mA) was employed to stimulate proximal anastomotic ischial tuberosity (P point) and the distal sciatic nerve bifurcation point (D point), respectively, using a parallel stimulating electrode with a fixed space of 3.3 mm between two tips.

Levels of p75NTR protein in each group increased markedly between one and two weeks after injury, and then decreased markedly between two and eight weeks. At each time-point, each glycyrrhizin treatment group had significantly reduced p75NTR protein expression versus the control group (P<0.05 for each). Meanwhile, the high- and mid-dose groups at one and four weeks showed lower levels of p75NTR protein versus the low-dose groups (P<0.05 for each), and the high-dose group expressed significantly reduced levels versus the low-dose group at two weeks (P<0.05). The qPCR analysis of the results is shown in Fig. 2. Overall, the levels of p75NTR mRNA in each group increased following injury and then decreased. The levels of p75NTR mRNA in the low-dose and control groups increased between one and four weeks and then decreased between four and eight weeks. While a decrease in p75NTR mRNA expression in the high- and mid-dose groups occurred early between two and eight weeks, p75NTR mRNA expression in the high- and mid-dose groups was significantly lower versus the control (P<0.05) at each time-point. Application of glycyrrhizin, particularly using doses of 20 and 10 mg/kg/day, markedly inhibited the expression of p75NTR at the protein and mRNA levels.",

This was verified by measuring the potential amplitude and MNCV in mice. Dual staining of the affected spinal cord segments, L4\u2013L6, connected to injured sciatic nerves, was performed to examine the structural evidence that 10 and 20 mg/kg doses of glycyrrhizin can elevate the number and diameter of myelinated fibers, accelerating nerve regeneration. Subsequently, the GFAP- and NSE-marked fluorescence in astrocytes was employed to assess the nerve damage-associated molecules. Upregulation of GFAP in astrocytes partially marks the formation of glial scars, showing that astrocytes interact with fibrous tissues to reconstruct the glial layers around the central injury core (24,25). NSE, a homodimer, is a biomarker for mature neurons and neuroendocrine cells (26). High-dose glycyrrhizin results in increased NSE and reduced GFAP expression in astrocytes, indicating sciatic nerve repair.",

This downregulation of p75NTR synchronizes the functional recovery of the sciatic nerve, structural myelination and neuronal regeneration and the improvement of molecular markers. Considering p75NTR is an apoptosis-inducing receptor and is associated with the inflammatory response of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (13\u201318), the downregulation of p75NTR may likely result in the reduction of the local inflammatory response, lessening the glial scar and recovering nerve conduction function. Simultaneously, downregulation of p75NTR may attenuate the apoptosis-inducing receptor function of p75NTR, promoting neuronal regeneration and the expression of marker molecules. Therefore, sciatic nerve regeneration is associated with the downregulation of p75NTR.",
