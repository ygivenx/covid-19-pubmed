It is an acute febrile illness with the characteristic findings of high fever, rash and generalised symptoms such as myalgia and headache. The disease is common in Southeast Asia, Australia, Japan, China and South Korea during the autumn season.1\u20133 The main reservoir is rodents, and their mites act as both the reservoir and the vector. Human infection occurs when the larvae of the thrombiculid mite infected with O. tsutsugamushi bite people and suck human tissue fluid.4\u20136 The clinical prognosis of scrub typhus varies from mild-to-severe courses. Although most of the patients have a benign course, some suffer serious complications such as rickettsial infections causing disseminated multiorgan vasculitis. According to the organ involved, patients could present with pneumonitis, meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, acute pulmonary oedema, pericarditis, hepatitis and even multiple organ failure.7\u20139 Respiratory distress and encephalitis are the principal cause of death in patients with severe disease.10",

Shock was defined as a systolic blood pressure \u226490 mm Hg. The method of creatinine formation was Jaffe one. RIFLE classification was first reported in 2004, whereas AKIN classification, later or modified version of \u2018RIFLE\u2019 classification, was reported in 2007. We have usually used the RIFLE classification for AKI incidence in our institution because it can easily be applied when the baseline serum creatinine is known and has been largely validated in terms of determining the incidence of AKI. Furthermore, since we enrolled our patients from the year 2001, we used the original version for classification of AKI. AKI was defined and categorised according to the RIFLE classification.27 We used the serum creatinine level and eGFR to establish the RIFLE category because we had no data on the 6-hour and 12-hour urine volumes. If the baseline creatinine values were unknown, the serum creatinine was estimated using the MDRD formula and assuming eGFR=75 mL/min/1.73 m2 as the normal value. To evaluate the incidence, risk factors and clinical outcomes of AKI associated with scrub typhus, we divided the patients into AKI and non-AKI groups. To show the distribution of AKI cases, we annually evaluated the incidence of AKI associated with scrub typhus and compared it as an interquartile. On the basis of the occurrence of AKI, we also compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with CKD among those with scrub typhus in the AKI and non-AKI groups. We evaluated the severity of AKI categorised using RIFLE in the CKD versus non-CKD group.",
