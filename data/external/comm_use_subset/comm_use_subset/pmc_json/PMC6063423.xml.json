Surveillance of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) represent an important tool for tracking trends of virus spread and changes in globally circulating influenza viruses [5]. The first pandemic of the 21st century caused by influenza virus A/H1N1pdm09 demonstrated the importance of influenza surveillance worldwide. The monitoring of changes in seasonal influenza viruses plays a critical role in defining influenza vaccine composition [6, 7]. Moreover, data obtained from surveillance systems enables healthcare authorities to better understand timings of influenza activity and consequent mobilization of resources (e.g. vaccines, antivirals), notably prioritized vaccination of risk groups among other measures. However, limited data are available on influenza morbidity and mortality in Georgia [8\u201310] and none of these publications describe antigenic and genetic characteristics of seasonal influenza viruses circulating in the country.",

Individual patient questionnaires (including demographics, clinical signs, vaccination and antiviral treatment status) were completed prior to sampling and more detailed questionnaires (including treatment, chronic underlying conditions and complications) were completed for fatal SARI cases. Trained clinicians were responsible for completing the questionnaires and sending aggregated forms on ILI/SARI referral, at the end of each week, to NCDC&PH epidemiologists involved in the study.

DNA sequencing data were processed and assembled using Sequencher 5.0 software (Gene Codes Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan). Gene sequences of viruses from Georgia generated by Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre and CDC, and influenza viruses from various countries, were downloaded from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (http://www.gisaid.org). Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and analyzed using BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were estimated using RaxML v8.2X with a GTRGAMMA substitution model (https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html), followed by annotation with amino acid substitutions defining nodes and individual virus gene products using treesub (https://github.com/tamuri/treesub/blob/master/README.md).

During influenza activity periods weekly outpatient visits for ILI rose in parallel with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detection (Fig 2). Based on our data seasonal threshold was determined as an ILI referral of 231/100,000. The 2014\u20132015 influenza season had an unusually high referral of ILI cases which was considerably earlier than laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detection, presumably due to circulation of other respiratory viruses. ILI referral exceeded the threshold from week 40/2014 until week 14/2015. In 2015\u20132016 ILI visits exceeded the threshold from week 50/2015 to week 8/2016. For 2016\u20132017, in spite of the bimodal distribution of influenza circulation and a longer season, ILI referral exceeded the threshold for only weeks 43-51/2016 during the period of elevated A/H3N2 activity.",

Trivalent influenza vaccines for 2015\u20132016 contained a virus of the B/Yamagata lineage (a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus) while the vast majority of influenza B viruses detected in the European region were B/Victoria lineage [15]. Despite such lineage mismatch, immune responses to the vaccine can provide some cross-protection against infection by viruses of the other influenza B lineage [37]. Genetic studies of the B/Victoria lineage viruses revealed several substitutions in the HA and NA. Circulating viruses did not share the egg-adaptive substitution N197K in HA1, observed in egg-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 vaccine virus, but had the substitutions I117V and N129D in HA1. There were a greater number of amino acid substitutions in the NA but the significance, if any, of these substitutions is unknown.",

Influenza virus activity in the country was mainly observed from December through March each season with varying peak weeks and predominant viruses. On average one third of patients with ILI/SARI screened in each season had influenza virus infection. Among ILI cases influenza detection was highest in patients aged 5\u201314 years while the highest proportions of influenza-confirmed SARI cases were among adults. Persons aged 30\u201364 years had a higher risk of a fatal outcome. The observed circulation of antigenically and genetically variable viruses in Georgia and selection of A/Georgia/532/2015 as a reference virus by WHO CC, London illustrates the need for routine surveillance to contribute to the work of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.",
