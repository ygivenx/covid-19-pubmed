Patient data during the 2009 pandemic period were extracted from a multicenter cohort that investigated adult patients with confirmed H1N1-related critical illnesses who admitted to ICUs at 28 Korean tertiary or referral hospitals [15]. Among 57 critically ill patients of Samsung Medical Center and Asan Medical Center in the database, this study included 34 patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Samsung Medical Center (IRB application no. 2016-07-137) and Asan Medical Center (IRB application no. 2018\u20130224).

We used SOFA score to assess severity of patients because Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score were not appropriate in patients transferred from outside hospitals on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. SOFA score was assessed upon admission. Data about treatment in the ICU were also extracted, including antiviral agents, antibiotics, corticosteroids, MV settings (fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2], positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], inspiratory pressure, and tidal volume for predicted body weight), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, nitric oxide, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and ECMO. The predicted body weight was calculated using the following equations: predicted body weight (kilograms) for men = 50 + (0.91 * [height {centimeters}]\u2013 152.4]); predicted body weight (kilograms) for women = 45.5 + (0.91 * [height {centimeters}\u2013 152.4]) [8].

In-hospital mortality was 18% among patients in 2016 while it was 44% in 2009. The improved survival was associated with treatment year though there was no association between specific treatment modalities and improved treatment outcomes.",

This improved survival might be related to advances in ICU management. Regarding MV parameters, tidal volumes were lower in H1N1 patients of the 2016 influenza season compared to those of the 2009 influenza, despite no statistical significance. This may imply that intensivists have more tendency to recognize ARDS in a timely manner and adhere to low tidal volumes, which may influence improved survival in this study [17]. In this study, prone positioning seemed to be associated with increased mortality in patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure. However, it might have resulted from the phenomenon that prone positioning had been implemented to patients suffering from severe hypoxia, who were in the worst clinical settings. In addition, prone positioning showed decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality and increased ventilator-free days in patients with severe ARDS [18]. Thus, we should be cautious in interpreting the results.",

The reports were consistent with our finding that the proportion of patients receiving ECMO treatment increased from 15% (in 2009) to 21% (in 2016). In addition, in-hospital mortality of those who received ECMO was lower in 2016 (17%) than in 2009 (60%), although there was no significant association between improved survival and ECMO in a Cox proportional hazard model. In H1N1 ARDS, high tidal volumes (> 9 mL/kg for predicted body weight) and time of deoxygenation (Pao2 < 70 mm Hg) longer than 6 hours were associated with high mortality [20,21]. In this study, it was notable that tidal volumes for predicted body weight were significantly lower in patients receiving ECMO in 2016 than in those in 2009, which might explain the improved survival. Thus, prompt initiation of ECMO treatment should be considered when refractory hypoxia is not relieved by conventional treatment in severe H1N1 pneumonia.",

Our findings were aligned with previous studies, which reported early renal replacement therapy initiation strategy was not associated with severe acute kidney injury and septic shock or ARDS [22]. Also, other observational study revealed that long-term risk of major cardiovascular events in ICU survivors was more common in those who had received renal replacement therapy than in those who had not received renal replacement therapy [23]. However, since the study population who received CRRT in our study was small and there are no relevant studies which evaluated the role of CRRT in H1N1 patients with AKI, further studies are needed to confirm the role of CRRT in the treatment outcomes in this population.",

Patients in 2016 were more likely to receive lower tidal volumes than those in 2009 and treatment outcomes in patients who received ECMO in 2016 were better than those in 2009. However, these factors were not statistically significant probably due to the small sample size. Though it was not proven in this study, prompt ECMO and lung-protective ventilation may have led to advances in ICU management that have resulted in improved survival. Third, its small sample size made our study prone to selection bias. Multivariable analysis might not be enough to remove selection bias. Thus, future studies with larger study populations are needed to investigate specific treatment modalities to improve survival in acute respiratory failure patients with H1N1 pneumonia.",
