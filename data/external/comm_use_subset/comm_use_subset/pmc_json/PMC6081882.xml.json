It is reported that among children with pneumonia, 4\u201310% are caused by human adenovirus (HAdV). Liu et al. demonstrated that in China, HAdV are most frequently associated with pediatric severe pneumonia, accounting for 32.2% of severe pneumonia [8]. Additionally, HAdV it is the leading cause of death in severe pneumonia children [8]. Varying degrees of lung sequelae are noted in about 14\u201360% of HAdV infection caused pneumonia [9].",

The severity of lower respiratory tract infection caused by HAdV is related to HAdV types, age of onset, immune status, and environment [7, 12, 13]. Notwithstanding children and patients with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk for severe HAdV disease, most children with HAdV requiring hospitalization are previously healthy. In healthy children, most adenovirus respiratory infections are mild and indistinguishable from other viral causes. However, specific serotypes, such as serotypes human adenovirus type 3 (HAdV-3), human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV-7), and human adenovirus type 14 (HAdV-14) have been implicated with fatal outcomes [7, 14, 15]. HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 are the most common types in China, and HAdV-7 is more likely to cause severe pneumonia and significant mortality especially in infants and young children (6\u201324 months) [10].",

Thus far, HAdV surveillance in China is sparse, and some HAdV infections are chiefly identified during outbreak events. Researchers have tried to determine the impact of HAdV on severe pneumonia that requires hospitalization in the country, however, there is a lack of information regarding prevalence, genotypes, and molecular epidemiology of HAdV in China. To this end, in this study we investigated the relationship between viral load and pneumonia manifestations caused by HAdV in hospitalized children by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We intended to provide a method to pre-judge the disease severity in the populations with high risk of HAdV infection and to facilitate pneumonia treatment.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the clinical manifestations of 174 pneumonia children infected by HAdV and the relationship between HAdV load and pneumonia severity. The results showed that pneumonia due to HAdV usually occurred in children with 6\u201323 months old and represented more prone to fever, longer duration of fever, longer disease course, and higher incidence of severe pneumonia compared with pneumonia children infected by non-adenovirus, which were consistent with previous studies [9, 18]. IgG antibodies to HAdV were demonstrated to be acquired transplacentally in over 90% infants at birth. These antibodies may protect the infants from the infection of HAdV when they are less than 6 months. Complement-fixing antibodies of HAdV types are only detected in 14% of infants at 6 months after birth. The phenomenon of the reduced of HAdV antibodies corresponds to the increased incidence of HAdV infection in children more than 6 months old [12]. In the current study, we found no significant differences in the clinical manifestations in cough, wheezing, vomiting, and diarrhea between pneumonia children infected by HAdV and the other viruses. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the infection of HAdV and other viruses in children at the early stages of pneumonia by clinical features. However, our study revealed significant differences between children with HAdV infection and those with other virus infection regarding the length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit, oxygen requirements, and fatal outcome. If a child shows repeated high fever, long duration of fever, and the symptoms of respiratory infection, especially in children aged from 6 to 24 months old, pneumonia infected by HAdV should be taken into account. The limitation of this retrospective work was that for non-HAdV infection children, there was no clear distinction between other respiratory viruses infection. The interaction between specific viruses (e.g. adenovirus vs., rhinovirus and, adenovirus vs. respiratory syncytial virus) and identification of the independent effects of each virus increase understanding regarding the mechanisms of disease in viral coinfection. Previous studies reported that patients with HAdV infection commonly have a prolonged fever and a strong inflammatory response, resembling bacterial infections. Thus, on initial evaluation, it is difficult to distinguish adenoviral infections from severe bacterial infections [9]. This phenomenon may explain why so many antibiotics were prescribed. To date, the relationship between the clinical severity and infection status with single vs. multiple respiratory pathogens remains inconclusive. In our study, comparison of clinical characteristics of single HAdV and mixed bacterial infections revealed a longer duration of hospitalization in mixed bacterial infections, while oxygen therapy and the PICU admission rate did not differ between the two groups (Tables 1 and 2). This interesting phenomenon may illustrate the fact that multiple pathogen infection has a more effective mechanism for evading the innate immune response, resulting in slower pathogenic clearance. Further studies with larger populations comparing the severity and prognosis of CAP patients according to the type of virus as well as the different type of virus/bacteria combinations are needed.",

Some investigators reported a lack of association between viral co-infections and clinical severity in children with HAdV infections [19]. In another retrospective study by Korea et al., co-infections with other respiratory viruses were frequent in children with HAdV infections less than 2 years of age [20]. We also found the clinical symptoms of both HAdV single infection and virus co-infection to be largely nonspecific. Similarly, a study from Peru and colleagues also found no higher prevalence of any clinical manifestations in co-infected patients than in those infected with HAdV alone [21]. Our results showed no significant differences in age, which was consistent with previous reports from Korea [20]. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses, on the other hand, did not lead to the severity of pneumonia, the duration of fever and hospitalization. In addition, admission to the intensive care unit, and oxygen requirements did not differ significantly between HAdV infection only and co-infection groups. These findings have the clinical implication that in patients with severe pneumonia, the contribution of HAdV should be considered with high priority, regardless of whether another respiratory pathogen has been detected.",

The severity of pneumonia infected by HAdV is closely related to HAdV types. In China, the most common HAdV types were HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 [22]. HAdV-7 is more likely to cause severe pneumonia and represents highest lethality compared with other HAdV types in infants and children [18, 23]. In the present study, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were more frequently identified compared with other HAdV types, and HAdV-7 was the dominant serotype, accounting for 43.7% of children with HAdV infection. More than 50% of severe pneumonia children were infected by HAdV-7. Pneumonia caused by HAdV-7 was more severe compared with that caused by HAdV-1, HAdV-2, and HAdV-3, which was consistent with previous studies [18].",

            "text": "In addition to HAdV types, the severity of the disease is also related to age and the immune status of the patients. The risk of severe pneumonia infected by HAdV is increased in lower than 7 years old patients, immunocompromised patients, or patients with chronic underlying disease or post-transplanting [24]. In a retrospective case-control study in Singapore, Rajkumar et al. assessed 85 hospitalized children diagnosed with HAdV infections in order to investigate the risk factors for severe infection [13]. They found that HAdV-7 was associated with more serious infections in children and young age (< 2 years) and significant comorbidities were associated with more severe HAdV infection [13]. However, there are no reports describing whether HAdV load is involved in severe respiratory disease in China. For diagnosing viral pneumonia, upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens have become the most common specimen type due to their logistical ease of collection. There are reports arguing that, for some viruses, a higher viral load in the URT is associated with worse outcomes [25\u201328]. A recently study found a high HAdV load in the respiratory tract on day 5\u20137 after disease onset and sustained viremia for 2 weeks or more, which may be associated with fatal clinical outcomes in adults [29]. Adenovirus viremia has been found in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients and is associated with HAdV disease [30]. In this study, we carried out quantitative detection of HAdV, and then we combined the HAdV load with clinical symptoms to perform univariate analysis. Significant difference was noted in HAdV load between the patients with severe pneumonia and mild pneumonia. Further multivariate regression analysis of the severe and mild groups still showed that a high load of HAdV in the lower respiratory tract was associated with the development of severe disease. At the same time, age was an important factor that affected disease severity in the pneumonia group. Our study demonstrated that a high load of HAdV in the lower respiratory tract might be linked to the development of severe disease in children between 6 and 24 months. Additionally, it was illustrated that the types of HAdV were not statistically significant. The severe cases as well as the overall number of patients enrolled in this study might be relatively small, which, had a limiting effect on the statistical analyses. For example, it is possible that the comparison of pneumonia cases caused by HAdV-7 versus and other types would have statistical significance if the sample size was large enough.",
