The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus classified within the Arteriviridae family (Snijder et al., 2013). Since its emergence in the late 1980s, PRRS has been the most important threat to the global swine industry and is difficult to control through vaccination (Meng, 2000; Neumann et al., 2005). A better understanding of the virus\u2013host interactions will facilitate development of more effective control measures (Loving et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Stress granules (SGs) are discrete cytoplasmic protein\u2013RNA structures that are quickly assembled in eukaryotic cells when the cells are exposed to various stresses, including heat shock, starvation, oxidation, ultraviolet irradiation, hypoxia, and viral infection (Anderson and Kedersha, 2009). Four stress kinases have been identified that are involved in the SG formation when cells are exposed to distinct types of stresses: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) senses dsRNA during viral infection; protein kinase R\u2013like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) detects unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum; heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) monitors changes in heme levels; and general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2) senses amino acid starvation, ultraviolet damage, and viral infection (Yamasaki and Anderson, 2008). Activation of any of these kinases leads to the phosphorylation of the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), which inhibits the exchange of eIF2-GDP for eIF2-GTP. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 decreases the level of the active eIF2/tRNAiMet/GTP ternary complex, leading to the reversible inhibition of translation initiation and consequent polysome disassembly with a corresponding accumulation of the stalled 43S and 48S ribosomal preinitiation complexes (Mazroui et al., 2006). These complexes then recruit multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3-domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T-cell internal antigen 1 (TIA1), TIA1-related protein (TIAR), and many others, to nucleate SG assembly (Reineke and Lloyd, 2013). In addition to the most common SG assembly pathway described above, SGs can also be induced by eIF2\u03b1-independent mechanisms via the inactivation of translation factors (eIF4A or eIF4G) or the overexpression of SG components, such as TIA1 and G3BP1 (Kedersha et al., 2000; Tourriere et al., 2003). Although many pathways can result in SG or SG-like structure formations, the canonical SGs are defined by the presence of key translation initiation factors, mRNA and the small ribosome subunit (Dinh et al., 2013; Reineke and Lloyd, 2013).",

            "text": "Viral infection can certainly be viewed as a source of stress for cells, and several viruses have been studied to monitor their effect on the host stress response, especially how viruses modulate SG assembly. Many viruses have been reported to inhibit SG accumulation, such as Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) (Legros et al., 2011), Rotavirus (Montero et al., 2008), Influenza A virus (IAV) (Khaperskyy et al., 2012), Mengovirus, and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Borghese and Michiels, 2011). In contrast, several viruses, such as Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), induce the stable formation of SGs (Lindquist et al., 2010). Furthermore, transient SG formation is observed during the infection by some viruses, such as Encephalomyocarditis virus (Ng et al., 2013), Poliovirus (White et al., 2007), Coxsackievirus type B3 (CVB3) (Fung et al., 2013), and Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) (Qin et al., 2011). Growing evidence suggests that SGs, or at least SG components, may potentially function to repress productive viral infections. The propagation of some viruses, such as Measles virus (Okonski and Samuel, 2013), Japanese encephalitis virus (Katoh et al., 2013), Poliovirus (White et al., 2007), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Dinh et al., 2013), Mengovirus, and TMEV (Borghese and Michiels, 2011), can be impaired by SGs or their components. In the case of IAV, mutant IAV that lacks nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), but not wild-type IAV, efficiently generates SGs containing retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) together with viral RNA and antiviral proteins. Inhibition of these SGs results in an enhancement of IAV replication (Onomoto et al., 2012). Conversely, several viruses have been reported to benefit from SG formation. For example, RSV replication was impaired in cells with a reduced level of G3BP1 expression (Lindquist et al., 2010). Currently, the interplay between PRRSV replication and the cellular stress response remains largely unclear.",

Cells treated with the potent SG-inducer, sodium arsenite (SA), and mock-infected cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Monoclonal antibody specific for PRRSV N was used to detect PRRSV-infected cells. As expected, more than 95% of SA-treated cells contained SGs, while no obvious SGs were observed in mock-infected cells, which is consistent with findings from a previous report (McEwen et al., 2005). In PRRSV-infected cells, cytoplasmic granules containing SG marker proteins TIA1 or G3BP1 were not seen at 6 h post-infection (hpi) (data not shown), but they began to occur at 12 hpi and still existed at 48 hpi (Figures 1A,B). Based on the number of PRRSV-infected cells containing SGs, PRRSV triggered the formation of SGs in approximately 10% of cells at 12 hpi, 50% of cells at 24 hpi, and 90% of cells at 36 and 48 hpi (Figure 1C). These results suggest that a robust SG response was induced by PRRSV beginning at approximately 12 h after inoculation and maintained during the course of PRRSV infection.",

We found that, early in infection (12 and 24 hpi), hardly any eIF3\u03b7 foci were observed (Figure 2B, the third and fourth rows, respectively). Interestingly, at later times in infection (36 and 48 hpi), the amount of eIF3\u03b7 foci was almost as high as that of G3BP1 foci, and both proteins were recruited to the same granules in the PRRSV-infected cells (Figure 2B, the fifth and bottom rows, respectively), which is similar to SA-induced SGs (Figure 2B, the second row). Taken together, these results indicate that the composition of PRRSV-induced SGs is the same as that of canonical SGs.

The C16 compound and the nucleotide analog 2-AP are potent inhibitors of PKR activity (Hu and Conway, 1993; Jammi et al., 2003); GSK2606414 (henceforth referred to as PERK-I) acts as a highly potent PERK inhibitor by targeting PERK in its inactive DFG conformation at the ATP-binding region (Harding et al., 2012). No appreciable cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells was detected at concentrations of 0.25\u20131 \u03bcM for C16, 0.25\u20131 mM for 2-AP, or 0.5\u20135 \u03bcM for PERK-I, as demonstrated by the results of MTT assays (data not shown). To test the effect of these inhibitors on PRRSV-induced SG formation, MARC-145 cells were treated with 2-AP, C16, PERK-I, or vehicle for 1 h followed by PRRSV infection for 1 h. The inoculum was then removed, and the cells subsequently were maintained for 36 h in medium with each individual stress kinase inhibitor or vehicle. The cells were then fixed and stained with antibodies against TIA1 and PRRSV N to examine the formation of SGs. As shown in Figure 3B, an equivalent frequency of SG formation was induced after PRRSV infection in cells treated with 2-AP, C16, or vehicle. However, PRRSV-induced SG formation was substantially reduced in cells treated with PERK-I (Figure 3C, bottom row) compared with that in cells treated with DMSO. These results suggest that PERK rather than PKR is required for SG formation in response to PRRSV infection.",

As show in Figure 3F, infection with PRRSV resulted in a strong increase in the eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation level, which was diminished in cells treated with PERK-I, but not in cells treated with any of the other specific inhibitors or siRNAs. As compared with treated cells, no similar changes in the levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 were observed in the absence of PRRSV infection. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the total eIF2\u03b1 levels among the various treatments.

To assess whether SGs is associated with PRRSV growth, we tried to impair SG formation through concomitant knockdown of TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR. Firstly, specific siRNAs were designed to knock down the endogenous TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR, respectively. The knockdown efficiency was demonstrated by the results of real-time RT-qPCR and Western blot assays (Figure 4A). The specific siRNAs targeting TIA1, G3BP1 or TIAR were transfected into MARC-145 cells concomitantly, followed by PRRSV infection or SA treatment. Then SG assembly was monitored upon immunostaining of SG component eIF3\u03b7. In line with previous study (Bley et al., 2015), the concomitant depletion of all three proteins by siS, led to substantial SG disassembly in cells treated with SA (Figure 4B). Similar results could be observed in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating that SG assembly induced by PRRSV was aborted sharply when all three proteins, TIA1, G3BP1 and TIAR, were silenced together (Figure 4C, the bottom row). Besides, these cells were also fixed and stained with antibodies against TIA1, G3BP1, and TIAR, respectively, to confirm the efficient knockdown of each protein using indirect immunofluorescence assay (Figure 4C). Then cells were transfected concomitantly with TIA1-, TIAR-, and G3BP1-specific siRNAs, prior to PRRSV infection, and harvested together with the supernatants at 12, 24, 36, or 48 hpi, and plaque assays were performed to assess their titers. Unexpectedly, we found that simultaneous depletion of TIA1, G3BP1, or TIAR caused no significant difference in PRRSV replication compared with control levels (Figure 4D). These results indicate that SGs have no prominent influence on PRRSV replication.",

Interstitial pneumonia is considered one of the most remarkable features of PRRSV infection (Duan et al., 2014), and a large number of studies have reported that PRRSV infection induces inflammatory cytokine production in vivo and in vitro (G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2012). To investigate if SGs have a biological impact on PRRSV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, MARC-145 cells were transfected simultaneously with TIA1-, TIAR-, and G3BP1-specific siRNAs prior to PRRSV infection. Then the mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected by real-time RT-qPCR.

            "text": "Our knowledge about SGs has rapidly advanced in recent years. At least four distinct patterns of SG formation have been reported following infection with RNA or DNA viruses: stable, transient, oscillating, or no SG formation (Onomoto et al., 2014). For example, RSV triggers stable SG formation throughout the viral life cycle (Lindquist et al., 2010, 2011), while poliovirus infection causes a transient SG formation during the early phase of infection, but disperses the resulting SGs by cleavage of G3BP1 during later stages of infection (White et al., 2007). The levels of growth arrest DNA-damage-inducible 34 (GADD34) and the phosphorylated form of eIF2\u03b1 contribute to the oscillating SG formation in hepatitis C virus-infected cells (Ruggieri et al., 2012). In contrast, Mengovirus, TMEV (Borghese and Michiels, 2011), Herpes simplex virus (Khong and Jan, 2011), and Influenza virus (Khaperskyy et al., 2012) all restrict SG accumulation. In our present study, we found that PRRSV induces SG formation within 12 h of inoculation and that the frequency of SGs increases as the infection progresses, indicating that PRRSV specifically initiates and maintains the stress response in MARC-145 cells. Previous studies showed that the infection of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), both viruses belong to Nidovirales order as PRRSV, could also induce SG formation (Raaben et al., 2007; Sola et al., 2011). Whether it is a common feature of Nidovirales viruses to induce SGs requires future works.",

            "text": "Four mammalian serine-threonine kinases targeting eIF2\u03b1 (PKR, HRI, GCN2, and PERK) are involved in the stress responses to various environments. Abundant evidence indicates that several viruses commonly induce SG formation via the activation of PKR, or in some cases, via the activation of GCN2 (Berlanga et al., 2006; Lindquist et al., 2011; Okonski and Samuel, 2013), while other viruses block SG formation by preventing PKR activation, such as IAV (Khaperskyy et al., 2012) and West Nile virus (Courtney et al., 2012). Alternately, some viruses induce SG assembly, but the formation of SGs is abolished by PKR deficiency, such as hepatitis C virus (Garaigorta et al., 2012) and RSV (Lindquist et al., 2011). In the case of MRV, more than one eIF2\u03b1 kinase is required for the induction of SGs (Qin et al., 2009). The results of our study demonstrate that inhibition of PERK, but not of PKR, HRI, or GCN2, completely abrogates SG formation and decreases the eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation level in PRRSV-infected cells, indicating that PERK is responsible for PRRSV-induced SG formation. Indeed, previous studies of other research groups had showed that PRRSV infection upregulated phosphorylation level of PERK (Huo et al., 2013) and the phosphorylation level of PKR was not well correlated with that of eIF2\u03b1 in MARC-145 cells (Wang et al., 2016). Furthermore, knockdown of PKR using specific siRNA had no significant effect on PRRSV-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Wang et al., 2016). These results suggested that PKR is not responsible for PRRSV-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent SG formation, which is consistent with our conclusion.",

For example, expression of a cleavage-resistant G3BP1 restored SG formation during poliovirus infection and significantly inhibited virus replication (White et al., 2007). Similarly, depletion of TIA1 resulted in enhanced VSV growth and gene expression (Dinh et al., 2013). Conversely, RSV induces host SG formation to facilitate viral replication (Lindquist et al., 2010). Here, we found that, like RSV, PRRSV induces stable SG formation; however, unlike in RSV, impairment of SG formation almost had no influence on the replication of PRRSV. Similar results were previously obtained in MHV, which was reported to induce phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and SG assembly, but MHV replication does not benefit from the stress responses (Raaben et al., 2007).",

Many signaling proteins are sequestered by SGs and/or affect their assembly, which alter diverse signaling pathways (Kedersha et al., 2013). In our study, we found that the SGs are involved in the signaling pathway for the PRRSV-induced inflammatory response. In PRRSV-infected cells, impairment of SG formation by the concomitant knockdown of three SG components (TIA1, TIAR, and G3BP1) increased the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 concomitant with an increased phosphorylation level of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit. Interstitial pneumonia is the most remarkable characteristic of PRRSV infection, suggesting that the inflammatory response plays an important role in the infection and pathogenesis induced by PRRSV. Inflammation is also a two-edged sword for the host. Impairment of SG assembly enhanced the expression of PRRSV-induced inflammatory cytokines to some extent, indicating that SGs may be a host defense factor against the PRRSV-induced inflammatory response, even though it is not involved in PRRSV replication.",

At 36 hpi, the cells were fixed, stained with antibodies against PRRSV N, TIA1, G3BP1, TIAR, or eIF3\u03b7, followed by staining with Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG for TIA1, TIAR, or eIF3\u03b7, Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for G3BP1, Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for PRRSV N. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The stained cells were examined by confocal microscope. The percentage of SG-positive PRRSV-infected cells (up) and average number of SGs per cell (down) were quantified. Error bars show standard deviations. The arrows point the SGs in cytoplasm. (D) MARC-145 cells are treated as described in (C). Then the cells and their supernatants were collected together at the indicated times post-infection to determine their viral titers by plaque assay.",
