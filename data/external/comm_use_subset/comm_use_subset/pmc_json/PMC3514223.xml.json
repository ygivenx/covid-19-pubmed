Despite the fact that these WHO case definitions are sensitive and useful for clinical diagnosis, the pathogenesis of severe disease is not well understood. One disadvantage of the WHO clinical definitions is that they lack the specificity required to carry out studies aimed at understanding the pathogenesis of clinically different forms of childhood malaria.",

Small sample sizes, a lack of validation cohorts and a focus on a small selection of host plasma proteins have limited these studies. To overcome such limitations we use a systems approach to define the plasma proteome profile during malaria infection and identify distinctive patterns that are characteristic of different disease states. Contrary to other proteomic approaches, high-throughput plasma proteome profiling enables simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples. Therefore plasma proteome profiling allows the use of statistical pattern-recognition methods to discover and validate proteome-patterns that discriminate disease states.",

The malaria-negative children, the controls, are Disease Control (DC) and Community Controls (CC). We followed the WHO criteria for severe P. falciparum malaria [10]. Cerebral malaria cases were defined as children in unrousable coma for at least one hour in the presence of asexual P. falciparum parasitemia with normal cerebrospinal fluid. A Blantyre coma score less than 2 was used to assess coma status. Children with hypoglycemia were excluded from the study. Added to the strict clinical and laboratory definitions of CM, our study patients recover consciousness after effective antimalarial therapy. We excluded from this study those CM patients who died. Our overall mortality rate for CM is of the order of 10%. Severe malarial anemia cases were defined as conscious children with Packed Cell Volume (PCV) less than 16% in the presence of P. falciparum parasitemia. We excluded from this study those SMA patients who died. Our overall mortality rate for SMA is less than 1%. Uncomplicated malaria cases were defined as febrile children with P. falciparum parasitemia who did not require hospital admission. Our study was designed to discover and validate plasma proteome changes in dichotomous cases for which we only included those children with CM and UM with PCV greater than 20% (Table 1). We excluded from the study blood culture positive cases. Although we did not carry out blood cultures in all severe malaria patients, the cases recruited into this study are those in whom septicemia was not suspected and who were successfully treated with antimalarial alone.",

We selected as a final classifier the one that produced the highest accuracy and was then tested on the validation cohort data.

A set of proteins that are present, absent or at a different level in the samples defines a proteome-pattern that may discriminate between two or more of the study groups. To discover such patterns we applied statistical pattern recognition algorithms to the profiles and the selected number of discriminating proteins for each of the pairwise group comparisons is shown in Figure 1, as the numbers in parentheses (Data S1). We built predictive models with the selected proteome-pattern for each study group comparison using a non-parametric supervised learning statistical framework. The discriminatory accuracy of these predictive models in the discovery cohort groups is shown in Figure 1a.

The reduction in the complexity of each fraction of the plasma samples resulted in a larger subset of proteins that improved discrimination between the malaria syndromes. Sets of proteins that distinguish between SMA and CM groups (Figure 5a, f1 to f6 in brackets) slightly outperformed the proteome-pattern from non-fractionated plasma. Sets of proteins differentiated the CM and UM groups with accuracies ranging from 70 to 80% (Figure 5b, f1 to f6 in brackets) and distinguished between SMA and UM with comparable accuracy (Figure 5c, f1 to f6 in brackets).",

The plasma proteome differences are specific for the malaria disease process and not surrogate markers of acute illness, as we are able to accurately distinguish between malaria-negative ill children and malaria-positive groups independently of their disease severity.
