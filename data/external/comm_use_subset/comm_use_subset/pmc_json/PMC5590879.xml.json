In Western countries, control of commensal rodents relies heavily on the use of anticoagulant rodenticides (antivitamin-K, AVK). Anticoagulant rodenticides were first introduced in the 1950s but resistance rapidly appeared in rat populations [11] and more effective AVK compounds, called \u201csecond-generation\u201d anticoagulants, were developed during the 1970s and 1980s. The main mechanism of resistance to AVK in the brown rat is associated with mutations within the gene coding for the vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase enzyme (VKOR), located on chromosome 1 in brown rats [12].",

The urban landscape presents physical barriers that may reduce rat movements and subpopulation connectivity. Urban brown rats seem to show a strong site fidelity [14] with a relatively small home range. The axial dispersal distance of rats seldom exceeds 45\u201362 meters on ground [14, 18], probably three to four times more within the sewer system [19]. Understanding and tracking the population ecology of urban rats can provide important insights into factors influencing pathogen persistence, spread, and evolution [17].",

Manufrance live-traps (280x100x100 mm) were used, baited with a mixture of peanut butter, oat flakes, and sardine oil [25]. Traps were set in two sites: North (site 1) and South (site 2) (Fig 1). Distance between the centroid of the two sites was approximately 700 m. Traps were spaced 20 m apart whenever possible given physical constraints of the landscape (Fig 1). Geographic coordinates for each trap location were reported from a GPS device (Garmin eTrex\u00ae, precision 3\u20137 m). Since rat sightings were often reported during daytime hours, two trapping periods were organized, i.e. a night-time and a daytime session, covering all 24 hours of the day. Traps were checked twice daily, 07.00\u201311.00 (rats caught at night) and 18.00\u201321.00 (rats caught in the daytime), and baited as necessary. For each day and night of trapping, we recorded for each site the number of traps set, rats trapped, and traps sprung (e.g., traps sprung or damaged by people, trapping of non-target species).",

Helminths from the general body cavity were searched macroscopically. In 80/86 rats, helminths were collected from the digestive tract (from esophagus to rectum) under binocular lenses (x6 magnification). Up to 100 helminths were counted individually. If the helminth count was >100, the whole organ content was put into a Petri dish, worm count was conducted on half of the surface and the number was doubled to get the total number of worms in the organ. Helminth identification was based on morphological analyses of drawings using a light microscope equipped with a camera lucida (x40 \u2013x100 magnification). If the number of helminths was < 30 per host, then all helminths present were individually identified, a subsample was used if the helminth count was > 30 per host. Nematode species identification referred to Ribas et al. [46], del Rosario Robles et al. [47], Durette-Desset [48], Hugot and Quentin [49], and Anderson et al. [50].

Significance of FIS (excess or deficit in heterozygotes) was assessed using 1,000 permutations of alleles. Calculations and tests were conducted using Genetix v.4.05.2 [62]. The genetic structure of the sample was investigated using correspondence analysis adapted to individual diploid genotypes implemented in the Genetix software [62]. Genotypic linkage disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of unlinked microsatellite loci was tested using the Markov chain method implemented in Genepop v.4.2 [63]. We corrected for multiple testing using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) approach [64] implemented in R v.3.2.2 [59].

For each individual, we inferred its probability of being a resident using a Monte Carlo resampling procedure. Individuals with a probability lower than 0.01 were excluded as resident.

This hypothesis is supported by the high degree of LD between microsatellite loci and a relatively high genetic diversity (He = 0.628 \u00b1 0.069). Increased linkage disequilibrium can originate from a recent mixing of individuals from several subpopulations that have different allele frequencies, a spatial structuring into several subpopulations, or a bottleneck event [80]. Based on genetic analyses, there was no evidence of a recent bottleneck or substructuring into several subpopulations in our sample. Accordingly, we suggest that LD may have been caused by a recent colonization of the park by genetically differentiated subpopulations followed by high mixing of individuals from these populations. As noted in Slatkin et al. [80], the mixing of individuals from different subpopulations that have different allele frequencies creates LD and the decay of LD under recombination alone can be greatly retarded.",

There was an excess of heterozygotes (negative FIS values in 9 out of 13 microsatellite markers) indicating probable outbreeding [82]. Furthermore, four first-generation migrants were detected, all males, most likely coming from outside Chanteraines park. Fine spatial-scale analysis of the genetic relatedness showed that the population was spatially structured in small demes of related females. These data indicated differential dispersal behavior between sexes, with females dispersing less than males at smaller distances (< 30 m). This strongly suggests a male-biased dispersal and female philopatry, in accordance with other genetic [14, 15] and ecological studies [83, 84] on brown rats.",

Allelic diversity at the Mhc-Drb immune gene and microsatellite loci was low. The low polymorphism observed at Mhc-Drb may imply lower resistance to pathogens [85, 86] and may relate to the high parasite diversity and burden in this rat population. We lack comparison data on other urban brown rat populations, however Rattus sp. from Southeast Asia, the area of origin of Rattus sp. [2], had a much higher genetic diversity in Drb genes and microsatellite loci [30, 87]. Reduction in neutral (microsatellite loci) and adaptive (MHC loci) genetic diversity may originate from bottleneck events. It can also derive from one or several successive founder events (i.e. when a small number of individuals found a new population in a new area) and can occur in fragmented, small, isolated populations (such as urban populations which typically live in a fragmented habitat [88]) where substantial genetic drift induces reduced genetic diversity [85, 89].",

This suggests a regular immigration of rats from neighborhoods (where rodenticides are in use). More probably, our findings indicate a usage of AVK rodenticides in the park, in spite of the ban. Warfarin and flocoumafen are not marketed in France and, as expected, no residues of these molecules were detected. AVK concentrations were widely variable, from 2 ng.g-1, the lower limit quantifiable by the method, to 1,425.3 ng.g-1. Most rats (30/41, i.e.73.2%) presented a total AVK residue liver concentration below the threshold of 100 ng.g-1, considered as the lowest estimate for a no-effect concentration on blood coagulation in susceptible rats. Because second generation AVK can persist several months in rat liver [90], high frequency of hepatic AVK residues can most likely be explained by a past exposure to rodenticides. Only three rats showed liver residue concentration > 100 ng.g-1, which is capable of inducing a toxicological effect. Two Y139F/Y139F homozygous rats presented a difethialone concentration of 1,425.3 and 580 ng.g-1. One heterozygous rat Y139F /- presented a brodifacoum liver concentration of 472.1 ng.g-1.

The mean parasite burden was 3.3 parasites per host, with 87.5% of the sampled rats carrying at least two parasites. These results reveal high species richness in parasites of R. norvegicus and confirm that co-infection in hosts is the rule, not an exception [91, 92]. Furthermore, the presence of several potentially zoonotic pathogens (R. microstoma, H. diminuta, Bartonella sp., Rickettsia sp., F. tularensis, Leptospira sp.) raises the role of urban rats in the maintenance and spread of potentially zoonotic pathogens to humans and to other animals in Chanteraines.",

Statistical evidence of a significant association between these two intestinal worms was found. Syphacia muris is primarily a rat-to-rat transmitted species [93] whereas H. spumosa is a parasite of rats, mice, and occasionally hedgehogs [94]. Similarities in the life cycles and transmission routes of these helminths can lead to their co-occurrence in the same host. For both species, infestation occurs through oral ingestion of infective embryonated eggs. However, H. spumosa is more typically a soil-transmitted helminth species (eggs are excreted in the feces) whereas female oxyurid nematode S. muris deposit its eggs on the perianal region of the host [95, 96]. Even though common factors may drive co-infestation by both species, our models did not show analogous risk factors of occurrence of these two helminths. These findings may reflect that other epidemiological factors influence the infection patterns of the two worms.",

The field work was conducted by rodent experts, and different baits were tested. However, despite these efforts, the number of captured rats was low. Rats in the Chanteraines park were known to be abundant and many visitors reported rat sightings during the day time. Administrative and financial constraints did limit the time dedicated to field work (the park was closed to the public during 12 days). Prebaiting could have enhanced the trap success but the trapping period was considered too short to include a prebaiting phase. Indeed, rats show neophobic behavior, particularly with unexpected objects [6]. However, if this avoidance is often overcome within a few days when resources are scarce [66, 103], aversion to new food can be exacerbated when resources are abundant [81]. Rats in Chanteraines had access to food provided ad libitum to the zoo animals and/or refuse left by visitors. This may explain why rats did not explore the food sources in the traps and thus our low trap success.",

A regular surveillance of rodent populations is essential to predict future disease prevalence and to identify emerging rodent-borne diseases. Moreover, some rat-borne parasites can be transmitted to the zoo animals and to domestic dogs (e.g., Leptospira sp.), and are therefore of veterinary concern. Rat abundance was lower in site 2 than in site 1 which may induce spatial heterogeneity in the risk of pathogen spill-over events. Trap success was higher during the day versus night, confirming visitor reports of daylight rat sighting, but surprisingly contradicting observations on R. norvegicus, considered as a nocturnal species mostly active at dusk and dawn [6]. Daytime rat activity increases the probability of encounter, and therefore the probability of direct disease transmission between rats and humans (or domestic animals), which represents an uncommon epidemiological situation [6].",
