Clinical symptoms of URI are highly variable and cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent or agents. Although the majority of URI are caused by viruses (69%; [3]), antibiotics are widely prescribed to treat symptoms. Antibiotics, which are of little or no benefit for viral infections, can contribute to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria and to higher costs for health care [4], [5], [6].",

Many rapid serological tests are not sensitive or specific enough to detect all infections. Enzyme immunoassays (EIA) generally show sensitivities of 85% and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assays show sensitivities of approximately 60 to 80% [7]. Although viral culture is generally accepted as the gold standard for diagnosis, PCR can be more sensitive [8]. In one study, rhinovirus culture detected infection in 40% of patients while rhinovirus PCR detected infection in 51.5% of patients [3]. Similarly, an influenza virus surveillance study showed that 18% of samples were positive by culture and 28% were positive by TaqMan-PCR [9].",

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is widely used for identifying virus and bacteria; however, a positive amplification is often verified by subsequent procedures that provide sequence information [8], [23], [24]. By using multiple probes against a single pathogen coupled with the proper amplification scheme, microarrays can serve as valuable tools for viral discovery, detection, genotyping and sequencing [13], [14], [21], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33].",

The majority of these approaches do not provide sequence information, utilize expensive equipment that cannot be easily transported, require a high level of expertise to operate equipment, require extended periods of time, or are not easily modified. Here we describe a rapid and sensitive genotyping assay and array for upper respiratory pathogen identification using standard amplification and hybridization techniques and electrochemical detection (ECD) on a semiconductor-based oligonucleotide microarray. This platform was particularly suitable for developing this assay because it supports custom probe synthesis, which permits oligonucleotides of interest to be tested empirically. Multiple, highly reactive probes that are specific for a particular organism can then be put on the array for further iterative evaluation. Content of the final assay can also be customized to suit diagnostic needs in different geographic areas. Finally, the ability to use electrochemical detection with semiconductor microchips eliminates the need for expensive and delicate optical scanning equipment [34], [35], [36]. Scanning of microarrays is typically labor intensive and a significant source of system noise that complicates the use of microarrays significantly; and has hampered the transition of these technologies into high throughput clinical scenarios by adding undue instrumentation cost and complexity. The ECD method of deriving signal from a microarray is extremely simple and provides a clear path to making microarray processing truly hands off throughout the entire process.",

Approximately 850 unique URI probes were included on the array with 12 to 13 replicates for each probe. The assumption for this methodology is that enough unique probes will produce specific signal in the presence of the labeled PCR products to result in a positive call. Multiple probes allow for genetic variability, especially with viral genomes, and also provide sequence information. In principle it is straightforward to substitute other organisms in these assays by synthesizing arrays with alternate probe specificity and alternate primer sets.",

The PCR amplification/labeling reactions took approximately 3.5 hrs with a peltier thermal cycler; however the reaction time was reduced to less than two hours using a LightCycler (Roche). Single-strand target was produced by adjusting the melting temperature of the forward and reverse primer pools to approximately 50\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C respectively. This 15\u00b0C temperature differential between primer sets allowed for a 50\u00b0C reverse transcription step followed by exponential amplification at 56\u00b0C. Increasing the annealing temperature of the reaction to 68\u00b0C, with 30 additional rounds of amplification, resulted in a predominantly one-way reaction favoring reverse primer extension. Biotin labeling occurred during amplification by incorporation of biotinylated dCTP/dATP in the reaction mix.

These images are a representation of hybridization signals (i.e. current) derived from the raw data. This is in contrast to conventional microarray technology where the data are derived from the image and subsequently analyzed. Signal is predominately seen in the respective block of specific probes for each organism with scattered background signal. Variation of signal intensity within a pathogen-specific block of probes resulted from: 1) variable biotin labeling due to amplicon size and GC content; 2) variation in probe-target interaction due to genomic variability; and 3) predictable and un-predictable nucleotide base-pairing characteristics of probes. To overcome these issues, we determined a specific genotype based on the average signal intensity of all pathogen-specific probes, which includes 12 to 13 replicates of each probe.

This genotyping assay uses the same protocol to detect both bacteria and viruses that produce upper respiratory clinical symptoms; and it relies on the simultaneous examination of numerous loci to differentiate one organism from another. Microarray technologies can provide a significant amount of information at disparate loci in a highly redundant fashion that is helpful when discriminating between similar or different organisms or compensate for cases where genomic variation can result in false negative signals. In this array design, probes were developed to be species and sub-species-specific and then crosschecked against databases to minimize the possibility of cross-hybridization of target with other probes or with contaminating host NA. Multiple probes per pathogen (approximately 30 to 100) were used to overcome potential variability in pathogen genomes and also to provide sequence information at disparate loci. PCR primers were designed to flank the conserved regions that contained multiple complementary probe sequences. They also were designed such that the one-tube RT-PCR reaction produced biotin-labeled, single-strand target for hybridization to arrays. Decreasing the number of primer pairs per multiplex RT-PCR also increased assay sensitivity. Greatest sensitivity was achieved with one primer pair per genome of interest.",

However, with this increase in sensitivity, we also observed a slightly higher background signal and also a specific pattern of binding of free biotinylated primers to some probes.

In addition, this type of microarray can easily be subdivided into multiple sub-arrays; e.g., 4 sectors of 2240 electrode features per array, which allows multiple assays on one array and provides significant cost savings. Also, because of the platform's flexibility, the array content and primer pools can easily be changed to reflect the needs of clinicians in different localities and different seasons. The high manufacturability of semiconductors and their adaptability to inexpensive electrochemical microarray readers, which are small and field deployable, make these assays much more powerful than simple Real Time-PCR systems. In essence, the array provides a much higher level of confidence in a result akin to DNA sequencing; and, in addition, upfront bioinformatics and judicious choice of probes and loci allow a greatly simplified and speedier analysis of complex organisms or mixtures thereof. Ghindilis et al. [35] have described electrochemical detection and the application of this technology on the CombiMatrix array platform. This platform is able to provide very similar sensitivity and reproducibility to state of the art fluorescent detection. Their analysis of data correlation between the electrochemical detection and standard fluorescent detection techniques demonstrated that the array-to-array correlation for both detection techniques is very high with an average correlation coefficient of 0.94 [35].",

We are addressing amplicon contamination by developing a cartridge format for amplification, labeling, and hybridization of target. This cartridge contains the amplicons and is disposed of after analysis [36]. With respect to amplifying genetic material from pathogens that are part of the normal flora, PCR amplification is highly sensitive and is only qualitative at best. Therefore, the assay may (as with any standard bacteriological test) report the presence of pathogens in the absence of establishing a direct correlation with disease. As reported by Konno et al. [42], the flora of a healthy individual can contain pathogenic species (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis). They detected these organisms in a group of healthy 0 to 6 year olds at approximately the same rate as in patients with acute upper respiratory infections. These organisms were also found in older healthy subjects (7 to 74 year olds) but at lower levels [43]; and they were also recovered at a higher rate in smokers than nonsmokers [44]. Clinicians must therefore verify the results of highly sensitive assays with patient symptoms that would suggest a bacterial infection. The inclusion of bacterial genetic markers for antibiotic resistance or virulence in microarray assays would also help guide the clinician in establishing an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment regimen.",

Probe sequence information was organized and stored according to organism type and sub-type; with the sub-type section of the probe name occurring before the main delimiter, the bar (\u201c|\u201d), and the type section of the probe name appearing before the dash (\u201c-\u201c), when present. Thus the types for Cases 1 and 2 are \u201cPosCntrl\u201d, and the sub-type for Cases 3 and 4 are \u201cCorona-229E\u201d and \u201cCorona-HK\u201d, respectively. The data could be further divided into individual amplicon-specific probes. Once broken down into their groupings, the average signal for each type and sub-type was calculated, presented and graphed as a simple bar graph in picoamps. For an average signal to be considered significant, it had to be greater than three standard deviations above the mean signal of the negative controls. This calculation is termed the Assay Cut-off and is graphed as a horizontal line along the bar graph for simplicity of presentation and interpretation. Through this method of analysis, multiple positive results may be detected in a single assay.",
