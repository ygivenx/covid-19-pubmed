The virus inactivation process is the most safety and critical steps in the production of FMD vaccines. For FMD vaccines, in particular, guaranteed safety is essential because any occurrence of the disease will have great economic consequences [4].",

These results came parallel to that mentioned by Razdan et al. [37] who recorded that infectivity titers of FMD \u201cO\u201d virus in maintenance cell culture medium was reduced by 2 log units on storage at 37\u00b0C for 12 h. It indicates that virus temperature interaction time at 37\u00b0C has an inverse effect on the virus infectivity. Heat treatments at 57\u00b0C and 77\u00b0C for a period of 15 min or longer time are suitable for complete inactivation of the virus. Heat treatment at 60\u00b0C inactivated FMD virus [38,39]. Heating the virus suspension at 56\u00b0C for 60 min reduces its infectivity [40]. At high temperature, may be done the destruction of virus receptors, which ultimately declined its infectivity. The \u201cO,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d and \u201cAsia-1\u201d serotypes of FMD virus may inactivated at 54\u00b0C for 1 h [41].",
