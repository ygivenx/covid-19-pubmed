A model of combining network with medicine has unique features, which goes beyond the obstacle of long distance and enables people to have access to the latest medical resources. As a result, telemedicine, such as remote consultation and telesurgery, have developed fast in the last decade. We can envisage that telemedicine has a wider application value at places inconvenient for people to reach, such as earthquake zones, aircraft carriers, and nuclear polluted areas.",
