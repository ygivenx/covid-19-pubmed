One of the most widespread human members of this family, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), is a common cause of cold sores but can also result in herpes keratitis1, a leading infectious cause of blindness, and herpes simplex encephalitis2, which has a high mortality even in patients treated with antiviral therapy. It is highly contagious and can be easily passed from individual to individual via direct contact. In addition, after primary infection, HSV-1 establishes a lifelong latent infection in sensory ganglia with periodic reactivation of the virus leading to both symptomatic and asymptomatic virus shedding3.",

            "text": "Electron microscopy (EM) and electron tomography (ET) studies of HSV-1 have revealed that virus particles have a spherical shape4, with diameter ranging from 155 to 240 nm, each containing an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 125 nm5,6, which contains the viral DNA. The structure of the highly ordered capsid complex has been studied extensively and is now well defined. A partially ordered layer of tegument proteins surrounds the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope encloses the nucleocapsid/tegument core. The envelope carries a set of glycoproteins that are essential for virus entry and viral morphogenesis. Among them, glycoprotein D (gD) mediates interactions with cellular receptors and initiates the cascade of events essential for HSV-1 entry into target cells7. The tegument is the most structurally complex layer of the virus, and so far, over 20 tegument proteins have been identified for HSV-1 (ref. 8). In particular, VP1/2 (also known as pUL36) is the largest tegument protein (>330 kDa) and is essential for HSV-1 entry and assembly9,10. Owing to the interaction of its carboxy terminus with the minor capsid protein pUL25, VP1/2 is often referred to as being a part of the inner tegument. With its binding partner pUL37 (refs 11, 12), VP1/2 plays an essential role in capsid transport on microtubules13. In contrast to VP1/2 and pUL37, one of the major tegument proteins VP16 is thought to reside closer to the viral envelope and be a part of the outer tegument. VP16 also interacts with VP1/2 (ref. 14) and induces transcription of immediate-early viral genes, thus playing an important role in the viral life cycle15. Owing to its multiple interactions with other viral proteins, VP16 has been proposed to serve as a central organizer for the tegument12.",

            "text": "Although it is now clear that the tegument is not as disordered as previously thought, its structure and organization are still poorly understood. Structural information is also missing on the distribution of specific glycoproteins in the virus envelope. EM studies of biological materials are often restricted to highly ordered structures and, therefore, cannot be used to resolve viral tegument and envelope organization. Moreover, although EM and ET are powerful tools to visualize overall physical structure, their ability to localize specific proteins is limited. Optical techniques do not suffer this latter disadvantage; however, they are limited by optical diffraction, with a typical lateral resolution of ~200 nm. This resolution is comparable to the entire virus diameter and thus too coarse to reveal structural information. Recently, a host of sub-wavelength resolution optical imaging methods have been developed to circumvent the diffraction limit16,17,18. These super-resolution methods include stimulated-emission depletion microscopy19 and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), such as photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM)20, stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy21 (STORM) and direct STORM (dSTORM)22. Although PALM20,23, stimulated-emission depletion24 or dSTORM25,26,27 have begun to be used in the investigation of viral replication and structure, their application in the context of virology research is still in its infancy.",

We then designed a model-based analysis of SMLM data and used particle averaging (a method routinely used in EM34) to reconstruct a high-resolution image and to determine the position of individual protein layers within the virus particle with nanometre precision. We additionally investigated the effect of the fluorophore linker size and compared immuno-labelling strategies in the context of model-based analysis. Finally, our data set confirmed and quantified the spatial offset of the capsid with respect to the centre of the virion.",

We thus searched for a second fluorophore that could be reliably used in combination with AF647 for imaging virus particles and tested AF647/ATTO532, AF647/AF546 and AF647/AF568 in a range of photoswitching environments.

Here, to aid identification of the virus assembly state, we produced a fluorescently tagged recombinant HSV-1 that genetically encoded the small capsid protein VP26 fused to mTurquoise and the envelope protein gM fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). We were therefore able to locate individual capsids and discriminate between enveloped and non-enveloped particles within the infected cells. AF647 and AF568 were then used to label envelope protein gD and tegument protein VP1/2, respectively. The capsid protein VP26 (shown in blue in Fig. 1b) was primarily present in the nucleus (where capsids are assembled) and, less abundantly, in the cytoplasm where the punctate pattern indicates the presence of individual capsids. The envelope protein gM (shown in yellow) was mostly present in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm and near the plasma membrane, as expected for a viral envelope glycoprotein that undergoes vesicle-based transport through the secretory and endocytic compartments of the cell35. dSTORM imaging of both AF647 and AF568 allowed the identification and characterization of structural elements of individual particles (tegument and envelope) directly in the infected cells and the mTurquoise fluorescence image was used to identify the particles that were capsid positive. Among the capsid-positive particles, two main types were observed: those containing both tegument and envelope (Capsid(+)/Tegument(+)/Envelope(+)) and others that were devoid of envelope (Capsid(+)/Tegument(+)/Envelope(\u2212)) (Fig. 1c). The particles exhibiting all viral components (Capsid (+)/Tegument(+)/Envelope(+)) displayed structures that were consistent with those observed in purified viruses (Fig. 1a). In particular, VP1/2 (tegument) consistently appeared to be contained within the gD layer (envelope). We observed no clear visual difference in the distribution of VP1/2 between virus particles that were envelope positive and envelope negative.",

By aligning the obtained particles, the localizations can be combined to reconstruct a high-density super-resolution image of a specific protein layer. Furthermore, with the large number of localizations obtained in the aligned data set, the radial distribution of the aligned localizations can be accurately retrieved and analysed to determine the position of this individual layer. For this, the radial distribution of localizations was fitted to a Monte-Carlo model of virus localization data set (Monte-Carlo-based virus (MCV) model, presented in Fig. 2b and Supplementary Note 2), developed assuming spherically symmetric virus particles. In this model, each viral protein is assumed to lie within a spherical shell described by two parameters: the shell diameter and the shell thickness. The model takes both the linker size and the localization error into account. The shell diameter and thickness are the structural parameters of interest and are both obtained by fitting, whereas the linker size and localization precision are first estimated and then fixed during the analysis (Supplementary Note 3). The shell diameter represents the average radial position of the protein of interest in a population of virus particles. On the other hand, the shell thickness obtained by our method is a result of several contributions: the actual thickness of the protein layer (the thickness of the shell shown in Fig. 2b), the variability of the diameter from particle to particle in a population of virus particles and any deviation from the spherical symmetry.",

In fact, we observe that for VP16, pUL37 and VP1/2, changing the labelling from secondary to primary resulted in a small reduction of the diameter (by 5\u201310 nm). This small reduction may be a result of the heavy loading of the tegument with large labels that occurs with secondary labelling, leading to an observed swelling of the particle.

Instead of being randomly distributed around the average radial position of the protein layer, the labels may have a tendency to stretch outwards, away from the centre of the particle, and therefore smaller labels admit a smaller bias. This results in an overestimation of the protein diameter due to the linker size, which is then more pronounced in the case of the secondary labelling. An additional ~20 nm on the diameter corresponds to ~10 nm on the radius, which is in agreement with the size of a single antibody. No significant reduction in the diameter of the protein layer was observed between the primary and the Fab labelling, suggesting that the precision of our measurements is not limited by the size of the labelling once the distance between the protein of interest and the fluorescent label is of the order of or below the size of a single complete antibody.",

Similarly, the thicknesses recovered by primary and secondary labelling for VP1/2 are in good agreement with each other. We note that for VP16 and pUL37, the use of secondary labelling did not allow the estimation of the thickness parameter. This highlights that the use of primary labelling allows the measurement of smaller thickness that secondary labelling cannot reliably determine. A thorough analysis of the effect of the linker size (Supplementary Note 5) showed that the shell thickness may appear non-determinable if the estimation of the linker size is incorrect. This analysis also demonstrated that the linker size for the secondary labelling is more variable (between 15 and 25 nm for this data set depending, on the protein labelled) than for primary labelling. This variability in linker size using the same labelling approach is very likely to introduce bias or non-determinable thickness when the linker cannot be estimated precisely. On the other hand, a linker size of 10 nm for primary labelling provided reliable and consistent results.",

On the other hand, the thickness of VP16 and pUL37 appear smaller than that of gD, which is consistent with the notion that there is much less plasticity in the virus tegument compared with the envelope layer. At the moment, we do not have a clear explanation as to the observed differences in the thickness for VP1/2 and pUL37. Reasons could include differential labelling efficiencies for the two proteins and dense packing of fluorophores on the small shell of VP1/2, increasing localization artefacts. An underestimation of the alignment error would also lead to an overestimation of the shell thickness (see Supplementary Note 4).

This approach is related in nature to that of a recent investigation of sub-virion protein distribution in the related herpesvirus pseudorabies virus46. In the latter work, the displacement between the centroids of the wide-field fluorescence patterns from dually labelled virions was determined with high precision.

We compared different antibody-labelling methods in the context of structural analysis and found that primary labelling offers the most robust readout of protein location. We found that errors in the estimates of linker size or localization error introduce bias in the analysis and this needs to be carefully considered when secondary labelling is used: for example, we found that linker lengths varied from ca. 15 to 25 nm depending on which protein was labelled; therefore, precise estimates may be difficult in a practical situation. In contrast, we found that primary labelling resulted in a reliable and constant linker length of 10 nm. Fab fragments offer potential for even shorter linker size. However, producing Fab fragments that retained sufficient binding specificity and/or affinity proved challenging for most of the proteins we considered. In future, other labelling techniques may offer more promising routes towards short linker size, for example, nanobodies48 or aptamers49. Furthermore, the effect of restricted rotational freedom is of great importance, as it affects the localization precision50. We show that for analysing purified virions, primary labelling offers a good compromise, introducing small to no bias and providing high localization precision.",

This observation suggests that the central domain of VP1/2 may directly interact with the capsid, similar to the C-terminus of VP1/2 (ref. 43).

We observed offsets in good agreement with data previously obtained by cryo-ET45. Our method is based on the superposition of two-dimensional (2D) dSTORM data obtained from several particles, and the analysis of radial distributions of the offsets taking the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the particle into account. The spatial offset between the capsid and several tegument proteins in a related alphaherpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, has also been reported in an elegant study by Bohannon et al.46 Our analysis expands on this approach, which uses conventional fluorescence imaging, through the application of super-resolution microscopy. Super-resolution microscopy provides detailed images of individual virus particles, and so it is possible to determine their centre with greater confidence and accuracy. For example, non-uniformity in the fluorescence signal that may arise from incomplete labelling, or geometric defects, are directly observable by SMLM but are hidden when using diffraction-limited imaging techniques. Although we did use conventional fluorescence data for the determination of the capsid centre, the high copy number of VP26 and the rigid structure of the capsid ensure that an isotropic signal is obtained from mTurquoise; therefore, the centroid of the ensemble localization provides an accurate determination of the capsid centre. Surprisingly, our measurements of capsid offset relative to pUL37 gave a larger value (24 nm) than relative to VP16 (7 nm), which is difficult to reconcile with the notion that these two tegument proteins are both co-ordinated by interaction with a similar region of VP1/2. However, it is well established that there is a significantly greater number of VP16 proteins per virion (>600) than either pUL37 or VP1/2 (both <200)53. Furthermore, VP16 interacts with several other tegument and envelope proteins in addition to VP1/2 (ref. 54). As the structure and orientation of pUL37 and VP16 within the tegument have yet to be determined, whether bound to VP1/2 or not, it is unclear whether this discrepancy in spatial offset for VP16 and pUL37 is a genuine reflection of a different intra-virion distribution of the proteins or not. Future studies with other specific antibodies against VP16 and pUL37 should clarify this.",

In principle, 3D SMLM imaging techniques can also be used, such as dSTORM with astigmatic55 or biplanar56 detection schemes. Our method retain the high lateral resolution of 2D dSTORM techniques while recovering 3D information by taking into account the spherical symmetry of the particle. The same approach is applicable for any spherical system, such as other complex viruses, including coronaviruses (for example, the SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, coronaviruses) and rotaviruses. However, the spherical symmetry is not an a priori constraint: any system is amenable to the methods presented here as long as structural information is available for accurate modelling of the SMLM data. For more complex structures, the alignment may require more complex algorithms, such as those reported for the alignment of nuclear pore complexes34. Another powerful approach to consider would be correlative imaging, combining optical fluorescence microscopy and EM as demonstrated previously57. This approach would potentially reveal structural information (notably on the capsid) to complement the molecule-specific fluorescence imaging.",

The protein labelled with AF568 was chosen such that it is located in a different structure than that labelled with AF647. When AF647 was used to label a protein present in the tegument, AF568 was used to label a protein in the envelope (glycoproteins). Inversely, if AF647 was used to label a protein from the envelope, AF568 was used to label a protein in the tegument. Virus particles present in the masked dSTORM image were then located by circular Hough transform70, allowing detection of circular structures and determination of the coordinates of their centre (see Supplementary Note 1).",
