            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are common and contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. They are the leading causes of outpatient visits and hospitalizations in all age groups, especially for children under 5 years of age.1 Most ARIs in children and outpatients are caused by nine common respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A, influenza virus B, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and boca virus2, 3 Additionally, atypical pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, are also major causes of ARIs in children. The symptoms caused by these pathogens are largely similar, thus definitive diagnosis requires effective laboratory testing. By using multiplex assay targeting these pathogens, early diagnosis can be made in a timely manner. Consequential antimicrobial or antiviral therapy may thus be administrated promptly and appropriately.4 Most importantly, the early diagnosis of influenza viruses, which are contagious, is beneficial for early isolation of patients, thus reducing the spread of influenza viruses.",

Given the poor sensitivity and complicated manual operation, these methods have been gradually replaced by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), which are more sensitive and more specific. However, majority of the NAAT kits are based on real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can only detect one or two pathogens of ARIs within a single tube, thus are not syndromic testing.5 The clinical and economic impacts of syndromic testing for respiratory pathogens have been evaluated in several studies. Overall, the implementation of syndromic testing can decrease the time of diagnosis,4 decreased healthcare resource utilization,6 decrease inpatient length of stay and time in isolation,7 and improve antiviral use for influenza virus\u2010positive patients.8\n",

This technique has been used for pathogen detection and subtype classification of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.13, 14 By comparing the results with a standard size marker of targeted pathogens, pathogens in samples can be separated and identified as expected.15 The subtypes of most viruses were not designed to be further distinguished by this assay, except for influenza virus A. The influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009) and H3N2 are the two subtypes which are most popular in China recently. Therefore, a patient whose specimen is positive for influenza virus A but negative for influenza virus A pdmH1N1 (2009) or H3N2 is probably infected by an uncommon influenza virus A, such as H7N9, H5N1, H5N6 avian influenza virus A16, 17, 18 and has to be immediately quarantined once it is confirmed. It should be noted that hospitals, not CDCs, are the first to reach such patients, so this assay helps hospitals identifying such high\u2010risk patients and make appropriate quarantine measurement in a timely manner to control further spread of avian influenza A virus.",
