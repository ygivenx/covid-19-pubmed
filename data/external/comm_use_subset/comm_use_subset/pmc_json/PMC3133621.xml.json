The adhesive activity of VWF is positively correlated with the size of the multimers in plasma [1], [2]. VWF multimer size is regulated by metalloproteinase ADAMTS13, which cleaves the central A2 domain of VWF at the Tyr1605-Met1606 bond [3]\u2013[4]. The importance of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 is demonstrated in two syndromes, i.e., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and von Willebrand disease type 2A. The former is associated with the deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity, either due to congenital mutations or acquired autoantibodies [5]\u2013[7]. The latter is mostly caused by mutations in the A2 domain of VWF that lead to the increased proteolysis of VWF multimers by ADAMTS13 [8], [9].",

SZ34 bound to native and pre-denatured full-length VWF, A1A2A3, and A2, but only native A2-12 and A2-23 (Table 2). Furthermore, the binding of SZ34 to the pre-denatured VWF and VWF fragments was much weaker than the native counterparts (Table 2). These data suggest that the epitope of SZ34 is conformationally sensitive. The binding site was mapped to the central A2 domain of VWF.

            "text": "Only two reports have been published showing the inhibitory effects of VWF antibodies on the proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13, but the mechanism of inhibition by SZ34 may be different from that of the two other mAbs VP-1 and RU8 reported by Tsai et al [15] and Zanardeli et al [16], respectively. The mAb VP-1, which was directly against residues 1591\u20131605 (inside VWF A2 domain) of VWF polypeptide, inhibited the susceptibility of the recombinant type 2A VWF mutants R1606W and R1606Q to proteolytic cleavage by ADAMTS13 under the static condition. But they did not examine whether VP-1 inhibited native pVWF or wild-type recombinant VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 [15]. Because VP-1 was raised against the synthetic VWF peptide (residues 1591\u20131605) and reacted poorly with the intact subunit (250 kDa fragment) of VWF in reduced SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting [3], [15], we speculated that VP-1 could not bind to native VWF and could not affect its proteolysis by ADAMTS13 without denaturization or under shear stress. In addition, Zanardelli et al [16] reported the inhibition of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 under shear by using RU8, a mAb directed against the VWF D4 domain. They suggested that a binding site in the C-terminal region (D4CK) of VWF is constitutively exposed and participates at the initial step of a multi-step interaction, ultimately leading to proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13. Thus, RU8 may inhibit VWF proteolysis by inhibiting the initial binding of the distal domains of ADAMTS13 to the C-terminal region of VWF. We found that the mAb, SZ34, bound to native VWF better than pre-denatured VWF at the central A2 domain, and decreased the cleavage of native VWF under shear stress, but not pre-denatured VWF under static conditions. These findings suggest that SZ34 binds native VWF-A2 domain, which may block the conformational change of VWF or block the access of ADAMTS13 to the ancillary binding site and cleavage bond located at the central A2 domain under fluid shear stress.",

Although a report found that recombinant VWF-A2 peptide (a.a.1481\u20131668) was sensitive to proteolysis by ADAMTS-13 under physiological pH and non-denaturing conditions [17], most of studies have shown that even for the isolated A2 domain, unfolding by high fluid shear stress or chemical denaturants such as urea and guanidine-HCl is required for proteolysis by ADAMTS13 [10], [18]. Thus, for VWF with its multi-domain structure, not only the inter-domain but also the intra-domain A2 structural changes have regulatory roles in ADAMTS13-mediated cleavage of VWF. Our data demonstrate that the epitope of SZ34, a mAb raised against native VWF multimers, is located within the A1555-G1595 region, which comprises the \u03b12-helix and \u03b13-helix according to the crystal structure of VWF A2 domain [19]. It is possible that part or all of the \u03b12-helix and \u03b13-helix structure of A2 domain is constitutively exposed on the native VWF multimers and is involved in the regulation of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13. Previous studies, however, considered that the A2 domain of VWF is normally sandwiched between the much larger A1 and A3 domains [19], [20], and the D1596-R1668 region in VWF A2 domain (the so called VWF73) is the minimal substrate for ADAMTS13 [21].",
