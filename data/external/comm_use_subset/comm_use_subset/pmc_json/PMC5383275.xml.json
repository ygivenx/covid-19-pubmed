About 300,000 babies are born with the disease annually. Jamaica is a Caribbean country where the prevalence of an abnormal haemoglobin gene is ~15% and one out of 150 babies born has a sickle haemoglobinopathy [2].",

Air quality has been shown to have a significant effect on acute pain in SCD where high levels of ozone (and low levels of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide were associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions [9,10]. Inhaled nitric oxide has been observed as possibly beneficial for acute vaso-occlusive crisis in pediatric patients [11], while zinc supplementation has been associated with decreased incidence of infections, number of hospitalizations, and vaso-occlusive pain crisis [12].",

In this project, we aim to utilize GIS technology to determine the environmental and social exposures of persons with SCD attending SCU and seek further understanding of their relationships, if any, to health outcomes in SCD. Specifically, we hypothesize that patient factors such as sex and genotype, and geo-social exposures such as rural/urban residence, poverty, mean temperature, rainfall, and elevation above sea level will have an association with common clinical presentations in SCD such as pain crises, respiratory problems and leg ulcers. Additionally, we wish to examine whether health care utilization, specifically annual attendance for routine, health maintenance care or attendance for acute care, is associated with patient factors, such as sex and genotype and other geo-social variables, exposures such as distance patients travel to seek health care at the SCU, at what age patients first registered at the SCU, and how long they have been attending the SCU.",

Whereas the burden of SCD lies in low and low-middle income countries with tropical climates, most studies examining environmental influences have been conducted in higher income countries, which also happen to have more temperate climates [26]. This paper examines in great detail many of these socio-environmental influences on health outcomes in SCD. Jamaica has one of the oldest comprehensive care centres for SCD, and as it is a tiny island, many persons living in the island may opt to seek care at the SCU facility. The maps presented also highlight this point as there is a cross-island distribution of persons registered at the SCU. It is significant that rural persons\u2019 access to clinic for health maintenance did not differ from urban persons as they apparently see value in these visits. Rural persons had higher prevalence of the more severe genotypes and might be possibly due to the fact that ones with milder genotypes do not make the effort to attend for healthcare. Additionally, the rural clinics are held only once monthly (this is a limitation of this study as the rural sample might be underrepresented), and so it is understandable why their annual rate of total attendance to the SCU is lower than that of their urban counterparts. Rural persons especially have to travel large distances to seek care and they continue to present later for care. Hence there is a need for more facilities to be developed where SCD specific care will be available,and greater access to SCD care more proximally may decrease that gap and possibly improve outcomes.",

Even though Jamaican males are generally known to have poorer health seeking behaviours [17] associated with worse health outcomes, the SCD males had similar rates of annual health maintenance visits but higher rates of annual total visits when compared to SCD females in this study. Males had higher prevalence of leg ulcers (similar to what exists in previous literature [27,28]) and respiratory events. They also tended to have their first episode of significant pain crisis, respiratory event and leg ulcerations at lower ages than girls did. As most of these complications of SCD began in early adolescence, a hormonal role may be implicated in explaining this sex difference in clinical outcomes.Further studies are needed to continue to explore these differential outcomes between males and females.",

Higher annual rainfall and higher temperatures were associated with lower prevalence of all three clinical outcomes examined. Persons who lived further distances from factories also had lower prevalence of painful and respiratory events. Further research would be needed to dissect the possible implications of this finding. The effects of higher altitude (as assessed by elevation above sea level) disappeared once temperature was added to the models. It has been widely reported that exposure to cold in persons with SCD results in higher pain experiences [7,8,10,26] and our results corroborate these findings even within a narrow range of tropical temperatures between 25\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C. Environmental pollutants are increasingly being understood as being causative in disease, especially respiratory and allergic conditions [29,30]. There may be direct effect of particle components on generating added reactive oxygen species and further driving oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [31]. As these latter mechanisms are already implicated as being patho-biological in SCD [32], then the effect of environmental pollutants in SCD is probably multiplicative. These findings are critical in ongoing education among patients and families and advising preventative measures, especially in avoiding cooler temperatures and living close to factories and exposure to other means of air pollution. The effect of higher rainfall being consistently and independently protective against these clinical outcomes seems counterintuitive but will need greater study. Studies in the U.K. [33] and France [10] have found no influence of rainfall on outcomes whereas previous study in Jamaica has shown a positive association of rainfall with painful events [7].",
