Therefore, early diagnosis of HAPE is essential to initiate early treatment of HAPE and maintain the safety of people who ascent to high altitude. Although international and Chinese criteria have been established for HAPE [5], its early detection and diagnosis are difficult, except in the presence of typical pulmonary edema. Following the magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck Yushu (Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China) on April 14, 2010, approximately 50,000 rescuers assembled in the region. This region lies at an altitude ranging from 3700 m to 4900 m, the average altitude is 4,493 m. Although the incidence of HAPE is only 2\u20134%, the sudden influx of nonacclimatized rescuers to the region meant that HAPE was one of the most common life-threatening diseases at that time, even considering the effects of the earthquake, which caused 1944 deaths, with 216 people missing and 12,135 injured.",

            "text": "It is generally not difficult for physicians to diagnose typical HAPE, which is based on medical history, symptoms, and signs including white, yellow, or pink frothy sputum, moist rales on pulmonary auscultation, and flocculent shadows on chest X-rays. However, atypical HAPE is much more difficult to diagnose. Patients usually develop atypical HAPE at altitude <3000 m, which may occur several days or longer after ascending to altitude. Symptoms differ from those of typical HAPE, such as less sputum or an absence of sputum and nonspecific findings on chest X-rays. Based on a previous study [6], the development of HAPE can be classified into two stages from the onset to the presence of typical symptoms. The early stage is characterized by interstitial pulmonary edema while the late stage is characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema. Patients with interstitial pulmonary edema do not usually exhibit serious dyspnea or typical signs such as pink frothy sputum, extensive moist rales, or wheezy phlegm. Thus, these patients are susceptible to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Li et al. [7] investigated the characteristics of HAPE in 482 patients. They examined the clinical symptoms and signs, and performed routine blood tests, electrocardiography, color Doppler echocardiography, chest X-rays, and computed tomography (CT) of the patients. They found that HAPE patients exhibited significant differences in these parameters compared with non-HAPE patients, and that the symptoms and signs were more obvious in HAPE patients than in non-HAPE patients. In addition, studies have revealed that oxygen treatment is more effective in HAPE than in other forms of lung injury. Therefore, some researchers have proposed that tentative oxygen treatment can be used for the early diagnosis of HAPE. Nevertheless, the most important examinations for the early diagnosis of HAPE are chest X-rays or CT. On chest X-rays, HAPE often presents as decreased pulmonary transmittance, increased or obscure lung markings, and ground glass-like changes in the lung, or patchy shadows. On CT scans, increased and enlarged lung markings, ground glass-like changes in the lung, nodule-like shadows, scattered or isolated alveolar edema of terminal bronchioles, and slim reticulate shadows can be observed.",

Thus, it is imperative to develop guidelines to standardize and optimize the treatment of HAPE. Based on the experience of several mountain sickness treatment centers and the efficacy of currently available drugs and strategies, in combination with recent advances in the treatment of HAPE, our research group proposed four regimens for early diagnosis and treatment of HAPE and conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to investigate their efficacy. A total of 400 patients with HAPE were divided into four groups and treated as follows: patients in group A received oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, and aminophylline; patients in group B-C were treated as in group A, in addition to diuresis with furosemide in group B, blood pressure-lowering with nifedipine in group C, or L-arginine in group D. The efficacy and safety of these therapeutic regimens were compared. The treatment showing greatest therapeutic efficacy was subsequently used to prepare the guidelines for the treatment of HAPE. Overall, all four regimens were effective for the treatment of HAPE [9]. However, in terms of the time to resolution of symptom and signs, the time to resolution of chest X-ray findings, and duration of hospitalization, regimen B was superior to the other regimens. Interestingly, there were no marked differences between regimens A, C, and D. Furthermore, there were no differences in the incidence of adverse effects between regimens A, B, and D, or in the liver and kidney functions between all four regimens. These findings suggest that a regimen composed of oxygen inhalation, dexamethasone, aminophylline, and furosemide is effective, well tolerated, simple to follow, and thus offers a basic, standardized regimen for the treatment of HAPE ",

Evidence shows that inhalation of 100% oxygen can significantly decrease the increased pulmonary artery pressure and is accompanied by improvements in symptoms [13]. In addition, oxygen inhalation can increase arterial oxygen saturation and improve tissue oxygen supply, thus alleviating hypoxia. For patients with severe HAPE, hyperbaric oxygen is preferred. Some researchers [14, 15] have proposed mechanical ventilation for patients with respiratory distress. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment not only increases the oxygen concentration and subsequently the alveolar and arterial partial pressure of oxygen, but also increases pulmonary ventilation and alveolar pressure, which inhibit fluid exudation.

Accordingly, we suggest that nitric oxide inhalation should be considered in the treatment of HAPE.

In addition, oral acetazolamide can play a significant role in the treatment of HAPE because it can increase urine output in patients with HAPE or fluid retention. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity in the brain, kidney, and blood. In the kidney, acetazolamide reduces the formation of hydrogen and bicarbonate ions and inhibits sodium bicarbonate reabsorption to increase urine output and, thus, reduce sodium and water retention.
