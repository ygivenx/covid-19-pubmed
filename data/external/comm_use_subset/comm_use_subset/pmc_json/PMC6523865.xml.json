            "text": "Neosporosis is a disease caused by apicomplexan parasites such as Neospora caninum and Neospora hugheshi [1]. Considering its morphology, N. caninum is quite similar to Toxoplasma gondii, so neosporosis was misdiagnosed as T. gondii infection until 1988 [2]. Although the morphologies are quite similar, these parasites are biologically different and are considered as zoonotic compared with toxoplasmosis where it affects human, sheep and many other warm-blooded animals [3]. Neosporosis infection occurs from unsporulated oocysts in feces followed by ingestion by the cattle, transformation from the tachyzoites stage to the sporozoites stage and leading to neosporosis in the cattle [4]. Recrudescence of the infection occurs in pregnant cattle, where this parasite is transmitted from the placenta to the unborn fetus and may lead to abortion [5,6].",

Most of the specific antigen proteins are secreted from each organelle and are located at the apical end of the N. caninum parasite and have been extensively studied as recombinant vaccine candidates against N. caninum infection [7,8]. In our previous study, we demonstrated the capability of baculoviruses displaying N. caninum-derived antigens, such as surface antigen 1 (NcSAG1), SAG1-related sequence 2 (NcSRS2) and microneme protein 3, as an alternative method to control neosporosis because the combination of three antigens could induce T-cell activation and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) production and suppress N. caninum infection in mice [9].",

Interestingly, profilin is known as a small actin-binding protein located at the apical end of N. caninum tachyzoites and is essential for invasion of the host cell by regulating the polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments [11]. Furthermore, Jenkins et al. [12] and Mansilla et al. [13] revealed that T. gondii profilin binds to Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11) in mice and is responsible for activating dendritic cells and stimulating the release of cytokines such as interleukin 12 (IL-12) and IFN-\u03b3. According to Innes et al. [14], some cytokines help in controlling the infection by inhibiting parasite multiplication.",

Previous studies of recombinant NcPROF have not dealt with the expression fusion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV. Therefore, to evaluate the expression and purification of fusion native NcPROF fused with an N-terminal PA tag, fused with the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori (bx-PA-NcPROF) fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV (bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM), NcPROF was expressed in two other NcPROF constructs, one fused with a PA tag (PA-NcPROF) and PA-NcPROF fused with the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori (bx-PA-NcPROF). The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified from silkworm hemolymph and the binding of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM with recombinant mouse TLR11 (mTLR11), and the morphological analysis of the nanoparticles were reported.",

            "text": "The molecular weight of native NcPROF in this study was similar to that of full-length profilin expressed in E. coli (22 kDa) [12]. This finding suggests that PA-NcPROF expressed in silkworm larvae may be not modified posttranslationally. bx-PA-NcPROF was observed in the fat body and hemolymph at 25\u201330 kDa as a large obscure band that appeared as two bands. The molecular weight of the lower band was the same as that of PA-NcPROF and that of the upper band was larger than that of PA-NcPROF. This finding suggests that bx-PA-NcPROF may be partially modified posttranslationally after the cleavage of the bombyxin signal peptide. In fact, N128 was predicted as an N-glycosylation site estimated by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/). The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM product was observed at 30\u201340 kDa by western blotting. Interestingly, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was observed in the hemolymph and culture medium although it was fused with the transmembrane domain of GP64. In our previous report, N. caninum-derived antigens NcSAG1 and NcSRS2 fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 were not observed in hemolymph [9]. In this study, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted into hemolymph, in part, and the culture medium from Bm5 cells. It has been reported that profilins of T. gondii and Babesia canis were partially secreted even though no signal peptide is predicted in these genes [20,21]. In this study, NcPROF was also secreted regardless of the addition of the signal sequence. To investigate N-glycosylation of the N-glycan of three NcPROFs, PNGase F treatment was carried out (Figure S1). Molecular weight of each NcPROF was not changed between before and after the PNGase F treatment, indicating no N-glycan was attached into the three NcPROFs. These results suggest that the two bands of bx-PA-NcPROF did not come from its N-glycosylation. Hence, it showed that the bx-PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM were not posttranslationally modified with an N-glycan in endoplasmic reticulum even though these proteins have the bx signal peptide. In addition, the discrepancy of the molecular weight of each PROF to its estimated that was not caused by the N-glycosylation. In nature, estimated pI of this NcPROF is around 4.89, which may have influence on the mobility of NcPROFs on the SDS-PAGE gel [22]. In addition, the negative charge of acidic residues may create repulsion and this repulsion caused the anomalous migration of protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gels [23]. This may be the reason why the molecular weight of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was increased.",

NcPROF induces limited protection and the T-cell response in mice [13]. In this study, NcPROF expressed in silkworms was investigated to determine whether it binds to recombinant mTLR11. The binding of purified bx-NcPROF-GP64TM to mTLR11 was not clearly observed compared with that of the negative control. Because bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM formed multimers under nonreducing conditions, DTT was then added to purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM before ELISA (Figure 5A,B). As shown in Figure 5C, the specific binding was enhanced by an increment of almost 72.7% after DTT treatment and simultaneously increased the binding ability when different concentrations (100, 300, 500 ng/well) were challenged. Hence, it suggests that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM expressed in silkworm larvae is functional. These results indicate that multimer formation might prevent bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM from binding to mTLR11. Similar to the results of a previous study, Hedhli et al. [27], showed that PROF of T. gondii secreted into Drosophila S2 cell broth with the signal sequence of insect binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) enhanced the cellular and humoral responses in mice after DTT treatment. These results indicate that bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was secreted through the secretory pathway in the host and irregular disulfide bonds were formed in the endoplasmic reticulum.

            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) could be recovered from the culture supernatant when VSV-G alone was expressed in mammalian cells [24,25]. Similarly, the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was incorporated into exosomes when its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were replaced with those of VSV-G [29]. Extracellular vesicles containing virus-encoded glycoprotein were secreted into the culture supernatant when mammalian cells were infected with the modified Vaccinia virus Ankara strain [30]. Additionally, glycoprotein 64 (AcGP64) of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus was secreted into the culture medium when AcGP64 was expressed in mammalian cells [31]. In this study, it is possible that the bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM protein formed nanoparticles when it was expressed in silkworm larvae and Bm5 cells. In our previous paper, antigens of N. caninum fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 were displayed on the surface of BmNPV particles, but few of these fusion proteins were secreted into silkworm hemolymph [9]. These studies suggest that the secretion of recombinant fusion proteins with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 depends on the properties of recombinant proteins of interest. Currently, nanoparticles were only observed in purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM but not in the other two constructs. Additionally, when purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was treated with 1% TritonX-100, some of this protein moved to the fraction at low sucrose concentration during sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Figure S3), implying that this fusion protein forms nanoparticles. We are investigating whether these nanoparticles are aggregates or not and how these nanoparticles form.",

[32], stated that delivery of the subunit antigen using particle-based delivery systems can lead to significant improvement in immunogenicity because these systems have now been enhanced by engineering through the physiochemical properties of the particle to promote an immune response. Hence, it was advantageous to purify bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM because it naturally forms unique functional nanoparticles without modification through its physiochemical properties to deliver subunit antigens through a particle-based delivery system. Antigen-displaying nanoparticles have been normally prepared by the co-expression of viral structural proteins and antigens or chemical conjugation and genetic fusion of antigens to virus-like particles [33,34]. In this study, NcPROF-displaying nanoparticles were prepared in insect cells and silkworm larvae only by expression of bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM, which has the bombyxin signal sequence and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of BmGP64 at its N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively.",
