Aberrant glycosylation of membrane\ncomponents due to specific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity is a common feature\nof carcinoma cells and is usually associated with invasion and metastasis of cancer. For\nexample, GCNT2, which is a gene-encoding glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2, contributes\nto breast cancer metastasis with preferential expression in basal-like breast cancer (2). ST6Gal-I expression in ovarian cancer\ncells promotes an invasive phenotype by altering integrin glycosylation and function (3). Since aberrant glycoproteins as a\nresult of these enzymes may be involved in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis, these\nenzymes could also be used as cancer biomarkers (4). Therefore, cancer-specific changes in the expression of\nglycosyltransferases exhibit the most marked and consistent change of activity in\ntumorigenesis.",

Several reports indicate a complexity in\nglycosyltransferase activities which lead to several tumor associated carbohydrate\nstructures in gastric carcinoma. Glycosyltransferase mRNA expression has been found to be\nsignificantly altered in gastric carcinomas isolated from surgical specimens (5). Upregulation of\nglycan:sulfotransferase activities and downregulation of \u03b1,2-fucosyltransferase\nactivity appear to be associated with human gastric tumori-genesis (6). Shimizu et al(7) confirmed that \u03b14GnT, which\nforms a unique glycan, GlcNAc\u03b11-->4Gal\u03b2-->R, is detectable\nin 80% of 5 patients with an early stage of gastric cancer and the expression level\nof \u03b14GnT mRNA is increased in association with tumor progression. Recently,\n\u03b23Gn-T8, which can extend polylactosamine on N-glycan, was also reported to be\ninvolved in malignancy in gastric cancer cells (8).

All ppGalNAc-Ts in mammals are type II transmembrane\nproteins that have a Golgi lumenal region that contains a catalytic domain with\nglycosyltransferase activity and a C-terminal R-type lectin domain (9). The human ppGalNAc-T family contains\nmore than 18 members, each of which has unique transferase activity, different peptide\nsubstrate specificities, and dissimilar patterns of expression (10,11). Among all the ppGalNAc-Ts identified in mammals thus far, the\nppGalNAc-T2 gene was highly expressed in cancer and may play an important role in the\noccurrence and development of tumor. Brooks et al(1) reported that levels of ppGalNAc-T2\nexpression may change with the differentiation of breast carcinoma. Mandel et\nal(12) showed that\nppGalNAc-T2 expression was strong in poorly differentiated tumors. It has also been\nconfirmed that ppGalNac-T2 is involved in vanadium-induced HL-60 cell differentiation (13). Moreover, both acute T cell leukemia\nJurkat cell lines and human heptocarcinoma HepG-2 cell lines clearly express ppGalNAc-T2\n(14). The invasion and metastasis\nof human glioma cells can also be regulated by ppGalNAc-T2 (15). Our previous studies revealed that ppGalNAc-T2 expression\nappears to be higher in gastric cancer SGC7901 cells than in other poorly differentiated\nhuman cancer cells, indicating that ppGalNAc-T2 may play a vital role in the process of\ngastric cancer emergence and development. However, a comprehensive understanding of how\nppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the invasive potential of human gastric cancer is not currently\navailable.",

Thus, this study was undertaken to evaluate the role of\nppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by creating stable transfectants and\nevaluating them for invasive and metastatic potential in vitro. In order to\nelucidate the role of ppGalNAc-T2 in the gastric cancer metastasis process, SGC7901 cells\nwere treated with ppGalNAc-T2 sense or antisense vectors and examined for the following: i)\nthe relationship between the ppGalNAc-T2 expression and the cell proliferation, adhesion,\nand invasion ability, in order to clarify whether ppGalNAc-T2 is correlated with SGC7901\ncell metastasis-associated behavior; ii) the impact of ppGalNAc-T2 on MMP-2, MMP-14 and\ntransforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 regulation including mRNA and protein levels, to\ninvestigate the molecular mechanisms of the anti-metastasic activities in human gastric\ncarcinoma. These data suggested that high expression of the ppGalNAc-T2 gene in gastric\ncancer SGC7901 cells might exert anti-growth and anti-metastasic activity through the\ndecrease of MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21. Our findings indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 is useful in\nregulating gastric carcinoma invasion and metastasis, and this may be used as a novel\napproach for cancer therapy.",

Mucin-type linkages (GalNAc\u03b11-O-Ser/Thr) of proteins begin\nwith the addition of a single GalNAc monosaccharide to a serine or threonine residue on the\npolypeptide. Attachment is catalyzed by a family of glycosyltransferases called the\nUDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts, EC\n2.4.1.41), which is a crucial regulatory step (17,18).\nThese structural changes can alter the function of the cell, and its antigenic and adhesive\nproperties, as well as its potential to invade and metastasize. PpGalNAc-T2, an important\nmember of ppGalNAc-Ts, is often variable in cells of different types and differentiation,\nand the expression may change in cancer cells (12). Herein, we investigated the mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T2 in\nseveral human poorly differentiated cancer cells, including SGC7901 gastric cancer cells\n(19), SHG44 glioma cells (20), SHI-1 leukemia cells (21), A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells\n(22), and HO8910 ovarian cancer\ncells (23).

The SGC-7901 human gastric cell line was first established\nfrom the metastatic lymph node of a 56-year-old female patient suffering from gastric\nadenocarcinoma (26). To examine the\npotential anti-metastasic effects of ppGalNAc-T2, proliferation, adhesion and invasion\nassays were performed on SGC7901 cells. Regardless of the exact mechanism of ppGalNAc-T2 in\nthe cell metastatic process, pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors or pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2\nantisense vectors were transfected into SGC7901 cells to reconstitute the expression of\nppGalNAc-T2, focusing on the changes in the characteristics of cell metastasis-associated\nbehavior. In ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells (SGC7901-T2s group), proliferation, adhesion,\nand invasion were decreased compared with untreated SGC7901 cells, whereas the values for\nthe same assays were increased in ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells (SGC7901-T2as group).",

Among the many MMPs that have been identified, MMP-2 encodes\nan enzyme which degrades type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement\nmembranes. MMP-14 activates MMP-2 protein, and this activity may be involved in tumor\ninvasion (30). Thus, we examined the\neffect of ppGalNAc-T2 on the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-14 in SGC7901 cells. Our study\nrevealed that expression of ppGalNAc-T2 had an inverse correlation with the expression of\nMMP-2 at the mRNA and protein levels. It is highly likely that ppGalNAc-T2 regulates the\nproliferation, adhesion, and invasiveness, all of which are essential steps for the\nestablishment of metastasis of SGC7901 cells, due to the regulation of the MMP-2 signaling\npathway. However, it did not exhibit any apparent correlation with MMP-14 expression. MMP-14\nhas been shown to interact with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) (31). Further experiments are required to\ndetermine if ppGalNAc-T2 functions in SGC7901 cells, in part, by TIMP-2 signaling\npathways.",
