A basic assumption underlying the EpiBasket project is that most of the essential questions that are needed today were posed in the past, and that those providing the results published in the best scientific journals should certainly be considered as the best possible candidate questions. Three steps were defined to stock the catalogue with questions.",

This identification relied on a systematic review of the pertinent papers published in the domain. To facilitate the extraction of those variables, we supposed that they were mentioned in the tables and figures of the papers analysed in the systematic review. The manual extraction of those variables that we performed to build the prototype could subsequently be automated, with natural language-analysis tools (8) \u2018reading\u2019 the tables, figures and their corresponding legends. A relational database comprising all extracted variables was constituted. It allows tracking of the context of the variable, for example, to immediately find the sets of variables that are usually used together.",

In the real world, very few authors provide their questionnaires, hence the \u2018question\u2019 had to be inferred from the \u2018variable\u2019. Therefore, the second stage was to deduce the \u2018question\u2019 from the \u2018variable\u2019 identified in the previous step. For example, the questionnaire may have asked the date of birth, while the paper may report the corresponding results in a table showing age-class frequencies. In addition, EpiBasket can propose a recommendation for a preferred coding, with the aim of maximising the chances of interoperability among databases constituted with EpiBasket-derived questionnaires and their responses.",

It was accomplished by replacing words or patterns found in the reviewed papers by \u2018root terms\u2019 that the user would replace with the specific term that fits the event of interest. For example, the question \u2018In the case of a SARS outbreak, would you avoid going to the cinema?\u2019 provides a template for asking questions regarding avoidance behaviours during an outbreak. Now, using \u2018root terms\u2019, it is formatted as \u2018In the case of #$DISEASE outbreak, would you avoid going to #$PLACE?\u2019, where #$DISEASE and #$PLACE are the root terms to be instantiated by the user selecting this question template, for example, \u2018In the case of a cholera outbreak, would you avoid going to a restaurant?\u2019 So far, six root terms have been implemented in the current EpiBasket prototype: \u2018#$DISEASE\u2019, \u2018#$DRUG\u2019, \u2018#$NUMBER\u2019, \u2018#$PERIOD\u2019, \u2018#$PLACE\u2019 and \u2018#$SOMEONE\u2019.

The underlying assumption is that, when the user will have to choose among several questions (e.g., choosing among several scales available for scoring burnout), the one with the best \u2018value\u2019 will be retained. Since such a logical view is likely to be followed by most EpiBasket users, EpiBasket should facilitate better standardisation of questionnaires. At present, we arbitrarily decided to give to a question the value defined as the \u2018Best IF\u2019, that is, the highest journal IF encountered among all papers using it. This choice assumes that, if the user has to choose between two burnout scales, the one previously published in a high-profile journal will be preferred. As a consequence of this valuing system, all demographic variables (e.g., age, sex) get a high value (because they are used in all papers, including those published in journals with very high IF). IF can be systematically obtained from the Journal Citation Reports database, for which a fee must be paid. However, most journals provide their IF on their websites and we used those values in the prototype (see the Supplementary file). The value of 0.000 was arbitrarily assigned to questions published in journals not indexed in the Journal Citation Reports database. Researchers not wanting to take these IF into account can just ignore the \u2018values\u2019 indicated when they build their questionnaire.",

LimeSurvey (13) is an open-source online-survey application written in PHP, based on a MySQL, PostgreSQL or MSSQL database, and distributed under the GNU General Public License.

The goal is not only avoiding that epidemiologists \u2018reinvent the wheel\u2019 when they are faced with situations similar, or partly similar, to those the past. It also strives to indirectly encourage more standardised and better quality questionnaires. Another indirect attribute of the proposed approach is to promote interactions among epidemiologists. Indeed, despite informatics advances, which make it easy, at least in theory, to devise databases easily sharable and accessible from any place, the fact is that, in practice, this is not yet reality (15). The main reason is likely to be found in human factors. However, the tool we present has integrated the potential to stimulate collaborative approaches.

They represent a small part of the epidemiological investigations done during/after an outbreak and a full-size EpiBasket should provide questions for all fields concerned. After the 2003 SARS epidemic, we identified (7) at total 10 fields other than KAP belonging to three categories: Investigation and Surveillance (four fields: description of the outbreak, search for causative agents, transmission studies, risk factors), case management (five fields: clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and medical interventions, prognosis, medical decision-making), and prevention and control. Thus, the EpiBasket prototype described herein is far from what a full-size \u2018EpiBasket\u2019 could be. The design and computer implementation of that ideal project would require a workforce (i.e., epidemiologists and software engineers) that exceeds the resources of a single research group. We think the software aspect is likely the easiest, as it was shown here that the efforts already made in the profitable field of e-commence can be relatively easily adapted to epidemiology. The future editorial and organisational aspects are much more difficult to foresee. The editorial work covers the definitions of the means applied to \u2018value\u2019 the questions. For the prototype, we chose the best journal IF among published papers on similar events that used the question. It is also possible, for example, that an Editorial Committee would prefer a mechanism according high values to questions submitted by experts in the field. In that scenario, coding recommendations should certainly be made by subcommittees. One of the organisational issues concerns copyrighted questionnaires, particularly those that are available only for a fee. The current EpiBasket version does not address such issues.",
