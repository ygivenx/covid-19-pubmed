Some special features of their morphology, physiology and behaviour make bats unique in their role as reservoirs and distributors for pathogens; above all is the ability of active flight, which enables the spread of pathogens over long distances [2,3]. Over the last decades, bats have been suggested or identified as reservoir hosts for several viruses of considerable human and animal health concern, such as Marburgvirus, Hendra, Nipah or SARS viruses [4\u20136]. Previous studies have also shown that bats might be sources for bacterial pathogens such as Leptospira spp. [7], Salmonella spp. [8], Yersinia spp. [9] or Bartonella spp. [10].",

            "text": "Besides commensal strains, the species E. coli comprises several zoonotic pathovars causing intra- and extraintestinal diseases in humans and animals, such as diarrhoea, septicaemia, urinary tract infections or meningitis [14,20]. While much is known about the prevalence and pathogenic potential of E. coli in humans and domestic animals, little is known about E. coli in wildlife. Few studies reveal mainly commensal strains in captive wild animals [21,22], whereas others reported zoonotic and potentially extra intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains originating from wildlife, indicating that wildlife might serve as a source or reservoir of virulent E. coli strains [13,23\u201325]. However, to which extent pathogenic E. coli from bats might be of zoonotic relevance is difficult to assess, as data on the phylogenetic types, e.g. determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), are not available. Food represents one of the main infection sources for intestinal pathogenic E. coli and there is also scientific support for foodborne infections with ExPEC [26,27]. As bats provide a considerable protein source for people in many African countries [28\u201330], it would be highly desirable to get more insight into the prevalence and genetic background of E. coli from these animals. Another important aspect is that wild animals have increasingly been recognized as carriers and putative distributors of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli [31\u201335]. Indeed, bats have been shown to harbour AMR E. coli, demonstrating that they can be considered an important pool for genetic material of bacteria [17,23,36,37].",

[53], we defined E. coli isolates as ExPEC based on the presence of \u22652 virulence associated genes (VAGs) including P fimbrial genes papA and papC, S frimbriae genes sfa/foc, afimbrial adhesion genes afa/dra, group 2 polysaccharide capsule gene kpsMTII and iron acquisition gene iutA. However, many VAGs were only discovered after the \u201cExPEC-definition\u201d had been suggested in 2003 or were found to be of relevance in ExPEC infections after this time point [54\u201360]. We used a second scheme to categorize the remaining strains based on the presence of at least five ExPEC related genes and termed them \u201cExPEC-like\u201d. Of note, this categorization is just for practical reasons and does not suggest anything about the strains virulence. Genes included encode for groups II and K1 capsule (kpsMTII, neuC) adhesins (ea-I, hrA, sfa/foc, tsh), toxins (cnf, hlyA, hlyC, hlyF, vat, and sat), invasins (ibeA), iron acquisition systems (chuA, sitA, sitD, etsA/etsB, eitA/eitB, fyuA, ireA, iroN, irp-2, iucD), a pathogenicity island marker (malX), ColV plasmid (cvi/cvaC), protectins (iss, ompT) and a polyketide synthetase (pks) (S2 Table). Isolates not fulfilling any of the above criteria were termed commensals. Following these definitions, we identified four ExPEC strains from different organs of three bats. Another 12 isolates fulfilled the criteria of ExPEC-like strains, while 18 isolates were termed commensals.",

Instead, there are multiple and redundant pathogenic mechanisms in this group of opportunistic pathogens. Although probably oversimplifying this complexity, we used a previously suggested molecular definition of ExPEC [53] as an initial basis to identify ExPEC among our bacterial samples. This identified four ExPEC strains from three individuals. Further investigation including the genes ea-I [59], ibeA [60], pks, vat and sat [54,55] as well as hlyA, cnf [57] revealed 12 ExPEC-like strains from 11 bats based on the presence of at least five ExPEC-related genes as described in the material and methods section. The pathogenic potential of the isolated strains has not been evaluated in this study, thus a final statement about pathogenicity cannot be made. In the same way, virulence cannot be completely ruled out for strains classified as commensals.",

Additionally, ST69, ST101 and ST127 also predominantly consist of human ExPEC strains and have been associated with severe disease [82\u201385]. However, the virulence features of the isolated strains were much less pronounced, indicating these particular strains of STs as being less virulent compared to their counterparts circulating in the human population. Only a few strains with a suggested virulence (according to VAGs and STs) were identified, which would still have to be verified in pathogenicity studies. Also future in depth comparative whole genome sequence analyses are needed to provide insight into the microevolution of this interesting strain collection.",

Considering that fruit bats, including the species investigated here, are frequently hunted as bushmeat, there exists ample opportunities for direct pathogen transmission, e.g. through preparation and consumption. In addition, several fruit bat species have adapted to human environments where they can exist in large populations and where the potential for contact is likely higher than in the current study through environmental contamination, including food markets. Like many other wild animals, bats therefore should also be considered as an additional source for E. coli with pathogenic potential.",

            "text": "None of the isolated strains, including those typically associated with ESBL-production (ST69 and ST131) [81,82,86\u201388], showed any resistance towards the tested antimicrobial agents. The result is not surprising as mainly human proximity is suggested to be responsible for presence and increase of antibiotic resistances in animals [13,33,89,90]. Bats of this study all derived from areas with very low human population density and thus a low likelihood of human to bat transmission of E. coli. This indicates that known human strains appear to be more frequently found in wild animals as originally assumed as part of the na\u00efve E. coli population. Interestingly, only very few of the STs isolated showed intermediate resistance to certain antimicrobial substances tested. This, together with the predominantly arboreal lifestyle of the fruit bats of the present study, points towards a rather \u201cna\u00efve\u201d population of E. coli in the fruit bats studied here. Even the presence of a ST131 strain fits into this picture. This phylogenetic lineage of E.coli has received a lot of attention in recent years; on the one hand due to its worldwide success in circulating in different hosts, on the other hand due to its association with ESBL resistance. Whole genome analysis revealed that this particular ST131 strain rather belongs to an evolutionary older clade within the ST131 phylogeny that is usually not associated with antibiotic resistance. The high number of novel STs also reflects a more na\u00efve population. However, further studies including whole genome sequencing and evolutionary analyses should be performed to describe the E. coli diversity circulating in wildlife\u2014particularly in the understudied tropical setting.",
