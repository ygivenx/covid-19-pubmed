Virion-associated host proteins could be grouped into several functional categories, such as cytoskeletal proteins, annexins, glycolytic enzymes and tetraspanins [20]. TSG101 protein is critical for HIV budding [22]. APOBEC3F exerts its antiviral effect by means of blocking HIV replication [23,24]. Cyclophilin A which impairs the early stage of the viral replication is essential for HIV type 1 virion infectivity [25-27]. Cofliln, Tubulin, heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 and Hsp70 were also detected in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [28], while \u03b2-actin was identified to interact with infectious bronchitis virus M protein, subsequently confirms to play important roles in virion assembly and budding [29].",

Subsequently, the opalescent PRRSV particles band was harvested and loaded onto 25-65% sucrose gradients. The higher density particles band in 35-45% soucrose gradient was collected and purified for a second time according to the same PRRSV purification method. The purity of virus preparation was directly examined by transmission electron microscopy following negative staining (Fig. 1). The PRRSV samples contained an abundance of virion particles without obvious contamination from host cellular material. For further identification of the virions protein composition, the purified virions were first separated by SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie blue, three bright lanes (nucleocapsid protein N, membrane protein M and glycoprotein GP5) and three faint lanes (GP2a, GP3 and GP4) were found (Fig. 1).

In this study, the critical challenge was to prove that the host proteins were really an integral part of the virions and are not just non-specifically attached to the outside of the virions or derived from the contaminants. To address this question, the negative control of non-PRRSV infected Marc-145 cells lysates were purified using the same method as described earlier for PRRSV virions. Equal amounts of purified PRRS virions, protease-treated PRRSV virions purified Marc-145 cell lysates were included for Western blot analysis. Five structural proteins (GP2a, GP3, GP5, M and N) were identified in highly purified PRRSV virions. As shown in Fig 3, Beta actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, S100 and Hsp27 were detected in purified virions and protease-treated virions. In addition, we detected no Annexin A2, S100 and Hsp27 in the negative control. Otherwise, it is an expectable result that we detected actin and tubulin in the non-viral infected MARC-145 cells lysate which might because of their high concentrations in all cells and subcellular fractions. The results revealed that the selected proteins are specifically packaged into PRRSV virions rather than contaminated proteins.",

By doing so, the microvesicles become lighter than the virions and virions can be isolated by density centrifugation. Proteins present inside the virion are protected by lipid envelope and therefore will be present after the protease treatment. Virus particles were incubated with antibodies of Beta Actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, S100, Hsp27 and normal mouse IgG (Fig. 4) which were later on developed with a gold-conjugated secondary antibody. Binding of gold particles to PRRSV was then observed which showed the presence of many gold particles located on the surface of PRRSV virion for Beta actin, Tubulin and Annexin A2, meanwhile one or two gold particles on virion surface could be seen for S100 and Hsp27. However, almost no gold particles were established in PRRSV virions which were incubated with normal mouse IgG. The results indicated that the numbers gold particles were consistently related with proteins abundance in gel.

Interestingly, actin was originally thought as a cellular contaminant, but later demonstrated to be an internal component of the measles virus [33,34]. The functional implication for assimilation of actin into these virus particles remains ambiguous. Actin has been suggested to play a role in the transport of synthetic viral RNA, which is presumably a prerequisite for budding [35]. In number of viruses, such as HIV and moloney murine leukemia virus actins are used to be very important during their budding [36-38]. Furthermore, actin and myosin form a dipolymer which play an important role in HIV 1 budding from host [39]. For influenza virus, actin plays indispensable roles during the endocytosis of the virus into polarized epithelia [40]. Beta-actin has been identified to interact with infectious bronchitis virus membrane protein and may play an important role in virion assembly and budding [29]. Keratin network is important for the intercellular transmission of persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and facilitates its own intercellular spread through the interaction between the viral nucleoprotein, keratin 1 and stimulation of cell-cell contacts [41]. Cytoskeletal filaments vimentin, cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, actin, hair type II basic keratin and PRRSV receptor mediate the transportation of the virus in the cytosol [42]. Therefore, host cytoskeletion actin may play essential role in PRRSV budding or assembly.",

Annexin A2 is a calcium-regulated membrane-binding protein whose affinity for calcium is greatly enhanced by anionic phospholipids and implicated in a number of membrane-related events, including regulated exocytosis [43]. It binds calcium ions and may be involved in heat-stress response. Cellular annexin A2 was found to be endogenously associated with HCMV, HIV, influenza virus particles, and herpes simplex virus 1 [18,20,44,45]. HCMV-associated annexin A2 contributes to cell penetration by the virus, and is acquired during virus egress from infected cells and is bound to anionic phospholipids expressed on the virus surface, which may contribute to membrane binding and fusion events required for virus entry [44]. Annexin A2 as a cellular cofactor interactes with phosphatidylserine that eventually promotes HIV entry into MDM [46]. It is also demonstrated that annexin A2 interacts with HIV Gag at the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-containing lipid raft membrane domains, at which Gag mediates viral proper assembly in monocyte-derived macrophages, moreover ectopic expression of Annexin A2 in 293T cells increases HIV-1 production [47,48].",

Hsp27 was also reported in HIV and influenza virus [20,52], which was identified as a protein that specifically co-immunoprecipitates with HCV non-structural protein 5A and may be involved in HCV replication [53]. Hsp27 phosphorylation has been linked to an inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation, suggesting that Hsp27 plays a role in HIV-1 infection of macrophages [54]. Moreover Hsp27 was observed to be up-regulated in PRRSV-infected PAMs [55]. Furthermore, Hsp90 complex which is incorporated into nucleocapsids are required for Hepadnavirus assembly and reverse transcription [56]. Purified primate lentiviral virions contain Hsp70 [52]. Some stress proteins, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 are components for purified EBV virions and may regulate actin filament formation [28].

However, functions of these proteins in virus life cycle have not been well understood. Eukaryotic translation initiation factors are ATP-dependent RNA helicase which form an exon junction complex (EJC) in splicing exon-exon junctions of mRNA. Influenza virus NS1 protein recruits eIF4GI specifically to the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and act as a translational activator for virus mRNA [59,60].

Taken together, the selected proteins i.e., Actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, S100 and Hsp27 were demonstrated to incorporate into PRRSV virions. We contemplate that most of host proteins identified are enclosed into the virion particles and may be functionally involved in PRRSV life cycle, pathogenesis and virulence.

Aliquots (3 \u03bcl) of protease treated of PRRS virions were adsorbed on the grid and was thoroughly washed for 5 min in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) placed on parafilm. For detergent treatments, after removing the excess fluid by touching the edge of grids with filter paper, the grids were then covered with 1% alkyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol (Triton X-100) for 2 min. The grids were then washed with distilled water and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 45 min. Blocking reagent was removed, and grids were incubated on a drop of primary antibody solution (diluted 1:100 in BSA/TBS) for 1 h at RT. Following three times thorough wash with TBS, the grids were incubated with the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with gold particles (6 nm in diameter, Abcam) for 1 h at RT. The unbound antibodies were removed, and the grids were thoroughly washed and negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.5) for 30 s. Negatively stained virions were examined on a scan and transmission electron microscope.",
