            "text": "Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enveloped enteropathogenic coronavirus (CoV) with a large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome about 28.5 kb in length. Similar to other CoVs, TGEV has a diameter ranging from 100 to 150 nm, including the surface projections. TGEV infects newborn piglets with mortality rates reaching 100%, resulting in significant losses in the swine industry. The CoV spike protein binds to a cellular receptor and then mediates membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or by endosomal uptake. TGEV, Human coronavirus (HCoV-229E), serotype 2 Feline Coronavirus (FCoV), and Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) all use the aminopeptidase N (APN) protein as the receptor [1]. TGEV infects epithelial cells through the small intestine and the respiratory tract. The virus enters epithelial cells from the apical or basolateral side, and is released from the apical plasma membrane into the gut lumen, where it propagates efficiently by cell-to-cell spreading [2]. Porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) offer a practical model for studying porcine enteric pathogens [3]. However, the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for TGEV entry are largely unknown, and limited informations are available on the cell signaling pathways involved in coronavirus entry via the actin cytoskeleton.",

            "text": "Located beneath the plasma membrane, cortical actin is composed of a loosely organized network of actin cytoskeleton that is highly dynamic and is involved in many cellular processes. Many pathogens facilitate cell entry and/or trafficking by stimulating actin remodeling [4, 5]. Cofilin plays an important role in actin polymerization and depolymerization [6]. LIM-kinases (LIMKs) inhibit the activity of cofilin by phosphorylating the serine residue at position 3 (Ser-3). LIMKs are activated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), p21- activated protein kinases (PAKs), which are downstream kinases of the Rho family GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 [7]. Rho GTPases regulate actin polymerization, induce plasma membrane protrusion and control vesicle trafficking [8]. The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli and regulates a wide range of cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cell growth, cell motility, cell adhesion and vesicular trafficking [9, 10]. The serine/threonine kinase (Akt) is a central node in cell signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli [11]. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play an important role in transforming extracellular intracellular signals and activate PI3K as well as extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 [12]. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the RTK family, and is activated by a family of growth factors including epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1), and the neuregulins. It also interacts with three homologous transmembrane proteins ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 [13, 14]. The binding of EGF to its cell surface receptor activates the receptor's intrinsic tyrosine kinase and phosphorylates the tyrosine at its C-terminus. Phosphorylated EGFR is essential for the activation of Ras GTPase and ERK [15]. EGFR can be activated by many viruses, including influenza A, hepatitis C (HCV), Herpes simplex type 1(HSV-1), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [16-19].",

At 30 mpi, actin stress fibers had became noticeably less abundant in the cytoplasm. At 60 mpi, almost all F-actin was at the cell membrane.

At 60 mpi, TGEV had entered the cytoplasm, we found that F-actin surrounded the TGEV particles in spatial, part of the virus co-localized with the F-actin (yellow) (white arrows). These phenomena were also shown in 3D rendered images.

However, at 60 mpi, p-cofilin appeared to shift from the cytoplasm back to the nucleus (Figure 2A). When the distribution of p-cofilin and F-actin were observed early in infection, we found most p-cofilin did not colocalize with F-actin, and multiple protrusions were noted around the cell membrance (Figure 2B). We knocked cofilin down in normal IPEC-J2 cells, and found that the actin stress fibers were also in the cytoplasm. Usually underneath the cell membrane are the loosely organized network of F-actin filaments that are termed cortical actin [4], but the cortical actin underneath the cell membrane gathered together, the cell surface was smooth and couldn't form protrusions. In cofilin knockdown cells, early in TGEV-infection, some actin stress fibers were also found in the cytoplasm, the protrusions in the cell membrance reduced significantly. The transient increased in p-cofilin level in the cytoplasm from 1 mpi to 30 mpi correlated with the F-actin filaments around the cell membrane and the formation of multiple protrusions. All of these results demonstrate that cofilin involve in the regulation of F-actin early in TGEV infection.",

The expression of WT or constitutively inactivated cofilin S3E significantly increased the expression of p-cofilin (Figure 2E). All three constructs inhibited TGEV entry (Figure 2F). Examination using confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that in uninfected cells, the F-actin partially depolymerized in WT cofilin-expressing cells and in constitutively activated cofilinS3A-expressing cells, while the F-actin in constitutively inactivated cofilinS3E-expressing cells, polymerized around the cell membrane (Figure S2).",

The entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) virions is enhanced by the formation of actin filaments, and actin filaments are recruited to increase the size of the endocytic structure [29]. Early in the infection of TGEV, we observed the rearrangement of cortical actin and the formation of ruffles and protrusions in the cell membrane, as well as EGFR and lipid rafts clustering in the cell membrane, the dissolution of actin stress fibers and their relocalization around the cell plasma membrane. These changes appear to mediate TGEV entry.",

            "text": "Cofilin has a central role in controlling actin dynamics by regulating actin polymerization and depolymerization through its severing activity, as well as by inducing dendritic nucleation [6]. The regulation of cofilin activity is a component of pathogen-mediated actin remodeling [30, 31]. We conclude that phosphorylation of cofilin is critical for TGEV entry. Cofilin can be found in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm [32, 33]. A nuclear localization signal (amino acid residues 30-34) with high homology to the consensus nuclear localization signal sequence of SV40 large T-antigen is found in the cofilin sequence [34]. The nuclear translocation of cofilin is regulated by reversible phosphorylation of Ser-3 [35]. The phosphorylation of cofilin inhibits its F-actin severing activity. We found that p-cofilin was distributed mainly in the nucleus of normal IPEC-J2 cells, however, early after TGEV infection, most p-cofilin was found in the plasma membrane, derived both from the phosphorylation of cofilin and the migration of p-cofilin from the nucleus. Late in infection, a portion of the p-cofilin was dephosphorylated, while the remaining p-cofilin returned to the nucleus. Cofilin supports ARP2/3 complex-mediated actin branching by creating new actin filaments through its F-actin severing activity, making the actin filaments more stable at the cell membrane [36]. Cofilin is required for the early polymerization response to growth factor stimulation and the formation of protrusions, although the ARP2/3 complex is not involved in this process [37, 38]. The inhibition of ARP2/3 caused the actin filaments to bind together more loosely, resulting in increased entry of TGEV. We conclude that the structure of the cortical actin filaments, which underline the cell membrane, plays an important role in TGEV early infection. The regulation of cofilin activity acts as a molecular switch to provide a functional link between actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and the TGEV entry process.",

PI3K/Akt is the main activation pathway for Rac1 in many cell types [40]. Cofilin is inactivated by Rac1 and Cdc42 through PAK and LIMK. The entry of Ebola virions and VSV pseudovirions are decreased when RhoA is overexpressed [41]. RhoA activation by PI3K leads to the formation of stress fibers [4]. Constitutively activated mutant L63RhoA caused the formation of stress fibers, and prevented the destruction of stress fibers caused by TGEV and reduced the amount of F-actin gathered around the cell membrane. The inhibition of ROCK had no effect on the entry of TGEV or the phosphorylation of cofilin.

            "text": "EGFR, a member of the ErbB receptor family, is expressed in many cell types. The primary signaling pathways activated by RTKs include PI3K/Akt, Ras/Raf/ERK1/2, and signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. Our data provides evidence that EGFR acts as a signaling-promoter that is involved in the regulation of actin and TGEV internalization. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection induces filopodia formation and the dissolution of stress fibers by 10 mpi, and HPV entry is also blocked by RTK and PI3K inhibitors [45]. We find that the EGFR specific inhibitor AG1478 and PI3K specific inhibitor Y27632 block stress fiber dissolution, suggesting that the EGFR and PI3K are involved in the signaling pathway that regulates the assembly of F-actin. Our results indicate that EGFR is activated by TGEV binding and promotes TGEV uptake into host cells. It has been reported that a 200-kDa protein in ST cells and in villous enterocytes in newborn pigs may be a second receptor for TGEV and contribute to the age sensitivity of these animals to the virus [46], but the identity of this 200-kDa receptor has not been determined. Although EGFR is a 170-kDa transmembrane protein, we have found that it interacted with TGEV S1 protein, and therefore should be considered as a factor in determining the high level of susceptibility of newborn pigs to TGEV.",

We found that TGEV stimulated the clustering of large lipid rafts, and that activated EGFR, and TGEV virions were associated with the rafts. The clustering of the lipid rafts functions as a signaling platform, but the activation of downstream signaling pathways were inhibited by agents that remove the rafts. The integrity of lipid rafts is essential for the activation of Src kinase and the PI3K/Akt pathway [48]. Based on these data and our results, we hypothesize that TGEV induces the clustering of lipid rafts by the binding of spike protein to APN and EGFR. The activated EGFR then transfers the signal to effector proteins downstream.",
