It is well known that the three otopathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) colonize the nasopharynx from early infancy but bacterial AOM only occurs after viral URI [10\u201312]. Less is known about the colonization of commensals and their dynamics during viral URI. Existing data suggest interference between otopathogens and commensals [13\u201315]. Therefore, enhancement of commensal colonization may interfere with otopathogen colonization leading to disease prevention. Investigators have studied the effect of selected commensal bacteria, e.g. Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, the so-called \u2018probiotic bacteria\u2019, in preventing URI and recurrent AOM, but the results have been mixed [16\u201318]. It is possible that effective probiotic component may require combinations of protective commensals. Refinement of probiotics for prevention of URI and AOM depends on better knowledge and understanding of respiratory tract microbiota and pathogen, commensal, and viral interactions.",

Following sequencing, raw BCL files were retrieved from the MiSeq platform and called into FASTQs by Casava v1.8.3 (Illumina). The read pairs were demultiplexed based on unique molecular barcodes allowing for up to 1 substitution mismatch and reconstituted into two FASTQ files for each. The resulting 250 base long paired end reads were merged together based on the overlapping region.

It is known that infants <6 months are less often diagnosed with AOM compared to older infants. Our data, although from a small number, suggest that one of the factors preventing AOM development in young infants is colonization with Staphylococcus, which helps counteract with the otopathogens. Our previously published report from this cohort [26] has shown the highest S. aureus colonization rate (25%) in samples collected at age 1 month, with declining in rate to 12% by age 6 months, along with increasing rates of colonization of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. Others have also shown the negative association between S. aureus colonization and otopathogen colonization [27\u201329]. Because S. aureus colonization in young infants is not associated with invasive infections [26\u201330], Staphylococcus colonization may be beneficial than harmful to these young infants.

The ideal probiotics should be bacteria that have the most interference (counteracting) with pathogens and cause no harm. Previous studies have used both oral and intranasal probiotics containing alpha streptococci, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium; results have been mixed [16, 34]. We have not found the Lactobacillus genus to be a major nasopharyngeal commensal and we do not have the data on alpha streptococci. Bifidobacterium was commonly found in our samples, ranked 5th among the commensal genera; we did not find it play a role during URI or AOM process. Furthermore, Bifidobacterium was found more commonly in samples from infants with AOM in the first year of life. Our data suggest that intranasal use of Bifidobacterium may not be helpful as a probiotic. Corynebacterium, the most common commensal was found to be significantly lower in samples from infants with AOM in the first year (Table 2), but we observed no other significant difference during the URI or AOM process. Other bacteria that played a reverse role with otopathogens such as Yersinia and Pseudomonas may not be appropriate probiotics for their possible roles as pathogens.",
