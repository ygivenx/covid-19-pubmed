Addition of four or more ubiquitin moieties (polyubiquitination) provides the necessary signal for targeting protein for proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination of target cell surface membrane proteins triggers its internalization and endocytic sorting in addition to proteasomal degradation. For examples, monoubiquitination, the addition of single ubiquitin moieties, of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cytoplasmic tail induces its internalization and transport to the lysosome for degradation [3]\u2013[5] while ubiquitination of membrane receptors \u03b22 adrenergic receptor and interleukin 2 receptor \u03b2 chain is required for their correct internalization and processing [6]\u2013[8].",

Ubiquitination is initiated by the conjugation of two ubiquitin molecules to the E1 activating enzyme. The ubiquitin molecules are then transferred to the E2 conjugating enzyme in an ATP-dependent reaction. E2 enzyme interacts with a specific E3 partner and transfers the ubiquitin molecules to the target protein [9]. The ubiquitinated proteins are subsequently transported to the proteasome where the ubiquitin chains are cleaved off by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) releasing the ubiquitin molecules to reenter the cycle [2].

            "text": "Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) primarily utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway to enter host cells [12], [13]. KSHV is a large enveloped DNA virus that uses cell surface molecules as its receptors, which includes heparan sulfate [14], integrin \u03b13\u03b21 [15], integrin \u03b1\u00d7\u03b23 [16], xCT [17] and DC-SIGN [18], to initiate entry into target cells. The possible role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the internalization of KSHV and its cognate receptor(s) has yet to be examined. In this study, we investigated the role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system during the entry and intracellular trafficking of KSHV and one of its cognate receptors, integrin \u03b21. We detailed the requirements for proteasome function and de novo ubiquitination for efficient viral entry into endothelial cells and intracellular trafficking to the perinuclear regions. Inhibition of proteasome function by several chemicals reduced viral entry and intracellular trafficking, and caused an accumulation of viral particles in an early endosomal compartment. As a result, KSHV infectivity was reduced. Inhibition of proteasome function resulted in an enrichment of ubiquitinated proteins and a depletion of the cellular pool of free ubiquitin. Inhibition of E1 activating enzyme reduced internalization of KSHV as well as its receptor integrin \u03b21. The E3 ligase c-Cbl was activated during KSHV entry. Knock-down of c-Cbl or inhibition of its activation blocked KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking, resulting in reduced viral infectivity, suggesting that this E3 ligase may mediate the internalization, and endosomal transport and sorting of KSHV-containing endosomes. We also report the involvement of the E3 ligase Rabex5, and the endocytic adaptor proteins epsin and eps15, during KSHV entry into endothelial cells. These results suggest that ubiquitination is required for KSHV entry into endothelial cells and during its endosomal sorting and intracellular trafficking.",

            "text": "To investigate the role of proteasome activity during KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were pretreated with chemical inhibitors of the 26S proteasome, MG132 or epoxomicin (EPOX), for 1 hr prior to KSHV infection. MG132 is a peptide aldehyde that potently inhibits the transition state of the proteasome [19]. EPOX selectively and irreversibly binds to the catalytic \u03b2 subunits of the proteasome and effectively inhibits multiple proteolytic activities [20]. At 4 hr post-infection (hpi), the total numbers of viral particles docked at each nucleus or in a whole cell revealed by staining for small capsid protein Orf65 were quantified. Inhibition of proteasome activity with either MG132 or EPOX had no effect on the total numbers of cell-associated viral particles including those that were associated with plasma membrane (Figure S1), indicating that the proteasome inhibitors do not affect the attachment of viral particles to the cells. However, inhibition of proteasome activity with either MG132 (Figure 1A\u2013B) or EPOX (Figure 1C\u2013D) resulted in significantly fewer Orf65+ viral particles docked at the nuclear membranes at a dose-dependent fashion compared to cells treated with DMSO alone. Under these experimental conditions, we did not observe any noticeable cytotoxicity of the inhibitors to the cells based on propidium iodide (PI) staining (data not shown). To determine whether proteasome inhibitors actually blocked the infectious pathway of KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking, we stained the cells for the expression of LANA protein (Orf73) for evidence of successful infection. Inhibition of proteasome function significantly reduced the numbers of LANA-positive cells at 48 hpi (Figure 2A and B). At the highest used doses of MG132 (96 \u00b5g/ml) and EPOX (500 nM), LANA-positive cells were reduced from 96.86% of the untreated cells to 0% and 3.49%, respectively (Figure 2B). These results indicate that proteasome activity is necessary for successful KSHV intracellular trafficking to the nuclei.",

Confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used to acquire Z-stack images. Deconvolved images were analyzed in three-dimensional (3-D) to determine the numbers of viral particles in the extracellular, membrane-bound, cytoplasmic, or nuclear spaces. The spot detection function was used to identify and quantify the number of Orf65+ viral particles in a cell. Surface contours were generated to enable the visualization of cell membranes and nuclei (Figures 3A\u2013C, and Videos S1\u2013S4). There is a modest but statistically significant increase in the numbers of viral particles retained at the plasma membranes following proteasome inhibition (Figure 3D). In addition, a greater proportion of viral particles were retained in the cytoplasm in the proteasome-inhibited cells compared to untreated cells (Figure 3E). As expected, fewer viral particles reached the nuclear membrane (Figure 3F).",

In addition to Orf65+ viral particles, cells were stained for either EEA1 (Figure 4, and Videos S5\u2013S8) or LAMP1 (Figure 5, and Videos S9\u2013S12) to identify the early endosomal compartment or the late endosome/lysosomal compartment, respectively.

Proteasome inhibition resulted in more viral particles colocalized with the early endosome marker, EEA1, in the entire cells (Figure 4B), or viral particles associated with plasma membrane (Figure 4C) and cytoplasm (Figure 4D), compared to untreated controls. In contrast, fewer viral particles were colocalized with LAMP1, the late endosome/lysosome marker, in the entire cells (Figure 5B), or viral particles associated with plasma membrane (Figure 5C) and cytoplasm (Figure 5D), following proteasome inhibition. These results suggest that proteasome function is required for the maturation of virus-containing endosomes from the early to late endosome, and that endosomal maturation is necessary for successful viral trafficking to nuclei.",

Inhibition of proteasome function results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which may reduce the pool of free ubiquitin available for de novo ubiquitination events, implying that ubiquitination of KSHV and/or its receptors could be the mediator of KSHV internalization. To further understand how proteasome inhibition prevents viral entry and intracellular trafficking, we investigated the role of two adaptor molecules that link clathrin-mediated endocytosis and ubiquitination. Epsin and Eps15 are endocytic adaptor proteins that recognize ubiquitinated cargo through their ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) [21], [22]. Binding of Epsin to ubiquitinated EGFR is required for its translocation into clathrin-coated pits [22]. Binding of Eps15 to ubiquitinated Cx43 mediates its internalization through endocytosis [21]. Since KSHV enters HUVEC primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we hypothesized that endocytic adaptor proteins such as Epsin or Eps15 may play an important role during KSHV entry. As shown in Figure 6A, most KSHV particles were colocalized with both Epsin and Eps15 during infection of HUVEC. However, we also observed small numbers of KSHV particles that were not colocalized with the adaptor proteins, possibly reflecting the transient nature of the interaction. The detection of these non-colocalized particles indicates that the observed colocalization is specific but not due to random distribution of the viral particles. These results suggest that KSHV utilizes clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter cells, and either KSHV or its receptor(s) is subjected to ubiquitination during the viral internalization process.",

To test this, we treated endothelial cells with either MG132 or EPOX for 1 hr, before the inoculation with KSHV. Cells were analyzed for ubiquitin by immunoblots at different times post-treatment. Both polyubiquitinated proteins and free ubiquitin were detected in the DMSO-treated samples regardless of KSHV infection (Figure 6B\u2013C). The typical smear of higher molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins was visible in all lysates tested, though there was an obvious increase in the amount of ubiquitination in the samples treated with proteasome inhibitors.

However, UBEI-41 had no detectable effect on the total numbers of viral particles per cell including those that were associated with plasma membrane (Figure S1).

Although it is the first time shown for KSHV infection, the ubiquitin/proteasome system is known to regulate either entry or gene expression of several other viruses, including equine infectious anemia virus [39], influenza virus [40], [41] herpes simplex 1 [42], murine coronavirus [43], and vaccinia virus [44]. We have found that the total numbers of KSHV particles reaching nuclei were significantly reduced upon suppression of proteasome function, suggesting that virus entry and intracellular trafficking was arrested at a step prior to docking at nuclei. Consistent with these results, we found that proteasome inhibitors reduced KSHV infectivity indicating that they indeed affected the KSHV infectious pathway. Three-dimensional analysis of infected cells revealed that inhibition of proteasome activity resulted in a modest increase in viral particles retained at the plasma membrane, and a significant accumulation of viral particles in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, cells treated with proteasome inhibitors had increased numbers of viral particles retained in the EEA1+ early endosomal compartments. Cells treated with proteasome inhibitors had higher numbers of EEA1+ particles at the membrane, and higher numbers of EEA1+ particles in the cytoplasm as compared to cells treated with DMSO. In contrast, proteasome inhibition reduced the total number of KSHV particles in the LAMP1+ late endosome/lysosome compartments. Lower numbers of LAMP1+ particles were observed both in the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions. These results are in agreement with the study conducted with influenza virus, which showed that proteasome activity is required for progress from the early to late endosomes during its entry of cells [40].",

One of the primary functions of proteasome is degradation of proteins, an intracellular event. For viruses that enter cells via endocytosis, the entry process is initiated by the attachment of infectious virions to the cellular receptors at the surface of the cell followed by internalization of viral particles and receptors. How proteasome function affects the internalization and intracellular trafficking of virions from outside the cell to the nuclei is not immediately obvious. However, it is known that internalization of EGFR and other membrane receptors requires the ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail. Following ubiquitination, endocytic adaptor proteins Epsin and Eps15 will recognize the ubiquitinated region of EGFR and facilitate its movement into the clathrin-coated pits. Since KSHV enters cells primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [12], [13], we hypothesized that Epsin and or Eps15 are involved in the entry process. Indeed, 3-D colocalization analysis revealed that both Epsin and Eps15 are associated with KSHV particles, suggesting that either the viral particles or their receptors are ubiquitinated. In addition, when proteasome function is inhibited, the level of free ubiquitin is greatly diminished, which may explain how virus internalization and intracellular trafficking are suppressed in this context.",

KSHV has evolved to use members of the integrin family, mainly integrin \u03b13\u03b21 and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 as its receptors [15], [16]. Integrins are heterodimers composed of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. We observed a high percentage of colocalization of KSHV particles with integrin \u03b21. Integrin \u03b21 is targeted for ubiquitination following inoculation with KSHV, which is prevented by treatment with an inhibitor of the E1 activating enzyme. In addition, live-labeling of cells with antibody against integrin \u03b21 revealed that when ubiquitination is prevented, integrin \u03b21 is retained at the plasma membrane. Finally, entry and intracellular trafficking of KSHV was greatly reduced in endothelial cells treated with the inhibitor of E1 activating enzyme, UBEI-41, in a dose-dependent manner, proving that ubiquitination itself directly mediates viral entry and trafficking. Together these results indicate that inhibition of proteasome function causes an arrest at an early stage of KSHV entry into cells, which is supported by the observations of increased numbers of viral particles at the membrane and cytoplasm, and increased colocalization of viral particles with EEA1. These results suggest that ubiquitination may be required for the initial steps of internalization from the plasma membrane and maturation of the early endosome. In fact, ubiquitination may be required at multiple steps of the entry process, from the formation of the clathrin-coated pits and internalization, to endosomal maturation, and finally docking at the nuclear membrane. Further studies should delineate the possible roles for ubiquitination during post-early endosome stages.",

            "text": "We have examined E3 ligases that may mediate KSHV internalization and maturation of KSHV-containing endosomes. EEA1 is a docking/tethering protein that binds to membranes containing Rab5 GTPase, thus effecting endosomal fusion and maturation [45]\u2013[47]. Rab5 activation effected by GDP to GTP conversion is regulated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Rabex-5. Rabex-5 is autoubiquitinated [48], and is also an E3 ligase with a N-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain that mediates cargo targeting to the early endosomal membrane [31], [49]. The fact that we have observed an accumulation of viral particles in an EEA1+ early endosomal compartment in conditions when ubiquitin is unavailable, as well as colocalization of viral particles with Rabex-5 is intriguing. Although the level of colocalization was minimal (6% of KSHV particles), the infection was unsynchronized, and the assay was performed at a single time point, at 4 hpi. However, we did observe substantial colocalization with the E3 ligase c-Cbl, and more specifically, we observed colocalization with the activated phosphorylated forms of c-Cbl, phospho-Y700 and phospho-Y774. Consistent with these results, knock-down of c-Cbl significantly inhibited viral entry and intracellular trafficking, and prevented KSHV infection of the endothelial cells. Furthermore, when c-Cbl activation was prevented by inhibition of Src, KSHV entry and intracellular trafficking was dramatically reduced. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that Src inhibition did in fact prevent phosphorylation of c-Cbl at tyrosine residues 700 and 774 during KSHV infection. These results are in agreement with a recent study that demonstrated the important role of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation for KSHV entry into human dermal microvascular endothelial cells via the macropinocytic pathway [50]. The same group also investigated the ubiquitination of myosin IIA during KSHV infection, and found that c-Cbl may be mediating the formation of membrane blebs through its E3 ligase activity. However, our results have demonstrated the role of the ubiquitin proteasome system during clathrin-mediated KSHV endocytic entry into endothelial cells. We have independently identified c-Cbl as a mediator of KSHV entry into endothelial cells, confirming its essential roles as both an adaptor molecule and as an E3 ligase in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Nevertheless, it remains possible that ubiquitination and other E3 ligases are involved at later stages of endosomal maturation. Mammalian cells express hundreds of E3 ligases. The functions of most of these other ligases have not been well-studied. The identification of an E3 ligase that specifically mediates ubiquitination leading to viral entry could certainly provide a potential therapeutic target.",

To measure colocalization of endosomal markers with KSHV particles through the x, y, and z planes, the red channel (Orf65) was masked to create a new channel that encapsulates the 500 nm region of the image around the center of each viral particle. The masked channel was then used to determine viral particle colocalization with each of the endosomal markers (EEA1 or LAMP1) as well as for epsin, eps15, Rabex-5, c-Cbl, Y700-c-Cbl, and Y774-c-Cbl. The same procedure was also used to determine colocalization of viral particles with integrin \u03b21 and the plasma membrane labeled with AlexaFluor647 wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in the far-red channel as well as viral particles that were colocalized with nuclei stained with DAPI in the blue channel.
