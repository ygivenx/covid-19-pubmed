In mammals, defensins and cathelicidins are the primary AMPs expressed in professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages [1]. Mammalian defensins comprise three structural subfamilies termed \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b8-defensins. While all defensins are arginine rich, tridisulfide containing peptides, they are distinguished from each other by the presence of unique disulfide motifs [2]. In addition, \u03b8-defensins, which are approximately half the size of \u03b1- and \u03b2-defensins, are macrocyclic molecules which have only been isolated from leukocytes of Old World monkeys (reviewed in [2], [3]). Defensins have antimicrobial activities against diverse microbial targets that include bacteria [4], fungi [5], [6], viruses [7], [8], [9], and protozoa [10]. Certain \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b8-defensins function as regulators of adaptive immune cells and thus function to modulate inflammation [11], [12], [13] and bridge innate and adaptive immunity [14].",

In neutrophils, HNP 1\u20134 are stored in the cytoplasmic azurophil granules which are mobilized during phagocytosis resulting in the exposure of ingested microorganisms to high concentrations of HNPs in the phagolysosomes [2]. In the setting of bacteremic sepsis, HNPs also accumulate in the extracellular compartment [15], [16]. Several studies have demonstrated an extracellular role for myeloid \u03b1-defensins in regulating cellular activities including cell proliferation [17], [18], [19], neovascularization [20], [21], chemotaxis [22], and regulation of cytokines [23], [24] and signal transduction pathways [17], [19], [24], [25].

Neutrophil elastase (NE), an azurophil granule protease, was shown to correctly process RMAD4, a rhesus macaque neutrophil \u03b1-defensin in vitro\n[32]. Bovine and human cathelicidins, a distinct class of antimicrobial peptides, are processed by the azurophil granule proteases, NE [33] and proteinase 3 (PR3) [34] respectively. Studies with HL-60 cells, a human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, show that HNPs are biosynthesized and processed to mature peptides in these cells [35], but the proteases involved in maturation of human myeloid \u03b1-defensins have not been identified. Because HNPs co-localize to neutrophil granules containing the serine proteases NE, PR3 and cathepsin G (CG) [36], we hypothesized that HNP maturation is mediated by one or more of these proteinases. In this study, recombinant proHNP1 was used as substrate to analyze the human \u03b1-defensin convertase activities of NE, PR3, and CG. The requirement for the native HNP1 fold was analyzed by assessing the processing of folded and misfolded preparations of proHNP1. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the resulting HNP-1 peptides was analyzed utilizing Staphylococcus aureus as the test organism.",

The imidazole eluant from the nickel affinity column (Ni-eluant) contained a major band of \u223c12 kDa, consistent with the molecular weight of His6-proHNP1 (theory  = 12647 A.M.U.; Fig. 2A). C18 reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) of the Ni-eluant produced two major peaks (A and B; Fig. 2B). On reducing SDS-tricine PAGE, peaks A and B contained the \u223c12 kDa band (Fig. 2C) and both were detected with anti-His6 antibody confirming the presence of His6-proHNP1 (Fig. 2D). On AU-PAGE, His6-proHNP1 present in peak A (proHNP1A) migrated more rapidly than that contained in peak B (proHNP1B; Fig. 2E), suggesting that proHNP1A and proHNP1B are differently folded forms of the recombinant protein. This was confirmed by the finding that DTT-reduced proHNP1A and proHNP1B co-eluted on RP-HPLC (data not shown) and by demonstrating that folding of proHNP1B in the presence of reduced/oxidized glutathione led to the formation of proHNP1A (Text S1 and Figure S1). Thus, proHNP1A and proHNP1B contain folded and misfolded His6-proHNP1 respectively. ProHNP1A and proHNP1B-containing fractions were pooled separately and purified to homogeneity by a second round of RP-HPLC (Fig. 2F).",

Cleavage of proHNP1A with CNBr, followed by C18 RP-HPLC, gave rise to a major peptide product (Fig. 3A) with a mass (Fig. 3B) and HPLC retention time (Fig. 3C) matching that of natural HNP1. However, CNBr digestion of proHNP1B generated multiple species (Fig. 3A) that had masses consistent with oxidized HNP1 (Fig. 3B), but which eluted later than native HNP1 in RP-HPLC (Fig. 3C). On AU PAGE, HNP1 derived from proHNP1A comigrated with natural HNP1. However, HNP1 derived from proHNP1B migrated more rapidly than the natural standard (Fig. 3D). These data demonstrate that proHNP1A contained folded HNP1 with native disulfide linkages but the mature peptide in proHNP1B, although oxidized, is misfolded and contains non-native disulfide linkages. In solution, HNP1 exists as a non-covalent dimer [37] and the dimeric form corresponds to the single band observed in AU PAGE (Selsted et al., unpublished data). Therefore, it is likely that the higher mobility of proHNP1B-derived HNP1 (Fig. 3D) is due to the monomeric state of this conformer.",

Kamdar et al. demonstrated that NE digestion of proRMAD4, precursor of rhesus myeloid \u03b1-defensin-4 (RMAD4), converted proRMAD4 to mature RMAD4. However, digestion of proRMAD4 with PR3 and CG generated RMAD4 variants with N-terminal extensions (Fig. 5D) [32]. To test for the role of these granule serine proteases in human HNP processing, proHNP1A was incubated in separate reactions with NE, PR3, or CG, and the RP-HPLC-purified cleavage products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and analytical HPLC (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Incubation of His6-proHNP1 with NE or PR3 generated peptide products that co-eluted with native HNP1 in RP-HPLC (34.8 min; Fig. 5A, B) and had monoisotopic masses of 3440.6 and 3441.3 A.M.U. respectively, consistent with the mass of native HNP1 (3439.9 A.M.U. observed; theory = 3439.5 A.M.U.; Table 1). The identities of HNP1 derivatives were also confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS of each peptide following reduction and S-carboxyamidomethylation. In each case reduction and alkylation produced a mass increase of 348 A.M.U., confirming the presence of 6 disulfide-linked cysteine residues (Table 1). The NE- and PR3-derived peptides also co-migrated with native HNP1 on AU-gels (Fig. 5C; lanes 1\u20133). Thus, NE and PR3 processing of His6-proHNP1 generated a peptide that was indistinguishable from natural HNP1.",

To test this, we produced proHNP1 without the N-terminal tag by incubating proHNP1A with enterokinase, thereby releasing the 41-residue tag sequence. This peptide was then treated with NE, PR3, or CG which liberated peptides with monoisotopic masses of 3439.7, 3439.7 and 3684.5 A.M.U., respectively, products equivalent to those generated from His6- proHNP1A.

The expression of folded and misfolded forms of proHNP1 allowed for the analysis of the structural requirements for HNP1-mediated bactericidal activity in vitro. CNBr treatment of folded (proHNP1A) or misfolded (proHNP1B) precursor generated different HNP1 conformers (Fig. 3).

While proHNPs were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic/microsomal fraction, the granule fraction contained only the intermediate and mature HNP [35]. Therefore it is likely that proHNP-processing by NE and PR3 occurs during the packaging of HNPs in azurophil granules. CG processing of proHNP1A produced a peptide that was extended at the amino terminus by two residues (Asn-Met) expressed at the carboxyl terminus of the HNP1 prosegment. Harwig et al. identified a minor form of HNP3 in fully differentiated neutrophils with the same Asn-Met dipeptide extension [41] reported here.

Since MMP7 is not present in neutrophils, it was proposed that MMP7 may be involved in the extracellular processing of proHNP1 released from the specific granules of neutrophils. In this regard, Borregaard and co-workers showed that proHNP1 is present in the specific granules of mature human neutrophils and that the propeptide is secreted by activated cells [43]. Since enzymatically active NE is present in inflammatory exudates [44], we hypothesize that proHNP1, elaborated by activated PMNs, may be activated by NE (and possibly other enzymes such as PR3 and CG) in the extracellular milieu. Therefore this process may regulate the extracellular expression of mature \u03b1-defensin in the setting of inflammation.",
