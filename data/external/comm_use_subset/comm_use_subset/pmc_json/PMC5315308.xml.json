            "text": "Bronchiolitis is the most common acute lower respiratory tract infection of viral origin among infants [1]. It is characterized by cough, rhinorrhea, crackles, wheezes, fever, and hypoxemia [2\u20134]. Common etiology includes respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, or parainfluenza [5, 6]. The economic and social implications of bronchiolitis are substantial. In North America, hospitalizations attributable to bronchiolitis have increased twofold over the past two decades [7, 8]. The disease currently accounts for more than 100 thousand hospital admissions annually at an estimated cost of $1.73 billion [9]. In the United Kingdom, 1 in 3 infants will develop bronchiolitis in the first year of life and 2 to 3% of all infants require hospital admissions. In England alone, there were 30,451 secondary care admissions for bronchiolitis between 2011 and 2012 [10].",

Common pharmacological agents such as bronchodilator, corticosteroid, and hypertonic saline have been shown to only provide symptomatic relief [11]. Maintaining hydration and oxygenation of patient remains the cornerstone of management [12]. In the absence of efficacious curative therapy, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in bronchiolitis is gaining popularity [13].",

The studies were published between 1997 and 2015 in English (n = 9) [17\u201321, 28\u201330, 32] and Chinese (n = 2) [31, 33] language.

In all studies, bronchiolitis was diagnosed by a physician based on symptoms of acute wheezing or respiratory distress. In seven studies, the infants were diagnosed as first time wheezers [17\u201319, 21, 28\u201330]. Another one study recruited a combination of wheezing and non-wheezing patients [20].

Outcomes reported in the primary studies were not ascertained according to the disease severity, which may have impacted the effectiveness outcomes. The study by Deng et al. also compared Chinese herbal medicine with third generation cephalosporins, aminophylline, oxygen, digitalis, or frusemide [33], suggesting the presence of secondary bacterial infection. However, we did not find any evidence of signs and diagnosis of bacterial infection in the article. Furthermore, a large proportion of the included studies (n = 5, 45%) did not report for the primary outcome of interest in this systematic review, albeit they are all inpatient studies.

The inclusion of only published articles in this review may overestimate the potential benefit of CAM interventions, and thus we urge caution in its interpretation. Another limitation was that the review did not search for grey literature, including conference abstracts, contact with experts and trials registries. As such, we may have missed some studies. In relation to this limitation, we recommend a judicious interpretation of the evidence synthesized in this review as there may be unpublished studies with negative results that we did not include, and thus overestimating the effectiveness of CAM interventions based on the studies that were identified and included. In view of the sparsity of evidence in this area, we recommend that negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available so that the literature can provide evidence base for clinical decision-making.
