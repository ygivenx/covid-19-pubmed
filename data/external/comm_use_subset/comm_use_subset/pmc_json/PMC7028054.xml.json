From the early 1960s, almost 400 fish cell lines have been established (Fryer and Lannan, 1994; Lakra et al., 2011), and used for the investigation of aquatic diseases as well as for environmental monitoring (B\u00e9jar et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2005; Bryson et al., 2006; Sahul\u2010Hameed et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The European eel Anguilla anguilla (L. 1758) is a fish species that has been traditionally used as a main food\u2010consumption product in Europe (Dekker, 2018). A. anguilla was first introduced into China in 1993. In the late 1990s\u2019 and in the first decade of the present century, A. anguilla became the most productive aquacultured Anguillidae species in China. The failed artificial breeding of eels rendered the whole eel industry capture\u2010based, relying on the capture of wild juvenile glass eels (Politis et al., 2017). In the last 50 years, the abundance of A. anguilla in its original habitat has decreased over 90% (Dekker, 2004, 2018), In 2009, A. anguilla was listed CR (critically endangered) by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the precious species is still threatened by various pathogens and pollutants (Yue et al., 1998; Zhang and Gui, 2007; Jakob et al., 2009; Hendriks et al., 2010; Galinier et al., 2012; Ge et al., 2012; van Beurden et al., 2012; Fichtner et al., 2013). The disease prevention and protection of A. anguilla requires additional viable in vitro cell line tools. To date, the Anguillidae invitrome remains considerably limited (Table 1) (Bols et al., 2017). Several cell lines have been derived from Anguilla japonica (Temminck and Schlegel 1846) in the last century (Chen and Kou, 1981; Chen et al., 1982; Kou et al., 1995), while only two cell lines were reported to originate from Anguilla rostrata (Lesueur 1817) (Dewitte\u2010Orr et al., 2006; Bloch et al., 2016) in recent years. However, a limited number of cell lines have been developed from A. anguilla. Our lab attempted for the first time the in vitro tissue and cell culture of multiple European eel organs in 2007 (Zheng, 2008) and the first viscera cell line of A. anguilla has been established (Chen et al., 2019).",

In the present study, we developed and characterized a new cell line from the A. anguilla liver, which presented a significant longevity and proved to be susceptible to Rana grylio virus (RGV) and Herpesvirus anguillae (HVA).

A confluent monolayer appeared at the fifth subculture, and the interval of the first subcultures varied from 30 to 40 days. The subcultures initially consisted of almost the same number of fibroblast\u2010like and epithelial\u2010like cells, as well as a limited number of stellate\u2010like cells. However, only fibroblast\u2010like cells were left after 10 subcultures. The multiplication interval was gradually reduced, following continuous subculture.

From its initiation, this cell line was kept in in vitro culture over 72 months continuously, and was subcultured for more than 90 times. The 60th subculture of EL cells recovered from liquid nitrogen storage and could grow into a confluent culture in 2 days. The average viability of these cells was estimated from 75% to 85%.",

The cells indicated prolonged multiplication intervals on more than 50 passages compared with those noted in other reported marine fish cell lines (Fryer and Lannan, 1994; Lakra et al., 2011). These findings could be attributed to the origin of the experimental animals used. As a European\u2010origin catadromous teleost (Schmidt, 1923), the artificial reproduction of A. anguilla is a difficult task. Since the wild\u2010type embryo and the neonatal leptocephalus are mainly present in the oceans, the glass eels are the predominant catches collected in the European coastal waters. However, their export was restricted after being considered endangered species in 2009. Therefore, the elvers are the youngest eel to be collected from the fish farmers in China. The 20 g elvers had been shown to be at their growth peak in the ponds (Huang and Cheng, 1997) and their tissues and cells were already highly differentiated. Furthermore, the several types of parasites discovered in eel viscera and muscles may also negatively affect the growth potential of early in vitro cultures.",

Their behavior modes can also be altered (Hughes et al., 2007). Two massive cell deaths were noted at the 3rd, 48th, 49th, and 50th subculture, which suggested the optimal time periods for the intrinsic in vitro transformation of the EL cell line (Doyle and Griffiths, 2000). Long\u2010term subculture could also place selective pressure on cell proliferation, which may explain the disappearance of the epithelial\u2010like and stellate\u2010like cells during subcultivation.",

A surprising feature noted in certain species was the inability of hepatocytes to attach and spread using growth\u2010related substrates, which suggested that hepatic cell lines could release attachment and spreading factors that promote the preparation of primary hepatocyte cultures (Bols and Lee, 1991). Similar phenomena were also observed during the early development of the EL cell line. The cell line required considerably higher inoculum density during adherence to a glabrous inner surface of the culture flask, while cells with lower density remained at the bottom and could grow into a confluent monolayer following removal of the supernatant. Therefore, the asymmetrical subculture method was selected.",

However, the mechanism of inflammatory\u2010induced immune modulation remains ambiguous. Recently, cell lines have been used as tools for functional analysis of fish innate immunity genes. The IRF family members play critical roles in the cellular differentiation of hematopoietic cells, in the regulation of gene expression in response to pathogen\u2010derived danger signals, and consequently in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (Tamura et al., 2008). Irf3 and irf7 are highly expressed in the teleost liver (Yao et al., 2012). Irf3 has been reported to be upregulated in both peripheral blood leukocytes and in vivo models following poly (I:C) or LPS stimulation in A. anguilla. This was confirmed in the present study, by the alterations of the irf7 levels following LPS induction. It is interesting to note that the expression levels of irf7 were downregulated in response to poly (I:C) in the present study, compared with a previous in vivo study (Huang et al., 2014). This may be due to the absence of some protein members that participate in multiple cross\u2010talk in vivo signaling pathways.",

In the present study, the expression levels of CYP450 indicated a significant long\u2010term upregulation following poly (I:C) and/or LPS exposure, indicating that the EL cell line could retain the intrinsic characteristics of its hepatic origin.
