The\nincidence object is obtained by running the function\nincidence() specifying two inputs: a vector of dates (representing onset of individual cases) and an interval specification. The dates can be any type of input representing dates including\nDate and\nPOSIXct objects, as well as numeric and integer values. The dates are aggregated into counts based on the user-defined interval representing the number of days for each bin. The interval can also be defined as a text string of either \"week\", \"month\", \"quarter\", or \"year\" to represent intervals that can not be defined by a fixed number of days. For these higher-level intervals, an extra parameter\u2014\nstandard\u2014is available to specify if the interval should start at the standard beginning of the interval (e.g. weeks start on Monday and months start at the first of the month).\nincidence() also accepts a\ngroups argument which can be used to obtain stratified incidence.

Therefore, we fit two log-linear regression models around the peak to characterize the epidemic dynamics of ZVD in Colombia. Such models can be separately fitted to the two phases of the epicurve of\ni.pooled using the\nfit() function, which, however, requires us to know what date should be used to split the epicurve in two phases (see the argument\nsplit in the\nfit() function). Without any knowledge on the splitting date, we can turn to the\nfit_optim_split() function to look for the optimal splitting date (i.e. the one maximizing the average fit of both models) and then fit two log-linear regression models before and after the optimal splitting date.",
