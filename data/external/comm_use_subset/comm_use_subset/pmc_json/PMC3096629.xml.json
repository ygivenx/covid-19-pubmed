In seasonal influenza strains, the majority of H3N2 viruses and a great proportion of H1N1 viruses in humans are now considered to be amantadine- and rimantadine-resistant [10]\u2013[13]. Moreover, a drastic increase in oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses has been reported during the 2007/2008 influenza season in the northern hemisphere [14]\u2013[17]. Preliminary data from the United States predict a further rise for the 2008/2009 season, possibly resulting in more than 90% of the circulating H1N1 strains to be oseltamivir resistant [14].",

Moreover, parenteral agents for the treatment of seriously ill patients are missing. Glycyrrhizin, a triterpene saponine, is a constituent of licorice root. It has been found to interfere with replication and/or cytopathogenic effect (CPE) induction of many viruses including respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, SARS coronavirus, HIV, and influenza viruses [22]\u2013[28]. Moreover, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties were attributed to glycyrrhizin [26]. The severity of human H5N1 disease has been associated with hypercytokinaemia (\u201ccytokine storm\u201d) [29], [30]. Delayed antiviral plus immunomodulator treatment reduced H5N1-induced mortality in mice [31]. Therefore, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects exerted by glycyrrhizin may be beneficial for treatment of H5N1. Also, glycyrrhizin is a known antioxidant [26] and antioxidants were already shown to interfere with influenza A virus replication and virus-induced pro-inflammatory responses [32]\u2013[34].",

Therefore, the glycyrrhizin concentrations found to interfere with H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in the present report are in the range of therapeutic plasma levels. Notably, although higher glycyrrhizin concentrations were needed to interfere with SARS coronavirus replication [22] than with H5N1 replication, beneficial results were reported in glycyrrhizin (SNMC)-treated SARS patients in comparison to SARS patients who did not receive glycyrrhizin [23]. Notably, investigation of different glycyrrhizin derivatives against SARS coronavirus led to the identification of compounds with enhanced antiviral activity [53]. Therefore, glycyrrhizin might also serve as lead structure for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs.",

The mechanism was suggested to be induction of interferon-\u03b3 in T-cells by glycyrrhizin [54]. Moreover, glycyrrhizin was shown to influence seasonal influenza A virus replication through interaction with the cell membrane [25], [28]. However, these effects were observed only in concentrations \u2265200 \u00b5g/ml when glycyrrhizin was added during the virus adsorption period.

Here, glycyrrhizin interfered with H5N1-induced activation of NF\u03baB, p38, and JNK representing redox-sensitive signalling events [48]\u2013[51] involved in influenza A virus replication and influenza A virus-induced cellular cytokine/chemokine production [34], [43]\u2013[46], [55]. Glycyrrhizin 50 \u00b5g/ml significantly reduced H5N1-induced activation of NF\u03baB. In addition, glycyrrhizin concentrations as low as 25 \u00b5g/ml effectively interfered with H5N1-induced ROS formation and with phosphorylation of the redox-sensitive MAPKs p38 and JNK. In our model, activation of p38 appears to be critical for H5N1-associated redox signalling since p38 inhibition had been shown before to mimick effects of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) [34]. Interestingly and in contrast to glycyrrhizin, NAC failed to inhibit H5N1 replication or H5N1-induced cytokine/chemokine expression in therapeutically relevant concentrations.",

Therefore, H5N1-induced proinflammatory gene expression appears to be more sensitive to inhibition of ROS formation than H5N1 replication. Indeed, influenza viruses had been shown to induce cellular pathways through replication-dependent and \u2013independent events [56]. In a previous report, we could show that similar glycyrrhizin concentrations like those investigated here interfered with H5N1-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression but not with H5N1 replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages [57]. In addition, other immunomodulatory treatment regimens that did not influence H5N1 replication reduced mortality in H5N1-infected mice [31], [58]. Therefore, glycyrrhizin represents a potential additional treatment option that interfers with both H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung cells.",

Since we used the clinical formulation SNMC effects of other ingredients like glycin or cystein cannot be excluded. Vaccines and antiviral agents will fail to meet global needs at least at the beginning of a severe influenza A virus pandemic [61]. Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents are considered to be important candidates as constituents of anti-influenza treatment strategies that may save lives in an influenza pandemic situation [61]. Therefore, glycyrrhizin may complement the arsenal of potential drugs for the treatment of H5N1-caused disease.",
