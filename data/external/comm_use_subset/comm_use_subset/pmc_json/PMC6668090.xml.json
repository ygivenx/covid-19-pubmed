Antigenic shift results from the reassortment of genomic segments from different strains of influenza A viruses, often from different host species. The unique antigenicity of these newly emerging reassortant strains can evade existing herd immunity against circulating seasonal influenza A viruses, and this type of punctuated antigenic variation has contributed to influenza pandemics throughout history. As a pandemic influenza strain becomes the most prevalent influenza virus in the population, it contributes its unique genetic characteristics to the gene pool of subsequent seasonal influenza viruses.",

Despite its temporal association with swine A/H1N1 [1], the pdmH1N1 genome contains multiple reassortant viral genes derived from avian influenza viruses [2]. The PB2 and PA genomic segments of pdmH1N1 originated from an avian influenza virus that had previously reassorted into a swine influenza virus in 1998 [3]. The PB1 genomic segment of pdmH1N1 was recently acquired from a human seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus, which had previously acquired PB1 from an avian influenza virus in 1968 [4]. The hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), and nonstructural (NS) genomic segments of pdmH1N1 are from a North American swine influenza virus lineage that can be traced to the pandemic 1918 A/H1N1 virus [5], and the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genomic segments are from a Eurasian swine virus that previously acquired both segments from an avian influenza virus in 1979 [6, 7]. The overall influence of the emergence of pdmH1N1 on the gene pool of currently circulating seasonal human influenza viruses remains largely unclear.",

            "text": "Like most RNA viruses, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of influenza viruses has a higher error rate than that of DNA polymerases because it lacks a proofreading mechanism [8\u201310]. Nucleotide misincorporation by RdRp during replication contributes to antigenic drift, which increases the probability of the virus evading host immunity against seasonal influenza viruses. According to the quasispecies theory, the inherent infidelity of RdRp drives the formation of variant clouds in the influenza virus population that consist of diverse genetic variants which are linked through shared mutations. These variants collectively contribute their antigenic characteristics to the influenza virus population, and interact cooperatively at the functional level as selective pressure acts upon the population as a whole [11]. Mutant clouds provide dynamic repositories of variants permitting certain viruses to undergo adaptation to selective pressures, including species barriers, host immune responses, and antiviral agents. An increased mutation rate allows RNA viruses more opportunities to adjust to environmental stresses, whereas elevated RNA replicase fidelity, despite allowing a virus to stably pass on its genetic traits to its progeny, actually serves to restrict genetic diversity among the viruses that occupy the greatest space in the fitness landscape.",

Variant viruses of each exhibited a certain degree of attenuation or fitness loss in vivo, which was likely the result of restricting genetic diversity at the cost of increasing fidelity. Site-directed mutagenesis of predicted key residues in the RdRp of Coxsackie virus B3 [16] and the exoribonuclease of coronavirus [17, 18] produced some variants with mutator phenotypes that were less virulent in vivo than the wild-type parent viruses. Altering the fidelity of RdRp clearly affects the virulence and fitness of RNA viruses in vivo, demonstrating the critical role that RdRp plays in balancing pathogenesis with adaptation.",

PB1\u2013216 and PB1\u2013336 were thus considered to be the host species-associated amino acid positions in influenza A/H1N1 viruses, and that PB1\u2013216G is the human-associated residue, whereas PB1\u2013336I is associated with infections in both swine and humans. At that time, the biological significance of how antigenic variation at PB1 enabled viruses to switch host species was poorly understood.

All recombinant viruses were generated in vitro by using reverse genetic methods, as previously described [20\u201322]. The HEK293T cells were transfected using the Polyjet DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen, Rockville, MD, USA). The cells were cotransfected with eight pHW2000-based plasmids (1 mg/plasmid), each of which contained one of the eight genomic segments of influenza A virus. Viral genes were expressed under the control of the dual promoters on pHW2000. The inoculums were removed 6 h post-transfection, and replaced with serum free DMEM/HG medium containing 0.1% trypsin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Between 72 and 120 h post-transfection, the culture supernatants were collected for virus recovery. Recombinant viruses were amplified in MDCK cells for 1 to 3 passages before virus titer determination by plaque assay. Single-nucleotide mutations were introduced into the PB1 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis, as previously described [23]. The full-length sequences of the eight viral genomic segments were obtained by conventional DNA sequencing.

In fact, this pandemic 2009 virus strain had subsequently become a human seasonal influenza A/H1N1 strain currently circulating worldwide. We were interested in monitoring the characteristic change in amino acids that may be attributed to the emergence of pandemic 2009 virus and its current offspring of human seasonal A/H1N1. From our previous study, PB1\u2013216 was one of the species-associated positions identified for its exclusively human-like residue Gly found in all pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses and yet, before this pandemic episode, most human influenza A/H1N1 deposited were an avian signature Ser at PB1\u2013216 as their coexisting avian A/H1N1 influenza viruses [19]. In contrast, regardless of pandemic impact, we observed PB1\u2013336 of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus still remained human-like residue Ile while avian influenza H1N1 were almost an avian-associated Val [19]. This observation implies there may be a major transitioning pattern from avian to human occurred amongst different influenza A virus populations during pandemic 2009 outbreak. To further understand the significance of the point mutations PB1-S216G and PB1-V336I in pdmH1N1, we first investigated the chronological changes at these nucleotide positions between A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses collected from different hosts of avian, swine, and human deposited in the Influenza Virus Database. We found that most of the avian A/H1N1 viruses contained PB1\u2013216S and PB1\u2013336 V both before and after 2009 (Fig. 1a). Most of the human A/H1N1 viruses also contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at PB1\u2013216 before 2009. However, with the emergence of pdmH1N1 in 2009, most of the human A/H1N1 viruses primarily had PB1\u2013216G likely via genome reassortment, which thereafter remained the most prevalent residue glycine at that position. By contrast, most human A/H1N1 viruses contained the mammalian-associated residue, isoleucine, at PB1\u2013336 both before and after 2009. Swine A/H1N1 viruses exhibited frequent substitutions between the avian- and mammalian-associated residues at both PB1\u2013216 and PB1\u2013336, reflecting the susceptibility of swine to both avian and human influenza viruses and humans on the other hand can be also infected by swine influenza viruses.",

Indeed, PB1\u2013216G was most prevalent among human A/H3N2 viruses long before 2009. Given that the PB1 genomic segment of pdmH1N1 virus was recently acquired from a human seasonal A/H3N2 virus [3], we examined sequences deposited before 2006 to determine whether an avian to mammalian substitution had previously occurred in human A/H3N2 viruses. We found that the PB1-S216G point mutation indeed occurred in 1993, after which PB1\u2013216G remained the most prevalent signature in PB1 in human A/H3N2 viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S1). These observations suggested that the substitution from the avian-associated residue, serine, to the human-associated residue, glycine, at PB1\u2013216 at the onset of the 2009 pandemic was the result of robust evolutionary adaptation that has impacted currently circulating seasonal human A/H1N1 viruses worldwide.",

TW126 PB1 contains the typical human signatures of Gly at PB1\u2013216 and Ile at PB1\u2013336; in contrast, the laboratory reference strain, PR8, exhibits avian signatures at the corresponding positions of PB1. To examine whether this difference in pathogenicity in mice was associated with the avian and mammalian signatures in the PB1 sequences of TW126 and PR8, we first used a reverse genetic to recover PR8/TW126PB1, a reassortant PR8 virus containing the whole PB1 genomic segment of TW126. We also generated the PR8/TW126PB1(G216S) variant by PB1-G216S point mutation in PR8/TW126PB1.

To further investigate the role of PB1\u2013216S in virulence in mice, we used PR8 virus to generate the PR8PB1(S216G) and PR8PB1(I563R) variants. We used the PR8PB1(I563R) variant as a control for our experiments because the I563R mutation in PB1 was not expected to affect polymerase activity or fidelity. Growth curves of PR8PB1(S216G) in MDCK cells were similar to those of PR8, PR8/TW126PB1, PR8/TW126PB1(G216S), and PR8PB1(I563R) (p > 0.05 for all; Fig. 2a).

These results indicated that avian-associated PB1\u2013216S is a major virulence determinant for influenza A/H1N1 viruses in mice. By the lethal challenge test in mice, the biological significance could be readily observed because of the difference between PB1\u2013216S and PB1\u2013216G containing viruses (Fig. 2c); influenza A viruses with PB1\u2013216S appeared to be more virulent than virus with PB1\u2013216G.",

Because RdRp fidelity has been associated with the virulence of influenza A viruses in mice [31], we investigated whether the PB1-S216G point mutation affects mutation frequency of PR8 and PR8PB1(S216G). We constructed an artificial influenza genomic segment containing the dual luciferase RNA reporter gene [32], RT2AF, which contained the open reading frames for Firefly and Renilla luciferases connected in tandem by a UAA stop codon (Fig. 3a). Replication capability was determined based on Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activity. The ratio of the activities of Firefly luciferase (Fluc) and Rluc was used to quantify RdRp fidelity based on the frequency of stop codon repair during viral replication and transcription of RT2AF, which was expressed as the cumulative mutation index (CMI), whereby CMI = Fluc/Rluc (Additional file 1: Figure S2). In influenza-virus-infected HEK293 cells transfected with RT2AF, we found that, while virus replication levels were similar between PR8, PR8PB1(S216G) and PR8PB1(I563R) (Fig. 3b), the PR8PB1(S216G) variant exhibited a significantly higher CMI as compared with PR8 and PR8PB1(I563R) (p = 0.0014 and p = 0.0059, respectively; Fig. 3c).",

Using such minireplicon assay system, we in Fig. 3d and e compared the replication capability and mutation potential between pairs of PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/PR8 (PB1\u2013216S) and PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/PR8 (PB1-S216G), PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1\u2013216G) and PR8 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-G216S), as well as TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1\u2013216G) and TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-G216S), respectively. The replication capability of RdRp by measuring Rluc activity were not significantly different (Fig. 3d), indicating that swapping between Gly and Ser at PB1\u2013216 did not affect RdRp replication levels. However, the mutation potential of RdRp determined by CMI (Fig. 3e) showed that RdRp complex having PB1\u2013216G derived from different viruses could all exhibit significantly higher mutation capability than PB1\u2013216S; especially for the experimental groups of TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1\u2013216G) and TW126 (PB2 + PA + NP)/TW126 (PB1-G216S), from which all four polymerase subunits of PB2, PB1, PA and NP proteins could be closely interactive during viral replication as they were in the native background of TW126 virus, a clinical isolate of pdmH1N1 from Taiwan. In this study, the results from Fig. 3 were further confirmed by using a previously described conventional assay for determining RdRp nucleotide incorporation fidelity and clonal sequencing [31] that had compared the frequency of mutations in HA of PR8 with that of PR8PB1(S216G). As these results shown in Table 1, the mutation frequency of PR8PB1(S216G) was significantly greater than that of PR8 (p = 0.025). The combined results of our experiments indicated that the PB1\u2013216G mammalian signature in influenza A/H1N1 viruses confers lower RdRp fidelity than the PB1\u2013216S avian signature, and thereby increases the frequency of mutations during viral replication.",

In a previous study a mutant variant of poliovirus that exhibited enhanced RdRp fidelity was more resistant to ribavirin treatment than wild-type poliovirus with low RdRp fidelity [12], likely because such a faithful RdRp generated less mutations during viral replication. Similar observations were also reported for HIV studies [34, 35], in which the high fidelity of reverse transcriptase could reduce the lethal toxicity of nucleoside analogue 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-3\u2032-thiacytidine (3TC) by making less mutations during retroviral replication. In this study, to examine the effect of the PB1-S216G point mutation on resistance to ribavirin treatment, we compared the replication of PR8 and PR8PB1(S216G) viruses in RT2AF-transfected HEK293 cells in the presence of various concentrations of ribavirin. We found that the ribavirin-mediated inhibition of PR8PB1(S216G) replication was significantly greater than that of PR8 especially at 1 and 2 \u03bcM ribavirin (Fig. 4). This result indicated that the PB1-S216G point mutation of influenza A virus could not only reduce RdRp fidelity but also increase sensitivity to ribavirin during replication, consistent with the results from the previous reports concerning poliovirus and HIV [12, 34, 35].",

In a previous study of poliovirus variants, increased fidelity resulted in a less diversified population and reduced adaptation under adverse growth conditions [11, 12]. The V43I mutation in influenza PB1 is associated with high-fidelity RdRp [31]. Our analysis of influenza A virus sequences showed that PB1\u201343I did not appear in human influenza A viruses, and occurred only rarely in avian H5N1, swine H3N2, and swine H1N1 viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S3), thereby excluding it as a factor in the displacement of PB1\u2013216S viruses by PB1\u2013216G viruses.",

Previous studies of influenza A/H1N1viruses have reported NA mutations, including NA-H274Y/H275Y and NA-N294S, that contributed to oseltamivir resistance [26, 36\u201338]. To gain insight into how low-fidelity PB1\u2013216G variants replaced PB1\u2013216S after the emergence of pdmH1N1, we examined the incidence of mutations that conferred oseltamivir resistance from 2006 to 2017. We found that the incidence of oseltamivir resistance in 2006 and 2007 was much lower than that in 2008, after which an NA-H275Y point mutation coincided with a steep rise in the incidence of oseltamivir resistant mutations worldwide (Additional file 1: Table S1). In mid-2009, the oseltamivir-sensitive pdmH1N1 virus (PB1\u2013216G/NA-275H) emerged (Fig. 1a), the number of oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y viruses decreased rapidly. Thus, the rapid displacement of NA-275Y by NA-275H coincided with the displacement of the avian 216S signature by the mammalian 216G signature in the field.",

This pattern in oseltamivir resistance was confirmed in the whole genome analysis, which showed that most NA-275H/PB1\u2013216G viruses were oseltamivir sensitive, and oseltamivir resistant NA-275Y/PB1\u2013216S viruses contained at least one of these five NA mutations (Table 2). We then examined the incidence of the permissive secondary mutations, NA-V241I and NA-N369K, which have been shown to that improve fitness in NA-275Y viruses [39]. The incidence of NA-241I and NA-369 K decreased during the first half of 2009; however, the number of viruses with NA-241I or NA-369Ks increased after 2009, and became predominant by 2011 (Additional file 1: Table S1).",

As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S4a, PR8 and PR8PB1(S216G) infected MDCK cells were serial passaged with successive incubation in progressively higher concentrations of oseltamivir, reaching a maximum concentration of 625 nM oseltamivir at passage 5 and thereafter. The NA gene sequence was determined after each passage by conventional Sanger sequencing of viral cDNA, which allowed the identification of mutations in a single, relatively long read without the assembly and annotation of shotgun sequencing data obtained using high-throughput methods [36]. The NAN294S mutation was first detected in PR8PB1(S216G) at passage 7, and serine was the most prevalent residue at NA-294 at passage 9 and thereafter (Additional file 1: Figure S4b, right). No other mutations were detected in the NA gene of PR8PB1(S216G). The NAH274Y mutation was first detected at passage 11 in PR8 that had PB1\u2013216S, and tyrosine became the most prevalent residue at NA-274 at passage 14 (Additional file 1: Figure S4b, left). These results illustrate that PB1-S216G in A/H1N1 viruses could acquire adaptive mutations in NA conferring oseltamivir resistance at a higher frequency than viruses with PB1-G216S in A/H1N1 viruses. Nevertheless, it remains unclear as how two different NA mutations could have independently emerged from PR8 or PR8PB1(S216G) under selection pressure.",

Ribavirin-resistant viruses typically contained mutations within the RdRp gene causing elevated-fidelity phenotypes that exhibited lower fitness and/or lower virulence in infected animals, compared with the parental viruses. Among these high-fidelity RdRp mutations in ribavirin-resistant variants, the PB1V43I variant of influenza A/H5N1 exhibited reduced virus population diversity, attenuated virulence, and low neurotropism in mice [31]. By contrast, the mutation of key residues in the RdRp of Coxsackievirus B3 [16] and the exoribonuclease of coronaviruses [17, 18] generated virus variants exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies and attenuated virulence in mice.",

Our data show that the avian-to-mammalian signature substitution (serine-to-glycine) at PB1\u2013216 in pdmH1N1 is highly suggestive of avian/swine to human influenza virus transmission contributing to the influenza outbreak that caused the 2009 pandemic [19, 42].

Although these differences in mutation frequency are relatively small, the effects of the PB1-S216G point mutation in PR8PB1(S216G) on replication and adaptation, compared to that of PR8, were readily apparent in the results of the ribavirin inhibition assay (Fig. 4) and in vitro NAI assay (Additional file 1: Figure S4).

In contrast to the current exclusively predominance of PB1\u2013216G in human A/H1N1 viruses, our analysis of influenza A virus sequences deposited in GenBank (Fig. 1; Additional file 1: Figure S3) showed that PB1\u2013216S remained predominant in avian influenza A/H1N1 viruses. We also found that, while the PB1\u201343I mutation associated with high-fidelity RdRp [31] occurred rarely in avian H5N1 and swine H3N2 as well as swine H1N1 viruses, it was not found in human influenza A viruses. These results indicated that, although the high-fidelity PB1\u201343I influenza A variant can be obtained by reverse genetics and occurs sporadically in the field, it confers no significant evolutionary advantage relative to PB1\u201343 V viruses.",

We found that the incidences of oseltamivir resistance in human influenza A/H1N1 viruses in 2006 and 2007 were much lower than that in 2008, at which time the emergence of oseltamivir resistant variants rose steeply worldwide due to an NA-H275Y point mutation. The frequency of NA-275Y peaked in the first quarter of 2009, with nearly all NA deposits containing the mutation (Additional file 1: Table S1). However, during the mid-2009, the oseltamivir-sensitive pdmH1N1 virus emerged, which contained NA-275H, and pdmH1N1 rapidly displaced oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y viruses afterwards. The proportion of oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y A/H1N1 viruses with avian-associated PB1\u2013216S increased rapidly to predominance in the human influenza A/H1N1 population in the first half of 2009, and were subsequently replaced with oseltamivir-sensitive pdmH1N1 at an equally rapid rate (Additional file 1: Table S1). Nonetheless, this change in oseltamivir sensitivity at the population level coincided closely with the rising prevalence of mammalian-associated low-fidelity PB1\u2013216G in influenza A/H1N1 viruses near the onset of the 2009 influenza pandemic (Fig. 1; Table 2). One appealing hypothesis is that the higher-fidelity RdRp (PB1\u2013216S) of the oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y A/H1N1 viruses resulted in higher replication rate in the absence oseltamivir selective pressure, thereby rapidly increasing the proportion of these viruses in the population during the swine influenza pandemic in the first quarter of 2009. This rapid rise to predominance was followed by the development of a certain unidentified environmental bottleneck(s) plus the acquisition of low-fidelity PB1\u2013216G by an NA-275H A/H1N1 virus that remained continuously present in the population, which allowed it to undergo adaptive mutation at a higher rate than that of the higher-fidelity oseltamivir-resistant NA-275Y/PB1\u2013216S viruses, thereby contributing to the extinction of PB1\u2013216S viruses following the 2009 pandemic.",

            "text": "The data in Additional file 1: Table S1 show that, prior to the midpoint of 2009, oseltamivir resistance was associated almost exclusively with NA-275Y viruses, whereas five additional, distinctly different NA mutations (S246 N, D198G, D198N, D198GY, and Y155H) were also associated with oseltamivir resistance following the 2009 pandemic. Whole genome analysis focusing on the PB1 and NA sequences confirmed this pattern in oseltamivir resistance in NA-H275Y/PB1\u2013216S viruses, and showed that, while most NA-H275H/PB1\u2013216G viruses were oseltamivir sensitive, those that were resistant to oseltamivir contained at least one of the above-mentioned NA mutations, in addition to the predominant H275Y (Table 2). The lower prevalence of oseltamivir-resistant NA-H275Y in human PB1\u2013216G-A/H1N1 viruses was apparently not due to the absence of the permissive secondary mutations, NA-241I and NA-369 K, that confer robust fitness in NA-275Y viruses [39] Although the prevalence of NA-241I and NA-369 K decreased temporarily during the second half of 2009, both of these permissive secondary mutations had become predominant once again in 2011 (Additional file 1: Table S1). These observations suggested that the greater diversity of NA mutations conferring oseltamivir resistance among current human A/H1N1 influenza viruses is the result of higher mutation frequency due to PB1\u2013216G-driven low-fidelity RdRp, which facilitates adaptive mutations in NA under the selective pressure of NAIs, such as oseltamivir.",

Our results suggest that the presence of the mammalian signature, PB1\u2013216G, in human A/H1N1 viruses reduces RdRp fidelity, which confers a growth advantage by increasing the probability of adaptive mutations, relative to that of human A/H1N1 viruses bearing the avian signature, PB1\u2013216S. Our results also suggest that, with a canonical low-fidelity RdRp, the increased adaptability and fitness of PB1\u2013216G viruses in human host were the biological mechanisms underlying the replacement of PB1\u2013216S viruses with relative higher fidelity RdRp following the emergence of pdmH1N1. Therefore, continued surveillance of such naturally occurring PB1\u2013216 variants among others is warranted to assess the potential impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological fitness of human A/H1N1 influenza viruses.",
