Though CHIKV was isolated almost five decades ago, however the last decade witnessed numerous major outbreaks spanning different continents. It is now reported from both old and new world and is recognized as a global public health concern. The incursion of African genotype into Asia and Asian genotype into Americas led to massive unprecedented outbreaks in na\u00efve population2,3. CHIKV infection in human may last for 1\u201310 days and the clinical spectrum ranges from acute infection to severe complications4\u20137. The higher number of severe cases indicates an urgent need to develop safe and effective medical countermeasures against CHIKV. Currently there is no licensed vaccine or therapeutics available against CHIKV.",

            "text": "CHIKV belongs to the family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus1,8. CHIKV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which encodes two polyproteins viz non-structural and structural. During viral replication, non-structural polyprotein is processed into four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4) responsible for viral replication and evasion from the host defence mechanisms. In addition structural polyprotein is processed into various proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, E1) that are involved in viral particle assembly9. Currently, targeting viral enzymes that are crucial for viral replication is believed to be an attractive strategy for development of antiviral therapy. The CHIKV nsP2 protein is a multifunctional protein. The C-terminal domain of nsP2 acts as papain-like cysteine proteases (nsP2pro) with conserved catalytic dyad (Cys and His)9,10. The nsP2pro domain is responsible for cytoplasmic cleavages of polypeptide nsP123/1234 at junctions between nsP1/nsP2, nsP2/nsP3, and nsP3/nsP4 (AGA/GII, AGC/APS and AGG/YIF respectively)9,10. Thus, the pivotal role of nsP2pro in CHIKV replication makes it a potential antiviral target, as disruption of protease activity is lethal for virus. Inhibition of viral protease has already been successfully exploited for development of antiviral compounds against Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus11\u201313. These successes have generated immense interest for development of protease inhibitors against other viral infections.",

The cell based assay has been low to medium throughput due to involvement of multiple steps. Moreover, their exact targets remain unknown and specificity is relatively low.

Screening of selected clones by sequencing revealed correct reading frame. SDS-PAGE analysis of the expressed protein on induction with 1 mM IPTG, showed expression of ~71 kDa CHIKV nsP2pro fusion protein with a dual (His6-GST) affinity tag.

Optimization of inducer concentration, temperature and induction time (18 \u00b0C, 0.5 mM IPTG, overnight) resulted in higher expression level of soluble CHIKV nsP2pro (~75%).",

GST protein was also expressed and purified under native condition to be used as a control to confirm digested GST moiety size and as a negative control for protease assay. The yield of recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro under native condition was estimated to be 6 mg/L of shake flask culture. The reactivity of purified CHIKV nsP2pro was evaluated using three different antibodies i.e. rabbit anti-nsP2 polyclonal, anti-His monoclonal or anti-GST monoclonal antibody. The recombinant fusion protein showed the affinity to react with all three antibodies and a specific band of ~71 kDa representing recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro fusion protein was detected. To monitor the proper enterokinase cleavage of the fusion protein, the immuno-reactivity of the cleaved fraction was also confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-nsP2 polyclonal antibody with a band size of ~39 kDa. The yield of the enterokinase cleaved purified protein was estimated to be 1 mg/L of the shake flask culture (Supplementary Fig. S1).",

The conditions optimized at shake flask level were further scaled up to \u223c5 L culture in 7 L capacity bioreactor. Thus, for batch cultivation, cells were propagated in 2XLB broth supplemented with 1% glycerol and at an OD600 of 20, the culture was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. In batch run, during the growth period, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level was maintained at >20% using agitation speed up to 600 rpm and air flow rate was maintained at 4\u20139 L/min along with supplying pure oxygen whenever it was required. Initially, DO level was >30% and it started declining during the course of growth of cells. Figure 1a\u2013c shows the growth profile of the batch fermentation process. This study yielded ~22 g/L (>100 g/batch) of wet cell paste that was frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C till further use. Protease purified from long term stored pellet did not reveal any loss of yield and activity (Supplementary Fig. S1). The final dry cell weights were 1.2 and 7.2 g/L in shake flask and bioreactor respectively. Purification resulted in ~62 mg/L of nsP2pro fusion protein and 6 mg/L untagged nsP2pro (Fig. 1d,e). Purified protein was further characterized by MALDI-TOF analysis. The trypsin digested fusion protein gave multiple peptide peaks, 18 peptides for CHIKV nsP2pro and 14 peptides for GST were detected with the help of MASCOT search using NCBI database (Fig. 1f).",

Although, fluorescence unit of test reaction with these substrate were found higher than the background signal but a proper enzyme curve with time was not obtained (Supplementary Fig. S2). Subsequently, a highly sensitive FRET-based octapeptide substrate (DABCYL-Arg-Ala-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Phe-Ser-(Glu-EDANS)-NH2) was used for determining the activity of CHIKV nsP2protease. The active CHIKV nsP2protease exhibits the efficient cleavage of the substrate peptide, which separates fluorophore, 5-[(2-aminoethyl) amino] naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) and quencher, 4-[(4-(dimethylamino) phenyl-azo] benzoic acid (DABCYL) resulting in the increased fluorescence signal. Fluorescence profile for the hydrolysis of the FRET-based substrate with time is depicted in Fig. 2a. A control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in the fluorescence intensity. Finally, experiments were carried out to estimate kinetic parameters of CHIKV nsP2pro by carrying out assay with increasing substrate concentration (Fig. 2b). Enzyme kinetic constant Km and Vmax derived were 0.98 \u00b1 0.135 \u00b5M and 0.77 \u00b1 0.024 \u00b5M min\u22121 respectively (Fig. 2c). Therefore, a proper reaction velocity saturation curve was obtained using longer FRET-based peptide substrate. Further, purified mutated C478A CHIKV nsP2pro was used as a negative control. C478A CHIKV nsP2pro was not able to cleave the substrate efficiently indicating that the C478 is crucial for nsP2pro activity. (Supplementary Fig. S3).",

The optimal pH was found to be 8, and lower pH impaired nsP2pro activity significantly in comparison to higher pH (Fig. 3a). The optimal temperature for protease activity was found to be 22\u201328 \u00b0C (Fig. 3b). The effect of glycerol (anti-chaotropic agent) was also observed. At 10\u201320% glycerol concentration slight increase in protease activity was seen. However, further increase in glycerol concentration resulted in the decrease of protease activity (Fig. 3c). The results with different Na+ concentrations indicated that the optimal concentration was around 50\u2013100 mM and that the enzyme is relatively insensitive to Na+ (Fig. 3d). Effect of different divalent cations like Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Mg2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+ were studied on activity of nsP2pro. Although Mg2+ or Ca2+ did not affected protease activity however, Cu2+ (p value = 0.0005), Zn2+ (p value = 0.0002), and Hg2+ (p value = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u22125) decreased protease activity remarkably (Fig. 3e). Further, the effect of different universal protease inhibitors was also tested. The enzyme was completely resistant to the inhibitors of serine proteases (PMSF, trypsin protease inhibitor I), aspartic proteases (pepstatin) and metalloproteases (EDTA). It was moderately inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitor (leupeptin; p value = 0.05) followed by chymostatin (p value = 0.008) (Fig. 3f). The addition of sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; p value = 0.002) and methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS; p value = 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22127), almost completely inhibited the protease activity of rCHIKV nsP2pro. Moreover, the addition of DTT or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), partially restored the enzyme activity inhibited by MMTS, indicating that Cys residue in the catalytic site of CHIKV nsP2pro is important for the proteolytic activity (Fig. 3g).",

No robust protocols for large scale production and purification of rCHIKV nsP2pro have been described so far. Therefore, HCDC batch fermentation was performed to produce large amount of biomass for purification of rCHIKV nsP2pro using 7 L volume bioreactor (with ~5 L working volume). The cultivation medium used for batch run was 2X LB with 1% glycerol. The components of the growth media are important for enhancement of product yield as well as reduction in by-product formations. Different cultivation medium like LB, TB and SB with some modifications were tried at small scale, results were satisfactory using simple 2XLB with 1% glycerol regarding overall yield of a bioactive enzyme. Glycerol reduces the acetate formation and also used as an antifoaming agent28. Final dry cell weight after the batch process was found to be increased more than 10 times when compared with that of the shake flask culture. This work yielded ~22 g/L of wet cell paste, which upon purification resulted in ~62 mg/L of GST-nsP2pro and 6 mg/L active untagged protease. The yield was superior to shake flasks and proved to be an efficient, easy to run, and inexpensive method for production of active protease.",

Fluorescence-based approaches have been widely used in assays for proteases and other drug targets mainly because of their high sensitivity. For development of HTS assay two different approaches have been used to measure protease activity i.e., FI and FRET based. The success of FI based assays remained ambiguous for alphaviruses16, though this was reported successful for flaviviruses29,30. In this study, Boc-AGG-MCA substrate was used in FI assay. Although, florescence unit of test reaction was found higher than the background signal but a proper enzyme curve with time was not obtained. Therefore, we tried similar type of substrates (Boc-AGG-AMC) with different fluorophore (AMC), but similar result was observed. Subsequently, FRET based substrate (DABCYL -RAGGYIFS-(E-EDANS)-NH2) was used with success. FRET based substrate are reported to be superior than FI based substrate for characterization of endopeptidases due to its low background signal24. The cleavage site preference of the CHIKV nsP2pro enzyme is nsP3-nsP4 > nsP1-nsP2 > nsP2-nsP39. Since nsP3-nsP4 substrate is preferred for cleavage in trans31, we used this in our study. Further, mutated protease, C478A CHIKV nsP2pro used as a negative control was not able to cleave the substrate efficiently indicating that the C478 is crucial for nsP2pro activity.",

Out of these divalent cations Hg2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ remarkably decreased protease activity. Zinc and its conjugates have been proven effective for inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in vivo as identified by inhibition of viral proteases in a biochemical assay34. Thus, we were interested in testing the influence of metal conjugated compound on CHIKV nsP2 protease activity. We first examined the ZnAc in our biochemical assay, which inhibited protease similarly like Zn2+. As ZnAc is FDA approved drug and is already used as therapeutics in humans35, therefore we further tested the efficacy of ZnAc to inhibit CHIKV on Vero cells. Interestingly, it was found to significantly inhibit CHIKV titer by more than 3 log. The mechanism of action of ZnAc has been successfully reported for Wilson\u2019s disease, where it act on metallothionein, a family of cysteine-rich proteins34. Therefore, ZnAc might also inhibit the CHIKV cysteine protease in a similar manner. Further, docking studies showed that zinc has the highest possibility of binding to the catalytic dyad Cys and His at the active site. Similar zinc coordination sites are observed in the crystal structures of caspase-3 and mammalian NOS regulator dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase. In caspase-3, the residues Cys163 and His121 along with two water molecules stabilize the Zn ion in the active site36. In the structure of the mammalian NOS regulator dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, the Cys273 and His172 along with two water molecules stabilize the Zn ion in the active site with Asp78 residue showing coordination with water molecules37. Therefore, this opens the scope for repurposing ZnAc and testing of other FDA approved metal conjugated drugs against CHIKV that can offer significant advantage with respect to fast track drug development.",

Thus, a robust and sensitive method for identification of nsP2protease inhibitors in a HTS format was developed with the goal of identifying compounds with anti-CHIKV drug activity. We have optimized the signal window (S/B > 5) of the assay by determining the most favourable assay parameters such as pH, temperature, salt tolerance, assay buffer, assay stability and volume. Finally, the optimized assay was statistically validated for use in a FRET-based HTS biochemical assay for screening SMIs with low variability. Thus, a reliable and reproducible assay have been developed with Z\u2019-factor 0.67 \u00b1 0.054 and intra-plate, inter-plate, day to day variability of CV < 10%. This platform provides an opportunity for identification of potent nsP2pro inhibitors for subsequent use as lead molecule, which would potentially provide drugs capable of treating CHIKV infection in the near future. Further, identification of zinc and its conjugate (ZnAc) as an inhibitor of CHIKV nsP2pro in this study provides an opportunity for repurposing of these kind of approved drugs and mineral supplements for antiviral therapy against CHIKV infection.",
