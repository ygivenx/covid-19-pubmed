This places a large burden on healthcare services in primary and secondary care but also puts patients with chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)[1] and asthma at risk of an exacerbation[2, 3]. During epidemics, viruses can also lead to death as has been demonstrated with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [4, 5], particularly in the young and elderly[6\u20138]. Therefore, identifying viruses and monitoring the severity of their effects will always remain a major scientific and clinical endeavor.",

The surveillance system was setup in 2003 using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect 5 viruses: Influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza and adenovirus and 3 viruses were added in 2010: human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (hRV) and coronavirus.

The average detection rates of viruses in incidental studies during exacerbations of asthma were much lower at 24%, with 32% in children and only 13% in adults[18]. Furthermore, virus detection was more prevalent when asthmatics were more symptomatic with wheeze, likely due to a more severe acute illness[18]. Therefore, the low rates of % positive viruses in our study could be explained by the fact that this was an unselected population of the whole of Ontario with children and adults, ED visits likely represent less severe illness in asthma compared with COPD.",

A recent pooled meta-analysis of 60 studies across all ages and continents found the prevalence of respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbations was <15%, except hRV which was 42%[21]. Although hRV had the highest prevalence in both children and adults, there were some notable difference: children were more positive for RSV and hRV, whilst adults were more positive for influenza, coronavirus and parainfluenza. These age-related changes in viral detection rates was also evident during the yearly cycle, where children <3 month were mainly positive between the months of Jan-March, whilst those aged between 3\u201318 were positive in Sept-Nov[22]. Human rhinovirus also occurs in seasonal epidemics in our data, particularly in seasons where influenza and RSV epidemics are much lower. Previously 20% of all hospital admissions of school aged children in Canada were shown to occur in September, attributed predominantly to hRV[23, 24]. Importantly, hRV has recently also been linked with mortality in asthmatics, elderly and in those in long term care facilities [25\u201327]. It is likely that factors related to hRV species and type [28], along with age, host risk factors determine the severity of symptoms on presentation to the ED may explain the lack of overall relationship to viral epidemics in our data. Data relating to the effects of age and gender in our dataset is not yet to be fully available but will add an important dimension to the current data.",

The Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System (OASIS) estimated the actual prevalence of asthma at 12.6% in 2003 and 15.3% in 2013, an increase of 22%[29]. This is calculated using a health administrative data case definition of \u2265 2 outpatient claims in 2 consecutive years or \u2265 1 hospitalization(s) for asthma. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) estimates that the age-standardized prevalence rates of \u2018active\u2019 cases, defined as at least one physician claim or \u2265 1 hospitalizations(s) among Canadian in 2003 was 3.3% and this decreased to 2.8%, representing a fall in incidence rates from 723 per 105 to 499 per 105 [30] This suggests that although prevalence of asthma is increasing, the healthcare utilization is decreasing, likely due to improved care and treatment.",

First, this analysis was done on 2 separate databases which are unlinked and hence a positive virus detection is not linked with the individual attending the ED. However, the accuracy and validity of the database can be corroborated by the peak in ED visits and hospitalizations with RTIs but not COPD seen in 2009 due to the H1N1 epidemic. Second, the database is based on coding performed by physicians and administrators in the healthcare system, hence there is a potential for miss-classification. Third, the study was not designed to investigate co-infection with multiple viruses. Fourth, as this is a population-based database, we do not have access to additional potentially confounding variables such as medical co-morbidities, allergy status, and medication usage, however, we are currently in the process of acquiring the data for age and gender. Fifth, we do not have information about the day the clinical sample for virus testing was taken in relation to the start of the symptoms. It is possible that virus detection rates may be able altered depending on the day the test was done. Sixth, we do have quantitative PCR data for viral loads, which may be useful at investigating the strength of relationship between virus, severity of illness and hospitalizations. Seventh, each hospital performs nasopharyngeal swabs on the individual patients at their respective sites and different multiplex PCR panels and assays are used for virus testing as universal use of a single multiplex panel is unlikely to be achieved. Each laboratory is licensed in Ontario and are required to undergo quality assurance, auditing and proficiency testing conducted by The Institute for Quality Management in Healthcare.",
