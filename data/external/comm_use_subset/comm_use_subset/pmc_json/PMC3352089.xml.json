            "text": "Disulfide bonds are important in maintaining the structure of extracellular and\nsecreted proteins, but it is now apparent that some disulfide bonds are labile and\ntheir reduction leads to functional changes [1,2].\nThe uptake of some viruses such as HIV [3], Newcastle disease virus [4] and hepatitis C virus [5] is redox-dependent. Platelet activation is associated with\nredox-induced changes at the cell surface [6,7]. Disulfide bonds in\nthe \u03b22 integrins and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 integrin maintain their low\naffinity state, and thrombus formation is controlled by the redox state of disulfide\nbonds in the beta chain of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 [8,9].\nThe affinity of integrins on other cell types can also be modulated by reducing\nagents [10]. For example, the\n\u03b14 chain integrin \u03b14\u03b21 was shown to have free sulfydryl groups\non treatment of cells with reducing agents [10,11]. The powerful anti-microbial activity of human \u03b2-defensin-1\nis revealed after reduction of disulfide bonds [12]. IL-4 has been shown to contain a disulfide bond\nsusceptible to mild reduction [13].\nSome ligands for cell surface receptors are also redox sensitive (e.g. MICA) [14]. Immunization increases the\nnumber of free thiols in lymph nodes [15]. Activation of T cells by dendritic cells leads to secretion of\nthioredoxin (TRX) into the extracellular space [16], where it can catalyse reduction of disulfide\nbonds on the surface of cells with which it comes into contact. This activation and\nTRX secretion can be limited by the addition of regulatory T cells [17,18]. In a model of arthritis, disease susceptibility\nwas shown to correlate with the level of free thiols at the surface of T cells, and\nthis was dependent on intracellular reactive oxygen levels [19], suggesting a role for redox chemistry in\nautoimmunity. Combined, these data suggest a central role for redox chemistry at the\ncell surface in controlling the levels of the immune response to antigen.",

After reduction, the proteins with labile disulfide bonds were\nlabelled with maleimide-PEO2-biotin (MPB). This enabled these proteins to\nbe purified by avidin affinity chromatography and, following digestion with trypsin,\nto be identified by mass spectrometry. Leucocyte membrane proteins with labile\ndisulfide bonds were surprisingly common and included various classes of proteins\nsuch as integrins, transporters and adhesion proteins, suggesting the activity of\nmany proteins may be modulated by redox changes during immune responses [20]. One protein identified in these\nscreens was CD132, which is the common signalling component (\u03b3c)\nof the receptors for several cytokines, namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and\nIL-21 [22]. IL-2 plays a central\nrole in T cell activation and regulation [23\u201325], and we\nnow show that reduction of this disulfide in the CD132 chain of its receptor has a\nmarked effect on IL-2 signalling. This suggests that responsiveness to IL-2 (and\npossibly other cytokines) may be modulated by changes in the redox environment that\noccur during immune responses.",

The\npeptides identified by mass spectrometry are summarized in table 1. The three enzymatic\nreductants gave similar peptide coverage, which was higher than seen by TCEP\nreduction, an observation seen for other proteins in the global screen [20]. One Cys residue in CD132 was\nidentified as an MPB-labelled peptide with the sequence C*LQYLVQYR (table 1; the asterisk indicates\nthe modified Cys residue), the MS/MS spectrum for this peptide obtained after\nPDI reduction (similar spectra were obtained for the other reducing agents) is\nshown in figure\n1a. This indicates that this Cys (residue 183)\noriginated from a disulfide bond that was reduced by the mild reducing\nconditions described above and previously [20]. A peptide containing Cys232, the\nother residue that makes up this disulfide bond, was not detected with an MPB\nlabel. However, it was detected in an unmodified carboimidomethyl form. The\nprotein sequence of mCD132 and identified peptides are shown in figure 1b. The MPB\nlabel reduces the ionization efficiency of the peptide compared with unlabelled\ncarboimidomethyl Cys (C. Metcalfe 2011, unpublished data) containing peptides,\nthus it is possible that the Cys232-containing peptide was\nundetectable under the conditions employed in the study. Under TRX- and\nGILT-reducing conditions, the C*LQYLVQYR peptide was detected with both\nMPB and carbamidomethyl modifications, indicating that modification of both Cys\nresidues of the labile disulfide bond was not 100 per cent efficient. In the\nin vivo, LPS inflammation model CD132 was detected although\nno MPB modified peptide was detected in CD132 or indeed any other protein [20]. This is due to the\ncomplexity of the sample. Peptides originate from proteins of many different\ncell types and therefore will be present at levels at the limit of detection of\nour mass spectrometry system. Only a small percentage of these peptides will be\nlabelled with MPB and are therefore unlikely to be identified on probability\ngrounds. \n",

            "text": "The structure of the CD132 ectodomain has been determined in complexes of both\nthe human IL-2 and IL-4 receptors with IL-2 and IL-4, respectively (reviewed by\nLaPorte et al. [26]). CD132 contains two fibronectin type III domains. The peptide\ncontaining the MBP modified Cys identified in mouse CD132 (see above)\ncorresponds to Cys160 that forms a disulfide bond with\nCys209 in these structures for human CD132 (figure 2). This domain type has a fold similar to\nan Ig-like domain consisting of two beta sheets but it usually lacks disulfide\nbonds in the typical Ig inter-sheet position. However, in some cases disulfide\nbonds are present, such as the Cys160\u2013Cys209\ndisulfide of CD132. This disulfide bond is unusual in that it is at the surface\nof the protein (figure\n2a) with a large solvent accessibility area of 56\n\u00c52 (compared with a structure average of 19\n\u00c52) when calculated in the absence of IL-2, which is\npresumably the state under which redox regulation would occur. This\nCys160\u2013Cys209 disulfide bond is relatively\nshort, with a C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 of 5.3 \u00c5 compared with an\naverage of 5.9 \u00c5 for the other disulfide bonds present in the IL-2 and\nIL-4 receptor structures. These features are compatible with the possibility\nthat this disulfide bond might be readily reduced. A recent bioinformatics study\nthat analysed all of the disulfide bonds in the protein data bank based on\nsolvent accessibility, C\u03b1\u2013C\u03b1 distance and an estimation of\ntorsion strain on the S\u2013S bonds [1,2] concluded that\nthe most common configuration of the known allosteric disulfide bonds is the\n\u2013RHStaple. A feature of \u2013RHStaple bonds is the close proximity of\nthe \u03b1-carbon atoms of the two cysteine residues [27,28]. In both of these structures, the\nCys160\u2013Cys209 disulfide bond sits at the\ninterface of CD132, linking two beta loops as shown in figure 2c with the cytokine in\ndirect contact with the helix bundle. The possibility that mild reducing\nconditions typical of those found in T cell activation might reduce this\ndisulfide bond enough to affect the ability of IL-2 to bind and signal through\nthe receptor was investigated.

A similar reduction of IL-2 could account\nfor, or at least contribute to, the effects seen on the HT-2 cell line. To test\nthis, recombinant rat IL-2 was incubated under the same reducing conditions\nknown to give extensive inhibition of HT-2 cell proliferation. N-ethylmaleimide\n(NEM) was added to modify any free sulfydryl residues generated. The IL-2\nprotein was denatured with urea, fully reduced with TCEP and alkylated with\niodoacetamide (IAA). The protein was digested with trypsin and peptides analysed\nby mass spectrometry. The Cys-containing peptides were analysed for differential\nlabelling with the two thiol-reactive agents using a simple semi-quantitative\nanalysis based on the total ion counts of the peptides' precursor scan\npeaks. This showed that for the FECQFDDEPATVVEFLR peptide less than 1 per cent\ncontained the NEM-modified Cys compared with the IAA-modified Cys (non-reduced\nin the native protein) and for the HLQCLENELGALQR peptide about 28 per cent was\nin the NEM-modified form (table\n2). These data were almost identical to a control that had not been\nreduced. The NEM modification observed was probably due to some denatured\nprotein in the IL-2 preparation. This indicates that the disulfide bond in IL-2\nwas not labile. IL-2 and IL-4 contain one and three disulfide bonds,\nrespectively, and these disulfide bonds are conserved across several species.\nX-ray crystal structures are not available for rat or mouse IL-2 or IL-4, but\nhuman structures are available for both (figure 4). The tertiary structures of human IL-2 and IL-4 are very\nsimilar (figure\n4a), with good overlay of the 4-helix bundle. Both\nstructures contain a disulfide bond between the second helix of the bundle and\nan external loop (figure\n4b,c). IL-4 contains two further\ndisulfide bonds (figure\n4b) and IL-2 contains a conserved\n\u2018free\u2019 cysteine buried inside of the 4-helix bundle (figure 4c). Figure 4d\nshows the calculated solvent accessibility for all of the disulfide bonds in\nIL-2 and IL-4.

The specific\ndisulfide in CD132 was identified using a variety of mild reducing agents including\nPDI, TRX and GILT. CD132 was also one of many proteins identified in a model of\ninflammation. The detailed structural knowledge of CD132 in structures of the\nreceptors and their complexes with IL-2 and IL-4 allows the molecular consequences\nto be examined [24,26,33].

From these\ndata, we would predict that disulfides that are solvent-exposed and at the interface\nwith the cytokine may be affected by redox changes with functional effects. Exposed\ndisulfide bonds are not common in other cytokine receptors where there are\nstructural data; for example, none of the disulfides in the interleukin-28 receptor\nsubunit alpha (or interferon-lambda receptor 1; PDB; 3OG6) is exposed. The tumour\nnecrosis factor (TNF) receptor family members are characterized by a high content of\ndisulfide bonds, but in the TNF\u2013TNFR2 structure (PDB; 3ALQ) two Cys residues\nare in contact with the ligand (TNF), but their partners are solvent-inaccessible.\nHowever, there are data to show that TRX 1 can reduce disulfide bonds in the TNF\nreceptor family member CD30 giving altered cytokine binding [38]. This study showed that other TNF receptor family\nmembers were not modified, pointing to selected cytokine receptors being affected.\nThus, the activity of some cytokines may be moderated in immune responses by changes\nin redox potential modulated by the release of enzymes such as PDI.
