            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a common human respiratory virus and causes seasonal epidemic and pandemic infections. In the past 100 years, pandemics of influenza have been caused by the IAV strains H1N1 (1918), H2N2 (1957), H3N2 (1968) and H1N1 (2009) [1,2]. These pandemic strains vary in their virulence and pathogenicy. Compared to the 1968 and 2009 pandemics, the 1957 pandemic featured intermediate pathogenicity, while the virus causing the 1918 pandemic was relatively highly pathogenic in the human population [2]. Currently we are threatened by sporadic infections by emerging avian IAVs, including highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses [1,3]. Two well known, highly pathogenic IAVs, 1918 H1N1 and avian H5N1 cause high levels of morbidity including excessive infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the lungs, high viral loads and hypercytokinemia, with significant increases of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, CXCL10 and CCL2 in the patients\u2019 plasma [4-6]. Thus, cytokines and chemokines induced at high levels by IAV infections have become targets for the development of IAV therapy. However, the results of experiments using knock-out mice indicate that none of them alone determines highly pathogenic virus-induced lethality [7,8]. Thus, we used another approach to identify the immune cell types that are recruited during infection and contribute to the excessive inflammatory responses during highly pathogenic virus infection.",

Using these mouse models, we demonstrated that rate of viral clearance and disease severity is correlated with the numbers of a defined Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid population in the lung. Until now, it is not clear how and why they accumulate in the severely inflamed lung. In this study, we selected this cell population as a target to investigate the extreme inflammatory response during severe IAV infection.",

            "text": "In this paper, we report that CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes are the major cell components in this defined Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid population. Multiple roles of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes during viral infections have been reported: promoting host survival of West Nile virus-induced encephalitis and IAV and mouse hepatitis virus infections [9-12], stimulating anti-viral Th1 immunity in HSV-2 infection [13] and suppressing anti-viral CD8 T cell responses in mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections [14,15]. These results indicate that CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes play a double edge sword in anti-viral responses and immunopathogenesis. Using established infection models with variable rates of viral clearance, which are accompanied by different levels of inflammatory infiltrates, we found that an amplified inflammatory chemokine feedback loop links the impaired clearance of highly pathogenic virus and a massive infiltration of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes. So, we sought to investigate which cell types are responsible for the production of CCR2 ligands. Furthermore, we identified the inflammatory signals that are triggered by an impaired anti-viral response to induce expression of CCR2 ligands. Finally, the pathological effects of excessive accumulated CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were explored during highly pathogenic IAV infection.",

As shown in Figure 1A, mice infected with the mild 141 strain lost 5%-10% of their original body weight, while the moderate SOIV strain caused 15%-20% original body weight loss. Notably, severe PR8 infection caused progressive weight loss and led to 100% mortality in the infected mice at day 7\u201310 post-infection. In these infections, lung inflammation was dramatically correlated with body weight loss at day 7 post-infection (Figure 1B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that a defined Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid population is preferentially recruited to the infected lung, but only few to MLN (Figure 1C). Of interest, the total numbers of infiltrating leukocytes and Gr1 + CD11b + cells were significantly associated with the severity of inflammation (Figure 1D and E). Gr1 + CD11b + cells are a heterogeneous cell population, so the true identity of major infiltrating cells should be further characterized using the Wright stain and by the expression of Ly6G and Ly6C on cell surface. Gr1 + CD11b + sorted cells consisted mostly of mononuclear cells containing abundant cytoplasmic vacuoles and few segmented granulocytes (Figure 1F, upper panel). Furthermore, Gr1 + CD11b + cells are composed of appoximately 68-81% monocytes (Ly6G-Ly6Chigh) and 19-32% granulocytes (Ly6G + Ly6Cintermediate) (Figure 1F, lower panel). Using specific Abs against surface CCR2 and CX3CR1, we further demonstrated that the infiltrating monocytes in the lungs were Ly6ChighCCR2+ inflammatory monocytes but not Ly6ClowCX3CR1+ patrolling monocytes (Figure 1G). Importantly, the numbers of infiltrating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were highly associated with the severity of inflammation (Figure 1H).",

According to the results of protein arrays, levels of G-CSF, CCL1, CCL2, CCL12, IL-10, CXCL9, IL-16 and CCL5 were correlated with the severity of lung inflammation (Figure 2A). Notably, both CCL2 and CCL12 are ligands of CCR2, in addition to CCL7. So, we speculated that the aggressive recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes is linked to expression of CCR2 ligands. In Figure 1C, we found that Gr1 + CD11b + cells preferentially migrate to the lung but not to MLN. Therefore, we suggested that leukocytes infiltrating the lung may frequently induce CCR2 ligands to attract CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes. Indeed, all transcripts of CCR2 ligands were over 4000 fold higher in the lung than in MLN (Figure 2B). In addition, the levels of CCR2 ligands in sera were clearly correlated with the numbers of infiltrating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes (Figure 2C). These results suggested that robust expression of CCR2 ligands may contribute to the aggressive recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes into the lungs.",

Compared to leukocytes in the lungs of na\u00efve mice, infiltrating leukocytes harvested from virus-infected mice had tens- to thousands-fold induction of CCR2 ligands (Figure 3B). The relative fold induction of CCR2 ligands was similar between total leukocytes and Gr1 + CD11b + sorted cells, suggesting that Gr1 + CD11b + cells are probably the main producers of CCR2 ligands. To confirm that CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were producers of CCR2 ligands, granulocytes and monocytes were sorted from the Gr1 + CD11b + myeloid population (Figure 3C). As shown in Figure 3D, both cell types could express CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12, but more expression of these CCR2 ligands was seen in monocytes.

Previous studies indicated that signaling pathways of MyD88 and type I IFN could modulate the recruitment of myeloid cells [19,20]. Therefore, MyD88\u2212/\u2212 and IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice were used in this study. Compared to infected WT and MyD88\u2212/\u2212 mice, the expression of CCR2 ligands by Gr1 + CD11b + cells was significantly reduced in infected IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 4A). In addition, we found that the percentage of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes was only reduced in IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In Figure 4B, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes accounted for 81.8 \u00b1 1.1% of total leukocytes in infected WT mice and 84.5 \u00b1 4.5% in infected MyD88 deficient mice; however, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes accounted for only 39.8 \u00b1 0.35% in infected IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Thus, accumulation of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes was suppressed when the IFNAR1-induced expression of CCR2 ligands was interrupted. Because aggressive recruitment of Gr1 + CD11b + cells was observed after day 3 post-infection (Figure 1E), we wondered whether intranasal treatment with an anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody at day 3 post-infection could interrupt the influx of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes. In Figure 4C and D, the recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes was reduced significantly in anti-IFNAR1 blocking antibody-treated mice, but not in isotype control-treated mice. Overall, these data implied that excessive recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes contributes to continuous activation of IFNAR1-induced expression of CCR2 ligands.",

Recent study has shown that induction of CCL2 and CCL7 is triggered by the IFNAR1-IFN\u03b2 signaling in IFNAR2\u2212/\u2212 mice [21]. In addition, we also observed differential expression of CCR2 ligands among Gr1 + CD11b + sorted cells in 141, SOIV and PR8 infections (Figure 3B). Therefore, we examined the expression levels of IFN\u03b2 in all infected mice. As expected, expression of IFN\u03b2 as detected only in the Gr1 + CD11b + sorted cells harvested from PR8-infected mice at day 7 post-infection (Figure 5A). In addtion, both granulocytes and monocytes in Gr1 + CD11b + population could express IFN\u03b2 (data not shown). Because detectable IFN\u03b2 production reflects activated viral replication, the anti-viral responses of the host were examined by measuring virus titers and detecting influenza NP expression in the infected lung. As shown in Figure 5B and C, 141-infected mice completely eliminated the virus at day 7. SOIV-infected mice still showed weak expression of NP at day 7 and the host completely cleared the virus at day 8 post-infection. Of note, PR8-infected lungs still showed strong NP expression and viral replication at day 7\u20138 post-infection. These data suggested that the duration of IFN\u03b2 production is a function of the rate of viral clearance. Next, we sought to explore why Gr1 + CD11b + cells produce abundant IFN\u03b2 in PR8-infected mice in the late phase of infection. We hypothesized that recruited CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes are infected by the PR8 virus, resulting in amplified production of IFN\u03b2. Indeed, expression of influenza NP was detected in CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes in PR8-infected mice (Figure 5D). Thus, our results suggested that impaired clearance of PR8 virus prolonged expression of IFN\u03b2, which led to infected CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes amplifying their own recruitment by an IFNAR1-triggered chemokine feedback loop. To determine whether high viral loads are potent inducers for CCR2+ monocyte infiltration, an anti-viral drug, Oseltamivir, was used to suppress virus replication in infected mice. In Figure 5E, body weight loss was attenuated when infected mice received Oseltamivir treatment, demonstrating the efficacy of Oseltamivir. Influx of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes was dramatically reduced in Oseltamivir-treated mice, compared to PBS-treated mice (Figure 5F). Taken together, our results supported the concept that continuous recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes by the IFNAR1-triggered chemokine feedback loop is attributable to the extended duration of IFN\u03b2 expression in the late phase of infection.",

In general, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes are generated from the BM and migrate rapidly to inflamed sites following pathogen invasion [22]. Therefore, we first checked the proportions of Gr1 + CD11b + cells and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes in the PBMC and BM during infection. As shown in Figure 6A-D, the proportion of Gr1 + CD11b + cells and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes in the PBMC was positively correlated with disease severity. In contrast, the proportion of CCR2+ monocytes in the BM was inversely correlated with the severity of inflammation (Figure 6E). In Figure 6F, total CCR2+ monocytes were significantly decreased in the BM of PR8-infected mice, compared to those in 141- and SOIV-infected mice. These results implied that CCR2+ monocytes are rapidly recruited from the BM to the infected lung and mobilization of these cells is possibly dependent on the expression of CCR2 ligands. To demonstrate CCR2-mediated trafficking of inflammatory monocytes to the lungs, BM-enriched CCR2+ monocytes were isolated from na\u00efve mice, labeled with CFSE, and then adoptively transferred to na\u00efve, 141-, SOIV- or PR8-infected mice. After 2 days, transferred CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were traced by the CCR2 + CFSE + signals on the cells (Figure 6G). In Figure 6H, more transferred CCR2 + CFSE + monocytes were found in PR8-infected lungs than in those 141- and SOIV-infected lungs. CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were used to confirm that influx of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes was dependent on CCR2-triggered chemotaxis. In Figure 6I, the proportion of Gr1 + CD11b + cells was significantly decreased in infected CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, compared to WT mice. In Figure 6J, only few CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were detected in the blood and lungs of infected CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting the importance of CCR2-driven monocytes localization within the infected lung.",

To investigate the biological consequences of an excessive accumulation of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes in the lungs, CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were used to examine leukocyte infiltration, cytokine storm, expression of iNOS and the survival rate after a lethal dose challenge of PR8 virus. In the absence of infiltrating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes, total leukocytes in the lung and expression of CCL1, sICAM-1, IFN\u03b3, IL-1ra, IL-16, M-CSF, CCL2, CCL12 and CXCL9 in BALF were decreased, suggesting that CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes contribute to the expression of these molecules (Figure 7A and B). Consistent with the results from cytokine arrays, expression of CCR2 ligands was also significantly decreased in the infiltrating leukocytes of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, compared to WT mice (Figure 7C). A previous report has shown that iNOS is induced in activated myeloid cells and significantly involved in the development of IAV-induced pneumonitis [24]. As shown in Figure 7D, Gr1 + CD11b + cells were the predominant producers of iNOS. Interestingly, expression of iNOS was correlated with the severity of inflammation. To demonstrate further the importance of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes-mediated immunopathological effects, expression of iNOS and the survival rate were compared in PR8-infected WT and CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Expression of iNOS transcripts was dramatically reduced in infected CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, (Figure 7E). Finally, 38.5% of infected CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, but none of the WT mice, survived a lethal dose challenge of PR8 virus (Figure 7F). Thus, infiltrating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes play a pivotal role in highly virulent IAV infection-mediated pathological effects.",

Furthermore, infected leukocytes are the main contributors to aggressive production of inflammatory innate immune responses. Before entering the inflamed lung, these uninfected infiltrates are already primed with type I IFN, which upregulates the levels of MAD5, RIG-I and IRF7 [26,27]. In addition, these IFN-stimulated molecules coupled with viral nucleic acids are responsible for amplified production of type I IFN [28]. Our findings revealed that the rate of virus clearance determines the duration of IFN\u03b2 expression in infiltrating Gr1 + CD11b + cells. Sustained expression of IFN\u03b2 was critical for aggressive recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes in severe inflammation. When virus replication was suppressed by Oseltamivir, body weight and influx of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes were significantly reduced. These results indicated that excessive accumulation of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes plays a crucial role in the pathological outcomes of highly pathogenic H1N1 IAV infections. Recently, we are continuously threatened by sporadic infections by emerging avian influenza viruses, including highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses which rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, including excessive infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes into the lungs, high viral loads and hypercytokinemia [29,30]. Futhermore, it is worth to see whether the same phenomenon is observed in avain flu infections, such as H5N1 and H7N9. If accumulation of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes is a common phenomenon in highly pathogenic influenza infection, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes will be a good therapeutic target in infection.",

Previous reports have shown that small numbers of neutrophils are recruited early in infection, followed by influx of large numbers of monocytes [4]. Based on our result, CCR2 ligands produced by neutrophils might play a key role in the early recruitment of monocytes. In Figure 1F, the ratio of neutrophils and monocytes was skewed according to degrees of inflammation at day 7 post-infection. This result indicated two things: (1) Monocyte attractive chemokines were not only provided by neutrophils but also by other inflammatory cells. Using cell sorting, we showed that accumulated CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes are the main contributors of CCR2 ligands and then amplify their own recruitment. (2) Infiltrating monocytes might interfere with the further influx of neutrophils in severe inflammation. A previous study has demonstrated that type I IFN suppresses neutrophil-mediated chemokine attraction, CXCL1 and CXCL2, leading to impaired recruitment of neutrophils [31]. Therefore, we suggested that sustained expression of IFN\u03b2 from CCR2 inflammatory monocytes interrupts the recruitment of neutrophils. Indeed, our data are consistent with previous reports that a doubling of neutrophil numbers is observed in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 and IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice [20,32].",

However, recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes could not be completely abolished in IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that induction of CCR2 ligands in other cell types by IFNAR1-independent pathways may not be excluded. Indeed, expression of CCL2 is regulated by Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-triggered signaling in pulmonary endothelial cells or by the MyD88-mediated pathway in pulmonary epithelial cells [35-37]. In addition, IL-1R signaling is also involved in CCL2 induction in undefined cell types during IAV infection [38]. A previous study has demonstrated that mice deficient in a single ligand, either CCL2 or CCL7, only can block 40-50% monocytes egressing from the BM [39]. Thus, it is not surprising that gene deficiency of CCL2 cannot protect mice against highly pathogenic virus-mediated death [7]. Our results indicated that CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12 were highly induced during IAV infections. Therefore, blockage of any single CCR2 ligand is not sufficient to block recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes.",

In successful clearance of 141 and SOIV infecions, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes expressed high levels of IFN\u03b3R, MHC class I and MHC class II molecules than those molecules on monocytes isolated from PR8-infected mice (data not shown). Our and previous studies have demonstrated that monocytes are the mainly susceptible cell type to IAV infections [40,41]. Therefore, we suggested that the rate of viral clearance markedly determines the functional direction of inflitrating CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes toward in either protective or pathological role. In infections of MCMV and LCMV, CCR2+ inflammatory monocyte-produced large amount of iNOS and facilitate the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO plays a critical role to impair anti-CD8 T cell responses [14,15]. In our study, CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes expressed iNOS; and its expression was correlated with rate of viral clearance. Thus, these results implied that excessive accumulation of CCR2+ inflammatoy monocytes might interfere effective anti-viral CD8 T-cell responses via excessive NO prodution in highly pathogenic IAV infections.",

We achieved varying degrees of weight loss with mildly, moderately or severely inflamed lungs in mice inoculated with the 141, SOIV or PR8 strains. These H1N1 infection models with variable efficiencies of viral clearance result in the accumulation of varying numbers of CCR2+ inflammatrory monocytes, which are highly associated with the generation of a cytokine storm and expression of iNOS. In the early phase of infection, we propose that a small number of infiltratng CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes are infected with IAV and respond to autocrine and/or paracrine IFN\u03b2, which induces the expression of the CCR2 ligands, CCL2, CCL7 and CCL12. Recruited CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes drive further recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes from the BM to the lung through CCR2-dependent chemotaxis. In the late phase of infection, impaired clearance of PR8 virus leads to spread of infection to recently arrived CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes and to sustained production of the IFNAR1-IFN\u03b2 signaling axis-induced CCR2 ligands, which cause infiltrating CCR2+ inflammatrory monocytes to amplify their own recruitment continuously through the IFNAR1-dependent chemokine feedback loop.",
