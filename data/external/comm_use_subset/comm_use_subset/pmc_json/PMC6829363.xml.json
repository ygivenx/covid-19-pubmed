The resulting EVTs invade the maternal uterine tissues either through the decidualized endometrium into the inner myometrium (interstitial) or through the lumen of the uterine spiral arteries against the blood flow (endovascular) [2,3,4].",

Importantly, viral and bacterial challenges or pathological inflammatory states alter placental BCRP expression differently. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; modelling bacterial infection) decreased ABCG2 and BCRP expression in first trimester human placental explants (but not in third trimester explants). Whereas, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C) (a double-stranded viral antigen) did not induce changes in BCRP expression [12]. In sharp contrast, the placenta from preterm pregnancies complicated by chorioamnionitis exhibited increased ABCG2 and BCRP expression [13]. This indicates that the nature (source) and timing (gestational age) of infection/inflammation determines the positive or negative effects on the regulation of BCRP expression and consequently the potential fetal exposure to harmful BCRP substrates.",

During early gestation, altered levels of BCRP may affect the migration and invasion potential of these cells, thereby causing pregnancy complications, though to date, no studies have tested this hypothesis. Given the relatively high incidence of bacterial and viral infections during early human pregnancy [19] and its impact on BCRP expression, we determined the role of ABCG2 and BCRP in modulating the migration potential of EVTs, which is critical for the establishment of placentation in early pregnancy. Further, we determined the impact of bacterial (mimicked by LPS) or viral (mimicked by single stranded RNA, ssRNA) infection on these processes.",

Briefly, small clusters of 2 to 3 column cytotrophoblasts (CCT) villi presenting high vascularization and clear white tips were excised under the dissecting microscope. Tips of the villi were cleared to expose CCT stem cells, which were gently spread on the matrigel (200 \u00b5L per insert of phenol red free, Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) coated transwell inserts (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) in a 24-well culture plate. Serum free culture medium (400 \u00b5L of DMEM/F12) supplemented with Normacin (1%, Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was added to the wells beneath the inserts to keep the matrigel moist, and explants were allowed to adhere to the Matrigel overnight (37 \u00b0C, 3% O2, and 5% CO2) as described earlier [21]. The next day, 200 \u00b5L of medium was added to the inserts and the explants were incubated (for 24 h) to allow the formation of EVT outgrowths. Explant outgrowth was observed under a microscope. Only explants exhibiting EVT sprouting were included in the study. For ABCG2 knockdown, explant media was supplemented with the siABCG2 transfection complexes or scrambled control (50 nmol/L\u2014please see below). Explants were then photographed (at time zero: T0) using a Leica DFC400 camera (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) attached to a dissecting microscope. Photographs were taken after 24 h (T24) and 48 h (T48) post transfection. The area of outgrowth at T0, T24, and T48 was analyzed from the pictographs using imageJ software and percent growth was calculated by dividing the difference between the final (T24 or T48) and initial (T0) area of outgrowth with the final area of outgrowth *100. Each experiment was performed in triplicate with a total of N = 3 first trimester human placentae.",

Briefly, cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, NC, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Wisent, St Bruno, QC, Canada), 100 IU/mL of penicillin, and 100 IU/mL of streptomycin at 20% O2 (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) (Invitrogen Canada Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada). Cells were seeded (380,000 per well, respectively) in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 20% O2 (5% CO2, 37 \u00b0C) and were then treated with LPS (0.1 or 1 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or ssRNA (1 or 2.5 \u00b5g/mL; Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) for 12 h in dose ranges previously shown to elicit a trophoblast inflammatory response [12,24,25]. Cells and media were then collected and stored at 80 \u00b0C for total RNA and protein extraction or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).",

Significant down-regulation of BCRP (62.37%, Figure 2F) and ABCG2 (63.85%, Figure 2B) was observed following 48 h of siABCG2 duplex treatment. Next, we determined the specificity of siRNA against ABCG2 by examining the mRNA levels of other related ABC transporters that are known to be expressed in trophoblasts: ABCB1, ABCC2, and ABCC3 [29]. The siRNA sequences were with unique specificity against ABCG2 mRNA. Sequence alignment with other ABC transporters is shown in Figure 2A. We did not find off-target effects of siABCG2 at the dose and duration of our experiments (Figure 2C\u2013E). Similarly, we did not find differences in protein expression of another trophoblast-enriched ABC transporter, ABCA6 [29] (Figure 2G), confirming the specificity of the siABCG2 procedure. HTR8/SVneo cells were transiently transfected with siABCG2 oligos (50 nM) for 48 h (the time point where we observed significant reduction of BCRP protein levels compared to scrambled siRNA control) and were then subjected to wound-scratch assay and IncuCyteTM-facilitated imaging and analyses. We found a significant (p < 0.001) increase in HTR8/SVneo cell migration in siABCG2 transfected cells compared to the scrambled control (Figure 3A\u2013C), with no changes in cell proliferation under similar culture conditions (Figure 3D,E and Supplementary Figure S2), strongly suggesting that BCRP inhibits EVT migration. The inhibition of BCRP function using a BCRP specific inhibitor, Ko143, resulted in a similar significant increase (p < 0.05) in trophoblast migration (Figure 3F\u2013H) and did not alter HTR8/SVneo proliferation (Figure 3I,J), confirming that BCRP inhibits EVT migration.",

High dose ssRNA treatment increased levels of IL-6 (Figure 4D) and IL-8 mRNA (Figure 4F) at the high dose whereas CCL2 mRNA expression (Figure 4H) remained unchanged after treatment. Similar to mRNA expression, we found a significant decrease in BCRP protein following 12 h exposure to low and high doses of LPS and ssRNA (Figure 5A,B).

EVT migration was determined by comparing the percent EVT outgrowth in the control versus siABCG2 treated explants. There was a substantial reduction of BCRP expression in the placental villi of siABCG2 treated explants compared to the controls, as determined by immunohistochemistry (Figure 7). Silencing of ABCG2 resulted in significantly greater expansion (migration and invasion) of the EVT outgrowth on the Matrigel at 24 h (p < 0.001) and 48 h (p < 0.05) compared to the control (Figure 7A,B).

We report, for the first time, that BCRP, which is well known for its role as an efflux transporter, inhibits EVT cell migration in HTR8/SVneo (EVT-like) cells and in first trimester derived EVTs. In addition to being present in STs, BCRP is also expressed in CCTs and EVTs in human placenta during the first trimester, implicating that it has a role in EVT function. Inhibition of BCRP with siABCG2 or Ko143 increased cell migration in the HTR8/SVneo (EVT-like) cell line over 36 h, without affecting proliferation. We also demonstrated that LPS and ssRNA exposure decreased ABCG2 and BCRP expression in EVTs and stimulated EVT migration. Together, these data suggest that BCRP functions as an inhibitor of EVT migration and that infection may lead to increased EVT migration.",

It is important to note that we used a novel automated approach to monitor and analyze the migration of EVT cells. We calculated the % wound density and the area under the curve generated from the data recorded every 2 h over 36 h using IncuCyte\u2122 technology [15]. Pharmacological inhibition of BCRP resulted in a similar outcome. Interestingly, this contrasts with reports from cancer cell lines, which suggest that BCRP increases the migration of glioma and pancreatic cancer cells [16,17,30] and inhibits the proliferation in other epithelial-like cancer cell lines [14]. These differences may result from the fact that the cancer cell lines are derived from human tumors, whereas HTR8/SVneo cells are derived from physiological EVTs [23], thus illustrating different actions of BCRP modulating cell migration in physiological and in neoplastic phenotypes. Further, diverse cancer cells may commonly exhibit increased basal expression of ABCG2 and BCRP, an important mechanism conferring multidrug resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [31]. This is postulated to be an adaptation to the rearrangement of intracellular signaling pathways undertaken by malignant cells to promote invasiveness [32].",

            "text": "In a previous study, we reported that P-glycoprotein (P-gp), another ABC transporter related to ST-mediated fetal protection, reduces HTR8/SVneo cell proliferation and invasion [20]. While the contrasting actions of BCRP and P-gp in early placentation require further investigation, it is attractive to speculate that P-gp drives placentation by enhancing EVT migration/invasion, while BCRP likely controls the extent of EVT penetration within the decidua. The mechanisms by which BCRP modulates EVT migration remains to be determined. BCRP may regulate the transport and activity of substrates which are critical to cell migration (such as extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules). P-gp and BCRP are known to interact with CD44 to modulate cancer cell migration/invasion [33,34]. It is also possible that P-gp and BCRP have shared mediators controlling EVT cell migration. For example, CD44 and hyaluronic acid (HA) mediate cell\u2013cell/cell\u2013matrix adhesion and, hence, affect cell migration [35,36,37], and it is documented that CD44/HA on the cell surface of EVTs are important mediators of EVT invasion [38]. The STRING database of protein\u2013protein interaction indicates interaction between CD44 and BCRP (https://string-db.org/cgi/network.pl?taskId=okGQMLlRXDFw). Based on this, it is possible to speculate that BCRP competes with P-gp for CD44 binding, interferes with the CD44/HA mediated adhesion properties of EVTs, and, hence, impedes EVT migration/invasion. This possibility requires further investigation.",

This indicates that bacterial infection in early human pregnancy has the potential to affect EVT migration through the modulation of BCRP expression. This pattern of BCRP inhibition is consistent with our previous report showing that ABCG2 and BCRP expression was decreased 24 h after exposure of first trimester human explants to LPS [12]. In the rat, previous studies have shown LPS to down-regulate placental Abcg2 mRNA [40]. No studies have investigated the effect of LPS on BCRP activity, however in mid-gestation, LPS inhibited the P-gp (encoded by Abcb1a and Abcb1b in rodents) efflux transporter in the mouse placenta [41]. Together, these studies suggest that the regulation of placental ABCG2 by LPS is gestational age-dependent. Importantly, it also indicates that bacterial infection has the potential to compromise normal EVT migration and fetal protection by inhibiting BCRP expression in EVTs and in the ST, respectively.",

There are no previous reports of ssRNA modulating placental BCRP expression, though Poly (I:C), a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that acts via TLR-3 activation [42], has been shown to decrease ABCG2 in third trimester human placental explants [12] and in the late gestation rat placenta [40].

In the present study, we showed that infection with ssRNA (which also include influenza (flu virus), rhinovirus (common cold virus), retrovirus (HIV and HTLV1), and coronavirus (upper-respiratory illnesses virus)) (Potter et al. 2015; Luo et al. 2018) in early-pregnancy has the potential to disrupt normal EVT migration and ultimately placentation, placental function, and fetal development. In this context, human placentae infected by ZIKV exhibit marked villous immaturity and increased the ratio of syncytial sprouts (syncytial nuclei aggregation at the outer trophoblastic wall) [48,49]. This provides pathological evidence of uteroplacental malperfusion, typically associated with deranged EVT migration into the decidualized endometrium, resulting in poor myometrial spiral arteries remodeling and reperfusion [50]. Further, viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections have been related to the enhancement of the likelihood of PE, through the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and anti-angiogenic proteins at the early maternal fetal interface [51].
