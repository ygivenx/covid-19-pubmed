Decades of study have resulted in an extensive knowledge on yeast physiology, genetics, and the molecular functions and interactions of its proteins. Furthermore, this unicellular eukaryotic system is well suited for the study of basic cellular processes which are often conserved in higher eukaryotes. Because of its ease for genetic modification and fast growth, yeast became the system of choice for in vivo protein analyses from other eukaryotes. S. cerevisiae was used, for example, to perform proteome-wide analysis of the human protein-protein interaction networks [1], to systematically analyze protein-DNA interaction networks of the nematode C. elegans[2], and to produce high-value bioactive plant secondary metabolites through metabolic engineering approaches [3].",

            "text": "Large scale genomics approaches to uncover protein function are adopted more and more in the current era of systems biology research. To cope with the large amounts of constructs needed, scientists make use of high-throughput cloning technologies, such as the GatewayTM technology (Invitrogen; http://www.invitrogen.com/), which is based on the site-specific recombination system from the bacteriophage lambda that facilitates the integration of the phage\u2019s DNA into the Escherichia coli chromosome [4]. DNA segments that are flanked by the appropriate recombination sites in a standard vector (pENTR) can easily be transferred to a compatible vector (pDEST) for functional analysis (Figure 1A). MultiSite GatewayTM uses modified recombination sites to allow the combination of multiple DNA segments in one single in vitro recombination reaction. The segments are joined in a pDEST in a predefined order and orientation, maintaining the reading frame and with low risk for mutations [4] (Figure 1B). Three-segment MultiSite GatewayTM makes it possible to easily make any combination of a promoter, gene and tag without the need of redesigning new destination vectors for each new experimental approach. The ability to choose a promoter allows varying temporal, spatial, and quantitative control of gene expression, while different possible tags enable the inclusion of fluorescent protein tags for localisation or epitope tags for detection or purification, or the creation of protein chimeras (Figure 2). The flexibility introduced by the MultiSite GatewayTM technology is illustrated by the large amount of \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d already made available as pENTR clones by several research groups [5-11]. Existing pENTR collections include ORFeomes from multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [12-26].",

Moreover, for plants an extensive repertoire of pDEST for two- and three-segment MultiSite GatewayTM has been established [28]. Three-segment MultiSite GatewayTM destination vectors are also available for Gram-positive bacteria [29]. In S. cerevisiae, single-segment pDEST vectors are available for yeast two-hybrid screens (Invitrogen), and two-segment (promoter::ORF) MultiSite GatewayTM vectors have been described [30]. An extensive set of single-fragment GatewayTM vectors was constructed, allowing N-terminal fusions with four fluorescent tags, and C-terminal fusions with five different fluorescent tags, an affinity tag and an epitope tag under the control of the inducible GAL1 or constitutive GPD promoter [31]. Alternatively, tags that are not present in this vector set can be fused to the gene of interest through 2-step PCR fusion [32] before performing the BP reaction. However, to our knowledge no three-segment MultiSite GatewayTM pDEST vectors exist for S. cerevisiae to date. As a consequence, a large number of commonly used protein tags already available as pENTR clones are not readily applicable in the organism that - together with E. coli - is the workhorse of molecular biology.",

The vector set features the four most commonly used auxotrophic markers for selection of yeast transformants combined with three different replication mechanisms. The presence of the CYC1 terminator in these vectors allows construction of any promoter::ORF:tag combination. In addition, a number of useful entry clones harbouring commonly used yeast promoters and entry clones with protein tags to be used with these pDESTs are presented and validated. These vectors have been appended to our collection of \u2018Gateway\u2122 vectors for functional studies\u2019 and can be ordered through the website http://gateway.psb.ugent.be/. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of this vector set by confirming the formation of a ternary complex between the jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ), the Novel Interactor of JAZ (NINJA) and the TOPLESS (TPL) proteins, with NINJA acting as a bridging protein. This complex was previously shown to be involved in jasmonate signalling in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) [33].",

This step replaced the original GatewayTM cassette and the eukaryotic promoter from the pAG vectors, while maintaining the CYC1 terminator. Ligation products were transformed into ccdB resistant E. coli cells (One shot ccdB survivalTM, Invitrogen). The pAG vectors contain an ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli, one of four different auxotrophic selection markers (HIS3, LEU2, TRP1, and URA3) and one of three different replication determinants (2 \u03bc ori, CEN, or Integrating) thus giving rise to a MultiSite GatewayTM vector set (Figure 1C) for expression in S. cerevisiae (see Table 1 for nomenclature).

For proof-of-concept, we cloned different plant genes (without STOP codon) in a C-terminal translational fusion with either a V5, c-myc, or FLAG-HIS tag. To make these constructs compatible with protein interaction studies in yeast, we additionally fused each epitope tag with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) derived from SV40, thereby creating the NLS-3xV5, NLS-3xc-myc, and NLS-3xFLAG-6xHIS tags, respectively. Such constructs allow avoiding false negative experimental outcomes that result from protein localisation in different cellular compartments, for instance. Tagged plant proteins were expressed in yeast under the control of the constitutive GPD or ADH1 promoters in different vectors from our set. Total protein extracts were obtained and the expressed proteins were visualized through immunoblot analysis (Figure 3B). The (NLS)FLAG-HIS tag is particularly suitable when protein purification under denaturing conditions is needed, while, at the same time, low background detection on immunoblots is desired.",

Organisms for which ORFeome collections contain vectors that match these criteria include several bacterial collections (Brucella melitensis[12], Pseudomonas aeruginosa[13], Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae[14]), human and mouse [15], plants (Arabidopsis [16], maize, sorghum, sugarcane, rice [17]), viruses [18] and yeasts (S. cerevisiae[19] and Schizosaccharomyces pombe[20]). Caution is advised since some ORFeome collections contain entry clones both with and without stop codon [15,16]. ORFeome collections that comprise only GOI\u2019s provided with a stop codon, as is the case for some bacterial and viral ORFeomes (Neisseria gonorrhoeae[21], Sinorhizobium meliloti[22], Yersinia pestis[14], and Hepatitis C [23]) are not compatible with our vectors. Other ORFeomes in which the GOI is cloned without a start and without a stop codon (Caenorhabditis elegans[24,25], E. coli[26]), are not compatible with our current promoters but can be used for expression of C-terminal translational fusions with our vectors provided the promoter is cloned followed by a start codon. Since this ORFeome list is non-exhaustive and, as described above, different approaches are used when cloning the GOI, the compatibility of available pENTR collections should always be corroborated either in silico before assembling the different sequences into expression vectors or through epitope tag detection in immunoblots. Finally, the destination vector set presented here also allows expression of N-terminal fusions, provided the att sites flanking the different fusion components are adapted accordingly.",

We have proposed recently that the adaptor protein NINJA bridges the JAZ proteins to TPL proteins and thereby forms a repressor complex that blocks the cellular programs regulated by the jasmonates, ubiquitous plant hormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth, development, and survival [33]. TPL interacts with the ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR\u2013associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif that is present in NINJA [33] but absent in most JAZ proteins, including JAZ3. Some JAZ proteins however, i.e. JAZ5 to JAZ8, contain EAR motifs themselves and are capable of direct interaction with TPL [34-36].",

To verify whether NINJA can connect EAR-lacking JAZs with TPL, as previously proposed [33], we performed a Y3H assay in which we expressed NINJA, under control of a constitutive promoter (pGPD), as a bridging protein. Hereby we used the MultiSite GatewayTM vector pMG426 (Table 1) that carries the URA3 auxotrophic marker that is often still available in yeast strains used for Y2H. As a C-terminal tag we used the NLS-FLAG-HIS tag.

Attachment of attB sites to a DNA segment of choice, often generated by PCR or as synthetic DNA, allows recognition by the BP ClonaseTM and recombination into a donor vector (pDONR) containing attP sites, yielding an entry clone (pENTR) carrying attL sites. The DNA segment in the pENTR clone can then be transferred to a destination vector (pDEST) by recombination between attL and attR sites present on the pDEST vector mediated by the LR ClonaseTM. This yields an expression clone (pEXP) in which the DNA segment again becomes flanked by attB sites. Positive selection of pENTR and pEXP clones on medium containing appropriate antibiotics together with negative selection of starting products and by-products (shown in grey) based on the presence of a negative (ccdB) selection marker between the recombination sites (GatewayTM Cassette) further increases the efficiency of the system. (B) A combination of existing pENTRs, or new pENTRs, are easily assembled in a single MultiSite GatewayTM reaction catalyzed by the LR II ClonaseTM Plus using pMG as destination vector. (C) Schematic representation of the MultiSite GatewayTM compatible vector set (pMG) for transformation of S. cerevisiae. GOI, POI and TOI indicate gene, promoter and tag of interest, respectively. CmR, AmpR and KmR indicate chloramphenicol, ampicillin and kanamycin resistance, respectively. B1-B4, P1-P2, L1-L4 and R1-R4 stand for the respective att sites.

Many of such sequences, including whole ORFeomes (cloned without STOP codon) of several model organisms [16-19] and a broad range of tags [5,9-11] are already available in suitable pDONR vectors. L1-L4 and R1-R2 stand for the att sites attL1attL4 and attR1attR2, respectively.

After total protein extraction, expression was verified in inducing (+) and non-inducing (\u2212) medium through immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibodies.

Yeasts were transformed with pMG425-ADH1::JAZ12:\u2212NLS-FLAG-HIS, pMG423-GPD::COI1-C:\u2212NLS-V5 where COI1-C is a truncated version of COI1, or pMG423-GPD::At2g26000: NLS-c-myc. Expression of the different constructs was verified with immunoblot analysis of total protein extracts with anti-FLAG, anti-V5 and anti-c-myc antibodies, respectively.
