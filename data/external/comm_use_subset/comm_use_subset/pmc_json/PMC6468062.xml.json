As a result, prevalence estimates of different viruses are skewed toward the most pathogenic agents, and overall infection rates are likely underestimated. Here, we supplement traditional surveillance through sampling among healthy individuals who are tested weekly for multiple respiratory viruses irrespective of whether they are experiencing respiratory symptoms. We use this information to quantify the prevalence of common respiratory viruses within the general population, characterize the seasonality of these viruses, and assess the risk factors (age, habits, and health conditions) that increase susceptibility among hosts.",

The study period spanned two years between October 2016 and April 2018 with some individuals enrolled for a single cold and flu season (October\u2010April) and others for the entire period. At enrollment, individuals were asked to complete a baseline survey and provide two nasopharyngeal swab samples (one for each nostril). Following this preliminary step, two nasopharyngeal samples were collected weekly from each participant irrespective of symptoms. The baseline questionnaire completed at the time of enrollment included information on ethnicity, general health, daily habits, travel history, and household structure. Parents provided consent and questionnaire answers for children enrolled. Details on the participants are summarized in Table 1.",

Here, we have shown that respiratory virus infections are present among all age groups, with almost all participants presenting with at least one viral infection per year and an overall rate of 17.5% of positivity among all collected samples. Infection appeared to be strongly connected with age, with young children presenting more than double the number of infections of other age groups. Adults with daily contact with children (parents and pediatric doctors) also had a higher number of infections than their counterparts without daily contact with children. Moreover, the distribution of respiratory virus infections for parents and pediatric doctors was very similar to the distribution observed in the children. These observations suggest children are a principal source of respiratory infection and confirm earlier studies that found day cares to be optimal environments for transmission.12, 13 Self\u2010identification with American Indian or Alaskan native race was also a factor influencing the number of respiratory viral infections. This association was likely due to the non\u2010mixed nature of our population, as nearly all of the participants self\u2010identifying as Alaskan native or American Indian were children or parents from one of the day care settings.

The spikes in prevalence of coronavirus in May and July are likely artifacts due to the lower numbers of samples collected",
