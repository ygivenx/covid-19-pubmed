The pAJ-DPP4 plasmid expressing the DPP4 coding sequence of Jamaican fruit bat under control of a CMV promoter was transfected into BHK cells, which are not permissive to MERS-CoV34. The expression of AJ-DPP4 in transfected cells was confirmed by flow cytometry, showing the presence of bat DPP4 on the surface of transfected BHK cells by determining the increase over untransfected cells (Figure S1). Transient expression of bat DPP4 in BHK cells supported MERS-CoV replication, whereas transient expression of hamster DPP4 in BHK cells did not (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, the replication kinetics of MERS-CoV were compared in LLC-MK2 cells (Macaca mulatta) and Jamaican fruit bat primary kidney cells. MERS-CoV replicated efficiently to high titers in both cell lines (Fig. 1B), indicating that there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV replication in Jamaican fruit bat cells.",

A wide variety of alpha- and betacoronaviruses have been detected in Artibeus spp. bats in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama and Trinidad & Tobago7134344. The wide diversity of coronaviruses detected in bats, combined with their ability to support efficient replication of MERS-CoV, the availability of an annotated transcriptome45, and the relative easy housing and husbandry practices of Jamaican fruit bats suggest that this bat species can become an important model system to investigate the relationship between coronaviruses and their bat hosts46. Although the Jamaican fruit bat is not the direct ancestral reservoir for MERS-CoV, as it is a new world bat species, generalized responses towards viruses of bat-origin rather than a direct host-pathogen relationships can be modelled.",

With batCoV-HKU4, a closely related coronavirus, it was shown that replication in human cells required two mutations in the spike protein48. These amino acid residues, which are conserved in MERS-CoV, results in the activation of the batCoV-HKU4 spike protein by human cellular proteases. This suggests that batCoV-HKU4 needs these residues for replication in humans. Interestingly, our data show that MERS-CoV replicates efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting that the MERS-CoV spike can efficiently be processed by Jamaican fruit bat cellular proteases and that there is no host restriction on the post-translational modification level of the MERS-CoV spike in dromedary camels, humans and bats.",

MERS-CoV and related batCoV-HKU4 can inhibit innate immune signaling in a variety of human cell lines in vitro via the ORF4b-encoded accessory proteins52. The ability of MERS-CoV and batCoV-HKU4 to evade this innate immune sensing must have evolved in the reservoir bat host, and may therefore have benefitted the virus by limiting the bat immune response without negatively impacting the population level of the bat host. The modest, transient upregulation of Mx1, ISG56 and RANTES observed in Jamaican fruit bats may permit MERS-CoV replication without causing clinical signs. The transient nature of the MERS-CoV infection suggests that the virus is cleared by immune mechanisms, but the isolation of MERS-CoV in the duodenum of bat 10 at 28 dpi indicates that the virus might persist at low levels for a longer period of time. The limited seroconversion observed in the Jamaican fruit bats suggest that the immunogenicity of the MERS-CoV proteins in the context of experimental infection in bats in absence of clinical signs is very low. In humans seroconversion was observed in clinically ill patients between 21 and 28 days after infection with MERS-CoV with titers between 80 and 32053. Limited seroprevalance was observed in healthy people with a high occupational risk for MERS-CoV exposure (shepherds and slaughterhouse workers), combined with the extensive circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels this suggests that unrecognized infections that cause no or mild symptoms might result in no to limited seroconversion2254.",

Experimental bat infection studies have been performed with coronavirus bat intestine samples derived from field studies18, Nipah virus and Hendra virus5556, Tacaribe virus57, Ebola virus and Marburg virus5859 and the majority of experimental infection studies have been performed with Lyssaviruses60. In these studies replication, shedding, morbidity and mortality varied greatly. Severe morbidity and mortality were observed after inoculation of Jamaican fruit bats with Tacaribe virus and rabies virus5761; Jamaican fruit bats are the presumed host reservoir for both viruses. After oral inoculation of Leschenault\u2019s Rousette bats (Rousettus leschenaulti) with homogenates of intestinal tract samples obtained from bats caught during field studies in the Philippines and positive by PCR for a group 2 Betacoronavirus (closely related to MERS-CoV) no clinical signs were observed, but replication and limited virus shedding were observed in and from the intestinal tract18. Our experimental infection data show that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to efficiently replicate in a bat host. In our bat infection model all Jamaican fruit bats became infected with MERS-CoV in the absence of clinical signs. This supports the hypothesis that bats are the ancestral reservoir for MERS-CoV. In addition, it highlights the host-range plasticity of MERS-CoV, and potentially of those of highly related coronaviruses circulating in bat population.",

Mock inoculated bats were inoculated with standard tissue culture media via the same routes and volumes. Bats were injected with an IPTT-300 temperature transponder (BMDS) to monitor body temperature daily. Animals were weighed daily and observed for signs of disease. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were obtained on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11 dpi and analyzed for the presence of viral RNA. On 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days post inoculation (dpi), two bats were euthanized and trachea, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, duodenum, colon, bladder, nasal turbinates and brain were collected for virological and histopathological analysis.",
