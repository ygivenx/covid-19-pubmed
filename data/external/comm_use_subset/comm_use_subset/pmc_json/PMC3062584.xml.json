Therefore, new innovative therapies are urgently required in order to combat the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancers. Antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers since it has the ability to specifically eradicate systemic tumors and control metastases without damaging normal cells. DNA vaccination has become a potentially promising approach for antigen-specific immunotherapy due to its safety, stability and ease of preparation (for review, see [1,2]). We have previously developed several innovative strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency by directly targeting the DNA into the dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo via gene gun as well as by modifying the properties of antigen-expressing DCs (for review see [3,4]).",

Previously, we have studied the linkage of calreticulin (CRT), a Ca2+-binding protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (for review, see [5]) to several antigens, including human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 [6,7], E6 [8], and nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [9]. Intradermal administration of CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and impressive antitumor effects. Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models.",

DMXAA has been shown to induce antitumor effects in animal models, especially in combination with established anticancer agents.

We also characterized the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in these mice. One week after DMXAA treatment, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. However, as shown in Figure 1B, we found that mice treated with DMXAA were not capable of significantly enhancing the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to mice without DMXAA treatment.

C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were treated with DMXAA at 20 mg/kg via i.p. injection. 48 hours later, splenocytes were harvested and apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were analyzed by annexin V staining. There was no significant difference in the levels of apoptotic cell death in the CD4+ or CD8+ T cells among splenocytes from mice treated with DMXAA compared to those from the control mice (see Additional File 3; Figure S3).

Thus, in order to further explore the mechanism of action of DMXAA related to iNOS and TNF\u03b1, we have used iNOS-/- mice or TNF\u03b1-/- mice as well as C57BL/6 WT mice (5 per group) for our study. These mice were vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA either at the time of first vaccination on D0 or 3 days after the first vaccination on D3 as indicated in Figure 8A and 8D. One week after last vaccination, splenocytes from vaccinated mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 8B, while DMXAA led to the suppression of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in CRT/E7 vaccinated WT mice when administered on D0, DMXAA did not suppress the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in CRT/E7 vaccinated iNOS-/- mice. This indicates that iNOS is a major factor in the immunosuppression mediated by DMXAA when administered at the time of the first DNA vaccination. On the other hand, vaccinated TNF\u03b1-/- mice treated with DMXAA administered on D0 suppressed the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses similar to wild-type mice (see Figure 8C). We also found that vaccinated iNOS-/- mice or TNF\u03b1-/- mice treated with DMXAA on D3 led to enhancement E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses similar to wild-type mice (Figure 8E and 8F). Thus, our data indicate that iNOS, but not TNF\u03b1 contribute to the observed immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration at the time of the first DNA vaccination.",

The release of tumor antigen caused by DMXAA treatment may not be sufficient to generate detectable antigen-specific immune responses. Thus, while DMXAA treatment alone in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice failed to lead to appreciable E7 antigen-specific immune responses, the vaccination with CRT/E7 vaccine can lead to increased number of E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors in tumor-bearing mice, which may be further expanded by treatment with DMXAA, resulting in a significant enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ immune responses in treated mice (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Our study explored the mechanism of enhancement induced by DMXAA. We found that DMXAA administered after the first DNA vaccination influences the cytokine profile in the serum of mice with observed immune enhancement (Figure 7). Mice treated with DMXAAA after the first DNA vaccination showed upregulation of the cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES. IL-6 can be secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune response to trauma, leading to inflammation (for review see [21]). G-CSF is a cytokine produced by a number of different tissues to stimulate the bone marrow to produce granulocytes and stem cells. KC, MIP-1\u03b2 and RANTES are chemokines that act as chemo-attractants to guide the migration of T cells. All these molecules are believed to play a role in the immune enhancement generated by DMXAA administration. In additon, our data suggest that treatment with DMXAA 3 days after the first DNA vaccination can lead to enhancement of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells (Figure 5). Thus, it is possible that the enhancement of E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses by DMXAA treatment may also be contributed by both cytokines as well as antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.",

Our study also showed that the immune suppression mediated by DMXAA is abolished in iNOS knockout mice. Because DCs are essential for priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune response, it is conceivable that treatment with DMXAA may lead to the negative impact on DC function, presumably mediated by iNOS. It will be of interest to further characterize the role of iNOS on immunosuppression mediated by DMXAA treatment.",
