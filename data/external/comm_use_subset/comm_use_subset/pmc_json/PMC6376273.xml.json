The cornerstones of innate immunity are the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which detect pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) during infection. PAMPs are key molecular features shared by classes of pathogens that are usually absent from healthy cells, and include, for instance, bacterial or fungal cell wall components, or viral nucleic acids that would not usually be found in the host cell. PAMPs can be recognized in trans when phagocytes detect engulfed pathogens or debris from infected cells via Toll\u2010like receptors on their cell surface or inside endosomes. In addition, many cell types can also recognize when they have been infected themselves by an intracellular pathogen using intracellular PRRs that constantly survey the cell's contents for signs of infection. Intracellular PRRs raise the alarm either after sensing the presence of PAMPs directly, or after detecting the indirect effects of infection or tissue damage as danger\u2010associated molecular patterns.1\n",

The rapidly inducible transcriptional programme is a key factor in the early elimination of pathogens and for the initiation of appropriate local immune responses that ultimately determine the outcome of an infection. For this reason, it can be assumed that all pathogens need to evade or subvert the host's innate immune responses to be able to establish an infection. Here, we will describe the strategies that intracellular pathogens use to hide from the cell's nucleic acid receptors, and to disable or subvert their function. Ultimately, the activation of signalling cascades by nucleic acid sensors and many other PRRs converges on the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Many pathogens also block innate immune responses at the level of these downstream signalling nodes, or by inhibiting the function of interferons and cytokines after they have been secreted, and we refer the reader to further reviews on this topic.2, 3, 4\n",

The nuclear DNA viruses hCMV, HSV\u20101 and Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus all target several key DNA sensing factors to prevent the detection of their genomic DNA. HSV\u20101 uses its ICP27 protein to inhibit STING.133 In addition, the E3 ubiquitin ligase ICP0 causes the degradation of IFI16 protein, and the virion host shutoff protein UL41 promotes the turnover of the mRNAs encoding IFI16 and cGAS.42, 134, 135 In addition, the HSV\u20101 virion protein VP22 interacts with cGAS and inhibits its enzymatic activity136 and also interacts with AIM2 and blocks its oligomerization.137 HSV\u20101 tegument protein UL37, which targets and deamidates RIG\u2010I, also deamidates cGAS, impairing cGAMP synthesis.138 The deployment of different virulence factors to target several components of the DNA sensing pathway may be necessary to block the pathway more efficiently, and/or to inhibit some non\u2010overlapping functions of cGAS and IFI16 which have been observed during herpesvirus infection.139 Analogously, several different hCMV proteins inhibit DNA sensing: pUL31 binds to cGAS and dissociates it from DNA,140 pUL83 inhibits both cGAS and IFI16,141, 142, 143 pUL82 inhibits STING translocation,144 IE2 causes STING degradation,145 and US9 inactivates both MAVS and STING.125 Furthermore, pUL83 binds AIM2 and facilitates the degradation of AIM2\u2010driven inflammasomes.146 A similar multi\u2010pronged approach has also been observed for the gammaherpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma\u2010associated herpesvirus.147, 148, 149, 150 STING is also inhibited by oncoproteins from the nuclear DNA viruses human adenovirus and human papillomavirus,151 and by vaccinia virus, a DNA virus that resides in the cytosol.152 Vaccinia virus also inhibits DNA\u2010PK, using its virulence factor C16 to bind the Ku70/Ku80 subunits of the DNA\u2010PK complex.153 The viral inhibitor of RIP activation (vIRA) from mouse CMV targets another proposed DNA sensor, DAI, to prevent the induction of programmed necrosis upon viral infection.154\n",

As in so many fields in biology, much can be learnt from insights into the host\u2013pathogen interactions that interfere with our cells' defences. Immunomodulatory proteins from pathogens can point us to their targets, which are often key signalling nodes that play a role during infection. Although immune evasion has long been studied in human cells and mouse models, the investigation of innate immune signalling in reservoir hosts such as bats or birds, is an emerging field of research. The variation of these interactions during pathogen evolution often underlies the ability of pathogens to cross species boundaries or to adopt new traits in transmission or virulence during emerging infections. Knowing more about the functions of individual immunomodulatory proteins is also crucial for the rational development of vaccine vectors, as for instance the removal of individual immune evasion factors can aid safety and immunogenicity of a live vaccine. It is becoming increasingly clear that nucleic acid PAMPs and their PRRs also perform key roles during sterile inflammation, autoimmunity and even cancer treatment, so the lessons we learn from our pathogens may ultimately have applications for the treatment and prevention of both infectious and non\u2010infectious diseases that involve the immune system.",
