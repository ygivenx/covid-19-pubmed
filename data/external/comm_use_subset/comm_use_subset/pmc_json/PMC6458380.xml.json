            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and is a severe respiratory disease that causes fever, cough and respiratory disturbance, as in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1,2]. The reported cases of MERS infection increased in the Middle East in May 2014, and since then, there has been a growing concern about MERS infection [3]. In May 2015, the first case of MERS infection was reported in Korea; the patient had contracted the disease while visiting the Arabian Peninsula and had returned to Korea, thereby spreading MERS in Korea [4]. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the region with the highest number of infected cases outside the Arabian Peninsula is Korea [5]. MERS spread in Korea from May 2015 to July 2015; in less than two months, 186 people were infected and 38 people died. The Korea CDC reported that MERS rapidly spread over a short period because of hospital infection. According to epidemiological findings, 87.6% of the infected patients were infected in the hospital [6]. Similarly, in the MERS cases reported in Jeddah in 2014, infection was found to spread in the hospital through super-spreading events [7]. The MERS events in Korea and Jeddah indicate that MERS infection can gradually increase when a dense population is confined to relatively small spaces such as hospitals.",

In addition to the index patient, 30 people (15 inpatients, 13 family members and 2 nurses) were infected on the eighth floor of the hospital [9]. To confirm the cause of the infection of secondary patients at the hospital, an epidemiological investigation of the infection transmission route was conducted. The investigation results showed that 23% of the infected patients did not come in close contact with other infected patients [10]. Similar to SARS, MERS is known to be an infection caused by close contact [11]. However, the infection of a secondary patient with no close contact with the index patient does not support the claim that MERS is spread only through close contact. Therefore, the possibility of other infection transmission routes of MERS, such as air transmission, is being studied [12,13]. In the case of SARS, the airflow in the Prince of Wales Hospital was analysed, where the first SARS-infected patient was hospitalized. The results showed that the pattern of the infection of the secondary patient was similar to the indoor airflow pattern [14]. When SARS was reported in Toronto, Canada, a field experiment was performed to determine the infection transmission route, and the results indicated that SARS could possibly be an opportunistic airborne infection [15]. A new risk calculation method was applied to confirm the spatial risk distribution of SARS, and the results showed that SARS was more likely to be transmitted through the air [16].",

However, the index patient was admitted to a ward with no supply and exhaust vent. The ward was originally a seven-person ward and was separated into two two-person wards. In the process of separating the wards, vents were installed in only one of the wards. Because of this construction lapse, the index patient's ward was not mechanically ventilated, and only natural ventilation was provided through the window. It is possible that the droplets produced by coughing and sneezing by the index patient accumulated in the ward at a high concentration due to lack of ventilation. MERS bacteria are known to survive for up to 72 h on plastic or steel surfaces at a room temperature of 20\u00b0C and a humidity of 40% [18], and droplets are known to shrink their size during the evaporation process [19,20]. A person who infects more than five people is called a super-spreader, and the index patient was also surveyed as a super-spreader [21]. The results of previous studies indicate that the droplets from the index patient, who was a super-spreader, can partially evaporate and become small particles such as droplet nuclei and then spread to the adjacent wards through airflow [14,22,23].",

The analytical mesh was a trimmer mesh, and the prism layer mesh was applied to the wall. Mesh independence test was performed and compared with coarse (3 million), medium (6 million) and fine mesh size (9 million) for prediction accuracy of the CFD simulation results [28]. Outdoor velocity data were extracted at the front of the hospital (figure 4a) at constant height of 1 m and indoor velocity data were extracted from window height (figure 4b). Realizable k\u2013\u025b turbulence model [29,30] was used as the turbulence model. As a boundary condition, the airflow was set in the windward direction according to the wind speed profile and it was set to escape to the leeward direction due to pressure formation [31]. The side and top parts of the domain were set to be symmetrical. Figure 5 shows the wind speed and direction when the index patient was hospitalized, i.e. from noon on 15 May 2015 to the morning of 17 May 2015. Wind data at the height of 10 m were obtained from the nearest weather observatory located 3.6 km away from the hospital. The CFD cases were selected according to the dominant wind directions, i.e. west, west-southwest winds.

Comparing with case W-1T, which is non-isothermal simulation, concentration difference of ward 8014 was not significant. However, wards 8111 and 8112 showed 3.64 and 2.47% lower concentration. This is due to buoyancy effect which forms upper air movement; the concentration is extracted at the occupied zone (0\u20131.8 m). In case WSW-1, the highest concentration was observed in ward 8109; 3.69% where most of infected cases were reported. In cases W-2 and WSW-2, where all ventilation system was not in operation, higher passive tracer concentration was observed in every contaminant-detected ward compared with other cases.

In case W-3, the reduction rate of the concentration in ward 8104 was relatively low compared to case WSW-3.

In case WSW, most of the air flowed through the side opening of the awning window to ward 8104; therefore, the air from outside did not disturb the airflow from the supply vent and more volume of air was passing through the windows compared to case W. In case W, air mostly flowed through the under part of the awning window and less air volume of air was passing through the window due to window shape and disturbed air flow from the supply vent.",

The wind speed profile was obtained and analysed based on the average wind speed values of the west, west-southwest and east winds, which were the dominant wind directions during the period in which the index patient was hospitalized. On the first day of hospitalization of the index patient (15 May 2015), the wind was mainly blowing from the west-southwest as shown in figure 11a, except from 22.00 to 22.30. In the first day, the wind was relatively weak, with a maximum wind speed of 3.4 m s\u22121 and an average wind speed of 1.7 m s\u22121. As shown in figure 11b, on 16 May, east winds were blowing from 5.00 to 7.30, and there was a possibility that the passive tracer that spread because of the west-southwest wind might re-spread to the west-facing wards because of the east wind. As shown in figure 11a\u2032, winds were continually blowing from the west southwest and west until 20.00; maximum wind speed was 5.5 m s\u22121, and the average wind speed was 2.2 m s\u22121. As shown in figure 11b\u2032, on the following day (16 May), the west and east winds randomly blew from 21.00 to 3.00. East wind blew with an average wind speed of 1.2 m s\u22121 and a maximum wind speed of 2.1 m s\u22121. The passive tracer that spread because of the west-southwest wind on the previous day could have re-spread to the other wards before the patient was discharged.\n",
