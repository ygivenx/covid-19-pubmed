Air pollution caused by ambient PM is a growing problem not only in developing countries but also in the developed world and has resulted in severe hazards for public health (1). Numerous epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to respirable PM is critical in the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma as well as it is strongly associated with cardiopulmonary mortality and morbidity in exposed populations, especially in susceptible ones (2). According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, particle pollution includes inhalable coarse particles between 10 and 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM10) and fine particles less than 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5). Numerous studies have suggested that fine particles (PM2.5) are more closely associated with both acute and chronic respiratory effects, as well as subsequent mortality, than coarse particles (PM10) due to their smaller size, larger surface area, deeper airway penetration, and greater ability to be retained in the lungs (3). Although epidemiological reports on adverse health effects are mostly consistent in their views on PM exposure, only a few pay attention to the source and composition of particles that might be responsible for those adverse effects (4). At the same time, the exact constituents of airborne PM that cause airway inflammatory response and their precise mechanisms have yet to be thoroughly investigated (5, 6).",

To meet those dietary demands, live bird markets (LBMs) have been established in nearly all cities in China, mostly in densely populated areas. The airborne elements of LBMs contain several harmful biological components (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and influenza virus), and in recent years, the emergence of various highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (AIVs), including H5N1 (7), H7N9 (8), and H10N8 (9), in China has presented a serious threat to people\u2019s health. It has been reported that these highly pathogenic AIVs can be isolated from LBMs (8, 10\u201312), and that LBMs are potential hubs for the transmission of AIVs, which can survive there for prolonged periods (13). As early emergency investigations have also shown, LBMs are likely to play an important role in disease transmission (14), which suggests that exposure to airborne PM of LBMs can pose health risks, especially for children, the elderly, and live poultry-slaughtering workers.",

Also known to induce adaptive immune response via the recognition of various microbial components (24), TLRs can furthermore cause lung injury by eliciting the expression of inflammatory mediators (e.g., specific pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines) and by increasing the aggregation of inflammatory cells (25). Each TLR family detects different microbial pathogen-associated molecular pattern and triggers the activation of specific signaling pathways, thereby prompting the transcription of cytokines and chemokines (26). For example, TLR2 primarily recognizes lipoproteins, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycan from Gram-positive bacteria (27). TLR3 engages in recognizing double-stranded RNA, polyriboinosinic\u2013polyribocytidylic acid, and poly (I:C) (28), whereas TLR4 engages in recognizing lipopolysaccharides, the primary component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (29). Single-stranded RNA is recognized by TLR7 and TLR8, whereas TLR9 is engaged in recognizing unmethylated bacterial CpG DNA motifs (26).",

(24) indicated that microbial materials adsorbed on the dust can aggravate the degree of lung injury. In our research, endotoxin levels of PM2.5 and PM10 were also detected using LAL assay. It is well recognized that endotoxin is associated with a constituent of the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and is a known trigger of airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms. Some studies with animal models suggest that exposure to endotoxin can result in the activation of TLR4 signaling pathways (32), a result that also reflects the importance of biological components of PM. A significant increase in the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 proteins was moreover observed in the acute phase model. In previous research on smoke-induced changes in cytokines and chemokines, Kubo et al. (33) found that a single instance of cigarette smoke exposure can lead to significant increases in the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MCP-1. Taken together, both studies indicate that the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MCP-1 can be upregulated in acute lung injury in both mice and guinea pigs. The expression levels of cytokines and chemokines in the PM10+-treated and PM2.5+-treated groups were significantly greater than in the PM10\u2212-treated and PM2.5\u2212-treated ones (p < 0.05). Furthermore, expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 in the PM10+-treated group were slightly greater than in the PM2.5+-treated group. The most likely explanation for that phenomenon is that the biological components are primarily associated with PM10 versus fine and ultrafine PM.",
