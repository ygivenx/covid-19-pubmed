We define such comparisons as the systematic comparative genomics. We believe it should be a priority task to carry out whole-genome-wide comparative genomics at large scale based on the geometrical analysis of sequences crossing diverse genetic components and biological categories in the post-genomic era. However, even simply visualizing a DNA sequence has been challenging for decades; little progress has been made to date [1].",

The output dataset is only used for visualization through graphical techniques [1]. The most common tools were BLAST [9] and CLUSTALW [10]. Recently, a BLAST-based tool, BRIG, was constructed for genome-wide comparison to create images of multiple circular genomes among a number of very closely related bacteria strains [11]. The output image showed the BLAST-similarity between one central reference sequence and other inquiry sequences as a set of concentric rings, in which BLAST-matches were colored on a sliding scale indicating a defined percentage of BLAST-identity. This tool had great advantages over other common tools, like ACT [12], in terms of the numbers of genomes being simultaneously compared and the ways of presenting its output images. These features made it a versatile tool for visualizing a range of genome data, but it was still only for visualization. Similarly, the Mauve program [14], [15], combining both algebraic calculation and graphic display, was widely used for comparing and visualizing a set of genomes. However, even within close relatives, the number of genomes being handled by Mauve was dramatically dependent on the computational constraints, taking up too much CPU time or causing memory overflow, which limited Mauve to handle few very close relatives at one time.",

Most importantly, both calculation and visualization are separately processed in a dynamic way so that the input and output can be subsequently re-useable for geometrical analysis. One promising example was the Z-curve method (Zplotter program), which generated a set of three-dimensional coordinates from a linear genome sequence [16]. Such coordinates were plotted to create three-dimensional geometrical visions (as open rough Z-curves) for the given DNA sequences [16]. Hundreds of such visions for microbial genomes were collected as a database [17]. The Z-curve method (Zplotter program) was used not only for visualization but for geometrical analysis to explore the real contexts of biology [18], [19], [20], [21]. For example, two replication ori points in archaeal bacterial genomes were predicted by the Z-curve analysis [22], [23] and confirmed by the wet experiments in other labs [24], [25], thus showing it\u2019s promising. However, the Zplotter algorithm had an inevitable flaw to falsely present a genome sequence due to its ambiguous cutting-point error (see Discussion section), which was not be suitable for creating a stable unique genome fingerprint, as we proposed; nonetheless, no statistic analysis could be further applied to the outcome dataset.",

We further develop a set of concepts and tools, and thereby establish a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA). Finally, we construct a method to quantitatively analyze the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the applications of such methods through various case studies, giving new insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy. These have set up the methodology of what we called the systematic comparative genomics based on the genome fingerprint and the universal genome fingerprint analysis. We anticipate that these comprehensive methods can be widely applied at large scale in the post-genomic era.",

For instance, we make up a large set (over one hundred) of genomes of interest by combing 6 archaeal bacterial genomes and 13 archaeal bacterial plasmids (shown in Figure 6), 12 fragmental chromosomes of E.coli (shown in Figure 4), 47 phage genomes and 24 virus genomes (as listed in Table 2) to be compared at large scale by using the UGFM-TGCC-SCG tool. Remind that the effects of scale-down and view-angle rotation as demonstrated earlier (Figure 4) could ensure that as many sequences as possible could be handled at one time as long as the computer memory and the graphic software could allot. Under our conditions (physical 2-Gb memory and 32-bits graphic software), we can only handle up to 1.5 Gb data in-one-sitting. As such, we generate two sets, separately. One set contains eighty three genomes: 24 viruses (I), 12 fragmental chromosomes of E.coli (II), and 47 phages (III), which are shown as three distinct groups (Figure 7, A). The other set consists of two archaeal bacterial chromosomes (I), two bacterial fragmental chromosomes/two phages/two viruses (II), and three plasmids (III), which are shown as three distinct groups (Figure 7, B). These are generally consistent with their real biological distinctions at different taxonomical levels. Obviously, here the effects of scale-down and view-angle rotation are demonstrated even stronger than those in earlier sections. Moreover, in the big group of phages and viruses (II), most genomes seem as very close relatives and accordingly almost repeat themselves within the phage or virus subgroup, respectively, resulting in fewer maps than should be.",

Namely, these data are more than enough to prove the concepts and tools (UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG) (Figure 5) effective and powerful in handling such real-world diverse genomes in-one-sitting. Most importantly, the representatives are elegantly plotted as beautiful and meaningful UGFM-TGCC-SCG visions (Figure 6, 7), explicitly demonstrating the scope and power of the unique comprehensive methods developed in the present study. Remarkably, we re-emphasize that the combined concept and tool of \u201cUGFM-TGCC-SCG\u201d, namely the \u201cuniversal genome fingerprint map (UGFM)\u201d of \u201ctotal genetic component configuration (TGCC)\u201d based \u201csystematic comparative genomics (SCG)\u201d, is distinguished from any other traditional methods of comparative genomics. This is simply because all genomes of interest crossing diverse genetic components (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages, if applicable) and diverse biological categories (bacteria, archaeal bacteria, viruses) are much less or even no homology at all (Figure 6, 7), which should be incredibly challenging to any conventional methods based on the traditional homology analysis. In fact, all documented researches so far about comparative genomics were automatically based on the assumption that there should be at least one reference for those very close relatives in question; otherwise, they would not bother to do comparison. However, in our case, we focus exactly on the opposites: much less or even no homology at all. We have demonstrated the successful usage of the UGFM-TGCC-SCG tool (Figure 6, 7) in comparing such diverse genetic components and diverse biological categories, regardless of the format of objects and the extent of divergences. Clearly, this is one of the core concepts and the most priority aim in the present study.",

First, within the same one strain, there are two chromosomes; and the differentiate rate between the two chromosomes is at least close to the values between two species or genera, implying that such two chromosomes are divergent and each independently impacts on the same strain. For instance, the differentiate rates of Halorubrum lacusprofundii 49239 vs. 49239-II (42.39%) and Haloarcula marismortui 43049 vs. 43049-II (30.68%), respectively, are close to certain values of the differentiate rates (e.g., 42.76%, 36.36%, 54.44%) at genus level within the same family Halobacteriaceae. Second, within the same species, Escherichia coli, three strains (BL21(DE3), CB9615, CFT073) are extraordinary because the differentiate rate between UT189 and BL21(DE3) is 321.11%, which is extremely out of the ranges (3.36%\u223c36.42%) defined by the ordinary members in the same species; and it is even much greater than the value of 25.10% between two external genera (Methanococcus voltae A3 and Methanosphaera stadtmanae 3091) in other family. Third, within the same family, Halobacteriaceae, the differentiate rates among different genera vary between 17.10% and 291.91%. Putting together, these data probably indicate that such strains (particularly containing more than one chromosome) have been continuously growing and absorbing new composites so that they are potentially developing into a new species. Moreover, from family to family, the genus levels are not within the same range of divergence in terms of the differentiate rates, implying no possibility of setting up a universal boundary for simply distinguishing all taxa.",

In fact, although some coordinates from the Zplotter program were used to produce hundreds of graphs (as open rough Z-curves) of microbial genomes that were documented as a database [17], there were no stable unique features in terms of the so-called genome fingerprints. For example, when we re-plotted the visions of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 genome sequence (NC_002607) using the Zplotter\u2019s coordinates of either zn' or zn, respectively, to present an open rough Z-curve (data not shown), those visions themselves were quite different from one another due to the wavelet transform in the algorithm of Zplotter program [16]. In contrast, our method presented a unique circular vision with accurate and delicate genome fingerprints for the same sequence (data not shown). Again, note that using the zn, coordinates gave a similar vision to ours, except that it was in an open rough Z-curve with less features; while using the zn' coordinates created a completely different vision from ours (data not shown). We conclude that our GenomeFingerprinter method provides more accurate and delicate coordinates than the Zplotter program does, and therefore is valid for the subsequent applications that have been established by the Z-curve analysis. Of course, one should beware of choosing whether zn from our method or zn' from the Zplotter program when referring to specific questions.",

            "text": "We found a major problem when using the Zplotter program to handle circular genome sequences with cutting-point errors. In fact, for example, the same circular sequence of Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 (NC_002607) but with two different cutting-points (e.g., NC_002607_RC was re-cut at 700 kbps) were incorrectly presented as different visions by using the Zplotter\u2019s coordinates; whereas both scenarios were exactly shown as the same vision by using our method (data not shown). The reasons for such differences come from that the Zplotter program was designed for a linear sequence [16] and its algorithm depends on counting the absolute numbers of bases starting from the \u201cfirst\u201d base in a given linear sequence. Meanwhile, when a sequence was deposited as a linear form (regardless of the original linear or circular form), the documented first base was usually not guaranteed to be the real first one. Taken together, the same circular sequence with cutting-point error changing its real \u201cfirst\u201d base can result in a quite different vision by using the Zplotter program. In contrast, our method was initially created for a circular sequence (Figure 1) but has been proved also valid for a linear one as exemplified earlier. This is not only because the linear form is a specific form of circular one, but also because the formula (1) described earlier ensures that our method measures the relative distance in a circular form, rather than the absolute numbers of bases counting from the \u201cfirst\u201d base in a linear sequence. In other words, our method has been proved valid for both circular and linear forms regardless of where the cutting-point is (i.e., where the \u201cfirst\u201d base is), overriding any possible cutting-point errors.",

Most importantly, the circular and linear forms are both genetically and physiologically functioning in a coordinated way for a given genome in a given living microbe. That is, their forms are interchangeable when responding to real living conditions. Therefore, we can catch up the circular status of genomes during their life cycles.",

Namely, it is designed to extract the meaningful information but reduce the massive noise from the original millions of base pairs of genome sequences. Accordingly, there is no intention to go backward to perform extensive statistic analysis on such massive discrete data in a traditional way. Rather, we have developed the method of quantitative analysis by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. In particular, we have defined the geometric center (,,) and its following geometric mean () of a given genome fingerprint map to determine the Euclidean distance (), the differentiate rate (), and the weighted differentiate rate () in order to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. In fact, the applications with certain examples (Table 3) have demonstrated that the differentiate rates generally vary from family to family starting from least at strain/species level (<50%) to higher at genus level (<500%) to even higher at beyond family level (<1500%), which seem promising to be as the basic rules for setting up the general boundaries at certain levels of taxonomical units.",

As stated earlier, those data (Table 3) demonstrated that, from family to family, the genus levels were not within the same range of divergence in terms of the differentiate rates, implying no possibility of setting up a universal boundary for simply distinguishing all taxa. We thus recommend that the inference based on the (weighted) differentiate rate and the Euclidean distance be conducted under clear biological contexts because of two major reasons. First, such inferences should not be made solely based on the differentiate rates when dealing with outliers encountered (Table 3). For instance, Halogeometricum boringquense 11551 (NC_014729) vs. Halomicrobium mukohataei 12286 (NC_013202), two genera seemed very similar ( = 1.58%) by chance resulting from the very similar values of , but they were actually quite different in terms of their geometric centers, which were also verified by the large values of the Euclidean distance and the weighted differentiate rate (Table 3). Second, it is still unclear to determine a precise boundary corresponding to the taxonomical hierarchy because we found that the differentiate rates of outliers dramatically varied (Table 3), implying no such a boundary could be possibly determined under current knowledge. We thus remind that there is a huge gap to be fulfilled before eventually setting up the upper and lower boundaries in the real-world for different levels of taxa (strains, species, genera, families, and beyond).",

For example, considering very fewer genome sequences available within certain taxonomic units resulting in very small sizes of samples, the traditional empirical methods of statistical inference and hypothesis testing (such as the normal z-test and student\u2019s t-test) would not be appropriate. As such, we suggest that the permutation-based randomization test, such as bootstrap, should be developed for such statistic analyses in order to better use the outcome dataset of the genome fingerprint analysis. To this end, for example, the geometric center, the Euclidean distance and the (weighted) differentiate rate as potential statistical estimators should be kept worthy of being further explored with more real-world data at large scale in future.",

Second, we have developed a set of concepts and tools (3D-P, 2D-TP, GF, GFM, P-GFM, S-GFM, UGFM, TGCC, UGFM-TGCC, SCG, UGFM-TGCC-SCG), and thereby established a method called the universal genome fingerprint analysis (UGFA). Particularly, we have demonstrated that the UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG tools have great advantages over other conventional methods. Third, we have constructed a method of quantitative analysis to compare two genomes by using the outcome dataset of genome fingerprint analysis. Specifically, we have defined the geometric center (,,) and its following geometric mean () for a given genome fingerprint map, followed by the Euclidean distance (), the differentiate rate () and the weighted differentiate rate () to quantitatively describe the difference between two genomes of comparison. Moreover, we have demonstrated the applications through case studies on various genome sequences crossing diverse genetic components (chromosomes, plasmids, and phages) and crossing diverse biological categories (bacteria, archaeal bacteria, and viruses) with far divergence (less or no homology) over large size range (4 kilo-\u223c5 mega-base pairs per sequence), giving tremendous insights into the critical issues in microbial genomics and taxonomy.
