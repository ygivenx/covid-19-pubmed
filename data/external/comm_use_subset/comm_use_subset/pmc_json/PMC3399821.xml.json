            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the prototype of the aphthovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. FMDV causes a contagious disease that affects cattle and a large number of wild cloven-hoofed ungulates [1], [2]. The viral genome consists of a positive sense, single-stranded RNA of about 8500 nts, encoding a single polyprotein, flanked by a heavily structured untranslated region (UTR) at the 5\u2032end (Fig. 1A). Upon entry into the cell, the viral open reading frame is translated into a polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteases [3]. In common with all picornaviruses, the FMDV genome does not contain the cap structure (m7GpppN) typically present in cellular mRNAs at its 5\u2032 end. Instead, a viral protein (VPg) is covalently linked to the 5\u2032end of the viral RNA [4]. The 5\u2032UTR comprises a long hairpin (termed S), a poly(C) tract of variable length, a variable region folding as two to four pseudoknots, the cis-replication element (cre), and the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element that mediates cap-independent translation of the viral RNA [5], [6], [7]. The 3\u2032UTR consists of a region of about 90 nt and a poly(A) tail, which stimulate IRES activity and participates in viral RNA replication [8], [9]. Replication of the viral genome occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Polyprotein synthesis can start at two in-frame AUG codons separated by 84 nt [10]. Both AUGs are used as start codons for viral protein synthesis, although the second one is preferentially utilized in a variety of assays [11], [12].",

            "text": "Picornavirus IRESes are cis-acting elements that recruit the 40S ribosomal subunits to the mRNA with the help of cellular trans-acting factors [13]. The FMDV IRES is distributed in structural domains (Fig. 1A) with the first 21 nt (domain 1) forming part of the cre element [14]. Domain 2 includes a polypyrimidine tract (UCUUU) that provides a polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) binding site [15]. Domain 3 consists of 210 nts, the most apical region of which is arranged as a cruciform structure that plays a crucial role in RNA-RNA interaction [16], [17]. The proximal part is organized as a base-paired structure interrupted with bulges that include several non-canonical base pairs and a helical structure essential for IRES activity [18], [19]. Domain 4, which is organized into two hairpin-loops with A-rich internal bulges conserved between FMDV and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [20] is responsible for the interaction with the translation initiation factor eIF4G [21], [22], an essential step in FMDV and EMCV IRES-dependent translation initiation. Domain 5 is composed of a conserved hairpin-loop and a polypyrimidine-rich tract preceding the first functional AUG codon. Specific RNA motifs located in domains 2, 4 and 5 are responsible for the interaction with cellular proteins such as PTB, eIF4G, eIF3 and eIF4B, amongst other host factors controlling internal initiation [23].",

The differences in the accessibility of the IRES to DMS suggested that the IRES region adopts a different conformation in the cell cytoplasm compared to naked RNA. Similarly, results of UV-crosslinked amino-methyl psoralen-treated cells showed a local reorganization of RNA structure. Recent Selective 2\u2032Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) structural analysis revealed a modular organization of the IRES region [25]. Additionally, clusters of SHAPE reactive nts indicated the presence of flexible regions, hairpin-loops and internal bulges within the IRES domains [26]. Accessibility to the FMDV IRES was also studied through hybridization of fluorescent-labeled IRES transcripts with complementary oligodeoxynucleotides printed on microarrays. It is worth noting that the accessible regions in the microarray were also reactive to SHAPE probing, except for specific nts within the apical region of domain 3, around the GNRA (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine) stem-loop [26].",

            "text": "Antisense oligonucleotides are single-stranded sequences that form a hybrid with their complementary RNA via Watson-Crick base pairing. The resulting hybrid can block gene expression by various mechanisms, depending on the chemical composition of the oligonucleotide and location of the hybrid. The strength of the hybrid depends on factors such as thermodynamic stability, the secondary structure of the target mRNA, and the proximity of the hybridization site to functional motifs on the designated transcript such as translational start site. Unmodified oligonucleotides are unstable within cells due to rapid nuclease degradation. By contrast, phosphorothioate [27] and 2\u2032O-methyl oligoribonucleotides, carrying the 2\u2032-OH residue of the ribose molecule replaced by a methyl group, are resistant to degradation by cellular nucleases [28]. 2\u2032O-methyl antisense oligoribonucleotides (2\u2032OMe AONs) form high melting temperature heteroduplexes with targeted mRNA [29] and induce antisense effect by a non-RNase H-dependent mechanism [30], [31]. Earlier studies have been conducted to investigate the use of antisense transcripts to inhibit FMDV viral gene expression directed against the functional AUGs [32] and to both, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTR [33], [34]. An independent study using antisense morpholino oligomers targeting the viral RNA start codons also showed the capacity of these small molecules to inhibit viral FMDV multiplication [35]. The latter study showed controversial results with a previous work [36], in which phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to AUG2 inhibited virus multiplication with greater effect than those complementary to AUG1. Despite all these studies, a deep analysis of molecules targeting the entire IRES element to inhibit viral RNA expression in cells and in vitro was lacking.",

The results indicate that the AON targeting AUG2 inhibited FMDV viral multiplication more efficiently than that which targeted AUG1 in susceptible cells. By contrast, the results obtained using cell-free systems indicated that AUG1 was the best target to inhibit translation. Remarkably, four AONs (183, 207, 432 and 452) complementary to conserved motifs within the apical region of domain 3 and domain 5, that play key roles in internal initiation [17], [37], [38], were potent inhibitors in both systems, revealing accessible IRES regions which are candidate targets for small molecules interfering viral infectivity. Furthermore, the accessibility of different regions of the IRES to 2\u2032OMe AONs exhibited important differences when comparing the results obtained in RNA-transfected cells or in vitro translation of the same RNA. These differences, which are likely due to the composition of the cell cytoplasm and the cell-free system, emphasize the need to use living cells to measure the inhibitory capacity of small molecules.",

The control RNA, without any AON, was efficiently translated, as expected. Analysis of the translation efficiency of FMDV RNA annealed to AONs AUG1 or AUG2 revealed a marked difference in protein synthesis (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the data observed in transfected cells, translation efficiency in the presence of AUG1 (15%) was significantly lower than that observed in the presence of AUG2 (Fig. 2B). Translation of viral proteins in the presence of AUG2 (75% of the value observed with the control RNA alone) was non-inhibitory (P<0.01). No inhibition was observed in the presence of SCR, again showing a sequence-specific effect of AONs.

The capacity of each oligonucleotide to inhibit viral yield, measured by plaque forming units (PFU), was determined 24 hpt.

These results were confirmed by the reduction of VP1 intensity in a western blot assay using cytoplasmic cell extracts (Fig. 4B).

Interestingly, virus yield analysis revealed that AONs 183 and 207, complementary to the GNRA and the RAAA stem-loops respectively (Fig. 3), reduced FMDV RNA infectivity to about 40% (Fig. 5A). However, AONs 164 and 176, complementary to the sequences immediately upstream of the GNRA motif, did not affect virus yield. Moreover, the 3\u2032region of the GNRA and RAAA motifs were resistant to the effect of AONs 192 and 213. Differences in the efficiency of VP1 viral protein synthesis 24 hpt were confirmed by western blot (Fig. 5B).

In both cases, the inhibition observed was dose-dependent and sequence specific (Fig. S1). These results are consistent with a preferential use of AUG2 in infected cells [39], as well as with the higher inhibitory capacity of antisense oligoribonucleotides targeting AUG2 [36], independently of using FMDV RNA-transfected cells or FMDV infection (Fig. 9).

However, several AONs complementary to the apical region of domain 3 were inhibitors in vitro but not in living cells. In agreement with this result, differences in DMS and amino-methyl psoralen accessibility to naked FMDV IRES or RNA expressed in the cell cytoplasm were already noticed [24]. Since RNA structure of this particular IRES region is constrained by tertiary interactions [16], [26], it is likely that the composition of the cell-free system differs in cofactors influencing RNA structure. Further, the differences in gene expression observed with the FMDV RNA when transfected in susceptible cells or translated in vitro suggested important conformational changes, which may depend on the interaction of the IRES with transacting factors present in different concentrations in the cell cytoplasm. In addition, interactions with other cis-acting RNA elements such as the FMDV 3\u2032UTR [44], modification of host factors in infected cells [45]\u2013[50], or the specific intracellular environment of viral replication [51]\u2013[54] may differentially affect expression in these systems. However, since hamster BHK-21 or swine IBRS-2 cell lines are known to have an inactive type I IFN system in response to FMDV infection [55], [56] it is unlikely that the differences observed between the in vitro lysates and the transfected cells are due to type I interferon production.",

Disruptions caused by the AONs targeting domain 5 were not tolerated, as reflected by the reduced infectivity of FMDV RNA in the presence of the AON complementary to the hairpin (432) and the single-stranded region (452) (Figs. 6A and 7). The inhibition induced by AONs complementary to domain 5 had similarities to those noted by AONs 40, 183 and 349, complementary to domain 2, the apical region of domain 3, or domain 4 (Fig. 3). Another possibility to explain the inhibition noticed in domain 5 could be the steric block caused by the AONs, interfering in the landing site of the translational machinery.",

The viral titer from the 24 and 48 hpt supernatant was determined by counting the viral plaques that developed after 24 hpi [33]. The virus yield was calculated as the mean of PFU/ml of three independent assays of FMDV RNA transfected BHK-21 cells with each 2\u2032OMe AONs relative to the PFU/ml of FMDV RNA transfected without oligonucleotides, which was set at 100%. Cell monolayers were used to determine ASO cytotoxicity by cell staining at the end of the treatment.",
