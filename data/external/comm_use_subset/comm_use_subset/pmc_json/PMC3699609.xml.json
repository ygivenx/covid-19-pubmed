            "text": "\nAcinetobacter baumannii, one of the important nosocomial pathogens, is often associated with epidemic outbreaks of infection. The organism is frequently pandrug-resistant and capable of causing substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with severe underlying diseases, both in the hospital and in the community [1]. Rapid identification of this pathogen is critical for the appropriate therapy and outbreak control. Conventional methods, such as a phenotypic system and commercial phenotypic method, have successfully identified most Acinetobacter species. However, these methods can not distinguish Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU, and require specific media and several days of incubation [2]. DNA- based methods have been successfully applied in the detection of A. baumannii\n[3], [4]. However, these methods have been hampered by inconsistent results with culture-based methods. Moreover, most protocols developed for identification of A. baumannii by PCR have used primers complementary to a universal region found in several different bacterial genera, so that DNA from bacteria belonging to other genera might also be amplified [2], [5]. However, as progress is made towards better outbreak control, more sensitive tools will be required in order to detect low level of A. baumannii. Therefore, further efforts are needed to develop next generation molecular tools for field use with a goal that such tools can complement, or in some situations, replace the existing molecular methods for A. baumannii detection.",

It is based on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis in the presence of Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) polymerase under isothermal conditions. Six primers are used to recognize eight distinct regions on the target sequence [7]. Given that this method does not require a thermocycler or sophisticated training, it has the potential as a molecular diagnostic tool for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis. Indeed, LAMP has been used for the detection of several infectious diseases such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n[8], Plesiomonas shigelloides\n[9], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [10], human immunodeficiency virus-1 [11], and Plasmodium vivax\n[12].",

The method has been used to detect different human-infecting plasmodium species [14]. This method is referred to as real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RealAmp). In this study, we demonstrated the utility of this method for the detection of A. baumannii and distinguishing A. baumannii from Acinetobacter genomic species 3, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus by using species-specific primers and comparing it to an automated identification system VITEK 2 system and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.

A. baumannii ATCC19606, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU were grown overnight in Luria\u2013Bertani broth at 37\u00b0C. Pure genomic DNA was extracted from A. baumannii ATCC19606 using a TaKaRa MiniBEST Bacterial Genomic DNA Extraction Kit Ver.2.0 (TaKaRa Code: DV810A), and the genomic DNA was subjected to serial 10-fold dilutions in sterilized distilled water to produce concentrations ranging from 100 ng/\u03bcL to 1 pg/\u03bcL and assess the correlation between time to amplification and amount of target DNA. In addition, the number of colony forming units/mL (CFU/mL) was determined by using plate count. To test the limits of detection of RealAmp, overnight cultures were serially diluted (ten-fold) in Luria\u2013Bertani broth from starting inocula of 1\u00d7107 CFU/mL to 101 CFU/mL before DNA extraction. In addition, to evaluate the specificity of RealAmp, DNA extracts from the array of bacterial species were tested (Table 1). One hundred and sixty-two spontaneous early-morning sputa from patients evaluated using light microscopy (WBC \u226525 and epithelia cells <10 per 100\u00d7field) were qualified. Ninety sputum samples identified as A. baumannii positive and 72 sputum samples as A. baumannii negative by VITEK 2 system (BioM\u00e9rieux Inc, France), were used to assess the RealAmp assay. All positive samples isolated from sputum were confirmed to be the species of Acinetobacter by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A. baumannii ATCC19606 DNA was used as a positive control. Blood sample DNA from healthy individual was used as a negative control. Each of the molecular tests was carried out and interpreted by independent researchers blinded to the origin of the specimens and the laboratory results. Samples with discrepant results in the 2 tests were retested.",

The ESE-Quant Tube Scanner used in this study was developed by a company (QIAGEN Lake Constance GmbH, Stockach, Germany). This device has an eight tube holder heating block with adjustable temperature settings and spectral devices to detect amplified product using fluorescence spectra. This equipment weighs about 1 kg with the dimensions 74 mm\u00d7178 mm\u00d7188 mm. The unit is completely portable and can be operated with a Li-Ion rechargeable power pack without external power supply. A small liquid crystal display (monitor) is available to display the results (as positive or negative) without the need of a computer. However, the device can also be used together with a computer to generate real time amplification plots as the reaction progresses [14].",

However, multiplex PCR can pose several difficulties, including poor sensitivity or specificity and/or preferential amplification of certain specific targets. The presence of more than one primer pair in the multiplex PCR increases the chance of obtaining spurious amplification products, primarily because of the formation of primer dimers [20], [22]. Real-time PCR assay have many advantages over conventional PCR, including rapidity, lower contamination rate, higher sensitivity and easy standardization.

However, there are considerable epidemiological and clinically relevant differences among these species. To our knowledge, A. calcoaceticus is an environmental organism, which has never been involved in serious human disease, and therefore it should not be misidentified as A. baumannii\n[26]. The natural habitats of A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU are unknown, as are the differences in their epidemic behaviors, resistance mechanisms, and pathogenicities. Acinetobacter genomic species 3 can be found regularly on human skin, as well as in aquatic environments [27]. Acinetobacter genomic species 3 has also been implicated in nosocomial infections, but its tendency for epidemic spread and resistance development is far less obvious than that of A. baumannii\n[27]. For epidemiological and clinical purposes, it is very critical to differentiate among these species correctly. In our study, the species-specific primers were designed to distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. However, the previously reported LAMP test based on A. baumannii targeting the 16S\u201323S rRNA intergenic spacer sequence could not effectively distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter genomic species 3 and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU [13].",

Culture-based assays, on the other hand, detect all living bacterial cells grown in the culture media.
