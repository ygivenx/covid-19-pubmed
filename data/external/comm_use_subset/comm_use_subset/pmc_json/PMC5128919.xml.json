While it was previously thought that flaviviruses do not possess any RNAi suppressors, it was recently proved that these viruses do possess VSRs that are active in both insect and mammalian cells2627. In case of alphaviruses, reports have suggested that RNAi suppressors in this class of viruses may either be weak or undetected due to inappropriate assay conditions437. We undertook the present study to systematically evaluate CHIKV proteins (Fig. 1a) for possible RNAi suppressor activity using a Sf21 RNAi sensor cell line developed in our lab16. Using this RNAi sensor cell line, in which GFPshRNA is expressed constitutively to silence GFP in a GFP Sf21 cell line; we checked for reversion of GFP due to RNAi suppressor activity of the cloned CHIKV genes in pIB vector using flow cytometry (Fig. 1b and c). Post 72 h transfection, it was observed that nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 showed a reversion in GFP expression of 60%, 55% and 40% respectively (p values < 0.0001). The other genes showed reversion similar to empty vector. DENV RNAi suppressor NS4B and flock house virus protein B2 served as positive controls.",

Having checked suppressor activity of all CHIKV genes using an established cell line based assay, we next checked for their suppressor activity in its natural hosts, namely a mosquito and mammalian system. For this purpose, we utilised an Aedes cell line, Aag2 and the mammalian cell line, HEK293T. Using transient transfection protocols in which GFPshRNA in pIZT/V5-His and pGFP VRS plasmid were co-transfected with nsP2/nsP3 pIB/pCDNA3.1+ plasmids in Aag2 and HEK293T respectively (Fig. 2a), we evaluated suppressor activity of all nine genes. Overall, it was seen that transfection worked better in HEK as compared to Aag2 owing to better transfection efficiency in the mammalian system. With respect to GFP reversions, it was observed that nsP2 and nsP3 showed significant reversion (p value < 0.001) in both Aedes and HEK cell lines (Fig. 2b and c). In case of nsP4, however, RNAi suppressor activity was not evident in both the natural hosts and only around 25% GFP reversions were seen in the cells upon transfections with nsP4. Based on these results, we identified CHIKV_nsP2 and CHIKV_nsP3 to possess RNAi suppressor activity and further proceeded to validate these findings.",

Western analysis also revealed increase in GFP expression in nsP2 and nsP3 transfected cells as compared to Sf21 RNAi sensor cells (Fig. 3a). In addition to the above mentioned in vitro assays, we utilised transgenic Nicotiana leaf based assay to validate RNAi suppressor activity of nsP2 and nsP3 under in vivo conditions38. The putative VSRs were cloned into the plant binary vector pBI 121 and reversal of silencing by agro-infiltration-mediated transient ectopic expression of CHIKV nsP2 and CHIKV nsP3 was assessed in transgenic tobacco leaf tissues in which GFP is silenced. The infiltrated leaves showed reversal of GFP activity at 3 days post-infiltration in nsP2 and 5 days post-infiltration in nsP3 as seen under UV light (Fig. 3b and c). In the infiltration experiments, FHVB2 plasmid was used as positive control and a mutated FHVB2 expressing plasmid as negative control. GFP reversal was further confirmed by analysing GFP transcript levels and the depletion of small RNA population of GFP in the leaves using Northern hybridisation. 18 s RNA and 28 s rRNA were used as loading controls for mRNA and small RNA Northerns respectively. (Fig. 3d). While there was an increase in the GFP mRNA levels in leaves infiltrated with nsP2 and nsP3, GFP small RNAs showed 50% and 80% decrease in their population in the leaves infiltrated by nsP2 and nsP3 respectively thereby providing evidence that CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 are influencing small RNA production post-transcription.",

            "text": "Even as the assays in different systems provided enough clarity as to presence of RNAi suppressor activity in CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3, the first strong proof for any RNAi suppressors is its role in interfering with the RNAi machinery. The most well known mechanism is the ability of VSRs to bind to dsRNA/siRNA population thereby preventing RISC from acting upon them. This phenomenon has been evaluated by studying the binding of suppressor protein to double stranded RNA population resulting in a shift in their mobility efficiency716. For this purpose, we expressed both nsP2 and nsP3 in the heterologous E.coli system. While we were able to produce nsP3 in its natural folded form, nsP2 aggregated into inclusion bodies and could not be purified, most probably owing to its large size. To overcome this problem, we expressed both CHIKV_nsP2 and CHIKV_nsP3 in Sf21 cell line by transient transfection (Supplementary Fig. S2). Using cell lysate of the transfected cell expressing nsP2 and nsP3, we evaluated their ability to bind double stranded RNA by using [\u03b332P] labeled shRNA of GFP and running the bound complex in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3e). Binding of shRNA to nsP2 and nsP3 proteins were evident by complex formation and shift that increased proportionally to protein concentration (Fig. 3e-lane no. 2, 3, 4, 5). Addition of cold shRNA probe served as competitive inhibitor of binding reaction and the decrease in the intensity of the shift proved the binding specificity of the complex. Untransfected Sf21 lysate in the presence of non-specific inhibitor (salmon sperm DNA) of varying concentrations and GFPshRNA served as negative controls (Fig. 3e-lane 1, 8, 9, 10). These results clearly proved nsP2 and nsP3 bound to dsRNA. Taken all these findings together, we conclude that CHIKV nsP2 and CHIKV nsP3 are suppressors of RNAi.",

Alternately, VSRs may also impede loading of siRNAs into the RISC and consequently block functionalization of siRNA loaded RISC37.A direct way to assess effect of VSRs on siRNA formation is to estimate dicing enzyme activity in vitro in the presence of the VSRs. Unfortunately, our attempts to purify CHIKV nsP2 in its active form were unsuccessful, hence we resorted to cell based FACS assays to gain preliminary insight into possible suppression mechanism. Using SF21 GFP cell line, we transfected dsRNA or siRNA- GFP and subsequently co-transfected with the VSRs to estimate the level of GFP reversal. We reasoned that GFP reversal was an indication of where the VSRs may act \u2013 if they acted during dicing, then the reversal would be evident upon co-transfection with dsRNA+VSRs and if they acted at the time of siRNA loading into RISC, it would be evident while using siRNA+VSRs. Our results showed there was >50% GFP reversion with both dsRNA and siRNA for both nsP2 and nsP3 (Fig. 4a and b), thus highlighting that their mode of action may be downstream of RISC loading in the RNAi pathway.",

This protein is 90 kDa and consists of four domains, the 180 aa long N-terminal domain, 240 aa long domain that exhibits helicase activity, 200 aa long protease domain and a 160 aa long C terminal domain43 (Fig. 5a). Similarly, nsP3 exhibits phosphatase activity and also consists of a macrodomain that has been well characterised32. This is 57 kDa and consists of three domains (Fig. 5c). The macrodomain, present on the N-terminus, is a globular domain 162 aa long and is evolutionary highly conserved. Most of the activities exhibited by the protein are associated with this domain. The sequence of central part of nsP3 (162 aa) is conserved only among alphaviruses and hence is termed alphavirus unique domain (AUD). The C-terminal domain (204 aa) is termed hypervariable region, since it has no sequence similarity even among alphaviruses. Having confirmed that both nsP2 and nsP3 exhibit RNAi suppressor activities, efforts were taken to characterise the proteins better and to identify those specific domains that were responsible for RNAi suppressor activity. For this purpose, each of the domains was cloned individually in pIB/V5-His TOPO vector and transfected into the Sf21 sensor line. For convenience, the domains were labelled as N2D1, N2D2, N2D3 and N2D4 in nsP2 and N3D1, N3D2 and N3D3 in nsP3. In case of nsP2, N2D2, the domain that is responsible for helicase activity showed maximum reversion of GFP expression and in nsP3, N3D1, i.e., the macrodomain showed maximum reversion (Fig. 5b and d).",

Presence of RNA binding motifs and presence of GW/WG motifs has been shown to be important features required for binding to dsRNA/siRNA and Argonaute loading44. To understand the sequence structure of the domains that showed maximum suppressor activity in nsP2 and nsP3, we identified the RNA binding motifs within the domains showing maximum reversions in both the VSRs (Fig. 6a and c). Furthermore, we hypothesized that these features are important amongst all species of alphavirus. To test this hypothesis, we aligned the sequences of all known alphaviruses nsP2 and nsP3. To date, complete sequence information is available for 15 alphavirus species. As expected, all RNA binding motifs were conserved in both nsP2 and nsP3 proteins across all species (Fig. 6b and d). Additionally, we observed the presence of one GW motif in domain 2 of nsP2 in all species. Taking all these aspects, we hypothesize the RNAi suppressor activity of CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 may be conserved across all alphaviruses.",

Substituting all or most of the amino acids in motifs with alanine through site directed mutagenesis, we generated mutants. Three mutants were generated in nsP2 with different permutations and combinations of substitutions, while two mutants were generated in nsP3. Schematic representation of mutant generation is depicted in Fig. 7a and b. GFP reversal in these mutants were evaluated using Sf21 RNAi sensor line and the results are shown in Fig. 7c. Further, we performed mobility shift assays to evaluate the binding capacities of the domains and the mutants generated using [\u03b332 P] labeled shRNA of GFP and running the bound complex in a 6% polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 7d). Complex formation due to dose dependent binding of shRNA to the mutants of nsP3 and nsP2 are evident (lane 3, 4, 14 and 15 respectively). In the same manner, binding efficiencies of the domains to shRNA are demonstrated in lane 6, 7, 11 and 12 respectively. The results clearly show the involvement of the RNA binding motifs in the binding to dsRNA and we conclude that these motifs play a direct role in RNAi suppressor activity. nsP1-Sf21 lysate in the presence of non-specific inhibitor (salmon sperm DNA) and GFPshRNA served as negative controls (lane 1, 9, 10).",

While their infections in mosquitoes are mainly asymptomatic and persistent, in vertebrate hosts, the infection is acute and self limiting31. Efficiency of virus replication in both vector and host depends not only on the expression of its own proteins but also on its ability to counteract upon host antiviral defence. Mosquito innate immune system poses a serious challenge to virus infection and activates different defence pathways including TOLL pathway, IMD (Immune deficiency) pathway, JAK STAT pathway and RNAi pathway45. RNAi pathway is a major antiviral defence mechanism employed by insects that results in degradation of viral RNA thereby curbing infection1234. Viruses employ numerous strategies to evade host RNAi response, including mutations in or near the target to bring conformational changes rendering RISC inaccessible46 and VSRs which inhibit or compete with Dicer/other RNAi components, thus decreasing the amounts of viably loaded RISC complexes74647.",

However, since alphaviruses do not cause as severe illness as the flavivirus, it was assumed that VSR activity against RNAi defence might be detrimental for the host, thus reducing virus transmission3649. Using an in-house developed GFP reversion assay1626, we report that CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 are RNAi suppressors. Certain VSRs such as Geminivirus nuclear protein Ac2 have been previously shown to transactivate host genes50.

In our study, nsP2 has shown stronger VSR activity in comparison to nsP3. Earlier reports have shown this protein exhibits anti-IFN activity52, emphasising on the overlapping nature of interferon and RNAi pathway. Domain mapping of this protein revealed the domain that possessed helicase activity showed maximum activity for RNAi suppression. Interestingly, helicases such as HeIf of Dictyostelium, B2 of Wuhan nodavirus and NS3 of dengue virus has been proven to exhibit VSR activity154853. Of interest is the presence of a GW motif, conserved across all alphavirus species studied, that is known to be important for binding to dsRNA/siRNA and Argonaute loading44. The crystal structure of CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain reveals that this domain possesses RNA-binding activity33. This protein is also known to modulate pathogenicity in mice54. Our study has provided evidence of an additional role of the macrodomain and clearly elucidates it role in pathogenicity as a viral suppressor of RNAi. The existence of both nsP2 and nsP3 in both the nucleus as well in the cytoplasmic fraction5556 may help in their interactions with the various components of the RISC complex.",
