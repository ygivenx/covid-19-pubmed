            "text": "In order to systematically identify viral components of MHV-68 that modulate the expression of ER chaperone genes, we conducted a genomic viral ORF screen using a reporter system based on GRP78 expression. GRP78 is the most abundant ER resident chaperone and is highly stress-inducible29. The reporter construct (GRP78-fluc) used in the study contains the promoter region of GRP78 driving the coding sequence of firefly luciferase gene3031. GRP78-fluc was co-transfected into the 293T cells with PGK_renilla-luciferase (an internal control plasmid in which the renilla luciferase expression is driven by the constitutively active PGK promoter), and either individual ORFs of MHV-68 or a vector control. The reporter activity was measured by dual-luciferase assay 24 hours post transfection. From the screen, a strong induction (>6-fold) on the reporter was consistently noted with multiple clones of M1 (Fig. 1A and data not shown); in contrast, transfection with the sequence-related M3 showed basal-level activity comparable to that of vector control. The observed changes in reporter activity were specific for the stress response elements within the promoter region of GRP78, because M1 had no effect on the mutant reporter plasmid (GRP78mut-fluc) in which the response elements were eliminated30. In line with the reporter assays, the endogenous mRNA and protein levels of GRP78 were also upregulated in a dose-dependent manner with M1 expression as shown, respectively, by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B) and western blot analyses (Fig. 1C).",

It should also be noted that when performing a titrated transfection of the plasmid encoding M1, strong activation of the chaperones genes was observed even with a small amount of the plasmid (0.06 ug/60 mm-dish) however no effect was seen in cells transfected with maximal amount of the M3-encoding plasmid (2.4 ug/60 mm-dish) (Fig. 1A and data not shown).",

We speculated that in order to accommodate the newly-synthesized folding machineries, the amount or the size of the ER must have changed dramatically as described previously32.

Sequence analysis of M1 and M3 showed that both proteins contain signal peptides and cleavage sites located close to the N-terminus. The results also indicated that both M1 and M3 are secreted proteins, an observation confirmed in our study (Fig. S1) and by other groups2528. It has been well established that in eukaryotic cells, nascent proteins destined for secretion first enter the ER, where they are modified and assembled prior to transit into the secretory pathway. Indeed, both M1 and M3 proteins localize to the ER, as evidenced by significant co-distribution of the HA (M1/M3) and concanavalin A (Con A) signals (see below). Conc A is a probe reported to recognize the residues of \u03b1-mannopyranosyl and \u03b1-glucopyranosyl commonly found in the ER and Golgi apparatus.",

Importantly, expression of M1\u0394SP did not activate luciferase expression from the GRP78 promoter, indicating that the ER localization of M1 is required for its function (Fig. 4D).

All four clones were also engineered with an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag. This arrangement allowed us to determine whether the N-terminal cleavage took place due to the presence of the signal peptide. Cells were transfected with individual clones and subject to western blot analysis using HA and FLAG antibodies respectively (Fig. 4B). As expected, proteins bearing the M1 signal peptide sequence (i.e.: M1, M1SPF2, M1SPM3) could not be detected by the HA antibody (upper panel: Lane 1, 4, 6) indicating a cleavage at the N-terminus. In addition, IFA analysis revealed that all three proteins located to the ER (Fig. 4C). In contrast, clones without the signal peptide (M1\u0394SP, M1F2) were detectable by both HA and FLAG antibodies (upper and lower panels: Lane 2, 3), and IFA analysis showed that these proteins are distributed throughout the cells with no specific ER localization (Fig. 4C). It is noteworthy that the HA antibody picked up a small amount of M3 protein suggesting that cleavage of M3 was incomplete when the protein is translated and processed (Lane 5). And the retarded cleavage became more evident in M3SPM1 expression (Lane 7) indicating that the M3 signal peptide causes slower cleavage than does that of M1.",

Similar to what we observed with M1\u0394SP, the M1F2 had no effect on the reporter activity. However, with the addition of M1 signal peptide, the mutant protein (M1SPF2) induced reporter activity to the same degree as wild type M1. More interestingly, while M3 had no effect on GRP78 expression (Fig. 1), by replacing its own signal peptide with that of M1, the M3 protein became a modest inducer of the GRP78 reporter (~a 2-fold increase). On the other hand, not surprisingly, even with a swapped signal peptide, the ER-localized M3SP+M1 was still capable of stimulating the GRP78 promoter (Fig. 4D).",

In cells expressing M1, an elevated level of XBP1s was observed, manifested by an increased amount of spliced products that are resistant to PstI digestion (Fig. 5A). To quantitatively measure the splicing of XBP1, we employed a splicing-specific reporter system (pXBP1u-fluc). pXBP1u-fluc consists the coding sequence of firefly luciferase conjugated to the second ORF of XBP1u. Therefore, the luciferase is expressed only after IRE1-induced splicing removes the 26-nt intron33.

It was later reported by the same group that secreted M1 protein act as a viral superantigen and is responsible for V\u03b24+ CD8+ T cell stimulation during MHV-68 infection in mice28. However, it has not been fully elucidated whether M1 plays a role inside the host cell. Here we discovered a novel function for the intracellular M1 protein. We found that M1 differentially modulate the UPR signaling cascades and preferentially induces the two chaperone-producing branches to activate ER chaperone expression. Specifically, the M1 protein stimulates the IRE1 and the ATF6 axes but spares the PERK pathway of UPR signaling (Fig. 7). It is of interest that the virus selectively acts on the beneficial aspects of the UPR program while avoiding the detrimental features. One possible explanation is that the virus takes advantage of different stress sensing or activation mechanisms deployed by the three ER transmembrane sensors (i.e. IRE1, ATF6 and PERK). Although it is still unclear how these signaling proteins sense the ER stress, a recent study used the three-dimensional structure analysis to demonstrate that IRE1 activation is actually caused by direct binding to the unfolded proteins rather than by chaperone association as suggested earlier on9. This finding implicates that the three branches of UPR signaling network may be distinctly modulated at the initiation stage. We propose that certain undefined properties in the M1 protein leads to the differentiated modulation on the UPR sensors. Therefore, using M1 as a tool may offer a unique opportunity to dissect the mechanism underlying UPR sensing and regulation.",

We suspect that the 18-aa signal peptide of M1 protein plays an important role in switching on the IRE1 and ATF6 signaling axes through mechanisms that worth future investigation. Still, the presence of the intraluminal portion of M1 is critical to reach the full potential of its function in activating ER chaperone genes.

            "text": "It has been extensively reported that during a wide array of virus infections, cellular chaperones are elicited and play essential roles at various stages of the viral life cycle. Accumulating studies have shown that viruses are able to engage the host chaperone machinery to support effective cell entry and nuclear import16353637, viral genome replication3839, viral protein expression and folding171819, and virion assembly404142. In addition, examples have been found wherein viruses pack the host chaperons into the virion core before egress and that the incorporated proteins are necessary for invading new cells43. More surprisingly, some viruses can even encode proteins that exhibit chaperone-like activities to facilitate their infection (e.g.: TAg of SV40)44. Furthermore, host chaperons are also utilized by the viruses to manipulate other cellular processes. Earlier studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of chaperone proteins can protect cells against apoptosis and confer resistance to cytotoxic and antimicrobial drugs4546. Several reports further proposed that specific inhibition of the infection-induced chaperones may provide a solution to the appearance of drug resistant pathogens47. One recent study found that the inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone in vitro and in vivo can prevent the outgrowth of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid48. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that improper activation of the UPR pathways and uncontrolled production of chaperones can adversely affect the immune response, a phenomenon exploited by certain viruses for an adaptive advantage4950. To sum up, by augmenting the expression of chaperone proteins can create an environment favorable to virulence and may have become a survival tactic among different viruses. In response to such high demand of cellular chaperones during infection, viruses have the urge to evolve mechanisms to boost the chaperone production.",

It is natural that different viruses adopt distinct approaches to tackle similar environmental challenges. For instance, previous studies have found that the M2 protein unique to MHV-68 enhances the cellular interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression to promote B cell growth and differentiation51 while EBV encodes a viral IL-10 homolog to achieve the same goal52. Another example is the regulation of cell cycle through cyclin D: MHV-68 and KSHV depend on encoding the conserved viral cyclins53 whereas EBV utilizes a viral gene (EBNA3C) to enhance the functional activity of cellular cyclin D1 for cell cycle progression54. Though relevant examples are lacking in regulation of UPR, previous work on human cytomegalovirus (beta-herpesvirus) has shown that viral infection can upregulate GRP78 expression without affecting the UPR pathways55, while studies on the herpes simplex virus type 2 (alpha-herpesvirus) revealed that the virus can encode a protein with chaperone-like activity. Therefore, although M1 is unique to MHV-68, we strongly believe that the human gamma-herpesviruses possess distinct chaperone-regulating approaches to achieve similar goals.",

Briefly, the target sequence was divided into two fragments with an overlapping region of 100\u2013200 bp. The two fragments were inserted upstream and downstream of a kanamycin-resistance cassette that contains an adjoining I-SceI site in a transfer plasmid with the backbone of pGEM-7zf(+). Using the resulting plasmid as a template, PCR was performed with primers bracketing the two sequence fragments and kanamycin-resistance cassette. The PCR product was subsequently digested with DpnI to eliminate the template plasmid, followed by gel extraction and electroporation into SHG68 competent cells harboring MHV-68 BAC, at 1.8 kV, 200 \u03a9, 25 \u03bcF (1 mm cuvette). Positive transformed clones were then made subject to second round Red recombination that removes the kanamycin-resistant cassette. The resulting Kan-sensitive clones were confirmed by sequencing and expanded for BAC DNA purification. The viral BAC DNA was transfected into 293T cells with an equal amount of plasmids expressing the Cre recombinase to remove the BAC sequence. Three days post transfection, single viral clones were isolated through limiting dilution, validated by PCR, and propagated.

The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to renilla luciferase activity was calculated based on the value of the vector control (set as 1). This assay and all following assays were performed in triplicates. Error bars show standard deviation. (B) Cells were transiently transfected with the M1 or M3 expression plasmids for 24 hours and were harvested for RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a primer set specific for GRP78 (Table 1). The levels of GRP78 mRNA were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. The fold changes shown were calculated relative to the values obtained in vector-transfected cells (set as 1).
