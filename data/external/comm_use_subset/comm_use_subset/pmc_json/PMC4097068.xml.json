            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) first emerged as an infectious disease ten years ago, manifesting itself as a severe form of pneumonia. Its etiological agent was identified as a then novel coronavirus known as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1], [2]. Within a short span of time from December 2002 to July 2003, the newly emerged virus spread quickly to infect more than 8000 people across 25 countries with an overall fatality rate of approximately 10% [3]. SARS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that has crossed the species barrier to infect humans. Small animals such as palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procynonoides) sold in live-animal wet markets in Guangdong Province of Southern China are believed to be the zoonotic source of the virus transmitted to humans [4]. In 2005, the complete sequences of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) of genetic homology of 87\u201392% to SARS-CoV were identified from horseshoe bats of the genus Rhinolophus in China [5], [6]. However, these SL-CoVs display significant differences in sequences at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) compared to SARS-CoV and are unable to use the SARS-CoV receptor, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cellular entry [7], rendering them unlikely to be the immediate progenitor of SARS-CoV. More recently, a bat SL-CoV capable of using the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry was characterized and isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats, providing strong evidence that bats are the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV [8].",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV is classified as a virus from the genus betacoronavirus (lineage B), family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of genome size of approximately 29.7 kb, encoding for 16 non-structural proteins, 8 accessory proteins and 4 structural proteins (namely the spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M] and nucleocapsid [N] proteins) [9], [10], [11]. Every surface spike of the SARS-CoV is composed of a trimer of S protein of 1255 amino acids in length. The S protein is a type 1 glycoprotein and a class 1 fusion protein responsible for viral attachment and entry into host cells, and is therefore the principal determinant of host range [12]. It consists of 2 functional subunits: the N-terminal S1 subunit (amino acids 15\u2013679) and the C-terminal S2 subunit (amino acids 680\u20131255). The S1 subunit contains the RBD [13], [14] that recognizes the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2 [15], allowing the attachment of the virus to its host cell. The S2 subunit contains the putative fusion peptide and two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, important in SARS-CoV fusion with target host cells [16], [17]. Upon the association of the RBD with the ACE2 receptor, a conformational change of S2 is triggered, resulting in the insertion of the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane [18], followed by the interaction of the HR1 and HR2 domains in an anti-parallel manner to form a stable six-helical bundle fusion core [17], [19]. This allows the viral membrane and target cell membrane to come into close proximity, facilitating membrane fusion and viral entry [20], [21].",

            "text": "Besides its roles in viral entry, the S protein is also a major antigenic determinant in eliciting humoral immune responses in infected humans [22] and is therefore an important target in the development of vaccines and therapeutic intervention against SARS [23], [24]. Numerous human and murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) binding to the S1 or S2 regions of the S protein have been identified and were shown to confer neutralizing activities in vitro and protection in vivo against SARS-CoV infection [25], [26], [27], [28]. The S1 subunit of the S protein, especially the RBD, is highly variable among coronaviruses, resulting in a wide range of tissue tropism, while the S2 subunit is a well-conserved domain, indicating the highly conserved nature of the fusion process [29]. As a result, anti-S2 mAbs have broadly neutralizing characteristics against a wider range of SARS-CoV variants, including human and zoonotic SARS-CoV strains, through the recognition of highly-conserved epitopes [28], . In our previous study, it has been shown that a panel of murine mAbs targeting the HR2 domain and the region upstream of HR2 of the S protein are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV infection in vitro\n[31]. In this study, the cross-neutralization ability of one of these mAbs, termed as 1A9, was investigated by studying its ability to prevent viral entry mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV strain from civet as well as SL-CoV strains from bats. MAb 1A9 binds to the loop region between the HR1 and HR2 domains and this region is highly conserved but has no known function (Figure 1). In addition, escape mutants against mAb 1A9 were generated to identify critical residues important for mAb 1A9 binding to S protein. We found that mAb 1A9 has broad cross-neutralizing activity and identified a single amino acid (aspartic acid) at position 1128 in S to be crucial for the interaction with mAb 1A9. By using a pseudotyped viral entry assay, it was shown that the substitution of this residue with alanine (D1128A) mediates escape from mAb 1A9 neutralization. In addition, the D1128A mutation exerts no effects on the expression of S on the cell surface and its incorporation into virion particles, suggesting that the escape virus retains the same viral entry property as the wild-type virus.",

In this pseudotyped virus system, replication incompetent lentiviral particles that express S proteins on the surface were used in replacement of live SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs. This system has been successfully employed in the study of highly pathogenic viruses including the influenza virus [33] and SARS-CoV [34], [35], [36]. Neutralizing antibody titers measured using pseudotyped SARS-CoV correlated well with the use of replication competent SARS-CoV [37], as such, this system has been widely used in the evaluation of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies [30], [38], [39], [40], [41]. In this study, the S-pps expressing human SARS-CoV S or RBD-modified chimeric S of civet SARS-CoV SZ3 strain and bat SL-CoV Rp3 and Rf1 strains were able to infect and enter CHO-ACE2 cells at similar extent (Figure S1A in File S1). The results obtained from the mAb 1A9 neutralization assay (Figure 2C, Figure S2 in File S1) showed that mAb 1A9, apart from being able to neutralize S-pp expressing human SARS-CoV HKU39849 S, was able to cross-neutralize the S-pp expressing chimeric S of civet SARS-CoV SZ3 and bat SL-CoV Rp3 and Rf1. This indicates that mAb 1A9 has broad neutralizing capability.",

In contrast, 100% CPE was still observed in escape mutant virus-infected cells even in the presence of 2 mg/ml of mAb 1A9 (Figure 4B), indicating that the mutant virus is resistant to neutralization by mAb 1A9.

As shown in Figure 5A, S protein containing mutation D1128A (S-D1128A) showed a reduced binding to mAb 1A9 compared to the wild-type S protein (S-WT), while S protein with the N1056K mutation (S-N1056K) did not show a reduction in mAb 1A9 binding compared to S-WT. While Western Blot reveals the binding of mAb 1A9 to denatured epitope on S, immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed to compare the mAb 1A9 binding to native forms of S. Consistent with the results obtained in Western Blot analysis, S-D1128A exhibited a decrease in mAb 1A9 binding compared to S-WT while S-N1056K did not (Figure 5B). Similar results were also observed in ELISA (Figure S3 in File S1) using wild-type and mutant D1128A and N1056K GST-S(1030-1188) fragments that were expressed from bacteria cells (Figure S4 in File S1). These results suggest that residue 1128 is important in the binding of mAb 1A9 to the S protein.

As seen in Figure S1B in File S1, all S-pps were able to infect and enter CHO-ACE2 cells, with the mutant S-pps showing a slightly lower infectivity compared to wild-type. They were then used to infect CHO-ACE2 cells in the absence or presence of different concentrations (25, 50, 100 and 200 \u00b5g/ml) of mAb 1A9 and the neutralization activities of mAb 1A9 against wild-type S-pp, S-D1128A-pp, S-N1056K-pp and S-D1128A/N1056K-pp were compared. MAb 7G12, an anti-S1, non-neutralizing mAb, was used as the control antibody at 200 \u00b5g/ml. As shown in Figure 6A and Figure S5A in File S1, at the highest concentration of 200 \u00b5g/ml, mAb 1A9 prevented the viral entry of wild-type S-pp and S-N1056K-pp in CHO-ACE2 cells by 36% and 35% respectively, while the entry of S-D1128A-pp was not significantly affected. At lower concentrations of mAb 1A9 (25, 50 and 100 \u00b5g/ml), similar results were obtained, suggesting that S-D1128-pp was resistant to mAb 1A9 neutralization. This further indicates that through a reduction in binding to mAb 1A9 (as observed in Western Blot, IP and ELISA), the D1128A mutation in S protein is sufficient to mediate the escape from neutralization by mAb 1A9. In addition, S-pp containing both D1128A and N1056K mutations was investigated for its resistance to mAb 1A9 neutralization. S-D1128A/N1056K-pp was also resistant to mAb 1A9 neutralization at a similar extent as the S-D1128A-pp (Figure 6A and Figure S5A in File S1), indicating no synergistic effects between the D1128A and N1056K mutations in conferring mAb 1A9 resistance to the viral particles. No resistance to neutralization was observed for all S-pp with mAb 1G10, another neutralizing mAb that binds to a different epitope within the S2 subunit at amino acids 1151\u20131192 (Figure 6B and Figure S5B in File S1).",

Vector-transfected, wild-type S-transfected and mutant D1128A S-transfected cells were incubated with mAb 7G12 (which binds to the S1 subunit of S) followed by an FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. A positive shift in fluorescence was observed in the wild-type S-expressing cells when compared to the vector-transfected cells (Figure 7A) because of the specific binding of mAb 7G12 to the native form of the S protein expressed on the cell surface. In comparison, the mutant D1128A S-expressing cells showed similar degree of shift in fluorescence as those expressing wild-type S (Figure 7A). Thus, the D1128A mutation did not reduce the surface level expression of the S protein, suggesting that this substitution at residue 1128 did not hamper the synthesis and processing of the S protein.",

            "text": "Although there has been no reported case of SARS-CoV infection in humans since 2004, the development of anti-SARS-CoV treatments and vaccines remains crucial as the threat of a re-emergence of SARS exists till today. Human and civet SARS-CoVs are believed to have originated from SL-CoVs residing in bats [42]. As coronaviruses are known to be capable of frequent cross-species transmission [12], the continual persistence of SL-CoVs in animal hosts and reservoirs poses a threat to humans should a cross-species transmission occurs. The development of broadly neutralizing mAbs that confer cross-protection not only against human SARS-CoV, but also zoonotic strains of SARS-CoV and SL-CoV, is therefore important. The putative S1 subunit of bats SL-CoVs has a low sequence homology of about 63% to that of SARS-CoV, especially in the RBD, indicating the usage of different host cell receptors and different tissue tropisms [43]. On the other hand, the high sequence homology in the S2 subunit of about 92\u201396% suggests that the fusion mechanism during viral infection is well-conserved [44]. Broadly neutralizing mAbs usually target conserved epitopes required for highly conserved process, such as the post-attachment fusion process [45]. A majority of SARS-CoV-neutralizing mAbs reported bind and target the S1 protein at the RBD region [46]. Nonetheless, neutralizing mAbs that bind to the S2 subunit have been reported. The epitopes of these mAbs are found to be located at the S2 subunit upstream of HR1 (residues 787\u2013809, 791\u2013805) [47], [48], within the loop region in between HR1 and HR2 (residues 1023\u20131189) [31], [40] and within the HR2 domain (residues 1151\u20131192) [31]. It has also been shown that anti-S2 mAbs that bind to the highly conserved HR1, HR2 and ectodomain of the SARS-CoV S protein were able to neutralize a wider range of clinical isolates, including human and zoonotic strains of SARS-CoVs [28], [30]. In this current study, mAb 1A9, an anti-S2 mAb that binds to the S2 subunit at the highly conserved loop region at residues 1111\u20131130, was demonstrated to be able to cross-neutralize pseudotyped S-pp viruses of the human SARS-CoV, civet SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV strains. This is consistent with the sequence conservation of the mAb 1A9 binding epitope in S. In addition, sequence alignment (not shown) revealed that the mAb 1A9 binding site is also conserved in other bat CoVs such as the Bulgarian SARS-related CoV strain [49], indicating the potential cross-protective effect of mAb 1A9 against not only bat SL-CoV from China, but also from other parts of the world such as Europe.",

As observed in this study, the IC50 value of mAb 1A9 is between 25\u201350 \u00b5g/ml, which is higher than that of RBD-targeting mAbs, indicating the lower potency of mAb 1A9. Higher IC50 values and lower potency have also been observed in several other anti-S2 mAbs [40], [52]. This can possibly be attributed to the inaccessibility of the S2 subunit, which constitutes the stalk region of S, as compared to the S1 subunit that is exposed on the viral surface [53]. However, SARS-CoV is capable of attaining mutations in the RBD region without affecting viral infectivity [54], leading to escape in mAb neutralization, while mutations within the highly conserved S2 subunit region are more likely to be detrimental to the mutant virus. Therefore, the characterization of anti-S2 mAbs remains important in the development of antibodies as anti-viral therapies against SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Through the generation of mAb 1A9 escape virus, it was found that the escape mutation D1128A in the S protein resulted in diminished binding to mAb 1A9 and S pseudotyped viral particles containing the D1128A mutation could not be neutralized by mAb 1A9. In addition, the substitution of D1128 by either N (having same side-chain as D) or E (having same charge as D) also reduced the interaction with mAb 1A9 to similar extent as the A substitution (Figure S6 in File S1). Thus, it appears that the D residue at position 1128 in the S protein plays an essential role in the interaction with mAb 1A9. Another mutation, N1056K, also identified in mAb 1A9 escape virus, was found to have no effects on mAb 1A9 binding and neutralization, indicating that this is most likely a random mutation that arose during the generation of escape mutants. No significant synergistic effect was observed between the D1128A and N1056K mutations in decreasing mAb 1A9 binding and conferring resistance to mAb 1A9 neutralization. As there is no information on the possible functional role of the mAb 1A9 binding epitope or the residue D1128, the cell surface expression of mutant S-D1128A and its incorporation into viral-like particles was compared to that of wild-type S. The results showed that S-D1128A is similar to wild-type S in these aspects, suggesting that viral entry property of the escape virus has not changed. In summary, we characterized mAb 1A9, a SARS-CoV neutralizing mAb that binds to a novel epitope located within the loop region located in between HR1 and HR2, at a position directly upstream of HR2 at residues 1111\u20131130 of the S protein that has not been previously identified and characterized. The aspartic acid at residue 1128 is crucial for the interaction of S protein with mAb 1A9 and a substitution to alanine in the escape virus is sufficient to abolish neutralization by mAb 1A9 but has little effect on the viral entry property. Consistently, while a detailed study on the fitness of the escape virus has not been performed, it was observed that the virus titre of the escape virus after 3 passages in presence of mAb 1A9 reached similar level as the wild-type virus (see Figure 3). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the mutation may affect viral virulence and further work is needed to address this. The loop region in between HR1 and HR2 in the S2 subunit is believed to be a region required for viral-cell membrane fusion, as peptides analogous to the loop region were found to inhibit SARS-CoV infection [55]. Although D1128 residue has not been shown to be directly involved in membrane fusion, it is probable that the binding of mAb 1A9 to the D1128 residue in the loop region causes steric hindrance that prevents the association of HR1 and HR2 to form the six-helical fusion bundle core. Hence, structural analysis of the interaction between mAb 1A9 and S is actively being pursued in order to define the inhibition mechanism of mAb 1A9.",
