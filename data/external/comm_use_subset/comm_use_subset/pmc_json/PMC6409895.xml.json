Exposure to fugitive emissions generated during aerosol therapy increases the risk of unnecessary inhalation of medication, as well as toxic side effects [5].

In addition, there is growing global concern about acquired antimicrobial resistance (AMI), with 480,000 people developing multi-drug resistant tuberculosis each year [13]; the use of nebulised antibiotics could potentially contribute to AMI among long-term caregivers who may have inhaled fugitive antibiotic-laden aerosol.

High-definition video imaging studies used previously-inhaled saline aerosol and smoke particles to estimate the dispersion distance of exhaled air for various systems. Exhaled droplets were observed exiting the side vents of a facemask, and substantial exposure to exhaled air was reported to occur within 0.8 m [17]. Nebuliser airflow, lung function and interface type were all reported to impact upon dispersion distance [18,19,20,21]. A limitation of the visualisation approach is that the visible boundaries of exhaled flows could only be used as a guide to the real behaviour of droplets in exhaled air [22].",

This study incorporated two non-invasive ventilation interfaces (facemask and mouthpiece) in combination with the commercially available aerosol generators. The VMN used a valved facemask, while the JN used an open facemask. For the mouthpiece scenarios, both an unfiltered mouthpiece and filtered mouthpiece were used with each setup. A filtered mouthpiece refers to a filter placed on the exhalation port, while an unfiltered mouthpiece refers to the case where no filter is placed on the exhalation port. To replicate the ideal conditions achieved when a patient uses an interface correctly, each mask was glued to a plastic sheet to avoid a leak, while the mouthpieces were attached using a custom fixture. A supplemental gas flow rate of 6 L/min was used with the VMN and the manufacturer-prescribed 8 L/min was used for the JN. ",

To determine the inhaled dose, each aerosol generator/interface combination was attached to an absolute collection filter (Figure 1). Albuterol is commonly nebulised as a medication, and also as a formulation used in the characterization of aerosol drug delivery systems, and is specified for use as a tracer aerosol [23]. In this study, albuterol was eluted from filter or nebuliser components using a wash buffer. Albuterol mass, expressed as a fraction of the nominal dose, at the end of each run was extracted and quantified using UV spectrophotometry (Biochrom UV Vis, Cambridge, UK) at 276 nm and interpolation on a standard curve of albuterol sulphate. The exhaled dose, the drug that was exhaled by the spontaneously breathing patient, was also characterised (mouthpiece testing only) by placing a collecting filter at the exhalation ports of each nebuliser/mouthpiece combination (Figure 1). Additionally, the residual mass, the drug that was available for nebulisation but remained in the device, was reported for both VMN and JN devices. All testing was carried out in triplicate.",

Throughout the experiments, the aerosol concentrations and size distributions of the aerosol were continuously measured in real time using two APSs, which were located at respective distances of 0.8 m and 2.2 m from the simulated patient. These distances were chosen on the basis that 0.8 m is approximately one arm\u2019s length away, simulating, for example, a caregiver holding a nebuliser/facemask to a patient\u2019s face. A distance of 2.2 m was chosen on the basis that it is approximately the distance between beds in a primary care centre, simulating a patient situated in a bed next to the patient receiving the aerosol therapy. A 5-min baseline level of aerosol was established in the room pre-nebulisation. Nebulisation was then initiated with the APSs recording data for 25 min, and at 20-s intervals. A duration of 25 min was sufficient for nebulising the entire dose with a period for aerosol decay post-dose. This testing was carried out concurrently with the aerosol dose distribution testing described above.",

In both cases, the unfiltered mouthpiece had reduced fugitive emissions compared with the facemask. Since there was no appreciable change in the residual drug analysis for the different facemask/mouthpiece combinations, it can be concluded that the mouthpieces\u2019 shape and size do not influence inertial impaction and deposition [36]. For the filtered mouthpiece combination, while there were some observed fugitive emissions from JN/filtered mouthpiece combination compared with the VMN, it is possible that the higher driving force required for the normal operation of the JN/mouthpiece caused additional system pressure, allowing aerosol to escape through the custom fixture; however, it is unclear if this would be replicated with a human patient. An earlier imaging study observed no emitted droplets when a respiratory filter was placed on the exhalation port [17]. Other research shows that attaching an exhalation filter to the nebuliser was 93% effective in capturing exhaled aerosol droplets [37]. Facemask design may also contribute to this. By necessity, compressor-driven jet nebulisers must be operated with an open facemask; i.e., one without valves. This, in combination with the continual positive pressure air flow, acts to force aerosol out of the device and into the environment throughout both the inhalation and exhalation cycles of the breath. This is not the case with the vibrating mesh nebulisers, where a driving air flow is not required for aerosol generation, and the valve system on the device described aids in building a reservoir of aerosol within the patient interface which is available for the next breath.",

            "text": "In the respiratory therapy context, the secondary exposure pathway is not widely understood. An adult breathing pattern in combination with a facemask/mouthpiece was used to replicate a standard nebuliser treatment and monitor the consequent release of fugitive emissions. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the first study that quantifies time-series aerosol concentrations and the size distribution of fugitive emissions that result from standard nebuliser treatment. The findings confirm a potential exposure risk to caregivers and other bystanders to medical aerosols and highlight that variations in patient interfaces (facemask and mouthpiece) and aerosol generators (VMN and JN) influence fugitively-emitted aerosol concentrations. The purpose of this study is to aid in developing approaches for healthcare organisations to inform policy and best practices for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions. Future studies should focus on investigating these factors in a real-life clinical scenario.",
