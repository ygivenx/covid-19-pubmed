However, the role of vaccination with attenuated viruses on the evolution of wild type strains is not often considered. Antigenic escape because of strong selection by vaccines, emergence of new strains through recombination, and increased virulence to expedite transmission of new genotypes in vaccinated populations are of potential concern. In this paper, we explored the consequences of vaccination on the evolution of class II aPMV-1, which is the etiological agent of ND.",

The first outbreaks of NDV were reported during the mid 1920s in Java, Indonesia and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England [2], and within a few years were occurring throughout the world [3]. The name ND is reserved exclusively for the disease that results from infection with strains of aPMV-1 that are pathogenic for domestic chickens [4]. aPMV-1 has been grouped by virulence phenotype, with lentogenic, mesogenic, and velogenic strains representing increasing levels of virulence, ranging from subclinical infections with moderate respiratory involvement to extensive hemorrhagic lesions and neurological signs [5]. Inactivated vaccines were first made commercially available to the poultry industry in 1946, but because they provided incomplete protection against ND [6], they were replaced with live lentogenic NDV vaccines. Although these vaccines reduce disease, they do not always prevent infection and birds can shed both vaccine and challenge strains of the virus [7], [8], [9].",

RNA-editing of P gene creates two additional proteins, V and W [12]. There are nine serotypes of aPMV-1; viruses associated with ND are in serogroup 1. Within serogroup 1 there are 2 major subdivisions, class I and II, based on phylogenetic grouping of the F gene [13]. Class I aPMV-1 are primarily recovered from waterfowl or samples from U.S. live bird markets, while the isolates from class II are commonly derived from poultry and other avian species [5], [14]. Eight genotypes of class II aPMV-1 can be identified [13]. Viruses belonging to genotypes I-IV have circulated since the 1930's. Genotype I and II consist of both lentogenic and velogenic viruses and have been associated with ND outbreaks in Australia and North America, respectively [5], [15], [16]. These viruses have been attenuated in culture and are used as modified live vaccines [16]. Genotypes V-VIII were first recognized in the mid-1960s [13] and contained only virulent viruses [16]. Genotype V was responsible for the second panzootic of ND in Europe from 1970\u20131974 and has been detected sporadically thereafter [17]. Genotype VI was described mainly from the Middle East and Asia during the 1980's\u20131990's [18] and genotype VII and VIII were reported in the 1990's from several countries [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. All genotypes, except IV [16], are still in circulation.",

In addition, evidence is accumulating that recombination is an important process driving genotype diversity for many RNA viruses [27], [28], [29]. Although recombination was not thought to contribute to aPMV-1 evolution [30], [31], evidence of recombination in NDV has recently been reported [32], [33], [34]. This debate may be due, in part, to the reliance on a single gene for determining virus diversity and phylogeny. Because recombination can lead to the emergence of novel virus strains of unknown virulence [35], [36], [37], [38], a better understanding of the role of recombination in circulating aPMV-1 is warranted.",

Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies were reconstructed for all sequence data sets under the appropriate nucleotide substitution model selected for each data set (Figure 1). Each gene tree and the concatenated tree revealed seven distinct genotypes within the class II aPMV-1. However, genotype affiliations were not congruent among different genes (Figure 1A). While genotype III, IV, V, VI, and VII were monophyletic, genotype I and II showed inconsistent phylogenetic relationships (Figure 1A and B). Three distinct patterns of affiliations of genotype I and II were observed among different gene trees. The NP, HN, L, and concatenated gene trees consistently placed genotypes I and II in a sister clade to other genotypes. In the P gene tree, genotype II formed a basal clade while genotype I clustered with the remaining genotypes and in the M and F gene trees, genotype I was the basal clade and genotype II clustered with the remaining genotypes.",

Chimeric NDV vaccine strain EU140955, which has the genotype II La Sota vaccine strain backbone and the F and HN genes from a contemporary genotype VII virus (Figure 1C), was included as a control to evaluate the prediction capability of the program. The predicted recombination breakpoint (detected by five methods with p-value<10\u22125) at position 7119 of the concatenated EU140955 matched correctly with the end of a SpeI restriction site of this chimeric strain where HN sequences were inserted from the KBNP-4152 strain. The MluI restriction site used to generate the chimera is within the intergenic region between M and F genes and is not present in our sequences. However, the RDP3 program reasonably identified the 5\u2032 breakpoint at the 8th nucleotide of the F-gene. Two additional recombination breakpoints within this insert were also detected by the GENECONV and Bootscan methods (p-value 2.29\u00d710\u22123 and 3.35\u00d710\u22122). These corresponded to the positions in the F gene segment of KBNP-4152 strain that were mutagenized to attenuate recombinant strain EU140955. Thus, we conclude that the RDP3 program accurately identifies recombination if five or more methods have statistical support of p\u226410\u22125 for the breakpoints and we propose that any breakpoints statistically supported with only one or two methods should be carefully interpreted.",

We confirmed that regions 508 to 926 (in NP) and 927 to 1511 (NP and P) are related to genotypes V and II, respectively by partitioning the data sets at the predicted break points and reconstructing a ML phylogeny (Figure 3). In the region 927 to 1511, AY562985 had seven unique synonymous substitution sites compared to the other sixteen genotype II sequences in our dataset. Isolate AY562989, which is predominantly of genotype VI origin, also contained a putative recombinant region spanning positions 2039 to 3225, which was derived from genotype II and had three unique non-synonymous substitution sites compared to other genotype II sequences. Isolate AY225110 is a chimera of genotype I and II sequences.

Prior to the emergence of genotype VII in the 1970s (phase i), genotype II showed an increase in population size (Figure 5B). After the emergence of genotype VII (phase ii) the population size of genotype VI began to increase, while that of genotypes I and VII were relatively constant. Phase iii depicts the time of the population bottleneck observed in Figure 5A, which was based on all genes in the composite genotype data set. Only genotypes I and VI show a trend for decreasing population size during this time. The last decade has been the most dynamical for the four genotypes of aPMV-1 (phase iv; Figure 5B). Genotypes I and VII showed a marginal increase in effective population size followed by a decline; genotype I has continued to decline, whereas genotype VII appears to have stabilized. Genotype VI showed continuous decline in population size in phase iv (Figure 5B). Although estimates of population sizes for genotypes I, VI, and VII, have some degree of overlaps at the 95% posterior limit, genotype II shows no sign of reduction in effective population size since its origin (Figure 5B).",

Overall, the global rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) for all protein coding genes were less than 1, indicating purifying selection has been the major driving force in the evolution of class II aPMV-1 viruses. There were no codons identified to be under positive selection in M and L genes in either group (Table 3). However, there was a clear difference in the codon based selection profiles of N, P, F and HN genes between the vaccine- and nonvaccine-related groups. In the vaccine-related group, only the surface protein encoding genes, F and HN, had positively selected codons. Both groups had a single site identified in F; these were at codon 115 within the F0 cleavage site for the vaccine-related group and codon 28 in the signal peptide for the nonvaccine-related group. There were 3 positively selected sites identified in the HN gene in the vaccine-related group and one in the non vaccine-related group. In contrast, the P gene of nonvaccine-related genotypes III-VII had three sites predicted to be under positive selection but no sites were identified in the vaccine-related group. Thus, selection is focused on HN in vaccine-related groups and on P in nonvaccine-related genotypes and there are no shared sites under positive selection between the two groups.",

            "text": "Our study explored the forces shaping the evolutionary history of class II aPMV-1 using available full genome sequences. We demonstrated that genotype affiliations based on individual genes and concatenated full length genomes of class II aPMV-1 were not consistent. This may account for discrepancies reported for genotype groupings that are based on partial or complete sequences of a single gene [13], [18], [43]. Topological incongruence among the gene trees reflects different evolutionary histories of each gene [44]; recombination is the most plausible explanation for this. The role of recombination in the evolution of aPMV-1, and negative sense RNA viruses in general, has been debated. For example, Sakaguchi et al. [30] and Toyoda et al, [31] reported consistent topological placement of different NDV strains in both F and HN gene trees. Seal et al. [45] also reported that there was no evidence of recombination among NDV M gene sequences. Although recombination is more common in positive-sense RNA viruses and can be explained by several genetic mechanisms [46], there is increasing evidence of homologous recombination in several non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses [32], [47], [48], [49], [50]. Our approach differs from those used in previous studies of aPMV-1 evolution because we evaluated full genome sequences and tested individual recombinant regions with phylogeny-based incongruence tests. Thus, we show that all class II aPMV-1 genes have evidence of recombination breakpoints, that multiple recombination events are discernable in some isolates, and that both intragenic and intergenic recombination events are evident. We considered the possibility that the recombinants detected in our analysis were the result of laboratory artifacts, as has been previously suggested [32], [51]. Laboratory contamination is of concern because vaccine derived strains contributed the majority of the recombinant regions and these strains might have been present in laboratories sequencing field aPMV-1 isolates. The presence of unique nucleotide substitutions in the recombinant regions compared to the comparable region of the predicted parental genotypes suggests that these regions did not arise due to contamination with vaccine strains deposited in the sequence databases.",

Indeed vaccination is reported to protect poultry from disease but not always from infection with other strains [7], [8], [9]. Suboptimal vaccination strategies could also lead to birds becoming infected with both a vaccine strain and circulating genotype, which can alter viral virulence [16]. This is an important issue for poultry management. Lack of vaccine efficacy has not frequently been reported in the United States but other countries such as Nigeria [52], Korea [53], Taiwan [54], and China [34], [55] have experienced vaccine failures. Recombination between wild type virus and vaccine strains is not unique to aPMV-1; vaccine recombinants of bovine viral diarrhea virus (associated with fatal mucosal disease) [35], poliovirus (associated with paralytic poliomyelitis) [36], [37]; and infectious bursal disease virus [38] have all been reported. This raises concerns that modified live virus vaccines, although efficacious, may facilitate emergences of new strains with unpredictable phenotypes through recombination with circulating viruses.",

The larger effective population size, which counters the impact of genetic drift, is a possible explanation for lower evolutionary rates of genotype II. Based on these rate estimates, the TMRCA of this virus is estimated to be between 1868\u20131891, which is earlier than the first recorded outbreak of ND in Indonesia and England in the 1920's [2]. However, our data are in line with observations by Macpherson [59], who suggested that an outbreak of disease in domestic birds that occurred in Northwest Scotland from 1897\u20131898 was due to NDV.",

We expected that vaccination, which started worldwide in the 1950s, should have limited the number of susceptible avian hosts, thus causing a bottleneck for this genotype. However, the impact of NDV vaccination is not seen in the BSP. It is possible that the data available in GenBank is insufficient to capture the population history of this genotype. However, a plausible explanation for the absence of a population bottleneck could be that genotype II NDV is maintained as an asymptomatic infection because it is continually introduced to susceptible populations as a modified live vaccine. Vaccination effectively prevents birds from developing disease when exposed to a virulent strain, but does not prevent shedding [7]. Thus, the number of available susceptible hosts may not dictate genotype II population demographics.",

Notably, P gene had the highest dN/dS ratio of any gene and had three sites predicted to be under selection in the nonvaccine-related group; there were no sites under selection in P gene in the vaccine related group. In contrast, HN had three sites predicted to be under selection in the vaccine related group. Of interest, codon 115 in the F cleavage domain is positively selected only in vaccine-related groups. Previous studies have reported that a single amino acid substitution at codon-115, which falls within the F0 cleavage site, resulted in a dramatic change from an avirulent infection to highly virulent NDV [64], [65], [66]. In contrast to the results reported in the present study, Miller et al [33] did not identify codon115 in F gene under positive selection. This is likely due to differences in the data sets because factors such as sequence length, sequence divergence, and the number of sequences can determine the ability to detect positively selected sites [67]. Thus, the vaccine-related genotypes I and II maintain a phenotypic mixture of strains with different infection and pathogenic potential and selection profiles.",

Demographic history of a population/species using multi-locus data, even from a small number of individuals, can precisely recover past bottlenecks in population size that cannot be characterized by analysis of a single locus [78]. Given this fact, estimates based on the whole genome sequence data are expected to be more reliable. To determine the population history of individual genotypes, 149 complete F gene sequences, which had dates of collection, were retrieved from GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses were done as described previously (Table S2). From the ML tree, a total of 97 isolates from genotype I, II, VI, and VII were selected to infer evolutionary rates and population dynamics. These included all available dated full length sequences from Genotypes I (24 sequences), II (28 sequences), and VI (23 sequences). The majority (95%) of genotype VII sequences were of Chinese origin. Thus, we included the seven non-Chinese sequences and picked an additional 15 sequences based on phylogenetic diversity to represent genotype VII in our analyses. The evolutionary rate (nucleotide substitutions per site per year) of each gene and concatenated genome was estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses (independent assumption of codivergence). Substitution models of both HKY + G4 and GTR + G6 with estimated base frequencies, gamma and invariable site portion were used, with uncertainty in the data reflected in the 95% high-probability density (HPD) intervals. Strict clock and uncorrelated exponential (UCED) relaxed clock models were attempted independently, and the best-fit clock model was determined to be UCED based on the Bayes Factor calculated from their posterior distributions (Table S3). The Coalescent Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) was used to infer the past population dynamics. The BSP was constructed using the growth rate and demographic parameters from the selected best-fit models. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) analyses were run for 5\u201310\u00d7108 generations depending on each dataset. Convergence of trees was checked using Tracer v1.4.1 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer).",
