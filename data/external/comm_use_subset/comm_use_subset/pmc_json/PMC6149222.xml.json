The attachment to cells enables KSHV to interact with entry promoting receptors allowing the virus to eventually enter the cell8,9. In a recent study, we determined that interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane-1 (IFITM1) expression to significantly enhance KSHV infection of human B and endothelial cells10. In opposition to this process, over-expression of microRNA (miRNA)-36 (miR-36) significantly lowered expression of IFITM1 and thus the virus entry.

There are two genetically and functionally distinct families of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that have antiviral properties, they are IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) and IFITMs. IFITs contribute to an antiviral state against some viruses by binding components of the eIF3 translation initiation complex and inhibiting protein translation11. In contrast, IFITMs block viral infection at the entry stage12. IFITMs are a double-edged sword when it comes to influencing viral entry; they can also enhance viral entry13,14. Interestingly, IFITM1 expression not only enhanced KSHV infection of cells, but also infection of cells with a closely related herpesvirus belonging to the \u03b3-herpesvirinae subfamily, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)10.",

IFITM1 transcript (Fig. 1A) and protein expression (Fig. 1B) levels were significantly elevated with EBV and KSHV infection of BJAB cells. The expression of IFITM1 increased in virus infected cells as early as 5 min post infection (PI) which was elevated by 10 min and 15 min PI in BJAB, but significantly declined by 30 min PI (Fig. 1B). We observed a similar IFITM1 expression profile during early stages of viral infection in human microvascular dermal endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). We also performed binding assays to decipher if just binding of KSHV and EBV is enough to induce IFITM1 expression in BJAB cells. Our results (Fig. 1C) demonstrate binding of the wild-type or the UV.inactivated virus is not enough to induce IFITM1 expression.

This was possible by monitoring the expression of ORF50 transcript as a measure of infection. In the current study, we analyzed internalization of the \u03b3-herpesviruses by monitoring the internalized viral DNA (Fig. 2A) compared to the expression of ORF50 and BRLF-1 transcripts (Fig. 2B). BJAB cells expressing IFITM1 supported a significantly enhanced KSHV and EBV infection compared to those cells that were left untransfected, mock transfected, or transfected with the empty vector. To authenticate the role for IFITM1 in enhancing infection of \u03b3-herpesviruses, we tested the effect of silencing IFITM1 on the internalization of the viruses. Briefly, we first transfected cells with siRNA specific for IFITM1. Northern blotting and Western blotting were performed at 0, 12, 24, and 48 hours after transfection as per the standard protocols to monitor IFITM1 mRNA and protein expression levels, respectively. A maximum IFITM1 mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein (Fig. 2D) inhibition were observed in cells transfected with siRNA specific to IFITM1 at 12 h post transfection. On the same lines, internalized \u03b3-herpesviruses in cells silenced for the expression of IFITM1 was significantly lower compared to cells that were untransfected or transfected with (NS)siRNA (Fig. 2E). Taken together, the results clearly implicate a role for IFITM1 in enhancing KSHV, and EBV infection of cells.",

            "text": "Many different types of cellular sensors can detect viruses and induce the expression of the type I interferons (IFNs)\u2014IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Type I IFNs bind to the ubiquitously expressed IFNAR (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor), activating the JAK/STAT pathway17,18. The type I IFN response can induce the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) which primarily serve to limit further virus spread and infection19. IFITMs are a family of proteins that have gained popularity as novel antiviral ISGs20. IFITMs are a member of the interferon-induced 125\u2013133 aa protein family including IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10. This family of proteins is located on chromosome 11 of the human genome and originally described as highly inducible genes by \u03b1- and \u03b3-interferons (IFNs)21,22. IFITM proteins are significantly upregulated by type I and II IFNs and are critical for anti-viral innate immune responses23,24. Recent reports indicate IFITMs play a significant role in virus entry. IFITMs inhibits entry of many RNA viruses including influenza A H1N1 Virus, West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus, HIV, and HCV23,25,26. However, IFITMs can also enhance viral infection of cells: (i) both IFITM1 and IFITM3 modestly enhance human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) infection of a variety of cells;13 (ii) Zhao et al. have shown type I IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and type II IFN-\u03bb to significantly promote infection of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43 by the induction of IFITM proteins. The authors reported that the over-expression of IFITM3 significantly increased susceptibility of Huh7.5 cells to HCoV-OC43 infection;14 and (iii) Inhibition of IFITM1 expression by specific miR-36 mimic significantly inhibited early stages of KSHV infection of human B and endothelial cells10. In general, the IFITM family of proteins affects virus entry of cells.",

Binding of KSHV and EBV to target cells is not sufficient to induce IFITM1 expression (Fig. 1C). We went one step further in demonstrating that over-expressing IFITM1 significantly alters not only the internalization of the \u03b3-herpesviruses (Fig. 2A) but also the ability to establish infection as monitored by the expression of the respective viral transcripts (Fig. 2B). Also, silencing expression of IFITM1 by specific siRNAs resulted in a significant drop in the number of internalized viral particles (Fig. 2E). IFITM1 promotes \u03b3-herpesvirus infections at a post-binding stage of entry as silencing IFITM1 did not alter the KSHV and EBV binding to the cell surfaces (Fig. 3). KSHV utilize HS as binding receptor6. EBV also interacts with HS expressed on epithelial cells via glycoprotein gp15027. Generally, speaking, BJAB cells are thought to be resistant to KSHV and EBV primarily because B cells do not express HS28. Recent studies determined BJAB cells to express HS28 and that KSHV and EBV can efficiently infect them6,29,30. In our hands, treating EBV with soluble heparin blocked binding to BJAB cells due to one or both of the following reasons: (i) Just like MHV-68 and KSHV, HS may have a role to play in EBV infection of BJAB cells; and (ii) High concentrations of soluble heparin used could have a steric bulk effect on the virus binding to cells. We are aware of this discrepancy associated with the role of HS in EBV binding and entry. In the current study, soluble heparin was only used as a control and further elaborate studies should be conducted prior to ruling in or out a role for HS in EBV entry into BJAB cells.",

Therefore, to understand the in vivo effects of IFITM1 on \u03b3-herpesviruses, we used MHV-68 as a model virus. Leukocyte counts were increased in response to MHV-68 infection of mice (Table 1). This increase in the leukocyte count was significantly lowered when the mice were primed with siRNA compared to (NS)siRNA and PBS. We did not observe atypical lymphoid monocytes in the mice from all the groups used as it was too early to observe any such changes. Priming mice with siRNA specific to IFITM1 significantly lowered expression of IFITM1 in lungs compared to PBS, (NS)siRNA (Fig. 5A). It was determined by plaque assay and qPCR that a decrease in the expression of IFITM1 resulted in a significant decrease in MHV-68 infection of lungs obtained from the mice (Fig. 5B,C). This study focused primarily in monitoring infection of lungs because intranasal MHV-68 infection of mice results in acute lytic infection of lungs followed by the establishment of lifelong latency33. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time a crucial role for IFITM1 in the in vivo infection of \u03b3-herpesviruses.",

Numerous mechanisms by which IFITM proteins alter virus entry have been proposed and it is not limited to the following: (i) acting as pattern recognition receptors by sensing virus infection and activation of downstream cellular signaling pathways;23 and (ii) reducing membrane fluidity and curvature, and by possibly disrupting intracellular cholesterol homeostasis34,35. Albeit, none of the mechanisms have been confirmed. Future studies will be aimed at delineating that eluding mechanism by which IFITM1 enhance the internalization of the \u03b3-herpesviruses. These studies are crucial because they help us understand the role of ISGs in modulating \u03b3-herpesvirus infection of cells. In addition, the results from this study will benefit in designing IFITM1 targeted therapies to treat cancers36,37, and \u03b3-herpesvirus infections including that of HIV38 and HCV39.",

The results presented are a representative data and the original full-length blots of the cropped images is provided in Supplemental Fig. 4. (D) Western blot demonstrating the effect of silencing the expression of IFITM1 using siRNA. Cells transfected with siRNA specific to IFITM1 were lysed 12 h post transfection. The cell lysates were resolved on a SDS-PAGE gels, proteins transferred on to a PVDF membrane prior to conducting Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. The results presented are a representative data and the original full-length blots of the cropped images is provided in Supplemental Fig. 5. Data representing the IFITM1 (C) mRNA and (D) protein expression levels are presented as fold increase (average \u00b1 s.d. from three experiments) in the boxes below the panels. (E) Silencing the expression of IFITM1 by siRNA significantly decreased EBV and KSHV infection of cells. BJAB cells were either un-transfected, transfected with IFITM1-specific siRNA, or transfected with (NS) siRNA before infecting with KSHV, or EBV. Data was plotted to represent the percentage of virus infection as determined by monitoring the change in copy numbers of internalized viral DNA. Bars (A,B,E) represent average \u00b1 s.d. of five individual experiments. Columns with different alphabets indicate the values to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) by LSD.",

Data was plotted to represent the percentage of EBV or KSHV binding to BJAB cells treated differently compared to the untransfected cells. (B) EBV and KSHV were allowed to bind at 4 \u00b0C to BJAB cells that were untransfected, or transiently transfected with IFITM1-specific siRNA, or (NS) siRNA. Viruses incubated with soluble heparin and chondroitin sulfate served as controls. After 60 min, cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde. Thin sections were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Enveloped virus particles bound to the cell surfaces of randomly selected 10 cells were counted by three different individuals using three different grids of their choice and the numbers were averaged.
