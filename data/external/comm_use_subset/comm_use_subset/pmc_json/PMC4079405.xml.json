Animals that appear normal and healthy may be unsuitable as research subjects due to unobservable, but significant local or systemic effects of viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites with which they may be infected. There has been a steady increase in the awareness of the varied and generally unwanted effects of natural pathogens in laboratory animals, and there have been even greater efforts to exclude pathogens from these animals (1). Valid experimental data can only be generated and interpreted when laboratory animals are free of pathogens that may alter the host physiology.",

            "text": "In the late 1990s, a series of studies emerged describing the occurrence of idiopathic pulmonary lesions, characterized by lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs, in laboratory rats (2,3). The lymphohistiocytic nature and eventual resolution of the lesions indicated an infectious etiology. Although attempts to identify the etiology of this disease have been unsuccessful, a previous study detected a limited cytopathic effect in cell lines that had been incubated with lung tissue homogenates from diseased rats, and the pulmonary lesions were reproduced in rats inoculated with the cultured cells (4). In conjunction with the perivascular and interstitial distribution of the lesions and the lack of an identifiable etiologic agent, these observations led to the tentative conclusion that the lesions were caused by a novel rat virus. The term rat respiratory virus (RRV) was adopted to confer a putative viral etiology to the idiopathic pulmonary lesions and has been used over the past decade (5\u20138). In a study of rats from research institutions in North America, ~6% of the rats evaluated exhibited histological evidence of idiopathic pulmonary lesions consistent with RRV infection (RRV-type lesions) (9).",

Livingston et al (7) demonstrated that Pneumocystis DNA was present in the lungs of several immunocompetent rats with RRV-type lesions. In addition, Henderson et al (8) confirmed a causative association between P. carinii infections and the time course and severity of interstitial pneumonia in immunocompetent laboratory rats. Consequently, these authors have proposed this prevalent, once idiopathic disease, to be called P. carinii pneumonia (PCP). P. carinii is a single-celled fungal respiratory pathogen of mammals that is transmitted via an airborne route (10,11). Although P. carinii is known to cause a severe and often lethal pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts (12\u201314), several studies have found PCP in immunocompetent hosts, including rats and mice naturally or experimentally infected with Pneumocystis spp. (5,15\u201319).",

Since P. carinii has been detected in a wide variety of commercial rat colonies (20,21), assessing the presence of Pneumocystis infections in rats is necessary prior to their experimental use. Based on the latest evidence indicating that P. carinii causes the infectious interstitial pneumonia that was previously attributed to RRV in laboratory rats (7,8), the present study investigated whether the lesions observed were caused by P. carinii infection. To evaluate the transmissibility and time course of the lesions, naive rats were introduced into an endemically infected colony and the pulmonary histopathology was assessed over a 14-week period.",

            "text": "Health surveillance of laboratory animals is conducted since adventitious infection is a realistic possibility that can have a significant, negative impact on animal research (9). Although infectious interstitial pneumonia, a prevalent and transient interstitial pneumonia of immunocompetent laboratory rats, had been attributed to a putative virus referred to as RRV, the etiology of infectious interstitial pneumonia has not been established (4,22). In the present study, naive rats housed on 50% soiled bedding from the cages of colony rats with RRV-type lesions were shown to develop lesions identical to those of the colony animals. In addition, P. carinii was found to be an etiologic agent of infectious interstitial pneumonia in a group of immunocompetent laboratory rats. The observations support previous data that demonstrated the transmissibility of the condition. Widespread presence of P. carinii has been documented in the lungs of clinically-healthy, commercially-produced immunocompetent rats (5,23). The infectivity of P. carinii in immunocompetent laboratory animals has also been supported by previous studies (7,8,15,16,19,24). Henderson et al (8) demonstrated that P. carinii infection was transmitted to immunocompetent rats by bedding transfer and direct contact with contagious animals. In addition, Gigliotti et al (16) demonstrated that brief cohousing with P. carinii-infected mice resulted in infected immunocompetent mice. There was active replication of the organisms in the immunocompetent host such that the organism was transmitted to other Pneumocystis-free immunocompetent mice, again with active replication. Similarly, Chab\u00e9 et al (19) found that healthy host-to-healthy host transmission of Pneumocystis organisms can occur, and that Pneumocystis organisms are able to replicate in the lungs of immunocompetent hosts, indicating that these hosts are a reservoir for P. carinii. The observations of the present study are consistent with these studies.",

Foamy eosinophilic exudates containing GMS-positive Pneumocystis cysts were also detected. Gross lesions appeared during week 7, while the microscopic lesions necessary for diagnosis appeared slightly earlier at week 5. The time course of the observations indicated that the lesions were mild at week 5, severe lesions appeared between week 7 and 10 and resolution occurred by week 14 following exposure. This time course is similar to that observed in a previous study by Albers et al (6), but not consistent with that of a recent study by Livingston et al (7) that found that the lesions in rats were first observed at week 3, most severe at week 5 and were resolved by week 7. The reason for this difference in lesion onset, progression and resolution is unknown, but may reflect several factors, including the timing of infection, strain of Pneumocystis, strain of rat and other environmental factors.",

Thus, immunocompetent rat colonies have not been routinely tested for Pneumocystis infections. Now that an etiology for RRV-type lesions has been identified, Pneumocystis-specific diagnostic tests, including histopathological examination for the identification of pneumonia and other organisms and PCR assays for the detection of Pneumocystis DNA, can be used to detect infected rats and monitor colonies for Pneumocystis infections. Previously, histopathology was the only diagnostic assay available to detect rats with idiopathic pneumonia, now known as PCP (6). However, high-throughput immunoassays to detect serum antibodies against Pneumocystis and quantitative PCR to quantify Pneumocystis DNA expression may also be used in the testing of rat colonies for this pathogen.",

Furthermore, as the sources of P. carinii for the experiments were infected rat lungs and not pure cultures, it cannot be claimed categorically that no other agent is involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia. For instance, a virus transmitted with P. carinii may contribute to the disease by facilitating Pneumocystis colonization of the lower respiratory tract in immunocompetent hosts. However, the participation of an infectious agent other than P. carinii in the pathogenesis of interstitial pneumonia is highly improbable for the following reasons. Firstly, routine surveillance of the colony used in the experiments did not detect any known pathogens. Secondly, novel pathogens are infrequently found in long-used and intensively characterized laboratory animal species, such as the rat.",
