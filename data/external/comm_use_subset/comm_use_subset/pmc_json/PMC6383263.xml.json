RNAs of many DNA viruses and RNA viruses also have a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail that is synthesized in a post-transcripitional manner, similar to mRNAs, or derived from a poly(U) sequence on the template strand [6\u201311]. The poly(A) tail of viral RNA may have at least two major functions mimicking roles of the stable poly(A) tails in eukaryotic mRNA. One of these is the control of RNA decay, which is associated with viral RNA stability [12, 13]; the other is the regulation of translation of viral proteins, which may be mediated synergistically by poly(A)-binding protein and initiation factor eIF4G [14, 15]. However, poly(A) tails of RNA viruses have different characteristics from those of eukaryotic mRNAs, including relatively shorter length and variable length [16, 17]. In addition to serving as the template for translation, RNA of RNA viruses also serves as the template for the synthesis of complementary the strand during replication [18\u201320]. Poly(A) length is related to the synthesis of complementary strand as well as virus infectivity [17, 21, 22]. It is implied that polyadenylation of RNA viruses could have more multi-level functions than that of mRNAs.",

WYMV was first identified in Japan [25] and has been subsequently reported in East Asia [24, 26, 27]. WYMV belongs to the genus Bymovirus in the family Potyviridae, whose members are 3\u2032 polyadenylated and contain a 5\u2032 genome-linked protein VPg [26]. WYMV has two positive single-strand RNAs. RNA1, 7.6 kb in size, encodes a polyprotein of 2404 amino acids that is subsequently split into coat protein and several putative nonstructural proteins such as VPg and NIb protein, which has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. RNA2, 3.6 kb in size, encodes a polyprotein of 904 amino acids containing a putative proteinase and a 73kD polypeptide [26]. For mRNA, poly(A) can increase the translation efficiency through cooperation with the 5\u2032 cap mediated by some host factors [15]. For potyviruses, poly(A) can synergisticly enhance the translation mediated by 5\u2019UTR of TEV [22] However, the influence of poly(A) on the translation of WYMV RNA is not clear and the effect of poly(A) on the minus strand synthesis from WYMV RNA also remains to be investigated.",

Total RNAs were extracted from wheat showing yellow mosaic and dwarf symptoms in fields at Shandong province, China in 2015. RT-PCR was performed to confirm the existence of WYMV (data not shown). An aliquot of the same total RNAs was used in 3\u2019RACE to clone the 3\u2032 terminal and potential poly(A) sequences. Sequencing data of four clones showed the differential polyadenylation at the 3\u2032 end of WYMV RNA1. One clone (GenBank: KU254085) lacked adenylation at the 3\u2032 end, two clones (GenBank: KU254086, KU254087) had three adenylates at the 3\u2032 end, and one clone (GenBank: KU254088) had 30 adenylates at the 3\u2032 end (Fig. 1). Although the lengths of poly(A) at the 3\u2032 ends of these four clones are different, 3\u2032 UTR sequences excluding poly(A) showed a high identity at 99.22% among the clones(Table 1). The clones also shared high identities (97.67 - 98.45%) with previously reported Chinese isolates of WYMV RNA1 (GenBank: FJ361764, FJ361765 and FJ361766) (Table 1). 3\u2019RACE was also used to analyze the 3\u2019terminal sequences of WYMV RNA2.

Compared with the mock vector, the presence of only the 5\u2032 UTR of WYMV RNA1 or RNA2 enhanced translation of Fluc to 8 fold or 10 fold, respectively (Fig. 3B and D). The presence of only the 3\u2019UTR of WYMV RNA1 had no effect on translation (Fig. 3B), while the 3\u2019UTR of WYMV RNA2 alone enhanced translation of Fluc to 5.6 fold (Fig. 3D). The positive effects of 5\u2032 UTR of WYMV RNA1 and RNA2 on Fluc translation can be further enhanced to 3.3 fold and 1.5 fold, respectively, by addition of the corresponding 3\u2019UTR (Fig. 3B and D).

These opposite effects of 3\u2032 polyadenylation may be associated with the different effects of 3\u2019UTR of RNA1 and RNA2 on translation (Fig. 3B and D).

The effects of alternative polyadenylation on replication were tested using an in vitro replication system mediated by WYMV NIb, which has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity [29]. WYMV NIb can synthesize the complementary strand from RNA1 3\u2032 UTR (3 U) or RNA2 3\u2032 terminal 192 nt (3\u2032) (Fig. 4). When 15 or 30 adenylates were added to the RNA1 3\u2032 UTR (3 U) or RNA2 3\u2032 terminal 192 nt (3\u2032), the production of complementary transcripts from the corresponding template declined greatly (Fig. 4). It is suggested that additional adenylates may greatly inhibit the synthetic efficiency of complementary strand from RNA1 or RNA2 of WYMV (Fig. 4). In addition, length of complementary strands was equal to that of the corresponding templates (Fig. 4).

Many RNAs of RNA viruses have poly(A) tails, whose length is shorter than that of mRNAs [11]. The polyadenylated tail of viral RNA has been considered a factor in RNA stability and translation and mimics the role of the stable poly(A) tail in eukaryotic mRNAs [31, 32]. In addition, variable polyadenylation at the 3\u2032 end of of some viruses\u2019 RNA, including WYMV in this study, has been detected [16,]. These variable polyadenylation tails in RNA viruses may be the direct transcriptional products from different poly(U) segments in the template strands [6, 8, 33, 34] or may undergo the degradation of the poly(A) tail by a 3\u2032 exonuclease like mRNA decay [35, 36].",

In this study, the effects of alternative polyadenylation on translation and replication of WYMV were investigated. At the translation level, the cap-independent activity or IRES activity of 5\u2032 UTR of WYMV RNA1 and RNA2 was identified using Fluc-fused constructs. The cap-independent activity of 5\u2032 UTR of WYMV RNAs can be further enhanced by corresponding 3\u2032 UTR without adenylates through potential RNA-RNA interaction (Fig. 3). This provides new evidence about the IRES activity of 5\u2032 UTR in VPg-containing RNA viruses. For picornaviruses, VPg serves as a primer to synthesize the nascent viral RNA and exists at the 5\u2032 end [37]. This VPg can be released from viral RNA though \u201cunlinkase\u201d activity via TDP2 enzyme [38]. For RNA viruses encoding VPg, viral RNAs with or without VPg can achieve effective translation [39, 40]. It is suggested that the presence of VPg at the 5\u2032 end of viral RNA is not essential for effective translation.",

However, the poly(A) tail of mRNA acts synergistically with the 5\u2032 cap to facilitate translation initiation through stabilization of the closed loop formed by the cap structure bound to the translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex [1, 41]. It is suggested that 3\u2019poly adenylation can have a negative effect on cap-independent translation. In addition, it is also implied that the cap-independent translation mediated by WYMV RNA1 or RNA2 UTRs should have different features, such as the requirement for translation initiation factors.

Previous studies on genome replication of RNA viruses were focused on characteristics of the core promoters and other cis-elements [42\u201344]. The function of polyadenylation during the synthesis of complementary strands of viral RNA was usually ignored, although many RNA viruses possess the 3\u2032 polyadenylation. In this study of WYMV, 3\u2032 terminal fragments of RNA1 or RNA2 served as good templates for the effective synthesis of their complementary strands in in vitro replication system mediated by NIb protein of WYMV, (Fig. 4). However, addition of 15 or 30 adenylates remarkably inhibited the synthesis of the complementary strands from the corresponding templates. It is suggested that 3\u2032 polyadenylation had a negative effect on the synthesis of minus strands of WYMV RNAs. In this study, effect of polyadenylation on translation and transcription of WYMV was analyzed in vitro. It is suggested that WYMV RNAs containing different length of poly(A) may be responsible for translation or replication of WYMV in vivo and ensure suitable infectivity of WYMV. However, effect of different polyadenylation on WYMV infectivity can not be tested due to shortage of WYMV infectious clone.",

If alternative polyadenylation is caused by RNA decay, as is the case with mRNA, the change of polyadenylation of viral RNAs may be responsible for the transition between translation and replication. The transition from translation to replication for RNA viruses without polyadenylation may be regulated by the structural change of cis-elements at the 3\u2032 end of viral RNA due to the binding of RdRp [20]. In summary, findings of this study on WYMV have provided insights into understanding new functions of 3\u2032 polyadenylation in addition to those on mRNAs.",
