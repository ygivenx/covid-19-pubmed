[1] Since then, the circulation of EV-D68 has been limited to individual cases and small outbreaks as reported by the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS). [2\u20136] In late summer of 2014, a large outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe respiratory illness was identified in the Midwestern United States (US). [7] Studies showed that the EV-D68 outbreak strains were associated with respiratory distress and disproportionately affected asthmatic children compared with rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV-non-EV-D68) infections, which are the most common infectious triggers of asthma. [8\u201314] Those studies, however, were mainly focused in otherwise healthy children and included limited data regarding the disease spectrum of EV-D68 in children with underlying medical conditions other than asthma.

The NCBI database was accessed on September 15, 2014 and at that time < 20% of the EVD68 2014 outbreak sequences were included. Briefly, total nucleic acid was obtained by extraction using the NucliSENS easyMag platform (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) and 4\u03bcL of the eluate was added to a 20 \u03bcL total volume reaction mixture [1XTaqMan RT-PCR mix (TaqMan RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), 1XTaqMan RT Enzyme Mix, 0.25\u03bcM of each primer: EVD68F (5\u2019-AAAACCATGACGCTAGACATGA-3\u2019) and EVD68R (5\u2019-GGCCGGAGGACTCTAT-3\u2019) and 0.9\u03bcM of probe EVD68P (5\u2019-VIC-CAAGGTGTGAAGAGTCTATT- MGB-3\u2019)]. The RT-PCR was carried out using the ABI 7500 thermocycler (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with the following running conditions: 48\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 10 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15s and 50\u00b0C for 1 min. Semiquatitative genomic EV-D68 loads were quantified using Ct values, which reflect the number of amplification cycles that are required for a positive PCR test. Thus the higher the Ct value the lower the amount of genomic EV-D68.",

[24] In addition and contrary to RV/EV-non-EV-D68 infections, co-detection of other viruses or bacteria was uncommon.

However, duration of supplemental oxygen, PICU length of stay, and overall duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in those patients compared to previously healthy or asthmatic children.

It is possible that unmeasured confounders and selection bias may have influenced the results since we only analyzed hospitalized patients, representing the more severe forms of the disease. The same type of bias applied to RV/EV-non-EV-D68 patients, which made the groups comparable. Additionally, we used a convenience sampling since not all respiratory samples were available for EV-D68 PCR testing, and thus our cohort may not be a complete representation of all patients that developed EV-D68 infection. Nevertheless, the proportion of samples that tested positive for RV/EV-non-EV-D68 during 2014 and in prior years was 40%, yet the number of cases positive for EV-D68 was significantly higher in 2014. Last, while we were able to compare children with chronic medical conditions with those that were previously healthy or had a history of asthma, we were not able to compare specific conditions such as immunodeficiency or congenital or cardiovascular conditions due to the relatively small number of patients.",

In addition, we identified EV-D68 from previous years and provided both clinical and molecular data for these isolates compared to the outbreak isolates. While a history of asthma has been demonstrated as a potential risk factor for severe disease, EV-D68 may also have a significant impact on children with other co-morbidities. These findings warrant further study and the possible implementation of routine, rapid EV-D68 diagnosis to further define the burden and circulation of EV-D68 in children.",
