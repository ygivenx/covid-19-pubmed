            "text": "Dengue is one of the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral diseases worldwide1. It is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world1,2. An estimate indicates that 390 million cases of dengue occur every year and 3.9 billion people are at a risk of infection2. The spectrum of clinical manifestations of dengue ranges from mild nonspecific febrile illness and fever, to the potentially catastrophic complications of severe dengue, as stated in the 2009 World Health Organization guidelines on dengue1. The complexity in dengue pathogenesis is an obstacle to the development of anti-viral agents. Thus, the cornerstone of management of dengue is early diagnosis and recognition of severe dengue cases, and timely fluid replacement1,3. Severe dengue is characterized by increased capillary permeability leading to extensive plasma leakage, massive bleeding and/or organ involvement that can lead to shock and death1. Antibody enhancement4, aberrant activation of immune response system along with cytokine production5, and host comorbidities6 are amongst the postulated pathogenesis for severe dengue. Cytokine cascade plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the grave form of dengue and involves complex interaction between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that cause increased vascular permeability, resulting in large fluid losses and subsequent shock5,7.",

            "text": "During the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, dengue was generally considered to be a pediatric disease8,9. However, in recent decades, advancing age has been reported to be a risk factor for patients with severe dengue, as the comorbidities associated with ageing pose a substantial risk for mortality in elderly patients10\u201312. Chronic kidney disease has been implicated in the development of severe dengue13\u201316. Thein et al., in a study of 108 patients with dengue, reported that renal disorder increased odds of death in adults17. Kuo et al. reported that patients with chronic kidney disease had a higher mortality rate than those without chronic kidney disease13. In a study of 304 adults with dengue, chronic renal disease was found to be a risk factor that contributes to the development of acute kidney injury, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality of the affected patients18. Wong et al. found that end stage renal disease (ESRD) is a risk factor for acute respiratory failure in dengue affected adults19. ESRD is also an important clinical predictor of gastrointestinal bleeding in adult patients with dengue20. In fact, patients with ESRD are more susceptible to infections (such as bacterial sepsis) with poor clinical outcomes compared with the general population21. In spite of ESRD being an increasingly common disease, there is lack of enough data on the immune pathogenesis in ESRD patients affected by dengue. Thus, thorough investigation is urgently required for the better understanding of immune responses in dengue-affected ESRD patients. In the present study, we aim to explore the sequential immunological reactions and viral load in vitro by investigating dengue virus-infected mononuclear cells of adults with ESRD, which would eventually make it possible to target interventions for an improved treatment plan for dengue infection.",

In the present study, eleven immune mediators and viral load Ct values were measured in DENV2-infected mononuclear cells of adults with ESRD, and in healthy participants. Uremic itself presents a complex multidimensional inflammatory condition31. Previous studies have shown that T lymphocytes from ESRD patients are dysregulated and the plasma IL-18, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and C-reactive protein concentrations were significantly higher in ESRD patients than those pre-dialysis controls31. In our series, apart from high levels of GM-CSF and IL-2 that were observed at 6 h post-infection, impaired production of immune mediators was observed at a later stage post-infection in the ESRD group. This finding is potentially valuable for understanding of the basis of immunopathology reactions and provides new insight in the management of ESRD patients with dengue virus infection.",

GM-CSF has been reported to increase significantly in patients with severe dengue as compared mild dengue33. IL-2 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine in determining the activation of T-helper 1 response to stimulate cell-mediated immunity34. Kurane et al. in a study of 69 children showed that the level of IL-2 was highest one day before defervescence in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever35. Although GM-CSF and IL-2 were expressed in higher concentrations at 6 h post-infection in ESRD group, the production of a large number of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines, including IL-8, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1b, and IL-10 was markedly decreased.

This change is most likely due to effects of biological mediators as a consequence of complex interactions between dengue virus and host innate and adaptive immune responses4,5,7. For example, increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptors as well as VEGF have been reported in dengue hemorrhagic fever cases36,37. IL-10, having anti-inflammatory properties counter-regulates the cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and it has been reported to correlate with disease severity38 Remarkable, the results of the present study showed a significant impairment of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1b expression at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. VEGF levels at 24 h and 48 h, and GM-CSF levels at 48 h and 72 h were also reported to be low in ESRD group. Impaired cytokines/chemokines expression also has been found in ESRD without diabetes group as well. Our results have been somewhat inconsistent with the reported overwhelming immune activation that is associated with dengue disease severity5,7; however, our findings clearly reflect the impairment of immune responses in vitro study of DENV2-infected mononuclear cells in ESRD patients. Uremia per se can also alter the immune system in ESRD patients39. The complete blood count is not performed in our series. Previous studies, however, have shown that monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells of ESRD patients have impaired endocytosis and maturation40. Lisowska et al. reported that ESRD patients have lower percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B cells in peripheral blood41. In fact, several factors influence immunity in ESRD patients, such as uremic toxin, malnutrition, chronic inflammation, and therapeutic dialysis39\u201342. In this regard, our findings and previous reports indicate that ESRD patients have immune dysregulation with impaired expression of immune mediators in case of dengue virus infection.",

The relationship between the dengue viral load and the severity of disease is still controversial45,46. Murgue et al. had reported that high levels of viral load might contribute to the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever45. In another study of 128 confirmed adult dengue cases, Chen et al. found that viral load was not significantly different between dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever patients46. Further studies are needed to determine the role of viral load in the pathogenesis of severe dengue in ESRD patients.",
