LNA-MGB (Supplementary Information 1, Fig. S1.1, Panels a\u2013c), were selected to test the opposite dual-probe qPCR assay. The tandem orientations were investigated in three probe combinations: 1. simple-MGB, 2. simple-LNA, and 3. LNA-MGB (Supplementary Information 2, Fig. S2.1, Panels a\u2013c). Dilution and calibration curves covering a quantitative range of six magnitudes (from 1e2 to 1e7 NA standard copies per \u03bcl of template), were prepared to evaluate the reaction parameters. The dilution curves showed a parallel course for the particular dual-probe and the corresponding single-probe subsets in the early exponential phase of amplification. This resulted in highly similar Cq values, supported by low standard deviation (SD) across the entire dilution gradient, irrespective of the combination of the hydrolysis probe modifications or the tested orientations thereof. The close Cq values were also reflected in the parallel and overlapping calibration curves, where the corresponding assays had comparable amplification efficiencies (Fig. 4, Panels a\u2013c and Supplementary Information 1, Fig. S1.2, Panels a\u2013c, and Supplementary Information 2, Fig. S2.2, Panels a\u2013c). Similarly, the \u0394Cq straight lines showed parallel courses, with the slope values significantly below the 0.1 threshold (Fig. 4, Panels d\u2013f and Supplementary Information 1, Fig. S1.2, Panels d\u2013f and Supplementary Information 2, Fig. S2.2, Panels d\u2013f), again suggesting that the dual-probe and the corresponding single-probe TaqMan assays have comparable efficiencies. One slight deviation in the data was observed. In particular, the opposite MGB-A+LNA-B assay (Supplementary Information 1, Fig. S1.2, Panel c) showed slightly lower efficiency than the corresponding MGB-A subset. This was also reflected in the elevated \u0394Cq slope of 0.157 (Supplementary Information 1, Fig. S1.2, Panel f), which, though small, is still higher than the 0.1 threshold. However, the observed deviation was attributed to experimental imperfections and did not contradict the general findings of the study.",

The first of these mutations was located at the extreme 5\u2032 end, suggesting possible interference with hydrolysis. The second change was slightly eccentric and shifted towards the 3\u2032 end.

Hence, even if the specific amplicons are generated, the assays remain non-fluorescent, thus suggesting no amplification in a TaqMan qPCR setting. Including a second probe in the assay may therefore compensate for the deficiency of the first one and restore the assay inclusivity. There are several options for how to integrate the second probe into the TaqMan qPCR assay. The probes can bind to the complementary amplicon strand or consecutively downstream of one of the primers. Further, they can be simple or additionally modified to increase the melting temperature. Finally, the probes can hold identical or different fluorescent labels.",

Specifically, we did not find as significant improvement in Cq and efficiency values of the dual-probe assays across our data set as reported by Yip and colleagues15. However, the theory of qPCR does not suggest significant improvements in these parameters either. In tandem orientations, the two probes bind to one of the DNA template strands. Assuming that the tandem-probe and the corresponding single-probe assays exhibit comparable efficiencies, the recognised template amount in each cycle is identical, i.e. 50%, since in both cases the probe binding and hydrolysis take place upon a single strand of a double-strand template. Hence, all the assays would have identical Cq values and the differences would only be reflected in the higher fluorescence yield of the tandem-probe assays. On the contrary, a dual-probe assay with opposite probe configuration simultaneously detects both strands of the template during each single cycle. Indeed, there is a 2-fold difference between the opposite and tandem-probe assays, which would theoretically yield lower Cq values. Nevertheless, the theory further suggests that if a qPCR is 100% efficient, the 2-fold measurements differ by one cycle between the means24. However, in reality, the amplification efficiency is never absolute, and therefore, the expected one cycle difference between the 2-fold dilutions is reduced. In addition, it is burdened with higher experimental variations25. Hence, the Cq improving-effect of the second probe in opposite orientation is difficult to distinguish. In summary, there is no obvious theoretical explanation for the observed contradictions. Instead, it seems that the Cq and reaction efficiency improvements observed by Yip and colleagues15 resulted from sequence mismatches in the first probe and the compensatory effect of the second one. This option was not further investigated.",

To meet this requirement, the primers and the probes have to be selected at the most conserved regions of the targeted genome. Optionally, evolutionarily conserved regions are identified by multiple sequence alignment (MSA), including sequences from a broad time period and from different geographic regions and host species. However, the more diverse the sequence collection of the MSA, the less abundant the conserved positions are. So, once the primers have been selected, the MSA may not provide additional evolutionarily conserved positions suitable for probe selection. The advancement of the dual-probe TaqMan strategy is to enable probe selection at semi-conserved motifs, where the two probes may complement or overlap one another in sequence inclusivity. This might facilitate the development of novel screening assays. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that the opposite dual-probe system is inherently predisposed towards lower Cq values and should be the preferred choice during assay design.",

Additional disadvantages are the increased reaction cost and possibly an extra pipetting step during the master mix preparation.
