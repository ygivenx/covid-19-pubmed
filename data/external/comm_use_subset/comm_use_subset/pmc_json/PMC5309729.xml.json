Since the infection spread to other regions through patients who moved to hospitals in other locations, people were also concerned about the spread of the infection to their communities. As the fear of visiting hospitals and concerns about the possibility of transmission to communities emerged, the outbreak resulted in a larger social impact than the H1N1 influenza outbreak that resulted in the infection of 15,160 people and 260 deaths in 2009.",

In contrast, only a few studies have been conducted to assess the perception of community residents following the recent MERS outbreak. Similar studies, although limited, have been performed on people that were quarantined or medical staffs, following the MERS outbreak [12,13]. Thus, in this study, we investigated perceived infection sensitivity among community residents and the level of preventive behaviors practiced during the 2015 outbreak of MERS in Korea. We also identified the characteristics of groups with high or low level of perceived sensitivity, by which we aimed to reveal the effect of perceived infection sensitivity on preventive behaviors.",

This was relatively higher than that of the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 conducted with community residents, in which responses to the same questions were concerns about infection (54.6%), concerns about death (35.4%), concerns about socioeconomic chaos (36.9%), and overall concerns (39.7%) [10]. In particular, concerns about social chaos or overall concerns, rather than concerns about infection or death, were higher by about 30% compared to those in the past H1N1 influenza outbreak. It is possible that respondents in this study perceived risks to be much closer because outbreak-related informations were rapidly spread through media such as the internet, along with their distrust of the government due to their inappropriate early countermeasures. The rates of practice of guidelines for prevention of the infection were 89.8% for frequent hand washing, 73.2% for not touching the face with hands, 72.4% for covering while coughing and 62.8% for avoiding places where there are many people, which were higher by 15 to 30% than those (72.2, 56.0, 35.8, and 31.6%, respectively) in the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 [10]. On the other hand, response rates for policy credibility were 21.8% for preventive guidelines and the notification policy of the government, 28.7% for the policy on information delivery through mass media and 15.6% for the overall countermeasure policy of the government, which were lower by about over 10 to 20% than those (44.5, 45.7, and 24.0%, respectively) in the H1N1l influenza outbreak in 2009 [10].",

It seems that the perception that existing negative health conditions cause an increase in susceptibility to infectious disease holds true, as there was actually increased infection sensitivity. For outbreak-related characteristics, those who were subjects of quarantine or monitoring or those who experienced respiratory symptoms during the outbreak period had higher infection sensitivity, similar to previous results [7]. The Pyeongtaek area, the origin of the outbreak, tended to more residents belonging to the non-sensitive group. It might be due to the relief from the heightened fearful situation since the survey was conducted after two months of the outbreak, or a reduction of the fear of the possibility of infection, because they were finally not infected even during the actual onset of the outbreak.",

Consistent with results of this study, previous studies reported that as participants thought that they were more susceptible to the disease, as the corresponding disease was more severe, and as the disease was suspected to be more difficult to treat, the chances of them following guidelines were higher [5,7]. In an investigation of the H1N1 influenza outbreak of Korea in 2009, with 4,606 community residents, there were more positive health behaviors such as more frequent hand washing as H1N1-related anxiety became higher (\u03b2=1.516 for moderate and 4.103 for high compared to low, both with p<0.001).

Communication strategies could be also developed for each group to improve the awareness of the health threat and the practice of recommended preventive behaviors. For example, vulnerable families with a low risk perception on the infection could receive tailored information to increase the awareness and perceived severity of the infection and to emphasize their practice of preventive behaviors.

While perceived infection sensitivity also functions as a factor to increase the practice of preventive behaviors, there was no or little correlation between policy credibility and infection sensitivity in this study.
