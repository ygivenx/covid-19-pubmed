            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) arises from the mutation of a gene encoding the functional protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which is involved in the production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus.[1] The CFTR protein plays important role in mucosal surfaces, and its dysfunction usually gives rise to thicker secretion of glands, therefore results in obstruction of exocrine glands all over the body. CF is a multisystem disease and influences many body parts, such as lung, pancrea, liver, kidney, and intestine, among which lung is most heavily affected. It is considered one of the most widespread genetic disorders shortening human life expectancy. CF is the most common lethal genetic disease in the people of Northern European and it is the least common in African and Asian population.[2,3] The most typical symptoms of CF are chronic pulmonary obstruction, pancreatic dysfunction, and abnormal increased level of electrolytes (i.e., sodium and fluorine) in sweat. The long-term results of CF include recurrent pulmonary infection, dyspnea, and mucous sputum. The other CF complications are sinus infection, poor growth, fatty stool, clubbed-fingers, and male infertility. Although CF patients are living longer thanks to the improvements in management of airway infections, it is still incurable, and the extra-pulmonary complications from CF, such as CF-related diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis, depression, and arthropathy, are becoming increasing threats.",

Although typically only a few species are associated with chronic airway infections in CF, along with the improved treatments of infections, new species associated with CF has emerged, and the total microbes should be took into account as a whole. After infections, numerous species in lung form a microbial community, and the common-used antibiotic treatment bring a selective process, leading to significant changes of the composition of community. From an ecologist's view, the lung infected by microbes could be seen an ecosystem colonized by microbes, where the interactions between individuals or species and between microbes and environment play an important role. Therefore, variant ecological viewpoints and methods could be used to study the lung microbial community and its changes.",

            "text": "One core topic of community ecology is the mechanism of community assembly and diversity maintenance, which is our choice to revealing the influence of CF on lung microbial community in this study. Traditionally, there are 2 major theories for explaining the mechanism, the niche theory emphasizing the deterministic factors and the neutral theory emphasizing the stochastic factors. The Niche theory has dominated in this field for a long time till Hubbell et al[24] proposed the neutral theory, which is characterized by the assumption that individuals from 1 community composed of different species at the same trophic level are completely equal, species migrate randomly, and the number of species depends on the balance between extinction and immigration or new species formation.[25\u201327] The neutral theory combines neutrality, stochasticity, sampling and dispersal, and provides a null model to test the neutrality of a community and a simple mechanistic explanation of the species abundance distributions (SAD), based on which it is possible to decide, accept, or reject specific hypothesis regarding the mechanism underlying community assembly and diversity maintenance. For these merits, neutral theory has been widely adopted in macroecology area for a long time,[28,29] and been an effective tool in microecology area recently thanks to the development of the next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology.[30\u201340] A previous study has revealed that in the lungs of healthy individuals, neutral processes override selective processes, indicating the species in lungs are neutrally distributed.[36] However, in CF patients, especially those who have pulmonary exacerbation, the lung microbial community could be totally different due to altered microenvironment. After antibiotic treatments, the lung microbial communities of CF patients are expected to restore back to the original healthy state as far as possible. Therefore, in this study, our aim is to understand whether or not the neutral process would dominate in the lung microbial community of CF patient, and whether antibiotic treatments could revert it to another state. To answer these questions, we apply 2 widely used sampling models proposed by Ewens [41] and Etienne [42] for testing Hubbell neutral theory to reanalyze the dataset from Fodor et al's[43] study.",

Using the Etienne formulae, 2 samples in End-of-treatment Group cannot be calculated because there are too few individuals and species. In addition, the immigrate rate m of most samples in the results of Etienne formula is very close to 1, implying that Ewens and Etienne sampling formulae perform similarly for this dataset. Therefore, we chose the results of Ewens formula for the statistical analysis.

Immigration from upper airway is an important driver shaping the community, and even slight change in lung caused by lungs diseases or external environmental factors may bring significant change in lung microbial community. While it is hard to predict precisely how the changes in lungs influence the lung microbial community, plenty of studies have shown such changes. For instance, Yu et al[22] reported that the lung tissue microbiota showed increased alpha diversity with environmental exposures such as air particulates, residence in high population density areas, and pack-years of tobacco smoking. Krishna et al[23] showed the presence of diverse opportunistic pathogenic microbiota in TB patients increased the complexity and diversity of sputum microbiota. Paganin et al[20] detected that changes of microbial community in CF airway were relevant to a severe decline of lung function. Price et al[4] found that the community diversity cannot distinguish the clinical stages in CF. Cuthbertson et al[21] suggested that core microbiota members did not have significant negative impact on the CFPE. Though the changes in composition of microbial community have been demonstrated widely, few studies have shed light on the key question: how is the force shaping lung microbial community affected by the alterations in lung?",

To test if the SAD curves of a certain community fit the prediction of neutral theory is an effective and simple way to investigate the mechanisms of community assembly preliminarily. Not only in macroecology area, this method has been used in microecology area. Arvind et al[21,36] demonstrated that, in healthy lungs, the composition of microbial communities satisfied the predictions of neutral model, and no one specie deviated from the model expectations. Their results suggest that the neutral process is the main force shaping the healthy lung microbial community. In the microbial community of healthy lung, most invading microbes are eliminated via innate immune mechanisms, and the remaining ones may have strong enough resistance against the environmental factors that can remove them. Therefore all the remaining species in the community may be ecologically equal (i.e., they have equal chance to immigrate, growth, and death). In the microbial community of CF patient, however, things have changed. Most importantly, the normal innate immune mechanism of lung has changed due to the mutations in CFTR, resulting in significant alterations in the microenvironment of lung. The change of composition of lung community is not evitable, and such change may be driven by the environmental factors or certain species.[45] This raises a question: in the CF patient, whether or not the neutral process is still the dominant force that shapes the lung microbial community? In our study, we used Ewens and Etienne sampling formulae to test if the lung microbial communities in CF patients (Exacerbation Group) satisfied the predictions of neutral theory, and found no one sample satisfied the predictions with both methods, suggesting that, unlike the healthy lung, the assembly of lung microbial communities in CF patients may not be dominated by neutral process any more. This result suggests that CF would change not only the composition, but also the assembly mechanism of lung microbial community.",

Treatments for CF mainly include antibiotics along with pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat-soluble vitamin supplement, or lung transplantation. Usually, patients would be subjected to repeat rounds of antibiotics for controlling the infections. The lung microbial communities may have likely evolved and adapted in response to antibiotic treatments, which may lead very different compositions of microbial communities. In Fodor et al's study, they surprisingly found that most patients were treated for 2 weeks with a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the lung microbial community composition did not have substantively change. Because although small decrease was detected in richness after antibiotic treatments, the changes occur in only taxa with low relative abundance and the most abundant taxa in this cohort showed little change in response to antibiotics. The observation may result from the fact that antibiotic resistance is widespread throughout plenty of abundant species. In our study, similar result was detected by comparing the diversity parameter \u03b8 between End-of-treatment Group and Exacerbation Group. We found that while the significant was detected between End-of-treatment and Exacerbation Group, the mean value of \u03b8 in End-of-treatment is slightly lower than Exacerbation Group, and the P value is very close to.05, which indicates that the significance is not so strong. This result raises another key question: after antibiotic treatment, whether or not the mechanism of assembly of lung microbial community would change back to the state in healthy lung, which is dominated by neutral process. We tested the neutrality in the samples from CF patients who have received 2 weeks treatments of antibiotic (End-of-treatment Group) with Ewens and Etienne sampling formulae, and found that no one satisfied the predictions of neutral theory, indicating that the antibiotic treatment may not change the mechanism of assembly of lung microbial community back to the neutral process dominating state.",

First, the chosen models treat the neutral- and niche-driven community as a dichotomy, which may not be rigorous enough as there may be a mediacy between them.

Second, although SAD-fitting models have been the most widely used methods for investigating the community assembly, which is used in our study as well, they have limitations (e.g., this method can hardly distinguish contributions of sampling effects and other more ecologically based effects).[50,51] Further studies could try to use models that considering SAD with other information simultaneously (e.g., identity of species and phylogenetic information) to understand the assembly mechanism of the lung microbial community related to CF better.",
