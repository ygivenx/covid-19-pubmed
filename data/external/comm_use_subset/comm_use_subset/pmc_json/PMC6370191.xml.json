Today, more than half of the world\u2019s population lives in cities. International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that energy-related carbon emissions in cities would grow by 1.8% annual, with the proportion of carbon emissions in cities rising from 71% to 76% during 2006 to 2030[7]. Therefore, cities are the main sources of carbon emissions throughout the world. Cities are also the major components in the implementation of carbon emissions mitigation measures [8]. City-based climate works are becoming popular, such as the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group [9]. Examining and understanding the features and drivers of carbon emissions in cities is considered a fundamental step for implementing \u201clow carbon city\u201d strategies and actions.",

Accompanying its rapid urbanization and industrialization, energy consumption and carbon emissions are increasing accordingly, aiming to meet the increased demands for infrastructure and services [10, 11]. China\u2019s total CO2 emission has increased rapidly from 4085.6 million tonnes in 2003 to 9534.2 million tonnes in 2013 [12]. China has become one of the world\u2019s largest energy consumer and carbon emitter [13, 14], accounting for one-quarter of all global carbon emissions [15]. Tackling climate change and addressing carbon mitigation, China promised to stabilize carbon emissions by 2030 in the \u201c2014 U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate Change\u201d [16, 17]. China proposed in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020) that, per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), energy consumption and CO2 emission should be reduced by 15% and 18% in 2020, respectively, compared with the 2015 levels [18]. Among carbon emissions sources in China, approximately 85% of emissions are contributed by energy consumption in cities, which is much higher than that experienced in the U.S. (80%) or in the EU (69%) [19, 20]. Consequently, it is particularly important to understand China\u2019s carbon emissions in cities, and provide city-based evidence for energy conservation and emission mitigation actions.",

            "text": "Under such a circumstance, a vast body of studies has been conducted by domestic and foreign scholars to uncover the main drivers for China\u2019s increasing carbon emissions in cities. As mentioned in Table 1, current research on carbon emissions in cities are mainly focusing on two research strands. The first strand of research focuses on the city-level total carbon accounting. Accurate accounting is crucial for efforts to curb the carbon rise. Previous studies on city-level total carbon accounting can be classified into 3 scopes [21\u201323]: Scope 1 \u2013the direct carbon emissions produced by fossil fuel combustion and industrial process occurring within the city boundary; Scope 2 \u2013the indirect carbon emissions related to imported electricity, steam and heating out of the city boundary; Scope 3 \u2013the transferred carbon emissions embodied in imported/exported products and services out of the city boundary. Scope 1 and Scope 2 are calculated mainly based on the \u201cUrban Emissions Inventory\u201d as the product of activity sector and fuel data bases and appropriate emission factors. Especially, the emission factors for calculating Scope 2 emissions needs to be considered by the corresponding regional power supply system [21]. Scope 3 is calculated from the transferred carbon emissions embodied in imported/exported products and services in order to tackle the issue of emission leakage, which is mainly based on the environmentally extended Input-output (IO) models and hybrid Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. Thus the sources of data for accounting emissions embodied in imports and exports are critical for Scope 3 [24]. However, current emissions reduction targets are mainly based on Scope 1 emissions and without fully considering Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. In fact, findings of previous studies indicated that developed regions outsourced more emissions to other regions at the global [25], national [26], and local [27] scales. Therefore, comprehensive inventory and specific boundary are the basis for city-level carbon emissions accounting, as well as local emission mitigation strategies [28].",

Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) and Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA)) and regression method (e. g. Stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model) are the most commonly applied methods for the scientific evaluation and quantitative analysis of factors influencing city-level carbon emissions, especially the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method based on the IDA framework. As shown in Table 1, the SDA method based on the IO technique applied in the city-level driving factors and influencing mechanisms research in China were mainly focused on the four municipalities (i. e. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing), because of the available IO data base compiled by the Municipality Bureau of Statistics. In other words, the IO data sources were lacking in other provincial capital cities and medium-sized cities in China. Consequently, the IDA methods were used more frequently than the SDA methods based on IO technique [59\u201362], owing to its applicability in which each model can be applied to any available data at any aggregation level in a period-wise or time-series manner [63\u201365], where the preferred one in the LMDI [66\u201373]. By means of LMDI method, Wang et al. [46] investigated the main driver for industrial carbon emissions in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic band from 1996 to 2010, and the results showed that economic output and energy intensity were both the most important influencing factors. Wang et al. [42] decomposed the influencing factors of residential carbon emissions in Beijing and found that the rising per capita GDP and the declining energy intensity contributed the most to emissions changes during 2000 to 2010. Similar results, conducted by Wang et al. [54], can also be found in Suzhou city. Zhao et al. [49] decomposed the main drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai and found that industrial output, energy intensity, energy and industrial structure were major determinants for emissions changes. Shao et al. [50] adopted an extended LMDI method and investigated the techno-economic drivers for industrial carbon emissions in Shanghai, and the results showed that industrial output scale was mainly responsible for emission increments while industrial structure adjustment, R&D intensity, and energy intensity were most significant factors in mitigating emissions.

[51] performed a multi-sectoral decomposition analysis of city-level greenhouse gas emissions in Tianjin from 2001 to 2009, including the agricultural, industrial, transportation, commercial and other sectors, and the results showed that economic growth was the most important driver for emissions increments while energy efficiency was primarily responsible for emissions reductions. Hopefully, previous studies about driving factors and influencing mechanisms of city-level carbon emissions performed on China's megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai etc., have made great contributions to the realization of regional low-carbon road map. But, the previous LMDI studies mainly focused on the economic growth effect, the energy intensity effect, the population size effect, and the technology progress effect influencing the change of carbon emissions. It fails to distinguish the effects of economic structure, population structure, and energy structure on the change of carbon emissions. In fact, the strongest factors that offset China\u2019s energy consumption and carbon emissions have shifted from efficiency gains to structural changes [74, 75]. Structural indicators combined with other traditional and emerging factors should also be deeply considered and investigated in China\u2019s regional energy and carbon researches, which may perform different influencing mechanism in different regions during different development stages.",

Guangzhou is the provincial capital of Guangdong province, the most developed coastal region in the southeast of China (Fig 1).

However, there are accounting discrepancies between the different types of methods [21]. Based on China\u2019s energy statistic and the reference approach of IPCC Guideline for National Greenhouse gas Emission Inventories, there are mainly three approach to account, i. e. primary energy consumption (e. g. coal, oil, natural gas, and renewables) [63], final energy consumption (e. g. coal, oil, natural gas, renewables, and electricity/heating) [61, 62], and total energy consumption from the \u201cEnergy Balance Table\u201d including the aggregate summary of energy production, energy transformation and final consumption [76, 77]. Compared with the primary energy consumption accounting and the final energy consumption accounting, apparent energy consumption data [78, 79] from the comprehensive energy balance table was recommended for this study. As shown in the Table 3, the comprehensive energy balance table is mainly based on three modules, namely, 1) total energy available for local consumption as a result of interprovincial and international energy trades, 2) input-output of energy conversion transformation for thermal power, heating, coking, petroleum refining, and gas production, 3) final consumption due to primary industry, secondary industry, tertiary industry, and residential consumption. Primary industry, namely, agriculture, mainly includes farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. Secondary industry includes manufacturing industries and construction industry. Tertiary industry includes transportation, storage, post and telecommunication services, wholesale, retail trade and catering services, and other service sectors.",

However, there were various growth trends existing in the main 9 types of energy sources over the research period. The leading energy in Guangzhou over the whole research period is still coal (raw coal plus coke), which increased from 14.494 million tce in 2003 to 22.993 million tce in 2011, then decreased to 20.198 million tce in 2013. Oil products such as gasoline and diesel oil also play an important role in Guangzhou\u2019s energy consumption system. Gasoline and diesel oil had an overall growing trend, which grew from 3.636 million tce in 2003 to 16.099 million tce in 2013. In addition, the most important features of energy consumption structure in Guangzhou, is the electricity consumption. The electricity consumption as shown in Fig 2, is not the thermal power or renewable energy power generated in Guangzhou, which represented the imported electricity from the neighbors of Guangdong province\u2014Yunnan province, Guizhou province, and Guangxi province etc. The imported electricity was calculated from the comprehensive energy balance table in Guangzhou. The imported electricity increased rapidly from 0.173 million tce in 2003 to 13.118 million tce in 2013, which played an important role in the energy consumption system in Guangzhou. As shown in Fig 2, there was a sharply increase in the imported electricity in Guangzhou after 2009. The rapid increase in the imported electricity resulted in the sluggish and even decrease in fossil energy consumption in Guangzhou to a great extent in recent years. In fact, the increased imported electricity consumed in Guangzhou was benefited by the \u201cWest-East electricity transmission project\u201d [84] conducting by China\u2019s central government after 2000. The similar condition was familiar in other mega cities in China such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin etc [14].",

Total energy-related carbon emissions mainly include two parts, namely, carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion and out of the boundary embodied in the imported electricity (Fig 3). Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity need to be calculated by considering the total amount of imported electricity and the corresponding emissions factor of power generation [56]. As for China\u2019s power supply system, electricity is supplied by the main six regional grids consisting of North China Grid, Northeast China Grid, East China Grid, Central China Grid, Northwest China Grid, and South China Grid. Guangzhou city is supplied by the South China Grid which covered Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. According to the \u201cWest-East electricity transmission project\u201d, the southern route of this project refers to transmitting Guizhou\u2019s thermal power and Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi\u2019s hydropower to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau [84]. At present, Guangdong\u2019s imported electricity was mainly from Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. More than 60 percent of the cross-province electricity trades were thermal power, and less than 40 percent were hydropower, based on our estimation according to the relevant government documents (e. g. The 12th\nfive-year plan for energy development in Guangdong province [85], and the 12th\nfive-year plan for power industry development in Guizhou province [86]). The corresponding emissions factor of power generation in South China Grid can be found in the baseline emission factors for China's regional grid announced by the National Development and Reform Commission.",

During the first stage, carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion increased rapidly from 15.243 million tons in 2003 to 26.822 million tons in 2009 with an annual growth rate of 8.41%. Raw coal is still the biggest contributor to the total carbon emissions, which was followed by diesel oil, gasoline, and fuel oil. But the share of raw coal contributing to the total emissions has decreased dramatically from 63.69% in 2003 to 52.45% in 2009. During the same period, carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity increased from 0.057 million tons in 2003 to 1.080 million tons in 2009. And the share of imported electricity accounting for the total emissions has decreased from 0.37% in 2003 to 3.87% in 2009. Imported electricity has played an important but relatively minor effect on the total carbon emissions in Guangzhou during this period. During the second stage, carbon emissions generated in the boundary from fossil fuel combustion increased slowly from 29.130 million tons in 2010 to 30.565 million tons in 2013 with an annual growth rate of 1.21%, and even decreased from 30.693 million tons in 2011 to 29.811 million tons in 2012. Raw coal is still the biggest contributor to the total carbon emissions during this period. In such a case, Guangzhou perfectly completed the energy saving and emission reduction targets (i. e. the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions per unit GDP decreased by 16% and 17% during the 12th five-year plan period, respectively.), which were issued by the central government and performed by the local government. But in fact, carbon emissions mitigation in the boundary mainly benefited from contributions of the imported electricity from the neighbors Guizhou and Yunnan provinces via the cross-province electricity trades. During the same period, carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity dramatically increased 3.236 million tons in 2010 to 4.379 million tons in 2013. Rapidly increasing carbon emissions embodied in imported electricity indicated that there were large amounts of fossil energy were burned for power. Final products-thermal power was consumed in Guangzhou, while carbon emissions were discharged in its neighbor producers. If these carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity were allocated to the final consumer, Guangzhou would have paid more efforts and implemented more strict mitigation measures to achieve its energy saving and emission reduction targets.",

The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase, bringing in a 5.43 million tons increase, accounting for 86.34% of the total industrial carbon emissions changes, which was followed by the energy intensity effect of service (e-effect-Service), the carbon intensity effect of service (f-effect-Service), and the economic structure effect (s-effect). In order to achieve the basic standards of modernization (i. e. per capita GDP is more than 5000 U.S. dollar, and the third industry added value accounted for more than 50% of GDP etc.), Guangzhou paid more efforts to foster the three pillar industries (i. e. electronic information manufacturing industry, automobile industry, and petrochemical industry) and accelerate the development of the third industry (i. e. transportation industry and logistics industry).

The population effect (p-effect) changed from negative to positive during 2005 to 2010. The total population increased from 9.75 million in 2006 to 12.71 million in 2010, which played the second important role in the carbon emissions growth. The energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) played the most two important roles in curbing carbon emissions growth, resulting in 4.32 million tons and 3.23 million tons decrease, accounting for 64.96% and 48.62% of the total industrial carbon emissions changes in absolute value, which was followed by the carbon intensity effect of service (f-effect-Service), and the economic structure effect (s-effect). The adjustment of industrial structure in Guangzhou was mainly focused on upgrading the traditional advantage industries (i. e. iron and steel, shipbuilding, machinery and equipment, electricity, paper, and textile etc.) and fostering the new and high technology industries (i. e. Software, new material, new energy, and digital industry etc.), announced in the 11th\nfive-year plan for socioeconomic development in Guangzhou. The proportion of production industry decreased from 35.77% in 2005 to 33.91% in 2010. The energy intensity of production decreased from 0.117 tce/thousand Yuan in 2005 to 0.090 tce/thousand Yuan in 2010. The carbon intensity of production sharply decreased from 0.758 in 2005 to 0.625 in 2010. It indicates that the adjustment of industrial structure achieved effectively to curb carbon emissions during this period.",
