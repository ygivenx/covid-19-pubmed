Heightened activity of proteinases disrupt the pericellular junctions of the endothelium and allow for migration of peripheral immune cells into the damaged brain parenchyma; this process inherently compromises the integrity of the BBB and increases the risk of edema and hemorrhagic transformation1, 2. By nature, administration of thrombolytic therapies can exacerbate the risk of such adverse events and worsen outcome in patients who develop complications3\u20135. Early identification of patients who are at risk for the development of BBB complications can inform acute clinical decisions regarding thrombolytic intervention, and ultimately improve clinical management and patient outcome6. Unfortunately, the diagnostic tools presently available to clinicians to identify patients at risk for post-stroke BBB complications are limited.",

The intact BBB is largely impermeable to Gd-DTPA, thus, hyperintense post-contrast enhancement of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is indicative of BBB disruption7. Such post-contrast enhancement has been labeled as hyperintense acute reperfusion injury marker (HARM)8, and has been shown to be predictive of post-stroke edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation8, 9. While perfusion-weighted imaging can yield valuable diagnostic information which can be used to guide clinical care decisions6, 10, 11, a large number of healthcare facilities lack the capacity to perform MRI during acute triage12. As a result, there has been a push for the identification of peripheral blood biomarkers which can provide similar insight regarding the status of the BBB during the acute phase of care.",

Ideally, to be clinically useful, such transcriptional biomarkers would be specific to stroke pathology. Our group recently identified a panel of 16 genes (ACSL1, AKAP7, APOBEC3A, ARG1, CA4, CCR7, CRISPLD2, CSPG2, FCGR3B, FOLR3, IQGAP1, LY96, MMP9, ORM1, PADI4, S100A12) which exhibit stroke-specific differential regulation in peripheral whole blood14.

Genes were then ranked based on the absolute strength of relationship between their expression levels and those of AKAP7. We theorized that genes which were strongly co-expressed with AKAP7 would likely be mechanistically related. ITGA3, which encodes a cellular adhesion molecule known as integrin alpha 3 (ITGA3), was the only gene in the dataset whose expression levels were significantly correlated with those of AKAP7 (Fig. 3A), exhibiting a robust positive association (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, like AKAP7, early expression levels of ITAG3 at were positively associated with the development of post-stroke severe HARM in a post-hoc logistic regression analysis controlling for age, dyslipidemia, and rtPA (p = 0.045*, Odds ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.0\u201328.4).

In order to determine which AKAP7 splice variants were responsible for the coregulatory relationship we observed with ITGA3, we first aimed to identify which AKAP7 splice variants are expressed in the peripheral immune system. Primers specific to each established and predicated splice variant were designed based on variant-specific priming sites (Fig. 4A) and RT-PCR was used to probe for the presence of expression in peripheral whole blood samples obtained from two stroke patients and two healthy subjects. PCR products were detected for all tested AKAP7 splice variants in all samples (Fig. 4B), providing direct evidence that all established and previously bioinformatically predicted AKAP7 splice variants are expressed in the peripheral immune system. Where possible, a second set of primers was used to validate the expression of previously predicted variants (Supplementary Figure 1A).\n",

In this second cohort of patients, early expression levels of AKAP7\u03b1, AKAP7\u03b2, and AKAP7\u03b3 exhibited significant positive correlations with expression levels of ITGA3 (Fig. 5A\u2013C). Interestingly, all previously predicted AKAP7 splice variants displayed inversely related expression levels with regards to ITGA3 (Fig. 5D\u2013H) as well as the established AKAP7 splice variants (Supplementary Figure 2). These data suggest that the strong positive relationship between AKAP7 and ITGA3 expression observed in the first cohort of patients was primarily driven by AKAP7\u03b1, AKAP7\u03b2, and AKAP7\u03b3. This is feasible due to the fact that the previously predicted AKAP7 splice variants appeared to be expressed at much lower levels than those of the established splice variants, as indicated by higher CT values in qRT-PCR (data not shown) and the production of significantly less PCR product in standard RT-PCR when using primers designed for co-amplification (Supplementary Figure 1B). Interestingly, AKAP7\u03b1, AKAP7\u03b2, and AKAP7\u03b3 all encode for scaffolding proteins with the ability to bind PKA20, while the remaining splice variants are predicted to undergo non-sense mediated decay or generate scaffolding proteins which lack a PKA binding domain (Supplementary Figure 3). Collectively, the data validate the relationship between ITGA3 and AKAP7 observed in the discovery cohort, and suggest dynamic regulation between the PKA-binding and non-PKA-binding AKAP7 variants. Thus, the ratio between the expression levels of these splice variants may be more diagnostically robust than the expression levels of total AKAP7 alone.\n\n",

Lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of three healthy donors and expanded for 72 hours yielding healthy, actively proliferating lymphocytes (Fig. 7A). Lymphocytes were then plated in culture dishes coated in a matrix composed of collagen, laminin, and fibronectin under serum-free conditions and allowed 20 minutes for adherence. Non-adherent lymphocytes were collected from the culture supernatant (Fig. 7B), and the adherent lymphocytes were then separately harvested (Fig. 7C). Viability of cells in both fractions was assessed via trypan blue and RNA was extracted for gene expression analysis. Cell viabilities were greater than 95% in both populations in the case of every donor. Expression levels of ITGA3 and the PKA-binding AKAP7 variants were significantly higher on lymphocytes in adherent fractions than those in the non-adherent fractions (Fig. 7D).

Alternative splicing results in multiple AKAP7 isoforms which are functionally diverse within the context of A-kinase signaling. The AKAP7 gene codes for three splice variants (AKAP7\u03b1, AKAP7\u03b2, AKAP7\u03b3) which are known to be expressed and produce functional protein isoforms (Supplementary Figure 3)20. These AKAP7 isoforms all contain a conserved PKA-binding domain, but distinctive tethering domains and targeting motifs which are associated with differing intracellular localization20, 25. AKAP7\u03b3 is unique with regards to AKAP7\u03b1 and AKAP7\u03b2 in that it contains a phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain26. The function of this domain is currently unclear; structural similarity to bacterial 2\u20325\u2032 RNA ligases has led to the hypothesis that it may have RNA ligase activity27, while studies which have shown AMP binding ability have led to the suggestion that it serves as an AMP sensor26. In addition to the splice variants which are known to code for proteins, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) eukaryotic genome pipeline had previously predicted that the AKAP7 gene may also code for as many as six additional splice variants21. The sequences of these previously predicated splice variants suggest some would be targeted for non-sense mediated decay while others would generate protein isoforms containing the PDE domain but lacking the PKA binding domain (Supplementary Figure 3). While AKAP7 has been most widely studied in the skeletal muscle, cardiac tissue, and the brain, little is known about the physiological role of AKAP7 in the peripheral immune system.",

Our results provided evidence that all previously established protein coding AKAP7 splice variants, as well as all previously predicted AKAP7 splice variants, are expressed in the peripheral immune system. Our results further suggest that the PKA-binding isoforms of AKAP7 are predominantly expressed on cells of lymphoid origin, and that their expression levels are highly correlated with those of ITGA3, a cell adhesion molecule known to interact with various extracellular matrix proteins including with laminin, collagen, and fibronectin28. ITGA3 has recently been shown to signal via cAMP and PKA upon ligand binding29; thus, it is highly plausible that the strong relationship we observed between the expression levels of the PKA-binding AKAP7 splice variants and the expression levels of ITGA3 exists because these AKAP7 isoforms mediate the interaction between ITGA3 and PKA. Interestingly, elevated expression of ITGA3 is associated with lymphocyte invasiveness30, 31, and inhibition of ITGA3 has been to shown to limit leukocyte extravasation in inflammatory conditions such as sepsis19. In light of our observations, this information led us to hypothesize that the PKA-binding isoforms of AKAP7 are markers of ITGA3-mediated lymphocyte adhesiveness, and are likely elevated in patients who later develop post-stroke BBB disruption as a result of the presence of an invasive lymphocyte population in the peripheral blood.",

The presence of a lymphocyte population with such properties in the peripheral immune system following stroke could contribute to disruption of the BBB by both direct and indirect mechanisms. The process of cerebrovascular lymphocyte extravasation alone inherently reduces the integrity of the BBB32, and heightened accumulation of lymphocytes in the brain parenchyma increases the risk of further BBB disruption via the development an adaptive immune response directed at central nervous system antigens33. The development of such a response leads to lymphocyte-mediated production of pro-inflammatory chemokines which drive increased influx of innate immune cell populations such as neutrophils and monocytes from the periphery into the central nervious system34; during this process, these myeloid immune populations produce proteolytic molecules such as matrix metalloproteinases which further act to compromise the integrity of the BBB2. Expectedly, it has been shown in multiple studies that increased lymphocyte activity post-stoke leads to poor prognosis35, 36. Thus, our results suggest that AKAP7 and ITGA3 are molecules which could potentially be targeted therapeutically to limit lymphocyte-mediated post-stroke injury exacerbation.",

Early identification of patients at heightened risk for post-stroke BBB disruption allows for clinicians to make more informed decisions regarding the administration of thrombolytic therapies, and can ultimately improve clinical management6. As a result, several prior studies have looked to identify blood biomarkers which are predicative for the development of post-stroke BBB disruption. The most widely investigated and once considered the most promising of these potential biomarkers is S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B). Multiple studies have observed early elevated plasma levels of S100B in AIS patients who later develop BBB disruption37, 38, however S100B has only exhibited modest levels of diagnostic robustness; in the largest clinical study performed to date evaluating the ability of S100B to identify patients at risk for post-stroke BBB disruption, S100B was only able to do so with 93% sensitivity and 48% specificity38. In the study reported here, albeit in a limited sample size, early transcriptional levels of AKAP7 exhibited an ability to predict post-stroke BBB disruption with levels of diagnostic performance exceeding those reported with regards to a majority of previously proposed biomarkers; these findings make AKAP7 a candidate for further clinical evaluation with regards to biomarker use.",

            "text": "In addition to providing insight into the role of leukocyte AKAP7 in the context of stroke, this study generated novel data regarding the genomic regulation of AKAP7. This study was the first to provide substantial evidence that all six AKAP7 splice variants which were bioinformatically predicted by the NCBI eukaryotic genome pipeline are expressed in nature. Of these variants, AKAP7x3 and AKAP7x6 are predicted to undergo non-sense mediated decay based on the presence of stop codons more than 50 nucleotides upstream of the first 3\u2032 exon-exon junction39. The sequences of remaining previously predicated splice variants (AKAP7x1, AKAP7x2, AKAP7x4, AKAP7x5) suggest they have the capacity to code for proteins. The protein isoforms which would be generated by these splice variants would be highly homologous to AKAP7\u03b3, however lack the presence of the PKA binding domain. This suggests it is likely that AKAP7 protein isoforms exist in nature which lack A-kinase binding ability. It is possible that these isoforms could act as decoy proteins which occupy AKAP7 anchoring sites to inhibit the scaffolding of A-kinases. Alternatively, because three of these four potential protein isoforms are predicted to contain an untruncated PDE domain as their predominant feature, it is also plausible that they have some other biological function directly inferred by the PDE domain. As future studies provide more insight regarding the role of the PDE domain, the function of these previously predicated splice variants may become more clear. Our results imply that these previously predicted splice variants are expressed at much lower levels in the peripheral immune system than the established splice variants which code for PKA-binding protein isoforms, however, the dynamic intra-variant regulation we observed suggests they are of biological significance. Expectedly, due to their seemingly opposing biological function within the context of A-kinase signaling, we observed inversely regulated expression levels between the previously predicted splices variants and the established splice variants which code for PKA-binding protein isoforms. Thus, AKAP7 alternative splicing may play a much larger role in regulation of cAMP signaling than previously anticipated.",

The sample size in this study was not large enough to draw definitive conclusions regarding the potential use of AKAP7 as a clinical biomarker for prediction of post-stroke BBB complications. However, we feel the results of this this preliminary analysis are promising and investigation into the prognostic value of AKAP7 in a larger clinical cohort is warranted. In terms of understanding the mechanistic role of AKAP7 in the peripheral immune system with regards to stroke pathophysiology, much of the analysis in this study was associative in nature and performed only at the level of transcription. The biological mechanisms proposed based on the associative observations of this study should be validated in future pre-clinical work which takes a more direct experimental approach, potentially via genetic manipulation of AKAP7 in-vivo. Furthermore, our assumption that the association between whole blood AKAP7 levels and post-stroke BBB disruption is driven by a lymphocyte-dependent mechanism was based on the observation of lymphocyte-specific AKAP7 expression on isolated leukocyte subpopulations; however, this analysis was restricted to a limited number of healthy individuals and only surveyed the three most predominant subpopulations of leukocytes. Thus, future work may want to address the possibility that non-lymphoid sources of AKAP7 may contribute to the whole blood elevation in expression levels observed with post-stroke BBB disruption. Despite the aforementioned limitations, we feel that this work provides compelling evidence that AKAP7 in the peripheral immune system plays a role in post-stroke BBB pathology. We feel these results provide valuable foundational knowledge which will allow for more in-depth exploration into AKAP7 as both a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target with regards to post-stroke BBB disruption.",
