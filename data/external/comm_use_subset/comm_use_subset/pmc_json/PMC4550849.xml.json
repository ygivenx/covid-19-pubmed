            "text": "Anthrax toxin and diphtheria toxin enter the cytoplasm from acidified endosomes4. Whereas diphtheria toxin is an ADP ribosyl transferase, anthrax toxin is a protease that cleaves host MAPKK (Fig. 1c). To identify agents that inactivate host proteins exploited by toxins, we focused on hits that inhibit the mechanistically differently acting anthrax and diphtheria toxins. In order to elucidate host-targets inhibited by these drugs, we used only anthrax toxin, as the host cellular pathway that delivers the anthrax toxin into the cytoplasm is one of the best understood pathways5 (and Fig. 1c). Anthrax lethal toxin is an exotoxin protein complex consisting of protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF), which act collectively to damage the host cell6. PA is an 83 kDa cellular receptor-binding protein (PA83), and the combination of PA with LF is cytotoxic6. LF is a 91 kDa zinc metalloprotease that cleaves the N-terminal substrate docking site of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAP2K), preventing the passage of signals in the ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathways7. Intoxication of a cell begins when PA83 binds to host cellular receptors, capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2), tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), or integrin beta 1 (ITGB1)289. Once bound, host furin cleaves a 20 kDa fragment from the N-terminus of PA83, thus activating the 63 kDa protein, PA6310. Following activation, PA63 forms a heptamer and binds LF11. The toxin undergoes clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a decrease in endosomal pH induces the formation of an endosomal membrane PA channel, by which LF translocates into the cytosol12 before PA pores are transported to lysosomes for rapid degradation81314. PA has been shown to induce the process of autophagy, whereby autophagosomes encapsulate endosomes and facilitate the delivery of LF into the cytoplasm15. A lysosomal protein, cathepsin B, is necessary for the autophagic flux, whereby LF is delivered from the intralumenal vesicles of the autophagosome-encapsulated multivesicular late endosomes into the cytoplasm through a back fusion process141617.",

We tested the ability of DEAQ to reduce anthrax toxin mediated cellular killing, and we observed that just like AQ, DEAQ was able to reduce toxin-mediated cytotoxicity with an EC50 of 5 \u03bcM (Fig. 2c). Since AQ and its metabolite, DEAQ, protected host cells against anthrax toxin killing, we evaluated the efficacy of AQ as a therapeutic agent during anthrax toxin intoxication in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animals were injected intravenously with a lethal dose of anthrax toxin (LD100) and were intravenously co-injected with AQ at 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg. The AQ doses were selected based on the FDA approved AQ dose of 10 mg/kg18. Animals that received a lethal dose of anthrax toxin without AQ all died within 90 minutes post intoxication (Fig. 2d). While the administration of AQ at 1.5 mg/kg saved 40% of the rats, all of the animals in that group displayed classical signs of having undergone a toxin challenge, such as ataxia, lethargy, hyperpnea, and tachypnea. Rats that were challenged with anthrax toxin and treated with AQ at 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg all survived without displaying toxin-associated symptoms (Fig. 2d).",

We observed that AQ did not block binding of PA83 to cells or block proteolytic processing of PA to generate PA63 (Fig. 4a). The inability of AQ to block the activity of host furin cleavage of PA83 is consistent with our observation that AQ equally reduces sensitivity of host cells to both PA83 + LF and PA63 + LF treatments (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Lysosensor is a green fluorescent dye used for tracking acidic organelles in the cell. Neutralization of these compartments can be visualized as a loss in punctate-fluorescent structures. In the absence of AQ, PA-treated cells displayed Lysosensor fluorescence, and AQ markedly decreased cell-associated Lysosensor fluorescence (Fig. 4b). These results predict that AQ may block the ability of PA to either access acidified endosomes or to form PA pores. It is known that the pore formation of PA, which results from exposure to acidic pH within endosomes, is resistant to dissociation by SDS and runs as an oligomer on SDS-PAGE22. Surprisingly, treatment of cells with AQ resulted in higher, rather than lower, abundance of SDS-resistant PA-oligomers compared to cells treated with PA only (Fig. 4c).",

Upon formation of the SDS-resistant PA63 pore in acidic endosomes, PA pores are then transported to lysosomes for rapid degradation24. Ha et al. showed that cathepsin B mediates the fusion of lysosomes with endosomes, and that this fusion is necessary for the release of LF from the endosomes into the cytoplasm14. In order to gain further insight into the mechanism of AQ-mediated protection of cells against anthrax toxin killing, we tested whether AQ inhibits cathepsin B protease activity of purified human cathepsin B using a FRET assay. We observed that both AQ and DEAQ directly inhibit cathepsin B activity in a dose dependent manner without drug pre-incubations, at drug concentrations used in cellular experiments (Fig. 4d). We tested whether AQ inhibits cathepsin B in RAW264.7 cells. We observed that cells pre-treated with AQ or with DEAQ for 1 hour lost cathepsin B enzymatic activity in a dose dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In addition, we tested the ability to AQ to inhibit cathepsin B activity in a protein lysate from cells that were not exposed to drugs prior to the lysis, and we observed that AQ and DEAQ inhibited cathepsin B activity (Supplementary Fig. 3b). We determined that the addition of drugs to cathepsin B reactions did not change the pH (pH 5.8) of the reaction buffer. In all of the cathepsin B experiments we observed that CQ and its metabolite, Desethyl-Chloroquine (DECQ), were weaker inhibitors of cathepsin B activity (Fig. 4d and Figure S3), which corresponds to the phenotypic data seen in Fig. 2.",

This technique is a powerful label-free ligand-observed tool to study molecular interactions in solution2526. STD relies on the transfer of selective saturation (excitation) of the protein\u2019s atoms to atoms located in the bound ligand. Two 1D 1H-NMR spectra are acquired\u2014one in which the protein\u2019s signals are selectively saturated (\u201con\u201d resonance, Isat), and another in which no signals are saturated (\u201coff\u201d resonance, I0). Ligand binding is evident by the difference spectrum (I0 \u2212 Isat), as only when binding occurs are the signals of the ligand affected. Figure 4e shows the 1H-NMR spectrum of 2 mM AQ in the presence of 20 \u03bcM cathepsin B (ligand:protein molar ratio of 100:1), and its corresponding STD difference spectrum. The presence of AQ signals in the difference spectrum clearly indicates that it is binding to the enzyme. An inspection of the atom-specific effects provides insight into the mode of binding. Atoms in the quinoline backbone display the largest reduction in their intensities, suggesting that they are in close proximity to cathepsin B (Fig. 4f, atoms H4 and H5 exhibit STD effects of 100 and 97%, respectively). In contrast, the H9 and H10 methylene protons are modestly affected, suggesting that in the complex they are located distal to hydrogen atoms in the protein. Interestingly, several atoms in the phenol ring display substantial STD effects suggesting that they are near the protein. This is consistent with the lower biological activities of AQ analogs that remove the phenol ring (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The importance of the AQ quinoline ring revealed by STD is also compatible with the crystal structure of cathepsin B bound to nitroxoline, as this small molecule contains a quinoline moiety that interacts extensively with the enzyme27.",

Ebola virus, among other viruses, requires low endosomal pH28 as well as host cathepsin B function29 for membrane fusion and infection of host cells. In fact, AQ and CQ have recently been reported to inhibit Ebola virus pathogenicity in cells2829. We re-tested AQ and CQ\u2019s ability to inhibit Ebola virus abundance in infected HeLa cells by visualizing infected cells using immune-staining, and in addition we tested the ability of their metabolites, DEAQ and DECQ, to inhibit Eboa virus propagation in cultured cells in vitro. To test AQ-mediated inhibition of viral propagation, we compared infection by Ebola virus (Kikwit) at MOI of 0.5 with and without drugs for 48 hours. To detect infected cells, immuno-staining was completed with anti-Ebola-glycoprotein antibodies. AQ and DEAQ effectively inhibited propagation of Ebola virus in HeLa cells with EC50\u2019s in the low \u03bcM range (Table 1): the EC50\u2019s of AQ and DEAQ were 3.8 and 3.6 \u03bcM respectively. The EC50\u2019s of CQ and DECQ in HeLa were 4.8 and 7.3 \u03bcM respectively. This data shows that DEAQ is more efficacious in inhibiting Ebola propagation compared to DECQ. Similar results were obtained by testing AQ, CQ, DEAQ, and DECQ for their ability to inhibit Ebola virus in primary human cell line, HFF-1 (Supplementary Table 1). This result confirms that anti-viral effect of AQ is not related to its effects on the host cell cycle or cellular proliferation.",

For example, it has been determined that after oral administration in healthy subjects, AQ is quickly absorbed and biotransformed into its main active form, DEAQ, which in turn is slowly eliminated with a terminal half-life of 9\u201318 days. The availability of PK values for AQ allows us to compare it to our in vitro data. The EC50 values for all of the tested pathogens inhibited by AQ or by DEAQ were at low \u03bcM range. Importantly, the known Cmax values (maximal amounts of drug in the blood after oral administration) of DEAQ in humans are in low \u03bcM range434445 and are comparable to the DEAQ EC50 values found in vitro for tested pathogens. This suggests that it is possible to achieve anti-pathogen effective AQ doses in blood by orally administered AQ.",
