Secondly, the precise and versatile arrangement of co-ligands on the metal centre allows the interactions of metal complexes with biomolecules to be fine-tuned for maximum selectivity and sensitivity. Thirdly, these metal complexes often possess interesting photophysical properties that are strongly affected by subtle changes in their local environment. For example, Pt(ii)71\u201373 and Ru(ii)74\u201377 complexes have been extensively investigated as \u201cmolecular light switches\u201d for nucleic acids, including G-quadruplex DNA. However, luminescent complexes based on the Ir(iii) center have been comparatively less explored. In this study, a series of luminescent Ir(iii) complexes were synthesised and evaluated for their ability to act as G-quadruplex-selective luminescence switch-on probes. The iridium(iii) complex 9, [Ir(phq)2(phen)]PF6 (where phq = 2-phenylquinoline; phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), (Fig. 1) was employed as a G-quadruplex probe for the construction of a label-free luminescent detection platform for helicase activity in aqueous solution, utilizing hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase as a model enzyme. To our knowledge, no luminescent G-quadruplex-based assay for the detection of helicase activity has yet been reported in the literature.",

We designed a double-stranded oligomer consisting of a G-quadruplex-forming sequence (ON1, 5\u2032-GTG3TAG3CG3T2G2TG2CGACG2CAGCGAG2CAGAG2AGCAGAG3AGCA-3\u2032) and its complementary cytosine-rich sequence (ON2, 5\u2032-GC2TCGCTGC2GTCGC2AC2A2C3GC3-3\u2032), which acts as a substrate for helicase. In the absence of helicase, the double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate is not unwound, and remains as a duplex structure that interacts only weakly with the luminescent Ir(iii) complex. However, in the presence of helicase, unwinding of the duplex DNA substrate by helicase generates two ssDNA fragments. After the reaction is stopped by the addition of EDTA,51 the G-quadruplex-forming oligomer ON1 is able to fold into a G-quadruplex motif in the presence of K+ ions. The nascent G-quadruplex structure is then recognized by the luminescent Ir(iii) complex with an enhanced emission response, allowing the system to function as a switch-on luminescent probe for helicase activity.",

Of these seven complexes, only complex 7 bearing the N^N ligand chlorophen (5-chloro-1,10-phenanthroline) and the C^N ligand phq showed a selective response for G-quadruplex DNA (Fig. S1\u2020), while not showing any luminescence enhancement in the presence of helicase (data not shown). On the other hand, complexes 3, 5, and 6 were found to be non-selective for G-quadruplex DNA (Fig. S1\u2020), whereas the luminescence of 1, 2, and 4 was enhanced in the presence of helicase only (data not shown). Based on the structure of complex 7, a focused library of eleven Ir(iii) complexes (7\u201317, Fig. 1) containing phq and chlorophen derivatives as ligands were designed and synthesised. Encouragingly, the second round of screening revealed that the Ir(iii) complex 9 displayed a significantly enhanced luminescence response in the presence of the PS2.M G-quadruplex (Fig. S2\u2020), and no luminescence enhancement in the presence of helicase (Fig. S4\u2020). Meanwhile, complexes 14\u201317 were non-selective for G-quadruplex DNA (Fig. S1\u2020), while the luminescence of 8, and 10\u201313 was enhanced on addition of helicase only (data not shown). To further validate the suitability of 9 as a G-quadruplex-selective probe, we performed G-quadruplex fluorescent intercalator displacement (G4-FID) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting assays to determine the selectivity of 9 for G-quadruplex DNA. The G4-FID assay showed that complex 9 was able to displace thiazole orange (TO) from G-quadruplex DNA (G4DC50 = ca. 5 \u03bcM, half-maximal concentration of compound required to displace 50% TO from DNA) with higher efficacy than from duplex DNA (Fig. 2b). Additionally, FRET melting assays revealed that the melting temperature (\u0394T\nm) of the F21T G-quadruplex was increased by about 13 \u00b0C upon the addition of complex 9 (Fig. S3a\u2020). In comparison, only a 4 \u00b0C change in the melting temperature of F10T dsDNA was observed for the same concentration of complex 9 (Fig. S3\u2020). Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of complex 9 to discriminate between G-quadruplex DNA and dsDNA or ssDNA. The luminescence enhancement of complex 9 in the presence of G-quadruplex DNA is presumably due to its ability to bind to G-quadruplex structures through groove/loop binding or end-stacking interactions. This shields the complex from the aqueous solvent environment and suppresses non-radiative decay of the excited state, thus leading to enhanced triplet state emission.",

Given the promising G-quadruplex-selective luminescence behaviour exhibited by complex 9, we sought to employ 9 as a G-quadruplex-selective probe to construct a label-free luminescent detection platform for helicase activity in aqueous solution. We first investigated the luminescence response of complex 9 and the ON1-ON2 duplex substrate to helicase. Upon incubation with helicase, the luminescence of 9 was significantly enhanced. We hypothesize that the luminescence enhancement of the system was due to the unwinding of the duplex DNA substrate by helicase, which allowed the formation in the presence of K+ of the G-quadruplex motif that was subsequently recognized by 9. To verify the mechanism of the proposed assay, a number of control experiments were conducted. We first incubated complex 9 with helicase in the absence of the duplex DNA substrate. No luminescence enhancement was observed, indicating that complex 9 did not directly interact with helicase (Fig. S4\u2020). We also designed mutant DNA sequences (ON1m, 5\u2032-GTATATATACCG3T2G2TG2CGACG2CAGCGAG2CAGAG2AGCAGAG3AGCA-3\u2032) that are unable to form a G-quadruplex structure in the presence of helicase, due to the lack of key guanine residues. We observed a slight decrease in the luminescence of 9 in response to helicase in the presence of the mutant DNA sequences, indicating that the formation of the G-quadruplex motif was important for the luminescence enhancement of the system (Fig. S5\u2020). Taken together, these results suggest that the luminescence enhancement of the system originated from the specific interaction of 9 with the G-quadruplex motif, which was generated by the unwinding of the duplex DNA substrate by helicase.",

The results showed that no significant change in the luminescence intensity of the 9/G-quadruplex ensemble was observed upon the addition of 0.8 \u03bcM HCV NS3 helicase, indicating that this helicase did not unfold the G-quadruplex structure employed in this study (Fig. S6\u2020).

Ir(iii) complex 9 was discovered to be a G-quadruplex-selective luminescent probe, and a label-free luminescent assay for helicase activity was developed utilizing the G-quadruplex-selective property of 9. Compared to previously reported radiographic or luminescent assays that require multiple steps and/or the use of isotopically or fluorescently labeled nucleic acids, our label-free approach is less time consuming and more cost-effective, as expensive and tedious pre-labeling or immobilization steps are avoided. On the other hand, the labeling of an oligonucleotide with a fluorophore may disrupt the interaction between the oligonucleotide and its cognate target. Finally, our developed label-free DNA-based detection platform employs luminescent transition metal complexes, which offer several advantages compared to the relatively more popular organic fluorophores, such as long phosphorescence lifetimes, large Stokes shift values and modular syntheses. Additionally, the assay could function effectively in diluted cell extract, and its potential application in the screening of helicase inhibitors was also demonstrated, though further optimisation may be required. We envision that our novel switch-on, label-free G-quadruplex-based luminescent detection method for helicase activity could potentially be developed as a useful tool in biochemical and biomedical research.",
