In spite of precluding many of its causative risk factors, cancer still gives rise to about 550,000 deaths in the world every year and is the second leading cause of death next to heart disease [2]. The currently available cancer therapies usually suffer from poor selectivity between normal and invaded cells, with serious side effects and the development of drug resistance [3]. Therefore, the continued search to identify novel antitumor compounds bestowed with low toxicity and minimum side effects remains critically important.",

Various 3-substituted isatins have been utilized as anticancer drugs or drug surrogates. Example of this class of isatin derivatives is sunitinib (1, SU11248, SutentTM, Pfizer, Inc., Fig 1) which was clinically approved in 2006 and is used now as the standard first-line treatment for the management of gastrointestinal stromal cancers and renal cell carcinoma due to its multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibiting activity [8]. Nintedanib (2, Fig 1) is another potential anticancer agent of this class that possesses triple angiokinase inhibiting activity toward vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs),platelet-derived growth factor receptors(PDGFRs) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs)[9]. Semaxanib (3, Fig 1) was developed as a new anticancer candidate with multiple tyrosinekinase receptor inhibitor activity with GI50 values of less than 10 nM against 46 out of 53 NCI cell lines, but it has been discontinued in clinical trials owing to its dangerous side effects [10, 11].",

Moreover, indirubin (4) inhibits both glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) via binding to the ATP pocket with IC50 values of 0.190 and 0.075 mM, respectively [21, 22]. Azaindirubin (6, Fig 2) was developed to overcome the poor water solubility and hence low bioavailability of indirubin (4) and it showed anti-proliferative activity toward ovarian adenoma cell lines [23]. In the same vein, the symmetric bis-isatin derivative (7, Fig 2) displayed in vitro anti-proliferative activity against the HepG2 cell line with IC50 value about 4.23 mM [21].",

Elemental analyses were carried out at the regional center for microbiology and biotechnology, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates containing a UV indicator was employed routinely to follow the course of reactions and to check the purity of the products. All reagents and solvents were purified and dried by standard techniques. Compounds 4a [26], 4f [27], 4i [28] and 6a, b [29] have been previously reported.

The emulsifier, low molecular weight polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany). Dichloromethane (DCM) was purchased from Avonchem (United Kingdom). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was obtained from Loba Chemie (Mumbai, India). All ingredients used were of analytical grade. All cell lines have been purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).",

No initial burst release was observed, suggesting low 7e density at the surface of the microspheres and hence the homogenous distribution of 7e within the microspheres. The high polymer concentration led to the formation of a dense polymer matrix structure in the microspheres and no pores as observed in the SEM images, which resulted in a significant decrease in the initial burst release from the microspheres. The kinetics of 7e release from microspheres was close to the zero order model. The correlation coefficient (r2) was 0.9884 and the release curve was fitted to zero order kinetics.

Moreover, the interaction of the hydrophobic 7e molecule with the polymer matrix via hydrophobic binding forces might cause a trapping of the drug inside the particles and, therefore, slower release. The rate of 7e release from the loaded microspheres gradually increased, as 10% release was observed after three days (Fig 12).This was probably due to the diffusion of the drug, which was present at the surface of the microspheres. Thereafter, constant release was observed, which may have been due to 7e diffusion and matrix erosion mechanisms of the biodegradable PLGA polymer. Slow drug release from microspheres maybe due high encapsulation of the drug with low swelling of polymer in the release medium, leading to slow diffusion of the drug particles from polymeric matrices. Furthermore, the degradation of PLGA 50:50 is slow. Therefore, the release of 7e from microspheres may depend on drug diffusion, the PLGA surface and bulk erosion or swelling [34].Conclusively, compound 7e was slowly and continuously released from the PLGA microspheres with no obvious burst release. This behavior is consistent with a previous study using PLGA microspheres for sustained drug release [44] and with several anticancer drugs incorporated into microspheres [33, 40, 45\u201347]. This formula was used for further studies on the human lung cancer cell line A549.",

This assay demonstrated that entrapped 7e was more effective in arresting cell growth as compared with free 7e. The enhanced cytotoxicity of 7e-loaded microspheres was observed with increasing incubation time in a concentration dependent manner. Therefore, the decrease in percentage cell viability was not immediate but rather gradual and continuous due to the polymer that allowed for slow release of 7e from microspheres and hence its gradual cytotoxic effect. The extended activity of 7e from 7e-loaded microspheres might be explained by the fact that they can be adsorbed onto the cell membrane, generating a drug concentration gradient near the cell surface that could favor 7e to penetrate into the cell. Furthermore, the cell can phagocytize 7e-loaded microspheres, allowing 7e to be released inside the cytoplasm, thus contributing to a sustained 7e concentration [48].",

Increasing the incubation time of 7e-loaded microspheres to 72 and 120 h resulted in a significant reduction in its IC50 value by approximately 85 and 90%, respectively. On the other hand, the IC50 value of 7e-loaded microspheres was reduced to approximately 60 and 70% after 72 and 120 h, respectively, as compared with the IC50 values of free 7e. Statistical analysis revealed that these values were significantly different (P< 0.05) from the IC50 values of free 7e.",

Compounds 4a-o and 7a-e were subjected to in vitro anti-proliferative assessment against HT-29 (colon), ZR-75 (breast) and A549 (lung) human cancer cell lines. The most active congeners in the preliminary in vitro anti-proliferative screening, compounds 7b, 7d and 7e, showed average IC50 values of 4.77, 3.39 and 2.37 \u03bcM, respectively, as compared with the reference drug sunitinib which exhibited an average IC50 value of 8.11 \u03bcM towards the tested human cancer cell lines. Compound 7e was selected for deeper pharmacological testing to gain insight into its possible in vitro anti-proliferative mechanism of action. It increased caspase activity by 2.4- and 1.85-fold between 4 and 8 h of treatment, respectively, at 10 \u03bcM. Moreover, compound 7e decreased the percentage of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle with a corresponding increase in the S-phase. The increase in S-phase cells without a concomitant G2/M phase fraction may indicate a very rapid onset of apoptosis. In addition, compound 7eincreased p-Tyr levels by nearly two-fold with an apparent IC50 value of 3.8 \u03bcM, which is consistent with its growth inhibitory IC50 value. Compound 7e was incorporated into biodegradable PLGA microspheres to improve its in vitro anti-proliferative activity. The results of the in vitro anti-proliferative assay indicated that 7e-loaded PLGA microspheres exhibited better cytotoxicity as compared with free 7e toward the human lung cancer cell line A549 after 3 and 5 days of incubation.",
