It was first identified in Huaiyangshan, a mountainous area in Huaiyang County in the Henan province of China [1]. Subsequently, the virus has also been isolated from infected humans, ticks, and mammals in Japan and South Korea. SFTSV is so named as it causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an acute febrile illness characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic complications in infected humans. Patients with SFTS may also develop other clinical manifestations such as systemic upset, coma, slurred speech, gastrointestinal upset, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, as well as abnormal laboratory findings including leukopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, deranged liver function tests, proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated creatinine kinase and lactate dehydrogenate levels. The mortality rate of SFTS may be as high as 17% to 30% [1,2]. ",

Ribavirin exhibits some inhibitory effects on SFTSV replication in vitro and in a type I interferon receptor-deficient mouse model, but it was not found to be effective in a retrospective cohort of patients [2,7]. Comparatively, favipiravir (T-705), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor with broad-spectrum antiviral activities, demonstrated higher in vitro and in vivo antiviral effects against SFTSV. However, favipiravir is not clinically approved or readily available in many countries affected by SFTSV, including China. To identify drug compounds that can be used to treat patients or reduce the transmission of SFTSV, especially in the hospital setting, we conducted a drug repurposing program by screening a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library consisting of 1528 drug compounds. We first established a robust two-tier (ELISA followed by viral load reduction assay) screening platform for SFTSV. Using this drug screening platform, we identified five drug compounds with anti-SFTSV activity in vitro, and characterized the anti-SFTSV mechanism of the most potent drug, hexachlorophene, as an entry inhibitor of SFTSV.",

The cell viability, SFTSV-NP protein expression, and the S-segment viral genome copy number in the culture supernatant were monitored at 1, 3, and 5 dpi, respectively. Favipiravir was used as a positive control in all three assays [7]. As shown in Figure 1a, differences of cell viability between the favipiravir-treated and the DMSO-treated groups were less than 20%, indicating that the CPE inhibition assay was not a sensitive assay for drug screening when favipiravir was used as a positive control. Next, the culture supernatants were subjected to ELISA and qRT-PCR analyses. As shown in Figure 1b, >10-fold and >15-fold read-outs between the favipiravir-treated and the DMSO-treated groups were detected with 0.01 MOI at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively, by ELISA. In the viral load reduction assay, there was approximately 4-log10 difference in SFTSV RNA load between the two groups at the 3 dpi and 5 dpi (Figure 1c). These data suggested that both the ELISA and the viral load reduction assay were sensitive drug screening assays for SFTSV. Considering the cost-effectiveness of the two assays and the need to balance between maximum drug efficacy and drug half-life (t1/2), drug compound library screening was then performed using ELISA with 0.01 MOI of SFTSV as virus inoculum and the culture supernatant being collected at 3 dpi.",

As shown in Figure 4a, hexachlorophene or DMSO was co-mixed with SFTSV (5 MOI) and incubated with Vero cells for 2 h. Significantly lower viral RNA load was detected in the cells co-mixed with hexachlorophene (p = 0.0173) than those co-mixed with DMSO. Expectedly, there was no statistically significant difference between the DMSO and favipiravir groups, as the latter is a viral polymerase inhibitor (Figure 4a). The result indicated that hexachlorophene treatment interfered with SFTSV entry. To further dissect the anti-SFTSV mechanism of hexachlorophene, we performed virus attachment and inactivation assays to investigate whether the drug inhibited virus attachment to the host cell surface or directly inactivated the viral particles by binding to the viral envelope. As shown in Figure 4b, no significant (p = 0.7806) inhibitory activity was observed when hexachlorophene was added to Vero cells pretreated with the drug compound (\u22124 to 0 hpi), which suggested that virus attachment to the host cell surface was not affected. Virus infectivity was also not significantly (p = 0.3335) impaired when SFTSV was pre-incubated with hexachlorophene for 2 h, followed by the detection of plaque formation when hexachlorophene concentrations were <0.1 \u00b5M (Figure 4c).",

This event is induced by surface expression of viral fusion proteins that are fusogenic directly at the host cell membrane. Only viruses that are able to directly fuse at the cellular surface without the need of endocytosis induce syncytium formation. Syncytium formation of SFTSV-infected cells can be triggered by low pH buffer [19]. Since hexachlorophene interfered with SFTSV entry without inhibiting viral attachment to host cells or inactivating the virions (Figure 4), we therefore asked if hexachlorophene inhibited SFTSV membrane fusion. To this end, we first treated SFTSV-infected cells in citrate-phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 5.0. Then, the cells were treated with hexachlorophene (5.0 \u00b5M, 2.5 \u00b5M, or 0 \u00b5M) (Figure 5a). As shown in Figure 5b, syncytium formation in SFTSV-infected cells was dramatically inhibited by hexachlorophene in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SFTSV-induced cell fusion was impaired. ",

The SFTSV M segment encodes the two viral envelope glycoproteins (GPs), Gn and Gc. The N-terminal, Gn, is responsible for receptor binding to the cell surface while the C-terminal, Gc, is a fusion protein that facilitates virus entry [27]. To characterize the relative binding affinity and intermolecular interactions between hexachlorophene and the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein, molecular docking was performed to predict the binding pose of the drug. As shown in Figure 6a, hexachlorophene was predicted to bind with the deep hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein with a relative binding free energy \u0394G output of \u22129.2 kcal/mol [20]. Broad areas of hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the protein were predicted to occur, and the hydrogen and halogen bonds were predicted to stabilize the binding pose (Figure 6b,c). Overall, these findings suggested that the binding of hexachlorophene to the hydrophobic pocket at the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein was highly stable.",

Thus, drug repurposing programs have been increasingly conducted to find clinically approved drugs with in vitro and/or in vivo activity against emerging viruses [31]. The candidate drug compounds identified in these drug repurposing programs have the advantages of being clinically available with known pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and side effect profiles. This information would facilitate more rapid development of the repurposed drug compounds into clinical use. SFTSV is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that causes severe disease in infected humans with very limited antiviral treatment options. In this study, we established a robust two-tier drug screening platform and then used it to screen a drug library consisting 1528 FDA-approved drug compounds to successfully identify five drugs that were able to inhibit SFTSV replication at low micromolar levels. These included antibacterial and antifungal disinfectants (hexachlorophene and triclosan), multi-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid organ tumors (regorafenib), small molecule agonist of the c-mpl receptor for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and aplastic anemia (eltrombopag), and antiprotozoal agent (broxyquinoline).",

Moreover, hexachlorophene also exhibited antiviral activity against various RNA and DNA viruses. Disinfectants containing hexachlorophene exhibited antiviral activity against rhinovirus (in combination with ethyl alcohol) and rotavirus (0.75% hexachlorophene or 0.1% hexachlorophene with 70% isopropylalcohol) [33,34]. Hexachlorophene inhibited the 3C-like protease activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the in vitro replication of other coronaviruses, including murine hepatitis virus, bovine coronavirus, and human enteric coronavirus [35,36]. Hexachlorophene also exhibited antiviral activity against polyomaviruses (BK virus and Simian Virus 40) by inhibition of the large tumor antigen\u2019s ATPase activity of these viruses [37].",

We showed that hexachlorophene potently inhibited SFTSV replication, as evidenced by significant (>2-log10) reduction of viral RNA load and 100% plaque reduction at a drug concentration of 10 \u00b5M, which was below its CC50. The IC50 of hexachlorophene against SFTSV (1.3\u20132.6 \u00b5M) was lower than that the other anti-SFTSV drug compounds reported thus far (caffeic acid, 180 \u00b5M; ribavirin, 40.1 \u00b5M; favipiravir, 25.0 \u00b5M; amodiaquine, 19.1 \u00b5M; and 2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, 3.7 \u00b5M) [38,39,40]. Using a combination of virus entry, attachment, inactivation, and membrane fusion assays, we showed that hexachlorophene interfered with virus entry and virus-induced cell fusion without affecting virus attachment to host cells or inactivating the virions. Molecular docking predicted that hexachlorophene bound stably with the deep hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein, providing insights into the structural interactions between hexachlorophene and SFTSV that explain the drug\u2019s in vitro antiviral activity.",

Second, the novel antiviral activity and mechanism of hexachlorophene in this study would facilitate the use of hexachlorophene as a lead compound to developing more entry inhibitors with higher anti-SFTSV potency and lower toxicity. The antiviral activity and mechanism of the other identified hit compounds by our two-tier screening system should be further characterized in future studies.
