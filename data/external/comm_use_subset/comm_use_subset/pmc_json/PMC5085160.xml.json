            "text": "One of the new emerging mechanisms associated with the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and other tumors is the immune checkpoint pathway, which consists of cellular interactions that prevent excessive activation of T cells under normal conditions. As an evasion mechanism, many tumors are able to stimulate the expression of immune checkpoint molecules, resulting in an exhausted phenotype of T cells that cannot restrain tumor progression [1]. Emerging clinical data highlight the importance of one inhibitory ligand and receptor pair as an immune checkpoint: the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; B7-H1 and CD274) and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1; CD279), in preventing the killing of cancer cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. The PD-1 receptor is expressed by activated T cells, B cells and myeloid cells [2], whereas PD-L1 is expressed on antigen-presenting cells including human peripheral blood monocytes stimulated with interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) as well as on activated B cells and dendritic cells. In addition, PD-L1 is expressed constitutively on non-lymphoid tissues such as the heart, placenta, skeletal muscle and lung where it may serve to downregulate T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in PD-1+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to safeguard against autoimmune mediated tissue damage [2]. PD-L1 overexpression is also found on many tumor types [3] and mediates an immunosuppressive function through its interaction with PD-1 and other proteins, including CD80 (B7.1). Immunomodulatory human/humanized mAbs that target the PD-1/ PD-L1 axis have shown durable tumor control in clinical trials [4, 5] and good safety profiles [6]. An Fc-engineered anti-PD-L1 mAb that lacks Fc\u03b3R engagement has shown tumor regression in RCC, with a 12% of objective response rate, 41% stable disease lasting at least 24 weeks and 53% of progression-free survival at 24 weeks [4]. Furthermore, the immune checkpoint inhibitors have the advantage of facilitating a memory response unlike the existing cytotoxic and targeted cancer therapies [7].",

            "text": "A modified TCR called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) containing single chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) previously selected for high affinity against a tumor-associated antigen is a powerful new approach against cancer. The scFv presented in the first-generation CAR is linked to the intracellular signaling motif of CD3\u03b6 that facilitates T cell activation following antigen binding. In second-generation CARs, the scFv is linked to the signaling co-stimulatory endodomains of CD28, 4-1BB, or OX40 to CD3\u03b6, and third-generation CARs have two of these elements linked to CD3\u03b6 in tandem [8]. These co-stimulatory endodomains provide complete T cell activation during TCR recognition by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), improving cytokine production and proliferation of CAR T cells [9]. A prominent example of a clinically successful CAR T cell therapy for the management of B cell malignancies is the second-generation CD19-specific CAR encoding CD28 or 4-1BB signaling moieties, which has shown antitumor activity in clinical trials [10\u201312]. However, the effect of CAR T cells has been modest for the treatment of solid tumors due to several factors including the difficulty in identifying unique tumor associated antigens, inefficient homing of CAR T cells to tumor locations, their low persistence after infusion and their functional impairment in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the solid tumors [13].",

CAIX was chosen as a target to our CAR because this enzyme is overexpressed in many hypoxic solid tumors [14, 15], being the most well-characterized tumor-associated antigen overexpressed in ccRCC [16, 17]. Our results support the feasibility of this approach for the improved treatment of ccRCC which has the potential to be extended to other solid tumors.",

The lentiviruses generated from these constructs were transduced into CD8 T cells and cultivated in the presence of IL-21, which yielded CAR T cells with modestly improved proliferation than was seen with IL-2 (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B), while maintaining the same specific killing activity for CAIX+ RCC (Supplementary Figure 1C and 1D). The superiority of IL-21 compared with IL-2 to induce T cells proliferation was previously described [18, 19].

At this point, the killing activity of the anti-CAIX CAR T cells was retested against skrc59 CAIX+/PD-L1+ cells. As shown in Figure 3D, the anti-CAIX CAR T cells without anti-PD-L1 had lost their killing activity against CAIX+/PD-L1+ RCC in vitro to a level that was similar to the irrelevant CAR group, establishing that these anti-CAIX CAR T cells had become exhausted. In contrast, the RCC viability was reduced to 50% in the anti-CAIX CAR T/anti-PD-L1 IgG1 group and 25% in the anti-PD-L1 IgG4 CAR T group, respectively.

We did not treat the mice with systemic IL-2 to maintain the proliferation of CAR T cells to avoid the bias that this molecule could exert on the tumor growth. The data in Figure 4A\u20134C demonstrate that all three anti-CAIX CAR T cell groups showed decreased RCC growth compared to irrelevant anti-BCMA CAR T cells or untransduced cells over the course of the experiment. The marked anti-tumor effects exhibited by the anti-CAIX CAR T cells secreting anti-PD-L1 IgG1 or IgG4 become evident on Days 23 and 30 (Figure 4A and 4B). However, even one week after i.v. treatment with CAR T cells, we observed that the tumors were 2-3 times smaller in the anti-PD-L1-secreting CAR T cells when compared with parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells and the two control groups (Supplementary Figure 4A). We also analyzed CD45+ T cell survival in the mouse blood to gauge their survival in this passive transfer model. On Day 8 we observed that the proportion of human T cells within the PBMCs were only 10\u201315% (Supplementary Figure 4B). One week after the second injection (Day 23) the anti-PD-L1 IgG1 and IgG4 groups had tumors 15 times smaller than the control groups and 5 times smaller than the anti-CAIX CAR T cells without anti-PD-L1 secretion (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S4A). On Day 30, the group of mice treated with CAR T cells secreting anti-PD-L1 antibodies had tumors 5 times smaller than the control groups (Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure S4A). The excised tumor weights were also lower in the mice treated with CAR T cells secreting anti-PD-L1 antibodies, and this was particularly evident for the anti-PD-L1 IgG4 antibody group (Figure 4B and 4D).",

Granzyme B staining showed the highest percentage of 2+/3+ positive cells in the RCC tumors treated with the anti-CAIX CAR T cells secreting anti-PD-L1 IgG4 followed by anti-PD-L1 IgG1-secreting cells, both of which were higher than parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells and other control groups (Figure 5B and 5C). In addition, PD-L1 expression decreased dramatically in the tumors treated with anti-CAIX CAR T cells secreting either anti-PD-L1 IgG isotype compared to parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells (Figure 5D). The anti-PD-L1 mAb used for IHC [21] recognizes a different domain than the anti-PD-L1 mAb secreted by the lentivirus, and the decrease in PD-L1 expression observed in the groups treated with anti-PD-L1-secreting CAR T cells is probably due to endocytosis or tumor cell death. Moreover, a greater decrease in Ki67 expression was observed in the anti-CAIX/anti-PD-L1 IgG-secreting groups compared to parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells as can be seen both in the IHC images (Figure 5B) and total DAB pixel count graph (Figure 5E). When the intensity of Ki67 expression was compared among the positive stained nuclei (Figure 5F), only the anti-CAIX/anti-PD-L1 IgG4 CAR T cell group showed a shift toward a greater number of low positive cells, suggesting that the anti-PD-L1 IgG4 isoform is more potent in vivo (green bars). These studies demonstrate that the anti-PD-L1-secreting CAR T cells were more effective at ccRCC killing in vivo and that this is, at least in part, explained by their decreased exhaustion.",

We built our immunotherapy platform based on the scientific principles that are showing clinical success [6, 22]. This is important since CAR T cells are not immune to dysregulation once they reach the cancer site due to tumor cell contact and the complex soluble mediator milieu that can impact their function. Indeed, changing this microenvironment is the basis of encouraging clinical responses with mAb therapies that are aimed at restoring T cell anti-tumor immunity [22]. Engineering CAR T cells to secrete and deliver high concentrations of human mAbs against molecules involved in immune checkpoint blockade at the tumor site could diminish their potential to become exhausted as well as lead to trans reversal of exhaustion for the CD8+TILs and other immune cells that have accumulated at the tumor site. This was accomplished using a self-inactivating bicistronic lentivector that was engineered to produce human mAb-secreting CAR T cells [20, 23]. We used a mouse model of ccRCC to demonstrate proof-of-principle that anti-CAIX CAR T cells armed to deliver immuno-modulatory mAbs at the tumor site were superior to parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells in their ability to be resistant to exhaustion both in vitro and in vivo. As a result, a significant improvement in anti-tumor activity was seen in vivo. The ability of the secreted mAbs to recruit other immune cells to the tumor was also demonstrated.",

Treatment of ccRCC with anti-CTLA4 and PD-L1/PD-1 checkpoint blockade inhibitors has shown some promising clinical results [27, 28]. Here, anti-CAIX CAR T cells that stably express and secrete anti-PD-L1 IgG1 or IgG4 mAbs were studied and compared to parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells and other cell controls. These anti-PD-L1 mAb-secreting CAR T cells maintained their capacity to undergo clonal expansion when in contact with CAIX+ RCC cells and to secrete high levels of IFN\u03b3 and IL-2. Remarkably, in vitro results showed that the secreted anti-PD-L1 IgG1 or IgG4 can interact with the PD-L1+ RCC cells, reverse upregulation of the exhaustion markers PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 and restore tumor cell killing. Moreover, anti-CAIX CAR T cells secreting the IgG1 isotype of anti-PD-L1 were also able to induce ADCC in vitro.",

These anti-PD-L1-secreting anti-CAIX CAR T cells showed markedly enhanced anti-tumor effect with decreased tumor growth and weight when compared to parental anti-CAIX CAR T cells. In addition, both secreted anti-PD-L1 IgG1 or IgG4 are able to bind their target in the complex tumor milieu and induce PD-L1 downregulation. Moreover, the upregulation of granzyme B expression by anti-CAIX CAR T cells secreting anti-PD-L1 provides strong evidence for the restoration of killing activity of CAR T cells at the tumor site, and the decrease in Ki67 staining shows the reduction in the proliferation of tumor cells. While the mechanism of enhanced tumor cell killing is unknown, Fc\u03b3R-bearing NSG myeloid cells can bind human IgG1 and IgG4 and may have some role in tumor cell clearance in the presence of anti-PD-L1 IgG1 or IgG4 isotypes [29]. The known expression of PD-L1 on activated CD8 T cells [30] together with the more potent killing of hIgG1- over hIgG4-treated target cells by murine PMNs may have contributed to the superiority of anti-PD-L1 IgG4-secreting anti-CAIX CAR T cells in vivo.",

Our previous experience with this orthotopic ccRCC model in NSG mice showed that human NK cells last only for a few days in the mouse blood [31], and for this reason the injection of these NK cells was not performed until the end of the experiment. The results demonstrated the specific recruitment of human NK cells into the tumor of mice treated with anti-PD-L1 IgG1-secreting anti-CAIX CAR T cells. The results also demonstrate that the locally secreted IgG1 is retained at the tumor site and is not rapidly diffused into the blood circulation. These results reflect a potential increase in the therapeutic efficacy of these CAR T cells when applied in humans, since the IgG1 binding to Fc\u03b3RIIIa can induce NK-mediated ADCC. The local accumulation of NK cells can also facilitate the development of anti-tumor CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and increase the number of tumor-specific IFN\u03b3-producing cells [32].",

Indeed, the combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 mAb therapies have shown enhanced efficacy in clinical trials and appear to exert their effects on distinct populations of T cells [33\u201335]. In addition, in a HER2-transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, the group of mice treated with anti-HER2 CAR T cells and repeated injections of anti-PD-1 mAb after tumor implantation showed greater CD8+ CAR T cell function with less T cell exhaustion and enhanced tumor cell killing [36]. Our results demonstrate that armed second-generation anti-CAIX CAR T cells constitutively secreting anti-PD-L1 IgGs that are retained in the RCC milieu also show reduced T cell exhaustion and enhanced anti-tumor activity. It is possible that this single combination anti-cancer agent that delivers persistently high local concentrations of the anti-PD-L1 mAbs may provide a significant treatment advantage for solid tumors. The local expression of anti-PD-L1 mAb may also result in reduced systemic toxicity [37].",

The protocol that utilized multiple CAR T cell injections in association with IL-2 treatment resulted in toxicity comprised of limiting liver enzyme elevations caused by the recognition of CAIX expressed at low levels on bile duct epithelium. The potential mechanism(s) of this toxicity revealed the generation of both the generation of human antibodies as well as cell-mediated immunity against the murine scFv which may have contributed to the toxicity and promoted CAR T cells neutralization and clearance [40]. A later study was also performed in which pre-treatment of the patients with a low dose of the same humanized anti-CAIX mAb was used to attenuate the activity of CAR T cells against bile duct epithelial cells [38]. These results suggest that the use of a human anti-CAIX scFv and the newer generations of CAR vectors could greatly improve the efficiency of CAIX-targeted CAR T cells.",
