Moreover, maternal and child healthcare institutions at the municipal level checked the cards reported by the district on a quarterly basis, and extracted data collected annually from 20% of the districts to ensure data integrity and accuracy. In addition, data-related staff of local maternal and child healthcare facilities were trained by specialist groups at regular intervals.

The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is one of the classic methods of time series analysis, based on past values of a series and previous errors in forecasting. Therefore, it can be appropriately used to forecast the U5MR. We considered the U5MRs from 1992 to 2013 as a training sample to fit the ARIMA model. The U5MRs from 1992 to 2013 and 2014\u20132015 were considered the internal and external samples for internal and external validation, respectively.

The main causes of death in children aged 1\u20134 years were tumours (leukaemia and other tumours) and accidents (drowning, traffic accident, accidental asphyxia, accidental poisoning, accidental fall and other accidents) in addition to pneumonia and congenital heart disease. The cause-specific mortality in these diseases also showed significant fluctuations, but were all reduced by varying degrees after 1992 (figure 2D).",

However, the cause-specific mortality rate of other diseases fluctuated with regular changes in interval. Therefore, we suspect that the Selective Two-child Policy may induce only a slight upward trend in the U5MR in Beijing instead of a major boost. This finding could be attributed mainly to the high level of healthcare and medical treatment available and is less likely caused by the influence of the policy on the U5MR. Using the forecasting model established in the present study, we predicted the U5MRs from 2016 to 2020 to be 2.88\u2030, 2.87\u2030, 2.90\u2030, 2.97\u2030 and 3.09\u2030, respectively, indicating a slight upward trend over the next 5 years.

            "text": "Our study has several advantages. First, the data are reliable because our study considers the entire population, based on the Beijing Under-5 Mortality Rate Surveillance Network and Beijing Maternal and Child Healthcare System which covers all under-5 children in all districts of Beijing. Thus, the present study is not limited by a small sample size or low coverage rate. Second, our study revealed the long-term trends in mortality rates and leading causes of death in under-5 children through a 24-year analysis. Furthermore, we reported the health conditions of under-5 children following implementation of the Selective Two-child Policy in Beijing in 2014. The results of our study will provide suggestions for the government to assess the present policy and formulate further regulations related to maternal and child healthcare. However, several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, because of the unique regional divisions in Beijing and the lack of specific data on each district, we did not analyse the differences between rural and urban areas. Second, the ARIMA (1,1,1) model forecasts future U5MRs reliably, but only for a short period. This is because the model only considered variations in mortality with time, instead of other possible impacting factors such as environment, economy and politics. Data must be continually updated to predict further mortality rates. Other models which can predict U5MRs more accurately and capture its patterns more specifically are needed. Thirdly, since we only collected 2-year data (2014 and 2015) after the Selective Two Child Policy (2014), the representativeness of the changing trend and solid statistical analysis is limited. The relation between the changing trend in U5MRs and policy regulation is still unclear and is needed to be observed for further years. We could only give a suggestion to raise healthcare workers\u2019 awareness about this potential problem.",

However, the U5MR might show a slight upward trend from 2016 to 2020. The key points for future consideration regarding child healthcare include the management of birth asphyxia, congenital heart disease, preterm/low birth weight and other congenital abnormalities. To further reduce the U5MR in Beijing, specific prevention measures should be adopted for children of various age groups.",
