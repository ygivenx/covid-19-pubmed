            "text": "To date, sequence-specific PCR is the most common approach for virus identification and quantification in diagnostic laboratories as it is highly sensitive, rapid, and cost effective. However, specific PCR requires prior knowledge of the virus sequence, and a separate assay needs to be designed for each individual virus or virus type. Recently, high-throughput or next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enabled metagenomic-based identification of viruses by sequencing random fragments of all genomes present in a clinical or environmental sample [1\u20133]. As viral metagenomics is virus-sequence independent, potentially any virus, cultivable or uncultivable, known or novel, can be readily detected and the method can be applied to all types of virus genomes, including single-stranded DNA and RNA. Several research studies have used this technology in recent years to explore the breadth of the virome in diverse biological and environmental samples including human and animal feces [4\u201312], blood [13, 14], animal and human tissues [15\u201317], and human respiratory tract secretions [18\u201322] and highlighted the validity of the approach to detect rare and novel viruses.",

Commonly employed methods include filtration, ultracentrifugation, and nuclease treatment [1, 24\u201331]. These methods rely on the small size of viruses and the stability of their capsid. Several approaches for virus genome amplification do exist: Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is often used for whole genome amplification [32\u201334], e.g., in the VIDISCA method for virus discovery [35]. Linker-amplified shotgun library (LASL) was applied for virus sequencing from marine water samples [8]. The anchored random PCR approach, as used in our study, has been frequently used and described in detail in previous studies [16, 36\u201342].",

Briefly, reads were quality-filtered by removing low quality bases (average PHRED score below 20), reads shorter than 75 bp and reads with low entropy (i.e., consisting mainly of repeats). Read passing quality filters were cleaned from non-viral reads by aligning with STAR [48, 49] against, in this order, human, bacterial, bovine, and canine genomes. Reads not matching any of the above genomes were aligned with BLAST [50] against an in-house viral database that contains approximately 46,000 different virus sequences. For each sequencing read that passed the quality filter, the BLAST hit with lowest e value was reported, given the identity was higher than 75%. Reads which did not match genomes used in the cleaning step and did not match viral genomes included in the database were reported as of unknown origin.",

We processed and sequenced 1000 \u03bcl of the reagent. As our bioinformatic pipeline VirMet determines the taxonomic origin of each individual read, we summed up reads at the species level and noted the most commonly reported strain. Of the 25 viruses expected in the reagent, we detected 17 and 15 different viruses in two replicates, respectively, with high numbers of reads (Table 1). Previous studies have sequenced the same viral pathogen reagent [30, 52]. We randomly subsampled our raw reads to match the numbers analyzed in these studies. Using 2,000,000 reads, we still detected 17 viruses in one of the replicates. Seven of the eight viruses we did not detect (Coronavirus 229E, Norovirus GI and GII, Influenzavirus A and B, Human parainfluenza virus 3) were missed by 15 to 79% of other methods as well [52]. Comparing our results to similar workflows (filtration, nuclease treatment, random amplification, NexteraXT, MiSeq) as, for instance, the sample preparation methods N1-N4 presented in Li et al. [30], our numbers of reads were higher as reported and we identified more virus species (Table 1, 150,000 reads). As previously shown, additional non-targeted viruses are present in the reagent and were detected by us as well (e.g., Bovine viral diarrhea virus, Bocavirus, Enterovirus; Table 1).\n",

Nuclease treatment enriched for all viruses, except HHV-5, which might, probably due to its size or envelope, not be as stable as smaller viruses. While the combination of low-speed centrifugation, filtration, and nuclease-treatment also showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences in other studies [29] and filtration and DNase treatment lead to dramatic improvements [25], some studies only found minor differences among the methods with or without filtration and nuclease digestion [30].

In contrast, HHV-4 virus is a large virus in respect to virion and genome size and often only single reads could be detected. It was suggested that filtration might actually have an adverse effect on large virus genomes such as herpesvirus and mimivirus [28]. In other studies of virus profiling in clinical specimens, lower numbers of HHV-4 reads as expected were also reported [55].

Stochastic effects in detection of very low abundant viruses and differences in analysis thresholds could have played a role as well. Comparing our results to more similar workflows (filtration, nuclease treatment, random amplification, NexteraXT, MiSeq), our numbers of reads were higher than reported and we identified more virus species [30].

In both virus combinations and experiments performed, there was a good correlation between the ratio of spiked viruses and the ratio of the resulting reads (Fig. 4). Direct correlations of viral copies with percentages of sequencing reads have been suggested [18, 54]. However, a direct quantification of input copy numbers based on sequencing reads seems not applicable. Viruses have different properties such as the presence of an envelope, types of genomes, and virion sizes, and certain virus or genome types are amplified preferentially as we have seen with Poliovirus in our experiments. Adding to the complexity, different composition of the genetic background in clinical samples will strongly influence the yield of virus reads. Nevertheless, the correlations showed that the ratio of sequencing reads is preserved over different input ratios and concentrations, signifying that the amplification method itself preserves the relative contribution of different viruses in a sample.",

Characterization of the virome and its alterations in specific disease settings might help to better understand and manage infectious diseases.
