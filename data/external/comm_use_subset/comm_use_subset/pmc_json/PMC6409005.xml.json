            "text": "Neuroinflammatory responses are mainly mediated by microglial activation, and they are implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [1]. Microglial cells are the primary resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are associated with defensive mechanisms to maintain homeostasis against brain injury [2]. In steady state, microglia exert protective responses by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. However, activated microglia produce excess immune reactions which are detrimental to brain tissue and can produce various proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) \u03b1, interleukins (ILs), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Released and accumulated, these proinflammatory mediators facilitate the development of neurodegenerative diseases [3, 4]. Therefore, it is important to suppress the secretion of proinflammatory mediators from activated microglial cells to prevent the neuroinflammation-related development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "\nAcanthopanax spp. is one of the well-known medicinal resources in traditional oriental medicine in China, Korea, Japan, and far-east Russia. Its dried roots and stem barks are famous traditional folk medicine for treating rheumatism, arthritis, paralysis, sinew, and bone pain [5]. Acanthopanax henryi (Oliv.) Harms, a Chinese endemic plant, has been used as a traditional remedy for the treatment of paralysis, arthritis, rheumatism, lameness, edema, injury from falls, hernia, and abdominal pain [6, 7]. Previous phytochemical studies on A. henryi led to the isolation and identification of more than 30 secondary metabolites, including five flavonoids, six caffeoylquinic acid derivatives [6], sixteen triterpenoid saponins [8, 9], one amide, one anthraquinone, one organic acid [9], three lignans, one diterpene, one phenylpropanoid, and two phytosterols [10]. In addition, it has been reported that this plant exhibits diverse pharmacological activities due to the wide variety of chemical constituents. For example, metabolites of the leaves of A. henryi have strong antioxidant and antiacetyl cholinesterase activities [6], and the 80% methanol fraction of root bark and ciwujianoside C3, which was isolated from leaves of this plant, have significant anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells [5, 11]. Moreover, some glycosides from the leaves of A. henryi have antiadipogenic effect, decreasing lipid accumulation through the inhibition of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1) in 3T3-L1 cells [12]. However, it has not been investigated yet whether this plant has antineuroinflammatory effects.",

The concentration required to inhibit the production of NO by 50% (IC50 value) was calculated based on the concentrations of NO and PGE2 released into the culture media as measured by the Griess method and PGE2 ELISA kit, respectively. Among the tested compounds, only compound 3 showed inhibitory effects against LPS-induced NO production with an IC50 value of 2.22 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcM and LPS-induced PGE2 production with an IC50 value of 2.28 \u00b1 0.23 \u03bcM.

Pretreatment with compound 3 attenuated the LPS-induced production of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, but it had little effect on IL-6 production (Figures 3(a)\u20133(c)). Subsequently, to elucidate how compound 3 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, the mRNA levels of the cytokines were examined. BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 6 h. Consistent with the results obtained from the cytokine production data, pretreatment with compound 3 reduced the LPS-induced mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, but it did not affect to mRNA level of IL-6 (Figures 3(d)\u20133(f)).

They are involved in the pathogenesis of various neuroinflammatory pathophysiological conditions [31]. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, are important factors in CNS immune responses, and mediate neurodegeneration [3]. Microglial cells are activated by various stimuli. The activation of these cells leads to the release of these proinflammatory mediators and the exacerbation of neuroinflammation and neuroglia-induced neurotoxicity [31, 32]. Our investigation showed that compound 3, isolated from A. henryi, suppressed NO and PGE2 production in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and also inhibited the LPS-induced expression of the iNOS and COX-2 protein (Figure 2). Additionally, the present data indicated that compound 3 significantly suppressed the release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-6, at the protein and mRNA levels (Figure 3).",

In inflammatory responses, the activation of MAPKs leads to release of inflammatory-related factors, such as iNOS, COX-2, ILs, and TNF-\u03b1 [34]. Therefore, we further investigated whether the antineuroinflammatory effects of compound 3 in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells were related to the inactivation of MAPKs. Our results showed that compound 3 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but it did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK MAPKs.",

This response upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in microglial cells [1]. Therefore, NF-\u03baB can be an important target for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, pretreatment with compound 3 did not decrease the nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 or the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 (data not shown). Considering the effect of compound 3 on the LPS-induced activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways, it is suggested that compound 3 exerted antineuroinflammatory effects by specifically inactivating the p38 MAPK pathway.",
