The precise and rapid documentation of respiratory specimens can lead to a significant effect on the disease progress in patients [2] when identification of the causative agents leads to providing an appropriate therapy administration, but it is also useful for decreasing the use of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy [3,4] and limiting the risk of secondary spread of infection [5]. However, ARIs are most often associated with poorly specific clinical presentations [6] and therefore, their aetiological diagnosis mainly relies on laboratory testing.",

            "text": "Conventional laboratory diagnostic methods have several limitations for routine detection of respiratory pathogens. For example, culture isolation of viruses of bacteria is poorly sensitive, time consuming and usually too slow to provide a biological result at the acute phase of the disease [7]; direct immunofluorescence assays and immunochromatographic antigen testing can provide results very rapidly but represent time- and labor-consuming tasks for the former, and are poorly sensitive for the latter [8,9,10]. Molecular biology testing allows the detection of a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens within hours, with excellent sensitivity and specificity and may represent a credible alternative to the aforementioned biological assays. However, given the number of aetiological agents potentially implicated in ARIs, conventional monoplex PCR assays are tedious, expensive and require large amounts of biological samples [10,11]. Consequently, multiplex molecular detection tests have been increasingly developed in recent years and a number of commercial kits have been proposed to diagnostic microbiology laboratories, which allow the detection of 12 to 33 different pathogens. This includes the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel, Fast or v1, assays (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada); the FilmArray respiratory viral panel assay (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT); the Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogen, 21 or 33, assays (Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg); the CLART PneumoVir (Genomica, Coslada, Spain); the RespiFinder, 19 or SMART 22, assay (Pathofinder, Maastricht, Netherlands); the eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Dx, Carlsbad, CA); the MultiCode-PLx (EraGen Biosciences); the Easyplex respiratory pathogen 12 kit (Ausdiagnostics, Sydney, Australia); the Seeplex RV15 OneStep ACE Detection and Pneumobacter ACE Detection (Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea); the Magicplex RV Panel Real-time Test (Seegene Inc); and the ResPlex II Panel v2.0 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Precisely evaluating such multiplex kits is difficult in the absence of undisputable golden standard reference techniques for a large number of the pathogens tested. A number of studies have compared the detection of the molecular multiplex platforms with in-house conventional molecular methods [11,12,13,14] but since the reference methods vary from study to study [15], estimating the actual performance of the assays remains difficult. More recently, direct comparison of commercialised multiplex kits was undertaken, with reference to in-house multiplex real-time PCR systems [16], or to commercial duplex PCR tests [17].",

Our analysis mainly focussed on viral pathogens that represent the common target of all kits, the number of bacteria potentially detected varying from 4 (RespiFinder SMART 22) to 12 (Fast Track Diagnostics Respiratory Pathogen 33), making any sound comparison impossible. We combined normalised extraction of nucleic acids, \"reference\" monoplex real-time PCR detection and a consensus interpretation algorithm to estimate the intrinsic capability of each kit to detection of the various pathogens tested.",

If we refer only to the ability of a technique to detect a pathogen or some of its molecular components in biological samples, some newly developed molecular techniques may be more sensitive than the reference techniques, (i.e., some \"false positives\", referring to the reference technique, may be true positives that have not been detected by this reference method). This situation may be met when the new technique is able to detect viral variants that could not be detected by previous methods and, in that case, corresponds to an actual improvement of the technique if the variants detected are true pathogens that can be implicated in ARIs. However, it can also be met when the new technique is able to detect a lower viral load. The actual clinical impact of an improved detection of low viral loads in respiratory samples has not been accurately evaluated and its medical significance at the acute phase of ARIs obviously requires to be further documented. Altogether, this indicates that the interpretation of evaluation scores should remain careful and open-minded. Accordingly, we have tried to build a comprehensive approach of the comparison of diagnostic kits that mixed reference to well established\u2013and clinically evaluated- real-time PCR detection techniques (this included in the current study the Argene Respiratory Multi Well System r-gene low range kit for Core tests, which has been used for years for routine detection in medical virology laboratories; and a series of published home-brewed techniques) and analysis of convergent positive results. For the latter, we considered that, given (i) the intrinsic high specificity of molecular amplification techniques, and (ii) the fact that the techniques compared used different technologies and amplification primers, the probability of obtaining false positive results with two different techniques for the same sample was negligible for an evaluation purpose. Consequently, samples in which a given pathogen was detected independently by two different techniques were declared positive for this pathogen, otherwise it was declared negative. We cannot exclude that a few samples were wrongly assigned a negative result (if a specific technique performed better than all others for a given pathogen), but the high degree of convergence between the different techniques suggests that the number of \"false negative\" results that could have been potentially generated is limited.",

            "text": "\nA second difficult issue for comparing respiratory pathogens multiplex techniques is the choice of the panel of samples tested. The nature and frequency of pathogens present in the samples tested are highly dependent on the epidemiological circumstances and on the populations tested, and have an obvious influence on the results of the analysis, e.g., the low number or absence of positive samples for some viruses represents in most of the studies an obvious obstacle for accurate comparisons. In the current study, we tested patients with ARIs from all age groups recruited in a household cohort that aimed at providing a picture of the French general population. This means that, in comparison with previous hospital-based studies, the paediatric population was under-represented and the clinical presentations were milder. In addition, the specific period studied (2010\u20132011) was associated with the predominant circulation of the pandemic H1N1 variant of the influenza A virus. Accordingly, the low number or absence of parainfluenza virus, human coronavirus type 229E, H3N2 influenza A virus, influenza C virus, human adenovirus and human parechovirus infections did not allow a significant comparison of kits for these pathogens. This is important to notice since in previous studies the low number of positive samples for some pathogens may have concealed the poor performances of some kits for detecting these pathogens (e.g., the case of Adenoviruses for the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel fast assay [9,17,25]).",

To take this aspect into account, we have identified \"Core tests\", i.e., a series of common pathogens detected by all kits (Inf A, Inf B, hRSV, hMPV, EV + hRV, AdV and hBoV). We have also limited our analysis to viral pathogens since bacterium detection was absent or very limited in 3 of the 4 kits tested. The simultaneous detection of bacteria and viruses represents a theoretical great advantage in terms of clinical management (e.g., for determining the appropriateness of starting an antibiotic treatment). However, it is noticeable that, in the current study, bacteria detection provided a large number of positive results, potentially shifting the rate of aetiological elucidation from 52% to >77% in the panel studied. Obviously, this deserves further in depth investigations, which should include samples from both ARIs and paired asymptomatic individuals. Determining the actual imputability of bacterial detection in the occurrence of ARIs may be difficult to achieve from qualitative results and clinically relevant interpretation algorithms remain to be established. As noted above, the detection of low pathogen loads may be an issue for viruses, but the case of bacteria is specifically difficult due to the frequent asymptomatic carriage of potentially pathogenic bacteria.",

There was also a trend for the existence of false positive results for Influenza A and Metapneumovirus tests, which altered the global positive predictive value of the kit (81.9% vs >90% for all other kits).
