It is of significant importance to numerous scientific areas, including animal and veterinary sciences. Despite this, proteomics has been limited in these disciplines due to a number of reasons, including cost, lack of good genomic data from many species of interest and a lack of awareness of the potential of this technology by animal scientists. Here we provide examples of successful applications of proteomics in animal production and health with insights into where farm animal proteomics-based research will be directed in the next few years, encapsulating contributions to this new technology through the existence of Cooperation in Science and Technology Action Proteomics in Farm Animals (www.cost-faproteomics.org).",

With the importance of protein as the end product of animal farming systems, it is perhaps surprising that the use of the most advanced protein analytical technology, proteomics, has been relatively neglected in farm animal research (Eckersall and Whitfield, 2011; Eckersall et al., 2012). This position has been addressed in the last 4 years by the creation of a European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action on Farm Animal Proteomics (FAP) www.cost-faproteomics.org, which has formed a network demonstrating the fundamental role that proteomics can and will have in farm animal and food research. This paper reviews the achievements of the COST action participants in relation to its three central and interconnected work group themes of (a) proteomics of animals and fish during production, (b) proteomics of the post-harvest changes as farm products are converted to food and (c) technological advances in proteomics and their potential for exploitation by the animal science community.",

Similarly, in the assessment of post-harvest modification, proteomic investigations have been undertaken to assess alteration in fish muscle (Kjaersgard et al., 2006) and in meat maturation, particularly in relation to product safety and verification of the species of origin (Paredi et al., 2012). The utilization of the full range of applications of proteomic investigation is dependent on the necessary expertise being available, and a cohort of early-stage researchers in animal sciences has now been exposed to these advanced technologies. It is now important that their aspirations to apply acquired knowledge for the benefit of animal science research be recognized and facilitated.",

            "text": "The current high potential for using proteomics in animal research has developed with advances in technology to separate and identify the proteins in a complex mixture such as it exists in biological samples. Separation of such a complex sample mixture can be performed either at the protein level (top-down approach) (Westermeier and Naven, 2002) or after digestion of the protein mixture to peptides (bottom-up approach) (Gevaert and Vandekerckhove, 2011), as summarized in Figure 1. For the first strategy, typically two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is applied under reducing and denaturing conditions. This minimizes protein interaction and allows separation of proteins or protein subunits according to charge (isoelectric point) in the first dimension, followed by second-dimensional molecular sieving by molecular mass (in SDS-PAGE). After staining with visible/colorimetric or fluorescent dyes, protein spots are detected and evaluated in abundance by means of dedicated software. Alternatively, modern methods of pre-electrophoretic protein labelling with fluorescent dyes (fluorophores) allow direct detection of separated protein spots (Miller, 2012). Protein spots of interest, usually those that vary in intensity in a treatment- or disease-dependent comparison, are enzymatically digested into peptides. On the basis of their size and fragmentation pattern, subsequent MS analysis attributes them to particular proteins, aided by computer-based search in dedicated large databases.\n",

Peptides are fractionated by chromatography, often in a multi-dimensional setup combining different separation principles (e.g. ion exchange-, reversed phase-, affinity columns). Quantitation in MS is based on isotopic or chemical labels that are introduced in a previous step into the organism, at the cellular level, by labelling the intact proteins or peptides, or performed in a label-free mode that requires high reproducibility of the analyses, besides the generally requested high mass accuracy and high-quality extensive databases (Nikolov et al., 2012).",

Given the economic importance of dairy farming, the majority of proteomic studies in bovines have been carried out to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms of mastitis and endometritis. In addition, proteomics has been applied to identify markers of stress in order to monitor animal welfare in increasingly intensified farm management practices.",

Stress in dairy cows is associated with increased susceptibility to infectious diseases such as mastitis, Johne\u2019s disease, salmonellosis and bovine respiratory complex, as well as other production diseases including those affecting fertility, uterine diseases (metritis, retained placenta, prolapsed uterus), ketosis and milk fever, especially during the periparturient period (Nir, 2003). Most proteomic investigations of bovine mastitis, using strategies including 2DE followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF)/MS and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), have been performed on bovine milk because of the relative ease of sample collection (Boehmer, 2011). These techniques have been used to evaluate the modification of milk proteins during mastitis in cows with naturally occurring infection (Hogarth et al., 2004; Smolenski et al., 2007) as well as in experimentally induced coliform mastitis (Boehmer et al., 2008; Boehmer et al., 2010a; Boehmer et al., 2010b; Danielsen et al., 2010). Hogarth et al. (2004) found significant increases in serum albumin and transferrin, concurrently with marked decreases in caseins, \u03b2-lactoglobulin and \u03b1-lactoglobulin, in the whey from cows with mastitis, suggesting that the transport of serum proteins into milk was because of the failure of the blood\u2013milk barrier. Smolenski et al. (2007) identified apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), cathelicidin-I, heat shock 70kD protein and the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) in milk fractions from cows with naturally occurring mastitis, indicating a local host response to infection in the mammary gland. Another acute-phase protein (APP), \u03b1-1-acid-glycoprotein, was identified for the first time by Boehmer et al. (2008) in normal and mastitis whey samples during a proteomic analysis investigating cows experimentally inoculated with E. coli. In a recent study, the serum proteome profile in cows with naturally occurring subclinical and clinical mastitis was investigated with three different yet complementary approaches in order to identify differentially expressed protein markers that are useful for early recognition of subclinical mastitis (Turk et al., 2012). Results demonstrated differential protein expression in the serum of cows with both subclinical and clinical mastitis. These data indicate the involvement of the acute-phase response, oxidative stress, complement activation, protease inhibition and lipid metabolism by the innate immune system to combat infection by pathogens.",

A limited number of proteomic studies have focussed on pathogen responses during clinical intramammary infections (Taverna et al., 2007, Tedeschi et al., 2009). Taverna et al. (2007) discovered major membrane-associated proteins in bovine mastitis S. aureus isolates that could be involved in the recognition of mammary epithelial cell receptors. Tedeschi et al. (2009) identified the three highly immunogenic proteins in bovine mastitis S. aureus isolates involved in virulence. Recent proteomic studies investigating different S. aureus strains isolated from cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis resulted in the identification of 15 proteins that exhibited variable expression in a range of S. aureus isolates (Wolf et al., 2011).",

This study identified a set of 10 proteins whose expressions are upregulated during natural infection (Hughes et al., 2007), which may have implications for biomarker studies and therapy design strategies. The proteome of pathogenic leptospires, the causative agent of leptospirosis, expressed during urinary excretion from reservoir hosts of infection, is modulated to facilitate host evasion by diminution of antigen expression and increased expression of the virulence factor Loa22 (Nally et al., 2007; Monahan et al., 2008). Furthermore, proteomic technologies are compatible with novel extraction procedures to enrich for bacterial hydrophobic outer membrane proteins expressed during infection (Nally et al., 2007; Crother and Nally, 2008). Finally, the continued development of novel proteomic approaches such as Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometry (CE-MS) have the capability to identify panels of peptides that can be used for disease diagnosis and for differential diagnosis of the causative bacteria of the infections of the mammary gland (Mansor et al., 2013; Albalat et al., 2014). As with bovine species, a significant amount of proteomic studies have been performed on porcine species (de Almeida and Bendixen, 2012; Ceciliani et al., 2014). In addition to its role during meat production, the porcine species is an important animal model for the study of disease in humans.",

To accommodate this demand, aquaculture companies are now breeding fish to improve traits such as their growth rate, conversion of feed into muscle, disease resistance, fertility and other features associated with food quality. Nevertheless, one of the main challenges faced by this industry is its impact on environmental sustainability where clearly a public intolerance to any potential new source of pollution or the further degradation of the natural environment may act as a drawback. Proteomics application in aquaculture is mainly focussed on nutrition, welfare and health management, as these have proven to be major constraints to an efficient production in aquaculture systems (Rodrigues et al., 2012).",

However, proteomics is contributing greatly to a better understanding of the metabolic pathways affected by these dietary changes, as demonstrated in species like rainbow trout (Martin et al., 2003; Vilhelmsson et al., 2004; Keyvanshokooh and Tahmasebi-Kohyani, 2012), Atlantic Salmon (Sissener et al., 2010; Morais et al., 2012), Gilthead seabream (Ibarz et al., 2010; Rufino-Palomares et al., 2011; Siva et al., 2012; Matos et al., 2013) or Diplodus sargus (de Vareilles et al., 2012).

On one hand, proteomics focussed on the \u2018parasite\u2019, trying to identify the expression pattern of parasites, which is particularly challenging because of their different development stages. A second research direction followed the \u2018host\u2019 aspect, thus focussing on the complex dynamics that underlie the interaction between host immune system and parasite. Most, if not all, parasite antigens utilize the change of surface post-translational modifications (PTM) to modulate and possibly evade the host immune response. PTM are involved in many important molecular recognition processes including invasion, adhesion, differentiation and development (Frenal et al., 2014). The advances in immunoproteomic techniques will provide new insights into the \u2018host\u2019 perspective of parasite infections, in particular for what concerns both innate immunity and biomarker discovery for diagnostic applications (Etebar et al., 2013, Hasnain et al., 2013).",

There has already been movement from the single-parameter biomarker strategy to the proteomic-based multi-parameter diagnostic approaches (Campos et al., 2012). However, metaproteomics, also known as the proteomics of the environment or of one particular community, is still an almost unexplored frontier to conquer in animal science. Metaproteomic analysis could provide identification and relative quantification of protein and protein families recovered directly from environmental samples or from a concrete ecosystem. This methodological approach aims to move from a functional understanding of a single species proteome elucidating the proteomic complexity from a larger community. Today, the latest MS technology in combination with sequencing capabilities and bioinformatic analysis has opened up new opportunities for translating metadata analysis into assessment of a health status (Erickson et al., 2012). There are several advantages to consider: (i) metaproteomics could offer a phenotypic profile on samples preserving the meta-species environment; (ii) alteration in the microbial ecosystem (saliva, digestive tract, mammalian glands) in farm animals would not only provide functional information for diagnosis but also aid in evaluating stress responses; (iii) it could be of great interest to evaluate gastrointestinal function in ruminant and gastrointestinal disorders. The main disadvantage is that the developments in metaproteomics would still be linked to growth, achievements and methodological developments of metagenomics. In conclusion, this powerful new methodology would provide a deeper understanding of the farm animal microbiota in the context of functional host\u2013microbe interactions and elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking the microbiome to host physiology. Proteomics and metaproteomic analysis are opening new opportunities for developing more robust and cost-effective diagnostics and prognostic methodologies.",

            "text": "Very limited proteomic research has so far been presented regarding quality control in chicken eggs. The literature is mainly focussed on \u2018egg\u2019 as a reproductive stage and not for its nutritional features. In particular, Qiu et al. (2012) investigated, through a 2DE-proteomic approach, the modification of egg proteins during storage. They described the differential proteome profile at three different storage temperatures (4\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C) for 15 days. The most important result obtained was the degradation of albumin in relation to higher temperature, with the formation of a lysozyme\u2013ovalbumin complex. Furthermore, the relative quantity of clusterin (apolipoprotein J) decreased with the same trend of increasing storage temperature, and it could, therefore, be used to assess egg quality. Another interesting paper (Rose-Martel et al., 2012) applied LC-MS/MS proteomics to investigate the eggshell cuticle proteome, which represents the real barrier against the external environment and as a defence against mainly bacterial assault. This study of the protein composition of egg cuticle represents a milestone and highlights several parameters that can be used to assess egg quality. This is particularly important as even partial damage to the cuticle exposes eggs to microbial contamination from food-borne pathogens. Among the 47 proteins identified, two major proteins \u2013 namely, a Kunitz-like protease inhibitor and ovocalyxyn 32 \u2013 are known to present antimicrobial functions. These findings may be relevant for prediction/selection of eggs with increased resistance to food-borne pathogens. As well as the protein composition of the shells, egg white protein has been examined by proteomics. Wang et al. (2012) used a combined 2DE and LC/MS/MS proteomic approach to explore relative differences of egg white proteins across six different egg varieties. They found for the first time a quiescence precursor protein in eggs, previously identified only in chicken mesenchymal and fibroblast cells. These authors concluded that the proteome of different egg varieties has the same components; however, the relative abundance of individual proteins does vary between the different egg varieties.",

            "text": "Several recent reviews have presented the application of proteomics in milk science, from description of a bovine PeptideAtlas (Bislev et al., 2012a) to milk production, as well as on the quality and safety of milk (Roncada et al., 2012). Some reports have also focussed their attention on the diagnostic value of milk proteomes in mastitis (Mansor et al., 2013). More recently, Calvano et al. (2013) described a rapid and sensitive method to detect adulteration in milk, in particular to detect mixtures of powdered milk in liquid milk, both in raw and processed products. The same results can be obtained with 2DE-based proteomic analysis, but MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis is a reliable and fast method for this purpose. In particular, they identified diagnostic peptides of powdered milk with sensitivity of <1%. Nissen et al. (2013) described a powerful combined prefractionation method to characterize the bovine milk proteome. Authors were able to identify new proteins, and their data were supported by ELISA validation. The combination of accurate prefractionation methods, 2D-based proteomics, LC-MS/MS and ELISA can efficiently overcome the problems of measuring minor milk protein components, despite the large dynamic range of milk proteomes. Caira et al. (2013) reviewed and described different typical peptides useful to detect different types of milk and adulterations through the detection of \u03b1\nS1-CN variants. Furthermore, they set up a flow injection analysis electrospray ionisation quadrupole TOF analysis before dephosphorylation of casein that could also be used to assess different Mediterranean breeds. Negative energy balance (NEB) in cattle directly influences milk composition, with respect to both proteins and lipids. Lu et al. (2013) applied a proteomic and metabolomic approach to study NEB in milk. These authors showed that milk from these cows has an increased quantity of acute-phase proteins, galactose\u20131\u2013phosphate and unsaturated fatty acid, in comparison with milk from cattle with a good energy balance. These observations have provided some insight into the potential mechanisms involving stomatin and galactose-1-phosphate in NEB dairy cow\u2019s milk and demonstrate a relationship between metabolism and the quality of milk.",

For example, Hinz et al. (2012) used a 2DE-based proteomic approach to correlate the differences in the proteolysis of milk proteins during lactation stages. The authors correlated the proteomic pattern of the relative production of cheddar cheese derived from different time points of the lactation stages. Interestingly, they identified some proteins that could be useful to assess seasonal quality. Wedholm et al. (2008) described protein markers of the cheese yield through proteomic analysis. In particular, they highlighted several proteins related to the production as a specific \u03b2-CN fragment, an isoform B of \u03b2 lactoglobulin, and other whey proteins as lactoferrin and vitamin D-binding proteins. However, the roles of these proteins were not completely explained. Regarding the role of casein fragments in poorly coagulating milk for cheese production, another interesting proteomic work has been published (Jensen et al., 2012). Reduced levels of phosphorylation of \u03b1\nS1-CN form (\u03b1\nS1-CN 8P) are related to poorly coagulating and non-coagulating milk, together with decreased levels of glycosylated \u03ba-CN forms.",

Proteomics in poultry has focussed on basically two fields of research, meat quality and the study of infectious diseases. Differences in raw and cooked poultry meats were determined by means of proteomics (Montowska and Pospiech, 2013), which also provided the tools to identify new protein markers associated with slow and fast growth rates of a different genetic line (Phongpa-Ngan et al., 2011). Proteomics was also useful to unravel the molecular basis of some protected designation of origin meat products, such as French foie gras or local chicken breeds (Zanetti et al., 2010 and 2011), paving the way for future application of proteomic techniques in food quality certification (Theron et al., 2011). The derangement of postmortem alteration such as those that drive to pale soft exudative meats can also be analysed by proteomics (Molette et al., 2003). Given the background of the growing sensitivity of consumers and of policy makers on animal welfare, future applications of proteomics for the identification of biomarkers of stress and welfare after transport, for example, or preslaughtering procedures, are also envisaged (Hazard et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The protein components in meat, meat-derived products and fish are the most important determining factors for the eating quality, although other components also add to the positive (or negative) effects of the food product. Although total protein amount is an important attribute of meat, the composition of proteins is even more important for the eating quality. This explains why proteomics has become increasingly used as a tool to describe, understand and improve protein-based foods during the last decade. This is also reflected by the increasing number of scientific review papers appearing in the field (Bendixen et al., 2005; Hollung et al., 2007; de Almeida and Bendixen, 2012; Paredi et al., 2013). The composition of proteins is partially determined by the genetics of the animals. It has been known for decades that specific genes influence meat quality, such as the calpain genes that have a major impact on meat tenderness, as recently reviewed (Warner et al., 2010). However, it is also well known that eating quality is strongly influenced by other ante- and postmortem factors. To understand product quality, it is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms involved and fundamentally to obtain knowledge about the protein composition. The conversion of muscle to meat is a complex sequence of events causing a gradual change spanning hours and days postmortem, depending on muscle type and species. For processed meat and meat products, other factors will also have an impact. Understanding how different factors influence the quality of the product will aid in the development of new procedures and practices for driving the postmortem development or product processing in the desired direction. There are several recent examples where proteomics has been used as a tool to explain food quality variation.",

The Casertana breeds grow slower and have more backfat and intramuscular fat than do fast growing and leaner breeds like the Large White (Zullo et al., 2003). The slower postmortem pH decline in meat from Casertana pigs and differences in metabolic rate were supported by the differences in protein abundances and levels of specific metabolites. Higher levels of glycolytic enzymes and increased lactate accumulation were observed in the Casertana breed. On the other hand, meat from the Large White had higher expression of genes involved in cell cycle and muscle growth, also supported by proteomics. Furthermore, the metabolomics studies revealed an increase in Glutathione and Glutathione disulphide in Large White compared with Casertana pigs.",

            "text": "Conversion of muscle to meat starts immediately after slaughter of the animal. Following slaughter, the muscle will use the remaining energy stored and the muscle proceeds into rigor mortis before proteolytic enzymes start to degrade the myofibres (reviewed in Huff Lonergan et al., 2010). Another important event is the onset of apoptosis (Ouali et al., 2006; Kemp et al., 2010; Hollung et al., 2014). All these events depend on external and internal factors and the rate of the specific events is both muscle and species specific. Postmortem changes in the porcine muscle proteome include both metabolic enzymes and myofibrillar proteins (Lametsch and Bendixen, 2001; Lametsch et al., 2003; Morzel et al., 2004). In addition, similar studies performed in beef show that many metabolic enzymes, cellular defence and stress proteins change in abundance postmortem (Jia et al., 2007; Laville et al., 2009). The proteome analyses support a shift in energy metabolism postmortem. Aerobic metabolism continues for a short period after slaughter in the muscle, demonstrated by increased abundance of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. The resulting production of lactate and protons contributes to the pH decline. Several studies have shown that the abundance of heat shock proteins (HSP) 27 and 70, both known inhibitors of apoptosis, is decreased (Picard et al., 2010; Guillemin et al., 2011b), eventually increasing apoptosis in postmortem muscle. For beef, tenderness is the most important eating quality parameter determined by consumers (Miller et al., 1995). The search for reliable markers of tenderness in beef using various proteomic approaches has been a major focus for several research groups over the last decade (Bjarnadottir et al., 2012; D\u2019Alessandro et al., 2012a and 2012b; Sierra et al., 2012). Several markers have been proposed, and these are involved in different biological pathways or functions such as myofibril structure, proteolysis, oxidative stress resistance, apoptosis or energy metabolism. Proteins belonging to the HSP27 and HSP70 families are among the most promising tenderness markers so far (Guillemin et al., 2011a), although these proteins are involved in a number of different cellular responses. In addition to their anti-apoptotic role, these proteins are protectors of myofibrillar proteins like desmin, actin, myosin and titin.",

Pioselli et al. (2011) observed significant differences in myofibrillar muscle protein composition of the exudates when using different salt concentrations and tumbling times. An initial salting step is also a central part of the processing when producing dry-cured hams. Proteins are released in the exudate formed in the initial salting step of Italian Parma ham production, and the processing conditions influence significantly the release of myofibrillar proteins in the exudate (Paredi et al., 2013). Skrlep et al. (2011) found a correlation between salt content and 45 proteins in the biceps femoris muscle of dry-cured ham. Most of these proteins belong to the myofibrillar protein fraction. Release of amino acids and peptides by proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins is important for taste and odour in dry-cured hams. Several peptides derived from actin, myosin light chain and creatine kinase are among the peptides released during ripening of Spanish dry-cured hams (Sentandreu et al., 2007; Mora et al., 2009a and 2009b; Escudero et al., 2013).",

As it is not possible here to review all the possible protocol variations, we want to highlight, in this section, the common key steps that need to be applied and controlled before proteomic analysis is undertaken and identify the limitations that can arise when dealing with such different starting materials.

            "text": "The reproducibility of results and therefore the number of replicates in a study is of major concern in proteomics as in all biological studies. Replicates should be sufficient to allow for both biological and technical variability. Statistical approaches have been described that take into account small sample numbers, which may be necessary in studies on farm animals (Schwammle et al., 2013). The amount of starting material and its heterogeneity need to be carefully evaluated according to the source of sample. For cell-culture experimentation, mean protein content per cell and number of cells have to be known, as well as protein concentration for biofluids. For tissue/biopsy analysis, the homogeneity of the samples is crucial and has to be comparable. An ideal scenario would be when proteomic investigation follows microdissection from histological sections, thus ensuring the tissue and cellular source of the sample. Total or selective protein extraction and purification should not introduce protein modifications, and endogenous enzymatic activities need to be prevented by adding inhibitors. Classic biochemical techniques combined with protein precipitation are widely used for sample preparation. Maximal protein solubilization and denaturation need to be achieved before applying chemical modifications to the proteins being analysed (disulphide bridges reduction/alkylation, labelling experiment, enzymatic digestion before LC-MS analysis). Exogenous proteins, labelled analogues or housekeeping proteins should be used as internal standards to assess methodological repeatability and reproducibility (Domon and Aebersold, 2010; Meng and Veenstra, 2011; Maiolica et al., 2012; Picotti and Aebersold, 2012).",

Gel-free techniques are generally more robust because they are completely automatized and directly applicable to a wide range of studies, as the enzymatic digestion of proteins into peptides leads to a more homogeneous set of molecules sharing similar properties. For both gel-based and gel-free approaches, the main analytical issues are the protein expression dynamics and complexity. When several enrichment methods help analyse targeted groups of proteins, the sample complexity is more dependent on the analytical power separation of the workflow used. Multidimensional separation techniques (2DE and 2D LC) coupled directly or not with MS can today identify and quantify about 4000 proteins (false discovery rate, 1%) per analysis hour covering 4 to 6 orders of protein abundance (Hebert et al., 2014). The new-generation MS can further increase the separation power by introducing additional separation in gas phase (IMS) or by dramatically increasing the speed acquisition, mass accuracy and mass resolution.",

As stated by F. Lottspeich, \u2018many peptides are identically found in functionally completely different proteins\u2019 (Lottspeich, 2009) \u2013 that is, a processed protein (cleaved protein, for example) is easily seen on a gel, whereas in the gel-free approach cleaved and non-cleaved proteins will give the same peptide pattern. At present, the most recent technical advance in the gel-based method is the difference gel electrophoresis or difference in gel electrophoresis, allowing the separation of two to three samples in a same gel and/or the use of an internal standard, thus improving the statistical reliability and decreasing the hurdle of reproducibility between gels. Excluding the use of litres of buffer (e.g. in the horizontal electrophoretic separation) and enabling the use of precast gels have been regarded as major advancements in the handling of gels. Besides the classical approach aiming at identifying proteins showing different levels of abundance when comparing multiple conditions, gels can be used for different aspects. This includes the detection of PTMs using specific staining and/or labelling procedures (Cerny et al., 2013), estimation of native protein activity, separation of native proteins, separation of complexes or supercomplexes from soluble or membrane proteins (Wittig and Schaegger, 2008) and validation of results using antibodies.",

            "text": "The shotgun approach aims at comparing complete proteomes in terms of protein abundances between different conditions without any a priori use of an LC-MS workflow. This analysis often called the discovery approach highlights a set of biomarkers that needs to be further validated by alternative methods. Label-based or label-free methods can be applied. When introduced early in the sample preparation, label-based methods are preferred for analyses that require extensive prefractionation/enrichment approaches, as lack of reproducibility of the above methods can be compensated for by a unique processing of the mixed sample. However, only a limited number of conditions can be analysed with such techniques. On the contrary, label-free methods are generally applied for large studies with a high number of samples to be analysed. With this approach, one should ensure that the whole analytical procedure is standardised and uses sufficient quality control standards for all critical steps (protein extraction/purification, protein digestion, LC-MS analysis) (Martinez-Bartolome et al., 2013). At the MS acquisition point of view, two main approaches exist. In one, the data-dependent acquisition implies an isolation in gas phase of each ion (peptide) to be further fragmented in tandem MS to collect peptide sequence information. The MS/MS speed acquisition directly limits the power of this approach, as just a part of the detected MS signals are selected for MS/MS sequencing. In addition, the lack of reproducibility of the selected ions for MS/MS acquisition induces loss of information when comparing several analyses. In another recent approach, data-independent acquisition was introduced to overcome these limitations. This acquisition mode is a parallel process where all MS signals are further submitted to MS/MS fragmentation without any precursor selection. This method has the advantage of acquiring all the information, therefore leading to higher acquisition reproducibility and the possibility of processing data completely and independently without having acquisition-dependent bias.",

This means that many proteins of immediate relevance to research and surveillance of farm animal health, such as cytokines and their receptors, have hardly ever been observed by shotgun proteomic analyses of samples such as bovine milk (Danielsen, et al., 2010; Boehmer, 2011). Moreover, because of the high cost and extensive instrument time required, typically only a relatively small number of biological replicates are analysed in global proteome experiments. Hence, much current focus has been on developing more selective and accurate methods for validating biomarkers and especially those that are present at low concentrations in samples. Furthermore, validation of methods for absolute quantification is essential for clinical as well as research applications in veterinary medicine or animal health studies. Absolute quantification is also necessary for correlating protein expression data across different biological samples, as well as across multiple experiments, instruments and laboratories, thus supporting more quantitative and hypothesis-driven proteome research.",

The SRM method is essentially based on tandem MS analyses, where only a few selected peptides (typically 2 to 4 peptides/protein), which are unique to the protein of interest, are measured. Typically, triple quadruple instruments are used because of their high selectivity and sensitivity of both parent and fragment ions. By scheduling the MS methods, improved sensitivity is achieved by analysing specific peptides only within their optimal retention time windows. Depending on the sensitivity and accuracy required, >100 peptides, signifying 30 to 50 specific proteins, can be targeted and measured in one single LC-SRM/MS analysis of a complex sample, loaded over a 30 to 60 min LC gradient online to the MS (Pan et al., 2009). Moreover, SRM methods cover a much wider dynamic range than shotgun-based MS (Kirkpatrick et al., 2005), and an added advantage is that absolute protein quantities can be measured by spiking in known amounts of heavy-labelled peptide analogues, whereby the absolute amounts of the targeted peptides in the biological samples can be calculated.",

SRM therefore provides a complementary and sometimes superior alternative approach to ELISA for biomarker validation, because of its high selectivity and specificity, low cost of reagents and the excellent capability of performing multiple assays in a single measurement (Pan et al., 2009). So far, only very few examples of the use of SRM methods in farm animal sciences have been presented. These have been limited to bovine studies, such as the analysis of milk samples, where an SRM approach was used to specifically quantify membrane proteins in the milk fat globule (Affolter et al., 2010), and a method paper that presented the quantotypic properties of a panel of known and potential bovine host response proteins studied in bovine udder samples from healthy as well as lipopolysaccharide-challenged cows (Bislev et al., 2012b).

Further schools have focussed on bioinformatics in order to enhance full interpretation of the output from separation and MS analysis. The most popular training schools in the COST action have been in the basic and advanced uses of bioinformatics covering MS data management and running of search engines; data format and existing toolboxes for converting, merging and preprocessing data from several sources (LC/MS-MS, iTraq, MALDI, etc.); the use of biological databases, such as UniProtKB, PeptideAtlas, Pfam and STRING; the creation of Perl or Python scripts; and an overview of protein\u2013protein interaction programmes. Overcoming the limited nature of genomes of species such as seabream and Atlantic salmon is one pivotal problem encountered in the interpretation of MS data for animal species. Indeed, ensuring that the bioinformatic tools are as advanced as possible for the analysis of protein and peptides from livestock and wild and farmed fish species would be a valuable asset in the development of proteomics for farm animals. It is also important that, as investigations in animal species develop, the repositories of data such as proteome maps and peptide atlases are collated, curated and integrated with ontology databases. Indeed, the Bioinformatics for FAP highlighted two important problems for the discipline. First, the increasing importance of studies on PTM of proteins and, second, the need to create specialized spectral libraries that would be the key to designing sensitive MS-based assays.

This action made possible one Reciprocal STSM (basically an STSM involving a European researcher who conducted a short stay in one of the reciprocal agreement COST countries: Australia, South Africa, Argentina and, in this particular case, New Zealand). The application process was straightforward, and the process from application to decision stage concluded very quickly. This brought together a Portuguese researcher\u2019s interest in seasonal weight loss with AgResearch expertise in wool fibre proteomics. The proposed research complemented NZ existing wool quality traits programme and provided the opportunity to examine the effect of diet restriction on the protein composition of wool. This collaboration was successfully concluded with the finding of significant differences between the animals fed control and restricted diets (Almeida et al.,\n2014). One of the other benefits of the COST researcher\u2019s visit was a vision on research interests in the form of a seminar, awareness of some of his other publications and numerous informal meetings, in addition to the establishment of future collaborations and also some important consultations and discussions on proteomics equipment and software issues.",

            "text": "There is thus a current wave of interest in the application of proteomics to animal research and it is important that the momentum gained is not dissipated but is captured to yield the maximum benefit possible. How can this be achieved? The equipment needed to deliver technology for proteomics is likely to remain expensive for the foreseeable future, with few animal science institutes being willing to devote resources exclusively to proteomics; thus, it is important that centres of proteomic expertise remain open for collaboration with animal research. With the increasing recognition of the importance of research impact to the wider community, such laboratories should become more amenable to collaboration as direct links to public benefit and research impact can be established. Proteomics can identify disease biomarkers and vaccine candidates for economically important diseases of livestock and fish in aquaculture, as well as play a major role in species authentication to reassure consumers of the veracity of food products on supermarket shelves. Many of these applications have commercial application and it can be expected that veterinary and animal diagnostics, along with vaccine and animal health product companies, will recognize the need to explore the proteome of blood and tissues from experimental or natural disease investigations in order to determine the roles and potential actions of bioactive proteins and peptides.",

The ubiquitous use of 1D electrophoresis based on the Laemmli polyacrylamide gel technique throughout biological research indicates the need for protein analysis. As the use and value of proteomics with greater separation and more accurate protein identification within animal species increases, the potential applications of the method in animal science will multiply. As this occurs, it is likely that both equipment and reagent manufacturers become more familiar with the sector. For instance, a common problem in examination of the serum proteome is the overabundance of the proteins with the highest concentration, such as albumin and immunoglobulins. Kit-based methods are available to remove the 20 most abundant proteins in human serum, but as the method is antibody based it does not work in domestic species. Production of kits for the major farm animals would be of significant benefit to biomarker discovery in these species.",

It is to be hoped that national and international funding bodies that allocate research funds will have the foresight to recognize that there is now a window of opportunity with technology. Expertise and motivation have been developed among a cohort of researchers to maximize the potential for future proteomic-based investigations. Among the active researchers who have demonstrated this potential, there is also a need to maintain the progress, especially after the COST Action on FAP is completed by November 2014. There is a need for the consortium to continue and to expand to include experts from beyond Europe either by formation of an Association or by linkage to an established group. Whatever happens there is no doubt that the use of proteomics in animal research has now gone beyond a few, isolated laboratories and can now be seen as a mainstream research tool of benefit across the spectrum of investigations into animal health, production and post-harvest processes. In particular, the natural continuation of our action will be realized through the presentation of the Horizon 2020 (H2020) research programme. One of the four pillars of H2020 is dedicated to food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime and inland water research, in which proteomic investigation is perfectly integrated. Moreover, these activities are transversal so that the results and networking produced from the COST action will open novel lines of enquiry in the light of one health approach that links human to animal medicine, which is one of the hot topics within the H2020 themes.",

In the gel-free approach, the whole protein extracts are digested with trypsin, separated using chromatography and proteins of interest identified and quantified using high-throughput MS instruments. The latter approach is particularly suitable for species with reasonable coverage levels in databases (cattle, pig, sheep, chicken and salmon).",
