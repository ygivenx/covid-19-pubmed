Binding of IFN to the IFN receptor activates a signaling cascade that leads to the transcriptional activation of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode proteins with diverse biological function where some are potent antiviral proteins and part of the response against mammalian viruses (1). The antiviral function of ISGs is only partially understood. However, it is well accepted that ISGs target different steps in the virus life cycle ranging from cell entry, virus protein translation, genome replication, and exit of virus particles (reviewed in reference 2).",

These are small (\u223c50-nm), spherical, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. It is well known that the type I IFN response is crucial for restricting different flaviviruses, and several ISGs have been identified to restrict flavivirus growth. However, very little is known about how specific ISGs target the assembly and release of virions. Prior to the assembly of virions, a single polyprotein is translated from the viral RNA genome. The polyprotein is cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins. Although the nonstructural proteins promote genomic replication and assembly, the three structural proteins\u2014capsid (C), prM/M (membrane and its precursor), and envelope (E)\u2014form the viral particles (3). The C proteins of all flaviviruses are highly basic, which gives them the ability to bind the viral genomic RNA to form a nucleocapsid, which buds into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acquiring a host-derived lipid bilayer coated by the membrane-bound glycoproteins prM and E (4\u20136). From the ER, the virion is transported along the secretory pathway toward the Golgi compartment, where the maturation of carbohydrate groups on prM and E, as well as the cleavage of prM to M, occurs (7). Finally, the mature virion is released by exocytosis (reviewed in reference 3).",

            "text": "Two major ISGs, tetherin and viperin (virus inhibitory protein, ER associated, IFN inducible), have been shown to affect assembly and release of viruses (reviewed in reference 2). Tetherin is encoded by the ISG BST2 and is localized within lipid rafts on the cell surface, in the trans-Golgi compartment, and/or within recycling endosomes (8, 9). It inhibits release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral particles by anchoring the virion to the plasma membrane (10), leading to internalization and degradation (11, 12). Viperin, encoded by the ISG RSAD2, is highly induced in an IFN-dependent or -independent manner (as reviewed previously [13]). Viperin is located to the cytoplasmic side of the ER (14) and has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against many different enveloped viruses, e.g., DENV, West Nile virus, TBEV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1, influenza A virus, Sindbis virus, Chikungunya virus, and human cytomegalovirus (13, 15\u201324). Viperin interferes with HIV-1 and influenza A virus budding from the plasma membrane. It binds and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, leading to altered fluidity of lipid rafts, thereby interfering with virus budding (21, 22). Viperin also inhibits genome replication of DENV and HCV by interacting with viral nonstructural proteins (15, 16, 23). The antiviral mechanism(s) of action are poorly understood for most viruses and seem to be dependent on the virus. However, viral or cellular proteins important in the viral life cycle are often sequestered by viperin (21, 23, 25).",

However, very little is known about the effect of IFN on particle assembly and egress of flaviviruses. To study viral particle release, we established an expression system that allows the generation of virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the structural proteins C, prM, and E (Fig. 1A) (26). This system enabled us to study the secretion of VLPs into the supernatant of transfected A549 cells (Fig. 1B). To test the influence of IFN-\u03b1, we compared intracellular and extracellular abundance of flavivirus protein and particles in presence or absence of recombinant IFN-\u03b1B/D (Fig. 1B). The effect of IFN treatment on particle assembly was measured by quantifying the ratio between secreted E and C proteins (VLP) and E and C proteins in the cell lysate (Lysate). Surprisingly, compared to control treatment, IFN-\u03b1B/D treatment led to a strong increase in C protein release, while the secretion of E protein remained unaltered (Fig. 1B). Flavivirus C protein has not previously been described to be secreted separately from the other structural proteins. To test this, only TBEV C protein was expressed in A549 cells and found to be sufficient for protein release (Fig. 1C). Again, treatment of transfected cells with IFN-\u03b1B/D led to an increase of C protein secreted to the supernatant (Fig. 1C). Collectively, this suggested that type I IFN affect the viral structural proteins differently, indicating that C and E proteins are secreted by different mechanisms.",

The C protein detected in the supernatant could be released from cells as soluble proteins, protein aggregates, or membrane-associated proteins. To characterize the nature of the secreted C protein, a flotation assay was performed. C protein floated up and behaved (Fig. 2A, first row) in the same manner as Langat virus (LGTV; a low-virulence member of the TBEV serogroup, which has been used extensively as a nonpathogenic models for TBEV) and VLPs containing prM and E (Fig. 2A). This showed that the C protein released from cells was membrane associated. After the addition of detergent, the C protein was mainly found in the pellet (Fig. 2A, second row, fraction 6), confirming the membrane association. Analysis of the enriched C-particle fraction using electron microscopy revealed particles with a round morphology similar to LGTV and VLPs containing C, prM, and E (Fig. 2B).",

            "text": "It is generally assumed that flavivirus virions assemble in the ER and exit via the conventional secretory pathway (7, 27), and lipid droplets have been suggested to play a role in DENV encapsidation (28). However, to gain further information on the exact localization of TBEV C protein, we performed confocal analysis of cells transfected with plasmid encoding C-FLAG. The C protein was found in the nucleus and colocalized with E and the ER marker calnexin (ER) but not with GM130 (Golgi matrix protein) and was only in some cells associated with lipid droplets (Fig. 3A and B). To specifically block COPII-mediated transport from the ER toward the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) and Golgi compartment, a dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 (Sar1-H79G) was overexpressed, together with prME or C, and progeny particles were monitored. The Sar1 mutant binds to the ER and initiate the COPII coat protein recruitment but is not able to detach from the ER, thereby blocking ER-to-Golgi-compartment transport (29). The overexpression of Sar1-H79G blocked both prME-particle and C-particle release (Fig. 3C and D), suggesting that COPII-mediated anterograde transport is involved in the release of C particles. Next, the cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA), which blocks both retrograde transport via COPI vesicles and the secretion from the trans-Golgi compartment via clathrin-coated vesicles and subsequently causes disruption of the Golgi apparatus (30). This leads to a collapse of the Golgi compartment into the ER and thereby blocks the release of proteins via this pathway (31). BFA efficiently inhibited the secretion of prME particles (Fig. 3E). However, BFA increased the secretion of C particles similar to the IFN treatment (Fig. 3F and Fig. 1C).",

Direct comparison of viperin to the \u03941-50 mutant identified 34 proteins that were significantly more enriched in the wt protein precipitates compared to precipitations with the mutant protein (Fig. 6D, red and green dots). Ciao1 identified previously (19) is comparably well enriched by wt viperin and \u03941-50 mutant, suggesting that the immunoprecipitation (IP) conditions were similar overall. As additional filter method we considered the subcellular localization of these proteins using annotations based on the Human Protein Atlas. This analysis showed that the majority proportion of candidates localized to the nucleus. However, three proteins ARL1 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 1), RCN2 (ERC-55; ER Ca2+ binding protein, 55 kDa), and GBF1 (Fig. 6D, green dots) were annotated to localize to the ER or the Golgi compartment. Of these proteins, ARL1 has been reported to regulate intracellular trafficking between the plasma membrane, endosomes, and the trans-Golgi compartment (32). RCN2 has been shown to be a chaperone in the ER and involved in signal transduction (33). GBF1 is a GTP-exchange factor (GEF), which is involved in COPI trafficking. BFA treatment is known to inhibit COPI-coated vesicle formation by binding to and stabilizing the GBF1-ARF1-GDP complex (34). Since BFA induces C-particle secretion (Fig. 3F), the positive effect of viperin on C-particle release could be explained by GBF1 targeting. We therefore set out to further study the interaction between viperin and GBF1. The interaction between viperin and GBF1 could be confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of both transiently transfected and of endogenous GBF1 (Fig. 6E and F). Mapping of the interaction domain revealed that the 50 first amino acids of viperin containing the amphipathic alpha-helix were important for the binding GBF1 (Fig. 6G), further confirming the mass spectrometry data.",

Live cell imaging analysis of mCherry-viperin and eGFP-GBF1 showed that eGFP-GBF1 localized to vesicular structures surrounded by viperin (Fig. 7A). The colocalization between GBF1 and the N-terminal 1 to 50 amino acids of viperin in such structures was even more pronounced (Fig. 7B), confirming the coimmunoprecipitation results and suggesting a critical role of the viperin N terminus in these assays. The steady-state distribution of GBF1, together with the Golgi marker GM130, was not altered in the presence of viperin (Fig. 7C). To clarify whether the function of GBF1 is involved in C-particle secretion, we used a specific GBF1 inhibitor, Golgicide. Cells transfected with plasmids expressing C-FLAG and/or viperin were treated with Golgicide, and the effect on C protein release was evaluated by immunoblotting as described before. Notably, the inhibition of GBF1 by Golgicide strongly induced secretion of C particles, especially in the presence of viperin (Fig. 7D). Importantly, no effect of Golgicide was detected on prME secretion (Fig. 7E), confirming a selective function of GBF1 in flavivirus protein release. To test the functional relationship between viperin and GBF1, the production of C particles was analyzed during modulated cellular levels of GBF1 and in the presence of viperin (Fig. 7F). Viperin-induced increase of C-particle release could be inhibited by overexpression of YFP-GBF1, and transient knockdown of GBF1 with CRISPR Cas9 induced the C-particle release (Fig. 7F), confirming a functional interaction between viperin and GBF1 and, in addition, the importance of GBF1 in the assembly of TBEV.",

Viperin has been shown to target the ER membrane via its N-terminal amphipathic helical domain (14, 19). This domain has also been found to induce crystalloid ER and thereby rearranging the smooth ER membranes into a lattice-like pattern (14). We demonstrate here that the enhanced secretion of C protein by viperin was dependent on its N terminus and binding to GBF1. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of viperin seems to be very important for viperin function since the numbers of cellular proteins interacting with the mutant lacking the amphipathic helix were very low (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). This indicates that the intracellular localization of viperin to the ER membrane or the N-terminal itself is important for protein-protein interaction. This domain in viperin is also important for the inhibition of Chikungunya virus (18), TBEV (19), and HCV (16) and directly mediates the binding to GBF1. GBF1 normally regulates membrane dynamics in the secretory pathway, and most RNA viruses rely on cellular vesicular trafficking for proper intracellular localization of viral proteins. GBF1 is important in the life cycles of several different viruses: GBF1 is necessary for RNA replication of DENV, HCV, and SARS coronavirus (35\u201337), for particle assembly of Ebola virus and influenza A virus (38, 39), and for targeting of DENV C protein to lipid droplets, which is important for DENV infection (36, 42). An interaction between DENV C protein and the N-terminal of viperin has been shown (15). This interaction occurred at the interface of lipid droplets (15), a hub for DENV assembly (28). Interestingly, a physical interaction between viperin and TBEV C protein could not be detected and thus might not be necessary for the induced secretion of C particles. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of viperin localized to vesicular structures, together with GBF1 in agreement that this region is sufficient to target GBF1. It can be envisaged that modulation of GBF1 by viperin would potentially modulate all of the above-mentioned functions both in the presence and in the absence of interaction between viperin and viral proteins and therefore constitute a widely used mechanism to impair virus spread.",

A similar type of hydrophobic membrane association of the C protein has been suggested for DENV, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus (44, 45) and even tick-borne flaviviruses (LGTV, Powassan, and TBEV). Notably, the C protein appears to have an intrinsic ability in vitro to assemble into particles even in the absence of membranes (46, 47). However, assembly and release of capsid particle in cell culture have not been previously reported for flaviviruses. Interestingly, naked capsid-like HCV particles have been reported in vivo (48\u201350), raising the possibility that viperin might be involved in inducing secretion of such capsid-like HCV particles. We found that the membrane association of the TBEV capsid particles was quite sensitive to mechanical stress; therefore, it could be that the HCV C particles are also secreted with a membrane that is lost shortly after cellular release. HCV C particles are taken up by clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human hepatoma cells (48, 51) and can induce an immune response by modifying specific phenotypic and functional markers in T cells (52). TBEV C particles may have a similar immune modular capacity. A potential antiviral purpose of C-particle secretion could be multifarious ranging from being a side product of disturbed viral assembly, thereby reducing the overall infectivity, to having paracrine or endocrine functions, as reported for HCV (48, 52).",

The eGFP-GBF1-wt plasmid was generated from the YFP-GBF-wt plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis. The pIRES DsRed2 Sar1 H79G (active mutant) plasmid (55) was kindly provided by Hirofumi Kai, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan. The mCherry-viperin was constructed by lifting viperin from pI.18 into a mCherry backbone. Transfection was performed with Nanofectin (PAA) or GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol; the transfection efficiency ranged between 40 and 80%.",

HeLa cells were transfected with C-FLAG and increasing amounts of viperin (0.75, 1.5, 3, and 6 \u03bcg). (D) Morphology of C-FLAG particles by transmission electron microscopy. Supernatants from cells transfected with C-FLAG and viperin were harvested, concentrated using a flotation assay, and analyzed by negative staining after glutaraldehyde fixation. Scale bar, 100 nm. A representative picture is shown. (E) Schematic drawing of viperin mutants. (F) Secretion of C protein in the presence of wt and viperin mutants. HeLa cells were transfected with wt, \u03941-50, \u0394341-361, and mutant M1, together with plasmid encoding C\u2013FLAG. (G) Dose-independent release of C protein in the presence of mutant \u03941-50. Increasing amounts of plasmid expressing \u03941-50 were transfected into HeLa cells, together with C-FLAG. C protein release was measured with or without wt viperin expression. Representative blots are shown; graphs show the quantification (means and standard deviations from n = 3 [B and C] and n = 2 [F and G] Western blot experiments), where C in the supernatant is normalized to C in the lysate.",

(A) Schematic representation of an affinity purification/MS strategy. N-terminal FLAG-tagged viperin, \u03941-50 mutant, and GFP (as control) were expressed by tet treatment of 293 FLP-IN T-Rex cells that contained a stably integrated transgene or not expressed when tet was omitted. Cells were lysed under mild lysis conditions, and proteins were precipitated using FLAG beads. After precipitation and extensive washing, the proteins were digested with trypsin and LysC, and the peptides were purified and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
