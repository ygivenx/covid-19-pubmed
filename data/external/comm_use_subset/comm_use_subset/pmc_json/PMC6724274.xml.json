Despite implementation of neonatal newborn screening programs in some countries and improvement in patient care over the last few years, CF-related lung disease remains the main cause of morbidity-mortality in these patients. The role of bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) has been extensively studied for several decades whereas the respiratory viruses pathogenesis remained little explored. The availability of new diagnostic molecular tests to detect virus infections has recently boosted the interest in evaluating their impact during pathological conditions such as CF in children [1\u20139] and in adults [10\u201315].",

Some studies conducted in the late 1980s and 1990s have drawn a pessimistic scenario of viral RTIs in this vulnerable population that is no longer observed. In these seminal studies, clinical manifestations were described as severe, frequently requiring hospitalization and prolonged oxygen supply or mechanical ventilation [16\u201318]. Some patients were described as acquiring pathogens such as PA in the weeks or months following RTI [18, 19]. At that time, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found to be the most frequently recovered virus, but diagnostic tools were limited to immunological assays and viral culture, thus limiting the spectrum of virus that may be recovered. Recent studies have shown that RSV epidemics may be associated with the occurrence of more pulmonary exacerbations [20], but RSV is rarely responsible for hospitalization because of respiratory events in CF patients [21, 22].",

As already reported [23] we thought that proper nasal sampling and filling out diaries by parents may be difficult to perform repeatedly over a long period of time; chest physiotherapists were therefore involved in the study to take nasal samples and recognize RTIs. Parents and chest physiotherapists were instructed to recognize RTI using a modified clinical score already used in a previous study conducted by van Ewijk and al in young children with CF [9]. There, the score was systematically performed twice weekly by parents, while in our study it was used on request by parents and physiotherapists to detect or confirm a possible RTI episodes revealed by the occurrence of symptoms. Briefly, Upper and Lower respiratory tract infection (URTI and LRTI) symptoms as well as general signs such as fever were recorded and a score calculated. In case of doubt, parents could ask the research nurse (by phone) or their chest physiotherapist (during the home visit) to confirm their findings. When the score was over 2, a nasal sample was collected at home by the chest physiotherapist within a maximum 3 days after the beginning of the symptoms, or at the center when the episode was coinciding with a visit.",

A consortium has been set up between the USA and Australia to precisely evaluate the impact of early respiratory viral infections in young children with CF (NCT01973192). We found that a mean 3.4 RTI episodes occurred in our patients over 1 year; the maximum number of RTIs recorded was seven in one patient. This frequency is in accordance with data reported by Collinson et al. in the late 1990s (3.4 URTIs per year in children under 6 years of age) using cultural or serological tools [18], but is half the 3.8 episodes identified using PCR over the 6 winter months reported by van Ewijk et al. in a population of children with CF who were a mean 3.5 years old [9]. The most recent data published by the Swiss group did not provide a precise RTI frequency calculation because their methodology differed from ours [6]. The reason for the LRTI frequency reported in our study likely stems from the scoring system itself and the way we used it for the purposes of the study. This so-called \u201crespiratory illness\u201d scoring system was developed by van Ewijk et al. for parents for self-recording of URTI and/or LRTI clinical symptoms. This clinical score was systematically measured twice weekly. In the present study, because of the high risk of errors in filling in the diary or giving up over a longer period of time (12 months vs. 6 in the van Ewijk et al. study), we chose not to use it on a systematic basis, but rather as an aid for both parents and home caregivers to detect RTIs and launch nasal sampling. Furthermore, it appears that some RTI episodes may have been missed using this score, particularly mild URTIs.",

Since the spread of molecular diagnostic tools, many studies have reported the same results in older children [1, 4, 6, 9, 15, 25, 26], adolescents and adults [3, 10, 11, 15]. Overall, RV/EV are responsible for 70\u201380% of virally induced RTIs. However, we were more intrigued by the few RSV infections detected. Six patients were infected by RSV at a mean age of 14 \u00b1 6.4 months; none required hospitalization, and even in the youngest patients, the clinical course was uncomplicated. These findings contrast with those reported decades ago in unscreened CF babies in whom RSV infection was described as severe (requiring oxygen supply or invasive ventilation) in three out of seven patients (43%) [16, 17, 27]. The overall better health status of the children with CF in the present sample is likely the main explanation for this result, as well as their older age at the time of RSV infection. These results are particularly interesting in terms of RSV infection prevention and subsequent clinical trials. Our population of patients was palivizumab-free. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the use of palivizumab in CF for targeted patients, particularly those with poor nutritional status or with several siblings [28]. We speculate that precautions and preventive measures (hand washing, family daycare attendance, avoidance of virally infected individuals, etc.) followed by parents (on medical advice and on their own initiative) may be efficient enough to reduce virus circulation around these patients.",

In a recent study conducted in a mean of 3.5 years old (range, 0\u201317 years) CF patients population sampled weekly for 6 months, the authors found that patients with CF had a more frequent and prolonged carriage of RV in comparison to their healthy counterparts, even if the subtypes did not differ [4].

The risk factor that RTI represents for PA colonization was underlined several years ago, particularly after a severe episode of RTI [17, 27]. Furthermore, major pathogen acquisition in young children with CF (PA, SA, Achromobacter xylosoxidans) may follow seasonality, underpinning the concept of predisposing seasonal environmental factors such as respiratory virus epidemics [30, 31]. However, the trend identified herein for SM seems somewhat new and will need further attention.
