This may be attributed to the model structure (structural identifiability) or due to the lack of information in a given dataset, which could be associated with the number of observations and the spatial-temporal resolution of the data [23, 24]. Because the time series of incident cases in the observed epidemic wave is an aggregation of the overlapping sub-epidemics, different sub-epidemic profiles may give rise to indistinguishable aggregated epidemic waves. This can happen if the parameters are correlated and different combinations of parameters result in the same fit of the data but have different forecasts. For a given epidemic wave, the number of sub-epidemics could be correlated with the size of individual sub-epidemics and parameter Cthr which sets the timing of the subsequent sub-epidemic. For example, given a fixed sub-epidemic size, as Cthr increases, a smaller number of sub-epidemics can be fit to the epidemic wave.",

Briefly, the curve of crude incidence by date of symptom onset was adjusted for reporting delays using a nonparametric method that adapts survival analysis and life table techniques for use with right truncated data [36, 37]. This epidemic has become the second largest Ebola outbreak in history with 1186 reported cases as of April 11, 2019, despite active ring vaccination efforts in the region [34]. The outbreak was first reported on August 1, 2018, by the WHO, spreading in the urban areas of the provinces of North Khivu and Ituri in the northeast region that borders Uganda [38]. Unfortunately, armed conflict in the Ebola-affected zone is hindering rapid response activities including case detection, contact tracing, isolation, and vaccination. Prolonged transmission has been primarily attributed to poor infection control practices in healthcare settings, delays in case detection and isolation, community resistance, and violent attacks targeting health workers and health centers [38]. For each model, we conducted a total of 19 forecasts from week 8 to week 26 of the epidemic. We assessed 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks ahead forecasts.",

Indeed, in large susceptible populations and in the absence of control interventions, traditional SIR compartmental models with homogenous mixing predict unabated exponential growth during the early epidemic growth phase in the absence of susceptible depletion and control interventions or behavior changes. Moreover, when calibrated with the trajectory of the initial growth phase, traditional models (e.g., logistic growth type models) tend to predict a near immediate decline in the epidemic trajectory [19] while our epidemic wave model forecasts traveling waves of variable shapes including resurgent epidemics stemming from the aggregation of asynchronous sub-epidemics [45].

More importantly, a real-time temporary downturn in case incidence resulting from oscillatory behavior could give the false impression of a positive effect of public health interventions.",

For instance, in real-time epidemic forecasting applications, it could be possible to relax the assumptions regarding the regularity in the timing and evolution of sub-epidemic sizes in our model by relying on additional data stemming from field investigations. For instance, additional data could inform the timing and relative size of unfolding sub-epidemics. Furthermore, future work could investigate the forecasting performance of the sub-epidemic model with that of mechanistic models developed for specific diseases and contexts. Among mechanistic models, one could consider metapopulation transmission models that integrate sub-epidemics shaped by dynamic transmission rates or effective population sizes that fluctuate due to interventions or behavior changes.",
