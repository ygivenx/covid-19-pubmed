However, the number of CD34+ cells for each session of tandem HDCT/auto-SCT could be lower than in single HDCT/auto-SCT because about half of the collected stem cells are infused during each HDCT/auto-SCT session. In addition, the second HDCT/auto-SCT could require a longer time for hematologic recovery than the first HDCT/auto-SCT, even when similar numbers of CD34+ cells are infused [17]. These findings suggest that infectious complications might be more frequent or severe in the second HDCT/auto-SCT than in the first, but studies addressing infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT have been limited. Accordingly, we investigated infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT.",

Bacteremia was defined as isolation of a bacterial pathogen from at least one set of blood cultures (one aerobic and one anaerobic) drawn from a patient. For coagulase-negative staphylococci and corynebacteria, isolation from at least two sets of blood cultures with the same antibiogram was required. Septic shock was defined as bacteremia with hypotension or the use of inotropic agents. Urinary tract infection (UTI) was defined by urinary symptoms and/or a fever and a hospital record of a positive urine culture. A positive urine culture was defined as the growth of \u2265105 colony-forming unit/mL of a single organism in midstream or bag urine specimens. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) required the presence of diarrhea (defined as \u22653 unformed stools in 24 hours) or radiographic evidence of ileus or toxic megacolon and a positive stool test result for toxigenic Clostridium difficile or its toxins, or colonoscopic or histopathologic findings demonstrating pseudomembranous colitis [18]. Any Gram-negative isolate that exhibited resistance to at least two antibiotics used in empirical therapy (third and fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems or piperacillin-tazobactam) was defined as MDR. From November 2008, patients with fever, respiratory symptoms or chest radiologic abnormalities were tested by the Seeplex multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) for 6 respiratory viruses (RVs): rhinovirus (RhV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), and influenza virus (IV). RVs were categorized into 2 groups according to the symptomatology and clinical outcome. The low-risk RV group included RhV and CoV, and the high-risk RV group included RSV, PIV, AdV, and IV. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease was diagnosed according to the published recommendations [19]. Invasive fungal infection (IFI) was defined with the criteria set by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group [20].",

From June 2011 onwards, we changed the antibiotic strategy; cefepime was the first-line agent, teicoplanin and cefepime were used for second-line therapy, and teicoplanin and meropenem were used as third-line agents. From October 2004 to April 2008, antifungal agents were used prophylactically or empirically and no antifungal agent was used in some patients. However, all patients received antifungal prophylaxis (fluconazole, itraconazole, or micafungin) after May 2008. All antibiotics including antifungal agents were discontinued after three consecutive days of no significant fever (<37.5\u00b0C), no evidence of documented or clinically suspected infection, and an absolute neutrophil count exceeding 0.5 \u00d7 109/L, with exception of prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis jiroveci.

Of 53 RV infections, upper respiratory infection (URI) developed in 26 (49.1%), lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in 13 (24.5%), and no respiratory symptoms developed in 14 (26.4%) cases. Detected RVs and clinical characteristics during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT are summarized in Fig 1A and 1B. The incidence of LRTI was higher in the high-risk RV group than in the low-risk RV group (43.5% versus 10.0%, p = 0.005, Fig 1C). Two patients died from RSV and AdV pneumonia. VZV reactivation occurred in 15 (2.5%) HDCT/auto-SCTs, which included 11 localized zoster, 3 disseminated zoster without visceral involvement, and 1 varicella. CMV disease developed in 2 (0.3%) patients, which included retinitis and enterocolitis.",

This study evaluated infectious complications in 324 patients with high-risk solid tumors, 283 of whom underwent tandem HDCT/auto-SCT, over a 10-year period in a single institue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of children and adolescents who underwent tandem HDCT/auto-SCT. In general, the frequency and severity of infectious complications in our cohort were similar to those in a cohort of 320 children and adolescents at the St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (SJCRH), most of whom underwent single HDCT/auto-SCT [21]. We initially hypothesized infectious complications might be more frequent or severe in the second HDCT/auto-SCT than in the first HDCT/auto-SCT. In contrast, we found that episodes of fever were more frequent and the proportion of cases using second-line antibiotics was higher in the first HDCT/auto-SCT than in the second. Otherwise, there was no difference in infection parameters between the first and second HDCT/auto-SCT. In the multivariate analysis for risk factors of infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT, inclusion of TBI and/or thiotepa which frequently causes severe mucositis, was a significant high-risk factor; however, the second HDCT/auto-SCT (compared to the first HDCT/auto-SCT) was not a significant factor. Collectively, these findings suggest that the second HDCT/auto-SCT does not increase the severity of infectious complications compared to the first, and that the severity of infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT might be associated with HDCT regimens rather than the number of HDCTs.",

This incidence of bacteremia might be acceptable considering the nature of treatment and the usual prognosis for tumors included in this study; however, the MDR bacteremia might be a significant clinical problem [10,23]. In this study, the incidence of MDR bacteria, particularly ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, appeared to increase over time, and four patients died from MDR bacterial infection.

However, in some patients, RV infection might persist for a long time without symptoms, as seen in our study. Significant delay of HDCT/auto-SCT until viral clearing might increase the risk of tumor progression, so clinicians might have to determine when to start HDCT/auto-SCT in these patients. In this study, 14 RV-positive patients without respiratory symptoms proceeded to HDCT/auto-SCT, because RV did not disappear during the waiting period. Eight of them experienced clinical respiratory infection including 2 LRTIs; however, there was no mortality. This study showed that the incidence of LRTI was relatively low (10.0%) in low-risk RV infection and there were no cases of mortality. Taken together, these findings suggest that patients with low-risk RV infection prior to HDCT/auto-SCT could proceed to HDCT/auto-SCT with relatively low-risk of severe respiratory infection, when the risk of tumor progression is high. However, for patients with high-risk RV infection, careful consideration is needed to determine when to start HDCT/auto-SCT.",
