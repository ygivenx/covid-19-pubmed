One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, where diseases are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. These include infections transmitted indirectly between hosts via a surface or reservoir intermediate\u2014often abiotic\u2014where the pathogen lives freely and independently of a host [1\u201318], sometimes described as \u2018sit and wait\u2019 infections [19]. Other studies have focused on systems where pathogens are growing in the environment [9], or have explored indirectly transmitted infections in theoretical terms [12,15]. While frameworks already exist for studying indirect environmental transmission, most are engineered with constraints that render their application necessarily narrow [6], limiting their relevance for a wider number of indirectly transmitted infections.",

            "text": "One class of diseases where the indirect transmission paradigm has been scarcely applied are those spread through injection drug use in urban settings, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). HIV has been the object of many important mathematical models [20,21], some of which have implemented injection drug use effectively, even focusing on the specific dynamics of injection equipment [22\u201325]. HCV has also been studied using modelling methods, many focusing on treatment [26\u201328] and others on the particulars of transmission in injection drug-user communities [29\u201335]. Importantly, none of these existing dynamical models consider the peculiar ecology of HCV transmission, where transmission events occur through an environmental reservoir (injection equipment) that resembles a disease vector [36,37]. Unlike an insect vector, however, injection equipment is not an organism and is more realistically considered an abiotic reservoir for infection, similar to the role that the water supply serves in an outbreak of cholera or other waterborne diseases [38]. As HCV continues to pose a serious public health challenge in many communities, there is a need to understand how the dynamics of injection equipment influence HCV transmission. This is especially important for informing the utility of harm reduction programmes, such as needle exchange, which have been effective in decreasing transmission of HIV and HCV [39,40]. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the urgency for understanding these dynamics has increased dramatically in recent years with the growth of the modern opioid epidemic, much of it involving injection drug use [41,42]. The lack of models of HCV that specifically consider injection equipment, and increased social urgency related to the modern opioid epidemic implore more adaptable mathematical models of injection-drug use that could facilitate a better understanding of and predictions for the trajectory of modern HCV infections.",

As HCV epidemics are partly defined by injection drug users and injection drug equipment, we argue that this indirectly transmitted lens captures aspects that prior models have not. In \u00a72, we introduce a theoretical iteration of an indirectly transmitted infection using a standard epidemiological model imbued with an environmental reservoir compartment. We describe analytic equations of such a system, and derive the reproductive number (R0) using analytic methods. Then in \u00a73, we introduce the full HCV mathematical model, demonstrating how it allows one to examine several otherwise-overlooked features of disease dynamics. We pontificate on these results in light of the ecology of infectious diseases, and in terms of public health policies, especially as they relate to the modern opioid epidemic.",

While R0 can have different theoretical formulations, we rely on definitions as provided by Jones [43] and Diekmann et al. [44]. In a density-dependent SIR model with constant birth of susceptible hosts \u03c0S and death rate proportional to the host population \u2212\u03bcS, the R0 value is given by2.6R0SIR=\u03b2\u03c0S\u03bd\u03bc,or sometimes, more simply, R0SIR=\u03b2/\u03bd, depending on the form of the SIR equations used, e.g. frequency-dependent, constant population, etc. In this equation, \u03b2 is the traditional transmission coefficient. It represents the coupling strength between infected and uninfected hosts, two non-environmental agents. Whereas, in the W.A.I.T. model, what is analogous to \u03b2 is a pair of parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, which govern the interaction strengths between hosts and the environment. \u03c0S, \u03bc and \u03bd have the same interpretation as in the W.A.I.T. model.",

Next, one notices that the \u03b2 factor in the SIR formula is augmented by the additional factor \u03b1 in the W.A.I.T. formula, representing a kind of shared dependence between the couplings controlling the I-interaction (\u03b1) and the S-interaction (\u03b2) with the environment.

In this case, the two appear as a ratio under the square root, as opposed to a product in the \u03b1\u03b2 case, indicating that whereas \u03b1 and \u03b2 contribute to R0 in the same way, \u03c0S and \u03c0W contribute in opposite ways: when \u03c0S is increased, R0 increases, but when \u03c0W is increased, R0 decreases.",

We denote the former by R0H and the latter by R0W (H for hosts and W for the W.A.I.T. compartment).

This would apply to settings where viral decay on a needle is high, or when infected needles are directly exchanged for uninfected ones (as in certain needle exchange programmes). The model is run with all uninfected populations initialized at their DFE values (S = 170 000 and Nu = 220 000), and we initialize IE = Nu = 1, and IL = 0. In the high \u03f5 scenario, we observe generally slower dynamics and higher overall susceptible population sizes, along with lower infected populations (on long time scales).\n",

Prior models of injection equipment have focused on HIV [24,25], and/or been so complicated that their structure is not easily translated to any other settings [23]. In this study, we model HCV as an indirectly transmitted infection, where the injection equipment is modelled as the environmental reservoir, just as a water source might be modelled in a waterborne infection [8,19]. We label our approach as the W.A.I.T. model, one that incorporates features of other approaches to studying environmentally transmitted pathogens [6,11], but grounding them in a flexible model that can be neatly applied to HCV. Our approach offers several specific insights. For example, we demonstrate that the composite R0 that defines the entire dynamical system is the geometric mean of R0 values used to describe each of two sub-components: disease flow through the hosts and flow through the injection equipment (equation (3.7)). This observation offers a practical suggestion for studying diseases like HCV: epidemiologists and modellers must understand, through empirical studies, properties of all major actors in the system (hosts and environmental injection drug equipment in the case of HCV).",

Firstly, our model highlights the differing roles of uninfected and infected injection on disease dynamics. Specifically, the model speaks to the potential utility of harm reduction policies: indiscriminately removing injection equipment from a system\u2014without an overall shift in needle populations from infected to uninfected\u2014might increase the rate of infection. In order to attenuate an epidemic, intervention strategies should focus on steering the population of needles towards being more uninfected. Therefore, ideal intervention efforts should aim to decrease sharing events on an infected needle. This helps to explain why programmes like safe injection might be effective [61]: they do not change the number of infected needles in the system directly, but can alter the sharing rate, and consequently, the probability of sharing an infected needle.",

This epidemic is typified by recreational use of prescription and illicit opioids, with injection drug use being a major route through which drugs are consumed [42]. The relevance of viral diseases among opioid users gained national attention during a 2015 outbreak of HIV in rural Indiana that was driven by an injected opioid called oxymorphone [62,63]. This outbreak raised alarms in the public health community, and officials are increasingly aware of the potential for future outbreaks. However, it was not until relatively recently that the role of the opioid crisis in HCV transmission has been examined [64,65]. We propose, in closing, that modelling approaches (in general, and not relegated to the methods proposed in this study) are crucial for understanding, attenuating or preventing explosive outbreaks of HCV in an age when a new opioid epidemic has emerged.",
