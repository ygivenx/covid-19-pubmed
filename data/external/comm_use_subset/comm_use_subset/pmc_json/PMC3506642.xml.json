            "text": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi), is the most severe and fatal form of leishmaniasis if left untreated once symptoms begin. Dogs are extremely susceptible to infection and are considered the most important domestic reservoirs of the parasites [1], [2]. Thus, canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) represents a serious public health problem in both human and veterinary medicine in various areas of the globe including regions of the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, Asia and Europe [3]. Often, the prevalence of infected dogs in endemic areas is high [4], with animals developing variable clinical signs of infection but also subclinical cases. In addition, subclinically infected dogs and symptomatic animals are important reservoirs for the infection of sandflies [5], [6]. The current control strategy to interrupt transmission includes systematic treatment of human cases, vector control and the elimination of seropositive dogs [3], [7], [8]. Recently an increase of drug resistance, toxicity of chemotherapy and difficulties in epidemiological control has been documented [9], [10], [11]. Therefore, the development of a vaccine against CVL for controlling canine disease and reducing the incidence of human VL is fundamental and urgent [7].",

In contrast, recombinant vaccines like the multicomponent Leish-111f fusion protein associated with different adjuvants (MPL-SE or AdjuPrime) showed significant immunogenic results in dogs after challenge with L. infantum\n[14] but failed to prevent natural L. infantum infection and the progression of the disease in an open kennel trial [15]. In addition, a vaccine composed of a glycoproteic complex, fucose\u2013mannose ligand, associated with saponin (Leishmune\u00ae/Fort Dodge) showed 76% to 80% vaccine efficacy in dogs in a field assay in an endemic area in Brazil [16], [17], [18]. Another vaccine licensed in Brazil, composed of the A2 recombinant protein in formulation with saponin (Leish-Tec\u00ae/Hertape Calier), was also tested in a kennel assay (Phase I and II) and presented high levels of specific antibodies with positive parasitism in the bone marrow of four of seven vaccinated dogs after 9 months post experimental challenge with L. infantum\n[19].",

Our research group has developed a vaccine against CVL composed of L. braziliensis antigens plus saponin as an adjuvant (LBSap vaccine). In previous studies the LBSap vaccine was shown to be safe for use, with no ulcerated lesions being observed at the inoculation sites [23], [28]. We also demonstrated the vaccine\u2019s immunogenicity, including an increase in immunoglobulin isotypes; higher levels of T lymphocytes, particularly circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes; intense cell proliferation; NO production during in vitro stimulation; and higher levels of Leishmania-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes after three doses in dogs [23]. Considering the promising results of the LBSap vaccine, the aim of this study was to further evaluate the immunogenicity and perform parasitological analysis after challenge by intradermal inoculum with L. infantum plus salivary gland extract (SGE) of Lutzomyia longipalpis 885 days later. We also evaluated the cellular immune response employing real-time PCR for determine the cytokines profile and parasite burdens in the spleen.",

The characteristics of this disease and the complexity related to its control are increasingly posing a significant epidemiologic problem. Many efforts are made for identify a profile of biomarkers of resistance or susceptibility in CVL. Increased levels of parameters like parasite load, IL-10 and tumour growth factor-\u03b21 expression, Leishmania-specific cell immunodepression or Leishmania-specific-IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE serum antibodies are related to clinical disease progression. By contrast, increased levels of parameters such as PBMCs proliferation after leishmanial antigen stimulation, IFN-\u03b3 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, CD4+, CD8+ and B cell subsets, or positive leishmanin skin test are related to resistance [33]. The infection in dogs is directly connected to human disease because these animals have certain peculiarities such as high susceptibility to infection, high levels of skin parasites even without clinical signs and its intrinsic connection with the human population [34]. Thus, the development of vaccines against CVL may be an important tool and an effective method to indirectly reduce the incidence of human VL [33], [35], [36], [37]. Numerous anti-CVL vaccines containing diverse antigens and adjuvants have been tested and some have shown promising results [12], [13], [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [38]. Vaccines derived from whole Leishmania antigens are still attractive for use as immunoprophylactics against CVL because they have low-cost production and reduced need for handling and processing of the final product [33], [39] and present promising results for the control of Leishmania infection [14], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].",

            "text": "In the present work we conducted a detailed analysis of the immunogenicity of LBSap vaccine in dogs during 885 days after intradermal inoculation using L. infantum and SGE of L. longipalpis. The LBSap vaccine has been shown to induce significant immunization effects, including increased Ig isotypes, higher levels of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes, intense cell proliferation, NO production during in vitro stimulation and higher levels of Leishmania-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes [23]. In this work, we observed a strong and sustained induction of humoral immune response in animals immunized with LBSap, with increased levels of total IgG anti-Leishmania and their subclasses, IgG1 and IgG2, after experimental challenge. In addition it was observed that the LBSap group has low IgG2/IgG1 ratio values. Molano et al. [40], using a recombinant vaccine associated with BCG, obtained similar results. Vaccinated/challenged dogs showed strong serum reactivity with increased production of specific IgG against L. infantum antigen. Recently, Fernandes et al. [19] demonstrated in a phase II clinical trial, increased production of total IgG and IgG2 in dogs immunized and an increase in IgG1 in non-immunized animals, suggesting that this subclass was associated with a pattern of clinical progression in CVL. On the other hand, other researchers suggest that lower levels of IgG1 are in fact more closely associated with symptomatic dogs [41], [42], [43]. Our results agree in part with those results, describing an association between high levels of IgG1 and the establishment/maintenance of asymptomatic chronic disease as observed in the low IgG2/IgG1 ratio values in the LBSap group. Our findings suggest that the LBSap vaccine promotes a mixed profile of immune responses (Th1/Th2) characteristic of vaccines composed of whole Leishmania antigens as reported in previous studies [16], [23], [24], [25], [27].",

Similar results were observed by Borja-Cabrera et al. [18] who demonstrated an increase in CD21+ B lymphocytes in a clinical trial after immunization with the Leishmune vaccine. In the natural history of the CVL, Reis et al. [44] reported that the decrease in CD21+ B cells could be related to increased parasite load in the bone marrow and the severity of clinical signs of the disease. Thus, the increase in CD21+ B lymphocytes, characteristic of the group LBSap, may be a biomarker of resistance in the CVL considering this cell as APCs. This hypothesis, however, needs further investigation.",

In the present study, we observed increased levels of CD4+ T cells (20 and 274 dac) as well as CD8+ T cells (20 and 90 dac) in the LBSap group. Ramos et al. [48] using a DNA vaccine for the LACK protein, did not observe alterations in circulating T-lymphocyte populations (CD4+ and CD8+) in vaccinated animals after intravenous challenge with L. infantum. In a Brazilian endemic area, vaccination using Leishmune\u00ae showed increased frequency of CD8+ T lymphocytes and absence of CVL clinical signs 18 months after immunization [18]. Indeed, several studies using naturally infected animals showed a correlation between increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells with resistance against infection by L. infantum\n[33], [44], [49], [50], [51]. Thus, our findings suggest that LBSap-vaccinated dogs present a cell profile that is consistent with the development of a protective immunity against L. infantum infection.",

Interestingly, we observed an increase in the numbers of CD14+ cells mainly in the LBSap group during the follow-up (20, 435 and 885 dac). Studies on the natural history of the canine disease have shown that symptomatic animals with high parasite loads in the spleen have a dramatic decrease in the circulating CD14+ monocyte counts [52]. On the basis of these results, it is possible to speculate that the observed increase of CD14+ in LBSap-vaccinated dogs could indicate that a resistance phenotype in the experimental infection with L. infantum is related to the levels of these cells, reflecting improved control of tissue parasitism in vaccinated dogs.",

Higher cell reactivity following stimulation by VSA was recorded for the LBSap group at all measured times (90, 435 and 885 dac), whereas stimulation with SLcA showed only higher cell reactivity at 435 dac in the vaccine group. Studies conducted by Lemesre et al.

Similar results were observed by Rafati et al.

Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that PBMCs from the LBSap group were able to recognize Leishmania antigen and proliferate, suggesting that the LBSap vaccine may be a useful tool against CVL.",

Following in vitro stimulation, a lower CD8+ T-lymphocyte index was associated with VSA and SLcA (435 dac) stimulus. Ara\u00fajo et al.

These studies showed that IFN-\u03b3 is a high-quality biomarker of immunogenicity and protection against Leishmania. On the other hand, increased IL-10 expression has been associated with increase in parasitic loads and progression of the disease [57], [58]. In this study, we observed increased IFN-\u03b3 expression in LB and LBSap groups in the spleen. Interestingly, we observed decreased expression of regulatory cytokines, such as IL-10 in LBSap dogs and TGF-\u03b21, in LB and LBSap groups. These findings reinforce the protection profile of LBSap vaccine. When we evaluated the IFN-\u03b3/IL-10 or IFN-\u03b3/TGF-\u03b21 ratios, we observed that only LBSap group showed higher ratios than the other groups. Overall, our results suggest that dogs vaccinated with LBSap present valuable biomarkers of immunogenicity and protection against canine leishmaniasis even after 885 days post-challenge.",

In this study we selected spleen as the target tissue for detection of the parasite because it is one of the major site for the parasites [44]. Nowadays, the real-time PCR technique has also been used by several authors in order to diagnose and screen the evolution of VL in quantifying the parasite burden presenting with high sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility [31], [57], [61]. In our work, we applied real-time PCR technique to quantify the number of amastigotes per mg of spleen and we observed that only LBSap group showed lower parasitism. Furthermore, the LBSap dogs showed higher proportion of parasite reduction (54%) compared with LB (40%) and Sap (33%) groups. Thus, the protection obtained in the present study confirms the capacity of LBSap vaccine to limit parasite replication and prevent severe disease even long term after challenge (885 days).",
