The country\u2019s disease surveillance systems have generally been passive, and managed by vertical programs. An example of this is the National Tuberculosis (TB) Program, which has conducted TB surveillance since the late 1980s.12 TB surveillance is paper based, data are collected by health-care providers, aggregated in monthly reports, and stored at the departmental level. Data validation meetings are organized on a quarterly basis with the departments and the health-care providers.13\u201316 Another example, the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) surveillance system, started in 2008,14 is facility based and receives reports from all facilities where HIV testing and counseling services are provided. Aggregated and case-based data are entered by a data clerk at the health facility onto a web-based platform for aggregate reporting, or by health-care providers through one of the three electronic medical record systems currently in use across the country.14,16 These vertical surveillance systems were created out of a necessity to collect key data in the absence of a broad, national integrated surveillance system that could provide actionable data for all priority diseases.",

Between 1988 and 1991, MSPP implemented a Sentinel Surveillance Network, mainly for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as acute flaccid paralysis, measles, neonatal tetanus, and meningococcemia, which paved the way for the expansion of the surveillance system. Initially established in the metropolitan area of the capital, Port-au-Prince, this network was later expanded to cover all departments. It was then managed by a Haitian nongovernmental organization until 1999, when funding from international donors decreased considerably. Operational management of the sentinel surveillance network was transferred to MSPP; however, decreased funding and political turmoil resulted once more in a halt in the expansion of the network.10",

From the original 51 sentinel sites in 2010,9 the surveillance system has grown to include 347 sites as of December 31, 2015 (Figure 1).

Because of the limited availability of laboratory diagnostics at health facilities, the surveillance system is primarily syndromic. The surveillance officers collect aggregated data on cases meeting the case definitions for conditions under surveillance. In 2010, there were 56 officers spread across the country collecting data on 25 conditions; by the end of 2015, there were 168 working at all levels of the national health system collecting data on 47 conditions. Surveillance officers working at health facilities collect and report data from the facility. Communal surveillance officers do the same, but for all health facilities within the commune; they also perform data validation for the commune. At the departmental health directorates, the surveillance officers oversee surveillance within the department under the supervision of a departmental epidemiologist. They also work with a deputy departmental epidemiologist, responsible for VPD surveillance, a statistician, and monitoring and evaluation officers.",

Within the country, the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system and ensure that laboratory results are linked in surveillance system with cases. Integrating laboratory confirmation into routine surveillance and its complementary systems is essential to minimize delays in taking public health action.20 The laboratory-enhanced surveillance system represents a significant step in the long-term transition toward laboratory-based surveillance and a model for how the laboratory testing can be best integrated into routine surveillance activities as capacity in this field continues to grow. However, much work remains to be done along this axis. As one example of an area for future improvement, the ongoing implementation of electronic laboratory information management systems will allow testing results to be linked with case data in real time. Furthermore, laboratory diagnostic capacity at the level of health facilities across the country needs to continue to be improved in parallel to the strengthening of regional reference laboratories. To achieve this, in parallel to building diagnostic capacity at this level, sites should be encouraged to routinely send samples to the national laboratory as a part of their quality assurance program.",

Surveillance should continue to be a focus for MSPP in the coming years to prevent the collapse of these achievements; however, without national financial investments in surveillance, uncertainty will continue to persist.",
