High dose systemic glucocorticosteroids (steroids) are currently recommended as first-line treatment for grade II-IV aGVHD resulting in overall complete responses (CR) in 40%-50% of patients [2, 3]. However, the likelihood to respond to treatment decreases with increasing severity of the disease. Patients with grade II aGVHD at diagnosis are significantly more likely to achieve a CR to initial treatment with high dose steroids as compared to patients with more advanced aGVHD [4, 5]. The prognosis of patients with aGVHD who fail to respond to high dose steroids is poor [2]. Currently there is no standard second-line treatment for steroid-refractory aGVHD (SR-aGVHD). Numerous strategies to treat SR-aGVHD have been reported, but results have been disappointing with varying response rates and long term overall survival (OS) of only 20\u201330% [2].",

Etanercept is a recombinant human tumor necrosis receptor fusion protein which binds TNF\u03b1 with high affinity and as a consequence inhibits the biological activity of TNF\u03b1. Studies that have investigated the use of anti-TNF\u03b1 as primary as well as secondary treatment in aGVHD have shown promising response rates. First-line combination with methylprednisolone yielded a CR rate of 69% [7] and second-line treatment resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% [8]. Second-line therapy combining etanercept with daclizumab showed an ORR of 67% [9]. Treatment with multi-agent combination therapy including etanercept has been reported to induce responses in 81% of patients [10]. Based on these data we implemented the use of etanercept as second-line treatment for SR-aGVHD. Here we report the results of a retrospective analysis of patients with SR-aGVHD treated with etanercept in our center.",

Steroid-refractory acute GVHD in particular is associated with a poor prognosis with a long term overall survival of only 20\u201330%. Studies evaluating second-line treatment with the anti-TFN\u03b1 agent etanercept have shown promising results with overall response rates of 50\u201380% [8\u201310]. We performed a retrospective analysis in a small cohort of patients treated with etanercept for grade III SR-aGVHD of the gut. Second-line treatment with etanercept resulted in an encouraging overall response rate of 53%. Nevertheless, eventually all treated patients died, most importantly due to progression of GVHD and opportunistic infections.",

Despite an ORR of 48%, OS was only 10% at a median of 55 days, due to progressive GVHD, serious infections and relapse of underlying disease. The pattern of a promising initial response in about 50% of patients, followed by non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients due to either progressive GVHD or the occurrence of serious infections, in particular, compares well to our findings. Wolff et al. prospectively studied the use of etanercept (16mg/m2) in combination with dacluzimab (1mg/kg), an IL-2 receptor antibody, in 21 patients with SR-aGVHD (9). This cohort was younger with a median age of 44 years, and included fewer patients with high-stage involvement of the gut.

Anti-TNF\u03b1 agents, in particular, are associated with a high incidence of opportunistic infections [15]. Moreover, the use of CB derived stem cells in four patients might have contributed, as transplantation of CB derived stem cells, in particular, is associated with delayed immune reconstitution [16].

In the present study, all but one patient received antifungal prophylaxis at the time of initiation of etanercept. Thirteen patients received voriconazole and one patient was treated with amphotericin inhalations as elevated liver enzymes impeded the use of voriconazole.
