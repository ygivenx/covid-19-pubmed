It was reported that SFTSV can be transmitted in several ways: 1) patients can be infected through a tick bite; the virus has been detected in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks [1], [7] and/or 2) through person-to-person transmission via contact with blood from patients with SFTS [8]. Sporadic and clustered SFTS endemics have been documented in at least six provinces in Northeastern, Eastern, and Central China since 2009 [1], .",

A high mortality rate (ranging from 12%\u201330%) has been reported for SFTSV-infected patients [1], [6], . The exact mechanism of SFTSV pathogenesis remains unclear but it is generally suspected that immunopathology plays a key role [10], [11]. As with other viral infections, immune activation and exaggerated cytokine production in the form of cytokine storm can potentially drive the SFTS disease process. Several studies reported that SFTSV infection could lead to elevated levels of serum cytokines, which might contribute to disease severity and clinical outcome [6], [12], [13]. In separate reports it was shown that the viral infection induced CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cell population changes [11], [14]. However, almost all of the previous reports showed data collected at one or two time points of the disease process rather than determining dynamic changes in key lab test results and immunological markers incurred during the critical clinical period shortly after infection.",

During hospitalization, all patients received similar treatment based on guidelines from the Chinese Ministry of Health [15]. Four died within 1\u20133 days after admission (7\u20139 days after onset of fever) and 29 patients recovered from the illness. The length between symptom onset to admission did not contribute to the mortality as those deceased were admitted on Day 7 of symptom onset while the median time of admission for those who survived was 6 days (range 3\u201310 days) (Table 1). There was no gender bias for the deceased (2 males/2 females) and survivors (14 males/16 females) patients. On the other hand, the median age of the deceased patients (70 years) was notably older than the median age of survivors (59 years), but not statistically significant due to a small sample size (Table 1).",

Previous studies found that total CD3+ T cells and total CD4+ T cells were decreased in SFTSV-infected patients, more so during acute phase infection, in severe cases, and in those who eventually die from the disease [11]. At the same time, there is no significant change in CD8+ T cells [11], [14]. Because the measurement of serum cytokines in SFTSV-infected patients in previous studies actually showed increased levels consistent with a cytokine storm as expected in a typical major viral infection, the above data of total T cells was surprising. In the current study, change within subpopulations of T cells was investigated and profound T cell activation was discovered.",

CTLA4 is a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells and transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells. HLA-DR and CTLA4 may serve as upregulation markers in the recovery phase and may have a role in checking and re-balancing the lymphocytes once the viral infection is under control. Taken together, our data imply that an increase inCD69+ T cells may be related to pathogenesis while a late increase in HLA-DR+ and CTLA4+ T cells may indicate the induction of protective immune responses.",

In our study, both pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10) were elevated in SFTSV-infected patients and levels were dramatically higher in the deceased patients, which is similar to reports by other groups [6], [10]. More significantly, IL-6 and IL-10 were persistently elevated in the deceased patients while levels trended down in survivors, indicating the possibility of using them as biomarkers to monitor the progression of the disease. Levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17A were similar to normal healthy donors; this finding is somewhat different from previous reports showing that TNF-\u03b1 was significantly elevated in SFTS-infected patients, especially deceased patients [6], [10].
