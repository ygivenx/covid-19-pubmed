As expected, due to the exclusive selection towards these epitopes when immunizing with BPPcysOVAMPEG, the highest number of cytokine producing T cells was observed in this group (Fig. 2A\u2013C). BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination induced increased numbers of IL-4-producing Th2 cells compared to the \u03b1DEC-205/OVA and OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG immunized groups (Fig. 2A). Compared to the vaccine formulations lacking direct antigen targeting to DCs, BPPcysOVAMPEG, and to a lesser extent \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunization, at the same time showed the strongest potential to induce IFN\u03b3-producing T cells (Fig. 2B,C). Of note, the adjuvant BPPcysMPEG alone or vaccination with non-adjuvanted immunodominant OVA peptides did not induce IFN\u03b3-producing T cells. Furthermore, peptide targeting to DCs using the BPPcyOVAMPEG formulation induced significantly more IFN\u03b3-producing T cells than vaccination of mice using peptides adjuvanted with BPPcysMPEG (Supplementary Fig. S1D\u2013G).",

Despite the fact that IFN\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells were also induced in OVA + BPPcysMPEG immunized mice (Fig. 2C) no lysis of target cells was detectable in this group (Fig. 2D). Thus, while antigen delivery to DCs by targeting DEC-205 resulted in a rather weak and balanced Th1 (IFN\u03b3) and Th2 (IL-4) cell response, it was highly effective in generating antigen-specific CTLs. Similarly, BPPcysOVAMPEG-mediated antigen targeting to TLR2/6 induced balanced Th1/Th2 T helper and robust OVA-specific CTL responses.",

While Ad-GFP-luc control infection induced only marginal hepatocellular cell death or cellular infiltrations (Fig. 4A), infection of all OVA-immunized groups with AdOVA-GFP-luc led to drastic histological lesions in the liver, hepatocellular cell death and marked infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into the tissue (Fig. 4A\u2013C). Since histological scoring revealed a trend towards an enhanced immunopathology in the liver of \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunized and AdOVA-GFP-luc infected mice compared to the BPPcysOVAMPEG group, we further elucidated whether \u03b1DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination would result in distinct immune cell recruitment following viral infection. However, automated multidimensional fluorescent microscopy (MELC) on liver sections revealed no significant differences in the hepatic composition of leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, B cells and T cell subsets among the groups (Fig. 5A,B and Supplementary Fig. S2). Altogether, the observed type of immunopathology in \u03b1DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice was indicative for acute hepatitis as a consequence of the immune-mediated clearance of virus infected hepatocytes suggesting that antigen-specific CTLs present in the liver following vaccination accounted for the hepatocyte damage.",

While we did neither observe significant differences in the number of virus infected hepatocytes, nor in the number of hepatocytes staining positive for active caspase-3 (Fig. 5C,D) or in the frequency of CD8+ T cells being in loose contact with infected hepatocytes (>22 \u03bcm distance, Fig. 5E), we indeed observed significantly fewer CD8+ T cells being in direct contact (<9 \u03bcm) to AdOVA-GFP-luc infected hepatocytes in \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunized mice compared to the BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized group (Fig. 5E). Strikingly, despite lower abundance of CD8+ T cells being in intimate contact with virus infected cells, substantially more of them were found to be closely associated with active caspase-3 and thus apoptotic cells in the liver of \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunized mice (Fig. 5E). Together with the observation that compared to BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunization resulted in the accumulation of significantly higher frequency of IFN\u03b3+CD44highCD8+ effector T cells in virus infected livers (Fig. 3C) these data may indicate that the two different DC-targeting formulations may indeed stimulate distinct types of effector functions being active during virus elimination from the liver.",

Although not reaching statistical significance compared to \u03b1DEC-205/OVA vaccination, this approach tended to promote a more robust viral clearance, as well as slightly less pronounced hepatocellular cell death and pro-inflammatory effect. The value of TLR agonist-antigen conjugates for inducing Th1 and CD8+ T cell responses are clearly underscored by our new data and previous studies3132. However, for clinical application such conjugates will need to be tailored to match different HLA alleles and rapidly mutating viruses (e.g. HCV)33. It could be possible to exploit chemical groups of BPPcysMPEG to generate conjugates with more complex antigens or to engineer universal docking systems enabling non-covalent binding, such as those used in the past for antibodies34.",

These discrepancies may be due to differences in the antigen concentration used (3 mg vs. 7 \u03bcg)12. However, we have no explanation yet why the memory T cells present in the liver of OVA + BPPcysMPEG immunized mice did not exhibit cytotoxic function. Strikingly, despite the lack of viral eradication in the OVA + BPPcysMPEG vaccinated group, these mice displayed marked immunopathology and elevated ALT levels following AdOVA-GFP-luc infection. We may speculate that, although being functionally impaired in terms of cytotoxicity, antigen-specific recognition of the virus by IFN\u03b3+CD44+CD8+ T cells results in cytokine release followed by innate immune activation and immune cell recruitment that finally result in hepatic cell death and inflammation independent of CTL mediated killing.",

            "text": "While in our hands both DC targeting approaches next to CTL responses induced a rather balanced Th1/Th2 profile, immunization with OVA + BPPcysMPEG that does not involve DC targeting failed to induce CTLs and resulted in a Th2 dominated cytokine profile (Figs 1C and 2). Interestingly, BPPcysMPEG has been shown to induce Th1-type immune responses in the context of allergens and parasite antigens363738. However, intramuscular immunization with hepatitis B surface antigen virus-like particles co-administered with BPPcysMPEG resulted in a Th2 dominated response39. Therefore, the adjuvant dose, the route of administration and the intrinsic features of the antigen may account for the observed differences in the T helper cell phenotype. While Schulze and colleagues proved BPPcysMPEG to be a potent mucosal adjuvant for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the authors focused on the cellular and humoral immune responses, but did not test for antiviral activity40. Thus, BPPcysMPEG has not been investigated before regarding its potency to induce antiviral immunity. In the absence of DC targeting, i.e. by using the OVA + BPPcysMPEG formulation, we clearly show the induction of a Th2-biased CD4+ T cell phenotype, the lack of CTLs and in consequence no antigen-specific clearance of virus infected hepatocytes. While previous studies have demonstrated the exceptional potential of DEC-205-mediated antigen targeting to elicit adaptive immunity141516171824 to our knowledge this is the first study showing the induction of liver-specific immune reactions. We demonstrate that targeting DEC-205+ DCs resulted in a high frequency of local IFN\u03b3+CD44+CD8+ memory T cells (Fig. 3C), which correlate with protection against adenovirus challenge in the liver (Fig. 6). One critical point in fighting viral infections is to keep the balance between protective immunity and immunopathology, which are both mainly driven by CTLs and often decisive for the fate of the infected host4142. For hepatotropic viruses such as HCV, which is not believed to be directly cytopathic, liver damage is attributed to T cell-mediated immunity29 and immunopathology is inevitable for sterilizing immunity. On the other hand, a less vigorous CTL response allows for viral persistence, ultimately leading to progressive tissue injury43. Only in the \u03b1DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG group could immunopathology be correlated with antigen-specific viral clearance in the liver (Fig. 6). Regarding the severity of hepatitis that occurs as a side effect of pathogen elimination, it is highly conceivable that \u03b1DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice would have recovered from liver damage. In a published model of fulminant hepatic failure, ALT levels peaked at day 4\u20135 post infection, which was the end-point of the experiments in our study, and had almost normalized by day 6 post infection44. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the consequences of immune-mediated hepatitis.",

While a number of clinical trials indicated that CpG is sufficiently well tolerated, Poly(I:C) was shown to exhibit severe side effects in humans45. Of note, its synthetic derivative, PolyICLC, which has already been successfully used in DEC-205 targeting trials464748 exhibits a better resistance to hydrolysis as well as a greater potency to induce IFN\u03b3-secreting T cells49 than Poly(I:C) and, most importantly, was proven a safe adjuvant in healthy human volunteers50 and in cancer patients5152. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether \u03b1DEC-205/OVA vaccination using PolyICLC/CpG as an adjuvant will be as efficient as (or even more efficient than) \u03b1DEC-205/OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG vaccination in inducing antiviral immunity in the liver. Regarding the TLR2/6 agonist BPPcysMPEG which is known to activate cross-priming CD8\u03b1+ DCs in mice, so far no published data are available for clinical applications. It has recently been shown that human CD141+ DCs which are thought to represent the functional equivalent of mouse CD8\u03b1+ DCs do express TLR2 and 653. Thus, an interaction of BPPcysOVAMPEG with DCs via the TLR2/6 receptors is likely to take place also in humans. Nevertheless, future in vitro studies are needed to clarify this issue in more detail.",

            "text": "We observed distinct patterns of CD8+ T cell interaction with virus infected and apoptotic hepatocytes, dependent on the vaccine formulation we used (Fig. 5C\u2013E). While significantly fewer CD8+ T cells were in intimate contact with virus infected hepatocytes in the \u03b1DEC-205/OVA-immunized group, these CD8+ T cells appear to be more effective in inducing apoptosis which is in line with the higher expression of IFN\u03b3 as a marker for their cytotoxic potential. It is well established that CTLs eliminate infected hepatocytes after direct antigen recognition on target cells via perforin/granzyme or Fas-mediated killing. However, cytotoxicity in virus infected hepatocytes can also be exerted via the non-canonical CTL effector function where CTLs are stimulated by cross-presenting liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and secrete TNF after stimulation54. TNF induces cell death specifically in infected hepatocytes involving caspase-3 activation following TNFR stimulation. Of note, well in line with the observed elevated frequencies of IFN\u03b3+CD44+CD8+ CTL in AdOVA-GFP-luc infected livers of \u03b1DEC-205/OVA compared to BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice, the overall IFN\u03b3 and as well TNF expression levels were by far higher in the \u03b1DEC-205/OVA treated group (Supplementary Fig. S3). IFN\u03b3 secreted by highly abundant IFN\u03b3+CD44+CD8+ CTL may account for elevated TNF expression in hepatic macrophages in AdOVA-GFP-luc infected \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunized mice. Alternatively, as shown before by Wohlleber et al.54, virus-specific CTLs induced during \u03b1DEC-205/OVA may be the source of TNF. While further investigation is needed to decipher the specific mechanisms underlying the elimination of virus infected hepatocytes in \u03b1DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccinated mice, we may speculate that immune surveillance in \u03b1DEC-205/OVA immunized mice in addition to cell-contact dependent CTL-mediated killing to a higher degree involves cytokine-mediated effector functions. At first line TNF may be the most important cytokine involved in elimination of virus infected hepatocytes as it can induce apoptosis in adenovirus infected hepatocytes. Although IFN\u03b3 has been shown to exert non-cytolytic antiviral effector function in HBV infected hepatocytes55, previous reports have shown that IFN\u03b3 ko mice behave exactly the same as wildtype mice with regards to antiviral immune response against adenovirus infected hepatocytes and following liver damage2854. This does not exclude that high levels of IFN\u03b3 may enhance secondary antiviral effects for example by the upregulation of antigen-presentation by hepatocytes enhancing recognition of infected cells by CTLs.",

            "text": "The induction of antiviral immunity in the liver is per se a challenging issue. A hallmark of e.g. HCV persistence is the appearance of functionally impaired and exhausted T cells that are unable to secrete antiviral effector molecules, show impaired proliferation295657 and dysregulate expression of activating/inhibitory receptors585960. Next to this, in patients chronically infected with HCV the higher frequency of suppressive CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells61 most likely contribute to T cell dysfunction. Since blocking of PD-1, CTLA-4 and Tim-3 hold some therapeutic promise for the functional recovery of exhausted T cells596062, a combined strategy encompassing both antibody-mediated blocking of immunosuppressive pathways together with boosting antiviral immunity by means of DEC-205- or TLR-mediated antigen delivery to cross-presenting DCs could represent a promising scenario for future developments. This may also imply the use of DC targeting as a therapeutic vaccine, which has been shown to be clearly effective in several other studies142125, and might also contribute to the treatment of patients with hepatic virus infection after liver transplantation to avoid reinfection.",
