A standardized application form and a template for the ethical review of research proposals in emergency situations therefore needed to be developed, as well as models for collaboration between various research ethics committees in epidemic situations, especially when multi\u2010centre studies are proposed. This could possibly expedite the conducting of research in public health emergencies, and facilitate the rapid sharing of research outcome data that could be highly beneficial not only to local communities, but also to the global community.",
