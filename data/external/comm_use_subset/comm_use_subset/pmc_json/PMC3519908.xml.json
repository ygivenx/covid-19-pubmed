            "text": "Microencapsulation of vaccine agents and drugs in biodegradable polymer and its delivery in humans is an innovative approach to create more robust medications and vaccines in the 21st century. The biocompatible and biodegradable polymer, PLGA [poly (lactide-co-glycolides)], is the US FDA approved material in the development of nanoparticle-based controlled release delivery system [1]. PLGA slowly degrades and releases the vaccine over a long-period of time, thus avoiding the need of a booster dose [2]. Being particulate in nature, the nanoparticle-mediated delivery promotes uptake of Ags by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs). Nanoparticle as a delivery vehicle to vaccines and drugs has been extensively evaluated in mouse models. However, there are limitations in the translation of novel rodent findings to improve human and food animal health [3]. Therefore, pig may serve as a useful large animal model for such research. Moreover, due to their physiological, anatomical, and immunological similarity to humans, pigs are already in use as an animal model system to study a few viral diseases [4]. Although, the current study is focused on a respiratory pathogen which infects pigs, and the vaccine evaluation strategy may help to consider pig as a model system.",

This translates into $1.8 million losses per day annually. PRRSV infects pigs of all ages and is caused by a highly mutating, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus belongs to the family Arteriviridae\n[6]. PRRS in growing pigs causes anorexia, fever, respiratory distress, and enhanced susceptibility to secondary microbial infections; while in pregnant sows it is characterized by reproductive dysfunction and abortions [7]. Primary PRRSV permissive cells are alveolar macrophages (M\u03c6s) [8]. PRRSV rapidly modulates the host innate immune response, such as dampens the NK cell cytotoxicity and reduces the IFN-\u03b1 production, and upregulates immunosuppressive mediators from as early as two days post-infection [9]; which lead to poor adaptive immune response and delayed/weak virus neutralizing antibody response, resulting in PRRSV persistence. Nevertheless, due to high degree of constant genetic and antigenic variations, control of PRRS remains a challenge to the swine industry worldwide.",

Generation of protective IgA response is essential to reduce and/or prevent the entry of pathogens whose principle port of entry is through mucosal sites [11]. Mucosal immunization induces effective immune response at both local and distant effector sites. Particulate antigen delivery system facilitates the passage of Ags through mucosal barrier and leads to stimulation of the underlying mucosal immune cells [12]. Biodegradable microspheres made of Chitosan, PLGA, and liposome have been in use to deliver candidate vaccines to mucosal sites [13]. A study using nanoparticle-entrapped killed influenza virus vaccine administered with an adjuvant intranasally to mice, rabbits, and pigs elicited protective immune response, with better immunity induced in pigs by intranasal compared to intramuscular route of vaccination [14]. A single intranasal delivery of PLGA nanoparticle-entrapped Schistosoma mansoni Ags to mice elicited protective neutralizing antibody response in the lungs and blood [15].",

Like the field virus, PRRS-MLV also induces immunosuppression [17], [18]. Moreover, there are reports of reversion of vaccine virus into virulence leading to severe disease outbreaks [19], [20]. Although available killed PRRSV vaccines are safe, they are poorly immunogenic [21]. Thus, to control PRRS outbreaks innovative vaccine strategies are required. In the current study, killed PRRSV Ags were encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles and characterized the candidate vaccine in vitro and in a pre- and -post-challenge study in pigs. Various immune correlates of protection were analyzed both at mucosal and systemic sites to show the evidences of cross-protective immunity.",

In the serum samples of Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs increased IgA antibody levels at PC 0 (samples collected on the same day as viral challenge but before inoculating the challenge virus) with a significant increase at PC 15 compared to either unvaccinated or K-Ag vaccinated, MN184 challenged pigs was detected (Figure 4, D). The PRRSV specific IgG antibody levels in serum (Figure 4, E) and both IgA and IgG levels in the nasal swab (Figure 4, G & H) were significantly higher in Nano-KAg vaccinated, compared to unvaccinated and K-Ag immunized pigs at DPC 15. Significantly increased PRRSV specific neutralizing antibody (VN) titers in serum of both K-Ag and Nano-KAg vaccine received pig groups was observed at PC 7, which still remained high (although not significant) only in the Nano-KAg group at PC 15. In the lungs, a similar trend of increased (but not significant) titers of neutralizing antibodies in Nano-KAg immunized pigs was seen (Figure 4, C & F).",

Suggesting that in Nano-KAg vaccinated virulent heterologous PRRS challenged pigs, these effectors played a pivotal role in the viral clearance.

Nanoparticles protect the entrapped proteins from protease-mediated degradation at mucosal surfaces, and also aid in slow sustained release of the vaccine [36]. PLGA nanoparticle induces activation and maturation of human DCs by upregulating the expression of costimulatory and MHC class II molecules, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and enhances the APCs allostimulatory property [37], [38]. Consistent with the inherent adjuvant property of PLGA, pig APCs treated with PLGA nanoparticle vaccine (Nano-KAg) had increased expression of a costimulatory molecule, CD80/86. In our study, we did not include a pig group with empty PGLA nanoparticles, as our primary goal was to augment the killed PRRSV vaccine induced anti-PRRSV cross-protective immunity with the help of PLGA, a well-known adjuvant and a delivery system to vaccines. Thus, at present we do not have the information on how much of post-vaccination T cell immunity detected in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs was due to the adjuvant effect of the PGLA nanoparticles alone, which will be considered during our future investigations. However, a rapid uptake of Nano-KAg by lung APCs followed by translocation of viral Ags into endosomal compartment was observed. Suggesting that virus specific adaptive immune response could be elicited in the respiratory tract of pigs using PLGA nanoparticle-based killed PRRSV vaccine. Differential cell counts from BAL fluid harvested from healthy mice, humans, and pigs have indicated that greater than 90% of cells are alveolar M\u03c6s [39], [40], suggesting that intranasally delivered Nano-KAg were phagocytosed by M\u03c6s.",

In contrast, in Nano-KAg immunized pig lungs, TBLN, and blood significantly reduced Tregs frequency, associated with decreased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and increased IFN-\u03b3 secretion, compared to unvaccinated and K-Ag vaccinated virus challenged pigs was observed. In a pre-challenge study, at two-week post-vaccination increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in Nano-KAg vaccinated pigs appears to be involved in initiation of adaptive immune response. Diminished production of IL-6 in post-challenged pigs at six-week post-vaccination was associated with reduced inflammatory lung pathology.",

Although, these PRRSV specific antibodies did not significantly increase the neutralizing titers in the lungs, there was complete clearance of viremia at PC 15, which was associated with various other adaptive immune correlates. Whereas in the lungs, the reduced viral titer was not significant, but a significant reduction of PRRSV antigen by immunohistochemistry and reduced lung pathology implicates the presence of active anti-PRRSV mucosal immune response elicited by Nano-KAg vaccine in the lungs (Fig 3 & 4).",

Further, in yet another Nano-KAg vaccine study we inoculated a booster dose of the vaccine and co-administered with a potent mucosal adjuvant, intranasally, showed the complete clearance of the replicating heterologous PRRSV from the lungs and clearance of viremia earlier than the current study (Binjawadagi et al., manuscript submitted). In conclusion, our study has suggested that innovative strategy of intranasal delivery of PRRSV Nano-KAg vaccine has the potential to control PRRS outbreaks, and it has the potential to reduce economic losses to swine producers. Considering pig a useful large animal model, our study may serve as a useful impetus to undertake intranasal PLGA nanoparticle-based vaccine trials against human respiratory viral infections.",
