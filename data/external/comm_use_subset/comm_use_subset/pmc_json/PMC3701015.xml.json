Heredity, environmental agent, immunity, and skin barrier function participate in the pathogenesis of AD. AD symptoms are triggered by various non-specific or specific allergic reactions. The cytokine pattern of AD, especially in the acute phase skin lesion is Th2-type cytokine dominant [1]. The barrier disrupted skin in AD is easily permitted the percutaneous entry of environmental allergens that strongly promotes Th2 immunological responses [2]. Th2 cells as well as T regulatory cell (Treg) subsets play key roles in development of AD. Patients with AD have significantly increased numbers of peripheral blood Treg compared with healthy controls, which is correlated with disease activity in AD [3], [4]. This suggests involvement of some self regulation system in immune responses in AD [5].",

The genome of hPIV2 encodes 7 mRNAs [12]\u2013[14] and has about 60-nt leader sequence at 3\u2032 end and about 20-nt noncoding trailer sequence. The gene order is 3\u2032 (leader)-NP-V/P-M-F-HN-L-(trailer)-5\u2032. The coding proteins are the nucleocapsid (NP), the V (V) and phospho (P), the matrix (M), the fusion (F), the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and the polymerase protein (L). The genomic RNA of the virus: viral RNA (vRNA) is encapsidated with the NP proteins, and the nucleocapsids are associated with the P and L proteins to form the ribonucleoprotein complex. In paramyxovirus particles, vRNA is enclosed by the viral envelope composed of a cellular lipid bilayer and two envelope glycoproteins, HN and F, which are integral transmembrane proteins mediating virus attachment and cell fusion, respectively [15]. M protein underlies the lipid bilayer to ensure the structural integrity of the viral particles and is essential for interactions between the viral envelope and the RNP complex [15]. This association leads to the budding and release of viral particles from the cell surface [15].",

In brief, to generate replication-deficient rhPIV2 vector, two nucleotides change [ATG to TAG (position of 89aa) and AAG to TAG (259aa)] were introduced into the M frame of the plasmid pPIV2, a full-length cDNA copy of hPIV2 anti-genome [19] (Fig. 1A). Consequently, the 6 n length cDNA of Ag85B or EGFP, followed by transcriptional end sequence of NP gene (R2), intergenic sequence (IG), and transcriptional start signal of V/P gene (R1) ([20] was synthesized by PCR using appropriate primers), was inserted into a Not I site of the plasmid DNA encoding the replication-deficient rhPIV2 genome described above. Then, the viruses (rhPIV2/Ag85B and rhPIV2/EGFP) were recovered by co-transfection of each anti-genomic plasmid and plasmids expressing the NP, P, M and L, each cloned in a mammalian gene expression vector (pCAGGS) [21] into BSR7/5 cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase [22]. The cells were harvested, and then co-cultured with fresh Vero cells every 48 hr. Approximately 90% of the cells showed syncytia formation in the 10th co-cultured cells, and its state was maintained in further co-culture. Furthermore, for virus propagation, Cos7 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing M and co-cultured with above-mentioned 10th cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 9,000 g for 12 h at 4\u00b0C. The virus pellet was suspended in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carisbad, CA, USA). The virus titers were determined by CPE method using Vero cells, and were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50).",

AD, especially in its acute phase, is a disease that Th2 cells are dominantly involved in the pathogenesis. In fact PBMCs from patients with AD have increased production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 with limited capacity in production of IFN-\u03b3 [23]\u2013[25]. Repeated elicitation of OX on mice ear shifts the cutaneous Th1 cytokine milieu to Th2, which represents the characteristic immunological features of AD. Immunotherapy for AD has some different options to correct the imbalance of the shifted cytokine profile. In the present study, we investigated effects of vaccination using replication-deficient rhPIV2 vector expressing Ag85B gene to mouse AD model. BCG is known as a strong Th1 response modifier; however, it has a risk for granuloma formation. To avoid granuloma formation, non-wax protein antigen is required. Ag85B is a conserved protein in mycobacterial species and can elicit a strong Th1-type immune response [8]. Therefore, Ag85B has been used as immune-modulator to control acute AD lesions or asthma. Ag85B DNA vaccine suppressed airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma [26]. Furthermore, resent studies suggested that Ag85B vaccination promotes Th1-type immune responses as well as Treg responses. Administration of Ag85B showed therapeutic effects to Th2-type cytokine mediated acute phase AD models by inducing regulatory T cells [10].",

            "text": "Selection of the vector and its application pathway has importance in successful DNA vaccination therapy. We selected hPIV2 as a potential vector for Ag85B vaccination. hPIVs are human respiratory pathogens, and the most distinctive clinical feature of infection of hPIVs is croup (i.e., laryngotracheobronchitis or swelling around the vocal chords and other parts of the upper and middle airway). Among hPIVs, hPIV1 and hPIV3 are the major cause of croup in children, whereas hPIV2 is rarely identified as a clinical pathogen. Therefore, hPIV2 has been suspected as less virulent and cytotoxic virus. hPIV2 enters the cell by cell fusion at the plasma membrane, and replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, and buds at the plasma membrane. Therefore, hPIV2 has no risk for integration in the host genome, not like retrovirus. In addition, since hPIV2 has a non-segmented and negative-stranded RNA genome, there is no antigenic shift among RNA segments, not like influenza viruses. Using technology of advanced reverse genetics [20], we constituted replication-deficient hPIV2 vector with additional advantage as a highly safe virus vector. To confirm the target and effective infection of rhPIV2 vector, we inoculated rhPIV2/EGFP to HaCat cells. HaCat cells successfully expressed EGFP up to 7 days post-infection (pi). Also, BALB/c mice intranasally single-administrated with rhPIV2/EGFP showed intense EGFP expression in the airway epithelial cells. These results strongly support activities of long-term high-level expression of the exogenous gene and efficiency of rhPIV2 in vivo.",

Inflammatory cell infiltration including mast cells and eosinophils in the lesional skin was also suppressed. In the cytokine profile, mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the ear skins was significantly increased. Interestingly, IL-4 mRNA was significantly reduced in intranasal rhPIV2/Ag85B treated groups. In IL-4 suppression and IFN-\u03b3 induction, intra-nasal application showed stronger effects compared with subcutaneous application. hPIV2 is a virus infectious to the respiratory tract mucosa, and therefore more effective capture of rhPIV2/Ag85B by respiratory epithelium compared with that of skin resident cells is reasonable. In addition, the skin derived anti-infectious molecule, horny layer proteases and epithelial skin barrier might decrease efficiency of rhPIV2.",

In fact in the current experiment, the numbers of skin infiltrating CD4+ T cells are decreased in the nasal application and ear skin application groups accompanied with increased FoxP3+ Treg population. A heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae (M. vaccae) gives rise to allergen specific regulatory T cells that produce IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, which confer the protection against airway inflammation [27]. Recently TGF-\u03b2 was proved to suppress GATA-3 function through Sox4 signal, and TGF-\u03b2 controls Th2 cell-mediated inflammation [28]. In addition, it is crucial that PIV2 itself has some effects in induction of Treg without obvious effects in clinical manifestation and Th1/Th2 balance.",
