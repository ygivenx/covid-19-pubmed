HSV1 was inoculated intranasally to the mice that already developed BLM\u2010induced lung fibrosis. One week after the HSV1 infection, the mice showed obvious diffuse lung injury, higher ALI score than mice with stable BLM\u2010induced lung fibrosis, exacerbated lung oedema, increased protein contents in the alveolar cavity, diminished lung function and reduced survival. These HSV1 infection\u2010induced histological and functional exacerbations in mice with BLM\u2010IPF resemble the clinical presentations of patients with AE\u2010IPF, such as diffuse lung injury, diminished lung function and reduced survival rate, supporting that BLM+HSV1 treatment can mimic AE\u2010IPF development closely. Previous studies have shown that nasal inoculation of \u03b3HV68 virus in addition to lung fibrosis results in lung infection\u2010stimulated exacerbation of the lung fibrosis.7, 8 Notably, because \u03b3HV68 is a mammalian virus that infects animals but not humans, \u03b3HV68 infection in addition to lung fibrosis may not mimic the AE\u2010IPF development in human. A previous study administered lipopolysaccharides (LPS) intratracheally to mice 7 days after BLM\u2010induced lung fibrosis to mimic postoperative acute exacerbation in patients with interstitial lung disease.18 However, operation\u2010induced AE\u2010IPF occurs rarely in patients. In the current study, to establish AE\u2010IPF mouse model, we used HSV1 virus, which can infect humans easily, to infect mice that already developed stable BLM\u2010IPF. Our mouse model of AE\u2010IPF can better mimic the AE\u2010IPF development in patients.",

            "text": "Acute pulmonary inflammation is closely correlated with IL\u201017A.19 IL\u201017A, a pro\u2010inflammatory factor, is secreted predominantly by TH17 cells. IL\u201017A in lung tissues enhances inflammatory responses by promoting inflammatory monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis so to clear pathogens effectively.20 However, excessive inflammatory responses may damage tissue.21 Both neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are involved in pathogen elimination and can cause acute lung inflammation in an IL\u201017\u2010dependent manner.20 In the current study, the data indicates that IL\u201017A may not play an important role in driving lung fibrosis at day 28 in mice in response to bleomycin treatment (Figure 1E). This data seems to be in contradiction to the work by Wilson et al22 that shows IL\u201017A knockout mice are refractory to bleomycin\u2010induced lung fibrosis. This might be explained by the demonstrated fact that the formation of obvious lung fibrosis appears between 14 and 28 days after a single\u2010dose administration of bleomycin in mice,23 however, Wilson and colleagues drew the conclusion by evaluating fibrosis in 7 days after administrating BLM and this has been proved to be an acute inflammatory period. In contrast, we observed the similar degree of fibrosis and hydroxyproline content in WT+BLM+Saline and IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010+BLM+Saline groups in 28 days after administration of BLM. These suggested that IL\u201017A might contribute to acute lung injury but not fibrosis in our study. Sandra et al24 showed similar conclusion in their previous study. They found that in experimental silicosis the acute alveolitis induced by silica is IL\u201017A dependent, but this cytokine appears dispensable for the development of the late fibrotic lung responses to silica. Compared with the mice treated with BLM+Saline, the BALF of mice treated with BLM+HSV1 contained higher levels of IL\u20106 and IL\u201023, which may promote pathogenic IL\u201017A+ T cell maturation25 and may ultimately increase the proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood. As far as we know, some innate immune cells such as \u03b3\u03b4T and ILC3 cells can also produce IL\u201017A in the innate primary immune responses.24 In our preliminary study, we found that patients with AE\u2010IPF had higher TH17 levels in peripheral blood than patients with stable\u2010IPF (data not shown). Thus, in the current study, we focused on the roles of Th17 cells in the AE\u2010IPF model. In our current study, we cannot exclude the effects of IL\u201017A produced by other cells such as \u03b3\u03b4T and ILC3 cells, because compared to WT mice, IL1\u20107A\u2010/\u2010 mice might have different levels of IL\u201017A\u2010producing \u03b3\u03b4T cells and ILC3 cells.",

Compared with the WT mice, the IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010 mice showed reduced G\u2010CSF and KC concentrations in the BALF, fewer inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in the BALF, attenuated lung inflammation and dysfunction and higher survival rate. Although IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010+BLM+HSV1 mice showed significantly higher ALI score than the IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010+BLM+Saline mice, the total protein in BALF of the two groups did not show significant differences. IL\u201017A knockout leads to a reduction in the number of infiltrated inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in BALF. Fewer inflammatory monocytes & neutrophils in the BALF of IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010+BLM+HSV1 group could result in milder HSV1 infection\u2010induced alveolar epithelial injury and thus less plasma protein exudation. On the other hand, total protein in BALF is just one of the indexes to evaluate ALI. As reported by Mikawa et al,13 ALI score mainly emphasizes the levels of inflammatory cell infiltration. IL\u201017A knockout obviously reduced the number of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in BALF (Figure 3I). However, inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils only accounted for a small proportion of inflammatory cells (0.167%) in the BALF of IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010+BLM+HSV1 mice. Other inflammatory cells might contribute to a higher ALI score. Nevertheless, IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010+BLM+HSV1 mice showed significantly lower ALI score than the WT+BLM+HSV1 mice (Figure 1C). Thus, IL\u201017A knockout appears to partially relieve the HSV1 infection\u2010induced acute lung injury in BLM+HSV1 mice. Our results showed that IL\u201017A knockout might not influence the clearance of HSV virus (Figure S6A,B). Bagri and colleges also reported that HSV viral titres in IL\u201017A\u2010/\u2010 mice were not significantly different from that of WT mice during genital HSV infection.28 However, neither our results nor Bagri's work were actual measurements from the lung. More work should be done to investigate the effects of IL\u201017A on the clearance of HSV by detecting the actual viral titres from lung by standard methods such as plaque assay or qRT\u2010PCR in the future. Above all, we hypothesize that IL\u201017A could be the key mediator in the HSV1 infection\u2010induced excessive acute inflammation in fibrotic lung.",

            "text": "In ERS response, protein folding is disrupted, which leads to the accumulation of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the consequent development of unfolded protein response (UPR) in the ER.29 Moderate or normal UPR can reduce the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and restore the normal physiological function of ER. However, excessive UPR may trigger inflammatory responses.30 A previous study has found the concurrence of herpes virus infection and UPR in the alveolar epithelial cells of patients with IPF, suggesting that virus infection may contribute to alveolar epithelial injury by exacerbating ERS.15 The current study found that compared with the mice treated with BLM+Saline, the mice treated with BLM+HSV1 demonstrated significantly elevated expression of UPR\u2010related proteins and particularly higher CHOP expression in lung tissue. The three signalling pathways involved in UPR: PERK, IRE\u20101, and ATF6, can all induce CHOP overexpression.31 In our study, ATF4 and ATF6 overexpression was quite obvious in the mice treated with BLM+HSV1. Jane and colleagues have found that CHOP can act as a transcription factor to co\u2010ordinate NF\u2010\u03baB to stimulate IL\u201023p19 expression synergistically.32 Our previous study has demonstrated that ERS occurs in AEC. In our previous study, we used alveolar epithelial cells (A549) to establish AE\u2010IPF cell model, and found that HSV1 infection stimulated the ER stress pathways in AEC in a time\u2010 and dose\u2010dependent manner.11 In the current study, the mice treated with BLM+HSV1 had increased IL\u201023 levels in the BALF compared with the mice treated with BLM+Saline. IL\u201023 binds to the IL\u201023 receptor on na\u00efve CD4+T cells to induce the CD4+ T cells to differentiate into TH17 cells, consequently increasing IL\u201017A concentration.33, 34 In addition, we found when ERS was inhibited by TUDCA, the proportion of Th17 cells in mouse peripheral blood was reduced; IL17A concentration in BALF was decreased; acute lung injury was also attenuated. Our findings indicate that inhibition of ERS can alleviate lung inflammation, and it probably takes effects by reducing IL\u201017A production. However, a previous study on respiratory syncytial virus infection in animal models suggests that ERS in lung tissue increases IRE\u20101expression, resulting in caspase\u20101 cleavage and mature IL\u20101\u03b2 production. This enhanced IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion might account for the aggravation of inflammation.35 While in a report on LPS\u2010induced acute lung injury, ERS can activate NF\u2010\u03baB,36 then it can promote kinds of cytokines\u2019 secretion, such as IL\u20106, IL\u201023, IL\u201017A, KC and G\u2010CSF. Till now there has not been a study identifying which pathway plays a critical role, more work should be done to explore the relationship between ER stress and inflammation. In addition, the study also suggests that anti\u2010IL\u201017A antibody treatment and IL\u201017A gene knockout alleviate UPR in lung tissue substantially, supporting that IL\u201017A may promote ERS in lung tissue36 (Figure 7).",

            "text": "Figure 7: Cartoon diagram showing the hypothesis that IL\u201017A and ERS contribute to HSV1 infection\u2010induced AE\u2010IPF. We concluded three possible mechanisms in this model. In mouse lung tissue, BLM\u2010mediated lung fibrosis stimulates ERS. (1) In addition to the existing ERS, HSV1 infection further exacerbates ERS and increases CHOP expression. CHOP, as a transcription factor, elevates the secretion of inflammatory factors, such as IL\u2010 23. IL\u201023 then promotes IL\u201017A release. IL\u201017A can enhance ERS by a positive feedback mechanism so to induce acute inflammatory reactions and acute lung damages. (2) Exacerbated ERS might increase IRE\u20101 expression, resulting in caspase\u20101 cleavage and mature IL\u20101\u03b2 production. This enhanced IL\u20101\u03b2 secretion stimulates further IL\u201017A production from CD4+ effector T cells through IL\u20101 receptor signalling. (3) ER stress increases cytokine secretion (IL\u20106, IL\u201017A, IL\u201023, KC and G\u2010CSF) by activating NF\u2010\u03baB. These cytokines contribute to HSV1\u2010induced acute inflammation in fibrotic lung",
