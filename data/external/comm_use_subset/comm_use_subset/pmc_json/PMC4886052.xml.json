For a long time, p-PD has been used in textile, leather, and hair dye industries [6]. p-PD in the hair dyes is reported to purely serve as an external dyeing agent [5]. Sporadic side effects in human and in mouse model of p-PD are reported [7\u201310]. Moreover, the experimental designs for some of those reports are not correlative with the real-life use [11\u201313]. Effects of p-PD on skin and keratinocytes have been thoroughly investigated by Bl\u00f6meke and her group [14\u201316]. p-PD is converted to Brandrowski's base by autoxidation and self-conjugation. Besides this, it is shown that keratinocytes do contain N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) which modifies p-PD by mono- and di-N-acetylation, thereby modulating its toxicity [14\u201316]. The effect of p-PD was investigated in different cell types and was found to cause apoptosis via ROS [17\u201319]. However, very little is done to demonstrate the consequence of p-PD treatment on melanocytes or melanoma cells.",

In a parallel experiment, MTT assay was done to accurately determine the number of viable cells (absorbance) among cells grown for 24 hours. This value was subtracted from the values obtained from all MTT assays using caspase inhibitors. These corrected values for sets without or with inhibitors were computed using the following equation:(1)% change in viable cell=O48I or P\u2212O24\u00d7100O24,where O48\nI  or  P is the absorbance at 48 hours; \u201cI\u201d stands for p-PD treated cells pretreated with caspase inhibitor and \u201cP\u201d stands for cells treated with only p-PD. O24 indicates the absorbance after 24 hours of cell seeding. The corrected values for % change in viable cell thus obtained were plotted against respective concentrations of p-PD.

Before that, to assess systemic cytotoxicity of p-PD in mice, two groups of Swiss-Albino mice (male, 3 weeks old) were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with p-PD (5 and 10 mg/kg) at an interval of 3 days throughout a period of 6 weeks. After the treatment, the mice appeared to be quite active as the untreated ones (data not shown). Therefore, month-long peritoneal administration of as high as 10 mg/kg of p-PD did not show any sign of toxicity in Swiss-Albino mice. After this, to explore the cytotoxic effect of p-PD on melanoma tumour, we have subcutaneously (s.c.) injected B16-F10 cells (106 cells/50 \u03bcL) into the right flank of Swiss-Albino mice for tumour generation. Two weeks later, when the tumours were visible, i.p. injections of 2 and 4 mg/kg of p-PD were given to mice bearing tumours. Our results show that this p-PD treatment to the mice carrying melanoma tumours resulted in reduction of tumour mass as revealed from the tumour size (Figure 2(a); (C) and (D)) and the corresponding decrease in body weight (Figure 2(b)). Cells derived from those p-PD treated tumours showed increased apoptosis as evident from the Annexin V based flow cytometric analysis (data not shown).",

These studies from which the side effects of p-PD were reported are mostly based on unrealistic designs such as feeding [9], topical application [26], and subcutaneous injections [13] of high dosage of p-PD. Besides these, a meagre percentage of the human population is reported to be allergic to p-PD at a concentration of 1% or above [27, 28]. 0.3% p-PD in petrolatum was reported to be reliable with respect to contact dermatitis [26]. Moreover, the concentration range of several standard anticancer drugs which are administered intravenously lies between 1 and 100 mM (FDA approved drugs for oncology) [29]. Maximum concentration of p-PD that we have used is 0.01%, equivalent to a little less than 1 mM. Therefore, according to these published reports, the concentrations of p-PD that we have used are presumed to be very safe and effective in reducing melanoma tumour mass in mice. To further verify this, we have performed haematological and serum biochemical parameters measurement of the treated mice along with the control (up to 6 weeks). Study revealed that there are no mortality and toxic symptoms with no biochemical changes in the major organs of the test groups treated with higher selected dose (10 mg/kg p-PD). No significant differences were found in body weight gain/loss, weight of major organs, and haematological and biochemical parameters of the control and test groups as shown in Tables 1 and 2.",

Treatment with higher concentrations of p-PD was unable to show any such S phase arrest. The reason for this pattern is not clear at this moment. To verify the arrest in the S phase, BrdU incorporation experiment was done using flow cytometry. The data also confirmed the block at S phase in A375 cells treated with low concentration of p-PD (Figure 4(b)). A similar pattern was also found in case of B16-F10 cells (data not shown).",

To delineate the possibilities, we have used the same cell lysates that were prepared to show the activation of PARP (as in Figure 3) to check the presence of the active forms of these caspases using immunoblot. Interestingly, in the shorter time points (6 and 24 hours), only caspase 8 gets activated (Figure 5(a), lanes 3, 4, and 6\u20138). Activation of caspase 9 is only seen in the samples treated for 48 hours (Figure 5(b), lanes 2\u20134). It is known that activated caspase 8 may lead to activation of Bid, a Bcl-2 family protein which in turn destabilizes mitochondrial membrane to initiate caspase 9 mediated intrinsic pathways [35]. To explore this possibility, we have checked the decrease of full-length Bid in the cell lysates using western blot with anti-Bid antibody. At 6 and 24 hours' time points, the amount of Bid remained unaltered (Figure 5(a), lanes 1\u20138), but its gradual decrease is observed in samples treated with increasing concentration of p-PD for 48 hours (Figure 5(b), lanes 1\u20134). It is apparent from these results that the extrinsic pathway is activated before the intrinsic one in p-PD treated melanoma cells.",

The result clearly demonstrated that cells pretreated with caspase 8 inhibitor showed significant increase in viable cell (\u2021, Figure 6) or decrease in dead cell numbers (\u25b2, Figure 6) upon p-PD treatment as compared to cells without the inhibitor (Figure 6).

However, suppression of ROS by NAC showed marked reduction in p-PD mediated apoptotic death in vitro (Table 5). This observation in conjunction with the fact that the loss of MMP occurred much earlier than the induction of ROS clearly indicates that the mitochondria are one of the primary targets of p-PD (see text). The activation of caspase 8 which took place after the initiation of loss in MMP but before the generation of ROS suggests that mitochondria possibly have a role in its activation as shown elsewhere [40]. It seems that the activation of caspase 8 and the stimulation of ROS take place via two independent pathways that may subsequently have positive feedback on each other. Indeed, there are reports that showed similar interactions between ROS and activation of caspase 8 [41, 42]. Although disruption of MMP occurred very early in response to lower concentration of p-PD, the activation of caspase 9 was only observed in cells treated with higher concentration of p-PD for 24 hours. This can be explained by citing examples of previous reports which state that loss in MMP especially by small reducing substrates does not necessarily lead to the release of cytochrome C [43, 44]. In our case, p-PD being a cell permeable reducing agent may have caused the disruption of MMP without any appreciable release of cytochrome C as evident from no activation of caspase 9 at the same time.",

            "text": "Skin cancer is the most dreadful malignant tumour by virtue of its strong resistance to known chemotherapy. The incidence of skin cancer is on the rise especially among the Caucasian population [2, 3]. Case fatality for melanoma is probably the highest, not only among skin cancers but also among all types of cancers [45, 46]. At present, high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) and more recently anti-CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4) that works through activation of the immune system are the only therapies resulting in long-term disease-free intervals [47]. Despite decades of systematic therapeutic investigations using cytotoxic, immunologic, and now molecularly targeted agents, the survival rate among treated patients with advanced melanoma is very discouraging [48]. Our study shows for the first time that both human and mouse melanoma cells undergo ROS mediated apoptotic death when treated with p-PD but not with o-PD in vitro. Most importantly, peritoneal injection of 2 and 4 mg/kg of p-PD inhibited the growth rate of B16-F10 induced melanoma tumour in mice (Figure 2). However, month-long peritoneal administration of as high as 100 mg/kg of p-PD did not show any sign of toxicity in Swiss-Albino mice. The total number of Annexin V positive cells is increased in tumours of p-PD treated mice. This observation substantiates our in vitro finding that p-PD mediates apoptotic death of melanoma cells.",
