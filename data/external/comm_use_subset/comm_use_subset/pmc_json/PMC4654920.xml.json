            "text": "In February 1996, more than 100 elderly people living alone in Hong Kong died during an unexpected long cold spell, which is excessive in comparison to the same period in the previous years. In response to this incident, in the same year a non-government organization, the Hong Kong Senior Citizen Home Safety Association (SCHSA), established a personal emergency (PE) link service to render emergency relief and total care service to all elderly and chronic invalids. All subscribers of this service are linked through an advanced communication system to a 24-hour call center. By pressing a button on a main unit or the button on a portable necklace type or wristwatch type remote trigger, the service user can establish communication to the call center through the main unit at home. As of November 2007 the accumulated number of users of this service has reached 100,000.",

            "text": "There is substantial variation in the daily numbers of calls received in the Center. To facilitate appropriate and efficient resource allocation it is desirable to be able to predict the intensity of service use based on factors that can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, such as weather conditions. To this end it is important to study the relation of the service use intensity and the weather conditions (for example, temperature and humidity) based on historical data. A recent work [1] about the association between the frequency of such PE Link calls and meteorological factors found that the effect of temperature on the call frequency was statistically significant and the effect function was roughly U-shaped. When the temperature reached about 30\u201332 \u00b0C, the health related PE Link call frequency started to increase. The major concern of the study was the negative impact of hot weather on health, and only used data in warm seasons in Hong Kong. A more recent study [2] on the association between hospital admissions and weather and other environmental variables in Hong Kong found increased admissions were linked to increases of temperature above a threshold during warm seasons and decreases of temperature below a threshold during cold seasons. Another study [3] also found strong associations between cold weather and mortality rate in Hong Kong and Taiwan during cold seasons. The main purpose of the current work is to examine the association between the frequency of PE Link calls that lead to hospital admissions and meteorological factors, especially cold weather, using year-around data regardless of the season.",

This motivated us to consider the Poisson GLM (Generalized Linear Model) regression as a first attempt. The response variable is the daily number of PE Link calls received by the call center that lead to hospital admissions. The explanatory variables included the daily temperature, the humidity and the range of temperature fluctuations. As our main concern is the impact of cold weather on service use, the temperature variable we use is the daily minimum temperature. The daily temperature range was calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum recorded temperatures. Since previous studies suggest the effect of weather on health status tends to be nonlinear [1\u20136], the impact of each of these meteorological variables was modeled as a polynomial function over the respective range of the variable. The degrees of the polynomials were selected using a popular model selection method, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [7].",

The degree of the polynomial for the time trend was selected together with the degrees of the polynomial effect functions for the meteorological variables in the model selection process using the AIC. As previous studies suggests that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 might have influenced the call rate as well [8], the indicator for the duration of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, 4 Feb\u201321 May 2003, was also included in the model.",

Therefore, the residuals from fitting the simplified model was examined for significant auto-correlations by visually inspecting the ACF (auto-correlation function) plot. If significant auto-correlation was detected, then Poisson GLARMA (Generalized Linear Auto-Regressive Moving-Average) model [9, 10] would be fitted to the data to account for any auto-correlation among the count time series.",

Similar auto-correlation among the humidity and temperature range variables was also observed; see Figs. 3 and 4 for the graphs of the average call rate against humidity and temperature range respectively at different lags.

Therefore, a negative binomial GLARMA model was refitted to the data. The diagnostic plots for this model are shown in Fig. 5. It reveals fitted values for the response closely tracing the observed counts, white-noise looking residual time series that have no trend or serial correlation, and uniformly distributed PIT (Probability Integral Transform) residuals [11, 12].

The estimated weekday effects suggest that Monday on average sees 9.34 % (95 % CI: [5.89 %,12.91 %]) more calls per 10,000 subscribers than Sunday.
