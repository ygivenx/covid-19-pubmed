Tremendous effort has been spent on studying this protein in order to identify therapeutics against the SARS-CoV in particular and other pathogenic coronaviruses (e.g. MERS-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in general because they share similar active sites and enzymatic mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to build a molecular model of the 3CL\npro of the SARS-CoV-2 and to carry out virtual screening to identify readily usable therapeutics.

Both are marketed as approved drugs in combination with sofosbuvir, which is a prodrug nucleotide analogue inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or NS5B). Interestingly, sofosbuvir has recently been proposed as an antiviral for the SARS-CoV-2 based on the similarity between the replication mechanisms of the HCV and the coronaviruses\n14. Our results further strengthen that these dual-component HCV drugs, Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), may be attractive candidates to repurpose because they may inhibit two coronaviral enzymes. A drug that can target two viral proteins substantially reduces the ability of the virus to develop resistance.

However, some scientists did express scepticism\n19. By analogy, these compounds were speculated to act on SARS-CoV 3CL\npro specifically, but there is as yet no crystal structure to support that, although docking studies were carried out to propose various binding modes\n20\u2013\n23. The IC\n50 value of lopinavir is 50 \u03bcM (\nK\ni = 14 \u03bcM) and that for ritonavir cannot be established\n24. Although this is far from a cure, based on our results that the two CoV 3CL\npro enzymes are identical as far as protein sequences and substrate specificities are concerned, we are of the opinion that this is still one of the recommended routes for immediate treatment at the time of writing (early February 2020).
