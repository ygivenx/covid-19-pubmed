Nevertheless, especially with respect to the pathogenesis of HBoV strains causing respiratory infections, the CaCo\u20102 model remains limited, although the study by Ghietto and coworkers unintendedly confirmed the previous assumption that HBoV displays a tropism to colorectal tumors.8, 9\n",

T84 cells could be easily grown as monolayer cultures and by mounting them on filter membranes coated with rat or human collagen can be differentiated into a multilayer respiratory epithelium (detailed protocols on request). None of the culturing steps requires any specialized cell culture media, thus making the cell line an economically acceptable tool for research.",

After 3\u20104 weeks of culture in on filter membranes, the polarity of the T84 cells was determined based on the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) using an epithelial volt\u2010ohm meter (Millipore). HBoV1 infection was performed at minimal values of 600\u2010800 \u03a9 per insert, which most likely goes ahead with differentiation of the cells. Six hours after inoculation, the cells were washed three times before the first basal medium was harvested 24 hours post\u2010inoculation. HBoV infectious particles were thereby derived from HEK293 cells transfected with an HBoV\u20101 plasmid as previously described by Huang et al,5 2014.",

            "text": "As an active HBoV infection is characterized by a viremia, that is, a release of viral particles into the blood stream, HBoV replication was measured by the number of HBoV DNA copies that were released to the basal cell culture medium. Except for 100 \u03bcL inoculum, we did observe an increase in viral particles up to one log10 in all cases (Figure 1), indicating that active replication occurred and viral particles were released to the basal cell culture medium. None of the filters became leaky, and even after 7 days of infection, no cell culture medium was visible on the apical surface of the air\u2010liquid interface cultures. In addition, we have tried to isolate HBoV from bronchoalveolar lavages. In 4 of 8 attempts, we were able to observe the release of viral DNA into the basal medium, giving raise to the assumption that the T84 cell culture system could also become a tool for classical virus isolation. Further preliminary approaches with productive infections support the conclusion that passaging of HBoV on T84 may also be possible as the medium of T84 cells freshly inoculated with medium previously tested positive also became positive by qPCR. Although this has to be confirmed by further trials, T84 could supplement the CaCo\u20102 model and, in concert with the CaCo\u20102 cell model, could serve as a tool for studying HBoV replication and identification of host factors that enable the cell type\u2013specific mechanisms leading to productive HBoV infection. Moreover, as broadly available cell lines, CaCo\u20102 and T84 could serve as a basis for more HBoV research even in less specialized laboratories.",
