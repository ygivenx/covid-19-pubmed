The Southeast Asia Region (SEAR), home to a quarter of the world's population, was also certified polio-free in March 2014 [4]. WHO certified Taiwan, along with the entire WPR, as polio-free in 2000 and Taiwan changed its immunization strategy from oral (OPV) to inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in 2010. To date, WPV remains endemic in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Numerous outbreaks in heretofore polio-free regions have been reported recently in China (2011), Somalia (2013), Ethiopia (2013), and Kenya (2013) caused by importation [5\u20137]. Besides WPV, cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) causing acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have risen since 2000, and have been identified in eight countries in 2013 and in two countries in May 2014 [8].",

For instance, although certified as polio-free in 2002, Israel isolated WPV in routine environmental sewage samples in early February 2013, and immediate steps were taken to implement national supplementary immunization with OPV to prevent its spread [14]. Recently, the WHO included environmental poliovirus surveillance in a new strategic plan as part of its global eradication initiative to supplement AFP surveillance [15]. In Taiwan, AFP surveillance has long been established for poliovirus surveillance of the population, but environmental surveillance is not routinely performed.",

            "text": "Besides poliovirus in populations, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, and noroviruses are often found in environmental raw sewage [16\u201319]. These groups of viruses can cause a broad range of asymptomatic to severe gasterointestinal or respiratory infections [20], or even more acute conditions such as meningitis and paralysis [21], thus constituting a considerable public health problem in the community. Among these fecal-oral viral pathogens, reovirus is usually the most abundant virus detected in environmental water [22, 23]. Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), which belongs to the family Reoviridae and the genus Orthoreovirus, are a common class of enteric viruses capable of infecting a broad range of mammalian species, including humans. Previous studies have indicated that reoviruses have a high endemic infection rate in humans [24] and seroconversion was found in more than 70% of 4-year-old children [25]. Although reovirus infection in humans usually induces mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, there are reports of human reovirus-associated neurological disease [26, 27]. Several studies also described the isolation of reovirus strains directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or neural tissues obtained from patients with meningitis or encephalitis [28\u201331]. In addition, immunocompromised, pediatric, and elderly populations may become susceptible to severe bacterial respiratory disease due to an initial reovirus infection [32, 33].",

An unexpected PCR product was observed. After sequencing and blasting the NCBI database, the PCR products were identified as mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV). A possible reason for the unexpected identification of MRV by PanEV RT-PCR may be due to the similarity between the primer and L1 gene of MRV, as MRV was formerly classified as ECHO 10 [37]. In a study by Lelli et al., specific primers for the L1 region of all types of MRV were then applied to isolates which stained positive for the PanEV blend antibody in L20B cells [38].

Fig 4 shows the phylogenetic analysis of three serotypes of MRV based upon the S1 gene (nucleotides 147 to 1253) sequences. Thirty-one MRV were identified, including thirteen Type 1 (MRV1), fifteen Type 2 (MRV2), and three Type 3 (MRV3).

Sequence analysis and the phylogenetic tree showed that MRV1 and MRV2 persistently circulated in Taiwan and most MRV isolated in Taiwan was closely related to the reference strains isolated from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome or meningitis reported previously in other countries.",

The results showed that coxsackievirus type B, echoviruses, adenoviruses, and mammalian orthoreoviruses were isolated from the sewage specimens with a positive rate of 54.3%, but no poliovirus was found. Among these, enteroviruses (34.3%) and MRV (35.1%) predominated, followed by adenovirus (30.6%). Based on data provided by the WHO, at least 30% of concentrated sewage from grab samples can be expected to test positive for NPEV [41]. Therefore, the high rate of non-polio enteroviruses in the environment can be considered proof that the environmental samples were processed and analyzed appropriately to preserve virus infectivity. This study was undertaken to supplement poliovirus surveillance in Taiwan by monitoring the possible presence of wild-type (WPV) or vaccine-derived (cVDPV) poliovirus in wastewater with a view to obtaining further evidence supporting the maintenance of Taiwan's polio-free status.",

Among coxsackievirus B strains, CVB2, CVB3, and CVB4 were the most prevalent between July 2012 and 2013 in Taiwan; however, CVB1 and CVB6 were not isolated in this study. According to a surveillance report by Taiwan's Centers of Disease Control (Taiwan CDC), among the coxsackievirus B strains, CVB3 and CVB4 were more frequent in 2012, whereas CVB2 and CVB4 predominated in 2013. This phenomenon was in agreement with the results of this study that showed the majority subtype of coxsackievirus B in 2012 was CVB3, which shifted to CVB2 and CVB4 in 2013. The results indicated that the environmental virus strains reflect the viruses circulating in the population and highlight the potential risk of viruses spreading via wastewater. In addition, the rare isolation of coxsackievirus type A in our study might be related to the lower susceptibility of the cells used to isolate the viruses or the lower resistance of the viruses in the environment and the isolation process.",

            "text": "The unexpected identification of MRV by PanEV RT-PCR may be explained by the sequence similarity between the primers for enterovirus 5\u2032-NTR and L1 gene of MRV, as MRV was formerly classified as ECHO 10. We found MRV was positive for PanEV antibody stain, but failed to be identified by CODEHOP PCR of enteroviruses. This may be attributed to the cross-reactivity of the PanEV Blend antibody toward reoviruses, as noted by the manufacturer in the instructions provided with the kit. According to our results, a high positive rate of MRV was found in our sewage specimens. MRV belongs to the Orthorovirus genus, Spinareovirinae subfamily, Reovirus family, and is also commonly termed reovirus. MRV are non-enveloped viruses that contain 10 segmented double-stranded RNA genomes, including three large (L1-3), three medium (M1-3), and four small (S1-4) segments [39]. It can be classified into three major serotypes: Type 1 Lang (T1L), Type 2 Jones (T2J), and Type 3 Dearing (T3D), which commonly cause asymptomatic infections or mild respiratory tract illness and enteritis in infants and children [37, 59, 60]. Other studies have reported a seropositive rate of more than 70% in 4-year-old children [27, 61]. Recently, a few novel MRV viruses were found in humans, such as, novel Type 2 MRV (MRV2TOU05), which seems to be closely related to porcine and human strains first isolated from 2 children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy in France; the mother of one patient also had influenza-like symptoms, and specific antibodies against MRV2TOU05 were detected [62]. Another novel Type 3 MRV was isolated from a child in the United States with meningitis. The virus also showed systemic spread and was found to produce lethal encephalitis in newborn mice after peroral inoculation [31]. Besides the novel MRV-infected pediatric cases, another novel MRV (Kampar virus) was identified from a throat swab of a 54-year-old patient with high fever, acute respiratory disease, and vomiting. Based on epidemiological tracing, there is a high probability that Kampar virus originated from fruit bats and is capable of causing human to human transmission according to the results of serological studies [63]. In previous studies, reoviruses were commonly found in environmental water sources, and human fecal contamination has been suggested as the source of the virus [64, 65]. Our PCR sequencing data of isolated MRV showed that mammalian orthoreoviruses Types 1, 2, and 3 were present in the environment. Sequence analysis also showed that MRV1 and MRV2 persistently circulated in Taiwan and most MRV isolated in Taiwan were closely related to the reference strains isolated from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome or meningitis. These results suggest that the reoviruses isolated from sewage may have the potential to infect humans. However, no cases of MRV infection have been reported in Taiwan to date. Since the identification of MRV requires additional molecular analysis, it may be missed by routine viral identification. In addition, this study identified MRV from L20B cells, which are not normally used in routine settings. The etiologic agent remains unknown in many cases of encephalitis (32%-75%) [62]. MRV may be a potential risk factor with public health implications. Thus, L20B cell should be tested for routine viral isolation and PCR test is needed to identify MRV when MRV is suspected in human subjects.",

Our results showed that Taiwan was poliovirus vaccine strain-free in the environment two years after the oral poliovirus vaccine was replaced by the inactivated poliovirus vaccine. Although our surveillance data were negative for poliovirus, long-term monitoring is still needed to allow prompt action should WPV ever be detected. In addition, we combined cell culture and RT-PCR to assay large volumes of sewage and identify the viruses, so that infectious viruses could be detected, thereby providing meaningful data that can be applied in public health risk assessments. This is the first study to report the prevalence of MRV in sewage in Taiwan. The observations made in this investigation highlight the potential risk of MRV infection in humans. This report also suggests that continuous periodic surveillance of environmental virus is necessary to prevent the outbreak of disease or reduce casualties. Finally, since MRV was frequently identified in our environmental specimens, it is imperative that human cases with suspected MPV infection be thoroughly evaluated.",
