Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves25 were generated to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the classification methods at different mutation rate in classifying viral reads. (Figure 2 and see Supplementary Information) Nearly all the results shared the superior 100% specificity. The specificity was slightly reduced (99.83%) when classifying the DENV-2 viral reads at 40% mutation rate. The sensitivity was reduced while the mutation rate was increased. Accurate virus identification, where sensitivity >90%, was still achieved for with mutation rate at 20% using optimal parameters. Nevertheless, the overall poor performance in classifying the viral reads at high mutation rate (>20%) required further investigations.",

Furthermore, the VIP has the power to discover more undetected viruses from the dataset. In data source SRR1170820 from Ion Torrent PGM platform, Bovinecircovirus (BoCV) was reported by traditional test, while with VIP in addition to the Bovinecircovirus, the Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) was also identified, and the genome coverage were 99.90% and 86.13% respectively. We also evaluated VIP using additional 3 in-house samples from different sequencing platforms, including 2 mixed samples (sequenced by Hiseq 2000 and 454 respectively). These 3 in-house samples were isolated from stool, serum and swab respectively. For the mixed swab samples, we found Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Human coronavirus 229E using our method, and the genome coverage were 98.41% and 17.00% respectively, it is worth noting that the number of reads of Human coronavirus 229E was only 262, which was merely 0.01 percent of its total reads (5,147,814 reads), the presence of Human coronavirus 229E was then confirmed by nested PCR experiment. VIP was able to correctly identify the virus types for all of these samples and hence demonstrated its robustness in virus detection.",

The subsequent phylogenetic tree also located this sequence to DENV-1 branch, confirming the percentage coverage result.

The price of NGS is falling dramatically in some cases below the price of traditional identification methods. NGS has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for the detection of pathogens in clinical samples. Viral metagenomics provides comprehensive viral pathogen identification in a single assay. However, bioinformatics analysis for viral metagenomics has been the bottleneck when deploying NGS for virus identification due to the absence of a designated bioinformatician in most laboratories. Our goal is to establish a one-touch computational pipeline in routine laboratories for virus identification from metagenomics NGS data generated from complex clinical samples.",

Both SURPI and VIP shared generally the same strategy \u201csubtraction to identification\u201d. SURPI searched against the entire both nucleotide and amino acid collection from NCBI (nt/nr) for comprehensive identification of pathogen. Coverage map, a very attractive feature provided in SURPI, was also carried out in VIP with strategy as previously described. The major difference was the way to select the close reference. SURPI would map to all nucleotide reference sequences corresponding to that genus picked out during alignment. VIP will choose a close reference based on abundance of reference genome due to the proposed hypothesis that the genome coverage percentage was alongside with the sequencing depth. The approaches for assembly share little similarity. VIP implemented the \u201cclassification to assembly\u201d while SURPI used the entire data set to perform assembly. Results suggested higher N50 were achieved by VIP. (Data not shown) Compare to other pathogens, like bacteria, fungi and parasite, most viral pathogens are RNA viruses which suggested the potentially high mutation rate or divergent genomes. It could be impossible to find a suitable reference genome during alignment procedure in some cases which undermined the coverage map and underscored the phylogenetic analysis. The construction of a phylogenetic tree allows us to visualize the underlying genealogy between the candidate divergent virus and existing reference sequences. The overall effective de novo assemblies benefitted from the classification method in VIP generated longer and accurate contig to help construct the phylogenetic tree. Nevertheless, SURPI was proved to provide more comprehensive information for pathogen identification by searching against nt/nr while VIP focused on viruses. (see Supplementary Table S3 and S4).",

Notably, VIP can efficiently handle NGS data generated from animals and complex metagenomics samples such as stool and respiratory secretions, which are exposed to the environment and contain a large proportion of non-host sequences (Table 1). The two-step classification approach achieved high sensitivity and specificity where virus mutation rate were less than 20%.

VIP will determine the encoding version of the input data. This is necessary to make sure those differences in the way the quality scores were generated from different sequencing platforms are properly taken into consideration during preprocessing. VIP can also accept FastA format raw NGS data. The quality control step, however, will only perform sequence-based strategies, such as the complexity and length as main factors. Generally, the quality control step is comprised of trimming low-quality and adapter reads, removing low-complexity sequences using the DUST algorithm and retaining reads of trimmed length >20 bp using PRINSEQ31. In fast mode, Bowtie2 alignments are first performed against the host DB followed by removing the host-related sequences. The remaining reads are subject to ViPR/IRD nucleotide DB. In sense mode, the initial alignment against host DB and bacteria DB is followed by subtraction of reads mapped. Background-subtracted reads are then subject to a virus subset of NCBI nt DB.",

Reads from mutation region of these viruses might be unclassified or classified into other species or strains. In order to avoid the misclassifications caused by mutations, we applied a two-steps computational alignment strategy for classification in VIP (Fig. 4). In the first step, all matched reads will be assigned to a specific gene identifier (GI) after nucleotide/amino acid alignment. These reads are therefore taxonomically classified to genus level by lookup of matched GI from the NCBI taxonomy database by SQL (Structured Query Language). i.e According to the GI, the scientific names for each reference records, which are composed of the species, genus and family information, are achieved and appended to the alignment results.",

Here we hypothesized the genome coverage percentage was alongside with the sequencing depth for specific reference sequences. In other words the higher abundance of a genome suggested the higher possibility to recover its genome. All the reference sequences with the following key words are kept: (1) complete genomes; (2) complete sequences; or (3) complete cds. Assigned reads are directly mapped to all nucleotide reference sequences selected using optimal BLASTn at reward/penalty score (1/\u22121).

We present the Multiple-k method in which various k-mer lengths are used for de novo assembly with Velvet-Oases343536.
