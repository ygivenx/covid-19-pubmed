PEDV infection is a highly contagious infectious disease and is characterized by watery diarrhea, and vomiting leading to dehydration [3]. PEDV can infect all ages of pigs and the exhibition of clinical signs vary according to the age of pigs [4]. Morbidity and mortality rate of PEDV infection may reach up to 100% in piglets but variable in adult pigs [5]. Nowadays, PEDV infection has become endemic in North and South America, Asia and Europe, causing significant economic losses in the worldwide swine industry [3, 6].",

For the control of PED, not only symptomatic pigs, but also asymptomatic pigs should be detected to confirm whether PEDV infection is still present or not. Serum Neutralization test (NT) is the gold standard of serological assay for PEDV specific antibodies detection due to its high specificity in Japan. However, this test is laborious and, time-consuming, requiring manual result reading, interpretation of virus induced cytopathic effect endpoints and reduction of NT titer due to virus mutation [12, 13], while ELISA test is simple, easy, rapid and accurate and can screen large number of serum samples [9, 11]. To apply for the monitoring and the surveillance of PEDV infection, indirect ELISA is more preferable for PED detection. The objective of this study is the development and optimization of indirect ELISA assay for the detection of anti-PEDV antibodies and evaluate the efficacy of indirect ELISA test as a diagnostic method for PEDV infection.",

After that, the PEDV outbreak occurred again in 1996 and PEDV infection become sporadic. From late 2013 to 2015, a PEDV infection re-emerged with high mortality. Currently, PEDV infections occur sporadically in Japan (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan). It has been reported that pig farms with no PEDV clinical signs contained subclinical PEDV seropositive animals, which were detected by NT [17]. Considering this situation for controlling PED, we need to survey and monitor the PEDV infection. NT is useful in sero-surveillance of both recent and post PEDV infection [17]. However, NT has some disadvantages such as being laborious, time consuming and mutated neutralizing related epitope. The development of a simple, rapid, specific and economic technique is urgently needed for the detection of PEDV infection. Therefore, indirect ELISA for anti-PEDV antibody detection was developed and optimized the accuracy of assay in this study.",

Validation of indirect ELISA tests experienced variation and experimentally infected serum was used to evaluate the validity of test. Recombinant PEDV structural protein based ELISAs increase specificity but sensitivity can reduce due to heterogenicity of PEDV isolates [22, 23]. On the other hand, whole virus coated ELISA can produce high background, cross- reactivity with other viral antibodies and low specificity [11, 18]. However, the purified whole virus antigen involves all virally expressed proteins that increases sensitivity [24]. Moreover, whole viral antigen coated indirect ELISA is more sensitive than the PEDV structural protein based ELISA in the detection of heterogeneous strain [25]. Based on these advantages, whole viral antigen was used as an ELISA antigen in this study in order to improve the detection sensitivity for field serum samples. Whole NK94P6 PED virus was used as a coated antigen in the present study because this strain is gold standard strain in Japan.",

Another possibility is that indirect ELISA is more sensitive than the NT. There may be reduction of NT titer due to virus mutation in neutralizing epitope.

Ninety-six wells ELISA plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) were coated with 50 \u03bcl of this solution and incubated at 4 \u00b0C, overnight. The plates were washed with 300 \u03bcl of washing buffer (0.05% Tween PBS) 4 times, blocked with 150 \u03bcl of blocking reagent for ELISA (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. After incubation, blocking reagent was completely aspirated and the plates were dried at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h. Then, all of the plates were sealed and kept at 4 \u00b0C until used.",
