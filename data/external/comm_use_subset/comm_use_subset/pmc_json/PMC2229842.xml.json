The main goal was to provide tools for shared access and manipulation of specific software systems or scientific instruments. Such an emphasis on tools was necessary in these early development years because of the lack of basic collaboration tools\u2014text chat, synchronous audio, videoconferencing\u2014to support rudimentary levels of communication and interaction. Today, however, such tools are available in off-the-shelf software packages, such as Microsoft LiveMeeting, and IBM Lotus Sametime. The design of collaboratories can move beyond developing general communication mechanisms to evaluating and supporting data sharing in the scientific context. New communication channels can be added to facilitate collaborative exchange of ideas and data. Social network services are an example of a novel communication channel that has attracted large numbers of participants. Services like MySpace and Facebook provide a web site for members with similar interests to interact and share information through a variety of formats, such as, discussion groups, voice and video, file sharing, and email. The success of these services has to be considered within a scientific context to provide an effective on-line environment for scientific collaboration.",

Effective proteome-wide prediction of cell signaling interactions require that data on biological relevance, structural accessibility, and molecular sequence be combined to allow for the accurate modeling of cell signaling pathways, for example [3]. When structural genomics intersect with functional proteomics, real-time three-dimensional (3-D) annotation is needed to integrate the two by providing the structural contextual basis upon which to attach the functional information.",

Research teams are increasingly interdisciplinary and collaborative among laboratories in different departments and institutions located around the world, so it is important for them to have the tools to bridge the gaps of specialization, geography, and time. Researchers must employ data organization and workflow management tools to share the context of their data. The ability to quickly search and retrieve complex 3-D data in real time is critical to the efficiency and productivity of large-scale research work. Currently, the insufficient level of detail made available by published literature, both in print and online, makes it challenging for researchers to share their knowledge. For instance, data from large-scale structural genomics initiatives , such as, PSI I & II (US), SGC (Europe), SPINE (Europe), RIKEN (Japan), will require centralized and automated facilities across continents, new methods to divide labor, and novel tools to disseminate and annotate the data to put it into the larger scientific context of systems biology.",

Developed at Duke University Medical Center, Kinemage illustrated a particular idea about a 3-D object, rather than neutrally displaying that object [4]. Kinemages, at the time, were a new type of published illustration, providing 3-D views in addition to standard figures, stereo figures, and color plates. Operations on the displayed Kinemage could be rotated in real time, parts of the display could be turned on or off, points could be identified and annotated, and changes between different forms could be animated. This was the first widely available molecular viewing and communication tool that allowed researchers to better communicate ideas that depended on 3-D information.",

However, since we are leveraging MOSS 2007 for the data organization and storage functionality, we are using the .NET 3.0 Framework and WPF because of their tight integration with the Microsoft Windows and Server systems [9]. WPF is the graphical subsystem of the .NET 3.0 Framework and provides a programming model for building applications with a separation between the user interface and the underlying logic. The built-in WPF features for rendering 2D and 3D graphic objects were particularly helpful in more quickly assembling the functionality that supports C-ME. The rapid prototyping has enabled us to review iterations of the prototypes in two-week cycles providing bug and usability feedback to the developers for the next cycle of development.",

The instructor prepares appropriate annotations ahead of class time, and students reviewing the material after class can add comments or leave questions for the instructor. Additionally, image-based medical specialties can use the features of C-ME for education. In a pathology fellowship training program, where visual microscopic skills are paramount, learning modules for various pathologic diseases are created. This gives trainees the opportunity to practice making diagnoses by looking at microscopic images, as they will in their future daily practice. But unlike in real life, these microscopic images come with embedded annotations, files, PowerPoint presentations and on-line literature reviews, highlighting the corresponding disease information the trainees need to master in association with each image of abnormal cells.
