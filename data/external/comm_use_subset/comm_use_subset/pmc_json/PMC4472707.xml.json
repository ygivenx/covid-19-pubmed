A safe level of PPE is essential when treating patients with highly infectious diseases or those contaminated with hazardous substances. The recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa has highlighted that, although uncommon, contagious diseases with high mortality rates can be a threat to healthcare systems at local, national, and international levels [1]. Chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) contamination presents similar risks.",
