According to an online report by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 310 thousand people were hospitalized because of influenza-related illness during the 2015-2016 influenza season [1]. At present, vaccine and antiviral drugs are the major countermeasures against influenza virus infection. However, vaccination needs to be conducted annually as the body's immune response from vaccine declines over time and influenza viruses constantly change [2]. Besides, the influenza vaccine is not suitable for people who are severely allergic to chicken eggs [3]. Moreover, current antiviral drugs including M2 and neuraminidase (NA) protein inhibitors would be limited by the appearance of resistant viruses [4]. In fact, apart from viral factors, host factors are also important during the process of influenza virus infection [5]. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including influenza virus, which results in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [6]. Type I IFNs exhibit a non-redundant effect. Type I IFNs inhibit virus replication, boost adaptive immunity and limit acute lung injury [7, 8]. Therefore, novel anti-influenza virus drugs targeting host factors is worth discovering. Our group previously had utilized restraint stress to disrupt type I IFN secretion and increase the susceptibility to H1N1 influenza virus. Based on this model, we have successfully evaluated the anti-influenza efficacy of several traditional Chinese medicines or natural products, such as apple polyphenols, Sarcandra glabra extract, and ReDuNing injection [9\u201311].",

Recent studies also showed that it had antiviral activities against Japanese encephalitis virus, rabies, influenza A and some other viruses [12, 14\u201318]. Indirubin, a bisindole alkaloid, is the main active ingredient of Isatis indigotica. Mak and his colleagues proved the antiviral activity of indirubin against influenza by inhibiting the production of the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted in human bronchial epithelial cells infected with influenza virus [17]. Chang's laboratory showed indirubin had an antiviral effect on Japanese encephalitis virus through blocking virus attachment [14]. However, these are in vitro studies, further in vivo studies are required. Indirubin also shows the anti-inflammatory effect as it has been reported to inhibit the inflammatory reactions of delayed-type hypersensitivity [19]. These previous studies suggest indirubin is a potential agent against influenza virus, but its underlying mechanism retains unclear. For such purpose, restraint-stressed mouse model along with stress hormone corticosterone (CORT)-loaded A549 cell model is employed to investigate the anti-influenza effect of indirubin and explore its mechanism.",

However, the average body weight of mice in the \u201cStress+Virus\u201d group did not recover until day 10. Compared to the \u201cStress+Virus\u201d group, oseltamivir, indirubin-H and indirubin-L treatment could significantly maintain the body weight of restraint-stressed mice infected with influenza virus. The morbidity of the mouse was estimated when its weight was decreased over 1 g\u00b7d\u22121.

The data above indicated a role of indirubin on alleviating the morbidity of stressed mice infected with influenza virus, which was also supported by the improvement of behavioral changes, such as the altered respiration and ruffed fur. Then, we calculated the survivals and estimated the mortality of mice in each group.

            "text": "Nucleoprotein (NP) level indicates the replication state of influenza virus. As shown in Figure 3A, NP protein expression in lungs of \u201cStress+Virus\u201d group increased remarkably (P < 0.01), comparing with Virus group. However, indirubin treatment obviously reduced NP protein level (P < 0.01). Influenza virus is recognized by host sensors, which results in type I IFNs secretion [6]. Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b2, activate innate antiviral responses to suppress virus replication. Besides, IFN-\u03b2 could induce the expression of interferon inducible transmembrane 3 (IFITM3), which inhibits viral RNA from translocating into nuclear for replication and appreciation [21]. In the present study, both IFN-\u03b2 and IFITM3 protein expressions were obviously decreased in the lung tissues in stressed mice following H1N1 infection, which was inhibited by indirubin treatment (Figure 3B). We next explored how indirubin induced IFN-\u03b2 production and paid attention to MAVS signaling. The detection of virus RNA by RIG-I, the essential PRR within cells, will lead to the aggregation of MAVS. This signaling results in the activation of NF-\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which respectively stimulated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs [22]. In our study, we found that the protein expressions of MAVS and phosphorylation of IRF3 declined, while the protein expression of NF-\u03baB increased in the lungs of mice in \u201cStress+Virus\u201d group (P < 0.01), comparing with Virus group. Indirubin treatment elevated MAVS expression and promoted the phosphorylation of IRF3 in the lung tissues (Figure 3C and Figure 3D). On the contrary, NF-\u03baB expression was reduced by indirubin (Figure 3D), indicating other intracellular pathways, such as Toll-like receptors, are also involved.",

The concentrations of 5 \u03bcM, 7.5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM of indirubin were selected based on its influence on cell viability in normal cells and CORT-loaded cells (data not shown). Western blotting results showed that indirubin at 7.5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM inhibited influenza virus replication and enhanced the expression of antiviral protein IFN-\u03b2 and IFITM3 (Figure 4A). Then, 10 \u03bcM of indirubin was chosen to explore the influence of indirubin on MAVS antiviral signaling. The protein expressions of MAVS, p-IRF3, IFN-\u03b2 and IFITM3 were remarkably declined in CORT-loaded A549 cells following influenza virus infection, while indirubin treatment improved their productions (P < 0.01) (Figure 4B and Figure 4C).

We next examined the changes of mitochondrial morphology by immunofluorescence. Confocal images indicated that small fragmented mitochondria occurred in CORT-loaded A549 cells with or without influenza virus infection, which disrupted the location of MAVS. Furthermore, indirubin treatment maintained the mitochondrial morphology and MAVS expression and location. Furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured by flow cytometry with JC-1 staining. As shown in Figure 6C, a remarkable increase of green fluorescence intensity in A549 cells following virus infection was aggravated by CORT pretreatment.

A recent study found that IAV-infected monocytes from elder humans were impaired in the production of antiviral interferons [29]. It was reported that restraint stress suppressed NK activity, decreased the number of lymphocyte cells, altered antibodies production and inflammatory response [30\u201332]. Our previous studies had shown restraint stress disrupted type I IFN secretion and increased the susceptibility to H1N1 influenza virus with an increased risk of dying and duration of complications [9], which paralleled to clinical features of the susceptible population [10]. The activation of hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis is an important indicator of the stress response, resulting in CORT secretion [33, 34]. Studies found that CORT-induced immune suppression was the underlying mechanism of increased mortality [35]. Our previous studies have utilized CORT to establish influenza susceptibility model in A549 cells [36]. Therefore, we employed restraint-stressed mice model and CORT-loaded A549 cell model to evaluate the protective effect of indirubin on influenza susceptibility. Firstly, we evaluated its influence on the morbidity of mice caused by influenza infection in stressed mice. Results indicated that mice suffered from sickness in a certain proportion after intranasal administration of influenza virus, and restraint stress significantly aggravated the morbidity. In contrast, indirubin remarkably improved the sickness symptoms. Moreover, we also appraised the effect of indirubin on the health status of mice by their changes of body weights. Several previous reports demonstrated that after influenza virus infection, the body weights of mice decreased first and increased afterwards, although the time period of decrease depends on the type and amount of influenza virus and as well as host factors [21, 37, 38]. Our data indicated that indirubin maintained the body weights of mice in a relatively stable status, preventing a sharp drop in the early days caused by stress plus virus. Secondly, we evaluated the influence of indirubin on the mortality of mice. Results showed that indirubin significantly suppressed the decline of survival rate caused by influenza infection in stressed mice. Thirdly, the anti-influenza effect of indirubin was also noticed in the CORT-loaded A549 cell model, reflected by the reduced NP level. The above in vitro and in vivo observations demonstrated an improving effect of indirubin on reducing H1N1 susceptibility caused by stress.",

Our results indicated that indirubin treatment could mitigate lung edema and inflammatory cells infiltration caused by influenza virus infection in stressed mice. When the host is infected with influenza virus, macrophages, neutrophils are recruited into the lung and produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid the immune response and limit influenza virus spread [40]. However, the cytokine storm with excessive chemokines and cytokines may lead to lung damage. Studies in animal models have found the excessive level of TNF-\u03b1 contributed to the development of pulmonary lesions correlated with an acute inflammatory response [41]. IL-1\u03b2 mediates acute pulmonary inflammatory pathology [42]. A report from Kaiser's lab found IL-6 was related to symptom scores and temperature values in experimental human infection [43]. IL-10, as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, mediates lung inflammation controlled by effector T cells [44]. Moreover, blocking IL-10 activity in the course of infection leads to the overproduction of proinflammatory mediators [45\u201347]. Our results showed that indirubin treatment lessened the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 while enhanced the production of IL-10 in the lung tissues of influenza-infected mice loaded with stress. Our results found that indirubin exerted an anti-inflammation effect. All the results above indicated that indirubin ameliorated viral pneumonia in restraint-stressed mice.",

            "text": "Upon influenza virus infection, PAMPs recognize virus by PRRs and results in type I IFNs secretion [6]. Type I IFNs stimulate the expression of genes which are termed ISGs and play an important role in the antiviral state [6]. Among ISGs, IFITM3 restricts influenza A viral replication through blocking virus\u2013host cell membrane fusion in the early step [48, 49]. In the in vivo studies, IFITM3 is found to be critical for protecting the host from influenza A virus, resulting in restricting the morbidity and mortality [21]. In the present study, indirubin resisted the decrease of IFN-\u03b2 and IFITM3 protein expressions induced by influenza infection in stressed mice and CORT-loaded A549 cells. Then, we explored if the effect of indirubin on IFN-\u03b2 production was related to the well-known anti-RNA virus pathway, namely RIG-I/MAVS/IRF3. Once detects viral RNA, RIG-I is activated and binds to MAVS located on the outer membrane of mitochondria. This interaction induces the aggregation of MAVS, followed by the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3. This signaling eventually leads to the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN [50]. In our study, indirubin treatment significantly restored the expression of MAVS and promoted the phosphorylation of IRF3 in stressed mice and CORT-loaded A549 cells infected with influenza virus. Unexpectedly, NF-\u03baB level was reduced by indirubin treatment, pointing out that other pathways may be involved the depressing effect on NF-\u03baB, such as Toll-like receptors or inflammasomes. Although this speculation remains to be proved, it coincides with the efficacy of indirubin on lung damage.",

Confocal images and flow cytometry suggested that indirubin treatment inhibited the fragmentation of mitochondria and decline of MMP caused by influenza infection in CORT-loaded A549 cells. This finding was in line with previous two reports. The research from Koshiba's laboratory proved that MMP correlated with MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling and the dissipation in MMP reduced antiviral response [53]. Mitochondria change morphology through membrane fission and fusion, and Mfn2 plays a decisive role in the process. A previous research found mitochondrial morphology was drastically changed by overexpression of Mfn2, resulting in small fragmented mitochondria [27]. In the present study, restraint stress and CORT, respectively, induced an elevation of Mfn2 protein expression in mice and A549 cells. This change was suppressed by indirubin treatment. The results above can well explain why indirubin recovered the mitochondrial network and promoted MAVS signaling.",
