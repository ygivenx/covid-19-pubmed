The type member is Borna disease virus (BDV), the causative agent of Borna disease, an often fatal neurological disease occurring mainly in horses and sheep in endemic regions of central Europe. The natural host range, prevalence, and geographic distribution of BDV are broad [1]. For example, recent studies demonstrated the existence of an avian reservoir of diverse bornaviruses [2] and provided evidence that bornaviruses are the etiologic agent for proventricular dilatation disease, a neuroinflammatory disease of psittacine birds [3]. It is yet to be established whether bornaviruses causes any overt disease in humans. However, correlative evidence exists linking BDV infection with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder [4,5].",

            "text": "BDV is noncytolytic and highly neurotropic [6]. Although viral RNA and proteins are readily detectable in BDV-infected cells, production of cell-free virions or cell-associated infectivity is absent or extremely low [7]. BDV propagates via cell-to-cell spread within the central nervous system and cultured cells in the absence of detectable assembled virions [8,9]. It is likely that BDV initially interacts with the plasma membrane, followed by endocytosis and penetration by membrane fusion; cell-to-cell spread of bornaviruses may involve distinct mechanisms [10]. The BDV genome contains at least six open reading frames (ORF), and the product of BDV ORF IV corresponds to the type I surface glycoproteins found in other viruses of the order Mononegavirales. The BDV glycoprotein (G, GP-C, gp84) migrates due to extensive glycosylation with an apparent molecular mass of 84,000 to 94,000 kilodaltons (kDa). BDV G is post-translationally cleaved by the cellular subtilisin-like protease furin [11,10]. The amino terminal product (GP1, Gn, gp41) has an apparent molecular mass of 41 kDa. GP1 was initially difficult to detect in infected cells or virions due to its high glycan content, which shields antigenic sites from antibodies. However, a peptide-generated antibody was used to demonstrate the presence of GP1 in virions and infected cells [12]. The carboxyl terminal product, molecular mass 43 kDa (GP2, Gc, gp43), is less heavily glycosylated and readily detected in infected cells and virions. The uncleaved product G accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear region. G is not detected on the plasma membrane, whereas GP2, but not GP1, accumulates at the cell surface [10]. There are conflicting results as to the presence of uncleaved G in virions [13,9]. GP2 contains several hydrophobic sequences, and appears capable of mediating cell:cell fusion in the absence of other BDV surface proteins [10,14]. GP1 linked to the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein transmembrane domain (VSV G TM) domain is sufficient, in the absence of GP2, for receptor recognition, cell fusion and entry [15].",

Subsequent studies, using X-ray crystallography and other methods, confirmed all essential features of our structural models suggesting that these modeling methods are highly robust [19,40,34]. The PHD algorithm predicts protein secondary structure from multiple sequence alignments by a system of neural networks, and is rated at an expected average accuracy of 72% for three states, helix, strand and loop [36]. This algorithm predicts that there is a region that forms an extended \u03b1-helix in BVD G (aa 284-338) and other bornaviruses (not shown). A prominent feature of class III VFPs is an extended \u03b1-helix beginning near the carboxyl terminal third of the ectodomain (helix F in domain III, Fig 1), which is involved in trimerization of the post-fusion structure [30,32,34]. The longest \u03b1-helix predicted by PHD in BVD G corresponds to this location (Fig. 1, aa 251-280). Two shorter helices corresponding to helices G and H of VSV G are also predicted by the PHD algorithm in BVD G (aa 284-297, 392-402). With the exception of these \u03b1-helices, the ectodomains of BVD G are predicted to be comprised mostly of \u03b2-sheets, as is the case with other class III VFP.",

TMpred, an algorithm that identifies possible transmembrane helices, assigns a significant score (2578, >500 is statistically significant) to BVD G aa 468-493, which suggests that this sequence includes the transmembrane anchor (violet cones). Two other potential TM segments are present in BDV G (274-294 and 303-327). However, it is not likely that these regions are embedded in the membrane, either in G or GP2 because of the likely dicysteine bonding between cysteines 272 and 317 or other potential linkages involving cysteine 317. PHD analyses also predict the presence of an \u03b1-helical stem domain with several aromatic aa prior to the transmembrane anchor (aa 445-474), a feature present in both class II and III VFP [41,42]. Therefore, we have designated the sequence 475-493 as the transmembrane anchor, recognizing that the stem domain, which contains several aromatic amino acids, is likely to interface with the viral membrane.",

The cysteines of class III (and class II) VFPs determined by X-ray crystallography are arranged such that disulfide bonds are formed between cysteine residues within the same domain. To determine the plausibility of the proposed alignment, a model of BDV G scaffolded on the structure of VSV G in the post-fusion (low pH) configuration [30] was constructed (Fig. 3). The alignment between VSV and BDV G suggest that these VFPs may have a similar structure. Therefore, putative structures in BDV G are depicted as in VSV G. The proposed BDV G model is based principally on the structural predictions of PHD, the most robust secondary structure prediction algorithm used. These results provide evidence that the 10 cysteines in the putative fusion domain (domain II) can potentially bond. Such linkages can stabilize the fusion loops as occurs in both class II and III VFP. The dicysteine linkages are modeled such that all cysteine bonding occurs between the putative domains, as is the case with other class III VFP. After cleavage by furin GP1 and GP2 of BDV appear not to be linked by covalent bonding, as the subunits disassociate during SDS-PAGE [9]. Therefore, we have not modeled any dicysteine linkages between the GP1 and GP2 subunits. There are plausible intradomain linkages that can form between each of the cysteines in BDV G.",

Computational analyses and other methods predict that each of the major features common to class III fusion proteins are present in BVD G, including internal fusion loops, an extended \u03b1 helical domain, a stem domain and a carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain. These features of BDV G are located collinearly with those of VSV G, a prototypic class III VFP [30,31]. On the basis of sequence similarities amongst G of members of the Bornaviridae it is likely that all are class III VFP. Structural models including feasible cysteine linkage maps could be readily established for BDV G using the VSV G post-fusion structure as a scaffold. The fusion domains of BVD G, which we refer to here in a unified domain nomenclature as domain II, appear to be stabilized by cysteine bonds and to contain one or more loops with positive WWIHS scores, features characteristic of the fusion domains of both class II and III VFP. Differences between VSV and BDV G include the presence of a consensus furin cleavage site and a higher number of N-glycosylation sites in BDV G. However, many herpesvirus gB, which are class III VFP, contain a furin cleavage domain prior to the extended \u03b1 helix in domain III and are more heavily glycosylated than VSV G. Therefore, the presence of the furin cleavage site and high glycan content in BDV G does not preclude its putative inclusion in class III. Whether or not the secondary and tertiary folding of BDV GP conforms to the domain structure of class III VFP will require x-ray crystallographic or other physical structural determinations.",

The position of predicted \u03b1 helices, dicysteine linkages and membrane interactive regions (sequences with positive WWIHS scores) are not consistent with assignment of BDV G to class I. However, the concept that multiple domains of bornavirus G participate in fusion of viral and cellular membranes is consistent with current viral entry models. In class I VFP both the amino terminal fusion peptide, the pre-membrane aromatic domain and the TM cooperate to mediate lipid mixing. Likewise, in class II and III VFP, fusion loops in domain II, the stem domain, TM and other WWIHS score positive sequences all appear to participate in fusion.

GP1 sequences are capable of mediating attachment and entry in VSV pseudoparticles in the absence of GP2 [15]. BDV-infected cells exhibit syncytium formation upon exposure to low-pH medium [10]. This pH-dependent cell fusion event is likely mediated by GP2 since it is the only membrane-anchored BDV glycoprotein found on the plasma membrane. These results suggest that both GP1 and GP2 are involved in membrane fusion, either cooperatively or in the case of cell surface expressed GP2 independently. An analogous situation may exist for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our previous modeling suggested that the envelope proteins of HCV split the duties performed by envelope proteins of other members of the Flaviviridae, E of flaviviruses and E2 of pestiviruses [27].

Paramyxoviruses possess a class I VFP, whereas rhabdoviruses and, as suggested here, bornaviruses encode class III VFP. There are several possibilities for how the glycoproteins of members of this order evolved. A G gene appears to have been present in the common ancestors of all members of the Rhabdoviridae and Bornaviridae. The similarities detected between rhabdovirus and bornavirus G are consistent with divergent evolution from a common progenitor, but sequence similarities are insufficient to establish a phylogenic relationship. Therefore, it is possible that the class III VFP of rhabdoviruses and bornaviruses were acquired by independent genetic events. An alternative suggested by Kadlec et al. [34] is that the three classes of VFP may have evolved from a common precursor (pre-class I, II, III). This concept is based on morph videos and other analyses that reveal domain-specific folding and structural similarities amongst each of the three classes of VFP. If this is the case, mononegavirales evolution can be depicted as a \"rooted\" tree with the ancestral mononegavirus possessing a progenitor of class I, III and likely II VFP (Fig. 4A). Alternatively, the VFP of paramyxoviruses could have been acquired independently from the acquisition of glycoproteins by rhabdoviruses and bornaviruses by horizontal gene transfer. This case can be depicted as an unrooted tree, in which glycoproteins were acquired after divergent of paramyxoviruses from rhabdovirus and bornaviruses (Fig. 4B). VFP are highly divergent at the primary sequence level. Therefore, definitive statistical analyses of these possibilities are not possible at this time. The evolutionary origins of VFP, which display many common structural features, offer worthy challenges to computational biologists.",

Fuzeon\u2122 (DP178; T20 enfuvirtide), one of these peptides corresponding to a portion of the carboxyl terminal helix and the pre-anchor domain in this class I VFP, has been shown to substantially reduce HIV-1 load in AIDS patients, and is well-established in the treatment of HIV infection in the United States and European Union [48]. Peptide entry inhibitors of viruses with class II VFP have also been developed [49], and have also been described for the class III VFP of herpesviruses (Melnik et al., in preparation). Given that bornaviruses cause a range of infectious neurological syndromes in warm-blooded animals, with high mortality rates, veterinary applications of bornavirus entry inhibitors, should be investigated.

The post fusion secondary structure of VSV G as solved and numbered by Roche and coworkers [30] is depicted with \u03b1-helices as cylinders and \u03b2-sheets as arrows. The \u03b1-helices predicted by PHD In BDV G are indicated similarly. \u03b2-sheets (t) and (u) of VSV G are not present in the protein data base structure (2cmz.pdb). In VSV G, \u03b1-helices predicted by PHD are indicated by dashed boxes and predicted \u03b2-sheets are identified with dashed arrows. Amino acids are numbered beginning after the putative signal sequences enclosed in parentheses. Plum amino acids: N-glycosylation sites. Sequences with significant WWIHS scores in the fusion domain (II) were identified by MPeX and colored red. Hydrophobic transmembrane domains (violet) were predicted using TMpred. A class III domain nomenclature is used here that can apply to both class II and III VFP: domain I (green), domain II (yellow), domain III (blue), and stem domain (indigo). This unified nomenclature assigns domain II (IV in the VSV G nomenclature of Roche et al. [30], I in the HSV-1 gB nomenclature of Heldwein et al. [32] and Ia and Ib in the baculovirus nomenclature of Kadlec et al. [34]) as the class III fusion domain as in class II VFPs. In addition to minor adjustments in the ends of domains, the current class III VFP numbering also combines two interacting domains into domain III (I + II in Roche's VSV G nomenclature, III + IV in Heldwein's HSV-1 gB nomenclature and Kadlec's baculovirus nomenclature). The domain numbering originally proposed is also indicated. UA represents \"hinge\" aa not assigned to domains in VSV G in the prior scheme.",
