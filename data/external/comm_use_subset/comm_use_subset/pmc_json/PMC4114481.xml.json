In every crisis, communication between the general population and government is the key to enhance survival and reduce harm. This is especially so given the unpredictable nature of the crisis, and when the impact resulting from the crisis is significant [1]. Citizens who are being implicated by the crisis are naturally highly aroused and stressed. Thus, public health organizations have an obligation to keep the general population adequately informed of the latest information, and to provide them with necessary advice based on the changes in the situation [2].",

Studies on a cohort of Americans identified that the most trustworthy source of information during a crisis came from the doctors [3]. Studies conducted on people in Southeast Asia or Malaysia during the recent H1N1 influenza crisis identified that newspaper, television, and family members were the most trustworthy sources of information [4]. In comparison, similar studies done in the European population, like the Dutch, identified that the most trustworthy source of information came from the mass media during an outbreak of respiratory infectious disease [5,6]. During the 2011 Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) outbreak in Germany, the usage of a Web-based medium as a modality of communication of critical information was reported [7]. The study identified the Internet to be the most popular medium for dissemination of EHEC-related information, with news and newspaper websites as the most often consulted Web-based sources. Participants were noted to be skeptical of information posted on social networking sites and media like Facebook and Twitter [7], but this finding was preliminary due to small sample size (n=18 students).",

The estimated economic loss caused by the 1997 haze crisis was estimated to be US $9 billion. In consideration of the massive impact of haze disaster, the ASEAN Haze Technical Task Force was established to implement regional and National Haze Action Plans, as well as strict no-burn policy in ASEAN countries. Despite efforts being taken to avoid future haze disaster, there was a recurrence in 2006.  Economists estimated that Singapore lost at least US $50 million during the 2006 haze crisis. Industries like construction (7% of GDP) and tourism (3% of GDP) were severely affected. In addition, the losses were attributed to increase in health care costs, as well as reduction in productivity as a result of sick leave and inefficiency.",

In view of the poor air quality, the Singapore government has taken measures to safeguard the physical wellbeing of Singaporeans [8]. Even in healthy individuals, the haze may cause medical complications like conjunctivitis, throat irritation, rhinitis, blocked nasal passages, excessive sputum production, and even significant breathlessness, headache, and slow cognition. In addition, those who have preexisting respiratory conditions may find their conditions worsening; those with dermatological conditions like eczema might also find exacerbation of their skin conditions; those with preexisting cardiovascular conditions may suffer an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke; and those who are pregnant and are asthmatic may have reduced oxygenation of the fetus, thus affecting fetal growth [8]. The acute onset of such a massive air pollution crisis was what motivated the authors to consider whether conventional technologies, as described in previous research, and newer modalities of technology would be appropriate in reaching out to the general population, in terms of dissemination of necessary crisis information, as well as collation of crucial information from the general population.",

The recent developments in Web-based technologies such as Facebook and Twitter, have offered government and nongovernment organizations with new means of disseminating vital information. These new technological modalities have the potential to acquire information and feedback from the general population during a crisis as well, which is important in assessing how the population is coping and responding thus far to the crisis. In particular, Keim and Noji [9] stated that the usage of social media initially started out during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, where various technological modalities such as text messaging, Facebook, and other social media were used in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. Text messages were used as a means to gather donations and funds for relief work. Other technological modalities were used to disseminate information, gather donations, and also provide psychological support.  Previous research has also been done using Facebook technologies to compare the levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms that individuals experienced during the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster [10]. These allow the government and relevant agencies to closely monitor the current situation at the ground level and adjust the level of support accordingly [11]. Information acquired from the general population includes physical and physiological symptoms, as well as detecting new cluster of outbreaks of infectious diseases [11].",

The Web-based questionnaire being featured was coded using a website (Polldaddy). This Web-based database development software was specially chosen, as it is one of the most robust platforms on the market that enables the capture of detailed information, such as the mechanisms of accessing the database (whether via a direct link or from a mobile device) and other pertinent information that is relevant to our current study. The demographics questionnaire comprised of seven items in total, and was used to acquire the baseline characteristics of the participants in the study, such as gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, level of education, occupation, and most importantly, presence or absence of chronic medical illnesses. The questionnaire on physical symptoms assessed the presence or absence of the following physical symptoms: mental slowing, headache, dizziness, eye discomfort, nose discomfort, mouth and throat discomfort, breathing difficulty, heart or chest pain, nausea and vomiting, gastric or abdominal discomfort, slowness in movement, and muscle ache or pain. The participants rated on the range of self-perceived dangerous Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) values, personal possession and perceived usefulness of the N-95 mask on 5-point Likert scales.  The IES-R is a 22-item, self-administered questionnaire that has been well validated for determining extent of stress reaction after exposure to stressful circumstances within 1 week of exposure across different cultural groups. Each item on the scale was administered via a 5-point frequency scale (0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely) and higher scores indicate higher level of psychological stress. The IES-R provides three subscores, the mean avoidance, intrusion, and hyperarousal scores, a total mean IES-R score (divided by the total number of items) and a total IES-R score (without division by the total number of items). A total IES-R score greater than or equal to 33 signifies the likely presence of post-traumatic stress disorder.",

This study was methodologically feasible and demonstrated the usefulness of social medial and a smartphone-based application during a severe air-pollution crisis, which necessitated individuals to stay indoors, and helped to reduce the barriers pertaining to recruitment. Multiple social activities and events were curtailed, and the general public had to engage in other home-based activities. Engaging in Web-based social networking activities was a popular option. Our current findings showed that more individuals preferred the option of accessing and providing feedback to a questionnaire on physical and psychological well-being by direct Internet Web-link access, as compared with indirect access via Facebook or even a smartphone application. Our results did show, that for our current study, demographic variables such as gender, level of education, and age did not significantly affect the mechanism of access.

A total IES-R score of 33 or more signifies the likely presence of post-traumatic stress disorder [14]. Our results suggest that the haze did not cause post-traumatic stress disorder in the general population, but it caused mild to moderate psychological impact. Intrusive symptoms such as recurrent thoughts and feelings were more common than hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms in our study population.  The local government played a key role in reducing the psychological impact. On June 21, the local government took immediate measures to protect its citizens, including hourly updates of the PSI value on television, cancellation of all school activities, offering medical subsidies to treat physical discomfort associated with haze, and providing 1 million free N-95 masks to the needy households [15].

Our findings were similar to a study reported by Lee et al [16] on the psychological responses of pregnant women during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. Lee et al [16] reported that anticipatory worries were common among the pregnant women during the SARS outbreak; overestimation of risk led to higher level of anxiety and the levels of depression were similar between the SARS and pre-SARS outbreak cohorts. In our study, the inverse association between the perceived dangerous PSI values and mean scores of intrusion, hyperarousal, and overall psychological impact suggest that people who have lower threshold for health hazard are vulnerable to greater psychological impact when air quality deteriorates. The low threshold for health hazard and the number of physical symptoms independently determine psychological impact and these factors may contribute to the anticipatory anxiety. Our study did not find a difference in the levels of psychological impact between respondents who filled the questionnaire out during the periods with low and high PSI values. Lee et al [16] found that people tended to receive more social support during the SARS outbreak. We did not measure social support in our study but it may be possible that people would receive more social support from their families during the haze outbreak, as they tend to stay at home or participate in indoor activities with families.",

Also, unlike that of other disasters, there was no large-scale consequential aftermath after the crisis, and most individuals were able to get back to normal life immediately, which is also a major limiting factor in our research.  In addition, our study has an inherent cohort bias, as the study population consisted of younger and educated individuals, recruited by snowball sampling, which is a nonrandom sampling method. Hence, even though we have identified the preferences of our respondents, the observation cannot be generalized to other populations. Nevertheless, we need to emphasize that we encountered major difficulties with rapid planning of this research, recruiting participants, and gathering data over such a short period of time with uncertainty.

Traditional face-to-face interviews come to a halt when people have to be quarantined to avoid spread of infection or staying at home to avoid adverse physical environment. The Internet allows researchers to overcome such barriers. This study compared conventional Web-based methods of acquiring data against the newer methods, including the social networking sites and smartphone applications. Previous studies were limited to comparison of technologies in relation to dissemination of information.  Our results demonstrated that the newer technological modalities have the potential to acquire data as efficiently as conventional technologies, and demographic variables did not influence the mechanism of access during a crisis situation.
