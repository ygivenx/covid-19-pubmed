HuNoV are members of the Caliciviridae family, which have a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome and can cause a variety of disease manifestations in a wide range of species. The Norovirus genus itself is divided into at least six different genogroups based on capsid sequences (2, 3). HuNoV strains fall into genogroups I, II, and IV (GI, GII, and GIV). GII strains are responsible for 96% of HuNoV cases worldwide, with GII.4 genotypes being the most prevalent overall (4). In humans, HuNoV typically causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, with the illness lasting on average 28 to 60 h (5). Infection is most common in health care institutions such as hospitals and long-term-care facilities (6), but outbreaks are often reported in association with schools, restaurants, cruise ships, and other settings such as military bases (7).",

Zoonotic transmission of HuNoV has also been proposed as a hypothetical route of infection (9). Both cattle and pigs have come under scrutiny for their potential role in transmitting HuNoV over the past decade. This has been precipitated by the identification of GII.4 HuNoV RNA in the stools of farmed pigs and cattle (10, 11). Furthermore, over half of the pigs in a U.S. report were seropositive to both GI and GII human noroviruses (12). This finding was supported by a study that demonstrated that human strains can replicate and induce an immune response in gnotobiotic pigs (13).",

Just prior to development of clinical symptoms in humans, the owner's dog was sick on multiple occasions around the home. Serological testing of the dog later revealed a moderate titer to HuNoV antigen by electron microscopy, whereas control dogs were all seronegative. Later evidence linking dogs with HuNoV infections in humans followed in an epidemiological study that showed that seropositivity to HuNoV in humans was higher if there was a dog in the household (15), and anti-HuNoV antibodies have recently been identified in dogs across Europe (16).",

As well as being expressed on erythrocytes, HBGAs are expressed on the surface of epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts and can be secreted by these cells into bodily fluids, including saliva (19). Internalization of viral particles into cells occurs following HuNoV attachment to HBGAs in vitro, and therefore it has been proposed that the primary step for HuNoV uptake into cells is HuNoV binding to the HBGAs. The importance of HBGA binding in human infections has been demonstrated by experimental challenge studies. These have shown that susceptibility to HuNoV infection is related to expression of HBGAs in the gastrointestinal tract (20, 21). Approximately 20% of Caucasians do not express gastrointestinal HBGAs due to the lack of a functional fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) gene (\u201cnonsecretors\u201d), and consequently these individuals have a significantly reduced susceptibility to infection with noroviruses.",

It was suspected that reactivity to vesivirus 2117 could be due to cross-reactivity with the related canine calicivirus, but no correlation between seropositivity to HuNoV or seropositivity to vesivirus 2117 was shown (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Subsequently, the background signal for each sample was determined by measuring the OD450 of serum samples incubated with carbonate-bicarbonate buffer alone. The background signal was then subtracted from the OD450 of VLP-coated wells to generate the corrected OD450 value. A threshold value was established as the mean of the OD450s of all buffer-coated cells plus 3 standard deviations. A serum sample was considered positive when the corrected OD450 was higher than the threshold. Any serum samples showing a positive response to pooled HuNoV VLPs were subjected to further testing with individual HuNoV VLPs.

Individual variation between the samples was identified; for example, canine samples D, E, and F showed decreased binding to GI.2 and GII.4 HuNoV VLPs. Other dogs however, most notably dogs B and C, were able to bind to all HuNoV VLPs tested. This was not apparently related to HBGA phenotype; all dogs were H antigen positive, and dogs C and E were A antigen positive, whereas dogs A, B, D, and F were A antigen negative (as previously reported [23]). In addition, dogs were phenotyped for Lewis antigen, with dogs A and B being Lewis positive and the remainder Lewis negative (data not shown). Variation in OD450 scales between genotypes was arbitrary due to the primary antibody used; for detection of the GI VLPs, the primary antibody used had been raised against GI.1, whereas for the GII VLPs, the primary antibody was raised against GII.4.",

As polymorphism for the A antigen is present in dogs (approximately 50% are A antigen positive [23]) and due to the known interaction between A antigen and HuNoV (32), HBGA phenotyping was also required. Confirmation of the presence or absence of H antigen and A antigen in the tissue sections used for the VLP binding was achieved by incubating the tissue sections with Ulex and anti-A antigen antibody, respectively, and IHC was performed. This demonstrated that dog C was A antigen positive and dog B was A antigen negative, hence enabling comparison of HuNoV VLP binding to canine samples representing the two major HBGA phenotypes. H antigen expression was not detectable in the A-positive dog, which is understood to be due to the ability of the A antigen to mask the H antigen, therefore preventing detection by Ulex lectin binding (33).",

It is acknowledged that immunological cross-reactivity does exist between norovirus genotypes (34), and thus conclusive identification of the primary genotype inducing antibody production was not the aim of these experiments. However, the genotype to which the highest OD450 value was induced in ELISAs was tentatively suggested to be the major HuNoV genotype involved.

Seven different canine serum samples (i to vii) identified as being positive for anti-GII antibodies were analyzed, and serum S (negative for GII binding) was added as a negative control. For samples i to vii, the type of VLP inducing the lowest EC50 for blocking GII VLP recognition by canine serum was GII HuNoV VLPs. CNV VLPs did induce a decrease in GII recognition below the upper threshold of detection in 4/7 cases, but a greater concentration of CNV VLPs than of GII VLPs was required.

HBGAs are expressed on epithelial cells of many species, and we have recently confirmed that this includes dogs (23). This finding led us to hypothesize that HuNoV would be able to bind to the gastrointestinal tracts of dogs, and the ELISA and IHC data presented in this report were able to confirm this. This demonstrates that the initial step required for HuNoV entry into canine cells is present. However, it should be noted that rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RDHV), a related but distinct member of the Caliciviridae family, can bind to HBGAs (H type 2, A antigen and B antigen) (35), and yet there is no evidence RHDV can infect any species other than wild and domestic rabbits of the Oryctolagus cuniculus species. HBGA binding may be an initial step in calicivirus-host interaction, but a subsequent host-restrictive step(s) must be necessary for RHDV infection and potentially for HuNoV infection in dogs.",

This implies that the incidence of HuNoV shedding by this population of dogs is negligible, despite samples being collected from healthy dogs (117 animals), dogs with nongastroenteric disease (64 animals), and dogs with severe gastroenteritis requiring veterinary attention (67 animals). Inclusion of samples from the latter two groups was essential, as it has been suggested that HuNoV may be more likely to infect dogs with underlying disease or immunodeficiency (17), and as canine-specific noroviruses are associated with gastroenteritis in dogs (3, 36), it was hypothesized that HuNoV infection of dogs may cause signs of gastroenteric disease. Gastroenteritis is a common condition in dogs, with an owner questionnaire reporting diarrhea in 14.9% of dogs within the previous 2-week period (37) and 6% of canine veterinary consultations addressing gastroenteritis as a primary complaint (38). Of the 67 dogs with gastroenteritis in our survey, CPV (10 dogs) and CECoV (2 dogs) were detected in 17.9%. This proves that while viral gastroenteritis is relatively common in dogs, noroviruses are not a major cause of viral disease in the population of dogs sampled. The likelihood of HuNoV infection in a dog resulting in clinical signs of gastroenteritis is clearly much lower than that of CPV and CECoV infection, and as such, there is no immediate cause for concern by owners and veterinarians.",

However, their sampling strategy was significantly different from our approach; canine stool samples were collected only if the owner had shown symptoms of gastroenteritis within the past week, whereas stool samples in this study were collected with no reference to recent owner illness. HuNoV in humans is typically an acute infection, with peak viral shedding occurring 2 to 4 days after infection. By 3 weeks after infection, only 25% cases are still positive for viral RNA (39). In addition, although HuNoV is responsible for millions of infections worldwide each year, the virus is only identified in approximately 18% of human diarrheic samples submitted (40). Detection of HuNoV RNA in feces can be limited by factors such as low virus concentrations, improper storage of samples, inefficient viral RNA extraction, and the presence of fecal reverse transcriptase inhibitors (41). Overall, this indicates that positive identification of HuNoV shedding in dogs will be possible only within a very narrow time frame and that a proportion of cases will be false negatives. This suggests that in order to confirm that HuNoV can be shed in canine stools and to determine an accurate prevalence rate, a much larger sample size and/or a more focused sampling approach, e.g., collection of stool samples from owners with confirmed HuNoV infection, will be required.",

We have demonstrated that almost 20% of dogs sampled in 2012 to 2013 had antibodies that could recognize HuNoV VLPs. This suggests that 1 in 5 dogs has been exposed to HuNoV in the United Kingdom. This proportion was lower than the proportion of dogs (43%) reported to be seropositive to HuNoV by a recent survey across Europe (16), which may be a reflection of population differences. An important conclusion from both studies is that the HuNoV seroprevalence rate identified in dogs is substantially lower than HuNoV seropositivity among human populations. In the United Kingdom nearly 100% of people are seropositive for GII.4 (42). This indicates that either dogs are exposed much more rarely to HuNoV or they are much less susceptible to infection than humans. Given that in one questionnaire-based study, 96% of dogs slept in their owners' houses and that when owners are at home almost 60% dogs were allowed anywhere in the house (43), it seems unlikely that dogs would not be exposed to HuNoV in a household with infected humans. Therefore, we propose that dogs are susceptible to HuNoV but at a much lower level than humans.",

For example, anti-CNV antibodies were detected in 45.2% of serum samples used in this study (28). To investigate this further, a series of blocking assays were performed using canine serum samples and serum samples from rats inoculated with CNV VLPs. These were able to show that the anti-GII HuNoV antibodies were specific for GII HuNoV VLPs and not three different strains of CNV (GIV and GVI). It is acknowledged that there are other nonhuman and noncanine noroviruses to which dogs may have been exposed, for example, swine, bovine, and feline noroviruses, cross-reactivity to which was not assessed. However, cross-reactivity between genogroups is known to be limited (34), and thus antibodies specific for feline noroviruses (GIV.2 genotype, the same as certain canine noroviruses) (44) or bovine noroviruses (GIII) are highly unlikely to cross-react with GII human noroviruses. Swine noroviruses, however, are classified into GII alongside human strains (45), and thus there is a greater risk of cross-reactivity. Nevertheless, due to United Kingdom farming practices, the frequency with which dogs in the study population would come into contact with pigs was deemed to be significantly lower than the frequency of contact with humans. In addition, although the feeding of raw pork to dogs does infrequently occur, animal noroviruses are extremely unlikely to be found in commercial pet food due to United Kingdom manufacturing processes and regulations (46).",

First, it is unknown whether HuNoV infection has the potential to cause clinical disease in dogs. To answer this definitively, experimental studies will be required. Second, assuming that dogs can become infected with HuNoV, it is unknown whether dogs will shed virus in their stools in sufficient quantities to infect humans. It has been estimated that as few as 18 HuNoV particles may be sufficient to cause infection in humans (48), so it is likely that very low levels of shedding will be infectious. However, differences in the physiology of the canine and human gastrointestinal tracts (e.g., pH [49]) mean that it is possible that particle infectivity varies between the species. A third unanswered question is whether dogs play a significant role in the epidemiology of certain HuNoV outbreaks. The majority of HuNoV outbreaks do not occur in places where dogs are commonly found, e.g., outbreaks on cruise ships or in hospitals, but a role for dogs perpetuating outbreaks in communities cannot be ruled out. A final question is whether there is potential for dogs to be coinfected with CNV and HuNoV simultaneously. There is also concern than CNV may be zoonotic based on serological and receptor studies (23, 50); hence, CNV/HuNoV coinfections may also be possible in humans. If coinfections can occur, there would be a theoretical risk for recombination between virus strains, leading to generation of a novel norovirus. This may have altered virulence in canine and human hosts, and ongoing surveillance for such recombinants is deemed important.",

(A) A representative CNV-positive canine serum was preincubated with serial dilutions of either pooled GI or GII HuNoV VLPs or pooled CNV VLPs, following the methodology previously presented (28). (B) Seven different GII.4 HuNoV-positive canine serum samples were preincubated with serial dilutions of either pooled GI or GII HuNoV VLPs or pooled CNV VLPs. The concentration of VLP required to block 50% binding (EC50) was calculated by fitting sigmoidal curves to the serial dilution data to allow comparison between serum samples. The dashed line represents the upper limit of detection. (C) An antibody competition assay was performed using antibodies specifically raised against CNV (rat) and GII.4 HuNoV (rabbit). Anti-CNV and anti-GII.4 antibodies were preincubated with GII.4 VLPs on a microtiter plate, and then after three plate washes, GII.4-positive canine serum was added and the OD450 of this interaction determined.",
