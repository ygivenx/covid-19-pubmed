In addition, glial cells are key participators during pathological changes within the diseased brain [7-10]. Both microglia and astrocytes can be rapidly activated through mechanisms like pattern recognition receptors detecting infectious and endogenous danger signals [7,11-16]. In response, activated microglia and astrocytes produce inflammatory mediators like cytokines and chemokines, which critically modulate the course of CNS diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of glial activation is crucial to understanding the pathophysiology of the CNS.",

The corresponding chemokine receptor CXCR3 can be differentially activated by the chemokine ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 [31-35]. CXCR3 mediates distinct functions like integrin activation, cytoskeletal changes, suppression of angiogenesis or chemotactic migration [31,36-39]. Activated T cells and NK cells are well established to express CXCR3 at high levels [40]. Moreover, recent data argue for the functional existence of CXCR3 on microglia [23,41,42] and astrocytes [41,43]. CXCR3 signaling has been mostly investigated during infectious, bacterial and autoimmune diseases of the CNS [18,24,44-52] where immune cells infiltrate the CNS. However, the impact of CXCR3 on glial function without a significant influx of immune cells is not well characterized and only addressed by a few studies [23,53].",

Cuprizone was mixed into a powdered ground standard rodent chow. Before cuprizone administration, all mice of the study were adapted to powdered normal chow for one week. Cuprizone diet was then maintained for five weeks following four additional days on normal chow, representing the stage of CNS-remyelination. As a marker for the clinical outcome of cuprizone administration, the body weight of all mice was monitored twice a week. A total of 4 to 5 WT and CXCR3-/- mice were analyzed at each of the four time points of the experiment (0, 3, 5, and 5 weeks + 4 additional days normal chow/ 5.5 weeks).

After centrifugation, homogenates were dissolved in 75% Percoll (GE-healthcare). Subsequently, the homogenate was layered over with 25% Percoll and PBS. After centrifugation at 800xg for 25 minutes/4\u00b0C microglia were collected from the 25%/75% interface. For surface marker staining, the collected cells were washed in PBS, and blocked with CD16/CD32 (Fc block; eBioscience) antibody. Isolated cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (eBioscience) to detect CD3e (PerCP-Cy5.5), CD11b (APC), CD11c (PE-Cy7), CD45 (FITC), CD45 (eFluor 450), Ly6G (PerCP-Cy5.5), B220 (APC-eFluor 780) and NK1.1 (PE-Cy7). After washing, bound antibody was detected using a BD FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed using the flow cytometry software, FlowJo (TreeStar). Microglia were gated using forward and side scatter characteristics and identified by labelling with CD11b and CD45 according to their typical expression profile. CD11b+/CD45dim microglia populations were further analyzed for the mean fluorescence intensity of CD11b and CD45. The percentage of CD11b+/CD45high cells was expressed in comparison to CD11b+CD45dim+high cells in the corresponding sample.",

Here, we examined the impact of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on glial activation in cuprizone-induced demyelination as a prototypical model for an endogenous activation of both microglia and astrocytes without a major influx of hematogenous immune cells like lymphocytes or monocytes [56,59].

We characterized microglial activation by lectin histochemistry and found differences in microglial activation for all examined brain regions. The differences in areas like the cerebellum or the thalamus were striking and highly significant. Notably, the effect of CXCR3 on microglial accumulation and glial activation was less prominent in the corpus callosum, although cuprizone-induced myelination is most distinct in this area. These regional differences of the effect of CXCR3-deficiency might be explained with the different state of demyelination in these areas. Very extensive demyelination as observed in the corpus callosum could lead to a maximal microglial activation, which cannot be attenuated by the loss of one modulating factor like CXCR3. Still, these findings demonstrate the potent effect of CXCR3 on glial activation in the examined model. The differences in microglial activation were further substantiated by co-localization of the microglial activation marker CD68, which was much lower expressed in microglia from CXCR3-deficient mice, and by flow cytometry. Here, we found most prominent differences in CD45 and CD11b after three weeks of cuprizone feeding.",

GFAP staining and analysis of GFAP+ cells revealed that GFAP+ astrocytes were less frequent and less activated by morphological criteria in CXCR3-deficient mice. However, we cannot discriminate if this observation is directly induced by CXCR3 deficiency or the consequence of reduced microglial activation. Skripuletz et al. demonstrated in a recent study that a lack of astrocytes during cuprizone feeding results in less demyelination and less microglial activation and found evidence that this effect is mediated by a lack of astrocytic CXCL10 [63]. In regard to our study, we cannot exclude that the changes in microglial activation we observe are at least partly caused by a reduced synthesis of CXCL10 by CXCR3-deficient astrocytes. However, a study examining the effect of chronic expression of cerebral CXCL10 could not detect an impact of CXCL10 on microglial activation [64]. As astrocytes and microglia intimately interact and both carry the CXCR3 receptor, it is likely that the lack of CXCR3 on microglia and astrocytes has a synergistic effect on the activation of the cell types [65].",

Corresponding to the activation time-course revealed by flow cytometry, we found a striking attenuation of all inflammatory molecules examined. This was most prominent for prototypical proinflammatory cytokines like TNF\u03b1 or the chemokine CCL2. Interestingly, the RNA levels of the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 were drastically reduced and comparable to untreated controls in CXCR3-deficient mice. This might argue for an auto- or paracrine loop in which CXCR3-activation increases the production of CXCR3 ligands in glial cells.",

Despite the striking changes in the glial activation and cytokine expression, we could not detect a significant change in the course of de- and remyelination. Neither histological evaluation nor the course of the molecular markers Mbp, Plp1 or Cnp revealed differences of de- and remyelination between CXCR3-competent and CXCR3-deficient mice. Although there is some evidence that oligodendrocytes express a functional CXCR3 receptor [66,67], the lack of differences in demyelination argues strongly against a direct modulatory effect of CXCR3 on the extent of oligodendrocyte damage in this model. During remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination, oligodendrocyte precursor cells become recruited, proliferate and have to undergo maturation [68,69]. Although we did not analyze the oligodendrocyte population in extent, we could not observe differences in the increase of myelin-related RNA levels after cessation of cuprizone feeding, nor in the amount of remyelination. This argues, like discussed for demyelination, against a function of CXCR3 in remyelination after cuprizone demyelination.",
