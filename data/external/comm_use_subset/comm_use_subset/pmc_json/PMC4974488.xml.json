In such regimes, the use of the adenoviral prime appeared to overcome the need to formulate the boosting immunogen with a potent adjuvant to reach very high postboost Ab titers; in other words, regimes using an adenovirus prime followed by a boost using recombinant protein in an adjuvant conventionally regarded as relatively weak were capable of inducing Ab titers which matched those induced by the most potent protein/adjuvant regimes (8, 11). These studies did not address the mechanism by which this effect was achieved.",

Dramatically different transgene (Ag) expression kinetics have been demonstrated after immunization with replication-deficient adenovirus and poxvirus vectors, with the former achieving high levels of Ag expression for >10 d, whereas MVA induces a brief high-level burst of Ag expression that appears beneficial for CTL induction but may not achieve sufficient levels of free Ag for optimal humoral responses (12, 13). Elegant studies have delineated a number of pathways of innate immune activation that contribute to the immunogenicity of adenovirus vectors, with roles for TLR9-mediated plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation, TLR2-driven NF-\u03baB activation, and TLR-independent activation of type I IFN driving signaling to both B and CD4+ T cells (14\u201317).",

There is, to our knowledge, little data comparing viral vector vaccines versus protein/adjuvant vaccines for their ability to induce GC B cell and Tfh responses (20). Such comparisons are hindered by the fact that, in contrast to protein-only immunization, a proportion of the total immune response to viral vector vaccination is directed against structural components of the vector rather than toward the desired target (the Ag expressed from the inserted transgene). In this study, we made use of flow cytometric assays designed to identify Ag-specific GC B cells and Tfh cells to compare the induction of these cell populations by a variety of viral vector and protein/adjuvant vaccine platforms.",

There are a variety of differences between and within adenovirus species: as a member of adenovirus species C, AdHu5 is similar both at the sequence level and in terms of immunogenicity to clinically used adenovirus serotypes such as ChAd3, PanAd3, and human adenovirus serotype 6 (21). Throughout, we used a dose of 1 \u00d7 108 infectious units for human adenovirus serotype 5 expressing OVA (AdHu5-OVA); for the virus preparation used, this corresponded to 4.3 \u00d7 109 virus particles.

As an adjuvant for protein vaccines, we first selected alum, which is the most widely used adjuvant in current licensed vaccines. Al(OH)3-based alum adjuvant (Alhydrogel; InvivoGen) was chosen in preference to aluminum phosphate because of previous data demonstrating superior immunogenicity of the former (presumably because of adsorption of the negatively charged OVA protein to the positively charged Al(OH)3); 85 \u03bcg of Al3+ was given per dose, again consistent with our previous work (8). As a second clinically plausible adjuvant, we selected a squalene oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion (Addavax; InvivoGen), dosed according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. Proprietary but similar squalene o/w formulations, such as MF59 (Novartis) and AS03 (GSK), are among the few relatively novel adjuvant formulations, which are currently used in licensed vaccines (34, 35).",

In brief, the OVA transgene included the human tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence and the full-length chicken OVA sequence, with an N311D amino acid substitution. This substitution has previously been reported to prevent N-linked glycosylation at this residue, resulting in expression from mammalian cells of protein with a pattern of glycosylation matching that of hen egg OVA (38). In the AdHu5-OVA vector, the transgene was driven by an intron-containing CMV immediate-early promoter; this promoter (or closely related variants) has been used in the majority of adenoviruses, which have entered clinical trials (39). The empty AdHu5 included the transgene promoter and polyA tail but no Ag-coding sequence. Adenoviral vaccines were grown in HEK293 T-REx cells (Life Technologies), purified by CsCl centrifugation, and titered both by UV spectrophotometry to measure viral particles (per milliliter) and by hexon immunostaining to assess infectious units (per milliliter). Particle:infectious unit ratios were 43 for AdHu5-OVA and 36 for AdHu5-empty. In the MVA-OVA vector, the transgene was driven by the p7.5 promoter inserted at the thymidine kinase locus; this is the most widely used promoter for recombinant poxvirus vaccine vectors (40, 41). MVA vaccines were grown in chicken embryo fibroblasts, purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and titered by fluorescence plaque assay using the GFP marker to measure PFUs (per milliliter). Endotoxin-free chicken OVA and adjuvants were purchased from InvivoGen (Endofit OVA, Addavax and Alhydrogel, which is a colloidal suspension of aluminum hydroxide). Doses used were 1 \u00d7 108 infectious units for AdHu5, 1 \u00d7 107 PFU for MVA, 10 \u03bcg of OVA protein, 25 \u03bcl of Addavax, and 85 \u03bcg of Al3+ in the form of Al(OH)3; the rationale for selection of these doses is explained above. Protein\u2013adjuvant formulations were prepared in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. All vaccinations were diluted in PBS to a total volume of 50 \u03bcl, which was administered i.m., split equally between the gastrocnemius muscles of each hind limb.",

Consistent with our previous data (8), Ag-specific Ab responses primed by AdHu5-OVA were closely comparable to those primed by OVA protein in the potent adjuvant, Addavax, with no significant difference either before or after boost vaccination with OVA in alum. Again consistent with previous experience, responses primed by AdHu5-OVA trended to be slightly higher than those induced by OVA in alum after priming and reached significantly higher levels after boosting. There was also a small but nonetheless statistically significant difference between the responses elicited by priming with OVA in Addavax versus OVA in alum, with the former eliciting higher responses both before and after boost vaccination. In contrast to the responses to AdHu5, we observed that MVA was a relatively weak priming agent, eliciting neither a strong primary Ab response nor a strong recall response upon subsequent encounter with protein Ag.",

Our current data provide further support for the notion that adenovirus vectors are potent inducers of B cell responses, inducing not only IgG responses but also GC B cell and Tfh cell responses, which compare favorably to those induced by leading clinically relevant protein/adjuvant formulations. Our observation of potent Ag-specific GC B cell responses to adenoviruses goes some way toward explaining our previous data, suggesting that priming immunization with a recombinant adenovirus can overcome the requirement for the inclusion of a potent adjuvant with a protein boost to reach optimal postboost Ab titers: the robust GC responses to adenovirus-delivered transgene are likely to result in a substantially expanded Ag-specific memory B cell pool. The magnitude of adenovirus-induced memory B cell responses and the extent of somatic hypermutation\u2014both of which are largely GC-dependent processes\u2014will clearly be worthwhile topics for future investigation.",

In the case of MVA, the non\u2013insert-specific response was dominant to the extent that only a marginal GC B cell response was detectable to the inserted vaccine Ag: possible explanations for this might include a high ratio of viral:transgene protein expression, the transience of Ag expression after MVA immunization, and the induction of dendritic cell apoptosis by MVA (12, 48). Although it has been observed that the ability of vaccinia to achieve Ab-mediated protection against smallpox is encouraging for the use of poxvirus vectored vaccines for Ab induction (6), caution is clearly required regarding their ability to induce responses to soluble secreted inserted Ags in Ag-naive animals. The situation in Ag-experienced animals, in which the available Ag-specific B cell pool will be larger, is likely to be different: in this context, the Ag-specific B cell response to poxvirus vaccination may well constitute a considerably greater proportion of the total response.",

There is clearly scope for further study in this area: notably, comparative analysis of the functional attributes of the Tfh responses elicited by the different regimes would be of interest, as they may differ in the Th1/Th2 bias of the T cell responses they elicit, resulting in a qualitatively different Tfh response (47).",

In view of the fairly substantial variation in lymph node size between animals and regimes, responses are expressed as cells in DLNs per mouse, i.e., from multiplication of the total number of lymphocytes recovered from that animal\u2019s DLNs by the proportion of lymphocytes analyzed by flow which fell within the population of interest. Points represent individual animals (n = 3 per regimen per time point); lines join group means. Horizontal dotted line indicates mean number of cells in two naive animals. Open symbols in (E) represent values calculated from <10 events.",

Mice were culled and DLNs harvested at day 7 after immunization, and responses assessed by flow cytometry using staining panels and gating schemes as shown in Fig. 3. (A) shows total GC B cell responses; (B) shows OVA+ GC B cells; (C) shows total Tfh responses; (D) shows OVA-specific (i.e., OVA-MHC-II tetramer+) Tfh responses. As in Fig. 3, values shown are expressed in terms of calculated number of cells in DLNs per mouse. Each point represents an individual mouse; open symbols on (B) and (D) represent figures calculated from populations comprising <10 events. Each experiment involved six mice per group with the exception of control groups (no Ag/no adjuvant) for which n = 2. Results are pooled from two experiments for which there was no apparent difference in cell recovery, staining intensity or intergroup pattern of responses. Horizontal lines represent geometric means for each group. Dashed horizontal lines indicate the mean size of each population in two age-matched naive mice. After log10 transformation of counts, responses to AdHu5-OVA, MVA-OVA, OVA protein in Addavax, OVA protein in alum [and, in the case of (A) and (C), AdHu5-empty] were compared by ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s posttest for pairwise comparison of individual columns. Selected pairwise comparisons are indicated with bars: *0.01 < p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. NS, p > 0.05.",
