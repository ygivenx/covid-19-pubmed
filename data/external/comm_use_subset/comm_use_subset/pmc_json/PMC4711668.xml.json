            "text": "A variety of hydrolase screening assays is based on non-natural substrates with chromophoric groups. Well-known examples are umbelliferyl-, 4-nitrobenzofurazane- and 4-nitrophenyl-assays [25\u201327]. The disadvantage of this assays is caused by the difference between the properties of the substrate to the non-natural substrate. The most active enzymes in this kind of screening do not have to be the most active enzyme for the natural substrate. As an example, for screening hydrolases, 4-nitrophenyl esters are popular, because standard photometric plate readers can easily monitor the reaction by detection of the colored product at 348 to 405 nm [13]. However, 4-nitrophenyl esters per se are no substrate with industrial pertinence [28, 29]. Furthermore, the absorption of the liberated 4-nitrophenol at 405 nm depends on the pH-value, so that the pH value needs to be controlled. Alternatively, absorbance may be measured at the isosbestic point of 4-nitrophenol at 348 nm [30, 31]. Moreover, 4-nitrophenyl esters are more readily hydrolyzed than esters comprising aliphatic alcohol residues like methanol or ethanol. When 4-nitrophenyl esters are used to in hydrolase screening, the hits may therefore exhibit lower activity towards the actual substrate [19, 32]. In 2008, J. C\u00f3rdova et al. [33] reported enzymatic activity of bovine serum albumin (BSA) showing high hydrolysis rates for 4-nitrophenyl esters at 80\u2013160\u00b0C. Under these conditions, a spontaneous hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl esters is likely, so that the observed hydrolysis may not be necessarily due to an enzymatic activity of BSA. Another argument against the use of 4-nitrophenyl esters is the potential reaction with nucleophilic amino acid side chains as it was shown for the reaction of 4-nitrophenyl acetate with L-tyrosine esters by B.S. Hartley et al. in 1953 and the acetylation of insulin in the reaction with 4-nitrophenyl acetate [34]. Modification of the enzyme by acyl-group transfer may lead to artifacts during screening. Taken together, 4-nitrophenyl esters are are often not suitable as substrate analogues for screening. If possible, alternatives to the fluorophoric and chromophoric non-natural substrates should be used.",

A simple approach are colorimetric pH-assays, which can be employed if one of the products is an acid that subsequently deprotonates or a base that lowers the proton concentration in the medium. This change in pH value can be monitored by an indicator dye [35, 36]. Enzymatically coupled systems that transform one of the products yielding a detectable compound are more complex. As more reaction steps and compounds required for quantification more parameters need to be optimized and the readout is more prone to errors.

One assay relies on the change of the pH-value, the second is based on enzymatic oxidation of the released ethanol to acetic acid and the third, which we expected to be most sensitive, is based on the oxidation of ethanol to ethanal and hydrogen peroxide which is then converted by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in a luminescence reaction. The first assay is the simplest one, because only a buffer- pH indicator system is needed and many examples are established for enzyme screening with pH-indicators [21, 35, 38, 39]. The second assay is also well-known and established for measurements of alcohol in food [40]. This assay was miniaturized to microtiter plates. The third assay is a modification of a chromogenic alcohol-oxidase(AOX)/peroxidase (HRP) ethanol assay for determination of ethanol in beverages, which normally based on 2,2\u2019-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) as chromogenic substrate [41]. This assay was modified to a luminometric assay by adding luminol instead of a chromogenic substrate. The luminometric measurements should be more sensitive due to photons are released by the detection reaction. For the first time the system was established in a flow system with separated bioreactors by Marschall and Gibson [42]. For the quantification of ethanol, we adapted the luminol-AOX-HRP system to microtiter plates by using design of experiments (DoE). The aim was to optimize the system for endpoint measurements of enzymatic hydrolysis reactions. Therefore, for the first time a luminometric AOX-HRP-system was tested for quantification of ethanol in 96-well plates. In this study all assays were tested for HTS compatibility.",

In addition, the assessment of measurement procedures can be based on traditional statistic parameters like signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N), signal to background ratio (S/B), and coefficient of variation (CV) (Table 1). CV is the ratio of mean to variance and often used as quality control for assays [44]. The S/B-ratio is a criterion that indicates whether the level of the signal is sufficiently high above the background. The rule of thumb for a good HTS assay is S/B >3. However, fluctuations in both the signal and the background are not considered. In contrast, the S/N-ratio takes into account the standard deviation of the background. The higher the S/N ratio, the less do background fluctuation influence the desired signal. Both measures indicate whether a sample could be distinguished from the background, however they don\u2019t quantify to what extent the positive and negative controls can be distinguished.",

Pipetting precision and accuracy of aqueous solutions was determined by pipetting on an analytical balance as described by Oelmeier et al., 2010 [57]. A variation coefficient of less than 1.6% was determined for volumes between 20 and 1,000 \u03bcL.

A small amount of carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid in water, which lowers the pH-value as well [72] (Fig 1). We used the pH shift (Fig 1(B)) visualized by the indicator bromothymol blue as a measure of product formation. We choose this indicator due to its expected pH value of the enzyme coupled system consisting of lipase and transaminase. In addition we created a new luminometric assay (Fig 1(C)) for use in 96-well plates. This assays detects the formation of the product ethanol by an enzymatic reaction. Ethanol was oxidized by alcohol-oxidase to yield acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, which is used to oxidize luminol to 3-aminophthalate by horseradish peroxidase (Fig 1(C)). This well-known chemiluminescent reaction is frequently used in immunoassays such as Western Blot or ELISA [73]. For the luminescence-based assay we expected a higher sensitivity as the emitted light can be accumulated (high signal) and there is no stray light from excitation (low background) [74]. Other alcohols can also be oxidized by alcohol oxidase [75] so that this assay would be applicable to the hydrolysis of different types of esters. For comparison we used the commercial ethanol assay from r-Biopharm, based on the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid in a two-step oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase [40]. In this reaction cascade, two equivalents of NADH are generated, which can be detected by UV/Vis spectroscopy at 340 nm. The aim was to identify the best assay out of these three, i.e. the one with the highest dynamic range and most stable readout. The system also has to be sensitive enough to operate reliably with small quantities of substrate and enzymes to save costs in high-throughput screening.",

For comparison of the three HTS assays, endpoint measurements were done. The two step oxidative luminescence assay was optimized by design of experiments (DoE) to maximize the duration of luminescence and the sensitivity for endpoint measurements. The isochronic induction of luminescence in all wells was very important for the reliable quantification of ethanol. The assay mixtures were automatically pipetted by the Tecan evo pipetting robot that can simultaneously pipette 96 wells. It turned out that a pre-incubation time of 15 min without peroxidase was necessary. Without pre-incubation, the resulting luminescence signal was too weak for the quantification of ethanol. Luminescence enhancers like 4-iodophenol [76], were added in order to maximize the luminescence output, however no sufficient signal amplification was observed so that these additives were omitted. Due to the relatively weak signal the luminescence assay was only suitable for endpoint determinations. For quantification, we calculated both the numeric integral and the mean of luminescence over the measured time. A clear luminescence signal was detectable for about 50 min.",

However, upon substrate addition we detected no change in pH-value, so we assume that interactions between the enzyme and the pH-indicator, a polyaromatic molecule, may have interfered with the reaction or its colorimetric detection. Therefore, it was not possible to screen the activity of Amano lipase of Pseudomonas fluorescens(ALFP). Such interfering effects of indicator molecules and enzymes are well known, see for instance Banyai [12, 77]. An alternative option in pH-indicator screening might be the use of 4-nitrophenol (pKa = 7.16) as an indicator molecule. It has only one aromatic ring and is therefore less hydrophobic [77, 78]. None of the other hydrolases showed any change in absorbance with only the pH indicator in the absence of substrate.",

The lipase from Rhizomucor miehei(RML) showed the highest activity of the tested enzymes while the porcine pancreas lipase mix (PPL) showed the lowest hydrolysis activity towards aromatic \u03b2-keto esters. The only esterase in the screening (pNB-Est13), showed the fourth highest activity for all substrates. This shows that esterases may be considered as alternatives to lipases. This is of interest as the activity of lipases depends on hydrophobic surface interactions so that the substrate spectrum is limited. Esterases could help to broaden the substrate range for enzymatic \u03b2-keto acid and \u03b2-amino acid synthesis towards more hydrophilic compounds. Taken together, the assay results confirm, that the pH-assay at 620 nm can indeed be used for substrate-hydrolase screenings, albeit other indicator dyes may have to be tested to reduce non-specific interactions.",

Thus we compared the active site volumes and structural conformations like the opened as well as closed state of RML,Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) and TLL [79]. For example, in water, the lipase active site is covered by a mobile element, the lid, which opens upon substrate binding due to the hydrophobic interface [63]. In contrast to RML and TLL, CRL possesses a large and complex lid (residues 66\u201392), consisting of a short and a long \u03b1-helix. A comparison of the closed and open crystal structure of CRL revealed that the lid has to refold partially (S1b Fig). As expected for this reason, a slower opening and closing when compared to RML and TLL could be shown using Molecular Dynamics [79]. In contrast to CRL, a fast rigid body movement of the lid was suggested for RML and TLL. This opening event is suggested to be the rate limiting step during catalysis [64]. In addition several studies proposed that conformational rearrangement during the catalysis could have a much greater influence on the activity than binding energy inside the substrate pocket [80\u201382]. The discussion on the influence of the dynamic on the activity of the enzyme is still on going [83]. Although CRL possesses a even bigger lid than RML and TLL, the same approximated active site volume was calculated for all three lipases (RML: 59.5 nm3; CRL 60.3 nm3; TLL 57.3 nm3, S1 Fig)",

For this purpose we applied for the first time an alcohol oxidase-peroxidase-luminescence assay for ethanol quantification in 96-well format. Additionally, we evaluated a pH-indicator and a commercial ethanol assay for HTS. We applied several statistical measures for biocatalysis assay evaluation and found that classical Z\u2019-factor, SSMD and t-statistic can indicate whether an assay is suitable for HTS. The pH-indicator assay based on color change of bromothymol blue at 620 nm upon acid formation performed best. However, strictly considered is the most accurate way to evaluate HTS assays to test the complete coupled assays (consisting of: enzyme(s) of interest, substrate(s) and assay compounds), then all necessary assay compounds, substrates and catalysts have to be tested in combination with each other. Otherwise possible cross-interactions of all assay substances can not be excluded when not the complete system is tested. But this approach is not suitable for a screening with the variation of more than one compound, caused by the exponentially growing number of experiments when two or more different compounds are tested. A further obstacle for evaluation of HTS assays by the whole testing system is that the hydrolases have to be previously inactivated in presence of the substrate for an end-point measurement. Moreover, the limiting factors for an evaluation are often enzymes as well as substrates availability (e.g. environmental samples). Therefore, a robust reduced evaluation approach might be suitable and weighed against potential benefits of a complete coupled system. In addition the non-coupled evaluation system could be also adapted for more complex screenings e.g. in case for enzymes from microbial lysates. To accomplish this a standard lysate from the expression host could be included into the evaluation setup. Beside this, using the pH assay in a screen of a panel of mostly commercially available lipases we identified the RML as the most efficient enzyme for the hydrolysis of the tested set of aromatic \u03b2-keto ethyl esters. We were able to explain those findings by structural models of the enzymes\u2019 binding pocket and lid as well as by comparison of our data with descriptive literature on lipases dynamics, including MD.",
