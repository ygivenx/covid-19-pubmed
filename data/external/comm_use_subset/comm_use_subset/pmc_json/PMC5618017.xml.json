Mostly based on phylogenetic clustering, this virus family has been divided into four subgroups: the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u0394-CoV [1,2]. The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an \u03b1-CoV and the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which is characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and loss of weight. PEDV infections have a substantial detrimental effect on the swine industry because they cause high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in sucking piglets [3,4,5]. Since its first identification in Belgium in 1978 in growing and fattening pigs [6], PEDV has been reported in Europe and Asia, and a remarkable increase of PEDV outbreaks occurred in the pig-producing provinces of China in late 2010 [7]. PEDV also emerged for the first time in the United States in early 2013 [5], and spread to Canada and Mexico [8]. These recent outbreaks and the global re-emergence of PEDV have attracted the attention of numerous virologists, representing the necessity for urgent attention and a deeper understanding of PEDV biology and mechanisms of pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Replication is a fundamental event in the lifecycle of viruses, and in the case of positive single-strand RNA viruses and some double-stranded DNA viruses, it occurs in cellular compartments that are generated by specialized viral proteins through the modification of one or more host membranes and/or organelles [9,10,11]. CoV-infected cells also undergo a massive remodeling of intracellular membranes [12]. Upon CoV entry in the host cell and release of their genomic RNA (gRNA) into the cytoplasm, two large polyproteins known as pp1a and pp1b, are synthesized, and their self-processing leads to the generation of 15 to 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) [13,14]. Nsp proteins trigger the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which provide a platform for the concentration of viral factors to very likely guarantee the efficient replication and transcription of CoV gRNA [12,15,16,17,18]. Collectively, the nsp proteins also form replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), which localize on the DMVs and CMs where they mediate the synthesis of viral RNA [15,19,20]. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a byproduct of genomic RNA replication, becomes concentrated in the lumen of the DMVs through a mechanism that remains totally unknown [15]. In contrast, virion assembly takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi complex, and involves the inward budding of the limiting membrane of these compartments, which is triggered by the interaction between the nucleocapsid (N) protein associated with the gRNA, and the structural spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins [13,14]. Complete virions subsequently reach the extracellular environment following the conventional secretory pathway [21].",

            "text": "The first electron microscopy (EM) analyses of CoV-infected cells were carried out in 1960s, and mainly characterized the morphology of the viral particles [16,17,18,22]. Subsequent ultrastructural studies highlighted the DMVs as being a feature of CoV infections, including those of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human CoV NL63 (HCoV-NL63), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [12,15,23,24,25,26]. Over the years, other intracellular structures have been reported to be present in cells infected by CoV in addition to DMVs and virion particles, including CMs, tubular bodies (TBs), vesicle packages (VPs), cubic membrane structures (CMSs), and large viron-containing vacuoles (LVCVs). CMs are reticular inclusions observed in between clusters of DMVs, and are often connected with both DMVs and the ER as revealed by both 2D and 3D ultrastructural studies [15,17]. Like DMVs, MHV- and SARS-CoV-induced CMs are positive for dsRNA and nsp proteins as well, and this finding has led to the postulation that these structures are also involved in viral replication and transcription [12,15,27,28]. In later stages of SARS-CoV infection, groups of single-membrane vesicles surrounded by a common outer membrane, called VPs, arise from the merging of DMVs, viron particles, and possibly CMs [15,27]. LVCVs, which are vacuoles filled with viral particles, have been frequently observed in cells infected with CoV; they are Golgi cisternae that expand to accommodate the increasing assembly of progeny virions over the course of an infection, as they are positive for Golgi marker proteins [12,17,18,22,23,26,27,29,30]. Finally, TBs and CMSs, which have been detected in MHV- and SARS-CoV-infected cells, are condensed, highly organized membrane rearrangements connected to the ER. TBs and CMSs appear to be the result of an aggregation of an overproduced protein because they mostly contain a single structural protein, and therefore they are probably a byproduct of a massive infection with no role in virus replication [12,17,31,32].",

            "text": "Despite its veterinary relevance, the intracellular membrane remodeling induced in host cells by PEDV remains largely unknown. The only infections of \u03b1-CoV characterized at the ultrastructural level so far are those of HCoV-NL36 and of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [23,29,33]. In cells infected with these two \u03b1-CoV, virions were observed in the ER, Golgi, and LVCVs, whereas DMVs were only reported to be present in cells exposed to HCoV-NL36. We thus decided to analyze PEDV-infected cells by quantitative EM and immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) to establish a more comprehensive inventory of the membrane remodeling induced by this virus and in more general by \u03b1-CoV. We opted for a time-course approach to determine at which stage of the viral lifecycle the different membranous structures appear. By combining the ultrastructural data with the measurement of viral RNA synthesis, viral replication, progeny virus release, and immunofluorescence analyses, our results show that PEDV infection induces a profound reorganization of the ER and Golgi, which precedes the formation of DMVs, CMs, and LVCVs. Consistently with these observations, we also found that the ER and Golgi undergo alterations not observed for other CoV, such as ER proliferation and a Golgi vacuolarization, which results in an organelle that we have named the irregular vesicle clusters (IVCs). Importantly, and similar to HCoV-NL36 and TGEV, we also found that together with the Golgi, the ER is the major platform of virion assembly. Altogether, our study provides an overall comprehensive picture of the ultrastructural events taking place inside a cell over the course of a PEDV infection.",

Second, we calculated the percentage of cell sections positive for each PEDV-induced structure. Third, we determined the average number of each structure per cell section and calculated the standard deviation. The average diameter of the length of each structure was determined by measuring 10\u201340 profiles using the ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/), which also calculated the standard deviations. At each p.i. timepoint, the ER surface area per cell was calculated using the point-hit method [42] on 50 randomly selected electron micrographs from three different grids.

These are the characteristic DMVs induced by CoV [12,17,23,24,25]. Numerous DMVs appeared to have inward invaginations of the limiting membrane, which have also previously been observed in specific cell types (Figure 1B, asterisks) [12,15]. In between and around the DMVs, we frequently observed a network of reticular inclusion, which had already been described in MHV- and SARS-CoV-infected cells as the CMs (Figure 1B) [12,15,17].",

Based on their morphology, PEDV particles could be grouped in two categories. The first were particles with an annular stained region under the external envelope (Figure 1C,D,F, black arrows). The second were smaller virions with a less circular and denser core, which was more markedly stained (Figure 1C\u2013E, white arrows). These same phenotypical differences in viral particles have also been observed in TGEV-infected cells, another \u03b1-CoV, for which it was shown that the particles represent immature and mature virions, respectively [29]. PEDV viral particles were mainly present in the lumen of two morphologically distinguishable compartments, where they were assembling through inward budding at the limiting membrane (Figure 1C,D, arrowheads). One of these two compartments was what appeared to be an expanded rough ER with irregular shape, as the surface was decorated with ribosomes and they were often observed to be connected to an ER with normal morphology (Figure 1C). These structures have already been reported in cells infected by other \u03b1-CoV [23,29]. The other compartments were large vacuoles with a diameter of 865 \u00b1 270 nm, limited by a single membrane, which have previously been named LVCVs (Figure 1D) [12,17,18,22,23,26,27,29,30]. Virions were also detected in large single-membrane vacuoles with a diameter of 800 \u00b1 160 nm, which also contained compact membrane whorls and amorphous material (Figure 1E). Similar compartments, but smaller in size and without virions, were also observed in uninfected cells, indicating that they do not represent structures induced by PEDV. These characteristics suggested that these vacuoles could be endolysosomal compartments. This notion was confirmed by the immunogold labeling of cryo-sections obtained from PEDV-infected cells at 72 h p.i. using antibodies against CD63 and the transferrin receptor (TfR). These two marker proteins of the endolysosomal system [44] were present in these virion-containing vacuoles (Figure S1). Altogether, these characteristics indicate that these vacuoles are expanded endolysosomal compartments. Interestingly, both types of virions could be observed in ER and LVCVs, but only the smaller dark mature virions were found in the endolysosomal compartments.",

At 24 h p.i., 2% of the cell sections started to show visible signs of infection, and this percentage gradually increased over time until it reached 84% at 72 h p.i. (Figure 3A).

In particular, the percentage of cell profiles containing a specific structure was determined for each p.i. timepoint (Figure 3B,C). DMVs were one of the first structures to be detected, and they were observed in about 2% of cell sections at 24 h p.i. The number of cell sections positive for these vesicles gradually increased over time, reaching a maximum of 38% at 60 h p.i. (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the localization and morphology of the DMVs changed over the course of the PEDV infection (Figure S2). At early timepoints, i.e., 24 and 36 h p.i., DMVs had always a regular circular shape and they were distributed throughout the cytoplasm in small clusters of less than five DMVs. From 48 h p.i. onwards, DMVs became organized in larger clusters, with 10 or more vesicles, and mostly were found in the perinuclear region of the cell. The DMVs invaginations also became more pronounced from 48 h p.i. CMs were initially detected at 24 h p.i., but only in 0.5% of cells (Figure 3B and Figure S2). They became more apparent at 36 h p.i., reaching a plateau at 60 h p.i. The CMs were always found in between or around the cluster of DMVs. A dramatic change in the percentage of CMs was observed at 60 h p.i., increasing from 6% to 21%, when the DMVs also increased markedly. Overall, these data indicated that the CMs are structures that are functionally connected with DMVs, as previously reported [15].",

During the first 48 h after the inoculum, the number of cell sections displaying this organelle did not change noticeably (Figure 4B). The Golgi complex, however, was practically no more detectable with its known morphology (i.e., a series of adjacent stacks) from 60 h p.i., at the exact same timepoint when the LVCVs became prominent (Figure 4B). Interestingly, the percentage of cell sections with LVCVs at the late p.i. timepoints was similar to those of cell sections with Golgi prior to exposure to PEDV.

In approximately 20\u201350% of the cases, depending on the p.i. timepoint, these structures also appeared to contain a few Golgi-like stacks, and we therefore speculated that they originate from the Golgi complex (Figure S3A,B). Quantification of these structures revealed that they are not abundant, and the number of cell sections displaying them peaked at 24 h p.i. before decreasing (Figure 4D). These structures have not been detected in other CoV infections and therefore they could be specifically induced by PEDV. Alternatively, they could represent Vero E6 cell-specific Golgi complex alterations that take place when those cells are exposed to PEDV. We named those structures irregular vesicle clusters (IVCs).",

We inoculated cells with PEDV (MOI = 1) before analyzing them by immunofluorescence at 0, 24, and 72 h p.i. using antibodies against dsRNA and GM130, a Golgi marker protein. In non-infected cells, GM130-labelled Golgi localized perinuclearly (Figure 4G) [47]. GM130 lost its compact organization in infected cells, recognized by dsRNA staining, and became more scattered throughout the cytoplasm in numerous puncta at 24 h p.i. (Figure 4G). At 72 h p.i., the distribution of the GM130 signal changed again, forming cytoplasmic clusters, but those had a less compact shape compared to the ones observed in uninfected cells. We did not observe a colocalization between dsRNA and GM130 at any timepoint, indicating that the Golgi membranes very likely do not contribute to the establishment of the PEDV replication sites (Figure 4G). When the same samples were labeled with another Golgi protein marker, GIANTIN [48], and one for the trans-Golgi network, TGN46 [48], and analyzed by immunofluorescence, we detected the same reorganization of the Golgi in infected cells as that observed for GM130 (Figure S3C,D).",

The ER proliferation first appeared at 8 h and reached a peak at 24 h p.i., before becoming less prominent during the following hours of infection (Figure 5C). These changes in the ER area were confirmed by estimating the ER surface area using the point-hit method (Figure 5D). Interestingly, the ER proliferation alleviation starting from 24 h p.i. coincided with the emergence of ER-derived structures, such as DMVs, CMs, and virion-positive ER, in the infected cells (Figure 5C). Next, we confirmed that the ERBs as well as the virion-containing compartments seen in Figure 1C originate from ER by immuno-EM analysis using an anti-KDEL antibody (Figure 5E,F and Figure S4). Since the ERBs only appeared from 48 h p.i. and increased gradually afterwards (Figure 5C), this observation suggests that these structures are probably not functionally connected with ER proliferation.",

This type of information is also scarce for \u03b1-CoV in general, as the infection of only two other viruses belonging to this genus, i.e., HCoV-NL36 and TGEV, have been characterized at the ultrastructural level so far [23,29,33]. HCoV-NL36 and TGEV virions have been observed in ER, Golgi, and LVCVs, while DMVs were solely detected in cells exposed to HCoV-NL36. Thus, although those studies have revealed some similarities between the host membrane rearrangements caused by \u03b1-CoV and members of the other CoV genera, a temporal and comprehensive description of all morphological alterations induced in host cells by \u03b1-CoV is still lacking. The limitation in the ultrastructural studies on HCoV-NL36 and TGEV has been the analysis of a single infection timepoint, which makes it difficult to obtain a complete repertoire of induced intracellular structures, because their frequency and morphology change over the course of an infection, as shown for MHV [12]. Therefore, we decided to take a time-course approach to examine PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells by qualitative and quantitative EM. In addition to structures like DMVs and LVCVs, already shown to be induced by \u03b1-CoV, this strategy allowed us to detect structures such as CMs, that have been reported for other CoV, as well as novel structures, such as IVCs and ERBs. It has recently been reported that PEDV triggers autophagy [52], but we did not observe evidence in our samples indicating an induction of this pathway. In particular, we did not detect autophagosomes, which are morphologically different than the observed DMVs. These latter are much smaller (180\u2013280 versus 500\u20131500 nm [53]) and they do present cytoplasmic component in their interior.",

Interestingly, we saw a proliferation of the ER at the early stage of PEDV infection, from 8 h p.i., which peaked at 24 h p.i. just before the appearance of the DMVs and the virion-positive ER (Figure 5C). Considering the functional interrelationship between DMVs and ER [15,45,50], one hypothesis is that the ER proliferates to accommodate the increasing mass of viral proteins that will form the DMVs and luminal virions. Another hypothesis is that one or more PEDV proteins present some structural and/or functional characteristics that lead to a more pronounced ER stress response.",

ERBs have a geometrical organization and are connected with the ER (Figure 1F). Their ER origin is also demonstrated by the fact that they are positive for the ER marker peptide KDEL (Figure 5D,E). These observations render the ERBs reminiscent of the TBs and CMSs induced by MHV and SARS-CoV [12,16,17,31]. TBs and CMSs also appear at the late stage of an infection and contain a single viral protein, which self-aggregates when massively overproduced. As a result, it is tempting to speculate that ERBs also represent aggregates formed by one or more PEDV proteins that are present in the ER in elevated amounts. The morphological differences between ERBs, TBs, and CMSs are probably due to a difference in the structural and self-aggregating properties of the proteins that lead to their formation.",

However, we first detected them forming in both ER and LVCVs at the same timepoint (i.e., 24 h p.i.). This is in contrast with what has been reported for CoV belonging to other subfamilies, i.e., their viral particles assemble in the ERGIC/Golgi compartments [12,56], but also TGEV. The virions of this \u03b1-CoV start to form in the ERGIC/Golgi compartment and only at later timepoint in the ER [29]. The reason behind these differences might be due to differences between genera, viruses, and/or infected cell types. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that PEDV particles assemble in both the ER and Golgi complex. PEDV virions were also detected in what appear to be endolysosomal-like compartments from 36 h p.i., but, intriguingly, we never noted them assembling on the limiting membrane of these organelles. Altogether, these observations lead us to postulate that the endolysosomal compartments are not the site of viral particle assembling, but rather a location where excess virions are nonspecifically delivered, or that could eventually represent a transport for intermediates involved in the secretion of viral particles. Alternatively, the virions observed in the endolysosomal compartments could be secreted viral particles that are re-infecting cells through endocytosis. Very interestingly, we observed two types of virions appearing simultaneously (Figure 1C,D), which have been so far described exclusively in cells exposed to another \u03b1-CoV, TGEV, suggesting that this could be a unique characteristic of this CoV genus [29]. In the morphological study of TGEV-infected cells [29], smaller viral particles with denser cores were identified as mature virions, while larger annular ones were noted as the immature precursors. Our observations suggest that PEDV virion maturation does not occur in a specific organelle, as both types of viral particles were found to be present in the ER and LVCVs (Figure 1C,D), indicating the structural maturation of PEDV virion particles could happen in both the ER and LVCVs. This result is in part dissimilar from that obtained from the study of TGEV, where it was shown that virion maturation mainly takes place in the Golgi [29]. Again, this difference could be specific to the virus or the infected cell type. Another possibility is that some mature virions are retro-transported to the ER after maturation in the Golgi due to their local massive production. Interestingly, we also found that only mature virions are present in the compartments of the endolysosomal system (Figure 1E), further supporting one of our hypotheses made above.",
