CoVs contain the largest known RNA genomes and can be genetically divided into four genera; namely, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [3]. Deltacoronavirus (DCoV) genus was mainly discovered in a variety of avian species and pigs [4,5]. Porcine DCoV (PDCoV) was first detected in pigs during a molecular surveillance of CoVs in mammals and birds in Hong Kong in 2012 [5], while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in 2014 in the United States [6,7,8]. Thereafter, PDCoV was rapidly identified in many countries, including China, Canada, South Korea, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Vietnam [9,10,11,12,13]. PDCoV can cause severe diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration in suckling and nursing piglets, and the clinical symptoms are indistinguishable from those caused by porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [14,15]. PDCoV has caused serious economic losses for the pig industries. However, there are no effective reagents and vaccines to control PDCoV.",

            "text": "The host range of CoVs is expanding from wildlife to humans; generally, mammals are thought to be the host for Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, while avian is considered to be the host for Gammacoronavirus and DCoV [5]. Some CoVs can be transmitted to different animal species, and subsequently adapt to the new host, even to humans. Examples include the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which were transmitted by civet cats and camels, respectively, to humans, and caused great harm to humans [16,17,18]. The novel swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) was also verified to be a bat-related CoV that was 98.48% identical in genome sequence to the bat HKU2-CoV, which originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats as SARS-CoV [19]. However, little was known about the natural reservoir of these CoVs [2,20]. DCoVs have been mainly found in wild birds in early research, but recent findings suggested that DCoVs are also present in mammals [4,21,22,23]. With the detection of PDCoV in pig herds, it was confirmed that PDCoV had a close relation to birds\u2019 DCoV, especially with sparrow CoV HKU17, which suggested there might exist bird-to-mammal transmission of PDCoV [5,24]. Meanwhile, DCoVs were detected previously in some small wild mammals, such as Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers. The S genes of the DCoVs isolated from these mammals were closely related to those of PDCoV identified in pigs, with the nucleotide similarity over 99.8% [5]. On the basis of these findings, we deduce that the potential interspecies transmission of PDCoV may exist between these wild small mammals and pigs, as well as between domestic pigs and birds/avian.

Our data indicated that PDCoV can infect three lines of chicken embryos, including White-feather Broiler, Hyline Layer, and SPF chicken embryos, and PDCoV can be passaged on these chicken embryos. Furthermore, we investigated the susceptibility of chickens to PDCoV infection. The PDCoV-inoculated chickens showed mild diarrhea symptoms; positive PDCoV RNA in feces and multiple organs; and mild histology lesions in the lung, kidney, and intestinal tissues.

The typical histological lesions in cecum were characterized by intestinal crypt cells with diffuse necrosis, lymphoid follicle expansion, and a large amount of lymphocyte infiltration. The obvious lesion in the kidney was characterized by degeneration and necrosis of renal tubular.

There exhibits an obvious tendency for CoVs to engage in cross-species transmission, like the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [26,30]. PDCoV is a novel swine intestine CoV and may have a broad host range [25]. However, it is still unclear whether PDCoV can infect avian species, including chickens and other poultry. In this study, we first inoculated the PDCoV HNZK-02 strain into three kinds of chicken embryos, and then the susceptibility of SPF chickens to PDCoV infection was investigated. Our study demonstrated that PDCoV can infect chicken embryos, and could be passaged on them. Moreover, SPF chickens intragastrically inoculated with the PDCoV strain HNZK-02 to develop a mild infection with persistent PDCoV RNA shedding in tissues and intestinal contents, and also showed mild intestinal lesions and clinical disease. Our results indicated that chickens are susceptible to PDCoV infection, but do not present with clinical signs, which might provide more insight about the cross-species transmission of PDCoV.",

Our data showed that PDCoV could consecutively propagate in these three lines of chicken embryos, and the viral RNAs were detected even after six rounds of passage in the broiler embryos. Meanwhile, the relatively low PDCoV RNA titer also could be detected at some passages of another two kinds of chicken embryos, suggesting that there existed a lower replication of PDCoV in the chicken embryos, possibly because of its incomplete adaptation.

These SPF chickens showed mild diarrhea symptoms and shed PDCoV RNAs in intestinal contents and tissues until 17 dpi, indicating that PDCoV could persistently infect SPF chickens. Furthermore, PDCoV-specific viral RNA was also detected in fecal samples until 6 dpi. Previous reports showed that PDCoV can infect gnotobiotic and conventional piglets, and caused severe atrophic enteritis characterized by severe watery diarrhea and vomiting [22]. However, PDCoV-infected pigs appeared to shed less PDCoV RNA titer in the feces when compared with the inoculated viral titer [21,22], implying a potentially lower replication rate of PDCoV in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs. In addition, a comparable low viral RNA titer was detected from fecal samples of gnotobiotic calves challenged with PDCoV [25], which also suggested that there was a lower replication of PDCoV in the intestine of calves. These findings raise the possibility that PDCoV is susceptible to piglets, calves, and chickens, but it may not yet be completely adapted to these animals. Studies are needed to investigate if the mortality of PDCoV infection in chickens could be increased by serially passaging PDCoV in chickens. ",

In this study, our results indicated that PDCoV viral RNA was mainly detected in chicken lungs; kidneys; and multiple intestinal tissues, including cecum, jejunum, and rectum, implying that there exhibits an extensive tissue tropism during PDCoV infection in chickens.
