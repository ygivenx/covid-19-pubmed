Strengthening emergency preparedness is the primary task of emergency management at the national and local levels [2,3]. However, recent environmental disasters have revealed the limitation of government in real-time response and mobilization to help the public, especially when a disaster strikes a large area at the same time [4]. Public health emergency preparedness is a \u201cbottom-up\u201d system [1], and individuals, families, and communities, industries are essential to increasing the resilience of emergency management [5,6,7]. They are the first respondents coping with disasters before the arriving of support from government. As responding at the first time and the first scene plays important roles on the mitigation of disaster losses, how to strengthen PHEP at the grassroots level, and how to extend public health emergency response mechanisms to communities and even families, is a research question of highly practical significance. In this study, we aim to describe the relationship between media exposure and individual PHEP behaviors.",

Murphy et al. found that watching national news, reading a newspaper, and listening to the radio can positively affect preparedness [11]. Paek et al., found that people who were more exposed to the news were more prepared for various emergencies reported by television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet [9].

Second, by setting and initiating the agenda, a culture of public responsibility and safety can be shaped and security awareness can be heightened [13]. Third, media can expand the boundaries of personal experience to enable the public to become aware of various emerging man-made and natural disasters in the world through reporting on disaster-related news and documentaries [14]; this can be supported by Social Learning Theory [15]. In addition, media can help people learn about relevant government processes, activities, and government\u2019s performance, especially the outcome of the government\u2019s response to improve the public\u2019s sense of transparency, and thus increase their trust in government [16,17].",

DeCremer et al., found that trust in government has been shown to affect a person\u2019s degree of cooperative behavior [24,25]. Lasker found that trust in government can lead a person to become more cooperative with the government in an actual emergency [26]. Based on a survey of 316 drill participants, Allen found that trust-building between local government and community members can promote emergency preparedness [27]. Besides, during public health emergencies, the more the people have knowledge of the nature and evolution of disasters as well as a basic understanding of the government\u2019s response capability and rules, the more the people trust in the government\u2019s capability [16,17].

In 2006, the national government website system was established, from when government information disclosure can be carried out through new media (e.g., Internet, mobile phone customization).

We found that from 2014 to 2016, official public health information disclosure on WeChat and Micro. blog was gradually increasing, while information disclosure on traditional media was steadily decreasing and remaining flat on government websites. Thus, we can predict that WeChat and Micro. blog were gradually supplanting traditional media. Based on this observation, we believe that both traditional and new media played a role in public health information disclosure in Hangzhou, and their purposes are continuously changing, which is representative of all of China. As such, we chose samples from Hangzhou. ",

Supplies (SUP) is one kind of non-cooperative behavior that can be implemented by one individual. Referring to the questionnaires used by Murphy et al. [11] and Paek et al. [9] in order to measure cooperation behaviors, we asked respondents to estimate the frequency of engaging in the following three community interactions on a 5-point Likert-type scale of 1 (never) to 5 (very often): attend emergency skills training, attend emergency drills, and attend emergency volunteer service. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was calculated for the scale (\u03b1 = 0. 91). To measure behaviors regarding emergency supplies, we asked individuals to indicate which of the following three recommended items they owned: drinking water and emergency food for 72 h, a first aid kit, and a cloth face mask. The scores for emergency supplies ranged from 0 (owned none of these) to 3 (owned all of the recommended supplies). Since behaviors of cooperation and emergency supply ownership are two independent dimensions, we measured emergency preparedness behaviors by averaging them after normalization. ",

In addition, the effects of the two types of PHEP were analyzed using the intentionally biased bootstrapping (IBB) model (Figure 5). For the media exposure-cooperation (ME-COOP) behavior scenarios (Scenarios 1 and 3), the most sensitive variable to change with COOP was government trust (GT), followed by knowledge (KN) and ME. On the other hand, ME and emergency supply behaviors (SUP) in Scenarios 2 and 4 showed relatively little change compared to those in ME-COOP. The most sensitive factor to changes in SUP was KN. The impact of GT was found to be relatively minor. New media exposure (NME) appeared to be larger than changes in traditional media exposure (TME). ",

Specifically, frequent exposure to both traditional media and new media can directly promote their ownership of public health supplies behavior. Although the direct effects of the relationship between media exposure and their cooperation behaviors was not significant, knowledge and trust in government mediated the relationship between media exposure and cooperation behaviors. Although different opinions exist related to the effect of media exposure on trust in government, the media malaise thesis indicates that mass media has an adverse effect on trust [40], while the mobilization thesis contends that mass media has a positive effect on trust [41], and the neutral thesis suggests that the relationship between media exposure and political trust is highly dependent on existing conditions [42]. Regardless of which research articles prevail, in the Chinese context, media is always a significant way to strengthen political trust; this positive effect has been empirically verified in our study and other academic research [43]. However, in the cross-scenario analysis, we found that trust in government can play roles in the relationship between media exposure and cooperation behaviors, while it did not play roles in the relationship between media exposure and supplies behaviors. Moreover, new media exposure does not have direct effects on trust in government in the NME-COOP scenario, which means that simple media exposure may not increase individuals\u2019 trust in government, but needs to through the growth in knowledge. Therefore, through the effective combination of new and traditional media platforms, various forms of public safety contents for distributing knowledge of public health emergencies, public health emergency management, and government activities and events should be communicated to the public in a seamless, comprehensive, and real-time manner in order to improve their trust in government.",

To improve PHEP cooperation behaviors, the level of trust in government should be increased, and the government should build good relationships with the community and the public. The executors and planners of emergency and preparedness need to be part of the community. They need to regularly meet, listen to, and become familiar with community representatives and residents. The content of these meetings may be public health information of interest to residents as well as emergency preparedness topics. Knowledge is a significant predictor for both types of PHEP, so disaster-related education programs should be developed and promoted throughout the community. The content and form of programs should be well-designed and based on the particular learning needs of different target groups, such as the \u2018trickle-down\u2019 process of dissemination for children. Community groups can be established for women, and special education can be provided for elderly and disabled people [44].

Due to the advent of new media, the government cannot completely control media, and the new media users maintain a cautious and conservative attitude towards cooperation behaviors. New media exposure cannot directly lead to cooperation but must do so through an understanding and trust in government. Therefore, in order to promote PHEP through new media, simple verbal communication is ineffective, and more useful knowledge and skills should be disseminated. This requires not only the creation and cooperation of new media content providers, but the government also needs to participate in dissemination through new media. In fact, new media is an important way for the government to communicate with the public and build trust in government. Through new media, the government can give more feedback to the public\u2019s inquiries and needs, as well as provide more channels for public participation and help the public to better understand and support the government\u2019s emergency management activities.",

Previous studies have conducted extensive empirical research on this topic; however, there has been relatively little study of the mechanisms with which media exposure impacts PHEP, as well as little consideration of the mediating effects of knowledge and trust in government. In this study, we constructed a model with influence mechanisms and performed an empirical analysis. The study\u2019s hypothesis of serial multiple mediating effects was supported. First, this study confirmed that media exposure could significantly and positively affect knowledge, trust in government, and PHEP. Knowledge had a significant and positive effect on trust in government and PHEP. Trust in government had a significant and positive effect on PHEP. Second, we found that knowledge and trust in government can individually mediate the relationship between media exposure and PHEP. Third, the empirical study also verified that knowledge and trust in government have serial multiple mediating effects on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP. Last, we found that the mediating effects are different among the four scenarios that combined two types of media exposure and two types of PHEP. The effect of media exposure on public health emergency preparedness was considered an important research question. In this study, we divided media exposure into traditional media exposure and new media exposure, and divided public health emergency preparedness into cooperation behavior and supplies. Through the role of knowledge and trust in government as mediators, we constructed a serial multiple mediation model with four scenarios. We suggest that future research could build on the new analysis framework of this study, expand the scope of the samples, and carry out some cross-cultural studies, thus revealing more meaningful conclusions.",
