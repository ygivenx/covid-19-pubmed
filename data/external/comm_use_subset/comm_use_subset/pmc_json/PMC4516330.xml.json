The initiation of these neuroinflammatory responses are often mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as membrane bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as cytoplasmic RNA and DNA sensors [1, 6, 7]. These PRRs are stimulated during infections of the CNS by pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); structural motifs in nucleic acids, lipids or proteins from pathogens that are not commonly found in a eukaryotic cell [8\u201310]. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as nucleic acids from apoptotic cells or secreted micro-RNAs, have also been associated with neurological disease or damage and can also stimulate PRRs, particularly endosomal toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 [11\u201313]. Examining how stimulation of these receptors mediates neuroinflammatory responses is important in determining the mechanisms of pathogenesis for diseases of the CNS.",

Activated astrocytes and microglia are both found in a number of neurological disorders and their activation state often correlates with the severity of disease [1\u20135].

Microglia are derived early during development from immature progenitors in the yolk sac and have an important role in synaptic pruning of neurons in the developing brain [15]. These cells then populate the CNS and persist for the entire life of the organism with only limited turnover from bone-marrow derived monocytes. In the mature CNS, microglia have a ramified morphology and only become amoeboid in shape upon activation. They actively respond to infection or damage in the CNS, phagocytizing microorganisms, dying cells and cellular debris as well as producing inflammatory mediators [8, 9, 15]. In contrast to microglia, astrocytes are neuroectodermal in origin and are responsible for a wide variety of functions in the CNS [2]. For example, they regulate transendothelial cell migration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and contribute to regulation of synaptic activity throughout the brain. Upon activation, astrocytes upregulate expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and undergo process extension and interdigitation. Excessive activation of astrocytes during infection or inflammation can result in astrocyte scarring, leading to long term tissue damage [2, 10, 16\u201318].",

Microarray analysis of unstimulated microglia and astrocytes demonstrated unique transcriptomes of unstimulated cells, with microglia associating more closely with bone marrow monocytes and dendritic cells compared to astrocytes or neurons [19]. However, both microglia and astrocytes are capable of recognizing multiple viral and bacterial infections [10, 20, 21] and secrete high levels of cytokines following activation [5, 20, 22]. Indeed, our previous studies showed similar induction of cytokines following TLR stimulation of astrocytes or microglia [20]. However, a comprehensive analysis of the similarities and differences in the microglial and astrocytic responses to innate immune stimulation would provide a better understanding of the role of these cells in responding to pathogenic insults in the CNS.",

These cellular miRNAs may serve as DAMPs to induce innate immune responses in the CNS, and recent studies have found increased expression of certain miRNAs, such as let-7b, in the CSF of Alzheimer\u2019s patients as well as the release of let-7b from dying neurons [13, 28].

Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the higher ratio of gene expression by microglia, although it did detect gene expression in astrocytes that was not detectable by microarray. Comparison of TLR7 to another endosomal TLR, TLR9, indicated that the increased response by microglia was consistent for both receptors. Analysis of several of the upregulated genes in both cell types revealed potential markers for both microglia and astrocyte activation during viral activation. The findings from these studies provide a better understanding in how TLR activation alters the function of both astrocytes and microglia as well as identifying genes that may be potential markers for glial activation in vivo and in vitro.",

The pathways that scored higher with astrocytes relative to microglia were associated with quantity of immune responses or cell cycle progression (Table 1).

However, this study identified several genes besides these cytokines that are differentially induced in microglia and astrocytes. To better examine the expression of these genes between microglia and astrocytes, we utilized real-time PCR analysis, which is more sensitive in detecting transcript expression relative to microarray analysis [40]. We focused on genes that were induced by TLR activation in a) both cell types, b) microglia alone or c) astrocytes alone and that were upregulated at least two-fold (Table 2). Real-time PCR detection of gene expression was more sensitive than that observed with microarray when calculated as fold change relative to mock stimulated controls. Interestingly, TLR-induced gene expression was more readily detected in both cell populations for all but three of the selected genes (Table 2, second column). Only Ifit1 was not induced by TLR-stimulation of astrocytes, whereas only Elovl7 and Rapgef5 were not upregulated by microglia (Table 2).",

TLR9-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes induced a very similar response to TLR7-induced activation (Fig 5, Table 3). The main differences between TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation was higher mRNA upregulation of Saa3 and Traf1 by TLR7 stimulation and higher mRNA upregulation of Ifit1, Nlrp3, Cd69, BC023105 by TLR9 stimulation in microglia (Fig 5, Table 3).

We utilized two different mouse models of virus infection: a retrovirus (MuLV) infection model, where the primary cells infected are microglia and macrophages and the level of CNS inflammation is minimal, and La Crosse virus (LACV) infection, which results in substantial neuronal cell death and inflammatory infiltrate in the CNS. In both model systems, gliosis is associated with pathogenesis [41, 42]. We analyzed nine genes that were upregulated by TLR stimulation of either microglia and/or astrocytes in both systems. Interestingly, the two genes whose mRNAs were consistently only upregulated in astrocytes, Elovl7 and Rapgef5, were not elevated in brain tissue following either virus infection (Fig 6). Only Ifi202b mRNA was significantly induced in brain tissue from MuLV-infected mice, which correlated with the lower level of inflammation in this model (Fig 6). However, several additional genes including Traf1, AW11202010, Birc3, Gpr84 and BC023105 were upregulated following LACV infection. The upregulation of these genes by TLR stimulation of glial cells in vitro and virus infection in vivo suggests that mRNA expression of these genes may be useful for measuring glial activation in the CNS during virus infections.",

Microglia were found to induce a much broader response than astrocytes following TLR7 activation (Figs 1\u20134). However, some of this difference is likely to be due to the lower basal mRNA expression of many of these genes in astrocytes. Additionally, TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed at higher levels in microglia than in astrocytes [20], which could account for more stimulation in microglial cells and thus the higher overall number of genes induced by TLR stimulation.",

Importantly, all of the genes found to be upregulated in a specific cell type by microarray were also upregulated by real-time PCR (Table 2), although not necessarily with the same fold increase between the two cell types. This indicates that although the level of detection and fold-increase may vary between the two methods, the genes that were detected as upregulated by microarray analysis could be confirmed by real-time PCR analysis. The fold change in cytokine mRNA expression is also highly dependent on the initial transcript level, particularly in the case of real-time PCR. Therefore, the relative fold-change per cell type may vary significantly between detection by real-time PCR versus that observed with microarray analysis [40]. This may also explain why the relative fold-change in cytokine mRNA expression is not consistent with protein expression. The microarray and real-time PCR analysis of cytokine genes in the current study indicate substantial differences in cytokine expression between microglia and astrocytes following TLR7 stimulation, including Il-6, Il1a and Il-12. However, protein analysis of these same cytokines showed similar levels in culture supernatants between astrocytes and microglia following TLR activation [20]. Thus, fold increase in gene expression is an indication of the upregulation of the mRNA, but is not a true representation of overall protein production.",

Thus, Ifi202b may be a unique transcript that is upregulated primarily by microglia in response to TLR activation. Ifi202b mRNA was induced in the brain following MuLV and LACV infection (Fig 6) and was recently found to be induced in the CNS following Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection [44]. IFI202b is a transcriptional regulator which has been shown to down-regulate AIM2 inflammasome signaling and regulate interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) expression [45]. Interestingly, the Ifi202b gene is truncated by a microdeletion in the 5\u2019 flanking region and first exon in C57BL/6 mice, which affects the transcriptional expression in most, but not all, tissues [46]. Our current study indicates that Ifi202b mRNA is expressed in brain tissue from LACV-infected C57BL/6 mice (Fig 6). Thus, Ifi202b may be differentially regulated in the brain relative to other tissues.",

For example, Saa3 mRNA was upregulated at much higher levels in microglia following TLR7 stimulation compared to TLR9 stimulation (Fig 5). SAA3 protein is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome [47]. The NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves pro-IL1\u03b2 to IL-1\u03b2, which can mediate cellular damage in the brain by causing pyroptosis [48]. SAA3 can prime glial cells to produce IL-1 at comparable levels to that observed by LPS stimulation [49]. Thus, the substantially higher increase in Saa3 mRNA in microglia following TLR7 stimulation, as compared to TLR9 stimulation, may result in higher levels of active IL-1\u03b2, which could have a substantial effect on the inflammatory response in the CNS.",

Traf1 and Birc3 products are members of the NF\u03baB canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways that have recently been shown to interact with each other to regulate TNF signaling [50]. Increased transcription of these two genes may be essential for microglia and/or astrocytes to respond to subsequent immune stimuli. Another upregulated transcript, Gpr84, produces a protein that is expressed primarily on myeloid cells, recognizes medium chain fatty acids and is involved in immune regulation. Interestingly, a two base pair frameshift deletion in Gpr84 has been identified in several mouse strains including DBA/1, FVB/NJ, NOD and SJL/J [51]. Since Gpr84 is induced in both microglia and astrocytes, this frameshift deletion could affect the responses of glial cells to infection in these mouse strains.",

Microarray analysis demonstrated that TLR stimulation induces the upregulation and down-regulation of mRNAs for substantially more genes in microglia than in astrocytes. However, one explanation for this difference may be due to the sensitivity of microarray analysis, since real-time PCR detected transcriptional changes of the same genes in astrocytes, although not to the same fold-increase as microglia. Analysis of a subset of these genes identified at least one gene, Ifi202b, which was specific to microglia and was upregulated not only in vitro, but also induced by virus infection, in vivo. Other genes, including Gpr84 and Birc3, as well as expressed transcripts AW112010 and BC023105 were consistently upregulated in activated microglia and astrocytes and were also upregulated in the CNS following virus infection. Thus, these genes may be useful markers of glial activation following infection or damage in the CNS.",
