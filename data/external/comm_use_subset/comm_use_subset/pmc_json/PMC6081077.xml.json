            "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes progressive disorder of joint function. It is the leading cause of disability and poor quality of life among the elderly in developed countries.[1] Knee OA is also prevalent in East Asian countries.[2] The occurrence of knee OA increases with age, particularly in women. In adults over the age of 45, 6% to 13% of men are affected, whereas 7% to 19% of women are affected, demonstrating a 45% lower risk of incidence for men.[3,4] The prevalence of OA is markedly higher among women than men and increases noticeably with age.[5,6] Knee OA occurs in 12% of American adults 65 years old or elder, and in 13% of women and 10% of men 60 years old or older in the United States.[7\u20139] The prevalence of OA is 15% in women and 5.6% in men 60 years old or older in Beijing, China.[10] The current occurrences of OA among the elderly population in Taiwan is about 37% in individuals over 50 years old.[11] The demographic crisis of ageing is spreading worldwide, including in Taiwan. Taiwan has been defined as an ageing society (according to the United Nation classification) since 1993, when the percentage of the population over 65 years old reached 7%. The percentage of the Taiwan population that is over 65 years old is forecast to surpass 14% by 2017, rapidly increasing to 20% by 2025.[12\u201314]",

The increase in rates of TKA from 2001 to 2007 was 59% in the United States and 73% in Ontario.[23] The annual primary TKA volume increased 161.5% from 93,230 to 226,177 between 1991 and 2010.[24] There were 10,132 primary TKA for OA in Australia in 1994, which increased by 42.8% to 14,472 in 1998.[25] Primary TKA rates increased by 407% in Korea from 2001 to 2010, according to data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service of Korea.[26] Taiwan became an ageing society in 1993, when the proportion of those aged over 65 exceeded 7% of the country's population.[12] The proportion of people over 65 years old was 9% to 10.7% between 2002 and 2010.[27] Policies for an ageing population should include health care utilization of TKR and prevention of OA. This seems to have increased the annual incidence rate of TKR between 1996 and 2010. However, there was a downward trend in incidence of TKR in 2003. This may be attributed to the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in that year. In that year, many people were afraid of getting SARS, and avoided going to hospitals.[28]",

To control the dramatic growth in medical expenditures, the administration of NHI is gradually changing its payment system from a fee-for-service payment to case payment.[36] According to the data from Taiwan's Health Insurance Bureau, about 6500 people undergo TKR every year. TKR is a surgical operation that has high utilization and high consumption of medical resources in Taiwan.[37] We found that the trends in the mean cost per patient and the ALOS for TKR have fallen slowly from 1996 to 2010. There was a small peak in the cost and the mean length of stay for TKR in 1999. The trend analysis of medical resource utilization showed that the mean cost per patient and ALOS markedly declined; the reduction may have been due to advances in medical technology and sciences.[38] In the United States, LOS reduced from 7.9 days (95% CI: 7.8\u20137.9) in 1991 to 1994 to 3.5 days (95% CI: 3.5\u20133.5) in 2007 to 2010.[24] The finding of decreasing trend in ALOS was similar to the results of other studies conducted in Taiwan.[20,39\u201341] However, it is obvious that the ALOS of TKR in Taiwan was longer than that in United States, which suggests that there is still more room for improvement in TKR treatment.",

The average hospital charges of TKR increased from $39.69 to $83.35 million (an increase of 110.00%). Many clinical parameters have been found to have a strong relationship with hospital charges in previous studies. Patients are inclined to look for hospitals with high surgical quantity and treatment from surgeons when the hospital charges increase.[44,45] Another possible reason for the rise of the total medical expenditures is that population ages and life expectancy increases.[46] Nevertheless, a lot of clinical parameters could not be examined in our study due to the collection of the limited data. First, some comorbidities may be under-reported by using ICD-9 codes. Second, it is not possible to gain detailed information related to lifestyle, exercise, diet, and other risk factors that may affect the TKR procedure from the insurance claims database. Third, we could not estimate real biologic factors, because they were not recorded in the NHIRD.",
