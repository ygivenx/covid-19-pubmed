            "text": "The complex mechanisms driving the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases remain poorly understood. The drugs currently in clinical use cannot effectively eliminate autoimmune diseases and may cause side effects. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have shown that innate immune disorders are closely related to autoimmune diseases [1]. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system are able to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger relevant signal transmission leading to inflammatory responses. Unfortunately, excessive inflammation can induce autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis [2\u20135]. Therefore, identification of new therapeutic targets to ameliorate autoimmune pathogenesis has become a research priority.",

TLRs recognize specific PAMPs: TLR3 and TLR7/8 recognize double-stranded and single-stranded (ss) RNA, respectively, and TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG-DNA [8\u201312]. The receptors utilize various downstream signaling cascades; for example, TLR3 depends on the TRIF pathway and TLR7 on the MyD88 pathway. Nevertheless, activation through different TLRs induces similar proinflammatory responses, characterized by release of factors such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [13]. TLR activation can result in the formation of the Nod-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome [14] and promote the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, which are involved in many diseases [15, 16].",

Moreover, excessive inflammation is often caused by multiple PAMPs [17\u201319]. Thus, the coactivation of numerous TLRs adds to the complexity. Current drugs nonselectively target the terminal process and inhibit the resulting proinflammatory factors. Antibodies against TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-23 have all been used to treat psoriasis. Although this therapeutic strategy has shown some promise, it is also associated with a higher risk of serious infections [20, 21]. By contrast, targeting upstream processes could decrease side effects and serve as an optimal therapeutic strategy. Unfortunately, no rational drug target has yet been identified.",

            "text": "Intracellular TLRs generally use distinct downstream signaling cascades; TLR3 signals through the TRIF pathway, while TLR7 and TLR9 signal through the MyD88 pathway. CpG-c41 mediates the same immunosuppressive effects on these TLRs, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression is not related to downstream signaling cascades. Although crosstalk is a common phenomenon due to intersection of the different signaling pathways, this study indicates that the immunosuppressive effects of CpG-c41 on other intracellular TLRs are not dependent on crosstalk with TLR9. Taken together, these findings suggest that CpG-c41 could mediate its suppressive effects by acting on the processes of ligand internalization or transfer, upstream of the signaling cascades.",

More recent studies have found that many CpG-ODNs do not have immunostimulatory properties; in fact, only some CpG-ODNs block the activation of TLR9 [18, 36]. As we previously reported, CpG-c41, which we screened from a large collection of nonimmunostimulatory CpG-ODNs, has a special sequence structure and an outstanding capacity to suppress TLR9 activation [22]. In this study, we discovered additional evidence that CpG-c41 has multiple immunosuppressive effects. Interestingly, we found that the TLR9 agonist CpG-1826 had similar immunosuppressive effects on TLR3 and TLR7, even when its immunostimulatory function was lost in TLR9\u2212/\u2212 cells. Unlike TLR9, the other intracellular TLRs are inhibited by the above CpG-ODNs through an alternative mechanism. Moreover, although both TLR7 and TLR9 depend on the MyD88 pathway, CpG-1826 had immunosuppressive effects in TLR7-replete TLR9\u2212/\u2212 conditions. These findings support the interpretation that CpG-ODN-mediated immunosuppression is unrelated to the downstream signaling cascade.",
