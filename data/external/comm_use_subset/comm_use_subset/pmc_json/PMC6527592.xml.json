            "text": "The ostrich (Struthio camelus var. domesticus) is the largest living, flightless bird species belonging to the ratite group (1). Although ostriches are traditionally endemic to Africa, parts of Arabia and the Middle East (2), they are reared in several countries across the world. South Africa, however, is currently the largest producer of ostrich products (meat, leather, and feathers) on international markets (3). Here, the majority of ostriches destined for slaughter are reared in free-range systems, but when environmental conditions are unfavorable for grazing, they are reared in grow-out camps from about 3 months of age (4). Mycoplasma, a genus of bacteria that belongs to the prokaryotic class Mollicutes, is known to be highly infectious in these intensive rearing systems (5, 6). Characteristic features of mycoplasma include the lack of a cell wall, small AT-rich genome and a minimal set of genes (7, 8). The species found to specifically infect ostriches are \u201cMycoplasma struthionis sp. nov.\u201d str. Ms01, Mycoplasma sp. str. Ms02, and \u201cMycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.\u201d str. Ms03 (9, 10). They are typically associated with upper respiratory tract infections (9), reduced growth rates, downgrading of carcasses and in extreme cases, chick mortalities (5, 9). The severity of infections increases with exposure to environmentally induced stress, other bacterial and viral infections. Of the three Mycoplasma species, \u201cMycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.\u201d str. Ms03 was found to have the highest prevalence (6) amongst ostriches and therefore was the focus of this study.",

            "text": "Mycoplasma infections are currently managed using a combination of biosecurity systems and antibiotics. With antibiotics there is the risk of resistance (11) as well as an accumulation of residues in meat with concomitant risks for consumers (12). Development of whole organism vaccines for use in ostriches is limited by the slow-growing nature of these organisms and the cost of medium required to sustain growth. DNA vaccines, on the other hand, do not require large scale cultivation of the pathogen, can be produced at relatively low cost and are more temperature stable than other vaccines (13, 14). It is therefore an attractive alternative for use in ostriches where the vaccine market is small, relative to e.g., poultry, and ostriches are usually farmed in semi-arid or arid regions where temperatures are frequently high and cold storage of vaccines can be problematic. Similar to live vaccines, they are also able to stimulate humoral and cellular immunity as indicated by measuring antibody, T-helper cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses (15). but unlike live vaccines cannot revert back to an infectious form (16). El Gazzar et al. (17) has reported the reversion to virulence of a commonly used live mycoplasma vaccine in poultry, ts-11, whilst another has reported possible genetic recombination between live vaccines and field strains upon long term use (18). This exchange or transfer of genes could have a negative impact on either the pathogenicity or transmissibility of field strains. Chromosomal integration of DNA vaccines is of some concern, but preclinical and clinical studies have shown the rate of integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome to be lower than that of spontaneous mutations (19, 20). To date, DNA vaccines have not been tested in ostriches or any other ratites. The aim of this study was to use the OppA protein of \u201cM. nasistruthionis sp. nov.\u201d str. Ms03 as antigen in the development and evaluation of DNA vaccines in ostriches at different doses and using different vectors.",

As a result of their parasitic lifestyle (7), mycoplasmas possess, and rely on, a wide range of transmembrane transport systems for their survival. The extracellular components of these transporters are ideal targets for vaccine development (21, 22). In this study the extracellular OppA domain of an oligopeptide permease (Opp) transporter was chosen as protein antigen (23, 24). Using mouse models, OppA has to date been evaluated as antigen in subunit vaccines against Brachyspira pilosicoli (25), Moraxella catarrhalis (26), and Yersinia pestis (27), as well as against Haemophilus parasuis in pigs (28). OppA has, however, not been evaluated in any organism as part of a DNA vaccine. In this study we report, for the first time, that a DNA vaccine can elicit a humoral immune response in ostriches using OppA as antigen. This response was both dose and vector dependent.",

This highlights a possible role of the vaccine vector in the observed antibody responses. The VR1020_oppA vaccine, on average, elicited higher titer values compared to the pCI-neo_oppA vaccine, which might be due to the TPA signal sequence of the VR1020 plasmid, which is situated upstream of the oppA gene, and assists with protein expression in mammalian cells and export of the protein out of the cell. This would in turn increase the immunogenicity of the antigen (45). In addition to this, sequences in the plasmid backbone have intrinsic immunostimulatory activity which enhance the immune system's response to the expressed protein antigen (51, 52).",

The absence of detectable mycoplasma infections at the earlier time points may be ascribed to Fraserburg being outside of the commercial ostrich production region. The Oudtshoorn district, on the other hand, has a higher incidence of mycoplasma infections especially during seasonal changes and our trial was conducted during late autumn. Amongst the vaccinated groups, the number of detected Ms03 and Ms01 infections were low compared to Ms02, with only the 1200 \u03bcg VR1020_oppA and control group having no detectable ostrich-infecting mycoplasmas.
