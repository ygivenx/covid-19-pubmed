More than 700 million people (including visitors on business or personal/family trips) traverse nation-state borders annually [2,3] and one million per week move between the global South and the global North [4]. The enormity of contemporary transnational mobility is illustrated by the case of Australia. In the past half century, Australia's \"resident population has doubled, while the movement of people across its international boundaries (that is, into and out of Australia) has increased nearly one hundredfold\" [5].",

People on the move can either \"introduce new or previously eradicated diseases to the region of destination, or contract diseases unknown to the migrants' region of origin\" [[16], p.85]. Recent examples include the rapid transcontinental transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the spread of the polio virus from northern Nigeria to Indonesia [17-21], and the threat of an avian influenza pandemic [22].

Downstream from many of the sources of infectious disease and the onset of chronic illness, [11] migrants and health professionals come together in medical-treatment and health-promotion encounters. In the context of contemporary population mobility, many health outcomes are shaped by transnational interactions among care providers and care recipients who meet in settings where nationality/ethnic match is not an option. In transnational consultations, clinicians and patients often deal with a wide variety of unfamiliar health threats and behaviors [26,27]. Prospects for reaching individually and socially positive outcomes are complicated when incongruent perspectives regarding physical and/or mental health problems, objectives, means for resolving problems, and outcomes prevail among professionals and service users of diverse nationality [28,29].",

This review article focuses on the need to reorient a different dimension of global health governance: physician education. Education for transnational care merits special attention for at least three reasons: (1) medical professionals (physicians, mental-health-care providers, nurses, public-health specialists, and their teachers) form the backbone of the health sector throughout the world; (2) preparing physicians for cross-national medical encounters offers a change strategy that is proactive and encompasses the creation of health gain in a world characterized by continued population exchanges rather than a strategy that is exclusively or primarily reactive and preoccupied with eliminating disease; [30] and (3) medical-school education holds out the promise of contributing to the reduction of health disparities in an immediate and observable fashion.",

In addition to multiple nationalities, physicians are challenged by bicultural, multicultural, and third-culture (different from both origin and host) [31] patients. Culture-competence education, initially intended for mastery of specific domestic two-culture interactions, [32] is of limited utility in today's diverse, hybrid, and rapidly changing patient-care environment [33,28].

Individual health-care abilities and opportunities are not independent of forces linked to globalization \u2013 including economic, political, and military incursions that result in displacement and migration [50]. A recent African war-zone study carried out by Physicians for Human Rights concluded that the \"first killer is flight\" for desperately poor persons driven by conflict from a fragile existence into a hostile and personally threatening environment where health services are nonexistent or not functioning [51]. Migrants who leave behind safe social settings often are obliged to congregate in vulnerable spatial surroundings. Mobility simultaneously facilitates cumulative social-change processes (including isolation, marginalization, segregation, and discrimination) and risk-taking behaviors that are associated with increased susceptibility to and spread of noncommunicable as well as communicable disease [47,49,52-54]]. For this reason, HIV/AIDS researchers are devoting increased attention to the role of social disruption and migration to \"hot spot\" environments in fueling the epidemic [47,12,55]. To add insult to injury, the health problems of displaced and otherwise dislocated people tend to be officially \"invisible\" and are likely to be bypassed by potentially beneficial interventions [56].",

Supportive actions on behalf of disadvantaged and underserved patients include facilitating access to social and health services provided by the host society; facilitating access to traditional healers and medicine as well as scarce (but, sometimes locally available) indigenous nutritional supplements; facilitating access to lay (community) health workers and intercultural mediators; assisting with the development of host-country language proficiency; promoting further education and credential (re-)certification; facilitating employment; help with moves into improved housing; [61] promoting the maintenance of children's healthy practices; [31,62] encouraging legal/policy coalition building with host-society institutions and transnational NGOs; and acting as the patient's advocate within the medical establishment and with government agencies and community associations.",

The medical consultation is approached as a partnership, with the patient participating as teacher as well as learner and the student valuing the learning and mentoring dimensions of his/her role [58,71]. The patient's voice is treated as an indispensable source of expertise and experiential insight [37,72]. Rather than ignoring the perspectives of the least advantaged, [64] preparation for the TC encounter revolves around patient-oriented inquiries that are designed to promote congruent perspectives among care seekers and care providers on health status and health promotion \u2013 regardless of differences in national origin, ethnicity, cultural identity(ies), and socio-economic (and political) status. Findings from clinical studies consistently show that, when treated as an interactive, partnership-based process, [73] the medical consultation directly and indirectly improves the outcome of health-care interventions [74,59,58,71]. The TC approach anticipates, therefore, that health-care outcomes will be enhanced when patients also possess transnational competence [75] and demand and inspire corresponding skills on the part of the clinicians who consult with them.",

Many \"refugee patients and their families bring to health consultation stories of incredible human resilience in the most extreme circumstances\" [[130], p.27, [110]]. Studies show that a sense of personal, family, and/or group efficacy constitutes a powerful determinant of the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting actions and is associated with a host of health-enhancement and illness-prevention outcomes [131-133,58]. Under the vulnerable and stressful environmental conditions that migrants face as the result of formidable language and cultural constraints, discrimination, the threat of long-term unemployment, and/or lack of social support, clinician appreciation for patient/family health-care assets, capabilities, and responsibilities reinforces individual and collective perceptions of transnational efficacy and strengthens confidence, perseverance, and power to sustain new and demanding psychological and physiological health-enhancing behaviors [132]. Capable self/family illness management is particularly valuable in treating many chronic diseases [134]. Among medical students, emotional competence also involves self-monitoring and reflection; that is, life-long openness to critical self-appraisal, to learning in place of stereotyping, [135] and to promoting emotional growth [136]. Box 2 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the emotional-skill domain.",

In New York City, for instance, patients might speak one of 150 different languages [162] Thus, TC education emphasizes skill in using an interpreter, the importance of employing trained medical interpreters, [163-166,153,158,160,111,157,48] and host-language preparation and communication training for patients [134].",

For maximum effect, the core elements of a TC education need to be longitudinally woven into required pre-clinical and clinical education through instructional approaches that encompass lectures, small-group discussions that include reference to the consequences of patient stereotyping, analysis of written and videotaped case studies, constant reference to clinical applications, interaction with community leaders, training in interviewing skills, as well as experiential approaches such as role plays, [27] encounters with simulated patients, overseas immersion, [8,36] involvement in community service-learning projects, and carefully designed clinical clerkships. The didactic components of the longitudinal and integrated TC approach would establish the need for adaptable skills in the contemporary context of globalization and health, would build a comprehensive foundation of five skill domains, would highlight the special value of experiential learning and reflective practice when attending to migrants, and would emphasize the centrality of collaborative efforts to promote social justice in health care through multi-dimensionally sensitive and individual-patient responsive transnational medical encounters. Resources from the humanities (e.g., art, literature, autobiographical accounts of migrant-patient experiences) can be especially useful in the initial effort to awaken the student's imagination [146] and to convey TC concepts that are inherently important in caring for migrant patients [183]. To facilitate stakeholder buy-in, the instructional and experiential dimensions of TC medical education also require attention to faculty-selection criteria, resources for faculty development in skill-deficit domains and in unfamiliar pedagogical approaches, and institutional as well as external support for materials development, contributions by specialists, assessment exercises, and logistical arrangements. Medical schools and teaching hospitals also will need to reinforce or establish linkages with often fragmented migrant-community associations and with community-health advocates.",

In light of the existence of national subcultures and the presence of intracultural (and changing) variations that occur due to \"age, gender, income, education, acculturation, individual differences, and multiple other factors,\" general epidemiological evidence about the patient's country and its endemic diseases, ethnic group, or religious affiliation needs to be \"regarded as having some bearing but requires further validation to be considered immediately useful\" [[185], p.251\u2013252, [186,96,27,33]]. As Melanie Tervalon and Jann Murray-Garcia point out, \"only the patient is uniquely qualified to help the physician understand the intersection of race, ethnicity, religion, class, and so on in forming his (the patient's) identity and to clarify the relevance and impact of this intersection on the present illness or wellness experience\"; that is, \"how little or how much culture has to do with that particular clinical encounter\" [[135], p.121].",

In a TC-informed medical education, exposure to transnational medical encounters would constitute an integral part of all clinical clerkships. Clerkships that involve migrant patients present students with a variety of stimulating medical challenges framed by diverse cultural perspectives and social backgrounds [65] and, simultaneously, provide problem-solving opportunities for students to articulate helpful recommendations and rewarding interventions. When designing each TC clerkship experience, faculty would arrange for students to work closely with patients and family members from distinct and diverse cultural, ethnic, subcultural, generational, and socio-economic backgrounds. Gerrish, Husband, and Mackenzie warn that \"a de facto emphasis on cultural competence, with a resultant neglect of intercultural competence, must be resisted\" [37,134,135]]. Thus, TC clinical placements and preceptor-supervised encounters with patients [121] would avoid focusing on a single local population. Clinical assignments also should proceed to levels of increasing complexity and be linked to reflective seminars that involve sharing and group discussion of case-specific and transnational issue-related insights gained from interviews with multiple patients of diverse backgrounds and from students' health-promotion and social-context (advocacy) recommendations. For educators working at institutions in the few rural areas or population centers that remain relatively untouched by migration, the experiential component might need to supplement a relatively homogeneous patient base through student participation in out-of-country immersion programs, cooperative arrangements with urban medical schools, and/or videoconferencing [187].",

When working with ethnoculturally discordant patients, \"the ability to identify assets in a family beset by overwhelming liabilities\" as well as vulnerabilities \"often produces the turning point toward successful interventions\" [[188], p.269]. The bases for resilience vary among patients and are subject to change over time [189]. Possibilities for students to explore include: hopeful vision for the future; religious faith; self-reliance; personal history of overcoming adversity; roots; finding meaning/purpose in life; [189] and community mutual assistance and support [190]. In TC clerkships, students would learn that unduly pathologizing the migrant's experience [118] exaggerates deficiencies, risks fostering dependency, [191] and \"removes the matter from the political and social context that produced ... [the] anguish and loss\" [139]. TC clinical education also aims to provide the future physician with a toolbox of ways of reinforcing and expanding resilience (especially preparing patients to take responsibility for self care and problem solving in a confident manner, which often involves family and nonbiomedical supplements and addressing resource needs), reversing devaluation and disempowerment by providing opportunities for patients to demonstrate and develop role competence and increased control over their life both in and beyond health-care situations, [192] and enabling migrants to resist the adoption of health-adverse behaviors practiced by members of the receiving society [193,194]. Furthermore, TC clerkships would demonstrate that the extra time spent on caring behavior (estimated at 5\u20137 minutes per encounter until the caring relationship is established) results in multiple benefits for both practitioner and patient [137,181]. Increasingly, managed-care providers recognize that providing such quality attention more effectively contains health-care costs than does limiting services [115].",

In the transnational medical encounter, the patient's narrative of lived experience \u2013 including the migrant's stressful social and environmental situations, network of transnational social relations, and emerging identities [95] \u2013 is particularly valuable [145,96]. Genogram construction [178] constitutes another illuminating tool that can be built into the ethnographic interview. The ethnographic-learning experience should include observations in the patient's social territory; critical reflection on the medical impact of power relations, institutionalized constraints, and patient/family strengths; opportunities for the patient to comment upon the student's initial findings; preceptor feedback regarding the strengths and limitations of each student's interviews; and facilitated discussions with faculty in small-group settings of the students' findings as well as possible hidden social, economic, legal, and cultural contributors. The ethnographic approach reduces prospects that decisions will be based on stereotypic oversimplifications and/or insufficient information [196,48,128,112] and helps medical practitioners avoid the overgeneralized tendency to perceive and treat migrants as traumatized victims [95].",

The training and employment of medical interpreters, the conduct of ethnographic interviews, the professional development of medical-school faculty who are qualified to offer TC-informed courses and to supervise TC-centered clerkships, and the construction and execution of systematic evaluation studies constitute critical components of the educational framework presented here that will be well-served by supplemental external funding. This is particularly the case for resource-scarce universities in Southern countries. In addition to internal reallocations, a variety of national and international funding sources can be mobilized for program support. Ideally, the World Health Organization would assume responsibility for driving, and coordinating funding for, the TC initiative. The faculty-development and evaluation components also would be promoted by national government incentive programs carried forward in partnership with higher-education institutions, including the United Nations University. Foundations and associations of medical professionals could usefully contribute to the global TC educational initiative, with some programs specifically devoted to the preparation of professional medical interpreters, transnational navigators, and patient advocates along with TC training for migrants. Grounding in TC, along with receptivity to continued mutual South-North learning, could be fruitfully incorporated into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-supported \"E-learning Certification Programme in Global Health\" initiated through Oxford University [200] and into the post-graduate educational programs offered by the Department of Global Health at The University of Washington that will be launched in 2006 thanks to another Gates Foundation grant.",

In some cases, adopting the TC framework requires fundamental shifts in orientation and approach. Other medical schools are positioned to reinforce skills already covered (e.g., ethnographic interviewing, working with intercultural mediators) within the context of TC's encompassing and globally relevant framework. The advantages of TC-inspired redirection of medical education are manifold. TC preparation (1) provides an integrated and comprehensive set of practical and contemporary medical-consultation skills of value in an age of population mobility; (2) accepts that acquired mastery of the \"multiplicity of cultures that comprise the patient populations of today\" [[185], p.250] is neither feasible nor necessary for quality care and cost containment; instead, the TC approach focuses on discerning each patient's multiple and complex (rather than single-source) identities and distinctive health perspectives and personal needs in ways that build trust, confidence, and humility; (3) places the physical- and mental-health consequences of economic disparities and underlying global/local structural contributors front and center; (4) aims to equip both service users and service providers with parallel skills [75]; (5) addresses both the quality of patient care and social constraints on migrant health; and (6) applies to and promises to resonate well with clinicians in all countries who work with ethnoculturally and socioeconomically discordant patients. Consequently, a TC education would equip learners for global and not just local practice \u2013 an important qualification given the scope of contemporary population and professional mixing.",

Exploratory research suggests that TC skills can improve health-care outcomes in ethnoculturally discordant medical encounters, [29,97] although confirmation requires more elaborate and comparative investigations. Given that few medical schools have embarked on pilot TC programs to date, [201] that a full-blown TC curriculum would involve demanding expectations of currently stretched students and faculty, and that compelling evaluation results require additional outcome-based research studies, controls, and time, substantiating claims for the efficacy of TC education remains a future project. However, as the value of preparation in generic TC skills is further demonstrated through student assessment, modeling by clinician mentors, mistake avoidance, [184] patient satisfaction, quality assurance, and reduced health disparities, the future physician's intrinsic human and professional motivation [202] to interact ever more effectively on behalf of ethnoculturally and socioeconomically unfamiliar and disadvantaged patients will provide the foundation for, and facilitate openness to, the development of personal transnational competence in migrant-health care.",
