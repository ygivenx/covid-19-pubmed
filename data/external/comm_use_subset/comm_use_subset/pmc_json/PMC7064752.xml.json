            "text": "Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a bacterial pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Mild common infections include pharyngitis and impetigo, while more-serious infections such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and sepsis are relatively rare and yet life-threatening conditions. Poststreptococcal sequelae can manifest following repeated mild infections in the form of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The global burden of streptococcal diseases has been long neglected despite being responsible for an estimated 500,000 deaths annually (1). Recent advocacy efforts have highlighted the urgent need for the development of a vaccine that prevents GAS-related infections (2\u20134). M protein-based vaccines have been considered strong candidates, despite concerns over insufficient serotype coverage (N-terminal-based vaccines) and the association of M protein with the generation of cross-reactive antibodies linked to ARF and RHD (5). On the other hand, non-M protein-based vaccines have emerged as alternative candidates that overcome such concerns. Regardless of the choice of GAS antigen used as a vaccine candidate, the choice of adjuvant, a significant element of the final vaccine formulation, has generally been overlooked. Aluminum salts (alum) have represented the most common adjuvant used to test GAS vaccine candidates (6\u20139). For M-protein based vaccines, alum has proven effective for the generation of opsonizing antibodies, which are associated with protection against infection in animal models (10, 11).",

Our research has focused on the development of Combo5 vaccine, a combination of 5 GAS protein antigens (arginine deiminase, [ADI], C5a peptidase [SCPA], streptolysin O [SLO], interleukin-8 protease [SpyCEP], and trigger factor [TF]). We previously tested Combo5 formulated with alum in murine and nonhuman primate (NHP) models of infection with various results. While immunization with Combo5/alum decreased the severity of clinical signs but did not reduce colonization in a NHP pharyngitis model of infection (12) and provided protection in a murine superficial skin infection model, the same formulation failed to protect in a murine invasive model of disease (13). In this study, taking advantage of the opportunity presented by these findings, we examined the protective capacity of Combo5 formulated with a panel of different adjuvants (Table 1) using the invasive GAS disease model. The level of protection from lethal challenge ranged from 20% to 90% survival among the different formulations. We further characterized the protective immune response elicited by Combo5 formulated with SMQ adjuvant and compared this to the nonprotective response elicited by Combo5/alum and to the protective response elicited by the \u201cgold standard\u201d homologous M1 protein formulated with alum.",

One primary and two booster immunizations were delivered via intramuscular injection into the thigh muscle. Serum samples from day 35 were used to measure antigen-specific antibodies against all proteins contained in Combo5. Antigen-specific total IgG endpoint titers against all antigens (ADI, SCPA, SLO, SpyCEP, and TF) with all adjuvanted vaccines (Fig. 1A, blue circles) were significantly higher than the titers seen with their corresponding negative controls (Fig. 1A, black circles).

Four mice per group were immunized with Combo5/SMQ, Combo5/alum, and M1/alum, and naive mice were used as negative controls. At day 35 following one primary immunization and two booster immunizations, animals were humanely euthanized to obtain blood and spleens for further analyses. Levels of antigen-specific IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3) were measured in serum samples. IgG1 serum titers against ADI were significantly higher in Combo5/alum-immunized mice than in those immunized with Combo5/SMQ (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, anti-ADI IgG2c titers were significantly higher in Combo5/SMQ-immunized mice than in Combo5/alum-immunized mice. Titers for anti-ADI IgG2b and IgG3 were comparable in the two groups. Anti-SCPA and anti-TF IgG2b and IgG2c titers were significantly higher in mice that received the Combo5/SMQ formulation than in those that received Combo5/alum, while titers against the same antigens were comparable for IgG1 and IgG3 (Fig. 3A). IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 titers against SLO were significantly higher in Combo5/SMQ-immunized mice than in those treated with Combo5/alum, whereas the IgG1 titers were equivalent for the two formulations (Fig. 3A). Anti-SpyCEP IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 antibody titers were not significantly different between Combo5 formulations, but a significant difference was observed in IgG2c titers, which were between 103 and 104 in the Combo5/SMQ group, while the IgG2c titers were undetectable in the Combo5/alum group (Fig. 3A). The anti-M1 IgG subclass response following immunization with M1/alum was characterized by high IgG1 titers followed by IgG2b titers and low titers for IgG2c and IgG3 antibodies (Fig. 3B). IgG1/IgG2c ratios were calculated for each antigen in both Combo5 and M1 protein formulations (Fig. 3C). Ratios closer to 1 were observed for Combo5/SMQ, indicating a more balanced Th1/Th2 response (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, higher ratios were obtained for Combo5 and M1 antigens formulated with alum, suggesting a Th2-biased antibody response (Fig. 3C).",

Prevention of a number of clinical manifestations caused by GAS would not only lower disease burden but also reduce the prescription of antibiotics and therefore positively contribute to the fight against antimicrobial resistance (14, 15). The non-M protein Combo5 vaccine contains 5 conserved GAS proteins (ADI, SCPA, SLO, SpyCEP, and TF) that have low sequence variation and high coverage among GAS isolates from different geographical regions (16). Using alum as an adjuvant, we have tested Combo5 in different animal models with various results. Immunization with Combo5/alum provided protection in a superficial skin infection model in mice (13) and decreased the severity of pharyngitis and tonsillitis clinical signs in a pharyngitis model in nonhuman primates (12). On the other hand, the same formulation failed to provide protection using the humanized plasminogen mouse model of invasive lethal infection (13). Given that the humanized plasminogen mouse model is a well-established model to evaluate systemic GAS dissemination (17, 18) and that vaccine-induced protection was evident in this model when purified M1 protein was used as an antigen, we decided to investigate whether alternative adjuvants could improve the efficacy of Combo5. In this study, we tested six different adjuvants (Table 1), each containing molecules with immunomodulatory properties.",

SWE adjuvant is a squalene-in-water emulsion. The composition of SWE adjuvant is similar to that of MF59, an adjuvant currently used in several influenza vaccines available on the market (22), which has been shown to promote recruitment of immune cells to the injection site and enhance antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells (23) by promoting local release of ATP (24).

LMQ also contains the synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist 3-0-desacyl-4-monophosphoryl lipid A (3D-MPL). A bacterium-derived TLR4 agonist has shown a synergistic adjuvant effect when combined with the saponin QS21 in the neutral liposome carrier AS01 adjuvant. AS01 is included in Mosquirix (RTS,S) malaria vaccine and Shingrix (HZ/su) herpes zoster vaccine, both of which are approved for human use (26). SMQ is a squalene-in-water emulsion containing cholesterol, synthetic 3D-MPL, and QS21. The AS02 adjuvant, also a combination of emulsion containing a bacterial TLR4 agonist and QS21, has been tested in humans as part of the development of the Mosquirix (RTS,S) vaccine (27). Combo5 formulated with LQ, LMQ, or SMQ provided significant protection against invasive lethal GAS infection, with 80%, 80%, or 90% survival, respectively. Given that the common ingredient between these three adjuvant formulations is QS21 (Table 1), we hypothesize that addition of QS21 is crucial for protection against GAS in this invasive challenge model. Given that the antibody titers against all five proteins in Combo5 did not predict protection in the different adjuvant groups, we hypothesize that T cell immunity may be a more relevant predictor of protection in this model.",

            "text": "A pressing issue in GAS vaccine development is the establishment of a correlate of protection that can be used to fast-track the licensure of a vaccine candidate (3). Opsonizing antibodies have long been associated with protection against infection for M protein-based vaccines and following natural infection (29, 30). In our previous report, opsonizing antibodies were detected in sera from Combo5/alum-immunized mice by the use of the classical Lancefield whole-blood indirect bactericidal assay (13). In the present study, we were not able to detect opsonic antibodies by the use of the standardized HL-60 assay for Combo5/alum. Discrepancies between these two assays in the detection of opsonic antibodies have been reported in the past (31). The technical complexity of the classical Lancefield whole-blood assay makes it unfeasible for use in clinical trials, while the HL-60 assay may become more widely accepted as the standardized assay to investigate the presence of opsonizing antibodies against GAS. In this study, mice immunized with Combo5/SMQ were protected against invasive lethal challenge in the absence of opsonizing antibodies. Consequently, this work provides evidence that the opsonizing antibody correlates of protection paradigm do not necessarily apply for non-M protein antigens. This finding highlights one of the weaknesses that need to be addressed on the road to licensure for a GAS vaccine. To begin to address this issue, cellular recall responses were investigated in antigen-stimulated splenocytes from immunized mice. Combo5/alum-immune splenocytes mainly secreted cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13), indicating a Th2-type signature, with low levels of TNF-\u03b1. In contrast, Combo5/SMQ-immune splenocytes secreted a wider variety of cytokines, including Th1-type and Th2-type cytokines. Combo5/SMQ immunization resulted in strong secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 and of Th1-type cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, suggesting a potential role for Th1 responses in protection against invasive GAS infection following vaccination. It has been previously reported that SCPA-specific IFN-\u03b3 responses may play an important role in age-related immunity to GAS following natural exposure in humans (32). This observation, which is in line with our results, highlights the importance of Th1 responses (especially that of IFN-\u03b3) in protective immunity against GAS infections.",

Mouse models are ideal for initial preclinical testing of vaccine candidates, and in this particular case, the humanized plasminogen mouse model allowed us to investigate the effect of different adjuvants to promote the protective efficacy of Combo5. To further advance Combo5/SMQ as a vaccine candidate, it is crucial to investigate its efficacy using more-representative models of infection, such as the pharyngitis model in nonhuman primates (12) or, potentially, the experimental human challenge models that are being developed (33). This pathway of vaccine testing could ideally be used for other GAS vaccine candidates, in order to build strong evidence of vaccine efficacy against GAS infections.",

SWE, LQ, LMQ, and SMQ adjuvant formulations were manufactured at the Vaccine Formulation Institute. SWE adjuvant (squalene-in-water emulsion) was prepared as previously described (36).

Binding was detected by flow cytometry, and T(X) values, shown on the lower right side of each histogram, were determined by using the probability binning algorithm in FlowJo to compare samples of bacteria incubated with immune sera to samples incubated with naive sera. A cutoff value for the statistic T(X) was established by comparing T(X) values between sample replicates, and a T(X) value of >200 was considered significant (P < 0.01).
