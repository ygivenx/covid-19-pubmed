The translation of their messenger-sense RNA genome yields the core viral enzymes that always include an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and assemble into a cytoplasmic machinery for viral RNA synthesis. Many +RNA virus groups employ polycistronic genomes and different mechanisms to express genes located downstream of the 5\u2032-proximal open reading frame (ORF). One of these mechanisms involves the synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (referred to as \u201ctranscription\u201d in this paper).

Human coronaviruses are associated with respiratory disease (including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), reviewed in [2]) and arteriviruses like porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are important veterinary pathogens. Members of the nidovirus order are characterized by their exceptional genetic complexity, and the group includes the virus families with the largest RNA genomes described to date (25\u201332 kb). Nidoviruses share important traits in their genome organization and gene expression mechanisms, and their key replicative enzymes are presumed to be evolutionarily related (for a review, see [3]). Their polycistronic genomes are 5\u2032-capped, 3\u2032-polyadenylated, and the two 5\u2032-most open reading frames (ORFs) \u2013 ORF1a and ORF1b, encode the viral replicase subunits segregated in two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, the expression of the latter controlled by a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift (Fig. 1A). Autoproteolytic processing of these precursors generates between 13 and 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that direct viral RNA synthesis. Besides genome replication, arteri- and coronavirus RdRp-containing complexes also mediate the synthesis of a distinctive nested set of sg mRNAs that are both 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-coterminal with the viral genome and hence consist of sequences that are noncontiguous in the genomic RNA (Fig. 1B).",

Studies with nidovirus model systems such as equine arteritis virus (EAV), the arterivirus prototype, have provided some critical insights about viral replicase functions and the regulation of RNA synthesis in infected cells. EAV replicase pp1a and pp1ab are co- and post-translationally cleaved into 13 nsps by viral proteases residing in nsp1, nsp2, and nsp4. The seven viral structural proteins, which are all dispensable for replication and transcription [4], are encoded in a set of overlapping ORFs located in the 3\u2032-proximal quarter of the genome (Fig. 1A). In the six sg mRNAs used to express these ORFs, a common \u201cleader\u201d sequence representing the 5\u2032-proximal 206 nucleotides of the genome is linked to different \u201cbody\u201d segments that are co-linear with the 3\u2032-proximal part of the genome (Fig. 1B).",

            "text": "According to the widely supported model proposed by Sawicki and Sawicki [5] (Fig. 1C), the structure of the arterivirus and coronavirus sg mRNAs derives from a discontinuous step during minus-strand RNA synthesis, which is guided by specific RNA signals and resembles copy-choice RNA recombination [6]\u2013[8]. Conserved transcription-regulating sequences (TRS; core sequence 5\u2032 UCAACU 3\u2032 in EAV) precede each structural protein ORF (body TRSs). The same sequence motif is also present at the 3\u2032-end of the genomic leader sequence (leader TRS). Minus-strand RNA synthesis, initiated at the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome, is presumably attenuated at one of the body TRS regions (Fig. 1C; reviewed in [9],[10]). Subsequently, the nascent minus strand, carrying the body TRS complement at its 3\u2032end, is translocated to the 5\u2032-proximal region of the genomic template. During this step, the genomic leader TRS serves as a base-pairing target for the 3\u2032 end of the nascent minus strand, a role that is facilitated, in the case of EAV, by its presence in the loop of an RNA hairpin [11]. When minus strand synthesis resumes, nascent strands are extended with the complement of the genomic leader sequence, yielding a nested set of subgenome-length minus-strand templates that are used for the subsequent synthesis of the various sg mRNAs. If attenuation does not occur, minus-strand RNA synthesis proceeds to yield a full-length complement of the genome, the intermediate required for its replication.",

            "text": "Clearly, the protein and RNA factors that determine whether a nidovirus RdRp complex operates in continuous or discontinuous mode, i.e. produces a full-length or a subgenome-length minus strand, must be critical for the coordination of the nidovirus replicative cycle. As in other nidoviruses, the EAV genomic RNA (RNA1) and sg mRNAs (RNA2\u2013RNA7) accumulate in specific molar ratios (see Fig. 1B) that are essentially constant until the peak of viral RNA synthesis is reached [12]. The relative abundance of the transcripts is presumably dictated by the \u201cattenuation rate\u201d at each of the successive body TRSs encountered during minus-strand synthesis, which is primarily determined by the base-pairing potential between the leader TRS and the body TRS complement in the nascent minus strand. Also the sequence context of body TRS motifs and their proximity to the genomic 3\u2032end, which is reflected in the \u201cgradient\u201d of sg RNA sizes, can influence the accumulation of viral RNA species. The importance of TRS-driven RNA-RNA interactions and the potential for a regulatory role of higher order RNA structures was outlined above (reviewed in [9],[10]). At the protein level, however, only a single nidovirus protein specifically involved in transcription was identified thus far: EAV nsp1 was found to be essential for sg mRNA production, while being dispensable for genome replication [13],[14]. Remarkably, nsp1 is also the first protein expressed during infection: it is co-translationally released from the nascent replicase polyproteins by a papain-like cysteine proteinase activity (PCP\u03b2) in its C-terminal domain (Fig. 2). Comparative sequence analysis identified two additional conserved domains: a second, proteolytically silent PCP domain that is functional in other arteriviruses (PCP\u03b1; [15]), and an N-terminal zinc finger (ZF) domain [13],[16] that is critical for transcription and efficient production of infectious progeny [13],[14]. Since the accumulation of all sg mRNAs was blocked in the absence of nsp1, the protein was proposed to control a switch between replication and transcription [13].",

We also established that nsp1 modulates viral RNA accumulation in an mRNA-specific manner, and thus maintains the balance among the seven viral mRNAs, including the genome. Our data suggests that nsp1 does so by controlling the levels of the full-length and subgenome-length minus-strand templates required for viral mRNA synthesis.

By contrast, replacements of putative zinc-coordinating residues either selectively abolished transcription of all viral sg mRNAs or interfered with virus production without affecting viral mRNA accumulation. In an attempt to expand our repertoire of viable nsp1 mutants, we now used two approaches: i) alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-conserved clusters of polar residues found throughout the nsp1 sequence, and ii) a Cys\u2194His interchange at the positions of residues Cys-25 and His-27, which have both been implicated in zinc coordination [13],[16]. The first approach is less likely to perturb the protein's overall stability, since clusters of charged residues are usually found on the protein surface, where they may mediate interactions with other biomolecules via electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bond formation [20]\u2013[22]. We reasoned that the second approach might preserve zinc coordination but could nevertheless have a subtle effect on zinc binding that might be translated in a measurable effect on one or more of nsp1's functions. Moreover, if these substitutions would compromise virus replication, isolation of revertant viruses encoding compensatory second-site mutations might reveal potential regulatory protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions.",

In all three subdomains of nsp1, clusters of two or three charged amino acids within a five- to seven-amino acid stretch were substituted with Ala. Constructs with Ala replacements in the ZF domain were designated Z (1 to 3), while those with replacements in the PCP\u03b1 and PCP\u03b2 domains were designated A (1 to 4) and B (1 and 2), respectively (see Table 1 and Fig. 2). In addition, we swapped the Cys-25 and His-27 residues to generate the ZCH mutant. Full-length RNA transcribed from EAV cDNA clones encoding these nsp1 mutations was transfected into BHK-21 cells. Analysis of nsp1 mutant phenotypes was performed during the peak of viral RNA synthesis and before the bulk of infectious progeny was produced by the wild-type (wt) control (11 h post-transfection; referred to as first-cycle analysis). Previous studies of intracellular viral RNA levels had been hampered by the considerable variability in transfection efficiencies of synthetic EAV full-length RNAs. For comparison between mutants, these studies used the genomic RNA as an internal standard for each sample to calculate relative ratios of viral mRNA accumulation levels [6],[14]. Using an improved electroporation protocol (for details, see Materials and Methods), we now achieved very consistent and relatively high RNA transfection efficiencies (between 45% and 55% of positive cells at 11 h post-transfection with replication-competent synthetic EAV RNAs; data not shown). This allowed for the comparison of the absolute levels of mRNA accumulation and the detailed first-cycle analysis of EAV nsp1 mutants at a time point at which differences in virus production or (pseudo)reversion would not influence the assessment of their phenotype.",

Consequently, we first analyzed the impact of clustered charged-to-alanine replacements in nsp1 on viral mRNA accumulation. Cells transfected with nsp1 mutants were harvested 11 h after transfection, intracellular RNA was isolated and resolved in denaturing gels, and viral mRNAs were detected by hybridization to a probe complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the genome and thus recognizing all viral mRNAs. Substitutions in the ZF domain (mutant Z1), as well as in the region connecting the ZF and PCP\u03b1 domains (Z3), the PCP\u03b1 domain itself (A2) and, notably, also the PCP\u03b2 domain (B2) rendered viral sg mRNAs undetectable. In addition, all four mutants displayed a noticeable increase in genomic RNA levels (Fig. 3A). By contrast, accumulation of all viral mRNAs was blocked in the B1 mutant (Table 1 and data not shown), possibly due to the proximity of the charged cluster to the active site Cys of PCP\u03b2 (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that all subdomains of nsp1, including PCP\u03b2, are important for transcriptional control. This novel role of the PCP\u03b2 domain seems to be genetically separable from its autoproteolytic activity.",

These had no apparent effect on viral mRNA levels (Fig. 3B), while progeny virus titers were reduced by 10- and 200-fold, respectively (Fig. 3C), in supernatants harvested 24 h after transfection, well beyond the time point of maximum virus production by the wt control (data not shown). Accordingly, plaques of the Z2 mutant were somewhat smaller than those of the wt virus, and those of the A3 mutant were minute (Fig. 3C). Titers and plaque phenotypes remained essentially unchanged at 48 h post-transfection, arguing against a delay in virus production. Sequence analysis of the A3 progeny revealed reversion of the E113A mutation to the wt sequence at later time points (data not shown). These observations imply that both the ZF and the PCP\u03b1 domains of EAV nsp1 are involved in a step of the viral replicative cycle that is downstream of transcription and is critical for the efficient production of infectious virus particles.",

In this study, the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants displayed a third phenotype, demonstrating that replacements in nsp1 can affect EAV RNA levels in an mRNA-specific manner. The swapping of two proposed zinc-coordinating residues in the ZCH mutant resulted in the upregulation of a subset of sg mRNAs. In comparison to the wt control, the accumulation levels of RNA3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were increased, while those of the viral genome and RNA2 remained largely unchanged (Fig. 4, A and B). The increase in mRNA levels was not uniform, being more pronounced for RNA5 and RNA6 (4.5-fold and 3-fold, respectively) than for RNAs 3, 4, and 7 (\u223c2-fold). Also, the substitution of two positively charged residues in the PCP\u03b1 domain of the A1 mutant (see Fig. 2) resulted in reduced accumulation levels of RNA5 and RNA6 (3- to 4-fold), and RNA7 (\u223c30%), but not of RNAs 2 to 4 (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, genomic RNA accumulation was dramatically enhanced in the A1 mutant (Fig. 4, A and B). This aspect of the mutant phenotype had been previously described in mutants that did not produce any sg mRNAs [14], in which it was attributed to the increased availability of key factors for viral replication. This explanation does not seem likely for the A1 mutant, however, in which accumulation of only two of the six viral sg mRNAs was reduced (Fig. 4). Furthermore, another PCP\u03b1 mutant - A4 (see Fig. 2), displayed 4-fold higher levels of genome accumulation without any significant decrease in sg mRNA production (Fig. 4, A and B).",

To this end, we developed an RNase protection assay for the detection and quantification of EAV minus-strand RNA species. We employed a two-step protocol in which total RNA extracted from cells transfected with nsp1 mutants was first denatured and self-annealed. Due to the large excess of plus strands present in RNA samples extracted from EAV-infected cells [25], all minus strands are expected to be present in duplexes after this annealing step, facilitating their subsequent reliable quantification. The remaining single-stranded RNA was then removed by RNase T1 digestion. Following inactivation of the enzyme, we added an excess of 32P-labeled transcripts of positive polarity, which were derived either from a region unique to the EAV genome, or from the leader-body junction regions of RNA6 and RNA7. The samples were then subjected to a second round of RNA denaturation, hybridization, and digestion with RNase A and T1, after which the protected fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis.",

It was therefore important to determine whether viral protein levels indeed mirrored the specific changes in viral mRNA levels caused by mutations in nsp1. To this end, we examined the intracellular accumulation of the EAV replicase subunit nsp3, and the structural proteins M and N, in cell lysates harvested 11 h after transfection (Fig. 6A). When compared to the wt control, nsp3 was more abundant in cells transfected with the A1 and A4 mutants, in line with the increased genome levels observed for these mutants at the same time point (Fig. 4). The intracellular levels of the M and N proteins were also in general agreement with the abundance of their corresponding mRNA templates (RNA6 and RNA7, respectively). Interestingly, even the modest reduction in RNA7 levels detected for the A1 mutant (\u223c30%, Fig. 4B) was reflected in a decrease in N protein levels (Fig. 6A). The close correlation between mRNA and corresponding protein levels argues against the possibility that the engineered nsp1 mutations might have caused a defect in viral mRNA translation. Overall, these data establish that even modest changes in viral mRNA accumulation are directly translated into altered viral protein levels during EAV infection.",

EAV assembly involves the coordinated interplay of the N protein and six envelope proteins, all of which are required for virus infectivity [4],[26]. A critical step in assembly is the heterodimerization of the major viral envelope proteins, GP5 and M [27],[28], and both the GP5 and M protein levels, as well as the levels of their mRNA templates, RNA5 and RNA6, were strongly affected in the ZCH and A1 mutants (Fig. 4B and 6A). Furthermore, other documented interactions, such as the oligomerization of the minor envelope proteins - GP2b, GP3 and GP4\n[29], could be readily affected by the altered relative abundances of viral structural proteins. The decreased ratio of N protein and genomic RNA in the A1 and A4 mutants (Fig. 4B and Fig. 6A) could also adversely affect the assembly of infectious virions. Analysis of the infectious progeny virus titers in culture supernatants harvested 24 h after transfection with the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants indeed revealed a dramatic loss of infectivity (Fig. 6B).

Virions from medium harvested at 24 h after transfection with the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants were compared with the progeny produced by the wt control. Consistent with the reduction in infectious progeny titers, these results showed a decrease in the total number of genome-containing virus particles secreted from cells transfected with each of the three mutants (Table 2). Interestingly, when the relative specific infectivity of each mutant virion preparation was assessed by relating the genomic RNA content to the plaque-forming units (pfu), a marked decrease in the pfu per unit of genomic RNA ratio of the ZCH, A1, and A4 virion preparations was revealed (Table 2). The ZCH, A1, and A4 mutations thus seem to affect both the total number of secreted virions, as well as their specific infectivity. Also, even at this relatively early time point post transfection, the three mutants exhibited heterogeneous plaque morphology, indicative of rapid reversion (Fig. 6B). These results, together with the RNA and protein analyses outlined above (Fig. 4B and 6A), demonstrate that even moderate changes in the accumulation of EAV mRNAs and proteins can be associated with a dramatic decrease in the yield of infectious progeny. Thus, a previously unnoticed link seems to exist between the fine-tuning of the relative abundance of EAV mRNAs (and, consequently, viral protein levels) and the efficiency of virion biogenesis.",

By contrast, the rapid appearance of large plaque variants among the prevailing small plaques produced by the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants (see Fig. 6B) suggested genetic heterogeneity. Large plaque clones of these three mutants were isolated and propagated in fresh cells, and the EAV nsp1 gene was amplified by RT-PCR. Sequence analysis of the PCR products confirmed the presence of the originally engineered mutant codons, and identified additional mutations in the nsp1-coding sequence in the majority of the plaques analyzed (data not shown). A pseudorevertant of ZCH had acquired a substitution in the vicinity of the original mutations (Ala-29 to Asp). Interestingly, Ala-29 was also mutated in five independent A1 pseudorevertants, where it had been replaced with Lys due to two nucleotide substitutions (Table 3). In addition, four clones of the A4 offspring contained a Thr-196 to Lys substitution, and Gly-47 to Ala and Glu-112 to Lys replacements were found in one clone each.",

Cell culture supernatants harvested 24 h after transfection with RNA from nsp1 pseudorevertants indeed contained between 2 and \u223c4 logs more infectious progeny than those of the original mutants (Table 3), confirming the compensatory nature of the second-site mutations. Both virus titer and plaque size of the three viruses carrying a second-site mutation in the A4 mutant background were similar to those of the wt control (Table 3; data not shown). Replacement of Ala-29 with Asp or Lys in the ZCH and A4 backgrounds, respectively, increased virus titers by 2 to \u223c4 logs, with plaque sizes being intermediate between those of the parental mutant and the wt control (Table 3; data not shown). The relative specific infectivities of virion preparations derived from all nsp1 pseudorevertants were also considerably higher in comparison to those of the parental mutants (data not shown). Notably, the pseudorevertants showed a partial or complete restoration of the mRNA-specific defects that we had observed for the original mutants (Fig. 7). Introduction of the Ala-29 to Asp substitution in the ZCH mutant was accompanied by a considerable reduction of the otherwise abnormally high accumulation of RNAs 3 to 7, though RNA5 and RNA6 were still present at \u223c150% of the normal level (Fig. 7B). Likewise, the Ala-29 to Lys replacement moderated the effect of the A4 substitutions on the accumulation levels of RNA1, RNA5, and RNA6; those of RNA1 and RNA2 were somewhat reduced relative to wt. Introduction of G47A, E112K, or T196K in the A4 background in each case suppressed the increased ratio of genomic to sg mRNA that was characteristic for the parental mutant virus (Fig. 7D). Thus, both the pronounced mRNA-specific accumulation defects, as well as the associated drop in virus production observed for the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants (Fig. 4) were considerably alleviated by second-site mutations in nsp1. The location of both the original and the second-site mutations in nsp1 revealed multiple genetic interactions between all nsp1 subdomains that are important for the protein's role in regulating the relative abundance of EAV mRNAs. In addition, the increased virus production by the pseudorevertants was invariably correlated with a distinct shift towards an mRNA accumulation profile that was (more) similar to wt (Fig. 7, B and D). These observations provide compelling evidence that efficient virus production depends on maintaining \u201cbalanced\u201d viral mRNA levels in EAV-infected cells.",

This study extended and refined the above concept showing, first, that the functional repertoire of nsp1 also includes the differential control of mRNA accumulation, and, second, that some functions may be based on the interplay between two or even all three of the protein's subdomains. The phenotypes observed upon replacing charged amino acid clusters with alanine established the importance of all nsp1 subdomains for sg mRNA accumulation (Fig. 3A). The involvement of PCP\u03b2 in transcription is seemingly unrelated to its autoproteolytic function, whose inactivation is detrimental to genome replication [14]. The co-translational, cis-cleavage of the nsp1/2 site in the nascent replicase polyproteins [30] is probably the sole processing step mediated by PCP\u03b2, which becomes rapidly available to exercise any trans-acting, non-proteolytic activities it may have. Such secondary non-proteolytic functions have previously been reported for several +RNA viral autoproteinase domains, such as those of hepatitis C virus NS2 [31] and beet yellow virus L-Pro [32].",

Likewise, it works in concert with both flanking nsp1 subdomains in controlling the relative abundance of viral mRNAs (Fig. 4, Table 3, and Fig. 7). The Lys and Arg residues replaced with alanine in the A1 and A4 mutants, and the Lys that had evolved in their pseudorevertants are all basic residues. They are found in different nsp1 subdomains, but could well be spatially juxtaposed to provide a positively charged side chain to a functional region that is involved in interactions essential for one or more of the protein's activities. The Gly-47 to Ala reversion, which maps to the junction region between the ZF and PCP\u03b1, might serve to reposition these subdomains relative to each other. A similar readjustment of the protein's tertiary structure might account for the compensatory effect exerted by the Ala-29 to Asp reversion on the ZCH mutant. Despite the fact that its orthologs in other arteriviruses have retained their proteolytic activity, it is tempting to speculate that the incorporation of the PCP\u00e1 domain in the arterivirus nsp1 region can be primarily attributed to the non-proteolytic functions outlined above. On the whole, there seems to be considerable cooperation between nsp1 subdomains. This interplay appears crucial for coupling the different processes that nsp1 controls and may be based on interactions that are either intra- or intermolecular, in view of the protein's ability to form homo-oligomers [33]. Notably, a recent paper describing the crystal structure of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1, an arterivirus ortholog of the EAV ZF and PCP\u03b1 domains, reported that the protein exists in equilibrium between monomers and dimers in solution. Residues from both subdomains also contribute both to nsp1\u03b1 dimerization and the formation of a hydrophilic groove at the dimer surface [16].",

By contrast, specific upregulation of most mRNAs was observed for both the ZCH and A4 mutants and the associated dramatic defects in virus production were surprising, also in view of the apparently undisturbed translation of viral mRNAs (Fig. 6A). In an attempt to quantify the relationship between virus yield and viral mRNA accumulation, we used the data sets of Fig. 4B, 7B, and 7D to calculate the mean relative mRNA accumulation for the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants, as well as their pseudorevertants. Plotting these values versus the corresponding infectivity titers (derived from Fig. 6B and Table 3) revealed efficient production of infectious progeny for viruses with mRNA accumulation that was close to that of the wt control or modestly decreased (Fig. 8A). In contrast, severely reduced virus yields were observed when viral mRNA accumulation was increased, as seen for the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants. This somewhat counterintuitive observation was rationalized by assessing the importance of the quantitative balance among EAV mRNA species for infectious virus production. In order to establish this relationship, for each mRNA species the absolute deviation of its relative accumulation from the mean of the complete nested set of mRNAs (Fig. 8A) was calculated. From these seven values, the mean (absolute) deviation was calculated for each mutant or pseudorevertant, and these values were also plotted against virus titers (Fig. 8B). By definition, the mean deviation is equal to zero for the wt virus, whose mRNA levels we refer to as \u201cbalanced\u201d. All nsp1 mutants and their pseudorevertants have mean deviations larger than zero and these values reflect the magnitude of imbalance of their mRNA accumulation profiles. Remarkably, the plot revealed that the data nicely fit (R2 = 0.95) a negative exponential regression between infectious virus yield and mRNA imbalance, which is depicted as a negative linear regression in the semi-logarithmic plot of Fig. 8B. This strong relationship underlines that the magnitude of imbalance between different mRNA species, rather than the accumulation levels of mRNA species per se, is a chief factor affecting progeny yield. It should be noted that several factors may have affected our analysis of this relationship to a certain extent. For example, only a relatively small variety of nsp1 mutants and pseudorevertants was analyzed and although some pseudorevertants were recovered repeatedly, they were plotted only once. Also, the rapid emergence of pseudorevertants likely contributed to the virus titers measured for the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants a 24 h post transfection, which would thus be overestimated in our analysis. Therefore, an extension of this study with new mutants and pseudorevertants may further refine the relationship illustrated by Fig. 8B. It would also be interesting to evaluate how virus yields are affected by a general imbalance between replication and transcription (A4 mutant) versus sg mRNA-specific changes (ZCH mutant), although the latter seem to have an added negative effect (A1 mutant).",

The observation that increased production of infectious progeny by the nsp1 pseudorevertants invariably correlated with restoration of balanced viral mRNA accumulation (Table 3 and Fig. 7) lends further support to this hypothesis. Differential changes in structural protein levels might adversely affect their ability to form complexes that drive particle assembly, or alter the stoichiometry of these complexes when incorporated in virions. The latter option is consistent with the observed decrease in relative specific infectivity of virion preparations from the ZCH, A1, and A4 mutants (Table 2). Detailed information on the architecture of EAV virions and the molecular interactions among EAV structural proteins that drive virus assembly is unfortunately lacking. Nevertheless, our data clearly establish a previously unknown link between balanced EAV mRNA accumulation and efficient virus production. We thus conclude that nsp1 critically promotes virion biogenesis by modulating viral mRNA accumulation, as well as acting at an additional, currently unknown step of the EAV replicative cycle, downstream of viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 3; [14])",

Virtually nothing is known about the temporal coordination of these distinct processes in the nidovirus replicative cycle. Non-structural protein expression is extensively regulated at the translational and post-translational level, by ribosomal frame-shifting and concerted autoproteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins, which together control the production of the core viral replicative enzymes [18],[19],[34],[35]. By contrast, regulation of structural protein expression is presumed to occur mainly at the transcriptional level, although the exact significance and control of the relative abundance of the various viral mRNAs in infected cells had not been examined for any nidovirus. Prior studies [13],[14], together with our present findings, clearly implicate EAV nsp1 in controlling the balance between replication and transcription (Fig. 3 and 4). Mutations in nsp1 were previously shown to selectively block or equally reduce the accumulation of all sg mRNA species. The pronounced upregulation of genomic RNA levels in nsp1 mutants with a complete block in sg mRNA production was also described before [14] and suggested to result from redirecting a limited pool of RNA-synthesizing complexes, normally engaged in both replication and transcription, to the exclusive amplification of the viral genome.",

            "text": "Some of the mutant phenotypes in this report, however, are poorly compatible with the above scenario. Genome RNA levels were increased 4\u20136 fold in the A1 and A4 mutants, for which sg mRNAs synthesis was clearly detectable and even enhanced (Fig. 4). In addition, the ZCH and A1 mutations differentially modulated the accumulation levels of a specific subset of sg mRNAs and their subgenome-length minus-strand templates (Fig. 4 and 5). This effect was accompanied by unchanged genome RNA levels in the ZCH mutant. Taken together, these data imply that nsp1 does not only allow the viral RdRp complex to engage in discontinuous minus-strand synthesis, but also enables it to differentiate between the various body TRS motifs it encounters while traversing the genomic template. This occurs by a currently unknown mechanism that is different from the previously described \u201cpolar attenuation\u201d caused by the relative position of body TRSs in the array of successive attenuation signals that need to be \u201covercome\u201d by the minus-strand RNA-synthesizing complex [36]. The changes in viral RNA accumulation observed for the A1 and A4 mutants could result from partial loss of recruitment of nsp1 to the RdRp complex, or its compromised ability to recognize RNA signals that direct discontinuous RNA synthesis. Viral RNA synthesis would then be shifted towards replication, but the increased availability of template and/or viral enzymes that this causes (Fig. 4B and 6A) might account for the relatively high levels of sg mRNA accumulation in these two mutants. This, in turn, would imply that the availability of nsp1 is important for its function in transcription. Indeed, the intracellular distribution of nsp1 is distinct from that of the other EAV nsps \u2013 a large fraction of the protein is present in the host cell nucleus [33], while only \u223c25% of the cytoplasmic nsp1 fraction co-sediments with the membrane-bound viral RNA-synthesizing complexes upon their isolation from infected cells [37]. Immunofluorescence analysis did not reveal a significant change in intracellular nsp1 distribution for any of the mutants we described here (data not shown), but more rigorous biochemical studies are needed to ascertain the recruitment of nsp1 to RdRp complexes is completely unchanged. Nsp1 mutations clearly influenced minus-strand RNA accumulation (Fig. 5), although we cannot formally exclude that the protein controls minus-strand RNA stability rather than synthesis. Unfortunately, analysis of the kinetics of minus-strand accumulation in the ZCH and A1 mutants was hampered by the rapid emergence of pseudorevertants (Fig. 6B; Table 3) and the low abundance of these molecules at earlier time points post-transfection, which precluded their accurate quantitation (data not shown). Resolving this issue thus remains a formidable technical challenge. The recently described protocols for isolation of active viral RNA-synthesizing complexes from EAV-infected cells [37], as well as in vitro activity assays using a recombinant form of the EAV RdRp [38] might provide better platforms for future research on the mechanistic aspects of nsp1 function.",

            "text": "Nsp1 remains the only known arterivirus protein specifically implicated in the regulation of transcription [13],[39] and, to date, a functional counterpart has not been identified in coronaviruses or other nidoviruses. Species-specific changes in viral mRNA abundance were observed upon inactivation of the nsp14 exoribonuclease of human coronavirus 229E [40]. However, the major effect of this mutation was a reduction of the accumulation of all viral mRNAs by more than 100-fold. In view of the (indirect) dependence of transcription on genome replication and translation, the phenotype of the nsp14 mutants should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, a potential specific role of the coronavirus exonuclease in sg mRNA transcription deserves further investigation, although its analysis may be complicated by the multifunctionality of this protein, which was implicated in improving the fidelity of viral RNA synthesis [41],[42] and also includes an N7-methyltransferase domain [43]. Elegant studies of the tombusvirus replicase have shown that genome replication and sg mRNA synthesis can be effectively uncoupled by mutations in the C-terminus of the viral RdRp, which could only be achieved after separation of the protein-coding sequence from overlapping regulatory RNA sequences [44]. This example once again underlines the theoretical and technical challenges encountered while dissecting the complex mechanisms coordinating +RNA virus replication and transcription.",

From these seven values, the mean (absolute) deviation was calculated for each mutant and plotted against virus titers as in (A). For wt, the mean deviation is 0. Engineered nsp1 mutants and their pseudorevertants are indicated as in (A). The data fit a negative exponential regression calculated using Microsoft Excel and depicted as a gray line (y = 6\u00d7106+7e\u22128.4306x, R2 = 0.95). The inset shows an expanded view of the upper left quadrant of the graph (shaded in gray).",
