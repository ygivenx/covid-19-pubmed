Chickens, ducks, and geese are mostly traded alive because of cultural and religious preference for consuming freshly slaughtered poultry and the lack of refrigeration, particularly among rural households13. Local assembly traders purchase poultry from backyard and small producers in peripheral rural markets and sell them to distributors. Poultry are then transported to poultry wholesalers in districts or cities, where they are, in turn, purchased by poultry vendors. This process of poultry trading from purchase at the farm to purchase by the consumer usually takes 1\u20132 days13. At district and city markets, multiple species of birds were sold daily, and the vendors keep the birds until they are sold, creating opportunities for mixing unsold poultry with the fresh batch brought to the markets14.",

Influenza A virus prevalence varied from 3% [95% CI: 1.9\u20135.3%] to 5% [95% CI: 3.7\u20136.2%] depending on the market and ranged from 0.5% to 3% for influenza A/H5 viruses with the highest percentage observed at Chittagong (Fig. 1). Besides influenza A/H5 viruses, we also identified H1 (n = 6, 0.1%), H3 (n = 9, 0.2%), H4 (n = 8, 0.2%), H6 (n = 2, 0.001%), H9 (n = 9, 0.2%), and H11 (n = 10, 0.2%) among the influenza A positive waterfowl samples (Fig. 2, Appendix - Table 1). Hemagglutinin type for the remaining influenza A positive samples (38%) were not determined due to inability to propagate virus, amplify genomic material by PCR, and/or co-detection of Newcastle Disease virus RNA. Compared to the samples collected from backyard raised waterfowl, the small-scale operation raised waterfowl had more influenza A virus detections in their samples (3.6% vs. 5.4%, P < 0.01). However, the backyard raised waterfowl samples yielded more diverse hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes (i.e. H1N1, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N1, H4N2, H4N6, H5N1, H5N2, H5Nx, H6N1, H9Nx, H11N2 and H11N3) compared to the viruses identified in the small scale raised waterfowl (i.e. H1N1, H1N3, H4N6 and H11N6).

The focus of the Gerloff, et al. 2016 was to describe the ecology and evolution of the low pathogenicity avian influenza A viruses in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2013. However, this report builds on the prior reporting and focuses on the epidemiology of both high and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses identified in the LBMs in Bangladesh from 2007 to 2012. The magnitude and variety of influenza viruses in domestic poultry is an economic, food security and health concern24\u201326. The circulation of influenza A viruses throughout the year could be due to poultry-to-poultry transmission leading to entry into the poultry marketing chain and subsequent spread of disease at a national scale. It is also likely that substantial numbers of avian influenza infected poultry continuously enter the poultry marketing chain and serve as a source of infection for poultry kept in the urban live bird markets. Avian influenza circulation in the urban live bird markets could become sustained as urban live bird market closures and cleaning are not routinely practiced in Bangladesh27. The unsold birds and their excreta are likely in contact with uninfected birds brought in to the pool of susceptible birds in the markets and might maintain influenza viruses in the live bird markets.",

Although a previous study reported very limited circulation of H5N1 in the live bird markets in Bangladesh21, we frequently identified the subtype in waterfowl brought into the markets. The majority of the H5N1 subtypes identified in our surveillance were circulating in domestic ducks, which in most cases, did not exhibit clinical illness. This finding is supported by several studies showing that ducks that carry influenza A viruses, including HPAI H5N1 virus, demonstrate very limited clinical signs or remain asymptomatic and shed the virus in feces and respiratory droplets15,16,29,30.",

Poultry in larger-sized flocks (>20 birds) usually belonged to small-scale poultry operations; mostly consisting of free-ranging ducks raised for egg production that roam in rivers and other water bodies such as ponds, ditches, other wetlands and rice fields. These birds might acquire influenza A viruses through ingestion of water contaminated by other free ranging waterfowl34. Our multivariate analysis suggested that it was less likely to identify H5N1 infected waterfowl in the birds belonging to a larger flock size (>20) (Table 2). A study on similar (small scale) waterfowl operations examined egg yolk and found 24% of the samples had antibodies against H5N1, whereas fecal samples yielded very little evidence of active shedding of the virus34. Since most of the waterfowl from small scale operations were brought to the market after the end of the egg laying cycle, it is likely that we might have missed their active virus shedding period. Although the samples from small scale raised flocks had more influenza A viruses detections, the backyard raised flocks yielded more diverse subtypes, which might be explained by the diversity of exposure (both the environment and the commercial poultry marketing chain) to the backyard poultry enabling them to contract a variety of influenza A subtypes.",

It is likely the clade 2.3.2.1a virus was either introduced to a completely naive waterfowl population or the new clade was highly virulent for the waterfowl population35,36. Our surveillance identified an influx of H5N1 detections right after the introduction of clade 2.3.2.1a in early 2011. This clade also likely replaced the previously circulating clade 2.2.2 (Figs 2 and 3)37. Clade 2.3.2.1a was considered to be one of the several invasive clades of H5N1 virus because of its ability to maintain efficient transmission within multiple species of poultry and wild birds and, subsequently, spread over a large geographic area38. Since the first reports of clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 outbreaks in a common magpie in Hong Kong SAR in 2007, the virus continued to cause infection in domestic poultry and wild birds in multiple countries of Asia and Europe in recent years39,40. Previous studies have suggested that because clade 2.3.4.2 viruses were only found in domestic chickens that they might have been introduced through poultry trade. Since 2011, the viruses detected in Bangladesh were derived from clade 2.3.2.1, but not from 2.3.4.2 suggesting a lack of sustained circulation of this genetic group of H5N1 viruses in Bangladesh41.",

We identified more avian influenza A viruses occurring in colder months (October-March) (Appendix - Fig. 3). However, we were unable to identify any distinct seasonality for H5N1 virus occurrences (Appendix - Fig. 4). Reports from other countries in Asia observed a distinct seasonal pattern of H5N1 occurrence that peaked during autumn and winter months, demonstrating a strong tie between environmental factors and the occurrence of avian influenza in poultry42,43. In Bangladesh, it appears that anthropogenic factors, such as live bird markets and poultry marketing chains might contribute to the introduction of H5N1 infected poultry to the domestic poultry population throughout the year. Although the live bird market closure could be an intervention to interrupt transmission of avian influenza A viruses within the dynamic poultry population maintained within the marketing chain44, such interventions are seldom practiced in the urban live bird markets in Bangladesh. The circulation of H5N1 viruses throughout the year also leads to the possibility of co-circulation, co-infection and reassortment within the human and bird population42. Perhaps the currently ongoing avian influenza virus surveillance among live bird market poultry workers45 might help us better understand co-seasonality in humans and birds; if and when the virus co-infects, reassorts, acquires capacity to infect humans and turns out to be a public health concern.",

Identification of influenza viruses in market environmental samples highlights the persistence influenza viruses in the market environment throughout the year. Although rRT-PCR is unable to differentiate between presence of viable virus or only the viral nucleic acid, the steady identification in the market environment suggested sustained contamination of influenza A viruses through birds in the market chain. Through our surveillance and other studies in Asia, it is evident that multiple influenza A virus subtypes were simultaneously present in the live bird markets1,8,10,47 and there were chances that the birds brought to the market could be co-infected with multiple subtypes and clades. Co-infection of multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses within a host may result in the generation of a reassortant progeny as they are able to exchange their genetic material during the replication process48. The samples that we collected from individual birds did not identify more than one subtype co-infecting a waterfowl. While we did not identify an event of co-infection in the market waterfowl samples, a separate phylogenetic analysis of the H5N1 isolates identified from our surveillance demonstrated that the viruses reassorted within the same clade of H5N1, between different clades of H5N1, and between low pathogenic viruses (H9N2)41.",

The team approached owners of waterfowl to ask if they would be willing to let us sample their birds. Depending on the availability of birds, we sampled no more than four waterfowl per owner for a total of 20 waterfowl per market day. The team collected one of the following three types of samples from waterfowl: cloacal swab, swabs from freshly laid feces, or oropharyngeal swabs. Whenever we identified a waterfowl showing signs of respiratory disease, such as ocular or nasal discharge or swollen infraorbital sinuses, we collected an oropharyngeal swab. We rarely identified dead waterfowl in the live bird markets. When we did identify them, we collected a swab sample from the dead waterfowl following the procedure described earlier. The team followed WHO guidelines for sample collection and preservation58.",

Initial screening for influenza A virus, H5, or H9 was performed at icddr,b by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). An aliquot of each LBM sample that tested positive for influenza A virus by rRT-PCR was sent to CDC, and tested again initially against a panel of 5 different targets including influenza A virus, subtypes H5, H7, H9 and Newcastle disease virus60. Influenza A positive specimens negative for H5, H7 and H9 were further characterized by rRT-PCR using subtype specific primers to detect H1 and H341. Samples with influenza A matrix gene ct values less than 30 were inoculated into 10\u201311 day old embryonated chicken eggs and allantoic fluid was harvested at either 24 (H5N1 virus) or 48 hours post-inoculation prior to testing by hemagglutination with turkey red blood cells to detected presence of virus61. The HA and NA genes of H5, H7 and H9-positive isolates were Sanger sequenced using subtype-specific primers. Influenza A positive (H5, H7 and H9 negative) samples that yielded virus isolates were subjected to a previously described multiplex PCR subtyping assay followed by HA and NA sequencing using subtype-specific primers62. We also tested the influenza A positive samples for the presence of Newcastle disease virus RNA, and excluded Newcastle disease virus positive samples from virus culture procedure63.",

We used the bivariate X2 tests of independence to assess the association between frequencies of the identifying influenza A virus and dichotomous clinical, demographic and farming variables. We estimated odds ratios (OR) with robust confidence intervals (CI) for the association between different potential exposures and harboring influenza A viruses and influenza A/H5 virus; these included occurrence of influenza A and influenza A/H5 viruses during October-March and April-September the colder and warmer months of the year64; poultry flock size above and below 20 birds (upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the mean of the backyard raised poultry flocks); poultry mortality in flocks seven days preceding the sampling; species and age of the sampled waterfowl; and their health status during sampling. Variables that were statistically associated with influenza A or influenza A/H5 (p < 0.2) in the bivariate X2 tests of independence analysis, were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model to determine the association with the outcome (i.e. influenza A or influenza A/H5 test positive) and adjusted for confounding effects (i.e. age, bird type, raising pattern) and reported the adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI. Since the bird samples were from surrounding regions of the selected live bird markets, and sometimes, multiple samples were collected from a flock, we calculated robust confidence interval to guard against overestimation of the precision in estimates. We performed backward elimination and covariates with p < 0.05 were retained in the model. Using bivariate X2 tests, we assessed collinearity for the predictors retained in the final model. Finally, we performed Hosmer-Lemeshow X2 statistics65 for goodness-of-fit. We used Seasonal-Trend Decomposition method based on locally weighted regression, as a filtering procedure to decompose monthly influenza A and influenza A/H5 occurrence time series data in to trends, seasonal and reminder components66 to understand seasonality and trends of the influenza viruses in the poultry brought to the live bird markets. The figures with maps were generated using ArcGIS version 10.4 (http://arcgis.com/).
