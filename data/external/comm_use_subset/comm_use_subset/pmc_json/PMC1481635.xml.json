            "text": "Antiviral drugs against influenza virus play an important role in the treatment and prevention of human influenza infection. The adamantanes have been used for decades and resistance to this class of drugs has become prevalent in some parts of the world [1]. The neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir, is currently regarded as the first line of defence against a pandemic until a suitable vaccine can be produced in sufficient quantities. Emergence of resistance to this drug in human influenza A viruses [2], as well as the H5N1 subtype in Vietnam [3] is thus a cause for concern. Resistance has not been reported for zanamivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor [4]. Expanding the range of antiviral drugs that effectively inhibit influenza A virus replication is thus a matter of urgency.",

As a lysosomotropic weak base, it impairs replication of some viruses through reducing the efficiency of endosome-mediated virus entry or through inhibiting the low-pH dependent proteases in trans-Golgi vesicles [5]. Its antiviral activities against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [6] and the SARS coronavirus have been demonstrated [7,8]. Previously, chloroquine had been used to study influenza virus replication in vitro [9]. However, the 0.1 mM concentration used was too high to indicate its therapeutic usefulness [9]. We thus carried out an in vitro antiviral assay to determine the 50% and 90% inhibitory concentration (IC50 and IC90, respectively) of chloroquine against influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2.",

Influenza A viruses H1N1 (ATCC: VR1520) and H3N2 (ATCC: VR544) were used in this study. Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of serial 2-fold dilutions of the chloroquine were incubated overnight with 100 \u03bcl of MDCK cells giving a final cell count of 30,000 cells per well in a 96-well microtitre plate (Nunc A/S Roskilde, Denmark), for the drug to equilibrate with the cells. 50 \u03bcl of virus at a concentration of 100 50% tissue culture infectivity dose (TCID50) was added to each well and the plate incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 2 days. Viral replication was assessed by 2 methods: real-time RT-PCR using a previously described protocol [11] was carried out on nucleic acid extracted from the supernatant of the culture, using the Roche Lightcycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany); FITC-labeled anti-nucleoprotein monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was used to stain the remaining cell monolayer and viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope. Controls consisting of virus and cell only, cell only, virus only and serial 2-fold dilution of amantadine in place of chloroquine were included in each plate. Cytotoxicity of the drugs was also assessed at all concentrations used in the antiviral assay.",

Complete inhibition of influenza A virus H1N1 and H3N2 replication was observed at 12.5 \u03bcM chloroquine. This was evident microscopically with the absence of immunofluorescent focus as well as a similar Ct value on real-time RT-PCR as the virus only control. The number of fluorescent foci increased with decreasing concentration of chloroquine and this is similarly reflected in the decrease in Ct value of the real time RT-PCR of their respective supernatant. The IC50 and IC90 of chloroquine against H1N1 are 3.6 \u03bcM and 9.9 \u03bcM, respectively, while those for H3N2 are 0.84 \u03bcM and 2.4 \u03bcM, respectively.",

Although new compounds are still being developed and their anti-influenza activity assessed, these may take years to fulfill the regulatory requirements before clinical use can be initiated. An alternative to this mode of drug discovery may be to find new uses for old drugs, where the availability of extensive experience with their clinical use may shorten the duration needed for the various phases of clinical trials. Chloroquine serves as such an example. Our results suggest that chloroquine has a clinically useful inhibitory activity against influenza A virus replication.",
