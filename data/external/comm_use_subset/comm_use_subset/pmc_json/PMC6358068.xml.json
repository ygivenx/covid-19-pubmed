For this purpose, it would be expected that recombinant antigens were more specific than natural ones, but several studies have shown just the contrary [1\u20134]. Although this phenomenon has not yet been investigated in detail, some reports pointed out that the presence of contaminants derived from the expression of His-tagged proteins in E. coli may explain the poor specificity of such antigens [5]. Optimized E. coli expression [6], acidic washes [7,8], and washing with low amounts of imidazole [9] are methods commonly used to prevent the co-purification of proteins on immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), thus improving the purity of His-tagged recombinant proteins. Also, disulfide bond formation between the protein of interest and other proteins, as well as nonspecific hydrophobic interactions, can be minimized by inclusion of 2-mercaptoethanol and non-ionic detergents, respectively, in the loading buffer [8]. However, since a relevant fraction of contaminant E. coli proteins exhibit moderate to strong affinity for metal-chelating resins [9], these methods do not guarantee complete purity of recombinant proteins and may decrease the yield of the purified protein.",

            "text": "Another way to overcome the above problems is grafting a second linear epitope tag recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) into the target sequence of interest, thus allowing re-purification of the protein by affinity chromatography. Currently there are some proprietary tag-mAb pairs that can be used for affinity-purification and for detection of tagged recombinant proteins [10,11]. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them were used to develop sandwich ELISA methods for serodiagnosis of infectious diseases, a strategy that, if successful, would allow recapturing of the refolded antigen of interest in a single step. To explore this methodology, in the present study we grafted the linear sequence MTFSVPIS, located at the amino terminal region of the gp53 antigen from encapsulated species of Trichinella and recognized by the IgG1/\u03ba mAb US9 [12\u201314], into a His-tagged Fasciola hepatica recombinant protein (leucine aminopeptidase; FhLAP). FhLAP is a cytoplasmic metalloproteinase isolated from adult flukes [15], which was reported to be able to induce specific antibodies during infection as well as partial protection against reinfection in immunized sheep [16\u201318]. Although native [19\u201321] and recombinant [4,22,23] Fasciola cathepsins (clades L1, L2 and/or L5) are more adequate as target antigens in ELISA for immunodiagnosis of human and animal infections, for the proof of concept of the present study, we preferred FhLAP since it can be expressed soluble in transformed E. coli and, consequently, undesirable host proteins are more prone to be present. Moreover, since native FhLAP was previously tested as target antigen for immunodiagnosis of human fascioliasis, this study provides us with the opportunity to evaluate its usefulness to diagnose F. hepatica infections in domestic ruminants (sheep and cattle).",

The flukes were then transferred to 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and maintained in culture medium (3 mL/fluke) at 38\u00b0C under 5% CO2 in air. After 24 h incubation, the medium containing the secreted antigens was removed and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C in the presence of protease inhibitors (SigmaFast Protease Inhibitor Tablets, Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain). The supernatant was then passed through a 0.45-\u03bcm pore filter disk, concentrated in an Amicon 8050 ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) equipped with a YM10 membrane (10 kDa molecular weight cut-off), dialyzed against PBS, sterilized by filtration and, finally, stored at -80\u00b0C until required. The protein concentration was measured using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Barcelona, Spain).",

Also, several minor bands of different MW (lane 3) can be observed, which probably correspond to truncated proteins and/or E. coli contaminants copurified during the IMAC procedure. The presence of rUS9-FhLAP truncates could be confirmed in WB revealing the proteins with mAb US9 (lane 4) and a mAb recognizing the poly-His tag (Fig 2A, lane 5).

Then, the eluted protein fraction was used as target antigen in indirect ELISA to investigate whether it is recognized by sera from non-infected cattle (Fig 7B). The results in Fig 7 clearly showed that: i) a broad MW range (10\u2013200 kDa) of soluble proteins from non-transformed M15 E. coli bond to the IMAC column (Fig 7A), ii) these proteins are recognized in indirect ELISA by sera from non-infected cattle (mean OD = 0.17\u00b10.08SD; OD range: 0.07\u20130.47), and iii) the reactivity observed in indirect ELISA testing sera from non-infected cattle (n = 35) significantly correlated (R2 = 0.42; p<0.0001) with that obtained using IMAC-purified rUS9-FhLAP (Fig 7B). These data, together with the fact that the IMAC-purified M15 protein fraction was able to inhibit 50\u201370% of the reactivity of selected sera from non-infected cattle in an indirect ELISA with rUS9-FhLAP (not showed), clearly indicates that native E. coli proteins bind and co-elute with recombinant proteins during IMAC purification, and thus constitute a relevant source of non-specific binding by natural antibodies present in sera from cattle. Moreover, since such reactivity was not observed when testing the same sera in WB (not showed), it seems that the target of cattle antibodies are mainly conformational epitopes.",

This strategy allows rapid affinity-purification of recombinant proteins, but it can also be used for protein detection in WB, flow cytometry and ELISA [39]. Typically, epitope tags (commonly, 5\u201316 residues in length) are selected among linear sequences [10,40] and have a negative GRAVY index (i.e., hydrophilic) assuming that hydrophilic tags are exposed at the surface and thus are more accessible to antibodies. Also, in most studies tags have been placed at the amino or carboxy terminal regions in the belief that the loss of function will be minimal, although this is not a general rule applicable to any protein (reviewed in [37]).",

While the classical 6XHis is the most commonly used tag for single-step purification of recombinant proteins, allowing purities of up to 95% with 90% recovery of the tagged protein [8], the remaining contaminants may be of great importance when these antigens are used as target in immunodiagnosis or in any other situation where a homogeneous product is required. The advantage of using a dual tag could be evidenced in our study, in which the rUS9-FhLAP purified in a single step by IMAC showed strong reactivity in indirect ELISA with many sera from non-infected ruminants (mainly from cattle), but disappeared when these antigens were re-purified by mAb US9 in capture ELISA. Typical metal-binding contaminants during IMAC purifications include non-protein components (e.g., phospholipids, nucleic acids and LPS), but also host cell proteins like outer membrane proteins, stress-responsive proteins (folding machinery) and ribosomal subunit proteins [41], some of which require more than 80 mM imidazole for elution [9].",

Likewise, a great diversity of E. coli proteins with affinity for Ni(II) ions was also observed among soluble proteins obtained from non-transformed M15 cells (Fig 7A) using PBS plus 5mM imidazole as loading and washing buffer. It is also noticeable that false positive results using IMAC-purified recombinant proteins is not limited to the rUS9-FhLAP antigen of present study, as similar observations were also reported using the more antigenic Fasciola recombinant cathepsins L as target in ELISA after expression in Pichia pastoris and further purification by IMAC [2]. Moreover, recent studies in our laboratory showed that the number of false positives was less relevant when the antigens (procathepsins L) were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, as these aggregates are first washed by centrifugation and most of contaminant host soluble proteins are eliminated prior to denaturation and IMAC affinity-purification [4].",

Nevertheless, it should be underlined that its insertion into the rFhLAP sequence was performed in tandem after the 6XHis tag and that 5 additional residues were also incorporated into the amino terminal region due to the cloning procedure. Consequently, twenty extra residues were incorporated into the amino region of the rFhLAP sequence (1MRGSHHHHHHGSMTFSVPIS20) with a GRAVY = -0.735, which is in the range of many other epitope tags [10]. It is also noticeable that the US9 epitope in the chimeric rUS9-FhLAP has a similar position as in the parental mature sequence of gp53 from T. spiralis (1STDNENVAMKEMTFSVPIS19, GRAVY = -0.289; gb|CAD86781.1) and T. britovi (1STDNENAAMKEMTFSVPIS19, GRAVY = -0.416; gb|CAD86782.1) [13], which anticipated the good recognition of rUS9-FhLAP by mAb US9. Moreover, the presence of GS dipeptides before the 6XHis and the US9 epitope probably also facilitates the recognition by mAb US9, as \u201cGS\u201d linkers are commonly used as flexible linkers to engineer recombinant fusion proteins [45,46] and to link epitopes within chimeric multiepitope recombinant antigens [47,48]. Finally, it should also be considered that, although the MTFSVPIS sequence belongs to a nematode protein, its recognition by sera from infected animals in capture ELISA is not possible since such epitope is not available after binding to the capture antibody (US9).",

This strategy may be advantageous over indirect ELISAs by at least two reasons: i) unlike in indirect ELISA, all antigen molecules remain oriented in the space by action of the capture mAb, and ii) an individual control, i.e., a well containing mAb molecules and the blocking protein, can be used for each serum, thus improving detection of individuals having antibodies reacting with either the capture mAb or the proteins used to block the ELISA plates [34]. Further studies are being carried out in our laboratory to investigate if the same strategy can be performed with other Fasciola antigens, such as whole or selected fragments of cathepsins L, to develop robust immunodiagnostic tests without the necessity of obtaining live parasites in abattoirs.",
