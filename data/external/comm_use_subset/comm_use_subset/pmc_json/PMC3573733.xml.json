            "text": "It is estimated that approximately 180 million people have been infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and approximately 130 million people are chronic HCV carriers (1). HCV is a common cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (2\u20134). Currently, there are two main methods for detecting an HCV infection: one detects viral RNA by RT-PCR (5\u20138) and the other detects HCV antibodies by immunoassay [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] in serum (9,10). The sensitive ELISA assay uses recombinant viral proteins corresponding to multiple polypeptides from different viral regions, including structural proteins and non-structural polypeptides (11\u201313). It can be used as a confirmation test. However, its usage is limited in the clinical setting as the procedure requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and there is a high probability of contamination. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to develop an affordable and reliable rapid lateral flow test to detect the presence of HCV antibodies in blood samples by screening for HCV antigens, which would help decrease the chances of HCV infection from blood transfusions.",

First, we optimized the conditions for the colloidal gold conjugation of the purified antigen and the coating of the gold-conjugated recombinant protein on non-woven fabric sheets. Colloidal gold is used as an indicator for the presence of antigens binding to the membrane on the rapid lateral flow test strip. After the proteins are bound to colloidal gold to form the conjugate, the fabric sheets are placed in a dry room for at least 2 h for drying. Subsequently, the purified antigen, diluted in PBS, is coated on the test region. Simultaneously, HCV IgG polyclonal antibody, diluted in PBS, is coated on the control region. The coated membrane is dried for a minimum of 24 h and then blocked with a particular blocking solution. Finally, the test strip is assembled such that everything slightly overlaps in order to allow for the continuous lateral flow of the liquid sample. The test strip has an absorption pad, a strip of membrane, a conjugate fibre and other fibres to hold the conjugate fibre in place. Instructions on how to assemble a test strip were provided by Artron BioResearch Inc. The combination of the coating protein, conjugate protein, conjugate fibre and dialysis buffer forms a \u2018system\u2019 in a test strip.

Of the 23 standard positive sera (derived from confirmed HCV RNA and antibody-positive patients), 95.6% recognized the core and 95.6% recognized the NS3 protein. The remaining HCV proteins were very poorly immunogenic. Only three serum specimens recognized the NS5B protein and none of the sera recognized the NS2 protein.The results showed that the core and NS3 [1183\u20131476 amino acids (aa)] of the HCV polyprotein had strong positive reactions to positive sera. However, the core and NS3 (1183\u20131476 aa) each had one false-negative result when testing the positive control samples. Thus, we combined the core and NS3 (1183\u20131476 aa) as the coating antigen of the new DAS-LFIA strip. Our data suggested that the new DAS-LFIA strip was able to detect HCV antibodies at high positive rates (100%) when compared with the ELISA, I-LFIA and RT-PCR methods using the same serum samples (Table III) (P>0.05). In this model of HCV infection, the test line of the anti-HCV DAS-LFIA strip was 2 NCU/ml (Table IV). All antigens ran against negative samples did not show any signs of reactivity in comparison to the control test strip (Fig. 4). This indicated that the HCV antigen did not cross-react with other common viral antibodies and thus, was highly specific to HCV.",

The purpose of synthesizing these segments is to determine which segments encoded by the genome are significant for the development of anti-HCV assays and to find a multiple epitope fusion antigen which incorporates all of the major immunodominant epitopes from the functional regions of the HCV genome. Therefore, we first constructed the different HCV segments into vectors containing His-tag or GST-tag to induce expression. The proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells as fusion proteins with a 26 kDa GST-tag or 18 kDa His-tag used for detection and affinity purification. The immunogenicity of the tagged fusion proteins was analyzed using HCV strip analysis with standard positive and negative anti-HCV sera. Our results showed that the recombinant soluble proteins were expressed successfully. The sera studied recognized the core and NS3 protein at very high levels, whereas the other proteins, such as NS4B, NS4A, NS5A and NS5B, were found to have lower levels of reactivity. The E2 protein rarely reacted with anti-HCV positive serum. Thus, the core protein in combination with a new NS3 protein (1183\u20131476 aa) constitutes almost all of the major immunogenic proteins of the HCV. However, this study does not exclude the possibility that the low reactivity to some HCV antigens is due to a quantitative reduction in the titer of antibodies and not due to an absence of reactivity.",

The data suggested that the full-length core protein and the new NS3 protein (1183\u20131476 aa) were suitable for analyzing the presence of antibodies against individual HCV proteins in human sera obtained from patients suffering from chronic HCV infection.

The experimental results demonstrated that the chromatographic strip device we constructed is simple, sensitive and specific. It is an ideal test for the screening of patients with HCV infection.
