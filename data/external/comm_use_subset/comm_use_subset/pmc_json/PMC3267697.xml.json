These reports suggest that HBoV might be associated with upper and lower respiratory disease and gastrointestinal illness throughout the world.

Therefore, additional evidence and studies are needed throughout the world to gain a better understanding of this virus. In this study, 2811 respiratory samples were collected from patients (with an age range of 9 days to 84 years) with ARTI in Guangzhou, southern China, from November 2009 to November 2010 to analyze the characteristics of HBoV-positive patients.",

Primers and the probe were synthesized by TaKaRa. Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real Time) real-time PCR reaction buffer was also purchased from TaKaRa. Amplification was conducted using 10 pmol of primers, 3 pmol of probe and 5 \u03bcl DNA in a final volume of 25 \u03bcl. Cycling conditions included an initial incubation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 sec and 55\u00b0C for 35 sec (ABI-7500 real-time PCR instrument,Applied Biosystems). The amplified NP1 gene target sequence (2545-2611 nt) was inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and used as a positive control for quantification analysis.

However, most studies were focused on young children and infants [9-14], and only a few papers have described the characteristics of HBoV infection in adult patients [16,25,26]. Our study successfully analyzed the characteristics of HBoV-positive samples from ARTI-infected patients with a wide age distribution from Guangzhou, southern China for the first reported time. Similar to previous study [16], the detection rate in pediatric patients (<18 years old) was significantly higher than that in adults (\u226518 years old) (p < 0.001), and most HBoV-positive patients were \u22643 years old. HBoV was detected in four adult patients, including 60 and 70 year-old patients. This suggested that older people were also susceptive to HBoV infection, although at much lower positive rates. Four adult patients also presented with systemic influenza-like symptoms, which might suggest that HBoV infection in adults is a more complex and serious problem than in children.",

HBoV was confirmed in elderly patients (60 and 70 years old), suggesting that older people were also susceptive to HBoV. All four adult patients with HBoV positive in this study presented systemic influenza-like symptoms, which potentially suggest that HBoV infection in adults may develop more serious symptoms than those in children. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that HBoV-GU338055 from an elderly patient is in a single lineage with other HBoVs.",
