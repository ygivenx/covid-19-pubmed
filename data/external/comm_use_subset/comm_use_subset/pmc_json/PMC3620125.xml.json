In particular, there is no pre-existing vector immunity, construction and manufacturing is rapid, and candidate DNA vaccines have been extremely stable and safe [1]. However, DNA vaccine immunogenicity in humans has been less than expected from preclinical studies in mice and monkeys. The basis for this is not fully known, but it is likely that inefficient transfection, particularly through the plasma and nuclear membranes of host cells, is a major factor.",

A number of steps have been taken to optimize protein expression including codon modification, altered promoters, translation enhancer motifs, and other changes to the plasmid backbone [10]. A variety of doses have been explored, and early in the program a decision was made to use the needle-free Biojector\u00ae device based on published reports of Biojector\u00ae delivery improving the antibody response to DNA vaccines in animals [11] and humans [12], [13] compared to delivery by needle and syringe (N/S). In particular, vaccine studies for WNV [6], [8], influenza [9], and HIV [14]\u2013[17] have demonstrated favorable properties of DNA immunization that merit further development. Three doses of a WNV DNA vaccine expressing the prM and E proteins induced substantial neutralizing antibody responses comparable to those seen in horses known to be protected [6], [8]. In the influenza program, a single dose of H5 influenza HA DNA vaccine primed a four-fold increase in HAI antibody titers in >80% of subjects following a single 6 month boost with unadjuvanted inactivated H5N1 vaccine compared to 2 doses of inactivated H5N1 vaccine [9]. This concept is now being evaluated in Phase II studies using seasonal influenza vaccines. In the HIV vaccine development program, DNA primed broad and durable T cell responses and consistent antibody responses following boosting with rAd5 [15]\u2013[18]. This regimen is now being evaluated in the HVTN 505 Phase IIb test-of-concept study to determine efficacy. Given the progression of DNA vaccines into advanced clinical trials it is important to understand how delivery approaches may contribute to their immunogenicity.",

Randomization sequence was obtained by the statistician using computer-generated random numbers and was stratified by Ad5Ab titer as positive or negative to achieve balance across study groups. Within each stratum of Ad5Ab titer, five subjects were assigned to each combination of factors (DNA administration device and rAd5 booster dose) completely at random. The DNA administration device became known to both clinicians and subjects after completion of an electronic enrollment in the study database, while the dose of rAd5 vaccine remained blinded to all except the statistician and pharmacist until after the safety data collection following the rAd5 vaccine boost was completed.",

Local reactogenicity of the DNA injections was further documented by clinician assessments and photographs 3 days after injection. Laboratory and clinical follow-up continued through Week 42. The Division of AIDS 2004 table was used for grading severity of unsolicited adverse events (AEs), which were also coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) for preparing summary data. There were no significant changes to the study design after trial commencement except for the addition of a long-term contact at Week 94, as part of the response to comments made by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the protocol design. The study was fully accrued and completed as designed. The primary objective related to safety of the vaccination regimens and secondary objectives related to immune responses at 4 weeks after the 3rd DNA vaccine and 6 weeks after the rAd5 vaccine boost were the basis for the sample size.

            "text": "Historically, administration of injectable vaccines has been primarily accomplished with a needle and syringe (N/S). Mass production makes these supplies economical and they are a standard commodity in virtually all health care settings. There is little risk if sterile disposable supplies are used and disposed of properly, although at times, an acknowledged problem in some developing countries has been the reuse of non-sterile needles or syringes with transmission of blood-borne pathogens [26]. In all settings, the risk of needle-stick injuries and proper needle disposal remains a concern.",

            "text": "Needle-free injection systems are an alternative to N/S injections of vaccines. The Biojector\u00ae used in these studies ejects fluid through a small orifice under pressure to deliver liquid vaccines parenterally. While deposition may be controlled to be primarily intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous, or intradermal, IM injection delivers the injectate to all layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissues as it is propelled into muscle in a conical distribution. It has been speculated that needle-free injection devices may improve immunogenicity because of broader dispersion of the injectate than N/S [27]. A study in guinea pigs showed that Biojector\u00ae delivery compared to N/S increased the uptake of DNA plasmids in muscle and skin cells near the injection site [28]. Vaccine delivery with needle-free devices has also been reported to have an association with increased local inflammation and may enhance immunogenicity through recruitment of immunocompetent inflammatory cells [12], [13], [29]\u2013[32]. Although the basic mechanisms by which Biojector\u00ae delivery improves the potency of DNA vaccination are unknown, it is consistent with increased transfection frequency and greater antigen production. This could be related to the ballistic nature of the injection or due to the dispersal pattern that essentially increases the number of cells exposed to DNA molecules compared to needle injection in which much of the injectate pools in the needle track.",

It uses compressed helium to shoot nanoparticle-sized gold balls coated with DNA into the skin.

Biojector\u00ae is a hand-held, portable, easy to use, FDA-approved device for IM delivery of clinical products, including injections for children. Other approaches are being developed to improve DNA vaccine transfection efficiency.

Importantly, delivery of DNA vaccines by the needle-free Biojector\u00ae device was associated with improved antibody, IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot, and CD8+ T cell responses post boosting with rAd5. This was associated with subtle differences in CD4 and CD8 T cell responses post DNA priming that were significantly amplified post rAd5 boosting as previously reported [14].
