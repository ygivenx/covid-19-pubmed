            "text": "Despite recent advances in the development of new antiretrovirals, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to spread worldwide with an astonishing rate of approximately 5500 new infections a day [1]. HIV is a highly mutable virus and, thus, a major limitation of existing antiretrovirals is the ability of HIV to develop resistance under selective pressure from these drugs. This has led drug designers to opt for complementary combinations with high manufacturing costs, which makes delivery in resource-poor areas (where the disease burden is often highest) unfeasible [2]. Therefore, new, more efficient, and inexpensive antiviral drugs are needed in order to better combat HIV/AIDS. A few years ago, an anti-HIV bioassay guided fractionation of aqueous extracts of the red alga Griffithsia species collected from the waters off New Zealand lead to the discovery of a lectin termed Griffithsin (GRFT) [3]. Thanks to its pronounced anti-viral activity against both laboratory and primary isolates of HIV in the picomolar range, GRFT is considered a potential candidate microbicide to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and AIDS [3,4,5].",

            "text": "Binding of oligosaccharides to multiple sites on a single molecule of GRFT provides the basis for its potent antiviral properties [6], and it has been hypothesized that the lectin would inactivate other enveloped viruses, especially those with highly glycosylated proteins on their surface. Indeed, GRFT was recently shown to tightly bind at multiple sites to the spike glycoprotein found on the envelope of the coronavirus (CoV), the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7]. In the same work, a potent activity was reported for GRFT against a broad spectrum of coronaviruses in addition to its outstanding in vivo efficacy in SARS-CoV-infected mice [7]. More recently, GRFT was shown to inhibit Japanese encephalitis virus infection, both in vitro and in a mouse model of infection [8]. In addition, GRFT exhibits significant inhibitory activities on herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2, both in vitro and in a mouse model of genital herpes, and protects mice that harbor human primary hepatocytes in their liver from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [9,10,11]. GRFT is currently under development as a topical microbicide in our laboratory and others in order to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. The outcomes of recent clinical trials have highlighted the shortcomings of current preclinical safety assays for microbicide product development [12,13,14,15]. Interestingly, several studies have revealed that GRFT has an excellent safety profile in vitro, ex vivo using cervical explants, and in the rabbit vaginal irritation model, considered the gold standard of preclinical safety test for vaginal products [3,4,12,16]. Topical administration of GRFT is unlikely to result in the drug being present in the circulation. However, it is important to study systemic toxicity of microbicides in case of absorption after topical administration e.g., in patients with ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is also important to evaluate the systemic toxicity of GRFT should this lectin be used for the treatment of blood borne pathogenic enveloped viruses, including HCV, hepatitis B (HBV), Ebola, Marburg, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Importantly, we recently found that GRFT displays minimal toxicity in guinea pigs after chronic administration of 10 mg/kg daily subcutaneous doses [17].",

Our findings presented here corroborated our previous work using human PBMCs [12]. Then, we evaluated the toxicological properties of GRFT after parenteral administration of 50 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, of the drug in BALB/c mice. Only minimal toxicity was observed, even at these high doses. Finally, the effects of 2 mg/kg GRFT after intravaginal, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous administrations were evaluated. The latter dose reflects the amount of GRFT that would be mucosally administered in the context of microbicide application as demonstrated in HSV-2 efficacy studies [9]. Interestingly, no toxicities were observed in these experiments, indicating an excellent in vivo safety profile for GRFT in the murine model.",

In parallel, a higher single dose of 50 mg/kg GRFT was administered to 30 mice divided into three subgroups of 10 evaluated at one, seven, and 14 days post-treatment, respectively. As controls, three groups of five animals were treated with the vehicle PBS. Next, we studied the effects of GRFT after chronic administration. Here, two groups of 15 mice each were treated with 10 mg/kg GRFT or PBS on a daily basis for 14 days. Animals were sacrificed at Day 14 (nine mice per treatment group), Days 16 and 21 (three per treatment group at each time point, respectively). In all experiments, blood was collected immediately after euthanasia, and blood samples were submitted to complete blood count (CBC). In addition, plasma samples were evaluated for a panel of markers of organ toxicity, using blood chemistry techniques. After euthanasia, spleens, lungs, kidneys, livers, and hearts were extracted and weighed. In the case of the chronic treatment, kidney, liver, and spleen tissues were stained for histopathology studies. In addition, spleen cells were isolated and assessed for activation. In the last experiment, mice were injected with 10 daily doses of 2 mg/kg GRFT in 100 \u00b5L PBS, or vehicle only.

In the case of IL-6, there was no change in cytokine release after treatment with 1 \u03bcM GRFT (Figure 1B). However a slight, but non-significant, increase was observed after treatment with 4 \u03bcM GRFT, and this initial and transient effect was not noticeable by 48 h (Figure 1B). TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were elevated after treatment with ConA but not with GRFT, where most values fell below detection levels, similar to PBS treated cells (Figure 1D).

This resulted in a reduction of typical PBMC number as gated in Figure 2A\u2013E and quantified in Figure 2F. These observations were made even without the use of any fluorophore. Likewise, when the cells were loaded with propidium iodide (PI) which discriminates live from dead cells, flow cytometry histograms of mPBMCs treated with GRFT (1 or 4 \u00b5M) were similar to that obtained for PBS treated cells (Figure S1).

All mice survived this treatment and animal behavior was similar in both GRFT and PBS treatment groups. Throughout the experiment, fitness (as determined by the animal body weight) was unchanged after treatment with GRFT (Figure 4C). In addition, there was no change in lung, kidney, liver, and heart weights after GRFT treatment (data not shown). However, splenomegaly was observed after sacrifice at Day 14: spleen/body weight ratios of 0.64% \u00b1 0.15% and 0.37% \u00b1 0.04% for GRFT and control groups, respectively (Figure 4F). Interestingly, splenomegaly was decreased considerably after two days of recovery, with spleen-to-body weight ratios of 0.52% \u00b1 0.07% for animals treated with GRFT (vs. 0.4% \u00b1 0.04% in the PBS group, p = 0.0546). Seven days post treatment, the difference in spleen/body ratios was not significant (0.41% \u00b1 0.03% and 0.37% \u00b1 0.04% for GRFT and PBS groups, respectively, p = 0.2874) as shown in Figure 4F. Of note, histological studies of kidneys and livers collected at Days 14 and 21 revealed no observable pathology induced by GRFT (data not shown). Despite the splenomegaly, we observed no adverse pathology due to GRFT treatment in spleen tissues after H and E staining. Representative spleens are shown in Figure 5A\u2013C. Interestingly, segmental marginal zone lymphoid depletions were occasionally observed across all groups regardless of treatment. In order to study whether splenomegaly was due to spleen B- and T-lymphocyte activation, mice were treated for 14 days with 10 mg/kg GRFT. Relative to PBS-treated animals, we found that B220-only positive splenocytes were markedly increased in the GRFT group at Day 10 (210.21% \u00b1 73.68% relative to PBS cells, p = 0.0151), a difference that vanished after a week of recovery (Figure 5D). Interestingly, there was no difference between relative amounts of all cells staining positive for B220 (CD19+/B220+ and B220+ only) in splenocytes obtained from PBS or GRFT animals at either time point (Figure 5D). As shown in Figure 5E, cells expressing the T-cell activation marker CD69 were slightly more abundant in animals treated with GRFT (148.10% \u00b1 25.41% relative to the PBS group, p = 0.0221) at Day 10. By Day 17, the difference was markedly reduced with 116.24% \u00b1 3.03% relative to PBS treated mice (p = 0.0295). Likewise, spleen cells expressing both CD4 and CD69 were slightly increased after 14 daily treatments with GRFT (137.28% \u00b1 12.80% relative to PBS, p = 0.0043); this difference was reduced during recovery (121.95% \u00b1 5.58% CD4+/CD69+ relative to PBS, p = 0.0488).",

We were also interested in assessing the toxicity of 2 mg/kg GRFT, administered systemically i.e., subcutaneously or intraperitoneally, to determine the potential adverse effects of GRFT in case of absorption. As shown in Figure 6A, the animals displayed similar body weights throughout the experiment, whether treated with GRFT or PBS, regardless of the administration route. The same observation was made for the relative spleen weights (Figure 6B). In accordance to these results, no activation of spleen B- or T-cells was found after GRFT administration regardless of the route, as evaluated using B220 and CD69 markers, respectively (Figure 6C,D).

In addition, IL-1b, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 amounts in mPBMC culture supernatants were not altered by GRFT at concentrations of up to 4 \u03bcM. IL-6 concentrations were not affected by 1 \u03bcM GRFT, although a transient and moderate increase was observed after treatment with 4 \u03bcM at one day after treatment. These data indicate that GRFT does not boost release of the above four cytokines in mPBMCs, corroborating our previous observations that this lectin induces only minimal changes in the secretion of 27 cytokines and chemokines by human PBMCs, as assessed by multiplexed immunoassays [12].

            "text": "All mice survived single treatments with up to 50 mg/kg, and 14 daily treatments of 10 mg/kg GRFT. In addition, no GRFT treatment related adverse effects in behavior or fitness (body-weight gain or loss) were observed. These findings suggest that GRFT does not cause massive toxicity in mice after parenteral administration. Of note, the amounts of proteins used in these experiments were very high, since we aimed at recording the maximal effects that the lectin could trigger in adult mice. Recently, we demonstrated that GRFT is tolerated with minimal toxicity in juvenile guinea pigs after subcutaneous administration of 10 daily doses of 10 mg/kg [17]. Other lectins have also been studied in mice for their effects after parenteral administration. For instance, in an attempt to determine a well-tolerated dose in mice, Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) was injected beneath the skin of the upper back, and daily doses of 14 mg/kg caused weight loss in mice, while doses of 4.8 mg/kg and lower did not cause any signs of illness [20]. Our data revealed no GRFT treatment-related toxic effects on lungs, livers, kidneys, and hearts, as evaluated by organ weights and/or histology. However reversible splenomegaly was observed in mice treated with a single high dose (50 mg/kg) or chronically with 10 mg/kg GRFT. A study involving Phaseolus vulgaris lectin revealed that parenteral administration of the carbohydrate binding protein affects the extra-intestinal organs in suckling rats [21]. Indeed, it was shown that liver and spleen weights increased in animals treated parenterally with phytohemagglutinin and the authors suggested that the changes in organ weights are the result of an immunological cleansing/response process of these organs in response to the circulating PHA after the s.c. administration [21]. It is plausible that the observed splenomegaly in the case of GRFT reflects a nascent immune reaction from the animals as well. As shown above, B220-only positive splenocytes (CD19-) were elevated after 14 daily treatments with GRFT at 10 mg/kg, a difference that was not obtained after a week of recovery. Recently, a subset of murine splenic cells expressing B220 and lacking CD19 was described by Murakami and collaborators, and proposed to be involved in the formation of a follicular dendritic cell network [22], which plays a critical role in the immune reaction to foreign antigens [23]. It is unclear whether CD19\u2212/B220+ cells increased after GRFT treatment have the same function in our model. In addition, CD69 expressing cells were slightly more abundant after chronic treatment with 10 mg/kg GRFT in this study; this effect was reduced after the recovery period. The effect of CD69 on spleen size remains controversial. While it was demonstrated that induction of the T-cell early activation marker CD69 in mice results in marked splenomegaly [24], CD69 knockout mouse spleens were shown to be enlarged compared with those of WT mice in tumor and collagen-induced arthritis challenge models [25,26].",

            "text": "Subtle toxicity can be indirectly assessed by evaluating the effect of a drug on plasma concentrations of blood chemistry markers. A difference was observed in cholesterol levels, which were increased as a result of single 50 mg/kg or chronic 10 mg/kg doses of GRFT. However, the differences between the vehicle and GRFT groups were sharply reduced after recovery, as shown above. It has been suggested that splenomegaly could result from an increased uptake of unesterified Chol (and other circulating lipids) by splenic macrophages after a case study of a 31 year old man presenting a homogeneously enlarged spleen with an elevated serum total cholesterol [27]. Despite the observed increase in plasma Chol levels after GRFT administration, it is not clear whether high Chol levels are responsible for the described spleen enlargement or vice versa and there are insufficient data to correlate the two anomalies. After chronic treatment with 10 mg/kg GRFT, elevated ALP was observed, but the difference between control and treatment was reduced after recovery. Recently, we reported similar findings in GRFT treated guinea pigs [17]. Normal adult serum mainly contains liver-type ALP with small and variable amounts of intestinal and bone enzyme [28]. At this point, it is unclear whether the increased ALP levels observed reflected liver toxicity. Indeed, no changes were recorded for the other markers of liver toxicity assessed here, including Alb, TBILI, and ALP. Importantly, improvement of spleen enlargement, splenocyte activation, and Chol and ALP levels occurred only a few days post-treatment, indicating that even at high levels, GRFT does not cause irreparable damages to the spleen or the animal as a whole. These findings suggest that in a therapeutic setting, it might be more appropriate to administer the drug at longer time intervals, e.g., every other day, twice weekly, or weekly, rather than daily injections, if the dose of 10 mg/kg is to be maintained.",

            "text": "It has been shown that intravaginal 2 mg/kg GRFT can inhibit HSV-2 [9]; a similar dose would be used for the mucosal prevention of HIV-1. As shown above, GRFT at this dose caused no detectable toxicity in mice after intravaginal treatment. Although it is unlikely for GRFT to be absorbed through mucosal surfaces after intravaginal administration in healthy subjects, it is possible for the drug to get into circulation in individuals suffering from ulcerative STDs. Indeed, it is widely accepted that STDs are an important risk factor for HIV and vice versa [29,30,31]. Therefore, we assessed the effects of 2 mg/kg GRFT delivered by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous administrations, respectively. No adverse effects were found in either case. These results confirm that GRFT has an excellent safety profile as a microbicide candidate, as previously shown using different systems [3,12,16,17]. Interestingly, GRFT was recently shown to significantly protect against genital herpes in a mouse model [9]. Meanwhile, a combination of GRFT and carrageenan displayed potent antiviral effects in mice infected with HSV-2 and human papillomavirus (HPV) [32]. These findings support the development of GRFT as a microbicide for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and other susceptible enveloped viruses.",
