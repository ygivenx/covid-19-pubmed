The only known disease transmitted only through the airborne route is tuberculosis, as reported by Roy and Milton [1]. Aerosol transmission of other diseases could be preferential or opportunistic [1]. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the importance (or not) of the airborne route in disease transmission. The mode of transmission of some diseases is ambiguous. The evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) airborne transmission was first assessed by indirect evidences such as modeling and epidemiological studies [2]. Moreover, the possible airborne transmission of non-respiratory diseases, like Norovirus, is a subject of investigation [3,4,5].",

In fact, only a few studies have looked at the particle size of airborne viruses that can be found in the environment. Anderson 6 stage cascade impactors, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) two-stage bioaerosols cyclone samplers [7,8,9], and Sioutas personal cascade impactors [10,11] have been used in agricultural and hospital settings. In all these studies, viruses were found in all air sample stages, meaning that large particles as well as small particles can carry viruses. More recently, in a laboratory setting, experiments using ferrets and particle impactors of various cut-off sizes demonstrated that influenza virus can be transmitted via droplets (15.3\u20135 \u00b5m) as well as airborne particles (5\u20131.5 \u00b5m) [12].",

By exposing animals to airborne viruses, air sampling can be avoided (preventing virus damage) as well as laboratory virus culture bias in detection. As an example, using animals instead of air samplers can lead to the demonstration that airborne viruses can [14] or cannot [15] infect healthy animals and also that airborne viruses can remain (or not) infectious long enough to travel to a new host. Using a sick animal or human as an aerosol source has also demonstrated that a sick subject can emit aerosols that can potentially infect other susceptible hosts [12].",

The delay between the influenza detection schedule in ferrets in cages two and three can be explained by a lower virus concentration in the air and the infection route. Indeed, the airborne influenza virus genome concentration was lower in cage three compared to cage two in 19 out of 20 sampling days. Large particles eliminated by the separator likely contained high virus concentrations. The airborne influenza virus genome concentration in cage three reached 5 \u00d7 102 genomes/m3 only when influenza virus was detected in the nasal wash of the ferret housed in cage two. Therefore, it is possible that the airborne virus concentration in cage three reached the required concentration to transmit the infection only when the ferret housed in cage two showed flu symptoms.

To further reduce the D50, plates with smaller holes could replace the actual hole plates of the particle separator. This would lead to more accelerated particles and, therefore, more particles being captured by the impaction plates. Ferrets can be used as models for the study of many mammalian viruses, including filovirus [18], respiratory syncytial virus [19] and Morbillivirus [20]. Therefore, the studies that can be conducted in this chamber system are not limited to influenza viruses. Moreover, this cage system can be adapted to accommodate other animals like rats or rabbits.
