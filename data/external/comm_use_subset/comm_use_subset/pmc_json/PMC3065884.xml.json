The protein displays affinity to asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) on hepatocytes and enters the cells through the receptor [7, 8]. Thus, AF has been used as a ligand to deliver drugs to hepatocytes and a competitive inhibitor to ASGP-R [9, 10]. In fact, the widespread use of AF-appended liposomes (AF-liposomes) as a hepatocyte-selective gene transfer carrier has been reported [11, 12]. ",

            "text": "Cyclodextrins (CyDs) have recently been applied to gene transfer and oligonucleotide delivery [13\u201316]. CyDs are cyclic (\u03b1-1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of \u03b1-D-glucopyranose containing a hydrophobic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface, and they are known to be able to act as novel host molecules by chemical modification [17]. Davis and his colleagues reported that the ternary complex of a water-soluble \u03b2-CyD polymer with 6A,6D-dideoxy-6A,- 6D-di-(2-aminoethanethio)-\u03b2-CyD and dimethylsuberimidate (\u03b2CDP6), galactosylated, or transferrin polyethylene glycol conjugates with adamantane, and pDNA possesses higher transfection efficiency in hepatoma or leukemia cells, respectively, through receptor-mediated endocytosis [18, 19]. Recently, we reported the potential use of PAMAM dendrimer functionalized with \u03b1-CyD (\u03b1-CDE) [20] and lactosylated \u03b1-CDE (Lac-\u03b1-CDE) as a hepatocyte specific gene delivery in vitro and in vivo [21]. Meanwhile, Lawrencia et al. reported that lipoplex transfection of pDNA with DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate) in the presence of cholesterol, which is solubilized by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (methyl-\u03b2-CyD), has significantly improved transfection efficiency in urothelial cells due to change in membrane fluidity by methyl-\u03b2-CyD [22]. In addition, we previously demonstrated that intravenous injection of the pegylated liposomes entrapping the doxorubicin (DOX) complex with \u03b3-CyD in BALB/c mice bearing Colon-26 tumor cells showed DOX accumulation in tumor tissues and the potent antitumor effect, compared with those of DOX solution and pegylated liposomes entrapping DOX alone [23]. These lines of evidence suggest that transfection efficiency and pharmacokinetics of pDNA can be altered by the association of CyDs with AF-liposomes. ",

Briefly, lipids mixtures, DLPC/TMAG/DOPE/DPPE (3/2/4/1, molar ratio, the amount of total lipids was 30 \u03bcmol), were dissolved in chloroform, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure by a rotary evaporator. After addition of 5 mL of 0.1 M MES buffer (activation buffer, pH 5.0) containing 0.9% NaCl, the solution was sonicated by a bath type of sonicator (ultrasonic automatic washer US-4, AS ONE, Osaka, Japan) for 5 min under gassing with nitrogen, and then small unilamellar vesicle, large unilamellar vesicle, and/or small oligolamellar liposomes were obtained. Next, 6 mg of AF was dissolved in 1 mL of activation buffer, which contained 3.3 mg of Sulfo-NHS and 1.2 mg of EDC. After mixing for 15 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4.2 \u03bcL of 2-mercaptothanol and obtained Sulfo-NHS-AF. Sulfo-NHS-AF was mixed with LUV and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. After addition of hydroxylamine HCl, AF-liposomes were obtained. To remove the free AF, we performed gel filtration using Sepharose CL-4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) and determined phospholipids and AF by the Bartlett method [24] and the Bradford method [25], respectively. The fractions number 26\u201330, which eluted both phospholipids and AF, were collected as the AF-liposomes fraction (Figure 1(b)). The \u03b6-potential value and particle size of AF-liposomes were 31.2 \u00b1 0.1 mV and 230.7 \u00b1 4.2 nm, respectively. The amount of AF modification in 1 \u03bcmol of AF-liposome lipids was 35.8 \u03bcg/\u03bcmol lipids, indicating that AF modification rate against DPPE in liposomes was 0.75%. Liposomes without AF modification (N-liposomes) was prepared by the solution without Sulfo-NHS-AF, and the other procedure was the same as that of AF-liposomes.",

Briefly, 2 \u03bcL of the solution containing pDNA (1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) and CyDs (1 \u03bcM/\u03bcM lipids) dissolved in TE buffer were added to AF- or N-liposomes suspension. After mixing, the solution was freeze-dried. Then, the sample was rehydrated with THBS (10 mM, pH 7.5) for 30 min. After freezing-thawing for three times, the vesicles were extruded through PVDF membranes (Nucleopore, Plesanton, CA) with pores of diameter 450 and 200 nm. The filtrates were used for further experiments as pDNA/CyDs/AF-liposomes or pDNA/CyDs/N-liposomes. The entrapment ratios of CyDs were evaluated by the anthrone-sulfuric acid method [26]. Briefly, 3 mL of anthrone reagent was added to 0.5 mL of the suspension containing CyDs/liposomes. The tube was covered with a glass ball and was heated for 10 min in boiling water. After quenching with cold water, absorbance of the suspension was measured by a U-2000A spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) at 620 nm. The encapsulation ratios of pDNA were determined by a fluorescent spectrometer F-4500 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, 350 \u03bcL of the suspension containing pDNA/CyD/AF-liposomes in 10 mM THBS (pH 7.5) were mixed with 200 times diluted Picogreen dsDNA reagent (350 \u03bcL). After incubation for 30 min at 25\u00b0C, fluorescent intensity (F\npo) was determined. Next, after addition of 20% of Triton-X (20 \u03bcL) to the sample, fluorescent intensity (F\npt) was determined and the encapsulation ratio of pDNA was calculated as follows: encapsulation ratio (%) = [(F\npt \u00b7 r \u2212 F\npo)/F\npt \u00b7 r] \u00b7 100, where r is compensation coefficient (r = 1.03). Particle size and \u03b6-potential value of liposomes in 10 mM THBS (pH 7.5) were measured by a submicron particle analyzer N4 Plus (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and ELS-8000 (Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan), respectively.",

In addition, CyDs are well known to disrupt liposomal membranes, depending on CyD cavity sizes and membrane components [31, 32]. Then, we evaluated the interaction of CyDs with AF-liposomes by measuring the leakage of calcein, a fluorescent marker, from calcein-encapsulated AF-liposomes in isotonic Tris-HCl-buffered saline (pH 7.5) (Figure 2). \u03b1-CyD and DM-\u03b2-CyD significantly increased calcein leakage from calcein-encapsulated AF-liposomes after incubation for 30 min in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, calcein leakage in the presence of \u03b3-CyD and three types of HP-CyDs was low even at the concentration of 20 mM CyDs. These results suggest that the interaction of \u03b3-CyD and HP-CyDs with AF-liposomes was weaker than that of \u03b1-CyD and DM-\u03b2-CyD.",

The extent of EGFP-expressing cells in the pDNA/AF-liposomes system without CyDs was found to be 8%, while that with \u03b3-CyD and HP-\u03b3-CyD were 19% and 10%, respectively (Figure 5(a)). Additionally, the enhancing effect of \u03b3-CyD was observed in the pGL3-control vector encoding firefly luciferase and having a SV40 promoter (Figure 5(b)). These results suggest that the enhancing effect of \u03b3-CyD on gene transfer activity of AF-liposomes is a gene- and promoter-independent manner. To confirm whether pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes have ASGP-R-mediated gene transfer activity, we performed transfection experiments in HepG2 cells in the presence and absence of AF, as an ASGP-R competitive inhibitor. Here, we confirmed that ASGP-R are expressed in HepG2 cells by the RT-PCR method (data not shown), which is consistent with previous findings [33\u201335]. As shown in Figure 6, gene transfer activity of AF-liposomes was markedly inhibited by the addition of AF, but not BSA, a control protein. These results suggest that AF-liposomes had the ASGP-R-mediated gene transfer activity. Interestingly, the similar enhancing effects of \u03b3-CyD on Renilla luciferase protein expression after transfection of pDNA/AF-liposomes were, however, observed in A549 cells and NIH3T3 cells, ASGP-R negative cells (Figure 7).

Therefore, to evaluate the effects of \u03b3-CyD on lipid-lipid interactions in AF-liposomes, we performed DSC analysis of DLPC-liposomes in the presence and absence of \u03b3-CyD. The reason why we used DLPC-liposomes is due to clear observation of lipid-lipid interaction using DLPC composed of AF-liposomes. Figure 10 shows the effects of \u03b3-CyD and HP-\u03b3-CyD on DSC thermograms, phase transition temperature, and enthalpy (\u0394Hcal) of DLPC-liposomes (5 mM of total lipids). The phase transition temperature (Tc) of DLPC-liposomes in the presence of \u03b3-CyD was shifted to high temperature as the concentration of \u03b3-CyD was increased (Figures 10(a) and 10(c)). The \u0394Hcal value of DLPC-liposomes in the \u03b3-CyD system was drastically elevated at 20 mM of \u03b3-CyD (Figure 10(d)). Meanwhile, in the case of HP-\u03b3-CyD, there was no significant change in DSC thermograms, phase transition temperature, and the \u0394Hcal values (Figures 10(b), 10(c) and 10(d)).

In the present study, we prepared AF-liposomes with a lipid composition of TMAG/DOPE/DLPC/DPPE (2/4/3/1, molar ratio). DOPE is known to enhance the endosomal escape of pDNA due to its structural change into hexagonal II form at pH 5-6, an endosomal pH range, resulting in destabilizing endosomal membranes [38, 39]. TMAG, a cationic lipid, makes it possible to interact with pDNA in AF-liposomes. Additionally, DPPE was used as a binding lipid with AF. Actually, cationic liposomes composed of TMAG/DOPE/DLPC (1/2/2, molar ratio) are commercially available transfection reagents as GeneTransfer, which have already been utilized in a clinical trial for a nonviral vector to deliver the interferon-\u03b2 gene for the treatment of brain tumor in Japan [40].

In fact, the CLSM study demonstrated that cellular uptake of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes was higher than that of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes (Figure 11). Furthermore, we confirmed that transfection efficiency of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes was increased, as the encapsulation ratio of pDNA into pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes was augmented (Table 4). In view of the findings, the particle size of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes and encapsulation ratio of pDNA into pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes are crucial role for enhancing transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes.

            "text": " The important question regarding the enhancing effect of \u03b3-CyD on transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes still remains, because three types of HP-CyDs did not have the enhancing effect. To address this question, the DSC analysis was performed. This study indicated that \u03b3-CyD, but not HP-\u03b3-CyD, changed membrane fluidity and stabilized the N-liposomal membranes (Figure 9). In fact, \u03b3-CyD increased the Tc value of DLPC-liposomes, although HP-\u03b3-CyD did not increase anymore (Figure 10). This increase in the Tc value induced by \u03b3-CyD could be attributed to a compactness of lipid bilayer of DLPC liposomes. It is thereby possible that \u03b3-CyD may increase Tc values of the other liposomes such as DMPC, DPPC, and DSPC. Here, it is well known that \u03b3-CyD is highly hydrophilic and surface inactive [17]. Therefore, we presumed that \u03b3-CyD encapsulates the aqueous compartment of liposomes rather than in the bilayer of liposomes. Anyhow, it is clear that the magnification of the interaction of liposomal membranes containing DLPC with HP-\u03b3-CyD is weaker than that with \u03b3-CyD, possibly due to the steric hindrance of the HP group in a HP-\u03b3-CyD molecule. Taken together, it is likely that the stabilizing effects of \u03b3-CyD on AF-liposomal membrane may lead to inhibition of pDNA leakage from AF-liposomes and increase in cellular uptake of pDNA, eventually leading to the enhancement of in vitro transfection efficiency of pDNA/\u03b3-CyD/AF-liposomes in cells.

Consequently, the potential use of \u03b3-CyD could be expected as an enhancer of gene transfer activity of AF-liposomes.
