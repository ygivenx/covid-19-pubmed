            "text": "Viruses of the Circoviridae family are known to infect a wide range of vertebrates. The virions consist of naked nucleocapsids of about 20 nm in diameter, with a circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome of approximately 2.0 kb [1]. They have an ambisense genome organization containing two major open reading frames (ORFs) inversely arranged, responsible for encoding the replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, and are separated by a 3\u2019 intergenic region (IGR) between the stop codons and a 5\u2019 IGR between the start codons [2]. Some circoviruses are major pathogens of pigs [3\u20135], e.g. porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) which causes either asymptomatic infections or clearly apparent disease which may be responsible for significant economic losses [6\u201310]. In birds, avian circoviruses, within the genus Gyrovirus, have been identified in a broad range of avian species; one of them, chicken anemia virus (CAV), is a major cause of disease, associated to lymphoid depletion, immunosuppression and developmental abnormalities [11\u201315]. According to the document 2014.006a-gV from ICTV, there is a proposal of the Gyrovirus genus removal from Circoviridae to Anelloviridae family due to recent metagenomic studies on gyroviruses showing a very high sequence divergence when compared to other circoviruses members.",

Some of the newly described circular genomes are similar to those of circoviruses, but phylogenetically different from the previously known avian and porcine circoviruses [18]. Their distinct nucleotide/amino acid composition and genome organization allowed authors to propose the creation of a new genus within the Circoviridae, which was named Cyclovirus. In comparison to members of the genus Circovirus, both rep and cap cycloviruses genes are smaller, with shorter or no 3\u2019 IGR between the stop codons of the two major ORFs and a longer 5\u2019 IGR between the start codons of the two major ORFs [2].",

For the second (nested) reaction, the 25 \u03bcL mix components were: 1 \u03bcL of the 1st reaction product, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 \u03bcM of each primer (CV-F2 and CV-R2), 1.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 10% PCR buffer and 0.6 mM dNTPs. The cycling conditions were: 5 min at 95\u00b0C; 40 cycles of 1 min at 95\u00b0C, 1 min at 56\u00b0C, 1 min at 72\u00b0C, and a final incubation at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Products with a size of approximately 400 bp were purified and directly sequenced using primer CV-R2. To confirm the sequences, each product was sequenced three times. Samples were sequenced with the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (Applied Biosystems, UK) in an ABI-PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (ABI, Foster City, CA), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Sequences similar to the rep gene sequences of circovirus-like-genomes were aligned for designing of new sets of primers to perform the inverse PCR (iPCR). The iPCR were carried out in a 25 \u03bcL reaction mixture optimized with Platinum Taq Hi-Fi (Invitrogen\u2122) (cycling conditions can be informed upon request) and the primer sequences as follows: Circo1_F (5\u2019-CTTTCTCCCAGTTAATTCTCC-3\u2019), Circo1_R (5\u2019-GAGCAAGTGGAACAGGTAAAT-3\u2019), Circo2_F (5\u2019-TCAAAGCGTGCACTTGA-3\u00b4), Circo2_R (5\u2019-ACAGGATTGTAGATCAGTACGT-3\u2019), Circo5_F (5\u2019-GAGATGCAAGAATGGATTGC-3\u2019), Circo5_R (5\u2019-GCAATATTTGCTTGCCGC-3\u2019), Circo6_F (5\u2019-GAGAGTATCAACGCAGAAAG-3\u2019), Circo6_R (5\u2019-CTTTGATAAATTAGCGAACC-3\u2019), Circo7_F (5\u2019-AGAGGCTCAACAAATAGACGC-3\u2019), Circo7_R (5\u2019-TGCTTTTTGATGGTACTGAA-3\u2019). Standard precautions were taken to avoid contamination and negative controls were added to each batch of reactions. Five microliters of the PCR products were electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gels and the products visualized on UV light after staining with ethidium bromide. The amplicons corresponding to the sizes ranging from 1\u20132 kb were purified and cloned into pCR 2.1-TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen\u2122). Three insert-containing plasmids of each clone were sequenced with M13 forward and reverse primers as described above. The full-length sequence of genomes was constructed by \u201cgenome walking\u201d using the Geneious software (version 7.1.3).",

BLASTX analysis showed that these partial rep sequences have an amino acid identity of 10\u201376% with those of known circoviruses and 87\u2013100% among themselves. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences herein detected with those of the representative Circovirus and Cyclovirus sequences (Fig. 1). As shown in the tree, it was observed the arrangement of five main groups with clusters II (4 sequences), VI (3 sequences) and VII (2 sequences) falling into the clade of cycloviruses, in contrast to clusters I (13 sequences) and V (2 sequences) that formed distinct and distant groups from those formed by circoviruses and cycloviruses. The arbitrary division of these sequences in clusters was carried out to analyze their genomic features, assuming that according to the criteria used for Circovirus diversity analysis, distinct species comprising more than >20% sequence divergence are considered to be classified as an individual viral [32]. According to this, we could infer the detection of five potential new species from bat samples (3 cycloviruses and 2 circoviruses).",

As shown in the trees, BatCV POA/2012/II and VI fell into the cyclovirus clade already identified in chickens, chimps, bats, goats, humans and dragonflies [2,17,18,20,22]. When analyzing the cap-encoding region (Fig. 3A), BatCV POA/2012/II was related to a Cyclovirus detected in muscle tissues of a goat from Pakistan through degenerate/consensus PCR [20], and BatCV POA/2012/VI was more related to dragonfly Cyclovirus detected through viral metagenomics [22]. However, when analyzing both genomes according to the conserved rep-encoding region, it was observed that they formed a monophyletic clade (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, BatCV POA/2012/I and V fell outside the Circovirus and Cyclovirus clades, not yet related to any genus of Circoviridae family along with Bat circovirus-like virus TM6 and batCV-SC703 [17,18]. This situation was confirmed based on the alignments of the whole genomes, producing a similar tree topology (see Fig. 3C). These sequences are closer to sequences detected in guano and fecal samples collected from bats in the United States and China through metagenomic approaches, suggesting that these viruses have the same host origin, likely from bats [17,18]. However, currently, no classification has been fully considered to these sequences.",

In the recent years, many genomes of circoviruses, cycloviruses and rep-containing circular DNA viruses have been characterized in mammals, birds, insects and environmental samples [19] bringing to light a high level of genetic diversity among these viruses [19,35]. According to our results, two genomes belong to genus Cyclovirus (BatCV POA II and VI). These genomes are organized and contain two major ORFs in opposite directions, presenting in their 5\u2019 IGR of the rep ORF the cyclovirus-conserved nonanucleotide motif (5\u2019-TAATACTAT-3\u2019) in their loop region (Table 3). BatCV POA I and V present their cap located in the positive strand and the larger rep located on the minus strand, as expected for circoviruses, but this pattern was not present in BatCV POA II and VI, as shown in Table 1. The phylogenetic analysis constructed based on the alignments of the complete REP and CAP protein confirms that BatCV POA/II and VI cluster into the genus Cyclovirus along with the Chinese cycloviruses sequences clade detected in bat feces [18] and sharing less than 65% of identity at the CAP/REP amino acid level. BatCV POA I and V had a low amino acid identity with CAP (<20%) and REP (<10%) sequences of two other sequences detected in bat feces in this study with known circoviruses/cycloviruses (Table 2). Consequently, they formed a distinct clade along with other bat-sourced sequences, expanding the view of diversity in these new ssDNA viruses that are divergent enough at the sequence level that they could very likely be part of a different genus.",

These new genomes have in common the presence in the Rep N-terminus of the same motifs associated with rolling circle replication (FTLNN, TPHLQGY) and dNTP-binding (GXGKS), as well as the conserved identified in the carboxy half of Rep amino acid motifs associated with 2C helicase function (WWDGY and DRYP) [19]. The N-terminal regions related to Cap proteins of BatCV POA I and V are highly basic and arginine-rich, as is typical for circoviruses capsid proteins with arginine residues ranging from 36%-42% (Genome I and V, respectively) along the first 50 aa, in contrast to TM6 (28%) and SC703 (26%). They are also distinguishable based on their CAP and REP sizes (data not shown), as well as on the low amino acid level for both proteins, as the percentage of amino acid identity of BatCV POA I and V shows a REP identity <45% and <35% for CAP identity in relation to TM6 and SC703. Based on these genomes characteristics, even though they are clustered in a separate clade, not yet characterized, they are new viral species. Upon the discovery of other sequences grouping along with these genomes, it will be of interest to propose the creation of a new genus within Circoviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).",
