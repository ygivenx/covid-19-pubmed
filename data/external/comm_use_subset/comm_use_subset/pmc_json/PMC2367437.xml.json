Much progress has been made in understanding the SARS coronavirus, but its pathogenesis in infected individuals remains unclear [2]. The early reports showed that old age, diabetes mellitus and heart disease were risk factors for adverse prognosis of SARS [3], [4]. Genetic host factors are as well supposed to play an important role, and polymorphisms in several genes have been tested for their association with the infection [5]\u2013[13]. Three studies have investigated role of angiotensin converting enzyme gene in disease pathogenesis or disease outcome with conflicting results [5]\u2013[7]. Two independent studies displayed the significant role of the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) genetic polymorphisms in SARS infection [8], [9]. Other candidate genes, such as OAS1 and MxA gene [10], interferon gamma gene [11] and RANTES gene [12], ICAM3 gene [13] were also identified in recent studies. A better understanding of these genes will provide new insights into the disease pathogenesis. This knowledge will also aid in identifying the biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of vaccination and other interventions.",

            "text": "Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine secreted by activated phagocytes and dendritic cells [14]. It plays a pivotal role in promoting Th1-type immune responses and cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 triggers many biological functions: it stimulates the proliferation of activated T- and NK-cells, enhances T- and NK-cell-mediated cytolytic activity, and induces the production of IFN-\u03b3 by both T-and NK-cells (Trinchieri 1998). The interferon-\u03b3 production induced by IL-12 forms a major link between innate and adaptive immunity [15]. A recent study revealed that interferon-mediated immunopathological events are associated with atypical innate and adaptive immune responses in SARS patients [16]. We thus reasoned that IL-12 might also play a role in resistance to SARS, which is signaled through the direct binding of the IL-12 molecule to its receptor (IL- 12R). IL-12R has been shown to consist of at least two distinct subunits, B1 and B2, that associate to form a high-affinity IL-12R complex expressed on activated T- and NK-cells (17,18). In the current study, we hypothesized that polymorphisms of the IL-12R B1 gene might be associated with SARS susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a case control study to investigate the association between IL-12R B1 genetic polymorphisms and SARS in Chinese individuals.",

During the 2003 SARS epidemic, a total of 132 confirmed SARS patients were reported from these two hospitals, which derived from two completely unrelated super spread events (SSE). All of the patients had been hospitalized for treatment, from which we selected 115 confirmed SARS cases for the study. Three of the remaining patients died and the other 14 patients were unavailable for study, because of the inconvenience of revisiting. The diagnosis was made according to the criteria published by the Chinese Ministry of Public Health, and subsequently confirmed by antibody seroconversion and/or detectable SARS-CoV RNA in respiratory secretions. Two control groups were used, individuals with close contacts with SARS patients (control A) and healthy controls (control B). Control A group consists of 141 subjects who had close contacts with confirmed SARS patients but were not infected, according to criteria that was defined by the World Health Organization [19]. Among these individuals were 110 high-risk health care workers who had been treating SARS patients for a prolonged duration, and 31 individuals who had shared a meal, utensil, residence, ward, vehicle, etc., with SARS patients. Control B group included 155 healthy, unrelated Chinese blood donors, who had blood drawn during July 2001\u2013October 2002. All controls were tested negative for IgG antibody against SARS-CoV prior to being included into the study. All subjects contributed 3ml anti-coagulated blood after written informed consent was obtained. We also used a standard questionnaire to collect demographic information (including age, ethnicity, region of origin, marital status, living environment, education level et al). All subjects were confirmed as genetically unrelated through interviewing. The comorbidity conditions that might have effect on disease susceptibility, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, asthma, tuberculosis, and malignancy, were traced by reviewing medical records and self reporting. The study protocol was approved by the ethical committee at the National Center for AIDS Prevention and Control.",

The OR and P values were calculated by multivariate logistic regression analysis with age, sex , comorbidity presence and infection source entered as covariates in the model, given the relevance of these potential confounding variables in interpreting the study results. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 10.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). To correct for multiple testing, we used spectral decomposition (SpD) of matrices of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs, which adjusts for multiple testing while taking into account LD among the tested SNPs [21]. This method showed that P-values of 0.0227 and below can be considered as statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. The software HAPLOVIEW (version 2.05) was used to construct haplotypes from the genotype data. This program calculates association statistics for multilocus haplotypes in case-control data using the expectation- maximisation algorithm to estimate haplotype odds ratios across multiple categories, giving a likelihood ratio test of homogeneity.",

We genotyped 4 SNPs (+705A/G, +1158T/C , +1196G/C and +1664 C/T) that have been alleged to cause missense mutations of the IL-12 RB1 gene in SARS patients , close contacts and healthy controls. These four SNPs (one novel) have been confirmed to cause missense variants in the extracellular coding sequence of the IL12R\u03921gene. These four SNPs lie within 6.2-kb span of genomic DNA on chromosome 19p13.1. It is suggested that one or more of the four missense variants could affect the quality (or quantity) of the gene products and cause mild functional impairment in the receptor's responsiveness to IL-12 [25]. The results show that individuals with 1664 C/T (CT) and (TT) genotype were at increased risk of susceptibility to SARS infection. When only severe patients were considered, the significance disappeared, in comparison with the mild patients. We also estimated the frequencies of IL-12 RB1 haplotypes, which composed of 4 polymorphic alleles, and identified risk haplotype (GCCT) that might confer genetic susceptibility to SARS infection. In agreement with this finding, the +1664 C/T (T) allele was among the risk haplotypes GCCT, whereas the alternative C allele was among the protective haplotype (GCCC). These findings support the association between IL12B1 polymorphism and SARS infection, but not necessary the disease outcome in Chinese population.",

When healthy blood donors were used as controls, no association could be detected. We reasoned that genetic difference between the two control groups might partly account for the distinct observations with regard to SARS susceptibility, i.e. close contacts might be more immunogenetically resistant to SARS infection than healthy controls. In this case, close contacts might serve as more suitable controls healthy individuals, who had never been exposed to SARS-CoV. It's as well intriguing that the pattern of polymorphism in +1664 C/T in SARS patients deviated slightly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. As noted in the previous study[26], detection of HW disequilibrium at SNP loci in the case sample could be an indicator that a disease/susceptibility gene is within the region. There are also other possibilities indicated, like that a pseudo-SNP is present, DNA contamination, or a genotyping error, however, these latter possibilities are unlikely since we have duplicated the genotyping assay for all the samples with ambiguous results through sequencing. This also can be argued from the observed perfect adherence to Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium from control group. The chance of subgroup is minor, since all the subjects were Chinese Han population without consanguineous relationship. Taken together, we suggested this deviation was from the correlation between genetic variant and disease, instead of false association.",

These studies thus cannot exclude the possible false association caused by the differentiated viral adaption in humans. The SARS patients in the current study were mostly health care workers in two SARS-designated hospitals. Epidemiological investigations have clearly defined detailed transmission among those patients, showing each of the group came from one super spread chain arising from one infection source. In the multiple logistic analysis, we used the infection source as one of the covariants, and by doing so, we could technically exclude the potential confounding effect that might be caused by viral factor(s). Advanced age and presence of comorbidity are other two factors that might influence the disease susceptibility[3], [4], which were excluded from potential confounding by multiple variants analysis.",

Especially for the +C1664T SNP, different percentages of genotypes were missing from SARS, Control A, and Control B groups (18.2%, 6.4% and 3.2% respectively). One can reasonably argue there was another SNP that accounted for the increased fraction of subjects without the defined genotypes in the SARS patient group. It can also be argued that the significant SNPs actually are not functional variants of the IL-12RB1 protein, but instead it is presumably in linkage disequilibrium with a potential functional variant(s) in other loci of the gene. Presently 15 coding, nonsynonymous SNPS are listed in the Entrez database dbSNP, out of a total of 274 known human SNPs for IL12RB1, however, the genotyping for other SNPs in small group of the current population showed MAF (minor allele frequency) of less than 5% (unpublished data). We thus propose the lack of a complete analysis of the SNPS in this gene can pose no severe damage to the study. Still we could not formally exclude possible additional causal variation(s) elsewhere in the gene. The sequencing of the exon and the promoter regions of the IL12RB1 gene from the SARS patient cohort could be helpful in identifying other SNPs which could alter the gene expression level. It would also be warranted to examine whether the same association is observed in other ethnic groups. On the other hand, a relatively small sample size inevitably resulted in limitations of the power to detect significant association in disease outcome. As such, the negative results on SNPs for disease outcome revealed in this study do not necessarily exclude their association with SARS.",

One could then hypothesize that decreased IL-12R activity might predispose to infection but protect from severe disease manifestations. However, the data presented here appear to suggest that IL-12R activity is required for protection from severe disease, although the association between genetic polymorphisms and severe disease was no longer significant after multiple test correction was applied to the analysis. Therefore the actual role of IL12 in the protection from or susceptibility to severe disease still need more evidence from animal experiments.",
