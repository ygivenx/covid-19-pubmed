            "text": "Technology for detecting biothreat agents requires accurate identification of a broad array of bacterial and viral organisms that can cause severe disease and/or death, whether they occur as a result of a biological attack or from a natural source in the environment. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has compiled a list of priority pathogens for biodefense (http://www.niaid.nih.gov) and several of these are also defined as select agents (http://www.selectagents.gov/) by various agencies such as Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (some of the vaccine and live attenuated strains are, however, excluded from the select agents list: http://www.selectagents.gov/Select%20Agents%20and%20Toxins%20Exclusions.html). These bioagents are often virtually indistinguishable from a group of phylogenetically related species or subspecies often referred to as \u201cnear neighbors\u201d [1]. Near neighbors to biothreat agents may be human pathogens or harmless environmental organisms. The biothreat agent along with its near neighbors can be thought of as a biothreat cluster or biocluster for short. When monitoring for biothreat agents, it is important to determine whether any organisms from the biothreat clusters are present and to precisely identify the organism as a biothreat agent or a near neighbor. In some cases, the near neighbors are commonly found in the environment, and it is possible that a pathogenic near neighbor of a biothreat agent might deliberately be chosen for use in a biological attack. Thus, effective biosensor technology must be capable of identifying a broad array of biothreat agents and distinguishing these threats from their near neighbors unambiguously.",

            "text": "This requirement presents a problem for conventional molecular methods where specific PCR is used in conjunction with probes to detect specific bioagents. Not only are potentially pathogenic near neighbors present in a specimen often not distinguished, but the near neighbors sometimes react to produce false positives for the biothreat agent. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a new strategy for biothreat identification that couples biothreat cluster-specific PCR amplification to electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) [2]\u2013[4]. The biothreat assay is performed on a hardware platform with prototypes known as TIGER [4] and as the Ibis T5000 [2], [5] that is now marketed commercially as the Abbott PLEX-ID [6]. In the PCR/ESI-MS approach, PCR primers are designed to amplify regions of the genomes of all species from the entire biothreat cluster, encompassing groups of organisms that include the biothreat and the associated near-neighbor organisms. The primers are designed to target genomic regions sufficiently conserved such that amplification occurs comprehensively within a biothreat cluster, but not outside of the cluster. The amplification products are then analyzed by mass spectrometry, which weighs the amplicons with sufficient mass accuracy that the base composition of A, G, C, and T nucleotides that make up the amplicon can be accurately counted. The base composition serves as a signature of each organism and enables identification and discrimination of the biothreat agents and their near neighbors with equal facility. In addition, previously undiscovered or newly emerging organisms from within these biothreat clusters are also detected. The database of signatures against which multiple additional pathogens could be identified increases over time as newer strain variants are archived and tested. An example of this was the discovery of the 2009 H1N1 virus by the Naval Health Research Center [7], [8]; this offered the first characterization of a previously unrecognized influenza strain, demonstrating the capability of the PLEX-ID in identification of a real-world case of novel pathogen emergence. Because the mass spectrometer weighs all amplicons presented to it, the amplicons from unexpected or new organisms are detected and identified [2], [5], [9], [10].",

Classical microbiological methods can only differentiate B. anthracis from other near-neighbor species when the unknown isolate is shown to cause anthrax in laboratory animal models.

Full virulence of B. anthracis requires the presence of two plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, containing three toxin components (protective antigen, lethal factor, and edema factor) and an anti-phagocytic capsule. The primers used for the detection of these two plasmids (BCT2379 and BCT2381) were chosen to capture a previously described single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [17]. This region in each of the plasmids provides two different alleles that can be used to distinguish B. anthracis Ames and other Ames-like strains from non-Ames strains. Thus, the positive identification of the B. anthracis chromosome using the infB and sspE targets, combined with detection of the virulence plasmid signatures, can be used to differentiate non-pathogenic, vaccine, fully virulent, and genetically modified strains of B. anthracis.",

Each isolate was correctly identified by comparison of base composition signatures obtained in the biothreat assay with genomic sequence data obtained from GenBank (Table 2). The infB locus provided identical signatures across all B. anthracis strains tested, whereas the sspE locus provided two different allelic signatures. The majority of the B. anthracis strains tested had a base composition signature of \u201cA42G23C23T21,\u201d whereas the B. anthracis strains from the western North American region showed a SNP at this locus and had the signature of \u201cA41G24C23T21.\u201d As predicted, the Ames-like strains were different from the rest of the B. anthracis strains in the pXO1 and pXO2 loci. An additional 89 strains of B. anthracis were obtained from the Keim Genetics Lab; these strains have various phylogenetic variations (Table S2). The diverse strains in this collection were correctly identified in our assay. The A1.a clade showed the SNP pattern at the sspE locus previously associated with the western North American lineage (Table S3).

Some of the B. thuringiensis species have individual clusters but most are related to B. cereus species. Several studies over the past two decades have looked at the fine structure of the B. cereus clade and have reported similar findings [18]. Nucleic acids from species outside the B. cereus clade, such as B. subtilis and B. megaterium, were not amplified with the sspE primer pair.

Y. pestis is classified as a biothreat agent. It is a nonmotile, capsulated, Gram-negative bacterium transmitted to humans and susceptible animals through flea bites or aerosols. Other species in this biocluster include Y. enterocolitica (a diarrheagenic pathogen), Y. frederiksenii, Y. ruckeri, and Y. pseudotuberculosis (an enteric pathogen). Y. pseudotuberculosis exhibits more than 90% genomic homology with Y. pestis, making much of the Y. pestis genome unsuitable for amplification as base composition signatures do not resolve Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis\n[20], [21]. Two specific markers within the Y. pestis genome were identified that provide differentiation from Y. pseudotuberculosis. One of these is located in the valyl-tRNA synthetase gene (valS). This region (Table 1) has a SNP that is retained in all the Y. pestis genomes studied to date and that is distinct from the Y. pseudotuberculosis signature for this region (Table S4). A second primer pair was designed to target the invasin gene invA, a surface-expressed protein that is reponsible for cellular penetration and invasion. Although both Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica contain intact invasin genes, the central region of the Y. pestis inv gene is disrupted by a 708-bp IS200-like element [22]. Primers targeting this region allow for the unambiguous detection of Y. pestis (Table S4). In addition, Y. pestis harbors plasmids that are required for the expression of virulence [23]\u2013[26]. Primer pairs targeted against the pla gene from the pPCP1 plasmid of Y. pestis and the caf1 gene from the pMT1 plasmid of Y. pestis were included in the assay to provide specific detection of virulence plasmid-carrying Y. pestis.",

The near-neighbor species F. novicida (considered by some investigators to be another subspecies of F. tularensis) and F. philomiragia are reportedly of of low pathogenicity and cause disease only in immunocompromised humans [30].

Use of galE for identification of Francisella genus has been previously described [31]. Based on inspection of the sequence alignments for these genes of all available Francisella sequences, both of these primer pairs are expected to generate amplicons from all known members of the Francisella genus. Base composition analysis of the expected amplicons shows that Francisella species and subspecies are distinguishable from each other (Table S7). F. tularensis base counts are characterized by a homogenous signature for all type A.I strains. Schu S4 is the type strain, and the rest of the Francisella signatures are defined here as variations compared to this reference strain. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis str.

This is in agreement with genome-wide SNP analysis, which indicates that differentiation of these particular strains likely predated the acquisition of the asd or galE mutations that characterize the subspecies. Further, the subspecies mediaasiatica is reported to be closer to the Type A.II lineage, even though its pathogenicity is characteristic of the Type B strains [29].

Included were members of all phylogenetic lineages within the Francisella biocluster. Francisella species were correctly identified and grouped into phylogenetic clades. All 34 Type A.I subspecies yielded identical base compositions for both primer pairs consistent with the predicted amplicons from the Schu S4 genome. Twelve of the type B, subspecies holarctica strains had signatures that differed from the Type A.I subspecies in both the primer pairs, clearly differentiating the two major groups of the Francisella genus. Type A.II strain signatures were different from the Type A.I signatures by a single T to C SNP in the galE primer amplicon, consistent with the genome sequence of Francisella subsp. tularensis strain WY96-3128. However, two of the Type B strains tested, FRAN041 (Strain JAP-Cincinnati) and FRAN011 (Strain LR) could not be distinguished from the Type A.II subspecies using these two primer pairs. As described above, this signature appears to be consistent with subsp. mediaasiatica strains as well. Sequence similarities between the Type B Japanese strains, F. tularensis mediaasiatica and Type A.II lineages were previously noted ([29], Duncan, manuscript in preparation). The F. novicida strain (FRAN003) differed from Type A.I by a single SNP in the galE region, whereas the species outlier, F. philomiragia, was clearly different from the rest of the F. tularensis biocluster in both primer regions. The asd primer pair produced the expected amplicon for all strains of F. philomiragia. In contrast, the galE locus primer pair did not yield an amplicon for all strains. This region in a recently sequenced F. philomiragia strain (ATCC 25017) has mismatches to the primer regions (Genbank Accession Number NC_010336). Even without data from the asd primer pair, the differentiation of this species from other F. tularensis was unambiguous. Based on the two primer analysis done here, Francisella strains could be categorized into five groups: Types \u201cA.I,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cnovicida,\u201d \u201cphilomiragia,\u201d and a fifth group that contains strains within the Type A.II/mediaasiatica/holarctica/Japanese lineages that might have diverged before the acquisition of the asd and galE mutations.",

Base compositions from these regions were able to distinguish the various species tested and provided sub-species differentiation within the V. cholerae isolates. For the biothreat assay, three of the primer pairs from the pan-Vibrio assay were used (Table 1). One of these primer pairs was exclusive to V. cholerae species detection (ompU). One amplifies the toxin gene ctxA. The third primer pair, targeted to gapA gene, was designed to amplify most of the known species in this family and the resulting base compositions provide species-level resolution (Table S8). Genomic data analysis and experimental analysis of 42 well-characterized strains representing the phylogeny of this biocluster was used to demonstrate assay specificity.",

We have previously described a pan-Orthopoxvirus assay for identification of all members of the genus based on four PCR reactions targeting Orthopoxvirus DNA and RNA helicase and polymerase genes. The assay can detect and identify diverse orthopoxviruses, provide sub-species information, and characterize viruses from the blood of rabbitpox virus-infected rabbits [11]. In the biothreat assay, we used two of these four primer pairs (VIR979 and VIR985). The two provide species-level resolution of the genus Orthopoxvirus and, in particular, differentiate the Variola and monkeypox viruses from each other and from vaccinia, rabbitpox, and ectromelia viruses (Table S17).",

Influenza viruses cause serious global economic and public health burdens. Emergence of new influenza A virus strains can be caused by \u201cantigenic shift,\u201d resulting from reassortment of gene segments (including H and/or N types), by \u201cantigenic drift\u201d resulting from the continuing accumulation of mutations in the H and N genes, or by species jump by a virus that acquires the ability to infect and be transmitted among humans as has happened in the influenza pandemics over the last century [42], [43]. In April 2009, a previously unseen virus emerged and rapidly spread globally leading to the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. The continuous evolution of influenza genomes together with reassortment events pose challenges to the effective monitoring of influenza viruses. We previously described an RT-PCR/ESI-MS assay for the detection and characterization of influenza viruses [8], [10], [15], [16], [44], [45]. Identification of each influenza A virus is based on the summation of base composition signatures obtained from the six to eight primer pairs.",

The majority of these could be grouped into the six base composition clusters as shown in Table S18.

In parallel, samples were also tested in DNA elution buffer (TE buffer) alone. Fivefold serial dilutions of nucleic acid samples (with a high concentration of 1000 GE/well for all targets except VEEV which was 5000 GE/well) of the nucleic acid extracts from all the target organisms were prepared and 10 replicates of each dilution of each agent were analyzed. The presumptive LOD was ascribed to be the lowest concentration resulting in 10 correct identifications and detections in all primer pairs targeting each biothreat cluster (Figure S4). Additional replicates were analyzed (as many as 105) to allow for sufficient data to determine the LOD with a 95% confidence interval. These measured LODs were used for subsequent analysis. Nucleic acids from test organisms were paired to reduce overall sample numbers (for example, B. anthracis and vaccinia virus nucleic acids were spiked together and analyzed in the same sample). These LOD studies were preceded by analysis of synthetic constructs, plasmids containing DNA sequences similar to those of the biothreat agents. These constructs were carefully measured using real-time PCR assays targeting the plasmid backbone (data not shown). Using this synthetic approach, the LOD for the various target primer pairs in the biothreat assay were determined to be between 7 and 250 genome equivalents (GE) per well, with most organisms detected at between 15 and 62.5 GE/well (Figure S4). The outliers were the three RNA virus groups, which showed either 125 or 250 GE/well LOD.",

Because those samples did not contain any of the other 14 threat agents, the data from the analysis of those samples could be used to calculate the false positive rate. The false positive rates for each of the threat agents tested was 0%, except for Rickettsia prowazekii, which was 14% (Table 4). The matrix that was used as background had high loads of environmental bacterial signatures (data not shown), including alphaproteobacteria such as Rickettsia and Mesorhizobium species. These might account for the observed higher false positive rates for rickettsial species compared to other organisms. Higher background prevalence of some of the potential biothreat agents or their near neighbors in certain regions of the world might similarly affect other detections.

The assay also identifies a broad range of near-neighbor organisms that may cause severe disease in humans or animals or that may be harmless environmental organisms. The biothreat cluster analysis strategy using PCR/ESI-MS addresses several fundamental design requirements for biothreat protection. First, biothreat agents and near-neighbor organisms are identified unambiguously and equally. Closely related organisms often cause false alarms in conventional PCR approaches to detect biothreat agents. Perhaps more importantly, it enables identification of unexpected pathogens within the biothreat clusters that might be used in a biological attack. Second, the genetic targets for amplification in the biothreat assay are universally conserved, essential to microbial life. This lowers the risk of failed detections because these targets cannot be dispensed with by the microbe and would be difficult to modify by engineering to avoid detection. Third, the comprehensive nature of the biothreat assay enables very broad surveillance of the potential biothreat landscape, including the detection of the virulence plasmids where appropriate. Fourth, the PCR/ESI-MS instrumentation enables very high-throughput sample analysis; the theoretical maximum throughput of the biothreat assay on a current-generation PLEX-ID instrument is approximately 180 specimens over 24 hours.",

In addition, the assay was used to identify Alphavirus directly in mosquitoes and detected an unanticipated Mucambo virus species [12].",

The sensors signaled low-level detections of F. tularensis. Uncertainty as to whether or not there was a biological attack led the CDC to issue an official national health advisory via the health alert network to alert healthcare personnel to possible tularemia exposure (CDCHAN-00238-05-09-30-ADV-N). Specimens analyzed by the primer pairs that comprise the F. tularensis biothreat cluster component of the biothreat assay were used to analyze the air specimens. The results showed that the base composition signature in the extracted air samples had the signature of F. tularensis subsp. novicida, a naturally occurring organism with significantly lower virulence than F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, the main bioagent in the cluster [46]. Thus the detections of F. tularensis observed in these air samples most likely represented detection of a naturally occurring organism. The biothreat assay described here would immediately identify this organism as a near neighbor of a biothreat agent.",

The multiplexed assay was tested with environmental air from Biowatch filters. Feasibility studies were performed at 1000 GE of each target organism spiked into background matrix. The environmental background did not inhibit the ability of PLEX-ID to correctly detect the target organisms. Additional studies were conducted to demonstrate the analytical performance of the assay. These included sensitivity, specificity, linearity, and breadth of coverage of the biothreat clusters. Analytical sensitivity of the target organisms varied between 40\u20131000 GE/well with no false positive detections, and false negative rates below 5% for most organisms tested. The matrix that was used as background had high loads of environmental bacterial signatures (data not shown), including alphaproteobacteria such as Rickettsia and Mesorhizobium species. These might account for the observed higher false positive rates for rickettsial species compared to other organisms. Breadth of coverage and specificity for detection of biothreat agents were determined with Critical Reagents Program (CRP; http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/packs/Default.aspx?pg=1205) reagents. There was an excellent correlation between PLEX-ID identifications and the identity of the spiked strains. Presence of two- to five- fold excess of a near-neighbor organism did not interfere with the detection of the biothreat agent. PLEX-ID assays in general are semi-quantitative at best and have a limited dynamic range for reporting genome levels of detected organisms [4]. The levels of organisms determined using the biothreat assay indicate the approximate genome equivalents/well for the target organism based on relative amplification compared to the calibrant. At higher target organism concentrations, the calibrant is often outcompeted in the PCR reaction, therefore the reported levels at the higher loads were inaccurate. This, however, does not interfere with the ability of the assay to detect the threat agent. In contrast, a specific RT-PCR assay targeting a single organism might be able to provide a measurement over a much larger linear range.",

The method accurately reported each organism with which it was challenged and accurately identified threat species as a threat; species and/or strains that are not considered a threat were not reported as such. The assay is capable of simultaneous detection of most NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens and HHS/USDA select agents and thus provides a means for comprehensive coverage using a high-throughput assay. The validation data support use of the Ibis PLEX-ID and the biothreat assay for detection of biological warfare agents in complex environmental matrices.

The platform analyzes one PCR reaction every 30 seconds in a fully automated modality. The PLEX-ID platform utilizes a novel carousel-based design for the rapid and efficient purification of PCR amplicons.

For this assay, a customized reporting rule set was designed that allowed rapid and accurate detection of the biothreat targets. The biothreat assay report has 21 primer groups or threat clusters as shown in Figure S2. These groups consist of primer pairs used to identify the target biothreat organisms. Each of the threat clusters is treated independently and the results are reported for each cluster separately. Thus, the presence or absence of each of the target biothreat clusters is directly reported. Mixed detections of two or more threats or a threat with an unrelated near neighbor in another group are also reported. Further, two additional metrics (Q-score and level) are provided in the report to assess the quality of the reported detection. The Q-Score is a rating between 0 (low) and 1 (high) of the confidence in the identification of the organism. The Q-Score is based on a number of different parameters such as, the multi-primer joint log likelihood ratio, which is an indicator of how well the hypothesized organisms as a group represent the observed data; the multi-primer single log likelihood ratio, which is an indicator of how significant the contribution of a single organism is to the solution; the fraction of missed detections, which represents the percentage of primers for a detected organism that should have produced known base count compositions, but did not; and, finally, the fraction of no data, which indicates the percentage of primers for a detected organism for which no known data exists within the PLEX-ID system. For the biothreat assay described here, a Q-score \u22650.85 is considered a reportable result. The level is an indication of the amount of the amplicon present in the sample reported as genome equivalents/well. This is calculated with reference to the internal calibrant as described previously [4]. The normal range for reporting these levels is between 0.1\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 the levels of internal controls in the assay, which in the case of the PLEX-ID Biothreat assay represents a working range of \u223c10 GE/well to 1000 GE/well.",
