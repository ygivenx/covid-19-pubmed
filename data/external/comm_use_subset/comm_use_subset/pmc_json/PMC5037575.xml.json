Anti-Nup62 siRNAs, known to inhibit IAV replication2930, were used as a control. The toxicity of siRNA treatment and the silencing efficiency were evaluated as described in the Methods section. No reduction of the cell viability signal was measured compared to control siRNA-treated cells, except in cells silenced for DDX2A, DDX2A + B, DDX39A + B and DDX48 (Figure S1a). Efficient silencing (>70% decrease of the protein expression signal) was achieved for most DDX proteins except for DDX2B, 13, 18, 20, 31 and 52 (16% to 69% decrease) (Figure S1b).",

Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates prepared at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) to monitor the efficiency of viral replication. As shown in Fig. 1a, IAV replication was significantly impaired upon silencing of 14 DDX proteins: DDX3X, DDX5, DDX13, DDX17, DDX19A, DDX19B, DDX24, DDX25, DDX28, DDX31, DDX39B, DDX41, DDX46 and DDX47. Among the DDX proteins that had been previously found to positively regulate IAV replication, DDX3X, DDX5 and DDX1719 and DDX39B15 were recovered in our screen, but not DDX2B, possibly due to low knock-down efficiency (Figure S1b). DDX21 silencing, shown by others to negatively regulate IAV replication14, had no significant effect in our screen. Upon co-silencing of DDX19 A and B forms (96% identity at the protein level), the reduction of luciferase signal was significantly greater than upon silencing of DDX19A or DDX19B alone (a 90% reduction compared to 48% and 59%, respectively, Fig. 1a), indicating a synergistic effect of DDX19A and DDX19B depletion. We repeated the experiment with three individual siRNAs targeting conserved regions between DDX19A and DDX19B (Fig. 1b,c). A strong 76 to 90% reduction of the luciferase signal was observed with all three individual siRNAs (Fig. 1b), thus ruling out any off-target effect. In the experiments described below, the combination of DDX19A and DDX19B siRNAs (thereafter named DDX19 siRNAs) was used.",

At all time points, the WSN virus titers in the supernatant of DDX19-silenced cells were decreased by 2\u20134 log compared to control cells (Fig. 1d). At 24 hpi, similar reductions were observed upon infection with the A/Udorn/307/72(H3N2), A/Paris/908/97(H3N2) or A/Paris/650/2004(H1N1) viruses (Fig. 1e). No reduction was observed with the VSV Indiana strain (Fig. 1f), a negative-stranded RNA virus from the Rhabdoviridae family that replicates in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the production of infectious Adenovirus 5, a double-stranded DNA virus from the Adenoviridae family, was decreased by 1-log upon DDX19 depletion (Fig. 1g). These results confirm that DDX19 is essential for IAV multiplication, and suggest its potential implication in the life cycle of other viruses that replicate in the nucleus.",

The effect on the accumulation of NP and NA vRNAs was delayed, as vRNA levels were strongly reduced at 6 hpi and still so at 9 hpi (5- and 5-fold for NP and 13- and 8-fold for NA at 6 and 9 hpi, respectively) (Fig. 2d,e). We hypothesize that mRNA levels appear less affected at 6 and 9 hpi because their accumulation has plateaued at these time points, unlike the viral vRNAs which continue to accumulate at a high rate. Notably, for each of the vRNA and mRNA species that were examined, the levels measured in DDX19-depleted cells at 6 and 9 hpi were similar to the levels measured in control cells at 3 and 6 hpi, respectively. Taken together, these data indicate that DDX19 silencing does not distinctly affect the process of transcription/replication per se but delays the accumulation of viral RNAs from early time points of infection, which disrupts the whole viral cycle.",

At 2 hpi in control cells, a substantial proportion of each mRNA species (29% to 57%) was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4a, dark grey solid bars). In DDX19-silenced cells, the proportions of cytoplasmic viral mRNAs were strikingly reduced (3% to 8%) (Fig. 4a, light grey solid bars). The sensitivity of the M1- and M2-specific RT-qPCR was insufficient to evaluate accurately the levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear M1 and M2 mRNAs at 2 hpi. At 4 hpi in control cells, the viral mRNAs appeared equally distributed in both fractions (PB2, NP, NA) or predominantly cytoplasmic for NS1 and NS2 mRNAs (Fig. 4b). In contrast, in DDX19-silenced cells, the viral mRNAs remained predominantly nuclear, with only 24% to 34% of the viral mRNAs being detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4b). Although these differences were repeatedly observed (n = 3), the effect of DDX19 silencing at 4 hpi was generally not significant upon statistical analysis.",

To confirm that these activities contribute to DDX19 function in IAV replication, we performed RNAi rescue experiments (Fig. 4c). Upon silencing of DDX19 in HEK-293T cells, siRNA-resistant expression plasmids for the wild-type or mutant DDX19B proteins were transfected. Expression levels of the different DDX19B mutant proteins did not differ significantly (Fig. 4d), and published data indicate that these are properly folded2534. The efficiency of viral replication was then assessed using the WSN-PB2-Nanoluc virus (Fig. 4c). The wild-type DDX19B plasmid (dark grey bar) could rescue >75% of the level of viral replication. This apparent contradiction with the fact that upon depletion, both DDX19A and DDX19B appear to play a role in viral infection (Fig. 1a), is likely due to a high expression level of the recombinant DDX19B protein. Unlike the wild-type DDX19B plasmid (dark grey bar), none of the mutant plasmids tested (R259A, R372A, R428Q, E243Q, and E243Q/V386N, light grey bars) rescued the level of viral replication. Thus all activities related to DDX19B function in nuclear export of mRNAs appear to be required for IAV replication. Taken together with the nuclear retention of viral mRNAs in DDX19 depleted cells, our data clearly establish the essential contribution of DDX19 to the nuclear export of IAV mRNAs.",

The E243Q mutant was shown to be deficient for ATPase activity but, unlike the E243Q-V386N double-mutant, to retain a strong RNA binding activity20. Our data show that these properties result in the stabilization of the DDX19-PB2 interaction.

            "text": "Our study reveals that the cellular DDX19 protein plays an essential role during IAV infection by mediating viral mRNA export. Assuming that the regulatory mechanisms described for the yeast homolog of DDX19 are conserved in humans, DDX19 has a mRNP remodeling activity which depends on its RNA binding activity as well as its NUP214 binding and ATPase activities2728. This is consistent with our observation that DDX19 depletion i) inhibits the nuclear export of IAV mRNAs (Fig. 4a) and ii) leads to a reduction in viral replication that can be rescued by re-expressing the wild-type DDX19 protein, but not any of the mutants defective for RNA binding, NUP214 binding or ATPase activity (Fig. 4c). The effect of DDX19 depletion on the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of viral mRNAs was detectable at 2 hpi and to a lesser extent at 4 hpi (Fig. 4a,b), suggesting that the requirement for DDX19 can be bypassed as viral infection proceeds. The accumulation of high levels of viral mRNAs in the nucleus and/or virus-induced modifications of the cellular environment (e.g. altered permeability of the nuclear envelope45) could allow viral mRNAs to be exported from the nucleus independently of DDX19. Still, in DDX19-depleted cells the inhibition of viral mRNA export at early time points results in a considerably delayed viral life cycle. By impairing the production of viral RNAs and viral proteins (Fig. 2), it strongly reduces the production of infectious virus particles as observed with several IAV strains (Fig. 1e). A possible role of DDX19 in the life cycle of other viruses that replicate in nucleus such as adenoviruses (Fig. 1g) or retroviruses46 deserves further exploration.",

            "text": "The other major player that has been involved in IAV mRNA export so far is the Nuclear Export Factor 1 (NXF1), also known as TAP1835. It has been suggested that the intronless, unspliced, and spliced viral mRNAs may harbor differential dependence on NXF1 and/or use distinct adaptors to recruit NXF11847. The three types of viral mRNAs were included in our study. They were all found to depend on DDX19 for their nuclear export (Fig. 4a) and to associate specifically with DDX19 in infected cells (Fig. 5c). Based on the available structural data, DDX19 seems to bind RNA in a non sequence-specific manner, as most contacts are made with the sugar-phosphate backbone2834. It is unknown whether small RNAs such as microRNAs and tRNAs, or mRNPs transported by CRM1 rely on DDX19 for their nuclear export2348. It is also unclear whether all mRNPs transported by NXF1 undergo DDX19-mediated remodeling, or whether DDX19 is directed to specific mRNPs by adaptor proteins. To our knowledge the only documented case of such an adaptor is the SLIP1 protein, which binds DDX19 and could specifically target it to histone mRNAs49. Here, using iPCA (Fig. 5e and ref. 29) and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5a), we demonstrate a physical interaction between the viral polymerase and DDX19 in the context of infected cells. We show that this interaction is RNA-independent (Fig. 5a). However, viral mRNAs can be co-purified with the polymerase-DDX19 complex (Fig. 5a,b), suggesting that DDX19 is recruited to viral mRNAs through its interaction with the viral polymerase. Interestingly, the DDX19-polymerase interaction signal was higher in the presence of a E243Q DDX19 mutant able to bind RNA but deficient for ATPase activity20, which presumably compromises its ability to remodel exported mRNPs by dissociating RNA-binding protein components from the mRNPs5051 (Fig. 5e). This observation suggests that the polymerase-DDX19-mRNA complex is transient and that the viral polymerase dissociates upon ATP hydrolysis-driven remodeling of viral mRNPs, in line with a previous report that viral mRNAs do not stably associate with the viral polymerase in infected cells52.",

One model proposes that the GLE1 nucleoporin ensures loading of DDX19-ATP onto the mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, where ATP hydrolysis-driven remodeling of mRNPs occurs27. A second model proposes that mRNPs are initially bound to DDX19-ATP and remodeled upon ATP hydrolysis, after which GLE1 stimulates the release of mRNPs from DDX19-ADP28. Our in cellulo observations are clearly in favor of the second model, which is also supported by the existence of an intranuclear pool of DDX19 that can associate with mRNPs and with the cellular transcription machinery2253. The binding of IAV polymerase to the C-terminal domain of cellular RNA polymerase II early in infection54 might facilitate its association with DDX19 and thus the loading of DDX19 (possibly co-transcriptionally) onto viral mRNPs.",
