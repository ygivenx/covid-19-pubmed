There are two major groups of retrotransposons that are distinguishable by the presence or absence of long terminal repeats (LTRs). LTR-retrotransposons include human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) as well as murine intracisternal A-particle (IAP) and MusD sequences [reviewed in (8\u201310)]. Endogenous LTR-retrotransposons are structurally similar to retroviruses, but generally lack or contain a defective envelope (env) gene, which relegates them to intracellular replication [reviewed in (11)]. While HERVs appear to be inactive in the human genome, it is estimated that \u223c300 copies of IAP and 10 copies of MusD remain functional in the mouse genome (12\u201314).",

            "text": "The host cell has evolved various strategies to regulate retrotransposon activity at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels [reviewed in (7)]. For example, retrotransposon-derived Piwi interacting RNAs, in conjunction with Piwi proteins, can degrade L1 and other transposable element transcripts in the germ line of mice and flies, and they are thought to be involved in the epigenetic silencing of retrotransposons via promoter methylation in murine embryonic male germ cells [reviewed in (44,45)]. It also is proposed that hybridization of the L1 sense and antisense transcripts may serve as double-strand RNA triggers for Dicer-dependent RNA interference mediated regulation of L1 retrotransposition (46), although this supposition requires further study. Besides these small RNA-based inhibition pathways, L1 retrotransposition can be inhibited by several proteins, including the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme 3 (APOBEC3) family of cytidine deaminases [reviewed in (47)], Trex1 (48) and MOV10 (49\u201351). Recent evidence also suggests the ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein may limit the length and/or number of engineered L1 retrotransposition events in cultured cells (52). In addition, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) binds L1 RNA and interferes with L1 retrotransposition (53,54). HnRNPL and several other cellular inhibitors of L1 retrotransposition were also identified in the L1 ORF1 protein interactome (54). In contrast, the poly(A) binding protein C1 was recently shown to promote L1 retrotransposition (55).",

The OAS genes encode IFN inducible enzymes that are expressed at basal levels in many mammalian cell types (57). Viral dsRNAs activate OAS-1, -2 and -3, which use ATP to generate 2-5A molecules with the following structures: [px5\u2032A(2\u2032p5\u2032A)n; x = 1\u20133; n \u2265 2] (58). The 2-5A then binds to the ankyrin repeat domain of latent RNase L, causing it to form an enzymatically active dimer (59). Active RNase L cleaves single-strand regions of viral and cellular RNA, suppressing viral protein synthesis, replication and spread [reviewed in (56)]. Moreover, cleavage products generated by RNase L, mostly short duplex RNAs with 3\u2032-phosphoryl groups, can bind and activate the RIG-I and MDA5 helicases (60). Interaction of these helicases with the mitochondrial adapter MAVS then results in a signaling cascade, allowing type I IFN production (60). The prolonged activation of RNase L results in cell death through apoptosis, leading to the elimination of virus-infected cells (61\u201363).",

Here we demonstrate that wild type (WT) RNase L and a constitutively active (N\u0394385) RNase L mutant potently restrict both L1 and IAP retrotransposition in cultured human cells. In contrast, RNase L (R667A), catalytically inactive due to a mutation in the active site, does not restrict L1 or IAP retrotransposition. Consistent with the above observations, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous RNase L leads to a \u223c2-fold increase in L1 retrotransposition. Finally, the expression of active forms of RNase L, but not the R667A RNase L mutant, leads to the degradation of L1 mRNA, which, in turn, leads to a decrease in the expression of L1 ORF1p and ORF2p. Thus, in addition to its role in restricting the infectivity of several viruses, RNase L may act to restrict the retrotransposition of certain endogenous retrotransposons.",

Briefly, HeLa-M cells, which are deficient in endogenous RNase L expression (71) (Figure 3C, Lane 1), were co-transfected with either an engineered retrotransposon [human L1 pJM101/L1.3 (20)] or mouse IAP [pDJ33/440N1neoTNF (13)] and either an empty vector (pFLAG-CMV-2) or a plasmid that expresses an amino-terminal FLAG-tagged version of RNase L [WT RNase L, a catalytically inactive RNase L mutant (R667A), or constitutively active (N\u0394385) RNase L mutant (70)]. While the HeLa-M cells used in this study are deficient in RNase L, it should be noted that other types of HeLa cells (including ATCC CCL-2 and S3) express normal levels of endogenous RNase L (77,78). Both the L1 and IAP constructs contain a retrotransposition indicator cassette in their 3\u2032 ends (Figure 1). The indicator cassette consists of either an antisense copy of a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (mneoI) or an enhanced green fluorescent protein-coding gene (mEGFPI) equipped with a heterologous promoter (Pr\u2032) and polyadenylation signal (lollipop symbol, Figure 1A) (41,65,79). Notably, both the mneoI and mEGFPI indicator cassettes are disrupted by an intron [IVS2 of the \u03b3-globin gene in the L1 constructs (41) and intron 2 of the murine tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF-\u03b2) gene in the IAP construct (80)] that is in the same transcriptional orientation as the L1 or IAP retrotransposon. This arrangement ensures that the reporter gene only will become activated and expressed if the retrotransposon RNA is reverse transcribed and integrated into genomic DNA (Figure 1B). The resultant numbers of G418-resistant foci or EGFP-positive cells serve as a read out of L1 or IAP retrotransposition efficiency (Figure 1C) (41,65).",

In contrast, the FLAG-tagged catalytically inactive RNase L mutant (R667A) did not significantly inhibit L1 retrotransposition (Figure 2A and B). As a positive control, we demonstrated that the expression of a FLAG-tagged A3A protein reduced L1 retrotransposition by \u223c50%. The lower level of A3A expression (Figure 2C) may lead to its reduced suppression of L1 retrotransposition when compared with previous studies (68,81). As a negative control, we demonstrated that the expression of FLAG-tagged RIG-I protein (82), a pathogen recognition receptor for viral RNA, had no significant effect on L1 retrotransposition. Western blot analyses confirmed that FLAG-tagged RNase L, A3A and RIG proteins were expressed in Hela-M cells (Figure 2C). Moreover, the expression of the RNase L proteins did not significantly impact cell viability (Figure 3). To corroborate the above findings, we next tested whether the expression of FLAG-tagged WT RNase L, constitutively active RNase L mutant (N\u0394385) and catalytically inactive RNase L mutant (R667A) proteins could inhibit the mobility of an engineered human L1 that contains the mEGFPI-based retrotransposition cassette located in the 3\u2032-UTR (Figure 1A; pLRE3-mEGFPI) (19,65). Once again, we found that both the WT and N\u0394385 RNase L proteins inhibited L1 retrotransposition and that the catalytically inactive R667A RNase L mutant did not (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S1). The control plasmid (pJM111-LRE3-mEGFPI), which carries two missense mutations in ORF1p rendering it inactive, showed only background EGFP expression. Western blot analyses confirmed that the epitope-tagged RNase L and A3A proteins were expressed (Figure 4B). Notably, the decrease in retrotransposition efficiency (\u223c50%) caused by RNase L expression was less pronounced in the EGFP-based retrotransposition assays when compared with the mneoI-based retrotransposition assay. These differences may be due to the shorter time duration of the mEGFPI-based retrotransposition assays (6 days) when compared with mneoI-based (12 day) assays.\n\n\n",

Hey1b cells express relatively high levels of RNase L typical of some human cancer cell lines, in contrast, RNase L is barely detectable in HeLa-M cells (71). Western blot analyses, using a monoclonal antibody that detects endogenous RNase L, revealed that cells transfected with an siRNA pool that targets RNase L exhibited an \u223c90% reduction in endogenous RNase L protein levels when compared with cells transfected with a control siRNA pool (Figure 5A). Reduction of the endogenous RNase L protein level was evident 24 h after transfection and was maintained for \u223c96 h (data not shown). Retrotransposition assays using pLRE3-mEGFPI (19,65) revealed that \u223c0.4% of cells treated with control siRNA became EGFP-positive after 4 days of puromycin drug selection (Figure 5B and C and Supplementary Figure S2), which enriched for cells containing the L1 expression plasmid. In contrast, \u223c0.75% of cells treated with siRNA against RNase L were EGFP-positive (Figure 5B and C). As expected, the retrotransposition-defective L1 (pJM111-LRE3-mEGFPI) only exhibited background EGFP expression levels regardless of RNase L depletion (Figure 5B).\n",

To accomplish this goal, we designed primers that would amplify a 91-bp fragment that spans the junction of the ORF2/TAP-tag coding region in a transfected L1 expression construct (pAD2TE1) (66). Notably, these primers should specifically amplify L1 mRNA derived from pAD2TE1 and should not amplify endogenous L1 mRNAs, which lack the TAP epitope-tag at the end of the ORF2 coding sequence. Primers capable of amplifying mRNA from the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (HYG) present on the pCEP4 L1 expression plasmid backbone served as an internal/normalization control. [The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy is illustrated in Figure 1A, see PCR primers beneath the map of pAD2TE1.] Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that the expression of WT RNase L reduced L1 mRNA levels by \u223c80% (Figure 7A). However, expression of the catalytically inactive R667A RNase L mutant failed to significantly reduce L1 mRNA levels (Figure 7A). In a separate control experiment, we demonstrated that co-transfection of WT RNase L did not affect HYG mRNA levels expressed from pIREShyg (Clontech) (Supplementary Figure S3). These data suggest that RNase L preferentially targets L1 mRNA for degradation, and that its nuclease activity is required for the decrease in L1 mRNA levels.\n",

To visualize the L1 mRNA, we took advantage of a previously described construct, pAD3TE1, which encodes an L1 element that contains 24 copies of MS2 RNA binding element in its 3\u2032-UTR (Figure 1A) (66). The co-expression of pAD3TE1 and a plasmid encoding a nuclear localized MS2-GFP protein would allow the MS2-GFP protein to bind the MS2 RNA sequences in pAD3TE1 mRNA, allowing the indirect visualization of the L1 mRNA via immunofluorescent confocal microscopy (66). We observed punctate L1 cytoplasmic foci in cells co-transfected with pAD3TE1, the MS2-GFP protein expression construct and either the empty vector pcDNA 3.0 or the inactive RNase L R667A mutant (Figure 7B). In contrast, we did not observe punctate L1 cytoplasmic foci in cells co-transfected with pAD3TE1, the MS2-GFP protein expression construct and the WT RNase L expression construct (\u223c200 cells were examined per slide and representative images were captured) (Figure 7B). As an additional control for this experiment, we determined that EBNA-1, which is present on the backbone of the pAD3TE1 expression vector, was still expressed in the presence of WT RNase L. Together, these data indicate a ribonuclease-dependent effect of RNase L on L1 RNA levels and likely explain, in part, how RNase L adversely affects L1 retrotransposition.",

Because the expression of RNase L adversely affected L1 mRNA levels and, in turn, ORF1p and ORF2p protein accumulation, we next examined whether RNase L expression adversely affects L1 cytoplasmic foci accumulation. To accomplish this goal, we co-transfected HeLa-M cells with an L1 expression vector (pES2TE1) (66) including an HA-tagged ORF2p, and an empty vector (pcDNA 3.0), a plasmid expressing the amino-terminal Myc-tagged WT RNase L or a catalytically inactive R667A RNase L mutant expression construct. Consistent with the findings reported above, immunofluorescent confocal microscopy revealed the presence of ORF2p cytoplasmic foci in the presence of the empty vector and the catalytically inactive R667A RNase L mutant expression construct (Figure 9). In contrast, L1 ORF2p foci were not observed on co-expression of WT RNase L.\n",

Conversely, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous RNase L increased L1 retrotransposition by \u223c87% (Figure 5). Regarding our IAP results, while there are limitations in drawing conclusions from cross species transfection experiments, our findings suggest a relatively general role for RNase L in restricting retrotransposons that have different integration mechanisms.

In addition, it is unknown if R667A also affects RNA binding, but if it does it could explain why the catalytically inactive mutant cannot be co-localized with L1 RNA. The expression of WT RNase L, as well as a constitutively active RNase L mutant (N\u0394385), led to a reduction in L1 RNA levels; this reduction, in turn, led to a decrease in both ORF1p and ORF2p expression (Figures 7, 8 and 9).

However, the structural context of the RNA substrate greatly influences the choice of cleavage sites (90). Certain viral and cellular single-strand RNAs are subject to degradation. For example, ribosomal RNA present in intact ribosomes can be cleaved by RNase L producing a characteristic pattern of discrete products in some IFN-treated and virus-infected cells (91,92). The molecular mechanism by which RNase L targets L1 RNA requires further study. We hypothesize that double-stranded structures (e.g. stem loops) within L1 RNA may activate OAS to produce microdomains of 2-5A (an activator of RNase L) from ATP. Alternatively, RNAs produced from the L1 sense and antisense promoters (SP and ASP, respectively) (46) may hybridize to form a region of dsRNA that activates OAS (46,93). This proposed localized activation of OAS, and RNase L may then result in the targeted degradation of L1 RNA.",

For example, it previously was hypothesized that partially double-stranded RNAs, such as replicative intermediates from certain picornaviruses including encephalomyocarditis virus, could lead to localized OAS-RNase L activation (94,95). RNAs linked to double-strand RNA were preferentially degraded by RNase L when compared with single-stranded RNAs lacking a double-strand segment (94). By analogy, there is evidence for another localized activation model involving production of a different small molecule second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The distribution in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes of enzymes that synthesize and degrade cAMP produce microdomains of cAMP that specifically activate a subset of localized protein kinase A molecules (96). Thus, in principle, 2-5A microdomains would form near the sites of OAS complexed with its RNA activators. Within these 2-5A microdomains, RNase L would become active causing cleavage of the RNA stimulators of OAS, in this case L1 RNA. This model could be relevant to both retrotransposition and viral infections and warrants further investigation. Finally, it is noteworthy that RNase L may not be the only host protein that regulates L1 retrotransposition by nucleic acid degradation. For example, it is hypothesized that the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease Trex1 inhibits L1 retrotransposition by degrading L1 cDNA intermediates (48).",

First, the degradation of L1 RNA by WT or constitutively active RNase L would be predicted to inhibit the formation of L1 RNPs, thereby hampering the visualization of co-localized foci. Second, the inability to observe co-localization of L1 cytoplasmic foci with the catalytically inactive R667A RNase L mutant could reflect the transient nature of the association of RNase L with its RNA substrate (97). Similarly, the absence of RNase L in the interactome from isolated L1 ORF1 protein and its RNPs is not inconsistent with a transient interaction between in L1 RNA and RNase L (54). Lastly, it remains possible that the ectopic expression of RNase L leads to an artifactual degradation of L1 RNA. However, this scenario is unlikely because RNase L did not inhibit HYG mRNA production or EGFP protein production, and siRNA-mediated depletion of RNase L from Hey1b cell led to a modest increase in L1 retrotransposition (Figures 5, 7A and 8B).",

Mutations in RNase L discovered from linkage analysis include two protein inactivating mutations (\u0394157-164X and E265X), a mutation that abrogates translation (M1I) and a missense variant 1385G\u2192A (R462Q) that reduce RNase L activity by 3-fold (99). The connection between RNase L and prostate cancer was further expanded to other types of cancer. Genetic variations in RNASEL have been identified in cancers of head and neck, uterus, cervix and breast (100). They are also associated with disease aggressiveness and metastasis in familial pancreatic cancer (101) and with age of onset of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (102).",

However, inconsistent findings on the same RNASEL mutations among studies, some that show an association with cancer and others that do not, suggest that RNase L might act as a modifier of disease progression with possible interactions between environmental factors and genetics [reviewed in (99,106)]. In this regard, it would be interesting to see if a loss of RNase L activity correlates with an increase in L1 retrotransposition activity in certain tumors. Recent studies have shown somatic L1 retrotransposition activity in a subset of colorectal, liver and lung tumors (107\u2013110).",

            "text": "Figure 1.: An overview of the L1 and IAP retrotransposition assays. (A) Schematics of L1 and IAP constructs: The L1 and IAP constructs contain a NEO-based (mneoI) or EGFP-based (mEGFPI) retrotransposition indicator cassette near their 3\u2032 ends. The indicator cassettes are in an anti-sense (backward) orientation relative to the transcriptional orientation of the L1 or IAP elements. The indicator cassettes also contain an intron that is in the same transcriptional orientation as the retroelement. SD and SA indicate the splice donor and splice acceptor sites of the intron, respectively. Pr\u2032 indicates the promoter driving the expression of the retrotransposition indicator cassette. Closed lollipops indicate the polyadenylation signal on the indicator cassette. A CMV promoter enhances the expression of the pJM101/L1.3, pAD2TE1, pES2TE1 and pAD3TE1 L1 vectors. An SV40 polyadenylation signal is present at the 3\u2032 end of each L1 expression cassette. Notably, the mneoI-based L1 vectors are expressed from a pCEP4 vector that contains a HYG and an EBNA-1 gene. The mEGFPI-based L1 vectors are expressed from a pCEP4 vector that was modified to contain a PURO gene; it also contains the EBNA-1 gene. Flag symbols indicate the names of epitope-tags present in some L1 vectors. The SP and ASP labels indicate the sense and anti-sense promoters located in the L1 5\u2032-UTR. The MS2 24x designation indicates the 24 copies of the MS2-GFP RNA binding motif in the pAD3TE1 construct. The PCR primers for pAD2TE1 are labeled F1, R1, F2 and R2 (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section for details). In the IAP vector [pDJ33/440N1neoTNF (13)], Pr indicates the viral LTR promoter. The IAP GAG and POL genes also are indicated. (B) Rationale of the assay: Transcription from a promoter driving L1 or IAP expression allows splicing of the intron from either the mneoI- or EGFP-based indicator cassettes. Retrotransposition of the resultant RNA leads to activation of the reporter gene, conferring either G418-resistance or EGFP-positivity to host cells. TSD indicates a target site duplication flanking the retrotransposed L1. (C) Experimental protocols to detect L1 retrotransposition: Cells were co-transfected with an engineered L1 or IAP retroelement and either an empty vector (pFLAG-CMV-2) or amino-terminal FLAG-tagged RNase L expression plasmid. For the mneoI-based assays, the transfected cells were subjected to G418 selection 2 days after transfection. The numbers of G418-resistant foci serve as a readout of retrotransposition efficiency. For the mEGFPI-based assays, FACS analysis was used to measure the percentage of EGFP-positive cells 4 days after transfection (See \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section for further details about each assay).",
