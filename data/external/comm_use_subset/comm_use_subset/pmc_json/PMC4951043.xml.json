There has been some discussion about the geographical heterogeneity of disease transmission in the three hardest hit countries in West Africa [1\u20138], but other studies have not considered this effect in their analysis. An epidemic of this scale has an intrinsic multi-level structure and national epidemic curves are always an overlay of local outbreaks [9\u201311]. Consequently, the estimation of national transmission offers little information about subnational dynamics. The availability of district-level data provides a unique opportunity to investigate local disease transmission during the 2013\u20132015 epidemic. We may also use these data to quantify population-level risk factors for EVD transmission. Demographic or behavioural factors such as crowding and high population density, low socioeconomic status (SES), unsafe burials or poor sanitation but also climate effects might have contributed to enhanced EVD transmission in West Africa, but these effects have been assessed only in a limited number of studies [1,7,11,12]. In the context of recurrent infectious diseases, increased human mobility and globalisation the quantification of subnational spread of EVD and the investigation of factors related to the spread might provide insights that could improve epidemic management in the future [5].",

            "text": "The most frequently used parameter for quantifying transmissibility is the basic reproduction number R0, which describes the average number of secondary infections generated by a primary case during the initial phase of an outbreak when the population is completely susceptible and no control measures have been employed [13]. A common approach to the estimation of R0 consists of fitting mathematical transmission models to observed outbreak data. In the West African EVD epidemic, several mathematical modelling studies have described the variation in R0 between [6,10,14\u201319] and within [20\u201325] the three countries. Most studies found estimates of R0 ranging between 1.5 and 2.5, agreeing with results from models of earlier outbreaks ranging from 1.4\u20134.7 (summarised in [26]). A drawback of mechanistic models is the requirement of a large number of parameters, which is problematic with sparse data [27]. As an alternative to mechanistic models, R0 can be inferred from the generation time and the intrinsic growth rate r (sometimes also referred to as \u0245) during the early, exponential epidemic phase [13]. The generation time is the average interval between infection of a primary and a secondary case. The growth rate r is defined as the per capita change in case numbers per time unit. It can be calculated directly from the observed empirical data by estimating the slope of the natural log-transformed cumulative case counts over time with a linear regression model [28,29] or by fitting an exponential or sigmoid curve to incident case counts [27,30]. The use of incident case data is generally preferred over cumulative case data because the individual observations are statistically independent [1]. Ignoring the dependence of measurement error in cumulative cases can lead to over-optimistic standard errors and thus underestimation of uncertainty in epidemic growth [31]. This statistical approach is particularly useful for the assessment of smaller outbreaks with sparse data [27], as observed in certain districts during the West African EVD epidemic. The analysis of local transmissibility should take into account the hierarchical nature of subnational data, because these cases are not completely independent but arise from a common population i.e. country. Such an epidemic structure can be approached with a mixed effects model, which explicitly allows for clustering.",

These weekly case counts were aggregated from the patient database and are considered to be more reliable for the early phase of the epidemic than the situation reports issued by the Ministries of Health of the affected countries [33]. We calculated the total incident cases for each week as the sum of confirmed and probable incident cases. To take account of recurrent outbreaks we defined epidemic waves within each district. A wave was considered terminated after a period of 42 days with no new cases, corresponding to twice the maximum incubation period [34]. New cases arising after this period were considered as a new wave. To ensure a minimum number of data points in each district for the fitting process, we restricted our analysis to the first wave with three or more non-zero data points. Districts with fewer than three non-zero data points per wave were excluded. We restricted the time variable to the first eight weeks since onset of a wave in each district, corresponding to approximately four serial intervals [34]. This time period was considered long enough to have a sufficient number of time points and reduce initial stochasticity, but short enough to capture only the initial exponential phase and exclude the effects of control measures or natural attenuation of the epidemic. The comparison of the dates of epidemic onset and the opening dates of Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs, see [35,36]) showed that only 9% of all districts had a functioning ETU in the first eight weeks since onset of the selected wave.",

We used a generalised linear mixed effects model (GLMM) comprising both fixed and random effects, which explicitly allows for clustering in the data [37]. Such a hierarchical model allows the mean values to vary between the different countries, but borrows information across the districts within a country. The weekly number of new infections cijk in district i in country j at time-point tijk was assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean \u03bbijk and was modelled with the logarithm as the link function:\ncijk~ Pois(\u03bbijk)\nln(\u03bbijk)=(\u03b20j+b0ij)+(\u03b21j+b1ij)*tijk\n(b0ijb1ij) ~ N2((00),(\u03c402\u03c1\u03c40\u03c41\u03c1\u03c40\u03c41\u03c402))(1)\nThis means we assume country level intercepts \u03b20j and slopes \u03b21j, which are modelled as fixed effects. The district specific intercepts \u03b20j\n+ b0ij and slopes \u03b21j\n+ b1ij are assumed to be normally distributed around these country level average values. For simplicity, we assume the heterogeneity between the district-level intercepts (\u03c402) and slopes (\u03c412) as well as their correlation (\u03c1) to be the same for all countries. The model was fitted using maximum likelihood estimation. We then used the posterior means of the random effects (empirical Bayes means) to calculate the growth rates r for each district i in country j, given by\nrij =  \u03b21j  +  b1ij(2)",

The use of a generalised linear mixed model provides a simple but elegant solution for a geographically complex and hierarchical epidemic structure and yielded plausible values of transmissibility. As shown in our sensitivity analysis, the length of the time window for the exponential phase did not affect the estimates of R0 substantially. The selection of the time interval to be included should be based on considerations about the generation time, the number of data points available and knowledge about the time point of control interventions. Our approach has three main limitations, two related to data quality and one to the choice of methods. First, the reliability of the data collected at the beginning of the epidemic is uncertain [46]. Reporting delays and underreporting could have led to the underestimation of the incidence. Delays in updating the patient database do not affect our analysis because we included only the initial data points for each district. Underreporting of cases was estimated to be 17 to 70% [47]. If underreporting remains constant throughout the observed time period, R0 is unaffected, because the exponential growth rate does not change. The assumption of proportional underreporting seems reasonable for the initial phase of two months even if it does not hold throughout the epidemic. Due to the lack of data on dynamic underreporting, we did not consider this aspect in our analysis. Second, our assumption about the absence of control measures might not be true. Local outbreaks occurred at different time points of the epidemic. Immediate implementation of control measures or increased public awareness in later outbreaks could have biased estimates of the initial epidemic growth downwards for districts affected towards the end of 2014. We think that the effect of these interventions was negligible during the first two months of an outbreak because, even by early October 2014, only a few districts had managed to implement fully functioning control measures such as safe burials and contact tracing [48] and most ETUs opened more than eight weeks after onset of the epidemic in a district. Third, our approach does not take into account the spatial dependence of cases and in theory the geographical location of cases is exchangeable within a country in our model. Spatial autocorrelation models require a spatial weights matrix, which is derived using geographical information, and are conceptually more complex than normal regression models. We aimed to establish a simple model, which can be used when limited geographical information is available but which still includes the hierarchical aspect of spatially heterogeneous epidemics. This analysis also has a limited spatial resolution due to the availability of data and cannot capture heterogeneities at a finer scale. The assumption of homogeneous population mixing within a district is clearly unrealistic. However, the trade-off between higher spatial resolution and lower case numbers is not straightforward. Chiefdom-level data may provide a better picture of local dynamics but are not publicly available.",

Four studies using different phylodynamic models based on patient samples taken in a hospital in Kenema have given estimates of R0 between 1.26 and 2.40 [23\u201325,47]. Our estimate of 1.65 (95% CI 1.27\u20132.03) is within this range. For Montserrado, we estimated an R0 of 2.07 (95% CI 1.41\u20132.74), which lies between the published estimates of 1.73 and 2.49 [21,22]. For Conakry, our model yielded a lower value (1.15, 95% CI 0.80\u20131.51) than that calculated from reconstructed transmission chains (1.7) for the time period of March 2014 [20] but was close to the overall value of 0.95 estimated from a re-analysis of the same data [49]. The finding that many districts experienced an outbreak that was characterised by an R0<1 supports the hypothesis of heterogeneous contact networks [4,11]. Clustered transmission and superspreading has been confirmed by several studies [20,25,47] and can lead to outbreaks even if R0 is below unity [49]. Assuming that our approach is an adequate model of this hierarchical epidemic, we may conclude that subnational transmissibility might not have been as high as previously thought. At national level, our approach was not comparable to results of other methods. Several mechanistic [6,10,14,16\u201319,50\u201352] and phenomenological [15,34,53] models have provided estimates of R0 ranging from 1.51 (95% CI 1.50\u20131.52) to 2.46 (95% CI 1.44\u20132.01) for Guinea, from 1.54 to 2.5 (95% CI 2.4\u20132.7) for Liberia and from 1.26 to 8.33 for Sierra Leone. Our estimates of 0.97 (95% CI 0.77\u20131.18) for Guinea, of 1.26 (95% CI 0.98\u20131.55) for Liberia and of 1.66 (95% CI 1.43\u20132.00) for Sierra Leone are consistently lower than all published values. These differences might reflect the fact that our national estimates of R0 result from an averaged growth rate of multiple local outbreaks occurring at different time points, whilst other studies used the national epidemic curves to fit their models.",

            "text": "The ecological analysis showed associations between R0 and population-level factors linked to urbanisation and crowding. Analysis at the population-level is appropriate when the mechanism of action involves interactions between individuals, for example the potential for spread of an infection in densely populated areas [54]. Nevertheless, the risk of an individual of becoming infected cannot be predicted from the population density of their household or community. Whether the positive association between crowding and EVD transmissibility is also observed at a lower level of administrative unit cannot be inferred from this analysis. Fallah et al used individual data on EVD cases and their contacts and determined SES-stratified measures of transmission [12]. They found that cases from middle and low SES communities caused significantly more secondary cases than infected individuals from high SES communities. These findings appear contradictory to our study, but can be explained by the different levels of data and different definitions of the SES. While our SES variable considers housing properties and household assets, Fallah et al also included high population density in the definition of low SES. Considering these differences, both studies are consistent with the hypothesis that large-scale crowding contributed to EVD transmission. Other factors that could influence the transmissibility could not be considered in this analysis due to lack of data. Behavioural factors such as community resistance or superspreading events like unsafe burials [55] might have had a strong impact on EVD spread. Some of our estimates may be large by chance due to the stochastic nature of the outbreaks. Biological factors such as differences in host or viral genetics are probably less important in this population and this time frame. Our findings are compatible with theory about drivers of infectious diseases, but the contribution of different factors cannot be answered completely with this study design and these data.",
