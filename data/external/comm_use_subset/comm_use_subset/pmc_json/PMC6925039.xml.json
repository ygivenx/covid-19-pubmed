            "text": "Avian coronavirus is the main representative of genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales [1]. Within the avian coronavirus group, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is among the most researched. This virus is known to cause an important disease that incurs a high economic loss in the poultry industry [2,3] despite an ongoing vaccination program. It causes respiratory disease while also affecting the kidneys and reproductive tract [4] through viremia with a severity that differs depending on serotypes [3]. Mutations and recombination have produced a high genetic diversity of the virus. In addition, vaccinations performed in the farm setting can influence the evolution of the virus [5]. Many serotypes of IBV are often not cross-protective [6,7]. Mismatching between the circulating strain and the administered vaccine may contribute to vaccination failure [7]. Ubiquitous IBV and IBV-like viruses have also been found in species other than chicken, such as in peafowl, guinea fowl, partridge, waterfowl, and teal [2,6,8-10]. This finding strengthens the possibility that IBV may have a wider range of hosts than previously thought [8,6]. Despite this, data relating to IBV in Indonesia is still limited to poultry. Studies of diseases on endemic species are valuable for the conservation effort, yet are rarely conducted.",

Visually captivating, with both male and female showing radically different plumage, the Eclectus parrot is naturally talkative and popular as a pet [11]. However, there has been limited information about viral diseases among Eclectus parrots. The latest finding on coronavirus in parrots was in 2006 when a virus distinct from IBV was found in the green-cheeked Amazon parrot [12].

Of the two that tested positive for the S1 gene of IBV, only one of them, which was designated as parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16, was able to be further sequenced. These results are presented in Table-3.",

Advances in genetic identification by biomolecular technologies allow rapid identification of viruses without the need for prior isolation. However, the question remains as to whether these novel viruses cause disease in the species that they were found [8,3]. There have been few instances where isolates were obtained, such as a virus that was found in peafowl that was found to share >99% identity with H120 IBV vaccines [18] and Mass-type IBV [19]. A coronavirus detected in pigeons was found to be clustered as a Mass-type IBV [20], whereas a coronavirus found in teal has been shown to exhibit >80% genetic similarity with several IBV strains including infectious strains [21]. Interestingly, upon exposure to chickens, the peafowl IB-like virus, which is close to IBV vaccine strain H120, did not cause disease among these birds [18], whereas the IB-like Mass-type peafowl isolate, the IB-like Mass-type pigeon isolate, and the IB-like teal isolate caused infection in chickens [19,20,21]. These previous studies indicate that the IB-like virus may be found in hosts other than chickens and that they might originate from the chicken IBV or might be a novel virus. However, unless this is investigated further, it is uncertain whether the viruses found in other species of birds can cause disease in chickens.",

The nucleotide sequence of the partial S1 gene used in this study (XCE2+/XCE2\u2212) only covers the hypervariable region (HVR)-3 of the S1 gene [22] but does not cover HVR 1 and HVR 2. This present study indicated that within the section of the parrot/Indonesia/BX9/16 gene that was sequenced, there was 100% similarity with several IBV 4/91 strains taken from GenBank, which included both infectious and vaccine strains, namely: IBV strain 4/91 variant 1 Israel (AF093794.1), 4/91 vaccine strain (KF377577.1), CK/CH/YN/SL 1301-1 (KX107779.1), chicken/Attock/NARC-786/2013 (KU145467.1), and gammaCoV/Ck/Poland/G193/2015 (MK576138.1). Recent publications regarding IBV in Indonesia by Wibowo et al. [17] and Setiawaty et al. [22] showed the presence of a circulating infectious 4/91 strain in Indonesia. Sequences obtained from Wibowo et al. [17] were 4/91-like IBV originating from Indonesia in 2017 to 2018. These sequences were included in our phylogenetic analysis but appeared to be slightly different from our isolated virus in each of the nucleotides numbered: 55, 80, 98, 175, 211, 223, and 225. However, two sequences from Setiawaty et al. [22] showed 100% similarity (Indonesia/K233A31/18 and Indonesia/K4A9/17) to our isolated gene and only one slight variation compared with their Indonesia/P3/17 gene. The study by Setiawaty et al. [22] showed that the 4/91 gene recovered from an outbreak may show sequence homology to the live vaccine. The study by Wibowo et al. [17] was conducted in East Java, while the study by Setiawaty et al. [22] was conducted in West Java, which is in close proximity to the place that this research was conducted. This might explain why, in our study, we were able to isolate an IB-like virus that was close in homology to the IBV 4/91 strain. This also indicates that the 4/91 strain is widespread in Java Island, Indonesia.",

            "text": "According to Valastro et al. [16], the IBV 4/91 strain and 793.B belong to the IBV GI-13 lineage. This lineage is among the most widely distributed lineage in the world. This has mostly contributed to the widespread usage of vaccinations [16]. However, in Indonesia, vaccines commonly used in poultry are from the GI-1 lineage, which consists of Mass-type IBV such as M41, H52, or H120 strains [17,22]. Information dating back to 1977 and 1985 states that at that time, circulating IBV in Indonesia was close to the IBV Massachusetts, IBV Connecticut, and Australian strains [23]. The IBV variant strain was first detected in Indonesia in 2003 [24]. A recent study of circulating IBV in outbreaks among chickens in Indonesia showed that the virus isolated in 2012 in East Java was Qx-like and was similar to China and Taiwan strains in 2017 [25]; whereas, IBV isolated in 2018 was found to be close in similarity to the IB 4/91 strain [17,22]. In general, IBV strains within the same serotype share >95% amino acid similarity and those with <85% similarity usually belong to different strains [2]. A slight change in the S1 gene may affect the serotype of the virus and cross-protection [2,6]. This could probably explain why our virus was similar to vaccine and field viruses at the same time. Despite the viruses having 100% homology on the site we sequenced, differences in other parts of the genome may cause differences in virulence. Considering how 100% homology was obtained with both the vaccine virus and field strains, it is difficult to determine the origin or infectivity of the virus found. The birds sampled in this research were from a breeding institution without any vaccination program; thus, the virus found did not develop from any attempted vaccination program to said captive birds. The birds sampled appeared to be healthy, but it is unknown whether the isolated virus can cause infection in chickens. The birds were also born and bred in the same institution, so the path of infection is unknown. Further research on biosecurity, including factors such as water quality or the possibility of contact with wild birds, is needed to identify the origin of infection.",

            "text": "Evidence of infections by the IBV vaccine virus or the infectious IBV strain to birds of other species has been reported before. Reverse spillover of the vaccine virus from domesticated birds to wild birds has been proposed by Devlin et al. [5] and Rohaim et al. [26]. Our results were similar to the previous study by Ito et al. [18], which discovered that IB-like coronavirus from peafowl has close genetic relatedness with the IBV H120 vaccine strain. This previous study also showed that the vaccine strain may infect non-chicken birds and may have few mutations that, upon infection to chickens, do not inflict disease. Liu et al. [21] have also suggested that not only the vaccine strains but also a possible infectious IBV strain may be transmitted from poultry to birds of other species. For example, cross-transmission of nephropathogenic IBV virus occurred in teal housed near domesticated poultry [21]. This means that IBV can infect a variety of bird species. In a possible case where infected birds are wild birds, these birds may act as a reservoir of the virus and spread it to other susceptible species [27]. Transmission of the virus to wild birds has likely happened due to poor biosecurity in poultry farms and contamination from improper disposal of litter and waste [5]. Most of the Indonesian poultry farmers still rely on an Open House Coop. A high density of birds without effective biosecurity and disease prevention increases the possibility of viral mutation [8]. Contamination from improper disposal of litter and waste may ease the transmission from domesticated poultry to wild birds. Spillover to wild birds is often overlooked, especially in terms of its ecological impact. This is especially important for endangered species. However, the epidemiology and effect of spillover from domesticated birds to wild birds are not yet fully understood, despite evidence of its occurrence.",

            "text": "Not only impacting wild birds but also this spillover effect is important for the poultry industry. Other RNA avian viruses with similarly high mutation rates such as avian influenza (AI) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) illustrate the importance of disease transmission between poultry and wild birds. The emergence and spread of highly pathogenic AI often contribute to its presence in wild birds [28,29]. In the case of AI, mutation and recombination possibly happened in wild birds and emerged as a highly pathogenic virus in poultry to a devastating effect. Its spread to various continents might also be attributed to migrating waterfowl carrying the virus [29]. Persistent outbreaks, despite a rigorous vaccination effort, such as what has happened in IBV, can be seen in NDV [30]. Studies on both free-living birds and poultry show how NDV has circulated and continued to evolve in the environment [30,31]. These cases, although they describe other viruses, illustrate the importance of biosecurity and surveillance to prevent possible emerging virulent viruses in the future through the transmission of disease between free-living birds and domestic birds. This is especially important for developing countries where many still practice backyard farming and small-scale farming with low biosecurity [28,31], such as those in Indonesia. Unfortunately, interspecies studies of IBV are rarely conducted in the country. This study is the first to have studied IBV in a species of bird other than chicken in Indonesia.",
