Although TB can affect multiple organs, it primarily involves the respiratory system. Highly contagious active pulmonary TB (aPTB) commonly presents with vague clinical symptoms such as fever, weight loss, chronic productive cough, and occasional dyspnea and hemoptysis1. These signs can be mistaken for community-acquired pneumonia and can be missed on the initial diagnosis in the emergency department, thereby increasing the risk of nosocomial infection and additional transmission of the disease to the general population2.",

            "text": "The acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear of respiratory sputum is used for the rapid diagnosis of aPTB; however, this test is noted to have poor sensitivity (between 30% and 70%)3. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)4 recommends that nucleic acid amplification (NAA), including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), should be performed on at least one respiratory specimen from each patient with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered but has not yet been established5. However, the sensitivity of PCR is variable (ie, 74% to 85%) and the sensitivity for smear-negative (SN) is poor (e.g. 53% to 73%)6. Routine implementation of PCR on all first specimens submitted for mycobacterial culture without consideration of the clinical history is impractical and costly4. Results of PCR may be available within 1 day after taking a respiratory specimen; however, the rapid PCR-based assessment is dependent upon the ability to obtain a respiratory specimen. Therefore, if the initial sputum is negative (iSN), more than one day may be needed to obtain another sample and subsequent smear-positive (SP) sputum using PCR. Patients and/or family members may refuse or hesitate to receive the bronchoscopy procedure; thus, specimens cannot be obtained this way. Recent reports suggest that high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) may be a useful tool for identifying PTB and pneumonia7,8, and may be performed before bronchoscopy, especially in patients with iSN9. If bronchoscopy cannot be performed or patients have a tendency to bleed, HRCT can be used to classify the most infectious patients (PTB) and the patients can be isolated. HRCT plays an important role in the identification of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). In addition, bronchoscopy is also limited by the necessity of waiting for the results of cultures, particularly when the smear- from bronchoscopy specimens is (\u2212, \u2212, \u2212).",

The present study was designed to identify independent disease-related variables associated with symptoms/signs, CXR and HRCT of [iSN-aPTB] and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of models that incorporated these variables in diagnosis [iSN-aPTB] in patients with early stage ALI.

Furthermore, the highly predictive negative values were found in the [CXR + Hypoalbuminemia] (93.0%; in validation cohort) and the HRCT (99.5%; in validation cohort) model. Therefore, using these two models, it was possible to identify patients with [non-aPTB-PD] among [iSN-PD] patients with scores <2 (305/328) in the [CXR + Hypoalbuminemia] model and scores <3 (339/341) in the HRCT model.",

First, our analysis was limited to the variables we evaluated using the [CXR + Hypoalbuminemia] and HRCT models. It is possible that other clinical variables may also be predictive of [iSN-aPTB]. In addition, our patient population was drawn from a limited geographical region and it is not known how our findings may translate to other regions. Additional studies are required from other countries and populations to further validate our models. In order for patients to receive HRCT after invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5 in derivation cohort, n = 6 in validation cohort), it is necessary for a physician to be on call/available. Usually, in Taiwan hospitals, the emergency room (ER) is close to the CT room so the transport time is within 10 minutes for nearly all patients30. The ER is staffed by experienced emergency doctors who are on duty 24 hours a day. Meanwhile, a large portion of patients in the derivation (254/259) and validation (366/372) cohorts received HRCT at ER without invasive mechanical ventilation.Only (5/259) and (6/372) received HRCT after the invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU. If the patients receive invasive mechanical ventilation after being sedated, the use of sedative drugs may be associated with aspiration pneumonia, shock, or hypoxemia31. However, if HRCT is performed as early as possible as in this study, unexpected adverse reactions may be avoided. Mortality was only rarely found in the transport process of patients with early ALI in previous reports18,32,33. No mortality was found in the transport process among these patients in the present study.",

Thus, this simple model may avoid overuse of the isolation room. Finally, owing to the high likelihood ratio (for derivation cohort, 71), the post-test probability in the lower prevalence (1%) is 41.5%. Therefore, this model may be useful in this area34 and may be an alternative choice or have an auxiliary role with bronchoscopy among the iSN patients, especially when the sputum-smear status is (\u2212, \u2212, \u2212). Consequently, there is still a need to wait for culture results if a sputum-smear status is (\u2212, \u2212, \u2212) although additional studies are needed to further address this issue.",
