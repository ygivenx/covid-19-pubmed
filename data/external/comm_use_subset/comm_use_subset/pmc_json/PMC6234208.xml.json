            "text": "The H7N9 influenza virus was first isolated in southeastern China in early 20131. Since then, five epidemic waves have been reported that have caused 1258 human infections, with ~40% resulting in death2. H7N9 causes severe respiratory distress syndrome in patients and is frequently associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumonia3. Noticeable dysbiosis of the oropharyngeal microbiome in H7N9 patients has also been observed4. During the fifth epidemic alone, 688 human infections were confirmed, making it the largest H7N9 epidemic to date. Although no sustained human-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus was confirmed, limited human-to-human transmission has been observed2. Because H7N9 viruses are able to be transmitted by the airborne route between ferrets5 and can infect and replicate in the human lower airways6, they have the potential for efficient human-to-human transmission and are an increasing pandemic threat. Furthermore, unlike H5N1, a high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus that causes severe disease in birds and poultry, most of the currently isolated H7N9 viruses are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses that typically elicit no observable signs of disease in birds after viral infection. Early warning and disease control for an H7N9 pandemic may be extremely difficult, although HPAI H7N9 viruses that are more pathogenic in birds and mammals have recently emerged7\u20139. H7N9 cases have spread to 22 provinces and municipalities in mainland China2. Due to its ability to more readily be transmitted from birds to humans, avian-origin H7N9 has raised concerns regarding its potential for increasing the possibility of a pandemic. Thus, it is prudent to conduct clinical trials to identify an effective treatment against H7N9 influenza.",

            "text": "As a typical member of influenza A viruses, H7N9 is classified into subtypes based on the two major surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), which are responsible for viral recognition, attachment to the cellular receptor and viral release. HA and NA are ideal targets for antiviral drug design. NA inhibitors, including oseltamivir and zanamivir, are currently the primary therapeutic treatment against H7N9 infection in clinical settings10,11. However, because of the emergence of escape mutants that are resistant to oseltamivir or zanamivir or even both10,11, alternative treatment options for human H7N9 infection are urgently needed. Vaccination is the most effective intervention against seasonal influenza. It has been demonstrated that the H7N9 vaccine is able to induce the production of both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies in humans12, and an inactivated H7N9 vaccine has entered clinical trials13. It was very interesting and encouraging to discover that some nonneutralizing antibodies could also protect mice from H7N9 infection through Fc\u2013FcgR interactions12. Vaccination with seasonal H3N2 strains was also shown to elicit H7 cross-reactive antibodies, although the level of serum protection in the general population remains to be determined14. However, in the event of a pandemic outbreak, massive vaccinations against an emerging virus cannot promptly achieve herd immunity. Limited by antiviral drug resistance, neutralizing therapeutic antibodies are considered to be a potentially effective treatment for influenza infections. Passive immunotherapy using convalescent plasma from patients to treat H5N1 and H1N1 infections has achieved encouraging results and has reduced mortality15\u201317. However, the large-scale production of antiserum is not possible in response to an emergency epidemic. The production of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) would provide a feasible solution to this problem. Recent studies have characterized several neutralizing antibodies from human donors that target different epitopes on viral HA proteins, such as CT14918, H7.16719, m82620, HNIgGD521, and HNIgGA622, all of which represent potential interventions in the event of an H7N9 pandemic.",

In this study, we determined the breadth of the effectiveness of HNIgGA6 against divergent H7N9 strains isolated from March 2013 to January 2017, as well as against three HPAI H7N9 variants. A series of representative viral isolates were tested in pseudovirus-based neutralization assays. We report that HNIgGA6 can neutralize the most prevalent H7N9 strains.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the results confirmed that all the human H7s descended from the same ancestor. Most of the HAs from 2013 to 2014 were very similar and formed a cluster. However, after the initial outbreak, a broad dissemination of the virus was observed that indicated the occurrence of more frequent amino acid changes in HA. Previously, we reported that an H7N9-neutralizing antibody, HNIgGA6, recognized the viral receptor binding site (RBS) on HA123. To evaluate potential antigenic drift, we performed an alignment of 12 randomly selected HA1 sequences and assessed the amino acid substitutions in the viral RBS.

All the mutants were confirmed, and as shown in Fig. 3a, all five mutants retained the ability to bind HNIgGA6. Nevertheless, the V186G or L226Q mutations led to a noticeably reduced affinity. Dual mutations at V186G and L226Q resulted in complete loss of binding to the mAb (Fig. 3b). In contrast, when 186G and 226Q in H7N9-SH1 were reversely mutated to V186 and L226, the mutants were restored in their ability to bind HNIgGA6 (Fig. 3c). These findings were further confirmed with full-length viral HA by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) detection. As expected, the HA of H7N9-AH but not H7N9-SH1 was recognized by HNIgGA6 (Fig. 3d).

In this study, to avoid the lethal pathogenicity of the live H7N9 virus, we took advantage of a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay to evaluate the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6. Pseudoviruses expressing the NA of H7N9-AH and divergent HAs were produced in 293T cells, and the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 was tested on susceptible MDCK cells. As in the neutralization assay with live H7N9-AH viruses, HNIgGA6 neutralized the H7N9-AH pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 41.66 ng/ml (Fig. 4a). The neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 against divergent H7N9 strains was also tested. As expected, although the H7N9-SH1 strain was resistant to HNIgGA6, the antibody could neutralize the other 11 strains with estimated IC50 values from 36.53 to 63.47 ng/ml (Fig. 4b). The V186G and L226Q mutations led to antigenic drift for viral HA1 and the full-length HA protein, and the ability of the mutations to confer resistance against the mAb was also determined using pseudovirus entry assay. As shown in Fig. 4c, when V186G and L226Q were present in H7N9-AH, the pseudovirus successfully escaped from HNIgGA6 pressure. In contrast, when G186 and Q226 were replaced by V186 and L226, the mutated H7N9-SH1 was neutralized the mAb. Taken together, these results confirmed that V186G and L226Q were responsible for antigenic drift in H7N9-SH1.",

Because it is present on the surface of the influenza virion, the HA glycoprotein is the primary target for developing neutralizing antibodies. However, the high variability of viral HA makes it difficult to develop a highly cross-reactive neutralizing antibody. This is especially true since viral HA is able to continually evolve while maintaining surface sialic acid receptor binding capability, which leads to escape from the antibody response and is known as antigenic drift37,38.",

            "text": "Although different HAs display unique structural features, the sialic acid-binding pocket on the HA RBS is highly conserved for the recognition of the common receptor. A few RBS-directed antibodies have successfully achieved modest cross-reactivity36,39,40 by interposing a smaller footprint into the receptor binding groove. However, most RBS-directed antibodies have exhibited a limited breadth in their neutralization activity, including 2D141 and 5J842, due to extra contacts with variable residues in the periphery of the conserved pocket. In this study, we tested the binding affinity of HNIgGA6 for 12 different HAs of prevalent H7N9 strains isolated from April 2013 to January 2017. H7N9 HA has been rapidly evolving (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with the previous result that H7 HA is continually mutating at a high rate43. Our results showed that HNIgGA6 utilizes avidity to extend its breadth of recognition and to increase its affinity against a large portion of divergent HA strains (11 out of 12), including the A143V/R148K variant, which has become the dominant circulating strain in the fifth wave43. HNIgGA6 exhibited a loss of binding to the HA variant on the H7N9-SH1 strain, an earlier isolate from the 2013 Shanghai epidemic carrying an avian H7 signature1. The preference for avian \u03b1\u22122,3-linked sialic acid cellular receptors rather than human \u03b1\u22122,6-linked sialic acids receptors limited its transmission to humans, and the SH1 strain was rarely observed in latter outbreaks. Two amino acids substitutions (V186G and L226Q) were responsible for the preference of different cellular receptors, as well as the antigenic drift of H7N9-SH1 (Fig. 3). Although HNIgGA6 recognized 11 other HAs, the observed binding affinities were not completely consistent. An approximately tenfold decrease in binding affinity was observed for A/Hebei/01/2013 and A/Guangdong/15SF001/2015 carrying the L226Q and V186A mutations, respectively, indicating important roles of V186 and L226 in binding HNIgGA6. The reason for the attenuated binding affinity to A/Jiangsu/06306/2014, A/Fujian/1/2016, A/Anhui/13433/2017, and A/Zhejiang/5/2017 remains to be determined. However, the A135V substitution in the RBS that the four strains share in common is surely worth studying further.",

However, because the pseudotyped virus particle entry assays may be overly sensitive, an accurate assessment of the in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 using live H7N9 viruses is still needed. This is especially necessary since mutations on other genes besides HA are also associated with viral replication capacity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility. The E627K mutation in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene enhances H7N9 replication in mammals44. The K526R mutation in PB2, which was identified in a HPAI H7N9 (A/Taiwan/1/2017) strain, also contributes to improve replication efficiency together with 627K45. The NA R292K mutation confers resistance to both oseltamivir and peramivir46. Nevertheless, based on genetic and phylogenetic analyses, the WHO has recommended that H7N9-AH may serve as a viable vaccine candidate for broad protection against H747,48.

In the absence of an effective vaccine, direct administration of H7N9-neutralizing antibodies could be used as an intervention to prevent H7N9 infections in humans. This approach could be especially helpful for those at high risk for contracting H7N9. When administered prophylactically, HNIgGA6 conferred 100% protection in virus-infected mice22, supporting this rationale. Alternatively, the RBS-directed neutralizing antibody HNIgGA6 can be used together with other antiviral drugs (e.g., oseltamivir and zanamivir) to control the production of the escape mutants that limit the effectiveness of these NA inhibitors10,11.",
