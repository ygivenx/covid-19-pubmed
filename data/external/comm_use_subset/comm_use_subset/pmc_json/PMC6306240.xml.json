O. volvulus infection is commonly diagnosed through the presence of microfilariae in skin snips, but skin samples can be further analyzed by qPCR for enhanced sensitivity [2]. Antibody tests (e.g. Ov16 [3,4]) are available but do not have the ability to differentiate between past and present infections which is problematic in areas where the infection is endemic [5]. Recently, a limited number of biomarkers have been identified in the urine that can distinguish between O. volvulus-infected and non-infected individuals [6\u20138].",

The only susceptible animal hosts for O. volvulus are chimpanzees [9,10] and mangabey monkeys [11]. Chimpanzees infected with O. volvulus had patent infections that lasted between 6 to 9 years with adult-worm bundles located in deep tissues with microfilariae in skin snips being detected 12\u201318 months post infection [12,13]. While immunologically intact mice are resistant to infection with the infective larvae (L3) of O. volvulus [14], adult worms within nodules have been successfully transplanted into SCID mice (NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J) with the worms surviving greater than 20 weeks [15]. This observation was confirmed by the successful transplantation of adult Onchocerca ochengi into SCID mice [16]. As an alternative approach, O. volvulus L3 were implanted in primates and rodents within diffusion chambers that consist of a Lucite ring enclosed with permeable membranes, allowing for migration of cells and other humoral factors into the diffusion chamber with simultaneous containment of the parasites. O. volvulus in diffusion chambers implanted in multiple species of rodents and primates showed limited growth of larvae in all host species [17].",

Based on the hypothesis that there is a genetic basis for mouse susceptibility and resistance to infection, novel strains of CC mice have been identified that are susceptible to specific bacteria, viruses, and parasites of humans [18\u201323].",

SCID mice were shown to be susceptible to infection with Brugia malayi while immunocompetent mice were resistant to the infection [24]. NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice are a highly immune-compromised strain of mice that have profound defects in the adaptive and innate immune responses [25]. The most notable defects include those in: 1) macrophages, dendritic cells and in the complement cascade [26\u201328]; 2) maturation of T and B cells [29]; 3) NK cells; 4) signaling of 6 different cytokines [30] and 5) the presence of eosinophils in the peripheral circulation and in tissue [31]. NOD-Rag1tm1Mom\nIL2rgtm1Wjl mice (NRG) are phenotypically similar to NSG mice with disruption in the B and T-Cell production [32]. Interestingly, NSG mice can support the complete lifecycle of the human nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, whereas immunologically intact mice cannot [31].",

In addition, biomarkers to assess the infection status of treated individuals or macrofilaricidal activity are sorely lacking [6\u20138]. One of the critical barriers blocking drug and biomarker development has been the absence of suitable small animal hosts for experimentation. Hence, this study was focused on the development of a small animal model that would support the growth and maturation of O. volvulus and could serve to identify parasite specific biomarkers. To this end we tested multiple genetically defined mouse strains and xenografted (with human cells) immunodeficient mice to identify those microenvironments suitable for O. volvulus development. In so doing, we were able to develop convenient and tractable murine models that support the development of O. volvulus L3 into advanced larval stages. Moreover, we were able to use these O. volvulus-infected animals to identify parasite-derived biomarkers measurable in both urine and serum.",

Mobile phase B was 99.5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid. The 240 min LC gradient ran from 0% B to 35% B over 210 min, then to 80% B for the remaining 30 min. Samples were loaded directly to the column. The column was 50 cm x 75 um I.D. and packed with 2 \u03bcm C18 media (Thermo Easy Spray PepMap). The LC was interfaced to a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) via nano-electrospray ionization using a source with an integrated column heater (Thermo Easy Spray, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The column was heated to 50\u00b0C. An electrospray voltage of 2.2 kV was applied. The mass spectrometer was programmed to acquire, by data-dependent acquisition, tandem mass spectra from the top 10 ions in the full scan from 400\u20131200 m/z. Dynamic exclusion was set to 15 s, singly-charged ions were excluded, isolation width was set to 1.6 Da, full MS resolution to 70,000 and MS/MS resolution to 17,500. Normalized collision energy was set to 25, automatic gain control to 2e5, max fill MS to 20 ms, max fill MS/MS to 60 ms and the underfill ratio to 0.1%.",

Briefly, all searches required 10 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.02 Da fragment mass tolerance, strict tryptic cleavage, up to 2 missed cleavages, fixed modification of cysteine alkylation, variable modification of methionine oxidation and protein-level expectation value scores of 0.0001 or lower. Proteome Cluster builds species- and genus-specific protein sequence libraries from the most current UniProtKB distribution [53]. MGF files were searched using the most recent protein sequence libraries available from UniProtKB using X!Tandem [54] and OMSSA [55]. XML output files were parsed and non-redundant protein sets determined using Proteome Cluster based on previously published rules [56]. MS1-based isotopoic features were detected and peptide peak areas were calculated using the FeatureFinderCentroid tool, part of the OpenMS framework [52]. Proteins were required to have 1 or more unique peptides across the analyzed samples with E-value scores of 0.0001 or less.",

Human cells were selected for study based on the anatomical niche they typically inhabit that would parallel the niches of O. volvulus in humans. Luciferin labeled HuSkMc cells injected into NSG mice had a life span of approximately one week based on in vivo imaging. Thus, NSG mice received weekly injections of BESM, LEC, HaCaT, or HuSkMc cells. Mice were injected with 100 O. volvulus L3 immediately after the cell inoculations. At 4-weeks post-inoculation of the L3, 60% of BESM cell engrafted mice established O. volvulus infection with a GM recovery of 1 worm per mouse with a maximum of 1 worm/mouse recovered (S1 Table). Mice engrafted with LEC had 20% established infection and GM of 4 worms recovered per mouse with a range of 1 to 4 worms per mouse (S1 Table). HaCaT cell engrafted mice had a 60% established infection and GM recovery 1.7 worms recovered per mouse with between 1 and 2 worms per mouse (S1 Table). HuSkMc cell engrafted mice had an 81% established O. volvulus infection rate at 4-weeks post-infection and GM recovery 2.4 worms recovered per mouse with between 1 and 8 per mouse. Based on the enhanced survival of O. volvulus in mice engrafted with HuSkMc cells, extended infections were evaluated. At 8-weeks post-infection, mice with HuSkMc cells had a 58% established infection rate with a GM parasite recovery of 1.4 with a range of 1 to 3 per mouse. At 12-weeks post-infection, 80% of the mice had established infections at recovery with a GM parasite recovery of 1.6 with 1 to 3 per mouse (Fig 1B). At each time point tested the parasites in HuSkMc-engrafted mice demonstrated continued parasite growth. At 4-weeks recovered parasites had GM lengths of 713 \u03bcm (Min: 592 \u03bcm, Max: 788 \u03bcm), at 8-weeks lengths of 751 \u03bcm (Min: 642 \u03bcm, Max: 1,081 \u03bcm), and at 12-weeks the GM length was 1,121 \u03bcm with a maximum length of 2,086 \u03bcm observed (Min: 748 \u03bcm), representing a 4-fold increase in length over L3 (Fig 2).

A total of 7,430 proteins were identified based on the spectral matching to a combined protein database of human, mouse, O. volvulus and its Wolbachia (wOv) endosymbiont. Because of the ambiguity in distinguishing certain spectral matches for proteins commonly found in both humans and mice, these proteins were grouped as non-O. volvulus proteins (4,743 in serum, 2,836 in urine, S1 Fig). The present study, however, focused on only O. volvulus derived proteins as potential parasite-encoded biomarkers of O. volvulus infection. Of all the proteins identified, 155 O. volvulus proteins (111 in serum and 44 in the urine) were detected in the infected mice and not in the control mice. While there were no proteins that were commonly detected in the serum and urine of the infected mice, the BLT and HuSkMc mice had 5 proteins (OVOC11556, OVOC835, OVOC10244, OVOC4009 and OVOC9087) in common in the serum and 5 (OVOC7220, OVOC4139, OVOC224, OVOC8249 and OVOC9267) in the urine (Fig 4B). Almost all the proteins identified have been shown through RNAseq to be transcribed by various stages of the O. volvulus parasite (Fig 4B).",

These small animal models are critically needed for identifying biomarkers released from the early stages of the infection and for screening potential new anthelmintics. Published findings on the susceptibility of mice to infection with the L3 of O. volvulus suggest that mice are resistant to infection when the larvae were injected subcutaneously [14]. However, O. volvulus L3 have been shown to survive and develop in mice when implanted within diffusion chambers at rates comparable to those seen in susceptible primates [17].",

The CC mouse project was developed to produce an extremely diverse set of inbred animals that could be used for mapping different genetic traits [57]. Five different CC mouse strains, selected based on their diverse genetic backgrounds, were tested for susceptibility to O. volvulus and were completely resistant to the infection. This observation suggests that either mice are missing some integral factors required for parasite growth or the immune responses in mice are effective at eliminating the infection. The question remains as to why parasites are recovered live from diffusion chambers implanted in mice but not when injected into the tissues. There are several possible explanations including: (1) the diffusion chamber acts as a barrier from the immune response creating an immune privileged site, (2) the larvae within the diffusion chamber are blocked from migrating through the tissue releasing excretory and secretory products and thereby eliciting an immune reaction, or (3) the diffusion chamber attracts host components to the parasite microenvironment that are beneficial for parasite development.",

These findings demonstrate that the mouse immune response was capable of controlling infection with O. volvulus, with elements of the mouse immune response eliminating the infection in immunologically intact mice. Many mechanisms have been described for innate immune control of nematode infections in mice [39,60\u201367] all or some of which may be effective against O. volvulus.

Four different single cell xenografts were screened: HuSkMc, LEC, HaCaT and BESM.

NSG, NSG-SGM, and NRG mice, all of which lack functional immune responses, were humanized with CD34+ umbilical cord stem cells. The humanization of the various immunocompromised mouse strains resulted in the development of an immature human immune system. The developing immune system in these mice displays a T-independent response, limited antigen-specific IgM responses, and the presence of multiple innate immune cells has been noted [25]. When humanized NSG, NSG-SGM, and NRG mice were infected with O. volvulus L3, higher GM parasite recoveries were observed when compared to NSG mice without any human cells but these enhancements were not significant. Although NSG-SGM did have consistent infection rates with O. volvulus we had significant difficulties establishing reliable engraftment of human cells in this strain of mice. Extending this concept further, BLT mice which contain CD34+ stem cells in addition to fetal tissue were used. BLT mice are known to develop a more mature version of a human immune system. Limited T-dependent recognition is seen within these mice and better overall functionality of both the B and T-cells has been documented [36]. BLT mice supported the highest average parasite recoveries of any mouse model tested at 4-weeks, although the average fell to be in line with the HuNSG and HuSkMc models by 8-weeks post infection. The mean lengths of the parasites recovered from 4- and 8-week time points from the NSG mice were comparable to those recovered from BLT mice. This suggests a link between the enhanced survival, may be related to the presence of the human immune cells, but the growth of the parasites that survive may not be related to the human cell byproducts. Although cellular engraftments levels in BLT and HuNSG mice were not rechecked at the end of the experiment previously published data have shown that these animals reliably hold their engraftments for extended periods of time [72,73].",

While non-human primates can support the development of the parasites from L3 to microfilariae producing adults, cost and ethical considerations limit the utility of primates for drug discovery and antigen identification [10,14]. Nodules containing adult worms recovered from humans have been implanted into SCID mice and the female worms survived and released microfilariae [15]. This method allows for identification of adult antigens and biomarkers, but lacks the intermediate L3 and L4 stages of development. Finally, an alternative model using adult male O. ochengi implanted into SCID mice has been developed for the identifying filaricides [16], which may also be effective against O. volvulus. The NSG models developed in this study have the critical advantage of working with O. volvulus, thereby allowing species-specific screening of filaricides and identification of biomarkers.",

It is reasonable to predict that a percentage of larvae exiting from the mouth parts of a black fly have the potential to resume development in the human host and that the cryopreservation process damaged some of those worms. Approximately 50 percent of the larvae recovered after cryopreservation survived in diffusion chambers implanted in mice, which may explain the overall number of worms recovered from the different mouse models in this study. While minor differences in the overall larval recovery levels were observed between individual batches of cryopreserved larvae, multiple batches were combined before implantation to help ensure a consistent viability level going into the animal hosts. Even with the combination of multiple batches of larvae it cannot be ruled out that the overall viability of the injected larvae played a role in the observed recovery rates. The recovery rates of O. volvulus larvae after developing in NSG mice with or without human cells was in the same order of magnitude as that reported for the recovery of adult filarial worms, where infections were initiated by larvae recovered directly from the insect vector. These infections included Brugia pahangi in cats [74], Brugia malayi in leaf-monkey [75], and Onchocerca ochengi in cattle [76].

Growth of worms within a single mouse was not consistent and suggests that there is significant variability within the infecting larval population. It does verify, however, that humanized mice have the potential to support extended development of O. volvulus. Both male and female worms grew in length and resumed their sexual development. Although no cast cuticles were observed, it was evident from organ development that the parasites had molted into fourth-stage larvae.",

Several O. volvulus-specific peptides were identified in the serum and urine of BLT and HuSkMc mice (S3 Table), however, no O. volvulus-specific proteins were found in both urine and serum from either mouse source. The most likely useful biomarkers were the proteins listed in Fig 4B. Though most of the proteins were identified by one or more unique peptide(s), among the proteins with unknown function (OVOC9087, OVOC835, OVOC224), OVOC9087 does not have orthologues in other filarial species and hence would likely be able to distinguish O. volvulus from other filarial infections. Because of the expected low number and abundance of O. volvulus-specific protein identification in the serum and urine from any given mouse in the current system, mass spectrometry was carried out with pooled serum and urine samples from each group of mice.",
