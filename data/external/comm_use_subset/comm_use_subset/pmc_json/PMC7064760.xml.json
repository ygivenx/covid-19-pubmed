EJC-dependent NMD occurs when a ribosome terminates at a PTC with a downstream EJC (a hallmark of incorrect splicing). UPF2 and UPF3 are recruited to UPF1 via the EJC, leading to phosphorylation of UPF1 by SMG1 (2) and triggering endonucleolytic or exonucleolytic cleavage, depending on the eukaryotic system (5, 6). In plants, degradation of NMD-targeted transcripts can take place in subcellular processing bodies (P-bodies), where the UPF1-RNA complex is recruited by SMG7 (6). P-bodies are enriched in NMD factors (7) and have previously been shown to accumulate aberrant mRNAs in yeast (8).",

            "text": "Evidence is emerging that indicates that viruses predisposed to NMD targeting have evolved different strategies to circumvent NMD that include both cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting proteins (18, 19). For example, a pyrimidine-rich, 400-nt sequence immediately following the gag stop codon in Rous sarcoma virus confers NMD resistance to the unspliced viral RNA by recruiting polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which prevents UPF1 from binding (20, 21). In contrast, Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) contains an \u223c50-nt unstructured region (USR) at the start of its 3\u2032 UTR that can confer NMD resistance to sensitive transcripts (22). Introducing stable secondary structure into the TCV USR without changing its sequence abolished NMD protection, whereas significantly changing the sequence while maintaining the lack of structure maintained protection, suggesting that highly unpaired regions of RNA are inherently NMD resistant when positioned immediately downstream of a termination codon (22). Ribosome recoding (frameshifting and readthrough) sites, which allow translation to continue past termination codons, can also protect NMD-sensitive RNAs (22\u201324). These infrequent recoding events are proposed to prevent NMD when the continuing ribosome displaces UPF1.",

HTLV-1 Tax expression also alters the morphology of P-bodies, representing a major site of NMD decay (26). In addition, the HTLV-1 Rex protein, which promotes nuclear export of unspliced and singly spliced viral RNAs, protects NMD-sensitive viral and host mRNAs by disrupting NMD through an unknown mechanism (27). ZIKV capsid protein targets nuclear UPF1 for proteasomal degradation, causing a global inhibition of NMD (28). The viral core protein of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disrupts the interaction between host protein WIBG and EJC components, attenuating NMD (29). Finally, the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) transactivator (TAV) protein interferes with the VARICOSE decapping complex, which is likely required late in the plant NMD pathway (30).",

However, gRNAs can be stabilized by plant virus-encoded movement proteins (MPs), which bind to viral and other RNAs without known specificity and traffic them in a cell-to-cell manner through plasmodesmata and/or over long distances through the vascular system (31, 32). Umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) (family Tombusviridae) has a positive-sense, single-stranded gRNA (4.2 kb) that is targeted by NMD (22) and that encodes both cell-to-cell and long-distance MPs (p27 and p26, respectively) (Fig. 1A). The best-studied umbravirus MP is the p26 orthologue from Groundnut rosette virus (GRV) known as plasmid ORF3 (pORF3). pORF3 localizes to the nucleolus and interacts with nuclear protein fibrillarin for long-distance (systemic) movement of GRV gRNA (32\u201335). pORF3 also binds nucleic acids nonspecifically (31), and both pORF3 and PEMV2 p26 were previously shown to be able to increase the stability of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) gRNA (36). The stabilization activity of pORF3 was posited to result from formation of dense ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles consisting of pORF3 oligomers, fibrillarin, and viral RNA (31, 34, 35).",

Elimination of p27 expression had no effect on virus accumulation in Arabidopsis protoplasts in a previous study (38). In contrast, mutating the p26 start codon (PEMV2\u0394p26) resulted in a 4-fold decrease in viral RNA levels, suggesting that the p26 long-distance MP has an additional function that enhances accumulation of PEMV2 gRNA in single cells (38). To determine if similar effects would be apparent in planta, wild-type (WT) PEMV2 or PEMV2\u0394p26 was subjected to agroinfiltration along with the p14 RNA silencing suppressor from Pothos latent virus (PLV) (39) into leaves of young Nicotiana benthamiana plants, which are widely used as laboratory hosts for a large number of plant viruses. p14 was included for all agroinfiltrations to increase transient gene expression and also to serve as an internal control for reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Since agroinfiltration leads to expression of viral gRNA in nearly every cell within the infiltrated region, assaying gRNA accumulation in infiltrated (local) leaves reflects the efficiency of virus replication/stability independently of virus movement. At 3 days postinfiltration (dpi), PEMV2\u0394p26 gRNA accumulation in local leaves (i.e., infiltrated leaves) was reduced 4-fold compared with WT PEMV2 (Fig. 1B), similarly to what was previously observed using Arabidopsis protoplasts (38) and further supporting the idea of a role for p26 in promoting genome stability independently of long-distance movement.",

When additional GFP is overexpressed by agroinfiltration of plasmid PZP-GFP, both endogenous and infiltrated GFP levels are silenced, substantially reducing GFP fluorescence (40). However, when an RNA silencing suppressor is infiltrated, a patch of strong GFP fluorescence is observed, as the GFP mRNA is no longer silenced. Indeed, coinfiltration of PZP-GFP with the p19 RNA silencing suppressor from Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (41) reversed the silencing and resulted in strong GFP expression (Fig. 1C). However, coinfiltration of PZP-GFP with p26 or PEMV2 replicase-associated protein p33 had no effect on GFP silencing, demonstrating that both p26 and p33 were shown to lack detectable RNA silencing suppressor activity by this assay. Although PEMV2 lacks an RNA silencing suppressor, Pea enation mosaic virus 1, an enamovirus and helper virus for PEMV2, possesses an RNA silencing suppressor that likely confers protection to the PEMV2 genome during natural coinfections (42).",

Percentages of translational efficiencies (TE%) were determined by dividing the mean GFP intensities by the mean relative mRNA accumulation under each condition. In the presence of p26, GFP-3\u2032UTRPEMV and GFP-L had TE% values of 48% and 54%, respectively, while the presence of U1D had only a minor effect (Fig. 2B). Importantly, p26 did not decrease the TE% of NMD-resistant GFP-S transcripts, demonstrating that in vivo, p26 represses translation only of NMD targets with long 3\u2032 UTRs and does not cause global translation inhibition (Fig. 2B). To determine if p26 directly inhibits translation in an in vitro assay, C-terminal histidine-tagged p26 (p26-His6) was preincubated (10:1 molar ratio) with transcripts from a previously described luciferase reporter construct (5\u203289 + 3U; contains the PEMV2 5\u2032 89 nt and 3\u2032 UTR) (43), and translation was assayed for in wheat germ extracts (WGE). p26-His6 reduced translation of 5\u203289 + 3U by over 4-fold compared to buffer of otherwise identical composition (see Text S1 and Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). p26 also reduced translation of a polyadenylated control RNA that lacks a 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. S1A), indicating that translation inhibition is not restricted to transcripts with PEMV2 sequences. Similar observations have been made for cellular RNA-binding proteins that render transcripts inaccessible to the translation machinery or interfere with translating ribosomes (44). Interestingly, p26 inhibited translation of both the NMD-resistant and NMD-sensitive reporters in vitro, but only the NMD-sensitive transcripts bearing long 3\u2032 UTRs were translationally repressed in vivo (Fig. 2B).",

In the presence of U1D, HA-p26 increased GFP-3\u2032UTRPEMV mRNA levels by 70% (versus 300% with active NMD), suggesting that p26-mediated protection is mainly but not exclusively associated with NMD (Fig. 2C). Alternatively, it remains possible that the 70% increase in GFP-3\u2032UTRPEMV mRNA levels seen with HA-p26 expression is attributable to incomplete NMD inhibition by U1D. While HA-p26 increased mRNA levels by 70%, translation of GFP was not significantly increased (Fig. 2D), supporting the proposal that p26 was reducing the translational efficiency of NMD-sensitive transcripts.",

To determine if nucleolar localization of p26 is required for protection of NMD-sensitive transcripts, 6 arginines that are necessary for nucleolar localization of pORF3 (45) and conserved in p26 (Fig. S2) were mutated to asparagine, generating \u201cRN\u201d-designated mutants (Fig. 3A). WT p26 and p26-RN were C-terminally fused with GFP and inserted in place of the capsid protein ORF in a TMV expression vector that generates TMV gRNA that is incapable of systemic movement (46). TMV expressing either p26-GFP or p26-RN-GFP was subjected to infiltration into N. benthamiana leaves, and local leaves were imaged by fluorescence microscopy 5 to 7 days later. Both p26-GFP and p26-RN-GFP formed large cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in infected cells that were similar in size to those seen in DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-stained nuclei (Fig. 3B, left two panels). The vast majority of p26-GFP and p26-RN-GFP was observed in the cytoplasm, supporting the earlier report that in \u223c97% of cells, GRV pORF3-GFP was detected only in the cytoplasm (45). However, in \u223c1% of cells, p26-GFP localized to the nucleus, whereas p26-RN-GFP was always exclusively cytoplasmic/perinuclear (Fig. 3B, right). Coexpression of p26-GFP and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged DCP1 (a P-body marker) revealed that the p26 inclusion bodies were spatially separate from the P-bodies (Fig. 3C), which are considered to be major sites of NMD decay in plants (6, 7). Only p26-GFP was able to efficiently complement the defect in systemic movement of the TMV vector (Fig. S1B), confirming the previously reported detrimental effect of the pORF3 RN mutations on systemic movement of GRV (45).",

Approximately 10% of the unique transcripts detected in this study showed >1.8-fold increases in transcript abundance with U1D, which is similar to what was observed with NMD inhibition mediated by upf1 knockdown or knockout in multiple eukaryotic systems (48\u201352). Twenty percent of transcripts whose abundance increased >1.8-fold with NMD inhibition also showed >1.8-fold-increased abundance with HA-p26, and 34% of these NMD-sensitive transcripts showed >1.8-fold-increased abundance during PEMV2 infection (Fig. 4A). Arabidopsis NMD targets were previously found to be involved in diverse biological processes (50). Similarly, GO term enrichment analysis of transcripts upregulated >1.8-fold under all three sets of conditions resulted in few enriched processes but included macromolecule and protein modification as well as lipid and protein metabolism (Text S1 and Fig. S4; see also Data Set S2). Components of the NMD pathway whose transcripts are degraded by NMD as part of an autoregulatory system (SMG7, SMG9, UPF1, and UPF3) and EJC component CASC3 (53, 54) were selected for further RT-qPCR analysis. NMD inhibition (+U1D) and PEMV2 infection resulted in increased transcript levels for SMG7, SMG9, UPF1, UPF3, and CASC3, whereas HA-p26 expression increased transcript levels only for SMG7, SMG9, and UPF3 (Fig. 4B).

Plotting the log2 fold change (log2FC) values representing results of comparisons of transcript abundances between +PEMV2 and +U1D samples revealed a linear correlation (Fig. 4D). Among the transcripts whose expression decreased >1.8-fold with U1D expression, 72% showed significantly decreased expression during PEMV2 infection (Fig. 4E). In contrast, no linear correlation was observed in comparisons of expression profiles between +HA-p26 and either +U1D or +PEMV2 (Fig. S5A and B). The lack of any correlation between the expression profiles of +HA-p26 and +U1D suggests that the presence of p26 alone does not cause global NMD inhibition but instead protects a defined subset of NMD targets. Together, these findings demonstrate that PEMV2 infection disrupts the NMD pathway and causes off-target effects similar to those caused by a known NMD inhibitor.",

Despite the availability of only limited data from reporter assays showing a link between 3\u2032 UTR length and NMD sensitivity (Fig. 2B), examination of the entire transcriptome showed that the transcripts that were increasing in abundance in the presence of U1D did not have significantly longer 3\u2032 UTRs (Fig. 5A). Similar observations were made in previous transcriptome-wide analyses of NMD targets (5). Transcripts with increased abundance with HA-p26 expression had slightly longer 3\u2032 UTRs than downregulated transcripts (Fig. 5A). Both NMD targets (UP U1D) and transcripts protected by HA-p26 (UP p26) had 3\u2032 UTRs that showed significantly higher GC-rich levels than were seen with the downregulated genes (Down U1D and Down p26) (Fig. 5B). Transcripts with both GC-rich (>40%) and long 3\u2032 UTRs were preferentially upregulated by HA-p26, suggesting that the 3\u2032 UTR length is a determining factor for p26-mediated NMD resistance (Fig. 5C, top). Interestingly, this effect was not observed with U1D (Fig. 5C, bottom).

The only motif whose level was significantly enriched was a polypyrimidine hexamer among NMD-resistant transcripts (Fig. S6). This observation supports earlier work demonstrating that polypyrimidine tracts near a PTC can bind PTBP1 and confer NMD resistance (21).

            "text": "RNA viruses must protect their viral genomes from RNA degradation pathways for successful amplification. NMD is triggered by long 3\u2032 UTRs (>300-nt-long 3\u2032 UTRs in N. benthamiana [11]), making most plant RNA viruses susceptible to this degradation pathway. Despite a fundamental requirement to circumvent NMD, little is known about how plant RNA viruses protect their genomes. TCV and other carmoviruses contain a ribosome readthrough recoding element that likely protects their gRNA and a short (\u223c50-nt) unstructured region that protects their coat protein/silencing suppressor-encoding 1.45-kb sgRNA (22). The PEMV2 frameshift recoding site also likely confers some protection to the gRNA, and p26 binding to the region downstream of p94 may confer additional protection. During natural infections, enamovirus PEMV1 (GenBank accession no. NC_003629) RNA would be accessible to p26 and, as seen with PEMV2, translation termination after the PEMV1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ORF leaves a 1,896-nt 3\u2032 UTR. Therefore, p26 might be beneficial for PEMV1 during coinfections by protecting PEMV1 gRNAs from NMD. Unlike results observed previously for some carmoviruses (22), no cis-acting sequences protect the critical PEMV2 sgRNA, which encodes p26 and p27. We suggest that a novel form of protection of viral and host mRNAs against NMD is conferred by the trans-acting p26 long-distance MP on the basis of the following findings. (i) p26 expression alone protected NMD-sensitive transcripts from NMD (Fig. 2B). (ii) A significant number of NMD-susceptible host transcripts with long, GC-rich 3\u2032 UTRs increased in accumulation in the presence of p26 or PEMV2 (Fig. 4). In vivo, p26 repressed translation only of NMD-sensitive transcripts with long 3\u2032 UTRs (Fig. 2B) but repressed translation of all tested transcripts in vitro (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). A possible explanation is that under conditions of p26 preincubation with transcripts in the absence of any translation machinery in vitro, the entire transcript is accessible for binding. However, the NMD-resistant transcripts are actively translating in vivo and are mostly bound as polysomes, and the short 3\u2032 UTR may be insufficient for p26 association. A similar observation was previously reported regarding UPF1 binding (12), where long 3\u2032 UTRs were found to be heavily associated with UPF1 in vivo whereas short 3\u2032 UTRs were shown to be insufficient for UPF1 binding. Translational repression of transcripts with the PEMV2 3\u2032 UTR could also result from disruption of 3\u2032 cap-independent translation elements (CITEs) that are required for translation initiation by all Tombusviridae (59). Additional studies will be required to determine if the RNA secondary structures and/or functions of 3\u2032 CITEs are perturbed in the presence of p26.",

It remains unclear if p26 association with viral RNAs is reversible and whether viral RNAs in p26 inclusion bodies are replication competent (i.e., accessible to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other components necessary for replication). MPs from diverse plant viruses may also confer NMD resistance to viral and host transcripts in addition to virus trafficking. Plant virus MPs in general are nonspecific RNA-binding proteins and thus may also provide protection to noncognate RNAs. In addition, the dianthovirus Red clover necrotic mosaic virus contains a 35-kDa MP that forms RNase-resistant RNP complexes (60), which would likely also be immune to UPF1 surveillance.",

Due to the high degree of overlap of upregulated and downregulated transcripts during PEMV2 infection and U1D-mediated NMD inhibition (Fig. 4), we suggest that NMD inhibition is a major factor in driving the transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression observed during PEMV2 infection. Interestingly, genes involved in lipid metabolism were disproportionately upregulated upon NMD inhibition, p26 expression, or PEMV2 infection (Fig. S4). Tombusviruses have been shown to modulate lipid metabolism to promote the assembly of virus replicase complexes on peroxisome membranes (61\u201363). In the present study, transcripts encoding the class III peroxidase superfamily proteins PER4 and PER15 (64), as well as the critical peroxisome biogenesis protein PEX12 (65), were upregulated under all conditions (see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). These data suggest that NMD inhibition by PEMV2 could benefit virus replication by increasing peroxisome membrane biogenesis to support increasing amounts of virus replicase formation.",

In silencing-suppressed N. benthamiana, PEMV2 gRNA accumulates to rRNA levels (Fig. S3C) and the extraordinary amount of viral RNA in the late stages of an infection might also enhance NMD inhibition by serving as a sink for binding to and sequestering UPF1 and possibly additional NMD factors (Fig. 6, right). Considering the amount of PEMV2 RNA present during an established infection, endogenous UPF1 is unlikely to have any substantial effect on PEMV2 accumulation; however, NMD surveillance would be severely impaired due to a lack of free UPF1 (Fig. 6, right).",

However, evidence of viral proteins directly binding to viral (or nonviral) transcripts and conferring NMD resistance is limited. In contrast, several host proteins confer NMD resistance when bound immediately downstream of a NMD-sensitive stop codon. PABPC1 binds poly(A) tracts and inhibits NMD when tethered immediately downstream of a PTC (66), while PTBP1 blocks UPF1 association by binding polypyrimidine tracts in the same region (21). Similarly, hnRNP L confers NMD resistance by binding CA repeats downstream of NMD-targeted stop codons (67). p26 may function in a similar manner to protect some NMD targets by binding downstream of an NMD-targeted stop codon and preventing UPF1 association.",

To avoid the presence of sequencing artifacts at the 5\u2032 ends, the first 9 nucleotides were also removed. Sequence reads shorter than 20 nt or orphan reads were eliminated prior to a final quality check with FastQC.

The replicase-associated protein (p33) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (p94) (generated by ribosome frameshifting prior to the p33 termination codon) are translated from the gRNA, whereas the cell-to-cell and long-distance MPs (p27 and p26, respectively) are translated from a sgRNA that contains a 704-nt 3\u2032 UTR. Full-length transcripts of PEMV2 synthesized from the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter following agroinfiltration of N. benthamiana are capable of replication and movement independently of a helper virus (74); however, the enamovirus Pea enation mosaic virus 1 (PEMV1) is required for encapsidation and for transmission from plant to plant (75, 76).
