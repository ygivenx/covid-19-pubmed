            "text": "Gene expression analysis has become increasingly important in biological research where e.g. gene expression profiles from tissues associated with diseases and disorders have to be compared with each other and with those from normal tissues. One of the most powerful tools in this area is real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). To account for differences in starting material, RNA preparation, RNA quality and cDNA synthesis, adequate normalisation is frequently performed by comparing expression profiles of the genes of interest with those of constitutively expressed genes (= reference genes). Housekeeping genes are most widely used as reference genes, based on the assumption that they are constitutively expressed in most tissues and under certain circumstances, and that they are more or less resistant to cell cycle fluctuations [1,2]. However, it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of these genes may vary considerably in different tissues, different cell types and different disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease [3,4]. Housekeeping genes are not only involved in the basal cell metabolism, but appear to participate in other functions too, and therefore are prone to regulation [5-7]. Especially in tumours, the metabolism is generally elevated because of permanent proliferation and expansion. Moreover, some housekeeping genes may have a specific function essential for the tumour metabolism and therefore be up or down regulated [8]. Because of these findings, Vandesompele et al [9] proposed to identify a set of stable housekeeping genes in the tissue of interest and use them as internal reference genes for accurate normalisation.",

Equine sarcoids are fibroblastic skin tumours and are the most common tumours in horses. The disease not only induces esthetical defects, but also diminishes the economical value of affected horses [17]. Moreover affected horses show a genetic predisposition for the development of equine sarcoids, through which the breeding value of an animal with sarcoids sharply declines [18-20]. The bovine papillomavirus (BPV) plays an important role in the aetiology of equine sarcoids [21-23]. Several clinical types exist, ranging from small, stable patches to large, aggressive and fast growing tumours [24]. To be able to examine the gene expression profile of BPV in these different clinical types and to compare equine sarcoids with normal skin asymptomatically infected with BPV, a well suited internal control should first of all be established.",

During optimisation of the protocol, real-time PCR products were visualised by gelelectrophoresis and sequenced for verification. For every assay, a single amplicon with the expected size was generated without primer dimer formation. Indeed, the formation of primer dimers and unspecific amplification, which can falsely increase the gene expression levels, is a major point of attention, particularly when using intercalating dyes such as SYBR\u00ae Green.",

In equine sarcoids on the other hand, ACTB, B2M and UBB proved to be the most stable genes with TUBA1 being the least stable gene (Figure 1B(a)). When both sets of samples were analysed together, the results showed that the combination of 3 genes (ACTB, UBB and B2M) is sufficient for adequate normalisation (Figure 1C(a)).

However, including too many genes may increase the risk of using unsuitable genes, and is also impractical. On the other hand, if the cut off is made too stringent, stably expressed reference genes may be excluded and accuracy might drop. In order to determine how many reference genes should be included, normalisation factors (NFn), based on the geometric mean of the expression levels of the n best reference genes, were calculated by inclusion of an extra, less stable, reference gene according to Vandesompele et al [9]. Figures 1A(b), 1B(b) and 1C(b) show the pairwise variation Vn/Vn+1 between 2 sequential normalisation factors NFn and NFn+1 for normal skin, equine sarcoids and the combination of both kinds of samples. In all 3 cases, the inclusion of a 4th gene had no significant contribution (low V3/4 value) to the NF. The 3 member sets as described above are a good choice for the calculation of the NF.",

A whole range of tumours were sampled (one occult type, one verrucous type, one nodular type and five fibroblastic types). Three sarcoids were located on the medial part of the thigh, two in the axilla and two on the ventral side of the abdomen. Care was taken to obtain only tumoural tissue, without underlying normal stroma. Normal skin samples were obtained from healthy horses undergoing elective surgery or euthanasia (umbilical hernia, castration, osteochondrosis dissecans, dorsal displacement of the soft palatinum). Six of the samples were collected from the ventral abdomen, one from the throat region and one from the shoulder. All samples were freshly collected and stored immediately in RNAlater (Ambion). After overnight incubation at +4\u00b0C, the samples were frozen at -18\u00b0C until RNA extraction.",

Subsequently, approximately 4 \u03bcg of the total RNA solution, measured with the BioPhotometer (Eppendorf), were treated with 3 units DNase I (Ambion) to remove genomic DNA. This was followed by a spin-column purification (Microcon YM-10, Millipore). A minus RT control with primers for GAPDH was performed to check for successful removal of all the contaminating DNA. These primers were designed by the Primer 3 software [25] using publicly available sequences from the Nucleotide Sequence Database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [26]. The initial denaturation was performed at 94\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed. Each cycle involved a denaturation step of 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, followed by 30 seconds primer annealing at 61\u00b0C and 60 seconds primer extension at 72\u00b0C. After the last cycle, the PCR-mix was heated during 10 minutes at 72\u00b0C to become extension of the partially elongated primers.",
