            "text": "In 1796 Edward Jenner invented and tested a vaccine against the smallpox, an illness that had a very high index of mortality in the 18TH century [1]. The idea of Jenner was so successful that nowadays smallpox is practically eradicated and after this pioneering essay different vaccines were elaborated to prevent a long list of infectious diseases, from poliomyelitis to influenza. However, vaccines may present some lacks of efficiency and also some collateral effects. For example, in recent years some publications wrongly associated vaccination with autism [2, 3]. In spite of the overwhelming scientific evidence that such correlation is not actual, the belief that the results of vaccination could be worse than the illness itself spread through social networks and generated groups and movements against vaccination. Sometimes these groups are also related to some religion beliefs and/or rightists political tendencies or candidates. The debate about the efficiency of vaccination and its possible risks is then a very actual debate and a typical example of propagation of opinions, for and against vaccination. Thus, considering that opinions and contagion spreads in different ways, we will perform this study on a Network on Network. In recent years the study of complex Network of Networks (NoN) has been a subject of great interest for the scientific community, due to the large number of real word systems that can be mimic and study using these kind of topological structures [4\u20137]. A NoN is a system formed by single networks interacting through external connections between them. Many researches on NoN were focused in the study of cascade of failures [8\u201310], propagation of epidemics [11\u201314], and opinion dynamics [15\u201319] due to the ubiquitous of these processes that are present in the real scenarios. In particular, we are interested in processes that develop on NoN in which nodes belonging to different networks represents the same entities. This type of NoN are usually called multiplex networks. Epidemic spreading models have been particularly successful in understanding and predicting an epidemic outbreak and its period of extinction. Also, some models have incorporated a factor of human behavior, by considering the information and sources of information that individuals must handle, rational decisions and behavioral changes, in order to reach a more comprehensive understanding about the epidemic spreading [20]. A commonly-used model for reproducing spreading diseases dynamics in networks is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model [21\u201325]. This model has been successfully used to reproduce non recurrent diseases such as the H5N5 flu or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [26]. Besides, it has been extensively studied under the topology of multiplex networks [27\u201330]. The model groups the population of individuals to be studied into three compartments according to their state: the susceptible (S), the infected (I), and the recovered (R). When a susceptible node is in contact with an infected node it becomes infected with an intrinsic probability \u03b2, which we called the virulence of the disease, and after a period of time tr it recovers and becomes immune. Usually, the type of disease that this model describes has a period of infection that lasts for six or seven days on average, flu, for example.",

            "text": "The study of these models in real and synthetic networks [31, 32] have allowed researchers to develop different mitigation strategies for decreasing the impact of diseases on healthy populations [33\u201336]. These studies have been used in government policies to design vaccination campaigns. For instance, for seasonal diseases, such as influenza, vaccination campaigns are scheduled to begin before the epidemic spreads and in general this strategy is very effective [36]. Another strategy of prevention is the isolation for a certain period of time of individuals with infectious symptoms to prevent the spreading [34, 35]. Note that these scenarios are particularly interesting for epidemics spreading and the question that motivates this work is how the spread of the disease is influenced and co-evolves with the social context. Within the context of social phenomena, many empirical investigations show the importance of social influence in the formation of people\u2019s opinions. It is argued that two interacting partners may exert social pressure to change their attitudes approaching their opinions [37]. This particular social mechanism is named compromise [15, 38\u201340]. A less explored mechanism of social interactions is the persuasion [41\u201344]. Myers [41] observed in group discussion experiments that when two individuals talk, they do not only state their opinions, but they also discuss about the arguments that support their opinions. If they hold the same opinion, they could strength it by persuading each other with new arguments or reasons, becoming more extreme in their believes. In this context, La Rocca et. al [45] proposed and studied a model that explains the phenomena of polarization in a population of individuals that evolve under pairwise interactions, by implementing those two main social mechanisms of opinion\u2019s formation, i.e., compromise and persuasion [44, 46, 47]. This model, denoted as the M-model, has 2M different states describing the spectrum of possible opinion orientations on a given issue, from totally against (state x = \u2212M) to totally in favor (x = M), with some moderate opinions between these extreme values.",

[48] investigated the interaction between two social dynamics, one for opinion formation and the other for decision making, on two interconnected networks. The dynamics for opinion formation corresponds to the M-model proposed in [45], and the decision making dynamics is akin to the Abrams-Strogatz (AS) model [49, 50] originally introduced to study language competition, where agents can choose between only two possible options (x = \u00b11). In this model each agent may change its decision by a mechanism of social pressure, in which the probability of switching his present choice increases non-linearly with the number of neighbors that have the opposite opinion. They concluded that under certain parameters of the system, one model prevails over the other and dominates the behavior of the system.",

Thus, we will study the propagation of a disease in a population where all the individuals are continuously debating about getting vaccinated, considering that a susceptible individual is vaccinated if he is completely convinced about the benefits of the vaccine. However if after being vaccinated he catch the disease he becomes completely against the vaccination. For this purpose, and because the two processes occur on the same group of individuals, we studied the SIR model with vaccination and the M-model in a multiplex system composed by two networks. Both dynamics take place in different layers and co-evolve. Susceptible individuals become vaccinated if they acquire the state M in the other network, while the vaccinated individuals acquire the state \u2212M if they get infected.",

In this way, the group of individuals develop a dynamic of formation of opinions in which individuals interact expressing opinions about the importance or not of being vaccinated. When an individual has a fully positive opinion about the vaccine, he acts accordingly and gets vaccinated. In our model we do not consider parental decisions on children, so the opinion on vaccination motivates just individuals, not family groups.

Nodes in each layer represent the same agent, thus we connect through an external link a pair of nodes, each from different layer, allowing only one interlink by node. We construct each layer using the Molloy-Reed algorithm [51] considering the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) [52] degree distribution with \u2329k\u232a = 4. The propagation of the disease takes place in layer A and we fix the recovery time in tr = 6, which is in days the characteristic period of infection for a flu. Layer B is the social network, where the M-model rules the dynamic, with M = 2. As initial conditions we use for the layer B an uniform distribution for the densities of opinion, i.e., the same initial probability P+2,+1,\u22121,\u22122 = 1/4. In layer A we have initially only one agent infected, which is considered the patient zero and whose opinion is chosen at random between the four possible opinion states, a fraction 1/4 of the agents are vaccinated ones, as a consequence of their opinion state +2, and the rest are susceptible. We chose one source node of infection because this is the standard approach used by epidemiologists where most outbreaks starts with one person. At each time steps, we first let evolve the epidemic dynamic and then the opinion process. In layer A, we allow all the infected individuals to infect each one of their susceptible neighbors with probability \u03b2 and the vaccinated neighbors with a probability (1 \u2212 \u03c9)\u03b2. Then, in the opinion layer, we iterate over all the individuals and give each one of them the chance to interact with only one of its neighbors. This neighbor is chosen among those who can change the individual opinion. In case there is no neighbor that can change the opinion, nothing happen. Finally, we update all the opinions and epidemic states at the next time step. Notice that those infected individuals who had tr time step to spread the disease recover and those susceptible individuals whose opinion change to +2 change into the vaccinated state.

This is because as the vaccine becomes more effective, more people remain vaccinated and the propagation of the disease slows down. An efficiency above the threshold \u03c9 > \u03c9* is enough to ensure that an epidemic will not develop, such as the case of low values of \u03b2. For example for \u03b2 = 0.1 we need an efficiency of at least 55% in order to avoid the epidemic. On the other hand, above a certain value of \u03b2* the propagation of the disease is enhanced and it is impossible to prevent an epidemic. Even for \u03c9 = 1 there will be a macroscopic number of recovery individuals in the steady state. This is the case for the values \u03b2 = 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8.

As can see from Fig 2(c), for low values of efficiency Mag decreases as \u03b2 increases, for example, for \u03b2 = 0.8 agents opinion are in a polarized state (Mag = 0). This behavior is due to the fact that as \u03b2 increases more vaccinated agents gets infected, so their opinion change from 2 to \u22122, which means that more people become extremist against the vaccine. On the other hand, for an efficiency close to one, the opinion of the system is in average almost completely in favor of the vaccine, reaching a consensus where all the agents have the same opinion. Because the efficiency of the vaccine is high the vaccinated agents stay pinned in the opinion +2, pushing all the agents to adopt their opinion.

This is consistent with the fact that as \u03c9 increases the number of R decreases, which means that it is hard to spread the disease and therefore \u03c4 increases. The time of duration of the epidemic reaches a maximum at \u03c9* and then decreases because the spreading of the disease is diminish (there is no epidemic). Note that for \u03c9 > \u03c9* the majority of the agents in the system are vaccinated. We added an inset in Fig 2, (as well as in the following ones), comparing the duration of the epidemics with the derivatives of the number of recovered (R) and vaccinated (V) agents as a function of the efficiency. It is possible to see that there is an inflection point (a maximum in the derivatives) when the duration of the epidemics is maximum, meaning that the number of recovered and vaccinated agents increase at a lower rate when the efficacy of the vaccine is high than when the efficacy is low, going trough a maximum rate when the duration of the epidemics is maximum.",

Besides, for low values of \u03c9 and high values of \u03b2, Mag becomes negative because of the persuasive effect, which is not negligible. Agents with negative opinion are less likely to change their opinion. Also, since the vaccine is not much effective, vaccinated agents gets infected, thus their opinions change to negative and this contributes to a negative magnetization. On the other hand, we can see that for large values of \u03c9 the convergence time of both dynamics are similar, the Mag in the opinion dynamic is close to one, thus is close to the consensus state.

In this case, agents with extremist opinion tend to convince agents with moderate opinion to become extremists. From Fig 4(a) and 4(d) we can see that the behavior of R and the time duration of the epidemic \u03c4 are qualitative the same that for the two previous cases studied of r with different \u03b2*. Agents become extremist in their opinions and those who are against the vaccine have a small probability to be vaccinated. Then the disease spreads is promoted among the non vaccinated agents, which are an important fraction of the population. In Fig 4(b) and 4(c) we can observe that V and Mag increase as \u03c9 increases, and for the cases below \u03b2* (as \u03b2 = 0.1) both magnitudes increase with \u03c9 until reaching a peak around \u03c9* after which these magnitudes decreases. This is due to the fact that above the point \u03c9*, the time of the epidemic decreases as \u03c9 increases, and there is not enough time to convince the negative opinion agents to vaccinate.",

The attractor effect that generate the vaccinated agents in the opinion state is now hidden by the persuasive effect. The persuasive effect moves agents to the extreme opinions. When a vaccinated agent is infected, its opinion becomes a negative extremist and in this extremist society he will rarely change his opinion. For this reason, for all values of \u03b2 and low values of \u03c9 the Mag is always negative. On the other hand, for high values of the efficiency the average opinion of the system can be in favor or against depending of the virulence, but in general it is polarized and as a consequence, Mag closed to zero. Even for the case in which \u03c9 = 1 there still some agents that are against the vaccine. This is due to the fact that almost all agents that began with negative opinion remains in that state. Notice that the epidemic dynamics is faster than the dynamics of opinions -the convergence time is higher in layer B- making that the population never reach a consensus of opinions.",

            "text": "We mentioned before that there is a threshold \u03b2* above which the system always stay in an epidemic regime, independently of the efficiency of the vaccine, \u03c9. In Fig 5 we show \u03b2* as a function of r for tr = 6 and \u03c9 = 1. We set \u03c9 = 1, so that the vaccine is 100% effective, in order to know how strong the virulence of the disease has to be to win the best vaccination scenario. In addition, we also study this scenario for different values of initial vaccinated nodes -1%, 5% and 25%- to see how the initial conditions impacts on the evolution of both dynamics. As we can see from Fig 5, for a certain value of r, \u03b2* decreases as the initial vaccinated nodes decreases. This is consistent with the fact that having fewer initial vaccinated nodes causes the disease to spread more easily, so that less virulent diseases could become epidemic. As we can observe that the maximum values are around r \u2248 1, which means that a neutral society is optimal to prevent an epidemic. In a society with r << 1, compromise dominates the process of opinion formation and the agents tend to have a moderate opinion. This prevents those moderate agents from becoming extremists in favor of vaccination. The disease spreads through the non vaccinated agents very easily, even when the virulence is small. On the other hand, in a society with r >> 1, persuasion dominates the process of opinion formation and the agents tend to adopt extremists opinion. All extremists agents in favor of vaccination will be vaccinated, but those agents with a negative opinion (against the vaccine) have a small probability to be vaccinated because they will hardly change their opinion. In this case, the disease spreads very easily over these agents, which are an important fraction of the population. In a neutral society it is more likely for an agent with a positive moderate opinion to become an extremist in favor of the vaccine than in the case r << 1, and it is more likely for an agent against the vaccine to change his opinion in favor than in the case r >> 1. For this reason, \u03b2* is higher than in the other cases, because it is easier to convince people to get vaccinated, making more difficult for the disease to expand all over population.",

            "text": "In this paper, we studied the propagation of a disease in a population where all the individuals are continuously debating about getting vaccinated, considering that a susceptible individual is vaccinated if he is completely convinced about the benefits of the vaccine. For this purpose we used two-layer network where in one layer we use the SIR-model with vaccination for the propagation of a disease, and in the other layer we used the M-model (with M = 2), for the opinion formation process, where compromise and persuasion are the two processes involved and are controlled by the parameter r. We found that, in all the cases, the number of recovered agents decreases as \u03c9 increases, and this is due to the fact that as the vaccine becomes more effective, more people remain vaccinated and the propagation of the disease slows down. We found an epidemic threshold \u03c9* above which we ensure that an epidemic will not develop. Furthermore, we found that above a certain value of \u03b2* the propagation of the disease is enhanced and it is impossible to prevent it from becoming an epidemic. Even for \u03c9 = 1 there will be a final macroscopic number of recovery individuals in the steady state. We computed this threshold as a function of r, and we found that a neutral society is the best scenario to prevent an epidemic (r \u2248 1). When compromise dominates the process of opinion formation (r << 1), the agents tend to have a moderate opinion, making difficult that they become extremist in favor of vaccination. The disease spreads through the non vaccinated agents very easily, even when the virulence is small. On the other hand, when persuasion dominates the process of opinion formation (r >> 1) the agents tend to have an extremist opinion. All the extremist agents in favor of the vaccine will be vaccinated, but those agents with a negative opinion, which are an important fraction of the population, will be easily infected. In a neutral society it is more likely to convince those agents with a negative opinion in favor on vaccination, to become extremist in favor. With compromise and persuasion in the same proportion it is easier to convince people to get vaccinated, blocking the propagation of the disease and preventing it to expand all over the population. We can conclude that the influence of the opinion on the vaccination determines, in certain cases, whether or not the disease becomes in an epidemic.",
