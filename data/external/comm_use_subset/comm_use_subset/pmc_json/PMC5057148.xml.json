SNP frequencies were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both control groups with an exception for TLR4 rs4986791 (CAP controls). Several associations revealed in CAP and NP studies became non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons. However one observation is noteworthy. In the recent meta-analysis6 assessing the role of host genetic variations in susceptibility to several respiratory infectious diseases (tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-Coronavirus and pneumonia), the IL4 gene allele 2070874-T was the only variant associated with respiratory infections in the pooled group (tuberculosis and respiratory syncytial virus). The IL4 rs2243250-T allele which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the rs2070874-T allele (r2 = 1.0) was a susceptibility allele for NP in our study (Supplementary Table S2).",

HAP studies comprised the most heterogeneous group of observations. Sixteen studies indicated infectious pathogens (Supplementary Table S4), among them, five researches considered viral pneumonia. Deviations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls were reveled mainly in the studies of the IL10 SNPs (two works for each of the three considered polymorphic sites). Eighteen studies were performed in European population, two studies were conducted in Asian population, and three papers analyzed mixed population. All but four investigations were implemented in adult populations. Addressing pneumonia critical complications, the only available type of similar data in different studies was revealed for severe sepsis/septic shock in CAP/pneumococcal disease. In the analysis of this type of poor outcome, we also included our own results and data from the study of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in CAP patients (SIRS IV vs. SIRS I+II)14.",

Further meta-analyses were stratified by pneumonia type and ethnicity. In the article of Yuan et al.15 there were no data on ethnicity and a portion of patients with pneumonia in pneumococcal disease. After excluding the study of Yang et al.15 and three HAP studies, TLR2 rs5743708 minor genotype appeared to be associated with CAP/Legionnaires\u2019 disease/pneumococcal disease (Fig. 1). Sensitivity analysis showed that these results were not stable (Supplementary Table S5). An analysis for severe sepsis/septic shock/SIRS in CAP/pneumococcal disease was available only for the SNPs IL6 rs1800795 and IL10 rs1800896 with both series providing significant results (Fig. 2). The so-called \u201clow expression\u201d allele -174C (rs1800795) of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 was more frequent in patients with poor outcome (dominant model), while the so-called \u201clow expression\u201d allele -1082A (rs1800896) of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 protected against the development of severe critical conditions (dominant model).",

A total of 3612 studies were found on this theme by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge resources (Supplementary Figure S2). It was assumed that (i) different stimuli may be more or less specialized in their allele-specific influence on cytokine production; (ii) patients with different diseases may have pre-existing conditions that multi-directionally affect cytokine level. Taking into account these considerations, we limited a spectrum of analyzed studies by the use of pneumonia related pathogen stimuli and considered samples only from healthy volunteers. Additional treatment, if applied, was also indicated to compare results for different stimuli in the same studies. Data from genetic association studies of interleukin genes polymorphisms and ex vivo response to bacterial toxins are collected in Supplementary Table S6. Studies differed by population ethnicity, polymorphic sites, cellular sources, and in vitro incubation protocols. Several studies measured mRNA, but the majority assessed protein secretion. Due to high variability, we could not perform quantitative data synthesis and present here the results of qualitative analysis. Summary for IL10 investigations is given in a block diagram (Fig. 3a). The majority of studies have measured lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated IL10 production in association with IL10 -1082G/A (rs1800896) genotype or haplotypes including -1082 alleles and testified that IL10 -1082G allele may be a high producing allele. Since LPS is released from Gram-negative bacteria, the results should be extrapolated on Gram-positive species (e.g. Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus) with caution. Proportions of data with genotype-linked LPS-induced up-regulation, down-regulation or non-significant associations for all studied cytokines are shown in Fig. 3b,c. Proportions are given for the number of studies (Fig. 3b) and for the number of subjects in these studies (Fig. 3c). Data for cytokines other than IL10 could not be interpreted due to a small number of studies/subjects and contradictory associations. Similar analysis was not performed for toll-like receptor genes because genetic variations in these genes were mainly studied in association with cytokine expression.",

Summary data are provided in Fig. 4. Weak association trends (0.05 < P < 0.10 for at least one SNP in the gene) were seen for IL1B, IL4, IL13 and TLR4 genes (Supplementary Table S7). Significant but also weak associations (P - value in the range 0.02\u20130.045) were revealed for IL6 and IL10 SNPs (Supplementary Table S7).

Twenty seven SNPs including studied SNPs (IL10 rs1800896, IL6 rs1800795, IL1B rs16944, IL8 rs4073, IL4 rs2243250, TLR9 rs5743836 and rs187084) were identified in the putative promoter regions of the studied genes (2 kb upstream of a transcription start site). An in silico analysis of transcription factor DNA-binding specificity for two alleles at each SNP was conducted with RegSNP resource (http://viis.abdn.ac.uk/regsnp/Home.aspx) (Supplementary Table S8). Differences in allele-specific transcription factor DNA-binding ability in the whole set of twenty seven SNPs were predicted for in total 94 TFs.

The IL6 SNPs rs1800795 and rs1800797 (r2 = 0.97) affect binding affinity of GATA1, GATA2 and YYI TFs. The linked alleles rs1800795-G and rs1800797-G do influence on binding affinity of GATA1 and GATA2 factors in opposite directions (rs1800795-G has higher binding specificity, rs1800797-G has lower binding specificity), while the influence on transcription factor YYI affinity is unidirectional. We also used RegSNP resource for an analysis of transcription factors NF-1and Sp1 known to have a higher affinity for the rs1800795-C and rs1800896-G alleles respectively1819. These factors were not covered by the initial analysis due to the stringent cut-off settings (see please Materials and Methods). RegSNP results for these TFs as well as for the above mentioned GATA1 factor (higher affinity for the rs1800795-G allele20) were in line with literature data (Supplementary Table S8, Sheets 1 and 2). Finally, we performed an analysis of the nuclear factor NF-kB, which was shown to be induced by a majority of pneumonia-related pathogens (http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb/gene-resources/target-genes/). The IL10 SNP rs1800795 falls into low-affinity binding site for NF-kB, while the IL6 SNP rs1800896 exerts some influence on NF-kB sequence-specific affinity (allele C higher) (Supplementary Table S8, Sheets 1 and 2).",

First, alleles within one SNP could have increased or decreased affinity to different TFs. Second, GATA1-3 factors were highly overrepresented in our series: five of nine genes have SNPs that may influence GATA factors\u2019 binding affinity. Moreover, all SNPs with potential GATA factors binding sites have predicted allele binding score differences >0.20. Third, in the above analysis of the IL6 and IL10 SNPs we showed that SNPs within the same putative promoter region may change the protein-DNA binding affinity of a specific TF /TF family member. This observation was supported by data analysis of the other SNPs (e.g. SOX-related factors and IL10 SNPs; DCE SIII factor, Msn2/Msn4 factors and IL13 SNPs; CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPdelta and C/EBPbeta), HSF and IL4 SNPs; GATA family members and TLR2 SNPs (Supplementary Table S8).",

IL6, IL10 and TLR2 genes are of the greatest interest in regard with the results of our meta-analysis. Data for these genes are given in Fig. 6, while characteristics of the remaining genes are provided in Supplementary Figure S3. IL6 SNPs are in high LD; SNPs in putative promoter region, including rs1800795 have some regulatory potential, however the highest in silico functionality is predicted for the intron SNP rs2069832 which is adjacent to rs1800795 (distance 788 bp). IL10 SNPs are in weak LD; putative promoter SNPs including rs1800896 have little if any regulatory potential. Three IL10 SNPs were associated with diseases in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog (Supplementary Table S9). Several intron and 3\u2019downstream SNPs that are not linked with the SNP rs1800896 may be more functional than the latter one. An analysis of LD blocks and functional annotations of the IL6 SNPs shows that biological effects of these SNPs may be substantially influenced by the effects of proxy SNPs, while for the IL10 SNPs the influence of neighboring SNPs is not profound. The TLR2 functional variations are SNPs in coding regions, especially non-synonymous SNPs with known deleterious effects due to amino-acid change. Among SNPs in the other genes under study (Supplementary Figure S3), functional SNPs are located predominantly in the IL1B, IL13 and TLR9 gene; two SNPs in the IL13 gene and one SNP in the TLR4 gene have been associated with several disorders and traits in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog (Supplementary Table S9).",

Quality of a genetic association study depends on many factors, with sample size being among the most important among them. In addressing gene candidate studies of pneumonia, the largest sample size across all the studies was used by Martin-Loeches et al.13 followed by our CAP and HAP groups. Nevertheless, we did not obtain results significant after correction for multiple comparisons. This is a rather typical situation, since common polymorphic variants have low penetrance and cannot provide strong association effects, meanwhile, more sites are analyzed the less probability that results will remain significant after testing for multiplicity. In view of this, the revealed association of the IL4 rs2243250-T allele with NP, which is in line with the results of the recent meta-analysis (see please the Results section), seems worthwhile. Although IL4 is usually considered in regard to the immunoglobulin (Ig)-mediated allergic/inflammatory pathway, it is also known to influence humoral response during bacterial infection24 and suppress production of bacterial toxins-induced synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines25. IL4 affects pulmonary surfactant homeostasis26 and may be an important player in pulmonary clearance of bacteria and virus27. Given the results of allele-specific expression study28 together with the results of the meta-analysis of respiratory tract infectious diseases6 and data from our study, the rs2243250-T allele may be a genetic marker or a susceptibility allele in several respiratory infections.",

In contrary to the majority of other common diseases, which are often subjected to numerous and repetitive meta-analyses, pneumonia meta-analyses considered a narrow range of genes and have never been updated (with the exception for the IL6 association with pneumonia) (https://phgkb.cdc.gov/HuGENavigator/phenoPedia.do). Our study is the first to summarize data from individual papers on the role of TLR2 SNPs in pneumonia/pneumococcal infection. Among TLRs, TLR2 is a receptor with the widest range of recognized pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including PAMPs from Gram-positive bacteria29. There was no association of TLR2 with pneumonia in the whole set of meta-analyzed studies. Given that HAP is an extremely heterogeneous disease, we performed a stratified meta-analysis of CAP/Legionnaires\u2019 disease/pneumococcal disease studies. Minor genotype TLR2 rs5743708 GA/AA was associated with infection in this subset. To access an influence of amino-acid change (753 Arg > Gln) on enzyme structure and activity we utilized the HOPE resource30. The mutant residue differs from the wild-type one by size, charge and hydrophobic properties; multimer contacts peculiar to wild-type protein may be blocked in the mutant protein. To identify numerous PAMPs, TLR2 forms either homodimers or heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6. The TLR2 rs5743708 G to A transition leads to a functional deficiency in heterodimerization with TLR6 with subsequent diminished activation of intracellular signaling pathways31. This change in TLR2 function correlates with the observed influence of this SNP on susceptibility to infections632.",

Severe sepsis/septic shock were associated with the IL6 rs1800795 GC-CC and IL10 rs1800896 G/G genotypes. The result for IL6 was observed on the relatively large sample therefore it seems more reliable than the summary estimate for IL10 based on the smaller sample size. Data for the IL6 genotype GC-CC were also supported by its association with further worsening of critical illness from severe sepsis to septic shock in pneumonia patients3334. IL6 is a multi-functional cytokine with both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties and a central role in host defence35. IL10 is the most potent anti-immune and anti-inflammatory cytokine. In infection, it provides a balance between immunosuppression and immunostimulation to maintain a homeostatic state36. Since both cytokines are key players in orchestrating immune response, we assume that alleles that protected against severe complications in pneumonia patients (the IL6 rs1800795-G and IL10 rs1800896-A) may provide more effective regulation in the cytokine network in specific pathophysiological conditions.",

Ex vivo stimulated secretion of cytokines is considered to be more standardized assay than in vivo measurement of cytokine level. Ex vivo spontaneous cytokine production was declared not to occur or occur at low levels albeit with some exceptions37. Hence, in genetic association studies, the results of the ex vivo stimulation can be interpreted in terms of more or less inducibility for the carriers of different genotypes. There are many methodical circumstances influencing stimulated expression level, the most important of them, in vivo pre-existent conditions, the use of PBMCs vs. whole blood, the length of the incubation period, single or several concentrations of the stimuli applied and even the origin of this stimuli163738.

We explored 2 kbp 5\u2032-upstrem gene region of the studied genes for common SNPs and analyzed their sequence-specific influence on TF binding affinity. Our analysis showed that GATA1-3 factors were highly overrepresented in the set. GATA1-3 factors play a pivotal role in hematopoiesis but also are known to be involved in innate and adaptive immunity. They regulate immune response against different pathogens including those that may cause pneumonia52. Among other common TFs there were HSFs (heat-shock factors). SNPs that influence binding affinity of HSFs were located in anti-inflammatory cytokines IL4 (two SNPs), IL10 and in toll-lire receptor genes TLR4, TLR9. Functional activity of these SNPs may be mediated by HSFs\u2019 dependent activation of the anti-inflammatory limb of the immune response53. We also demonstrated that TF family members have similar allele-specific binding affinity (e.g. GATA factors, SOX-related factors) and linked alleles of SNPs may influence binding affinity of the same TF uni or multi-directionally. Clustering of TFBS for the same TF (homotypic clusters of TFBSs (HCTs)) is known to be enriched in promoters. It has been suggested that HCTs provide functional advantages being favorable for recruitment of TFs54.",

The TLR2 and TLR4 genes size was several times larger than the cytokine genes size. High LD was evident for the IL6, IL4 and IL8 genes while low LD was detected for the TLR2 and TLR4 genes. This means that the estimated genetic associations reflect non-independent effects of tightly linked SNPs in the IL6 and IL4 genes. The TLR2 SNP rs5743708 is not linked with the other functional TLR2 SNP rs5743704 hence the amino-acid change 753Arg > Gln (rs5743708) may solely contribute to the revealed association of the TLR2 gene with pneumonia.",

We combined own experimental data and the results of the meta-analyses with the analyses of the totality of published data (expression studies) and web-based resources. Our original analysis of transcription factors\u2019 affinity changes caused by SNPs did not and could not provide an unequivocal interpretation in terms of \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d allele-specific expression phenotypes.
