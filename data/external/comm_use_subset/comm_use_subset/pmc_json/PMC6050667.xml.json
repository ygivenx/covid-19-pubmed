            "text": "Codons are the basic genetic code of mRNA in all living organisms. There are 64 types of codons that encode 20 different amino acids; thus, codon degeneracy exists. In nuclear genomes, almost all amino acids, except for methionine and tryptophan, are encoded by two to six synonymous codons [1\u20133]. For different genes or genomes, the choices of synonymous codons are non-random, which is known as codon bias. Codon biases are specific to a given organism and can be influenced by GC content, gene expression levels, and gene lengths [4, 5]. Additionally, codon usage patterns may affect the mRNA biosynthesis, translational elongation speed, protein folding, and other biological functions downstream of expression [4\u20138]. Given the substantial biological effects of different codon patterns, identifying these patterns in a given gene or genome is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of expression and for revealing the effects of long-term evolution on a genome.",

            "text": "Currently, the most popular and widely accepted hypothesis that explains codon usage bias is mutation-selection balance, which proposes that codon usage reflects the combined effects of three evolutionary forces: mutation pressure, selection constraints, and genetic drift within a population [4, 6, 8]. In general, mutation pressure tends to shuffle A/U and G/C pairs to cause nucleotide composition bias, selection constraints lead to preferences for codons that maximise protein production efficiency in highly expressed genes, and genetic drift eliminates codon changes across generations as a result of immigration and emigration at the population level. The codon usage pattern of a given organism reveals the balance between these three forces and by employing widely used methods, such as effective number of codons (ENC) plots and neutrality plots, the driving forces and approximate contribution of each force to codon usage can be determined. Previous studies have shown that codon biases in microbes are generally driven by mutation pressure, as exemplified in Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, Zika virus, and Escherichia coli [9\u201311]. Among invertebrate animals, selection constraints are the major influence on codon usage, as demonstrated in taxa such as Drosophila melanogaster, Bemisia tabaci, and Taenia pisiformis [7, 12, 13]. These studies demonstrate that characterising codon usage and other relevant indices provides simple and intuitive strategies for examining complex evolutionary forces in many different species.",

            "text": "Hirudinaria manillensis (Hirudinidae: Arhynchobdellida: Annelida) is an ephemeral, blood-sucking leech of medium body size that parasitizes mammals [14]. An adult H. manillensis may consume more than 10 ml of blood per host and can cause substantial and ongoing pain. Even after the leech abandons the host, this pain can persist as bleeding continues due to the anticoagulants (e.g., hirudin) secreted by the salivary glands of the leech [14\u201316]. The remarkable anticoagulant characteristics of H. manillensis secreted proteins have attracted much interest and the animal is considered a useful model for designing natural coagulation inhibitors and anticoagulant drugs [15, 17, 18]. Progress in molecular biology has generated interest in the analysis of H. manillensis mRNA with the aim of revealing details about their nutritional requirements and mechanisms of expression of anticoagulants. It would be of great value to generate more reliable coding sequences for new gene discovery; furthermore, the genetic processes revealed by their codon usage patterns will further contribute to determining the effects of long-term evolution on the genetically diversified and unique physiological behaviour of medical leeches. Such information on codon usage could be applied to biological research as a molecular tool to edit or optimise mRNA sequences as a way to control gene expression.",

All identified unigenes and their annotations have enriched the current genomic sequences and can serve to further identify potential anticoagulant genes. We also attempted to determine the general driving evolutionary forces and to describe in more detail the differential evolutionary status for the identified anticoagulant genes. All high confidence unigene coding sequences (CDSs) were included to analyse codon usage bias, and the related indices and functional classifications. The general pattern of codon usage reflects the evolutionary process, and the differences in evolution between different metabolic mechanisms can be assessed by comparing these patterns. The results reported here will improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and mechanisms in H. manillensis, and will link the unique codon usage patterns of H. manillensis to specific genetic or genomic functions to help build a genetic profile for future research on the species.",

From these data, we assembled 115,132 raw transcripts and obtained 82,159 high-confidence transcripts. Using these 82,159 transcripts, we then identified 29,132 unigenes and 18,000 CDSs longer than 300 bp. The average lengths of the transcripts, unigenes, and CDSs were 1573.1, 1025.7, and 992.7 bp, respectively. Overall, the four nucleotides were asymmetrically represented in the CDSs. Adenine (A) was the most represented (29.3%), cytosine (C) was the least represented (23.0%), and there was little difference between guanine (G) (23.9%) and thymine/uracil (T/U) (23.8%) content. The GC content of the CDSs was 46.9%. To better understand the nucleotide base composition in H. manillensis, we measured the number of CDSs with different GC content levels. Almost all CDSs contained 30\u201360% GC content (Fig. 1a); thus, CDSs having GC contents lower than 30% or higher than 60% were considered as CDSs with extreme GC content. We further divided the 30\u201360% range into three smaller intervals and measured the number of CDSs attributable to each interval. The 42\u201350% interval contained the most CDSs, with numbers approaching or exceeding 1000, followed sequentially by the 50\u201360% and 30\u201342% intervals. This result corresponds with and to some extent explains the overall nucleotide composition of all H. manillensis CDSs measured.",

The ratios calculated using the observed frequencies over their theoretical frequencies, which are the mathematical products of the corresponding nucleotide content, are shown (Fig. 1c). For all four datasets, the dinucleotides were largely variable and unrelated to the expected unbiased frequency line. In the dataset that contained all CDSs, eight dinucleotides (AA, AG, CA, CU, GA, UC, UG, and UU) were more prevalent than the rest, with UA having the lowest frequency. Similar results were found in the 2nd & 3rd and 3rd & 1st databases, with only slight differences between them, while the ratios varied dramatically and lacked CG, UA, and UG pairs in the 1st & 2nd dataset.

The ENC value of 35 is highlighted in the plot, and the CDSs that have an ENC less than 35 are located under the highlighted line, they all have high GC3 values. Thus, we determined that codon usage bias was ubiquitous in H. manillensis and compositional constraint was not the determining factor driving codon preference, indicating that the pattern of codon usage in H. manillensis was caused by multiple factors as well as the composition of the ending dinucleotides. These other independent factors could be related to natural selection such as expression level or protein length, which may be more important than those related to mutation pressure.",

We used a Parity Rule 2 (PR2) plot to measure these biases in H. manillensis CDSs (Fig. 2c). Most of the points in our plot fell between 0.3 and 0.7 on both axes, indicating an overall low bias toward either A3/U3 or G3/C3 in H. manillensis. Furthermore, we divided the points into four quadrants centred on 0.5 to compare the quadrants and found that the third quadrant (in which the ratio of A3/AU3 and G3/GC3 < 0.5) contained substantially more points than the other quadrants, whereas the first quadrant contained the fewest points.

To explore the relationship between codon usage and gene expression levels, we selected CDSs of different genes that had fragments per kilobase million (FPKM) values above 1, and we plotted their log10 values against their ENC values. The purpose of calculating log 10 values in this situation is to condense the broad range of FPKM values. To further investigate the effects of genetic composition bias, we also labelled different points that represented the GC content of these CDSs. The upper and lower quartiles of the overall GC content in H. manillensis were 50.8 and 41.8% (Fig. 1b; above), respectively; therefore, we set three intervals for categorising different CDSs: GC < 41.8%; 41.8% < GC < 50.8%; and GC > 50.8% (Fig. 3). The three CDS groups with mostly overlapping distributions were found near the abscissa axis. The non-overlapped regions indicated that most genes with ENC < 50 were from the GC < 41.8% group, and the genes with ENC > 55 were from the 41.8% < GC < 50.8% group. Effects of selection were observed, indicating that the nucleotide substitution favoured GC and led to a stronger codon usage bias. However, on the vertical axis, neither the ENC values nor the GC content were separated from the FPKM values. This result indicates that the gene expression levels were generally unrelated to codon modifications, and that selection constraints of expression efficiency were not present. These results seemingly contradict each other, and to overcome this conflict we inferred that the overall expression profile was responsible. We reasoned that, to maintain general biological homeostasis, there must be many genes that are highly expressed but are not codon-modified due to their vital functions. Under selection, these genes would maintain their functions and eliminate codon changes that would jeopardise these functions. Therefore, genes with codon modifications would have higher expression efficiency due to adaptive selection forces, but the effects would be hidden among other genes.",

Additionally, G-ending codons were extensively distributed across three quadrants, which is the most varied among all codons. RSCU usage values for C- and G-ending codons occurred independently of codon type, indicating that the C- or G-favouring usage bias was driven predominantly by selection constraints.

Codon usage bias is affected by protein length, and we have inferred that they might be negatively related. To test our hypotheses, we plotted ENC against protein length, yielding results that supported our hypothesis (Fig. 4d). There was a Gaussian distribution between protein length and ENC. Short protein products that contained less than 200 amino acids had the greatest variation in ENC values. The majority of data points were distributed between ENC values of 50 and 55. Of the factors used in this analysis, length explained the greatest variation in ENC values, with results ranging by a factor of 10 between the lowest and highest values. These observations indicated that protein length affected codon usage as a result of selection constraints. Although an overall weak codon bias was not exclusive to proteins of certain lengths, longer protein products had a weaker codon usage bias. Conversely, shorter proteins did not particularly affect the codon usage; therefore, their usage patterns were predominantly shaped by other selective forces.",

This result agreed with our finding that amino acid composition had little impact on codon usage. Thus, it is unlikely that codon usage bias in H. manillensis is influenced by hydrophobicity or aromaticity.

Their codon usage patterns, which were calculated as GC12/GC3 ratios and ENC values, were compared to the average values obtained from all CDSs to measure the effects of different evolutionary states of anticoagulant-related mechanisms. In particular, we aimed to examine whether the anticoagulant genes had more adaptive modifications, which would help in understanding the evolutionary mechanism that drives anticoagulant characteristics. The results showed that 20 unigenes that encode genes such as hirudin, heparin, and eglin have plotted data points that are above the average GC12/GC3 ratios and ENC values, indicating generally weaker codon usage than average (Fig. 5). The effects of modifications on the codons for most direct anticoagulant genes were relatively relaxed, indicating that they were less adaptively evolved than were other parts of the genome, and that the genomic profile for the blood diet in H. manillensis matured before this species evolved from its ancestor. Moreover, we found that the four genes that encode serpin, filcolin-like 1, thrombospondin type 1, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein had lower ENC values than average. In particular, thrombospondin type 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein also had a GC12/GC3 ratio below average.

However, codon bias was limited overall. Because many codons are used during translation, we further hypothesised that extreme codon usage bias may only develop in particular or limited conditions. Additionally, our results show that G and particularly C are more common in third codon positions than expected. Third-position codon bases are directionally substituted, possibly because of effects from natural selection or mutation pressure. Identifying which of these forces drive the preference for C-ending codons helps elucidate the roles different forces can play in the evolution of H. manillensis. Because synonymous codons are not equivalent by their nature, the preference for ending bases may be caused by directional substitution, as a result of selection constraints acting against a background of mutation pressure. Our results indicate that overall expression levels regulate genomic composition and modify codon usage bias. The direction of this bias manifests as increased expression that leads to stronger codon usage bias and more mutational substitution toward GC. Thus, selection plays a dominant role in shaping the codon usage bias in H. manillensis. Future efforts to identify factors that lead to codon usage bias via base selection, including expression levels, protein lengths, and amino acid proportions, will provide greater understanding of the formation of particular codon usage patterns.",

According to the mutation-selection-drift theory, selection constraints can direct a preference toward codons that promote translation efficiency. Values such as FPKM can be essential for these types of analyses; thus, previous studies that were unable to obtain absolute results were obliged to use one of several theoretical indices to measure expression rates, such as CAI, codon bias index (CBI), or frequency of optimal codons (Fop) [20\u201323]. Although these indices are statistically valid and have helped describe the formation of codon usage patterns in several species [4, 12, 24, 25], their use remains problematic because of their dependence on the correct identification of optimal codons, which vary between genes and organisms and do not always promote translation efficiency. For instance, in humans, cell- and tissue-specific tRNA composition is determined solely by translational elongation rates and optimal codons have no effect on this determination [26\u201328], which limits the ability to make certain predictions from transcriptional data. Accordingly, we conclude that using FPKM values (actually, the log10-transformed values) for genes obtained from transcriptome data generate more accurate results and that these values also help refine existing theories for the calculation of codon usage indices.",

These CDSs could be divided into different categories and comparison of these categories could be used to measure the differential effects of the relevant selection pressures in H. manillensis. We plan to use these comparisons in future studies to identify and characterise economically valuable components of the H. manillensis genome, such as genes that contribute to anticoagulant production.

The overall codon usage bias that we detected in H. manillensis was not extreme, but did show a preference for GC-ending codons, particularly C-ending codons. Similar biases have been detected in other species, but mostly invertebrates [12, 13, 19, 22, 33\u201335]. In the leafhopper Homalodisca coagulata, 11 out of 15 preferred codons ended in C [12], and in the cestode T. pisiformis, 17 out of 32 preferred codons were GC-ending, with 12 ending in C [13]. Similar patterns across species that suggest long-term evolution in codon usage could be regulated by common biological mechanisms in invertebrates. The factors affecting codon bias in other species are likely to contribute to the codon bias that we characterized in H. manillensis as well. The uniqueness of codon usage in H. manillensis could be related to the different evolutionary forces that contributed to the preferences for specific usage effectors, including nucleotide composition, gene expression, and protein length.",

In these cases, ENC values deviated from expectations. GC12 was positively correlated with GC3, and GC12 was lower than GC3, which are consistent with the results we presented for codon usage patterns in H. manillensis. The ENC values for the CDSs we examined did not follow the standard expENC curve, but GC12 did correlate with the shallow but linear slope (0.3201) of GC3. Although some ENC values fell on the expected curve, we believe that they do not refute the overall pattern of random codon usage in this species; the random codon usage that we identified was most likely caused by strong selection over long periods of evolution, which is the driving force behind existing codon usage bias in H. manillensis.",

The overall effect of gene selection is the maintenance of efficient gene expression; however, selection pressure from previous translation processes, also known as the translation elongation rate, or certain subsequent protein products could also contribute to this selection process. Previous studies have shown that both conditions occur in different species. In many viruses such as bovine coronavirus or Zika [10, 37], protein products are not contributing factors, whereas in plants like Zea mays [38] the effects of proteins products are significant. In our study, we investigated factors such as nucleotide content, expression levels, amino acid composition, protein length, hydrophobicity, and aromaticity to evaluate their relationships with codon selection. Of these factors, only protein length had selective effects on codon usage; however, the effects of protein length were strictly determined by CDS length and overall, attributable to the translation elongation rate. Thus, we conclude that codon usage bias in H. manillensis is shaped only by translational mechanisms, the final protein products of which may be sufficiently conserved to be excluded from evolutionary processes.",

            "text": "In H. manillensis, we identified preferred codons that used all four bases; however, the distribution of ending bases was uneven and favoured GC-ending codons. One possible explanation for this result is that preferred codons undergo selection that modifies ending bases from AU to GC over long-term evolution. According to the mutation-selection-drift theory, preferred codons are selected because they better match the tRNA genes that promote translation efficiency [4]. Because we identified selection as the dominant force in H. manillensis evolution, we hypothesised that GC-ending codons would increase in frequency with increased gene expression. This speculation was largely supported by our comparative analysis of ENC and GC content between the highest and lowest expressed genes in H. manillensis. We suggest that richer and more stable GC content in codons facilitates a more efficient use of tRNA in H. manillensis, as tRNA is the foundation of genetic mechanisms. As in many invertebrates [13, 19, 34, 35], preferred codons tend to include GC, and we suggest that this tendency is exhibited by other species and could be strengthened further by evolution. Understanding these preferences facilitates the editing and promotion of the in vivo expression of target genes in H. manillensis.",

            "text": "Many previous studies have examined the molecular mechanisms and identified several functional genes in different types of leeches [16, 18, 39\u201341]. The genes that encode hirudin, heparin, bdelin, and eglin have been characterised and are well known as typical anticoagulant-related sequences in medical leeches [39\u201341]. The results of our gene annotations were largely similar to those reported in previous studies, which confirmed these as functional genes. Using these genes as examples enabled us to evaluate their evolutionary status in H. manillensis. Codon usage is predominantly affected by environmental forces and can be used to infer the differential effects of long-term evolution. The overall codon usage pattern could be representative of the current genetic nature of this species, while the draft status of these genes is more or less modified by differentiation during adaptation to specific environmental conditions. Thus, we inferred the existing adaptions in these functional anticoagulant genes and found that relaxed selection likely occurred. The majority of blood-diet-related genes have undergone less adaptive evolution in H. manillensis, except for those with homologous sequences in the host species. Based on these findings, we further suggest that the basic evolutionary mechanisms of genes in H. manillensis, especially genes common in other phylogenetically related leeches, have promoted genes that have undergone less adaptive selection than their genome due to their mature molecular mechanism. Only genes that have newly participated in evolution will be modified by stronger selection, as revealed in their codon usage.",

The nature and functional pathways of all genes were identified in this species, and the effects of different evolutionary factors on codon usage were characterised and measured. As with other invertebrates, we found that in H. manillensis there is a preference for GC-ending codons, particularly those ending in C, and concluded that the primary contributing force to this preference is selection rather than mutation. These conclusions contribute to our knowledge of the H. manillensis genome, improve our understanding of invertebrate genomics, and provide further validation of genomic tools for indirectly measuring evolutionary processes.",

For RSCU values, a standard codon table was chosen. The ENC values, which represent the capacity for codons to encode amino acids and are negatively related to codon bias, were calculated automatically in CodonW while calculating RSCU. These two parameters were used to describe codon usage patterns. Several indices such as the overall GC content, GC content at the first, second, and third codon positions (GC1, GC2, GC3), amino acid composition, protein length, aromaticity (AROMO) values, and general average of hydrophobicity (GRAVY) values were also calculated. In particular, reliable nucleotide content for single nucleotides and dinucleotides, amino acid composition, and protein lengths were conducted in DAMBE and validated using CodonW. GRAVY and AROMO values represent the mean frequency of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids among gene products, respectively, and were calculated in CodonW. All these results can be accessed in Additional files 1, 2, and 3. Additional file 1 contains the values of ENC, expected ENC, GC content, protein length, GRAVY, and AROMO.

To make this plot, we submitted 1000 strictly increasing GC values from 0.001 to 1.000 to DAMBE to obtain their expENC values. These values were then used to draw a standard curve; a smooth curve was selected to connect these value points.

PCA can be used as a dimensionality reduction tool to significantly reduce the data complexity by using principal components to reflect overall patterns. With this method, a matrix comprising complex RSCU values can be transformed into just a few major axes.

We selected four principal components among the RSCU values and two major groups were correlated with GC content to assess whether GC was a contributing factor to RSCU values. The PCA of RSCU values in the CDSs of unigenes was used to separate codons, whereas the PCA of the proportion of amino acids was used to measure cumulative inertia and identify patterns in amino acid usage. PCA initially produces a series of orthogonal axes that can classify trends that represent variation in the data, with each subsequent axis contributing a smaller proportion to the variation. PCA locates each codon or amino acid on these axes and the location is the combination of columns (codons or amino acids) and rows (genes) and is highly distinguishable between different groups.",
