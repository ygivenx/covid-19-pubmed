            "text": "There has been significant progress in the development of vaccines and therapeutics against viruses, but there are still major gaps in medical therapy for some of the most common types of viral infections. For these types of infections, vaccines can still be ineffective due to new and emergent strains and can exhibit significant off-target effects [1], [2]. Similarly, the efficacy of antiviral therapeutics can often be limited by pathogen resistance as another sign of the difficulty in keeping up with rapidly evolving viral genomes [3]\u2013[9]. An alternative to agents that specifically and directly target the virus itself is the possibility of improving natural host defense against a broad range of viruses. Although antiviral defense exhibits significant complexity and redundancy, one system that stands out as a useful target for improvement is the one based on the action of interferons (IFNs). And within this IFN system, which is similarly complex, the STAT1 transcription factor is remarkable as a central component that is critical for the functional activity of each type of IFN (Figure 1). Consequently, genetic loss of STAT1 function causes a marked susceptibility to viral infection in mice and humans [10]\u2013[12]. Moreover, modification of STAT1 to a form) that improves the efficiency of IFN signal transduction can result in improved control of viral infection [13]. These observations indicate that the IFN-signaling pathway is subject to a so-called \u201crheo-STAT\u201d adjustment wherein down-regulation causes increased susceptibility to viral infection whereas up-regulation might lead to increased efficiencies for IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and control of infection [14].",

            "text": "In the present study, we aimed to mimic the beneficial actions of STAT1 modification with a small molecule that also enhances the activity of the IFN signaling pathway. We describe here the development of a high-throughput screening (HTS) system for novel small molecular weight compounds (so-called \u201csmall molecules\u201d) that might increase ISG expression and antiviral activity. To develop this screening system, we generated cell lines that stably express the human interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) driving a luciferase reporter gene. The ISRE gene promoter element is responsible for type I IFN signaling that mediates host defense against a wide range of viruses [15], [16]. After establishing that the ISRE-reporter cell line responded linearly to IFN-\u03b2 concentration and treatment time, we converted the assay to an automated format for a screen against already approved or approvable drugs. We also screened a library of phosphatase inhibitors that might mediate increased STAT1 phosphorylation-activation. Our analysis identified a series of diverse compounds capable of significantly increasing ISRE activity. One compound in particular, the anthracycline antibiotic idarubicin hydrochloride, was used to explore mechanism of action and to validate the proposal that small molecules can enhance ISRE activity to drive higher levels of ISG expression and improved control of viral level. The findings provide for the concept that current antiviral therapeutics act directly and specifically on viral proteins whereas next-generation antivirals might act to enhance host immunity against a broad range of viruses. Either alone or together, these approaches might better address the current need for more effective treatment against common as well as new and emergent viral infections.",

We used 2fTGH cells (the parental line for STAT1-deficient U3A cells) as well as HEK293T cells that both express endogenous STAT1. Clonal lines showing IFN-\u03b2-inducible ISRE-promoter driven luciferase activity were designated 2fTGH- or HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells. For initial assay development, we used the 2fTGH- and HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells to establish an optimal luciferase light reaction time for both cell-lines. Based on luminescence signal stability over the time course of the reaction, an optimal readout window of 40\u201370 min after the start of the reaction was chosen for subsequent experiments (Figure 2B). After optimization of cell growth time, response to various IFN-\u03b2 treatment times and concentrations were tested in 2fTGH and HEK293T cell lines. Each cell line exhibited a distinct IFN-\u03b2 treatment time for maximal signal: 7\u201312 h for 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells and 14\u201324 h for HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells. Although a lower signal magnitude was obtained with 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells compared to HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells, the 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells show more specificity for IFN-\u03b2 (compared to IFN-\u03b3) treatment at all IFN-\u03b2 treatment time periods tested (Figure 2E) and over a range of IFN-\u03b2 (and IFN-\u03b3) concentrations (Figure 2F, G). Thus, the 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells were chosen for further assay development.",

These treatment conditions were duplicated on a second plate. Each assay plate also contained control wells containing a range of IFN-\u03b2 concentrations (0\u2013200 U/ml) in quadruplicate (Figure 3A).

Nonetheless, idarubicin is best known as an anti-neoplastic agent that acts via DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition [25]. To determine whether the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity is related to topoisomerase II inhibition, we tested three other potent topoisomerase inhibitors Etoposide, Hu-0331, and ICRF-193 up to concentrations known to cause topoisomerase II inhibition [26]\u2013[28]. In contrast to idarubicin, these other compounds caused no significant increase in ISRE activity (Figure 5E). In fact, two of the topoisomerase inhibitors (Etoposide and Hu-0331) caused a decrease in ISRE activity in concert with cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations. These findings indicate that the capacity of idarubicin to activate the ISRE component of the IFN signaling pathway occurs independently of topoisomerase inhibition. Together, the findings provide evidence of idarubicin capacity to increase ISRE activity independent of the anti-neoplastic properties of the drug.",

For example, the EC50 for idarubicin decreased as the concentration of IFN-\u03b2 increased (Table 2). These findings suggested that idarubicin might somehow interact with the IFN signaling pathway. In that regard, we also found that the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity was observed under baseline conditions when there was no detectable production of endogenous IFN-\u03b2 and no administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (data not shown and Figure 5A).

In the present experiments, we found that idarubicin treatment (at a relatively low concentration of 25 nM) caused a significant decrease in EMCV titer at baseline and with IFN-\u03b2 treatment (at a relatively low concentration of 5 U/ml) (Figure 8A).

Similarly, other investigators have attempted to boost IFN production, e.g., through administration Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists CpG or Imiquimod, but these agents have also caused similar side effects [30]\u2013[33]. The small molecule DMXAA activates multiple immune pathways (NF-\u03baB, TBK1/IRF3, NOD, and MAP kinase) but was ineffective as an antiviral unless it was administered before infection [34]\u2013[37]. To circumvent at least some of these issues with IFN production, toxicity, and specificity, we therefore pursued the goal of antiviral drug discovery with a novel screening approach for identifying small molecule enhancers that might selectively boost the activity or efficiency of the IFN signaling pathway.",

In this work, we demonstrated that a designer form of STAT1 (designated STAT1-CC based on double-cysteine substitutions) was able to enhance IFN signaling and better control viral replication [13]. Although STAT1-CC gene expression would be challenging to translate to practical application, the mechanism of action served as a guide to design a screening strategy to identify small molecules that could mimic the antiviral benefit. In that regard, we also recognized that phenotypic screening approaches have proven to be more effective than target-based approaches for the discovery of first-in-class small molecule drugs [38]. Thus, target-based approaches (defined as direct drug action on a particular target) allow for analysis and refinement of structure and function but can also waste resources when the molecular hypotheses used to design screening assays may not be relevant to the disease. Meanwhile, phenotypic screening can take longer in terms of hit-to-lead development but provide more proteins in the pathway to be targeted and do not require prior knowledge of molecular mechanisms of action. Most importantly, the activity found in phenotypic-based approaches is often more effectively translated into therapeutic impact in disease models. For the present work, we take advantage of both of these strategies to some extent and devise a screen that incorporates molecular mechanism (i.e., enhancing a specific type of IFN signaling pathway) and the need to achieve phenotype (i.e., identifying any compound that could increase this type of signaling pathway regardless of specific mechanism).",

Subsequent validation assays demonstrated that idarubicin facilitates STAT1-dependent ISG expression and STAT1-directed control of viral replication and cytopathic effect. While others previously reported the antiviral properties of anthracyclines some time ago, no mechanism of their antiviral action was elucidated [46]\u2013[48]. In the present study, we observed drug-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-range similar to those reported previously [23], [24], however, we establish that the effect of idarubicin on the antiviral IFN pathway is independent of cytotoxicity and topoisomerase inhibition. Because idarubicin enhances the IFN signaling pathway output, we questioned whether the drug might also cause IFN-driven cell death. However, we found no increase in cytotoxicity in cells treated with idarubicin and IFN together compared to cells treated with idarubicin alone. We also found that the idarubicin concentrations for activating the ISRE component of the IFN signaling pathway were significantly less than those required for major cytotoxicity. Thus, we conclude that idarubicin effect on IFN signaling is distinct from the effect on DNA-based cytotoxicity. The dose dependency of these effects underlines the need to conduct screening at multiple concentrations of test compounds, particularly lower concentrations that prevent false negative hits due to cytotoxic effects.",

Our data further show that the enhancing effect of idarubicin is based on ISRE activation and ISG expression independent of IFN production or IFN\u2013IFN-receptor interaction, since the effect of idarubicin is unchanged by IFN-receptor blockade. These findings suggest that idarubicin activation of the ISRE is due to an action in the IFN signaling pathway distal to ligand-receptor binding, e.g., at the level of receptor-associated JAK kinases or further downstream at the formation, transport, binding, and/or assembly of the ISRE transcriptional complex. In that regard, anthracyclines are known to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis by intercalating between base pairs of the DNA/RNA strand to prevent replication, but whether this mechanism can affect ISRE or other gene promoter elements still needs to be defined. The present screening approach overcomes the uncertainty in molecular mechanism by using a phenotypic (rather than a target-based) screening approach and thereby captures compounds that increase the activity of the IFN signaling pathway by either established or undefined mechanisms.",

This approach is designed to lead to discovery of drugs with activity against a broad range of viruses for clinical application as well as experimental tool compounds to further understand IFN-dependent immune mechanisms. Current approaches to defining the basis for IFN signal transduction, particularly in vivo, often rely on complex transgenic and gene targeting approaches. Thus, the use of small molecule enhancers (SMEs) of the IFN signaling pathway may provide much greater flexibility and ease of application to achieve transient adjustment of IFN-related actions and consequent scientific and clinical benefit. Our approach should thereby prove useful to discover drugs with activity against a broad range of viruses as well as effectiveness in other conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis and melanoma) where the efficacy of IFN treatment might benefit from enhancing the IFN signaling pathway.",

A separate plate was made for each of the four compound concentrations (0.24, 1.2, 6 and 30 \u03bcM). The Twister II, Sciclone, Orca, and Liconic cold storage incubator handled this step. For the second step, cells were plated at 8000 cells per well in 384-well assay plates (n = 56). This step was accomplished in seven batches (8 assay plates per batch) using the Sciclone. A uniform suspension of cells was maintained by intermittent mixing on the Sciclone deck between cell plating. Simultaneously, the compound stock plates were sealed using the Flexiseal and stacked back into a Twister II rack for storage. For the third step, cells were allowed to grow for 11 h and then were treated with compound and IFN solutions. This step required that a plate containing cells be brought from the Cytomat incubator to the Sciclone deck in concert with a set of compound/IFN dilutions plates from the cold storage incubator. Cell treatments were timed so that each assay plate would be incubated for 10.3 h before the final step of performing the luciferase assay.

Replicates for a given compound at a given dose (N = 2 for each dose/compound combination) were then mean summarized. A z-score threshold of \u22652 was chosen to identify potential hits. Thereafter, to reach a smaller and tractable set of hits to validate experimentally, we took advantage of testing each compound at four concentrations. Specifically, we used self-organizing maps analysis to cluster hit compounds by shape of the dose-response curve. The significance of change from dose to dose (0.24 to 1.2, 1.2 to 6, and 6 to 30) was also analyzed using linear models and moderated F-statistics as implemented in the limma package [57] in Bioconductor [55]. The concentration-response curves for each compound were then visually inspected, using scatter plots generated in TIBCO Spotfire DecisionSite (TIBCO, Palo Alto, CA), with respect to the shape of the curve and reproducibility between replicates. Compounds showing an erratic concentration-response (e.g. increase, then decrease, and increase again in ISRE activity with increasing concentration) were rejected. Compounds with a consistent increase or decrease in response with increasing drug concentration or good efficacy at any concentration were included for further validation.

Comparison of candidate normalizer gene expression between various IFN treatment and infection conditions using multiple software packages [66 68] led to the selection of the OAZ1 as the normalizer gene. Primers and probes for real-time quantitative PCR assays were designed using the ProbeFinder design algorithm (Roche Applied Science). For OAS1, 5\u2032-ggtggagttcgatgtgctg-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-aggtttatagccgccagtca-3\u2032 were used as forward and reverse primers, along with UPL probe #37 (Roche Applied Science). A plasmid containing OAS1 transcript variant 2 cDNA (Ref ID NM_002534, Origene, Rockville, MD) was used as a standard for absolute quantitation of OAS1 copy number. For GBP1, 5\u2032-ttccaaaactaaaactctttcagga-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-tgctgatggcattgacgtag-3\u2032 were used as forward and reverse primers, along with UPL probe #85. A plasmid containing the GBP1 cDNA (Clone ID: 3606865, Thermo Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) was used as a standard. The IDT PrimeTime pre-designed assay Hs.PT.42.328511.g (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) was used for OAZ1. A cDNA vector was used for OAZ1 as well (Clone ID: LIFESEQ913650, Thermo Open Biosystems). Data were collected on a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche Applied Science). Quantification cycle values were calculated using a second derivative maxima algorithm as implemented in the Lightcycler 480 software.",

Cells were then washed twice and cultured in medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 28 h. At that time, cell supernatants were used to determine viral titer based on real-time quantitative PCR assay for EMCV RNA with 5\u2032-ctgccttcggtgtcgc-3\u2032 (forward primer), 5\u2032-tgggtcgaatcaaagttggag-3\u2032 (reverse primer), and 5\u2032caaggttttgagcgtgtctacgatgtgg-3\u2032 (probe). A TA plasmid containing the EMCV 3D protein was used as a standard for absolute quantitation of viral copy number. In addition, cell viability was determined using the Cellomics Arrayscan VTi high content imager (Thermo Scientific). For this assay, 15 images per well were obtained with a 10x objective. After background subtraction, cells were identified by nuclei stained by cell permeable dye Hoechst 33342. Propidium iodide fluorescence was quantified by defining a boundary of 2 pixels around the nuclei and then gating on a cell population that showed higher staining. For each sample replicate, cytotoxicity was calculated as the percentage of cells that showed increased propidium iodide staining based on samples of at least 5000 cells per well.",
