A loading dose of 4400 IU/kg followed by 2200 IU/kg/hour for 12 hours (UK-12 h) is recommended for acute PE treatment by American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guideline[3]. However, earlier studies have showed that the bleeding incidence of this regimen was high [4,5]. Reducing infusion time to 2-h have demonstrated promising results with decreased major bleeding rate. Additionally, we have observed that the UK-2 h (20 000 U/kg over 2 h) regime has superior thrombolytic effects over the UK-12 h regimen for fresh thrombi in a canine PE model [6]. Because of the potential advantages of lower bleeding risk, increased effectiveness for fresh thrombi, convenience and lower cost, UK-2 h becomes a promising regimen. However, there is no direct comparison between this regimen with the ACCP recommended UK12 h regimen.",

Increasing evidence suggests that UK infusion dosage and duration can be reduced further. It has been shown that 3 million IU UK infusion over 2 h followed by heparin therapy is as effective and safe as the rt-PA 100 mg over 2 h regimen [18,19]. A much lower dose of 20 000 IU/kg UK over 2 h has been shown to be effective without severe bleeding and allergic reaction [20]. In this study, we demonstrated that UK-2 h regimen, a much lower dose (20 000 IU/kg) than those used in previous trials (3 million IU/2 h)[18,19], produced similar improvements in pulmonary circulation and right heart dysfunction as the UK-12 h regimen. In our practice, we use thrombolytic therapy instead of anticoagulation therapy alone to treat patients with extensive pulmonary artery obstruction (defined as an obstruction exceeding 50% of the pulmonary vasculature or the occlusion of two or more lobar arteries)[21,22], combined with echocardiographic signs of RV overload. Even presented with normal systemic arterial pressure, these patients are at risk of deteriorating conditions and have worse prognosis [23,24]. Studies have shown that these patients may benefit from thrombolytic therapy [25,26]. The current guideline also suggests that thrombolytic therapy may be considered in selected patients with intermediate risk PE after thorough consideration of conditions increasing the risk of bleeding[3,27]. In this study, we therefore included these patients.",

Nevertheless, future studies with anticoagulation control in patients with intermediate risk PE will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed beneficial in these patients. Currently, giving LMWH is not a routine practice for high risk PE patients. However, subcutaneous injection of LMWH has been shown to produce greater efficacy, less hemorrhagic risk, and improved convenience in clinical research and practice.

Therefore, we could not draw a confirmed conclusion. Further studies with larger sample size are desirable to determine the efficacy and safety of this UK 2 h regimen.

Future studies with anticoagulation control will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed beneficial in these patients. The PEITHO (Pulmonary EmbolIsm THrOmbolysis) study [30] is on going to determine whether thrombolysis can improve the outcome of patients presenting with high-risk submassive acute PE compared with anticoagulant alone, which will demonstrate the clinical benefits of tenecteplase over placebo in normotensive patients with acute PE and right ventricular dysfunction. Few randomized trials have assessed the potential long-term benefits of thrombolytic therapy in acute massive PE except the study reported by Meneveau et al [31]. The study suggested that a 2-h regimen of streptokinase can be routinely used in patients with massive PE and maintained cardiac output without obviously compromising efficacy or safety. The long-term follow-up study would provide more valuable information on thrombolytic therapy.",

Given the convenience, lower cost and the similar efficacy and safety as the UK-12 h regime, we suggest that body weight adjusted UK-2 h regimen could be used for PE treatment. Further studies are required to evaluate the short and long-term outcomes of these different UK thrombolytic regimens.",
