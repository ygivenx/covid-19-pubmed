The Large (L) segment, encodes the matrix protein (Z), and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase [1]. The Small (S) segment, encodes the nucleoproteins (NPs) and glycoproteins (GP) [1]. Initially, arenaviruses were thought to only infect mammals; however, recently arenaviruses have been identified as the causative agent of inclusion body disease in the boid family of snakes [2]. Hence, Arenaviruses have been separated into two genera on the basis of their natural reservoir hosts; mammarenavirus, which infect mammalian hosts, and reptarenavirus which infect reptilian host species [3]. Among the mammarenavirus genera, there is further subdivision into the Old World (OW) LCMV-Lassa virus complex and New World (NW), Tacaribe virus complex [3,4].",

Annually in Western Africa, there are several hundred thousand clinical LASV infections, and thousands of deaths due to LF [5,6,7,8]. Although LASV causes a significant number of deaths, the majority of infections are apparently subclinical, or not severe enough to warrant emergency medical intervention, as over 45% of the population in endemic regions is seropositive for LASV; however, why some of the population develop disease and others do not it is not well understood [9]. Most recently, a study of almost 200 LASV sequences has shown that reservoir-to-human transmission is a primary driving force of LASV epidemics in Western Africa [10]. LASV is carried by its natural host Mastomys natalensis, and it is widely accepted that transmission of LASV to humans likely occurs via the ingestion of contaminated food-stuffs, or by the inhalation of infectious particles [5]. Indeed, an epidemiological study in the Republic of Guinea showed a link between the consumption of contaminated food as a risk for rodent-to-human transmission [11].",

Currently, there are no clinically approved vaccines for LASV; and the antiviral drug ribavirin is the only treatment available for LASV infection. Nonetheless, caveats to this antiviral strategy/treatment regimen include severe side effects, and the requirement for early administration in order to have positive therapeutic effects [12]. Among limited vaccine candidates, only a LASV/Mopeia (MOPV) reassortant virus, ML-29, has been demonstrated to induce protective immunity against LASV strains from clade IV (Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Republic of Guinea) and clade II (Nigeria) [13,14,15,16,17,18,19]. Specifically, ML-29 is composed of the MOPV L segment, a non-pathogenic relative of LASV, and the S segment of LASV [20]. MOPV and ML-29 share the L RNA encoding L protein (RNA polymerase), and Z protein (matrix). Previous studies have determined that the L RNA segment of MOPV is the major factor of ML29 attenuation in vivo. Comparison of the ML-29 L segment with the parental MOPV L segment revealed the presence of numerous point mutations that may contribute to the attenuated phenotype associated with ML-29 [14]. While this reassortant has ML-29 specific mutations in the NP and GP2 proteins encoding by LASV S RNA, the attachment glycoprotein, GP1, is genetically identical to LASV.",

Like the epidemiological study from the Republic of Guinea, a natural route of infection was observed within zoo kept tamarin populations, as animals that consumed LCMV-infected mice succumbed to LF-like illness and disease [21,22].

As such, exposure of NHPs to LCMV-ARM through either intravenously (i.v.) or intragastrically (i.g.) routes produced deeply attenuated sub-clinical infection [23,24]. In contrast, LCMV-WE has limited passage history in mice and tissue culture models of infection, and induced fatal LF-like disease in i.g. and i.v. infected NHPs, providing a surrogate model of LF at biosafety level (BSL)-3 containment [23,24]. Notably, infections via mucosal (i.g.) inoculation were attenuated during interaction with, and/or crossing the mucosal barrier of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the intestinal epithelial are likely one of the natural gates of rodent-to-human transmission. Interestingly, when the LCMV-ARM or -WE i.g. infected NHPs were challenged with lethal doses of LCMV-WE intravenously, the animals did not succumb to LF-like disease as observed with PBS pretreated animals [24].",

The role of epithelial barriers on infection has been investigated extensively with a number of other viruses; however, the specific role of the intestinal epithelia on arenavirus infection remains to be exhaustively characterized [26,27,28,29]. Natural transmission via the intragastric route is generally considered to initiate with the interaction and infection of the epithelial cells from the apical side, whereas basolateral exposure of viruses requires damage, layer such as from a scratch or bite from an infected host, to the epithelial cell layer [30,31,32]. Here, we investigated the interaction of LCMV-Arm, LCMV-WE, Mopeia virus (MOPV), and the LASV/MOPV reassortant ML-29 with polarized Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells, to investigate the role of barrier systems in viral dissemination, and to further elucidate the interactions of OW mammarenaviruses with the gastrointestinal epithelial. Collectively, our current studies support the model that viral dissemination and interaction with epithelia may be host, tissue, and viral specific.",

LCMV-Arm (Figure 2A) and LCMV-WE (Figure 2B) exhibited similar replication kinetics regardless of the polarization state of the Caco-2 cells. It should be noted that at 24 h post infection LCMV-WE did show a slight difference in titer between the polarized and non-polarized Caco-2 cells, but these differences were not observed in further time points. As such, neither LCMV-Arm, nor LCMV-WE, infections were significantly impacted by the polarization of Caco-2 cells during apical infection (Figure 2). In addition, similar to LCMV, ML-29 was not significantly impacted by polarization of these cells (Figure 2C); however, peak viral titers were approximately 2-log lower than those for LCMV or MOPV (Figure 2D). Taken together these results indicate that polarization of Caco-2 has minimal, if any, inadvertent effect on replication kinetics of the OW arenaviruses.",

While LCMV-ARM is unique in its binding preference as compared to the other viruses, this indicates that LCMV-ARM, LCMV-WE, and MOPV all attach to some degree on the apical and basolateral surface of the cells. However, the ratio of basolateral and apical attachment of ML-29 indicates that there is a large difference between viral attachment between the two surfaces, with a significant preference for the apical side of the polarized Caco-2 cells (Figure 6E). ML-29\u2019s preference for the apical surface with comparatively little to no binding on the basolateral surface, is significantly different than that of LCMV and MOPV.

Up to 45% of individuals living in some LASV endemic regions in Western Africa can be seropositive to the virus; and if re-infection occurs, seropositive individuals can protect themselves from disease onset. However, seronegative individuals may also be protected from disease, due to protection associated with cell-mediated immunity [41]. This implies high prevalence into endemic populations; however, the precise mechanisms behind this phenomenon are unknown. In NHP studies of arenavirus disease, LCMV-WE causes LF-like disease via intravenous (i.v.)-infection, whereas LCMV-ARM shows chronic infection, with no disease onset [23]. Furthermore, high titer i.v. infections of NHPs with LCMV-WE resulted in uniform mortality [23]. Nevertheless, i.g. infection with identical titers showed a variable outcome, ranging from no signs and symptoms to fatal, LF-like disease with elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (ALT/AST) levels [23,24]. Elevated ALT and AST levels are symptomatic of hepatic tissue damage, and highly elevated levels are associated with lethal LF disease of humans in endemic regions [42]. In addition, some of the surviving animals survived i.v. challenge, indicating that LCMV infection did occur as a competent humoral response was induced [24]. Due to probable infection via the ingestion of contaminated food stuffs, and the variable outcomes of intragastric infection in vivo, we sought to investigate whether or not the patterns of entry and exit when polarized Caco-2 cells were exposed to OW mammarenaviruses apically (intragastric route) or basolaterally (intravenous route).",

ML-29 expresses GP1 attachment glycoprotein identical to LASV GP1, and MOPV, attenuated genetic relative of LASV. Since ML-29 is a reassortant virus of LASV/MOPV, it represents a better system in which arenaviral biology can be determined compared to VSV or retrovirus-based pseudotypes expressing LASV GPC as the viruses contain genuine arenaviral replication machinery.",

            "text": "From the in vivo studies in NHPs, it was expected for virus to release infectious particles from primarily the apical side, since viral particles were not detected in any tissues after intragastric infection with LCMV [23]. However, when exposed on the apical side of epithelial cells, LCMV and MOPV primarily released on the apical side of the cells, but release basolaterally was observed. This observation indicates that the epithelial barrier is not the sole determinant of viral dissemination. Interesting to note as well, was that patterns of replication were similar regardless of the in vivo pathogenicity of the LCMV strains. Therefore, the infectious capacity of these viruses in vitro, in regards to Caco-2 cells, does not correlate with pathogenic properties for LCMV. Therefore, further investigation as to the driving forces of pathogenic differences needs to be investigated. However, in contrast to LCMV, the ML-29 expressing LASV GP1, predominantly released viral particles apically regardless of the route of entry. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that MOPV entry-release pattern in polarized Caco-2 cells resembled those in cells infected with LCMV, and was clearly different from ML29-driving entry-release. Due to ML-29 replication patterns being different than that of MOPV replication, these patterns of entry and release are not due to MOPV replication machinery, and may be attributed to the gene products of the S segment of LASV, namely the glycoproteins and nucleoprotein. This poor replication and egress to the basolateral sides of the cells is an interesting observation. While ML-29 is not WT-LASV, using WT-LASV in similar studies could lead to an explanation as to why almost half of the population of endemic regions are seropositive for LASV, but never demonstrated clinical signs of disseminated illness. In addition, the data presented here indicates that the capacity to infect via the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells is not a primary determinant of arenavirus pathogenesis.",

As seen here, ML-29 had a much greater binding rate leading to successful infection when exposed to the apical side of polarized intestinal epithelia. If after successful attachment following the ingestion of viral particles fails to release viral particles basolaterally, this may be an exceptionally potent tool for the development of successful immunity against LASV in at-risk populations. These results provide additional evidence for attenuation of ML-29 as a vaccine strain for LASV. From these in vitro studies, and the dire need for a LASV vaccine, studies examining the importance of the route of exposure to ML-29 in an in vivo model should be investigated as a potential therapy to LASV infection and prevention.",

Here, rLCMV-LASGP showed preferential entry into polarized Caco-2 cells on the basolateral surface of these cells. Opposingly, we identified via qRT-PCR that viral attachment of ML-29, a reassortant containing the GP1 of LASV, preferred the apical surface of polarized Caco-2 cells. Interestingly, we did see LCMV preferentially attaching to the basolateral surface of polarized cells, as seen with rLCMV-LASVGP. However, the rLCMV-LASGP studies did not elucidate the viral release patterns of rLCMV-LASVGP in polarized Caco-2 cells, nor the initial attachment of viruses to these cell surfaces. Furthermore, due to ML-29\u2019s genetic differences to the LCMV-backbone of rLCMV-LASVGP, our results and those of Oppliger et al. cannot be directly compared. Taken together, our observations, are a useful addition to the field to further investigate precise differences between rLCMV-LASVGP and ML-29 in order to evaluate genetic variations of these viruses to more accurately identify potential targets for LASV therapeutics and further understand the replication cycle of LASV.",

Although primary receptor (\u03b1-DG) is located on the basolateral surface of the polarized Caco-2 cells, this data, along with the data of others, provides further support that LASV has complex receptor usage. Additional receptors for LASV should be investigated in the Caco-2 system, including Axl, DC-SIGN and Tyro3. Along with additional receptors and their role in our system, the interaction with \u03b1-DG should also be investigated. An excellent review by Torriani et al. describes a number of studies that explain the complex viral-receptor interaction of LASV [44]. Although fully functional \u03b1-DG was detected basolaterally in polarized Caco-2 cells, ML-29\u2019s binding efficiency was low. This may be due to a multitude of reasons including the use of other cellular factors and receptors used in addition to \u03b1-DG to attach to these polarized cells, or differences and mutations that ML-29 may contain as compared to WT LASV, especially those present in the GP2 protein. Previous research has identified that LASV infection was dependent upon sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), as well as actin cytoskeleton to have successful viral entry into host cells [45]. Investigations into these factors during infection of polarized Caco-2 cells should be analyzed to determine a reason for inefficient and poor binding of ML-29 on the basolateral side of these cells. Although ML-29 contains the S segment of LASV, the L segment of MOPV may interfere with complete and successful viral replication that WT LASV may have, comparatively. However, we believe the latter to be a minimal or insignificant inhibition of viral attachment and replication due to MOPV replicating similarly to LCMV in polarized Caco-2 cells when exposed to the basolateral side of the cells, as compared to little or no viral replication by ML-29 after basolateral exposure. Thus, investigation into precisely how WT LASV attaches, enters, and releases from polarized Caco-2 cells would be a valuable addition to the field.",

These polarized epithelia closely mimic intestinal epithelial of human hosts and allow further investigation of mammarenaviral infection at the epithelial barrier. These data with LCMV show that intestinal epithelial cells may not be the sole determinant of viral pathogenesis and dissemination. Furthermore, differences between prototypic arenavirus LCMV and the surrogate model of LASV interaction, ML-29, were observed in both attachment efficiency and viral entry and egress from polarized intestinal epithelia. These results may potentially explain the high penetrance without disease observed for LASV. In addition, ML-29\u2019s diminished binding efficiency to the basolateral side of polarized Caco-2 cells supports the expanding complexity of arenavirus receptor interactions. Collectively, these studies show that arenaviral infection of polarized cells is not only viral specific, but ultimately may be tissue and host-specific as well; and that arenavirus infection and pathogenesis may be dependent on asymmetric distribution of viral and cellular factors required for virus entry and budding.",
