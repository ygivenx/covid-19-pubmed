            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock. Outbreaks of FMD cause severe financial losses [1], and often lead to quarantining and export limitations in affected countries, as well as culling of herds. After a 2\u201312 day incubation period, affected animals develop acute onset of high fever, which is followed by vesicle formation in the mouth, pharynx and on the feet. Affected animals suffer pain, refuse their feed, and salivate extensively. The causal pathogen, FMDV, belongs to the genus Aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae and includes seven serotypes, A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3. The virion has a high potential for genetic and antigenic variation. Cross-protective antibodies are not formed after infection or vaccination by other serotypes and subtypes of FMDV. This has confounded the efforts of vaccination programs for preventing the disease [2]. The viral genome is a positive single-stranded RNA, with a protein coat consisting of four capsid proteins enumerated as VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. Currently available parenteral vaccines employed to control FMD are inactivated and contain the whole virus in a semi-purified state, especially the VP1 structural polypeptide, forming the virion as the immunological component, which shows the promising protection for animals against FMD [3].",

It holds Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) status. L. plantarum is a normal inhabitant of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in humans and mice, and recent genome-wide gene expression studies have identified adaptations that the bacteria use to survive in the harsh condition of the GI-tract [6\u20138]. It is considered a probiotic, and its high survival rate within GI-tract makes this bacterium a promising candidate for acceptability as a vehicle for in situ delivery of therapeutically interesting proteins [9\u201311]. Promising results have been achieved in inducing L. plantarum to secrete selected biomolecules, and by anchoring antigens to the cell [12,13]. Prior work has confirmed the potential of live recombinant Lactobacillus to deliver antigens to the immune system [4,14], suggesting the feasibility of using lactobacilli in effective oral vaccines.",

Although parenteral vaccination is usually efficient in inducing protective immune responses, the parenteral routes generally fail to activate mucosal immune responses and cannot effectively prevent the pathogens from entering the body via mucosae [15]. The creation of L. plantarum vaccines could result in halted virus transmission, and induce both mucosal immunity and systemic immunity. In this study, two recombinant L. plantarum strains\u2014NC8 and WCFS1\u2014were constructed to express a synthetic VP1 gene of FMDV A virus.

The cage measures 100cm\u00d760cm\u00d730cm and is suitable for 3 guinea pigs (total 30 guinea pigs in 10 cages). They were kept in a clean, quiet room with appropriate temperature, humidity and light. The health of the guinea pigs was monitored twice daily after FMDV challenge. All guinea pig experiments were performed in a bio-safety level 3 animal facilities of State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology following the protocol approved by Gansu Provincial Science and Technology Department. Experiments conformed to the local (Regulations for the administration of affairs concerning experimental animals) and international (Dolan K. 2007 Second Edition of Laboratory Animal Law. Blackwell, UK) guidelines on the ethical use of animals. Guinea pigs were anesthetized by exposure to 4% isoflurane for 3 minutes prior to blood collection, saliva collection and FMDV challenge. Guinea pigs meeting criteria for euthanasia (<25% weight loss compared to weight on day of challenge), were exposed to 5% isoflurane for 60 minutes rendering animals dead or completely non-responsive followed by cervical dislocation. All surviving guinea pigs were humanely euthanized at the end of this study.",

Seven days following the first immunization (day 10), anti-FMDV-VP1 IgA reached high levels in experimental groups, NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 (p<0.05), while there was no obvious increase of anti-FMDV-VP1 antibody in the control groups that received pSIP411 or milk (p>0.05). Similar results for anti-FMDV-VP1 sIgA antibody were obtained for fecal and salivary samples in the immunized guinea pigs (Fig 2(A) and 2(B)). After a second immunization (day 20), the concentration of serum IgA in the experimental groups, NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1, appeared lower than the original level after the first immunization (p<0.05). When compared to the mucosal IgA levels, no significant anti-FMDV-VP1 antibodies were observed in the control groups (p>0.05). The concentrations of anti-FMDV-VP1-specific IgM from immunized guinea pigs were also determined (Fig 2(E)) (p<0.05).

Vaccination is the main prophylactic method of preventing FMDV infection. Many types of vaccines have been designed\u2014almost entirely parenterally administered\u2014including inactivated antigen vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, DNA vaccines, empty capsid vaccines and synthetic peptide vaccines [21]. Inactivated virus vaccines can elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies and offer efficacious protection against homologous serotypes [22]. However, these vaccines have some shortcomings, including reversion to virulence, insufficient stability, and creation of viral carrier state. These vaccines cannot prevent the virus from entering the body via mucosa [15]. FMDV infection generally occurs at mucosal surfaces, which makes mucosal immunization with specific vaccine antigens an attractive option for protection against infection. Intranasal delivery of cationic PLGA nano/microparticles loaded with various FMDV DNA vaccine formulations encoding IL-6 as a molecular adjuvant enhanced protective immunity against infection by aerosolized FMDV [20]. Another study also suggested that intranasal delivery of Chi-PLGA-DNA nanoparticles with FMDV antigen resulted in high levels of mucosal, systemic and cell-mediated immunity and could reduce disease severity and virus excretion as well as delay clinical symptoms [23].",

Using lactobacilli as carriers to deliver exogenous vaccines antigens into the cytosol efficiently appears to be one of the most successful strategies [14,32]. WCFS1, the first genome annotated Lactobacillus strain, was found that it possessed the functionality of homologous signal peptides sequence [33]. NC8, isolated from grass silage, possessed unusual property of naturally plasmid free among L. plantarum strains [34]. These two L. plantarum can colonize the GI-tract, and are recognized as emerging candidates for the expression of recombinant proteins as well as for genetic and metabolic cell engineering [16], relevant to both medical and industrial biotechnology [35,36]. Oral administration of lactobacilli with recombinant proteins in situ has many advantages, such as safe, convenient, less stress among animals and reduction in adverse reaction [37,38]. Besides, lactobacilli as live vectors can persist longer in the GI-tract and some of them have intrinsic probiotic properties [39,40].",

            "text": "The gene used in this study, VP1 gene, has been the hot area of research in molecular biology of FMDV for years. VP1 protein exposed on the surface of viral particles is the main antigen of neutralizing antibody responses and plays an important part in forming the virus particles [41]. Over the past decades, the partial or complete VP1 coding sequence has been used in the development of engineering vaccines accommodating the large-scale production of recombinant protein, efficiently produced and expressed in various systems, such as E. coli, transgenic plants, yeasts, baculovirus and mammalian cells [19,42\u201346]. The sequence of VP1 gene was optimized based on the pool and codon used by L. plantarum, which reduced the GC content from 59.53% to 47.49% and without changing the gene expression, and improved the translational performance [47]. In this study, pSIP expression systems were used to express FMDV-VP1 protein. Studies are currently underway to employ lactic acid bacteria vectors to produce vaccines of many viral proteins, such as the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9N2 avian influenza virus, anti-rotavirus protein (Llama VHH antibody fragments), and bioactive porcine interferon-alpha [48\u201350]. Two L. plantarum strains were chosen in this study to carry the pSIP plasmids. Compared to the results of western blotting of these two strains, it was found that the molecular weight of target proteins expressed by WCFS1, was a little bigger than proteins expressed by NC8, on account of post-translational modification (such as phosphorylation and acetylation). Milk was used to resuspend strains in this study in order to improve taste for animals and make the oral administration safe and easy. In addition, we choose 37\u00b0C as induction temperature to imitate internal temperature of guinea pigs (the suitable temperature range of L. plantarum is 30\u201337\u00b0C).",

IgA antibody emerges when antigens invade mucosa, (earlier than IgG antibody), indicating that IgA functions at the early stage of viral infection. This current study demonstrated that high levels of FMDV-specific IgA were produced in serum, saliva and feces, supporting the importance of IgA antibody responses in preventing the entry and replication of FMDV. However, the full mechanisms underlying the decrease in respiratory tract infections and other symptoms are still uncertain. The production of IgG antibody occurred later that IgA, but levels became higher and lasted longer than IgA. Taken together, the results suggested that mucosal responses induced by recombinant L. plantarum were interactive with systemic responses.",

The data we obtained clearly demonstrated that oral administration of VP1 proteins expressed by NC8 and WCFS1 could induce both mucosal responses and systemic responses and provide good protection against FMDV challenge. The mucosal administration of the vaccine strains resulted in a detectable FMDV-specific IgG and IgA responses. However, because of frequent mutations in VP1 gene region of field isolates, VP1 protein based immunization cannot produce an effective and stable immune response over a long period of time. Researches are seeking alternative genes which are carrying effective immuno-dominant epitopes and with less mutation. For example, VP2 of FMDV is believed to carry immuno-dominant epitopes, and publications revealed that VP2 protein shows important immunological characteristics in the development of FMDV vaccines [51]. Those studies are still in preliminary stage, and further studies in our laboratory will explore immune effects of other FMDV gene segments in combination immunologic adjuvants (for instance, IFN) expressed by LAB via mucosal routes in different animal models, especially in large animals.",

Despite good application prospect of rLAB as therapeutic delivery vehicles, there are still many questions remaining unanswered, such as the dose of therapeutic protein delivered in situ by the rLAB after oral administration, the more effective immunization route (the intranasal route or the oral route), the best period of life (neonate or adult)[52]. This study is in the early stages of the FMD oral vaccines and needs more tests to enhance the immune effect. Further studies will be carried on larger animals which are susceptible to FMDV, such as swine and bovine, and the studies are required to consider immune effect comparison of the intranasal immunization and the oral immunization, the coexpression of larger fragments and cytokines. Many experts anticipate that, in the next decade, more applications of rLAB as therapeutic tools will be developed and optimized because LAB delivery is now a true realistic option in both human and animal medicine [13,53,54]. In conclusion, the oral live carrier vaccine is a promising strategy for the presentation of FMDV antigen to provide an effective, inexpensive and stable alternative to current approaches of immunization for FMDV [55].",
