Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the predominant etiological agent, but infections by other respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus (HRV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus, also occur. These infections with different respiratory virus present similar clinical characteristics, so etiological diagnosis can be carried out in clinical practice only by virus identification, either by molecular tests, immunofluorescence or culture methods [1\u20135]. Although the current guidelines do not indicate routine tests to identify the etiologic agent in infants with bronchiolitis, the etiological diagnosis may contribute to the prevention of nosocomial acquisition, since the transmission mechanisms diverge among respiratory viruses. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology also contributes to programming and organizing prophylactic strategies, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies to HRSV and influenza vaccination [3, 6]. Etiological diagnosis may also contribute for developing specific therapeutic approaches for each agent.",

HRSV is the main agent of bronchiolitis, responsible for high rates of hospitalization and it is a major cause of mortality, especially in premature infants and those with risk factors. Despite this fact, the therapeutic approach consists mainly in supportive measures [3]. HRV is the most common agent of cold and triggering asthma attacks in atopic individuals, however around 35% of asymptomatic subjects have positive results for HRV tests [8]. Serious infections by both agents in early life are associated with recurrent wheezing in the following years, but this association is stronger with HRV. While HRSV infection leads to structural and functional changes in the airways, HRV infections do not cause as many changes and are more related to atopy and asthma [9]. Clinical studies suggest that the use of corticosteroids during the acute phase of infection with high levels of HRV may reduce the risk of recurrent wheezing in the subsequent year [10, 11].",

Furthermore, PBMC transcriptome profiles can be used to assess disease severity in infants with HRSV [7] and to predict individualized responses to HRV [14]. Thus, besides contributing to clarify the etiology, genomic methods can bring important information on the pathogenic role of the different respiratory virus as single agents, or in codetection, and in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is especially important in HRV infections.",

Moreover, the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory T-cell cytokine responses may determine the clinical outcome of HRSV infection. High levels of IFN-gamma might reduce viral replication but increase immunopathology. However, decreased IFN-gamma response has been reported to be associated with severe HRSV infection [27]. The treatment with systemic steroids is controversial regarding the efficacy of systemic steroid use in severe bronchiolitis. Pinto et al [28] showed that infants with severe illness had higher plasma cortisol levels than infants with mild disease, and a decreased IFN-gamma production by PBMCs in severely affected infants.

IDO1 was hyper-expressed after IFN-mediated induction in response to Influenza A viruses and this enzyme is involved in cytokine overproduction and T cell suppression [38]; v) CBL, alias C-CBL, encodes for RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase and it is involved in antiviral process by activation IFN-I pathway [39]; and vi) PACS2, that codifies for a sorting protein PACS-2, interacts with a protein Nef of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [40]. This interaction mediates the MHC-I down-regulation and consequently the virus escape from host immunity [40].",

Additionally, the infants with HRSV had leukopenia and they usually demand more hospitalization days. The immune response to HRSV infection, comparatively to the response to HRV infection, appears to be more associated to the activation of the IFN\u03b3 signaling pathways and less related to neutrophil activation. Moreover, we also identified potential host-response molecular markers that could be used for HRSV or HRV etiopathogenic diagnosis. These results may contribute to the development of future tests for respiratory virus identification. Additionally, a better understanding of PBMC specific host responses to HRSV or HRV\u2014here disclosed by different gene expression profiles\u2014may serve to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by different viral agents and, therefore, contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches.",
