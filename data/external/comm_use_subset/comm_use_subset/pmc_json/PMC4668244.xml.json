            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious and devastating viral enteric disease characterized by vomiting, acute onset of severe watery diarrhea, and dehydration. PED has a high infectivity and a particularly significant mortality in piglets (Pensaert and de Bouck 1978). The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, is responsible for PED. The PEDV genome is approximately 28 Kb in length and is composed of seven open reading frames (ORF) that encode four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), and three major non-structural proteins, including replicases 1a and 1b, and ORF3 (Song and Park 2012). Of the structural protein, the PEDV S protein plays a pivotal role in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptors to mediate viral attachment and entry. Moreover, the S protein is associated with the induction of host neutralizing antibodies, growth adaptation in vitro, and attenuation of virulence in vivo (Song and Park 2012). Thus, study of the S glycoprotein has been essential in understanding the genetic relationships between PEDV strains, the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field, and the development of vaccines (Song and Park 2012; Chen et al. 2012); (Temeeyasen et al. 2014).",

ORF3 gene plays a role in encoding an ion channel protein (Wang et al. 2012) and it has been suggested to be an important determinant for virulence of this virus (Song and Park 2012). The virulence of PED can be reduced by altering the ORF3 gene through cell culture adaptation (Park et al. 2008), and variation in ORF3 was reported to be associated with viral attenuation in the natural host (Song et al. 2003). Also, vaccine-derived isolates with unique continuous deletions of 49 and 51 ORF3 nucleotides have been confirmed (Chen et al. 2010; Park et al. 2008). Therefore, these unique deletions in the ORF3 gene can be used to differentiate between field and attenuated vaccine strains. Moreover, ORF3 gene variation may represent a useful tool in molecular epidemiological studies of PEDV (Park et al. 2008, 2011; Song et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2010).",

Afterwards, there have been sporadic PED outbreaks in intervals of several years. Since late 2013, numerous diarrhea epidemics, suspected to be caused by PED, have occurred in pigs throughout Japan. These epidemics were characterized by severe diarrhea, dehydration, and vomiting in pigs of all ages. Mortality rates were particularly high among suckling pigs. Up to the end of August 2014, more than 410,000 of 1,286,000 pigs from 817 infected farms have died of PED in Japan based from the report of Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) (http://www.maff.go.jp). However, there have been few studies investigating the re-emergence of PEDV in Japan. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic characteristics and molecular epidemiology of the emergent Japanese PEDV isolates using genome analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the partial S gene and ORF3.",

The deletions in P5-V lead to a reading frame-shift and TAG terminator at 276nt while that of 96P4C6 resulted in a TGA terminator at 342nt. Thus, ORF3 of P5-V and 96P4C6 encoded truncated proteins of 91 and 143 amino acid, respectively. Twenty-one PEDV isolates collected from recent outbreaks in 5 prefectures (Miyazaki, Kagoshima, Aichi, Aomori, and Hokkaido) were found to have identical ORF3 gene sequence (represented by isolate 14JM-01).

As a result, the genetic characteristics and origins of prevailing PEDVs in Japan, the efficacy of PEDV vaccines being used in Japan in protecting previously well pigs from prevailing PEDVs, and the genetic differences between vaccine strains and field PEDV isolates remain critically important questions that have yet to be fully elucidated.

Our study revealed that the ORF3 gene of the Japanese vaccine strains, P5-V and 96P4C6, have unique deletions (49 and 4nt, respectively) that can lead to reading frame-shift and coding of truncated polypeptides. This genetic characteristic can be used to differentiate between field and attenuated-derived vaccine PEDV. Moreover, the finding of 49nt deletion in ORF3 gene of P5-V in this study is different from the result of a previous study (Park et al. 2008) in which authors reported that P5-V have 51nt deletion in ORF3 gene. This difference may be due to the genetic variation of P5-V during the time of the study. The results of the present study demonstrated that no deletion were observed in the Japanese field isolates, suggesting that they are not vaccine-related.

Exactly, 4 \u00b5L of RNA template was mixed with a reaction mixture, which contained 12.5 \u00b5L of AccessQuickTM Master Mix (2\u00d7), 0.5 \u00b5L of each specific primer (10 \u00b5M), and 0.5 \u00b5L of AMV reverse transcriptase (5 u/\u00b5L). Then, 7 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water was added to reach the total volume reaction of 25 \u00b5L. The RT-PCR reaction were done using Takara PCR Thermal cycler (Japan). Following a reverse transcription step of 45 \u00b0C for 45 min and an incubation step of 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, 35 cycles were performed as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 53 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min. Cycles were followed by a terminal 10 min extension step at 72 \u00b0C. The last stage was preserving the PCR products at 4 \u00b0C. The RT-PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in a 1.5 % agarose gel containing Ethidium Bromide.",

The predicted size of the ORF3 PCR product was 740 bp. For the application of the partial S gene and the ORF3 gene of PEDV, RT was first performed using random primers and OligodT primers from Reverse Transcription System Kits (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Complimentary DNA was immediately used to amplify the partial S gene (primer pair P1/P2) and ORF3 gene (primer pair ORF3-F/ORF3/R) using GoTaq\u00ae Green Master Mix Kits (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) under the following condition: denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 53 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 1 min.
