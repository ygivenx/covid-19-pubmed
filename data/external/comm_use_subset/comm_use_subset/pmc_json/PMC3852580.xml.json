            "text": "Allergic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by allergic skin inflammation. Among the various types of AD, contact dermatitis is induced by an allergic response to a multitude of chemical substances associated with environmental contamination. Dysregulated type 1 helper T cell (Th1) and Th2 responses are pathogenic in allergic dermatitis via Th2 production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 [1, 2]. Th2 cytokines promote mast cell development. Mast cells are key effectors in immunoglobulin (Ig) E-associated Th2-type immune responses because they are activated by cross linking of Fc\u03b5RI. Allergen-provoked mast cells trigger release of allergic inflammatory mediators including histamine via degranulation [3]. IFN-\u03b3 suppresses IgE production by B cells, as well as IL-4 production from Th2 cells [4]. Therefore, the development of dermatitis is thought to be caused primarily by overproduction of Th2-mediated cytokines [5, 6].",

We identified 4 food-derived extracts with high anti-allergenic potential, including black pepper (Piper nigrum), green tea (Camellia sinensis), turmeric (Curcuma longa), and fermented soybean paste (cheonggukjang), as well as herb-derived extracts of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis), hawkweed (Hieracium albiflorum), beefsteak plant (Perilla frutescens), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), and skullcap (Scutellariae baicalensis) (Table 1). Their curative properties have been demonstrated in many studies. Licorice, hawkweed, and skullcap suppress inflammation by regulating immune function in antigen-activated macrophages [10\u201312]. Beefsteak plant and green tea inhibit mast cell activation by suppressing histamine release and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production [13\u201315]. Fenugreek, black pepper, and fermented soybean paste extracts and major constituents may serve as immunoregulatory mediators [16\u201319]. Turmeric produces an immunomodulatory response by stimulating dendritic cell function [20].",

The TMA-induced response increased production of Th2 cytokines and immune cell infiltration, such as by mast cells [21]. The severity of inflammation can be assessed using ear thickness [22]. In all but the na\u00efve group, 5% TMA challenge on days 0 and 5 and subsequent daily low-dose challenges with 2% TMA for 10 days induced a significant increase in ear thickness; this increase was inhibited by prednisolone (30 mg/kg BW), which served as the positive control [18]. Daily NPM-9 gavage (250 mg/kg BW) also produced an incremental decline in ear thickness (Figure 2(b)). We also measured epidermal thickness, infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes, and the number of mast cells in the dermis of the ears and found that NPM-9 inhibited the effects of TMA (data not shown). We also observed the body weight of each mouse in days 5~20 on Th2-mediated skin allergic inflammation to examine toxicity or side effect of NPM-9. As a result, body weight of NPM-9 group did not differ from that of sham or prednisolone group (data not shown).",

Oral administration of NPM-9 reduced the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 in inflamed ear tissue but not IL-4 (Figure 3(b)). In splenocytes, NPM-9 reduced IL-4 and IL-1\u03b2 without cytotoxicity (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). It is possible that NPM-9 had not yet induced Th2 migration to the inflamed regions but was sufficiently potent to downregulate Th2 in splenocytes. These results show that oral administration of NPM-9 constricted TMA-induced dermal inflammation; the biological basis of this inhibition appears to involve the balance of Th2 cells in the immune system. It is also important to demonstrate IFN-\u03b3 production in skin inflammation. There are distinct types of TMA-induced skin inflammation mouse models: acute TMA-induced CHS in Balb/c mice with subacute and chronic models of TMA-induced ear inflammation. In comparison to the acute model, the chronic TMA-induced CHS model exhibits a mixed type 1 and 2 T-cell differentiation and activation pattern [21]; however, the TMA-induced CHS mouse model used in this study is acute or subacute, characterized by eosinophil and T-cell infiltration, Th2 cytokine production, and IgE expression [21]. Moreover, oral administration of NPM-9 suppressed early-phase Th2 skewing, prohibiting the development of chronic inflammation. Therefore, we examined the Th2-dependent immune responses (IgE and IL-4) and proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 as indicators of Th2-mediated skin inflammation; however, the effect of NPM-9 on IFN-\u03b3 production in both Th1-s and Th2-dependent chronic skin inflammation requires further study.

IC50 values were calculated and compared as illustrated in Table 3. IL-4 production was inhibited by fenugreek > black pepper > chonggugjang > licorice > green tea > skullcap > turmeric > hawkweed > beefsteak plant. Each extract produced an antiallergic effect by inhibiting IL-4 production; food extracts were more effective than herb extracts. Splenocytes cultured with NPM-9 produced IL-4 levels 1.6- to 16-fold lower than that with each extract alone (Table 3). The IC50 ratio of IL-4 versus IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of NPM-9 was 1.6- to 48-fold higher than that with each extract alone. These results indicate that NPM-9 exerts potent synergistic suppression of the allergic response by inhibiting IL-4 secretion and inducing IFN-\u03b3 secretion.",

IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 levels were greater in the splenocytes of NPM-9-treated OVA-stimulated mice than in untreated mice. IL-4 was suppressed in the splenocytes of NPM-9-treated versus the untreated OVA-stimulated group. However, IL-10 secretion was not enhanced by NPM-9 treatment (Figures 4(c)\u20134(f)). The effect of NPM-9 on IL-12 and IL-10 is interesting in the context of macrophages. IL-12, a product of activated macrophages, induces the Th1 cytokine pattern [25], and IL-10 inhibits macrophage-dependent cytokine synthesis by Th1 cells [26]. That is, Th1 cells can be inhibited by IL-10 but induced by IL-12 through the regulation of macrophages. Consistent with this model, we speculated that NPM-9 suppression of Th2-mediated allergic responses such as skin inflammation may occur through the induction of Th1 via macrophages. ",

Many studies have reported that flavonoids such as curcumin or catechin have immunomodulatory activities. Glycyrrhizin enhances LPS-induced IL-12 production by peritoneal macrophages independent of IFN-\u03b3 and GM-CSF [33]. Saponin and poly \u03b3-glutamic acid have immunostimulatory effects on the immune function of lymphocytes or the immune responses to vaccine immunizations [14, 34, 35]. Oral administration of NPM-9 (250 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks had no adverse effects in mice, demonstrating that NPM-9 is safe even at high concentrations. The safety and immunomodulatory effects of NPM-9 may result from the interaction of active ingredient in each extract.

NPM-9 inhibits the polarized Th2 response through Th1 skewing that is dependent on IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 secretion in an OVA-induced Th2 allergic state. Our results provide scientific proof of the prevention and treatment of skin allergic inflammation by the synergistically inhibitory effects of food and herb extracts on Th2-polarized allergic responses.
