A lot of pathogens can cause ARIs, and viruses have been considered as the main pathogens in people [3]. The major viral agents of ARIs include influenza viruses A and B (IAV,IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para-influenza viruses (PIVs), adenovirus (ADV) and human rhinovirus (HRV). In the past decade, several new viruses associated with ARIs such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV) [4] have been discovered in human respiratory tract specimens.",

Due to the different age groups, climate and other factors, the infection incidence, seasonality, co-infection rate and clinical profiles of respiratory virus in hospitalized ARIs are different. In this study, a total of 607 hospitalized ARI cases were enrolled from 2011 to 2013, and 35.75 % were positive for at lease one virus, which was consistent with the previous study in China (36.6 %) [10]. The finding also illustrated that the virus positive rate was double in children less than 5 years than that in adults. At the same time, children less than 5 years old accounted for most cases of ARIs (44.15 %) and 45.52 % of them had a documented viral infection (Table 1), a similar incidence rate has been obtained in Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Rome and Milan [13\u201316], but it was different from other studies [17, 18]. For the old adult (\u226560 years), viruses were detected in 22.31 % (29/130) of samples, which was lower than that of the study reported by Ren L [12] and Raquel Cirlene da Silva [19].",

For the young children less than 5 years, the positive rate was three times than that in old adults (15.63 % VS 4.62 %). The influenza virus A(H1N1) pdm09 and dynamic change of influenza viruses could explain this shift. As an emergence infectious disease, people could be vulnerable to infection with influenza virus A (H1N1) pdm09 because of low antibody in the second wave in 2010\u20132011 surveillance season [20]. The influenza surveillance data also verified that influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 was the main strain in Shandong in 2011 and 2013 [21]. After that in 2011, IVB became the predominant strain in 2012 due to the limited immunological cross-reactivity between influenza subtypes which lead to the increase of the infection population [20, 21]. Our study also highlighted a clear seasonal distribution of influenza viruses which were active in winter and IVA was detected in the four seasons.",
