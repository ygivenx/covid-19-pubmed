            "text": "Artificial abzymes (catalytic Abs against transition state analogues of chemical reactions) and natural abzymes are novel biological catalysts that have attracted a lot of interest in recent years (reviewed in [1]\u2013[5]). Artificial abzymes are abzymes against analogs of transition states of catalytic reactions [1]\u2013[5] or antiidiotypic Abs induced by a primary antigen, which may show some of their features including the catalytic activity (for review also see [6]\u2013[11]). During the past two decades it has become clear that auto-antibodies (auto-Abs) from sera of patients with different autoimmune diseases can possess enzymatic activities and that their occurrence is a distinctive feature of autoimmune diseases (reviewed in [11]\u2013[14]). Different abzymes may play a significant role in forming specific pathogenic patterns and clinical settings in different autoimmune conditions through their broadened auto-Ab properties. Patients with autoimmune diseases produce Abs to nucleoprotein complexes, DNA and enzymes that participate in nucleic acid metabolism [11]\u2013[14]. In autoimmune diseases, there can be a spontaneous induction of anti-idiotypic antibodies, which are Abs elicited by a primary antigen, including some with catalytic activity, or a transition from polyreactive catalytic activity to an autoantigen-directed activity. Natural abzymes hydrolyzing DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, oligopeptides, and proteins are present in the serum of patients with several autoimmune and viral diseases (reviewed in [11]\u2013[14]). Healthy humans do not develop abzymes with detectable DNase and RNase activities, their levels being usually on the borderline of sensitivity of the detection methods [11]\u2013[14].",

Its etiology remains unclear, and the most valid theory of its pathogenesis assigns the main role in the destruction of the myelin-proteolipid shell of axons to inflammation related to autoimmune reactions ([15], and refs therein). Although the T-cell immune system plays a leading role in MS pathogenesis, the normal functioning of the B-cell system is also important for the development of the disease. An enhanced synthesis of immunoglobulins (usually IgGs), their free light chains and of a polyspecific DNA binding Abs interacting with phospholipids can be observed in MS patients [15].",

In addition, it was shown that MS IgGs containing lambda (\u03bb-IgGs) and kappa (\u03ba-IgGs) light chains as well as IgGs of all four subclasses (IgG1-IgG4) efficiently hydrolyze MBP [20]. Recognition and degradation of MBP peptides by serum auto-Abs were confirmed as a novel biomarker for MS [22]. The established MS drug Copaxone appears to be a specific inhibitor of MBP-hydrolyzing abzyme activity [22]. Taking these observations into account, the analysis of relative concentrations of proteins and MBP-hydrolyzing abzymes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients is of special interest.",

Then, electrophoretically homogeneous csf-IgGmix was used. To prove that MBP-hydrolyzing activity of csf-IgGmix is an intrinsic property of MS Abs, we have applied several of known rigid criteria [11]\u2013[14], [31]. The most important of these criteria are given below: a) electrophoretic homogeneity of csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix (Fig. 4A); b) FPLC gel-filtration of csf-IgGmix under conditions of \u201cacidic shock\u201d (pH 2.6) did not lead to a disappearance of the activity, and the peak of proteolytic activity tracked exactly with 150 kDa IgGs (the proteolytic activity is absent in zones corresponding to molecular masses, 20\u201328 kDa, of known canonical proteases) (Fig. 4B); c) complete adsorption of the MBP-hydrolyzing activity by anti-IgG Sepharose leading to a disappearance of the catalytic activity from the solution and its elution from the adsorbent with buffer of acidic pH (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained for ser-IgGmix. It was shown previously, that IgG from sera of healthy donors cannot hydrolyze MBP [17]\u2013[22]. Csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix corresponding to seven healthy donors analyzed in this article were also catalytically inactive after FPLC gel-filtration of Absmix under conditions of \u201cacidic shock\u201d and affinity chromatography on anti-IgG Sepharose.",

It is known that canonical proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, chymotrypsinogen etc) are enzymes of relatively low molecular masses, which are relatively easy to significant restore their enzymatic activity after their treatment with SDS. Since SDS dissociates any protein complexes, and the electrophoretic mobility of the usually low molecular mass proteases (\u223c20\u201330 kDa) cannot coincide with that of intact IgGs (or Ab complexes with proteases), the detection of proteolytic activity in the gel region corresponding only to intact IgGs from CSFs and sera, provides direct evidence that CSF and serum IgGs do not contain admixtures of canonical proteases and possess MBP-hydrolyzing activity. In addition, csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix corresponding to seven healthy donors were also inactive after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (for, example Fig. 4D).",

Similar situation was observed in the case of abzymes against other proteins and peptides: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and integrase, human serum albumin, casein, thyroglobulin, and intestinal vasoactive peptide [31]\u2013[35]. However, IgG pools from the sera of patients with SLE and HIV-infected patients before their separation on sorbents bearing immobilized specific proteins can contain small fractions of abzymes hydrolyzing several various proteins including human serum albumin, casein, HIV reverse transcriptase and integrase [32]\u2013[34]. Therefore, we could not exclude, that IgGs from CSFs and sera of some MS patients can contain small fractions of enzymes specifically hydrolyzing human serum albumin, casein, thyroglobulin, or some other proteins. At the same time, we did not find in the sera of various patients with autoimmune diseases abzymes hydrolyzing several other control proteins: hen egg lysozyme, human milk lactalbumin and lactoferrin [32]\u2013[34]. Therefore, these three proteins, easily cleavable by canonical proteases, were used for analysis of csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix substrate specificity. Fig. 5A shows, that csf-IgGmix efficiently cleave MBP, but cannot in the same conditions remarkably hydrolyze these three control proteins. Similar result was obtained for ser-IgGmix (Fig. 5B). It is known, that classical mammalian, bacterial, and viral proteases are mostly unspecific and capable to hydrolyze any proteins or specific to bacterial and viral proteins. In contrast to canonical proteases, MS IgGs specifically hydrolyzed only MBP, but not other control tested proteins These data also indicate that IgG preparations from CSFs and sera do not contain impurities of classical human, bacterial, or viral proteases.",

            "text": "It is known that due to alternative splicing of cDNA, animal and human MBP can consist of several related forms of different molecular masses (21.5, 18.5, 17.5, and 14.0 kDa) [36]. In addition, MBP may partially be hydrolyzed in human cells and during protein purification [37]. Therefore, highly purified preparations of MBP are usually not homogeneous and according to SDS-PAGE they can contain several protein bands, of which \u223c18.5 kDa is usually major [37]. In this study we have used 18.5 kDa MBP containing no remarkable amounts of other forms of the protein. First, the relative activity of CSF Abs in the MBP cleavage was calculated from the decrease in the intensity of Coomassie-stained \u223c18.5 kDa MBP band after electrophoresis as in [17]\u2013[19]; the difference in the intensities of the protein, incubated in the absence and in the presence of Abs, was used for our calculations. To quantitatively estimate the protease activity, we have found a low concentration for each IgG preparation corresponding to the reaction of the first order, where the major \u223c18.5 kDa MBP fraction is converted into products during hydrolysis within the linear regions of IgG concentration (for example, Fig. 6C demonstrates data for csf-IgGmix) and the time courses (15\u201340% of conversion; for example, Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 6). IgGs from CSFs demonstrated high activity and we used low concentration of these Abs (0.005\u20130.03 mg/ml) and 2\u20135 h of incubation. Csf-IgGmix and ser-IgGmix (0.1 mg/ml corresponding to seven healthy donors were completely inactive in the hydrolysis of MBP (for example, Fig. 4D and 6B). Among 15 individual MS patients, the RAs of IgGs from CSFs at a fixed concentration of MBP (0.5 mg/ml) were very different (the specific RAs varied in a range 3.5\u2013368 nmole MBP per hour per mg of Abs, while apparent kcat = V/[IgG] in the range 0.009\u20130.93 min\u22121); the average RA values were 175.0\u00b194.5 nM MBP per hour per mg of Abs (average apparent kcat 0.4\u00b10.26 min\u22121) (Table 3). The RAs of IgGs from sera were significantly lower and IgGs were used in higher concentrations (0.1\u20130.3 mg/ml), dependently of the preparation, the reaction mixtures were incubated for 8\u201320 h. The specific RAs of the sera IgGs varied in a range 0.21\u20137.5 nmole MBP per hour per mg of Abs and apparent kcat in the range (0.051\u20131.8 min\u22121)\u00d710\u22122 min\u22121; the average values of RAs were 3.0\u00b11.7 nM MBP per hour per mg of Abs (average apparent kcat (7.4\u00b14.8)\u00d710\u22123 min\u22121) (Table 3).",

Since the specific activity was calculated using the total concentration of IgGs, the specific protease activities of the individual monoclonal subfractions in a polyclonal IgG pool may be significantly higher than those of the non-fractionated IgGs. In addition, the repertoire of polyclonal Abs against different antigens in the case of sera from MS patients may be significantly wider than that of CSFs. It may be one of the possible reasons of a lower specific activity of serum IgGs.",

It has recently been shown that the specific reorganization of the immune system during spontaneous development of a profound SLE-like pathology in MRL-lpr/lpr mice is associated with changes in the differentiation profile and the level of proliferation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and with the production of DNase, ATPase, and amylase abzymes [39]\u2013[41]. Immunization of healthy mice with DNA also leads to a production of Abs with DNase activity; however, it is only associated with increased lymphocyte proliferation and suppression of apoptosis of lymphocytes in different organs (especially in the spleen), but not with a change in the differentiation of bone marrow cells [39]\u2013[41]. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that B-cells of CSF of MS patients can produce not only Abs interacting with MBP, but also specific anti-MBP abzymes with high proteolytic activity. Abzymes produced by lymphocytes against MBP in different organs of MS patients (and circulating in the blood system) may have a lower MBP-hydrolyzing activity in comparison with anti-MBP Abs of CSF, or there may be different ratio of abzymes and anti-MBP Abs without catalytic activity in the CSFs and sera of MS patients.",

            "text": "The absence of a definite dependence between titers of anti-DNA and anti-MBP Abs and these parameters with standard clinical indices may be caused by several reasons. MS is an extremely multifactorial disease, in which similar pathomorphological and clinical indices manifested as MS may result from very different underlying processes and conditions [42], [43]. For example, in each MS patient, the \u201crelative stability\u201d of different organs and their functions to the destructive effect of transient immune system errors can be significantly different depending on the genetic background and environmental stress factors, including geographic ones [42]\u2013[44]. Some proteins of influenza, herpes, polyoma, Epstein\u2013Barr and other viruses and of some bacteria have been reported to mimic human myelin proteins, and these infections can therefore lead to immunization with their proteins and stimulate the subsequent formation of Abs to myelin and finally to the development of autoimmune reactions [45]\u2013[48]. In individual MS patients, the development of autoimmune reactions can be stimulated by different viral or bacterial infections as well as various toxic chemicals. Furthermore, it should also be taken into account that MS is a pathology of at least two phases [48]. The cascade of reactions corresponding to the first inflammatory phase is very complicated and involves many proteins, enzymes, cytokines, and chemokines inducing macrophages and other cells producing NO\u2022 radicals and osteopathin [43], [48]. The complex and coordinated action of T- and B-cells, complement system, inflammation mediators and auto-Abs result in the formation of demyelinization nodi and the interruption of axon conductivity. The neurodegenerative phase of MS that ensues thereafter is directly connected to the neural tissue destruction in these patients [43], [48]. Therefore, any analysis of biochemical, immunological and clinical indices must take into account the current stage of the disease. Obviously, quite different characteristics of pathologic processes can be obtained in individual patients as the disease progresses against the background of the continually changing immunoregulation, including the exhaustion of different compensatory and adaptive mechanisms and systemic metabolic changes. This makes the clinical course of MS hardly predictable in individual patients [43], [48]. Therefore, it is not surprising that we could not find a statistically significant correlation of titers of Abs to MBP and RAs of abzymes with all parameters measured, since each patient can be characterized by an individual combination of genetic, environmental, chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating, neurodegenerative and/or other factors.",
