These domains are separated by a flexible 20 amino acid linker [3], [4]. The dsRBM recognizes dsRNA with no sequence specificity via minor groove interactions [5], [6], while the kinase domain helps mediate dimerization of PKR as well as possessing the kinase catalytic activity [7]\u2013[9].",

RNA species of this length are long enough to accommodate a PKR dimer [10]\u2013[12]. Two models of RNA-mediated activation of PKR have been offered: 1) a model in which PKR has intrinsically disordered regions that become ordered upon RNA binding, and 2) an autoinhibition model in which the latent protein is locked into a closed conformation that is relieved upon binding to dsRNA of sufficient length [3], [13]. Activated PKR then phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, inhibiting translation initiation [14]. This overall process provides essential antiviral and antiproliferative functions for the infected host cell [15].",

For instance, certain highly structured single-stranded viral and cellular RNAs with bulges, imperfect loops, pseudoknots, and single stranded tails can activate PKR [24]\u2013[26]. In addition, largely single-stranded RNA can activate PKR in a 5\u2032-triphosphate dependent manner, which may help distinguish self and non-self RNAs [27]\u2013[29], and this activation can be abrogated by incorporating nucleoside modifications into the transcripts [30], [31]. Several examples of non-canonical RNA activators of PKR include: HIV TAR and HDV RNA dimers [10], [11], domain II and domain III\u2013IV of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of HCV [32], [33], the 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) of several highly structured cytoskeletal mRNAs [34],[35], the 5\u2032-UTR of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA [24], [25], and mutant transcripts of the Huntington\u2019s and myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) genes [18], [36], [37]. These non-canonical RNA activators provide an activating length of 33 bp by either dimerization of the RNA [10], [11], which roughly doubles the length of a given RNA species, or by non-Watson-Crick interactions in the loops of the RNA [1], [25]. In addition, siRNA containing just 19\u201321 bp can activate PKR, possibly by forming extended RNA species [1], [38], [39].",

In the present study, we evaluate PKR activation by incorporating nucleoside modifications into biologically relevant tRNA transcripts, as well as endogenous tRNAs from various organisms. In the cytoplasm of the cell, tRNAs are the most heavily modified RNAs, with approximately 20% of its nucleosides being modified [51].

At first we compared activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of PKR by the T7 transcript of tRNAPhe and the natively isolated tRNAPhe (Fig. 1B, row 1, compare the two lane sets). (In an innate immune response, PKR autophosphorylates, which allows it to phosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 which inhibits translation initiation.) The T7 transcript contains a 5\u2032-triphosphate and unmodified bases, whereas the native tRNA has a 5\u2032-monophosphate and modified bases. The T7 transcript activated PKR to almost the same levels as the perfectly double stranded, dsRNA-79, whereas native tRNAPhe did not activate PKR above background at any of the RNA concentrations tested (Fig. 1B). The abrogation of PKR activation by native tRNAPhe may be due to the internal modifications or to lack of a 5\u2032-triphosphate, given that some RNAs require a 5\u2032-triphosphate to activate PKR [27]. To test the role of the 5\u2032-triphosphate, we tested PKR activation by calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP)-treated T7-tRNAPhe. Activation of PKR was completely retained by CIP-treated T7-tRNAPhe (Fig. 1B, row 2, compare \u20185\u2032-ppp\u2019 and \u20185\u2032-OH\u2019 lanes), indicating that the 5\u2032-triphosphate is not a factor for PKR activation by T7-tRNAPhe. The unimportance of a 5\u2032-triphosphate for tRNA-PKR function is similar to that found for dsRNA and PKR [27]. Overall, these findings suggest that nucleoside modifications may play a key role in abrogating PKR activation by native tRNAPhe.",

            "text": "In order to better understand the role of nucleoside modifications in native tRNA-PKR interactions, we tested PKR activation by a series of modified T7-tRNAPhe transcripts. We fully substituted uridines in tRNAPhe with either 2-thiouridine (s2U) or pseudouridine (\u03c8); cytidine with either 5-methylcytidine (m5C), 2\u2032-O-methylcytidine (Cm), or 2\u2032-fluorocytidine (2\u2032-FC); and adenosine with N1-methyladenosine (m1A) (Fig. 1B). These modified nucleosides are commercially available as triphosphates, which are amenable for use in in vitro transcription. Transfer RNAs containing the majority of these modifications (s2U, \u03c8, m5C, Cm, and m1A) revealed significant reduction in PKR activation, the exception being 2\u2032-FC, which showed an enhancement in PKR activation. These results indicate that modifications generally abrogate activation of PKR by tRNA, just as observed previously in model RNAs [30]. Moreover, retention of PKR activation by tRNAs containing 2\u2032-FC, which can accept a hydrogen bond, supports the importance of minor groove hydrogen bonding between the dsRBD and tRNA, as previously reported in unmodified dsRNAs [5], [6]. In considering these data, it is important to keep in mind that full substitution of a natural base with a modified one will affect the folding of the tRNA; as such, changes in PKR activation will be due to a combination of direct effects of the modification and indirect effects of the RNA folding. Overall, these findings suggest that tRNA has the potential to activate PKR and thus lead to an innate immune response.",

            "text": "The level of modification in tRNA varies depending on the origin of the tRNA. For example, cytoplasmic tRNAs are heavily modified (\u223c14 sites/tRNA), whereas mitochondrial tRNAs generally contain relatively few modifications (\u223c3 sites/tRNA) and have less variety in the modifications observed [53]. In particular, tRNAs from E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, and wheat contain many modifications as compared to mitochondrial bovine liver tRNAs [54]. To further test our observation that nucleoside modifications in tRNA influence PKR activation, we tested PKR activation by total tRNAs from different organisms, including E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, wheat and bovine liver mitochondria. All of these tRNAs are available commercially except for mitochondrial tRNA, which was isolated using published procedures [55]. As shown in Figure 2A, total mitochondrial bovine liver tRNA significantly activated PKR, while total tRNAs from other organisms did not. For example, at a 1.25 \u00b5M concentration, tRNAs from E. coli, bovine liver, yeast and wheat showed lower activation of PKR by \u223c22-, 7-, >25- and 7-fold, respectively, as compared to mitochondrial tRNA. These observations strongly suggest that nucleoside modifications in these tRNAs play a major role in the abrogation of PKR activation, either directly or through their effects on tRNA structure.",

Remarkably, both of these tRNAs potently activated PKR, having activation profiles similar to each other and to the total mt bovine liver preparation, although there was somewhat less activation by the native mt-tRNA, perhaps reflecting a slight suppression of activation by its few modifications (Fig. 2B). Because in vitro transcribed T7-mt-tRNAMet has no modifications and native mt-tRNAMet has very few, we believe that the ability of these tRNAs to activate PKR resides in the little or no modification present in them. This interpretation supports the notion that modifications in cytoplasmic tRNA play a significant role in minimizing PKR activation either directly or through effects on tRNA structure. Lastly, these results further support our earlier conclusion that PKR activation by tRNA is not 5\u2032-triphosphate-dependent in that neither of these tRNAs has a 5\u2032-triphosphate yet they are both potent activators: the unmodified T7-mt-tRNAMet has a hammerhead ribozyme-generated 5\u2032-hydroxyl while the natively isolated mt-tRNAMet has a 5\u2032-monophosphate.",

The Huh-7 cell line was chosen because it can produce interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2 and has the capacity to signal from the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor [27]. These cells can thus lead to PKR phosphorylation without the addition of IFN. Transfection with the positive control of dsRNA-79 induced activation of PKR (Fig. 5, lane 2), while the mock transfection with RNA omitted did not (Fig. 5, lane 1). Transfections of Huh-7 cells with a T7 transcript of yeast tRNAphe or natively isolated yeast tRNAphe were also conducted. The T7 transcript induced activation of PKR to the same level as the same amount of dsRNA-79 (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 2, respectively), while native tRNAphe did not activate PKR above the background found in the mock lane (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3 and 1, respectively). These results parallel those found in vitro (Fig. 1B) and indicate that tRNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR both in vitro and in vivo. It is important to note that unmodified and native yeast tRNAphe are thought to have the same tertiary structure, [41], [42], [44] suggesting that tRNA modifications may play a direct role in suppressing PKR activation in cells, at least in this case.",

Moreover, the dimer form of an unmodified tRNALeu transcript can activate PKR in vitro. Dimerization of tRNA has been long known [45]\u2013[49], however functional significance of such dimers has remained obscure.

Observation that the T7 transcript of tRNALeu monomer did not activate PKR in vitro might seem to indicate that tRNA dimerization is critical for PKR activation; however it has been shown elsewhere that this non-activating transcript does not fold unless its synthetase is present [63]. Moreover, we were unable to detect any dimers of the PKR-activating mt-tRNAMet or other mt-tRNAs in vitro (Fig. S2 in File S1). On a related note, an unmodified T7 human mt-tRNAMet transcript, which is very close in sequence to the PKR-activating bovine version, adopts a cloverleaf structure [64]. This observation strengthens the importance of having native secondary structure in monomeric tRNA in order to activate PKR. This then suggests that RNA modifications play dual roles in suppressing activation of PKR by tRNA: 1.) They may help to abrogate activation when tRNA is a monomer with native secondary structure, which is supported by in vivo activation by natively folded yeast T7 tRNAPhe, and 2.) They may stabilize native tertiary structure to prevent the tRNA from dimerizing, which potentially activate PKR. Indeed, a role for RNA modifications in suppressing PKR activation has been reported previously for a non-dsRNA both in vitro and in vivo\n[30], [31].",

This possibility supports the notion that modification in cellular tRNAs function, at least in part, to suppress intrinsic activation of innate immune responses. It will be of interest to test whether there is a connection between tRNA from pathogens and PKR activation, as related to the innate immune system. In addition, it will be of interest to test whether other classes of cellular RNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR or other innate immune sensors, and if certain cellular factors\u2013for example, RNA modifications, tertiary structure, or protein binding function, at least in part, to suppress an innate immune response.
