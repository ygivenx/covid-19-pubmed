Clinical diagnosis alone may lead to misdiagnosis which can subsequently lead to serious clinical outcome [7, 8]. Several laboratory confirmation tests for dengue infection are currently available, including serological test, virus detection, antigen detection, and genome detection. The use of these tests is still limited since they require sophisticated equipment and well-trained staff [9\u201311]. The accuracy of these tests may vary over the course of illness [12]. Since the serological test requires a pair of serum samples taken two weeks apart to confirm a rise in IgM/IgG dengue antibody, this test may not be practical for initial diagnosis of dengue [12]. Other factors could also interfere with the interpretation of the immunological assays, such as history of immunization or previous infection by dengue or other flavivirus. Virus and genome detection can directly identify dengue viral infection. However, virus detection must be performed during the viremic stage, within 1\u20135 days of onset of fever [1].",

The accuracy of the NS1 antigen rapid test is considered high with sensitivity 55%-82% and specificity 97%-100%. Since the NS1 rapid test aims to detect dengue NS1 antigen, it should be performed within 5 days of onset of fever. However, this rapid test is not generally performed in many health facilities due to its cost [1]. Even though laboratory confirmation is highly recommended for dengue diagnosis, laboratory tests for dengue infection are generally inaccessible, particularly in resource limited settings. Commonly, physicians make diagnosis of dengue infection based only on clinical signs and symptoms [2], even though clinical diagnosis is difficult and may vary, particularly among inexperienced physicians [14, 15].",

            "text": "Application of machine learning techniques in health practice has been shown to speed up the process of diagnosis, and help avoid some human errors [16]. Bayesian networks (BN) are one such approach and have been widely applied in medicine due to their ability to effectively handle uncertain information. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of probability distribution in which nodes represent random variables and links represent direct probabilistic influence among the variables [17]. The relation between a node and its parents is quantified by a conditional probability table (CPT), specifying the probability of the random variable conditioned on all combinations of the values of the parents. The structure of the network encodes information about probabilistic independence such that the CPTs along with the independence relations provide a full specification of the joint probability distribution over the random variables represented by nodes. By decomposing a joint probability distribution into a collection of smaller local distributions (the CPTs), a Bayesian network provides a highly compact representation of the complete joint distribution. In BN diagnostic models, factors that can influence the diagnosis, including clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory results are included in the model to form a causal relationship network [18]. Findings are entered into the model as evidence and the posterior probability of disease is computed. Previous studies have shown that Bayesian networks can accurately perform diagnosis and prediction of diseases or health conditions for wide variety of problems [19, 20].",

This was used rather than backward elimination since initial inclusion of all variables in the model would result in conditional probability tables too large for the available data, which would confound attempts to determine the influence of each variable. The variables selected by forward selection on each of the three models were included in the final Bayesian network diagnostic model.

In addition, lymphocyte, platelet, white blood cell count, AST/ALT, atypical lymphocyte, and hematocrit are also related to dengue infection. Interestingly, duration of fever prior to diagnosis appeared to influence physician diagnosis of dengue [1]. Clinical symptoms and laboratory results are usually dynamic over the course of illness [32\u201336]. Awareness of this can assist physicians in differentiating dengue patients from other patients. Therefore, our dengue diagnosis BN model also included duration of fever as prior information to determine the effect of clinical and laboratory profiles on the probability of having dengue. Individual background immunological profile for dengue or other flaviviruses due to direct infection or immunization may also determine clinical manifestation of current dengue infection. Since dengue vaccine is just recently available, including history of infection or immunization for dengue or other flavivirus diseases could potentially improve the performance of future BN diagnostic models.",

Data collected specifically for research purposes is likely to be more complete and valid, as compared with data generally collected for medical services. Laboratory confirmation for dengue, including PCR and serology tests, and other common tropical diseases were performed in all patients, which ensured the accuracy of our main outcome, dengue infection. However, using data from only one hospital may limit the generalizability of the results. As the Hospital for Tropical Diseases is a specialized hospital, patients who visited the hospital may be different from other hospitals in terms of disease distribution and patient characteristics. In this study, about 50% of AUFI patients had dengue infection. Whereas, a previous study conducted in Thailand in 2004 reported dengue infection in only 15% of AUFI patients [43]. Nevertheless, data collection in this study was conducted during 2013, when a dengue outbreak was reported throughout Thailand [44]. Moreover, the laboratory diagnosis of dengue in the previous study was based on only serology for dengue serotype 2 and 4 while the present study used both PCR and serology for all serotypes [21, 43]. These could explain the difference in proportion of dengue cases observed in the previous study. A large proportion of dengue infection among AUFI cases in this study can affect the model\u2019s ability to correctly predict dengue infection when the model suggests positive for dengue (positive predictive value: PPV). In this study the PPV was 75% and 66% in the BN model with and without the NS1 test, respectively. These values could be lower if the model was applied in areas with a smaller proportion of dengue among AUFI cases. As a specialized hospital, acute febrile patients observed in this hospital may come with unusual manifestations that lead to difficulty in making diagnosis by inexperienced physicians. Therefore, data used in this study would benefit the usefulness of our BN model, in which the model could potentially assist decision making particularly in the difficult cases.",

Although the physician\u2019s diagnosis was made according to the WHO criteria for dengue diagnosis, the agreement on dengue diagnosis among the two experts in this study was moderate with the Cohen\u2019s Kappa coefficients of about 0.5. This suggests relatively low reliability of physician diagnosis [8, 12]. As expert performance in this study was determined by consensus of two or three physicians, the performance of other individual physicians may vary from that observed in this study. Use of a BN diagnostic model could help to increase reliability of the diagnosis. However, further study of implementation of the BN diagnostic model for prospective clinical diagnoses in different settings is required to confirm the validity and usefulness of the model in a real setting.",

It should be considered to increase dengue diagnostic performance and as a means of elevating diagnostic capacity for AFI in general. In addition, the speed and reliability of the BN model could support decision making in limited resource setting where physician fatigue is an issue since the performance of the BN model is independent of high volume of case load.",
