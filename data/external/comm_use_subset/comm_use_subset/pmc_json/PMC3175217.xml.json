Pregnancy, severe obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes have been reported as risk factors for critical illness following infection with the pandemic virus [1,2]. Persistence of viral secretion has been found in the patients with the worst outcomes [3-5]. Prompt antiviral treatment has been recognized as a protective factor [6]. A number of studies report increased and persistent levels of cytokines and chemokines paralleling severe disease [7,3,8]. A exacerbated cytokine response can contribute to immune-mediated tissue damage during viral infections [9,10]. In this sense, unregulated cytokine and interferon responses have been described to parallel persistence of viral replication and severe disease in SARS [11]. The cause of the observed hypercytokinemia in severe 2009 pandemic influenza is unclear. As previously described, uncontrolled influenza virus replication could strongly influence cytokine production [5,12,13].",

Only those patients with confirmed H1N1 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were included in the study. Blood samples for plasma and serum were collected by using serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) venous blood vacuum collection tubes following the manufacturer's instructions in the next 24 hours following admission to the ICU, according to a unified protocol for all the participant centers. A pharyngeal sample was collected in parallel. Fifteen healthy volunteers of similar age to the patients were recruited among workers of the University of Valladolid, Spain. A standard survey was employed to collect the clinical data, including history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, haematological, biochemical, radiological and microbiological investigation in all the participant centers. Treatment decisions for all patients were not standardized and were decided by the attending physician. Informed consent was obtained directly from each patient or their legal representative and also from the healthy controls before enrolment. Patient and control identification remained anonymous. Approval of the study protocol in both the scientific and the ethical aspects was obtained from the Scientific Committees for Clinical Research of each one of the participant centers. Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until viral load quantification, cytokine and antibody profiling. Patients were split into two groups, depending on the severity of the respiratory failure. The MV group underwent intubation and ventilation (n = 15); the NMV group was composed of eight patients not requiring mechanical ventilation during ICU hospitalization.",

These samples were also assessed by multiplex PCR (Luminex) with the xTAG RVP kit from Luminex-Abbott for co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumovirus, enteroviruses, rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, 229E, OC43, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Viral load was quantified in pharyngeal swabs and plasma in the Virology Lab of the WHO associated center at Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain. A first single real time RT-PCR was performed for influenza A viral load quantification with a set of primers and probes specific for the influenza virus matrix protein (M1) gene [14]. A standard graph was constructed from the threshold cycle values obtained from serially diluted cRNA control. cRNA control was manufactured from PCR product cloned into plasmid (pGEM-T Easy Vector System, Promega). This plasmid contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream of the insert to drive transcription by this enzyme. Previous to be in vitro transcribed using MEGAscript Kit (Ambion), the plasmid was linearized with a restriction enzyme (SpeI, New England Biolabs) downstream of the insert. With an additional DNase treatment any residual DNA was removed from RNA transcript. Finally RNA was purified using MEGAclear Kit (Ambion). The concentration and purity of the RNA control was calculated by measuring OD260/280. Known RNA control was serially diluted ten-fold in sterile water for use in real time PCR. The limit of detection was 1.86 log10 RNA copies/reaction with a 98.3% efficiency (data not shown). Oseltamivir resistance was directly detected in the initial positive pharyngeal swab by RT-PCR and sequencing of a 1296-bp fragment of the neuraminidase gene for the presence of the mutation H274Y by using an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer. Standard respiratory and blood cultures were performed to assess the presence of bacterial and fungal infection [15], along with detection of urinary antigen test to Legionella pneumophila or Streptococcus pneumoniae.",

The low number of patients available for inclusion in that period (8 samples from 4 MV patients and 7 samples from 6 NMV patients) precluded perhaps to obtain significant differences between patients with different degree of respiratory involvement in that occasion. Nonetheless, we consequently found in ventilated patients higher levels of the same mediators described in the present article. In this new work we studied a larger cohort of patients (n = 23), and cytokine profiles were compared at a punctual moment in the disease course (admission to the ICU). This approach evidenced that, at admission, the most severe patients (MV) showed an exuberant cytokine and chemokine response, in consonance with previous reports [3,7,8]. In turn, this new work aimed to analyze the relationship between viral replication and host cytokine response. In this sense, the most striking finding was that, as occurs in human cases of influenza A/H5N1 infection [13], 2009 pandemic influenza virus replication is directly associated to the host 'cytokine response, pointing to a central role of viral burden in the pathogenesis of severe forms of this disease.",

MIP-1\u03b2 and GM-CSF are chemotactic molecules which mobilize neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages to the site of infection [19]. IL-12p70 and IFN-\u03b3 are critical contributors to adaptive immunity, especially in T helper 1 (Th1)-type responses [20,21]. IL-6 has been reported along with IL-12p70 as markers of critical pandemic influenza illness [7,8]. VEGF is a potent angiogenic factor, and is stimulated in hypoxic patients [22]. In addition, it is thought to increase permeability of the bronchial airway epithelium following infection by respiratory viruses [23]. All these mediators are pro-inflammatory, and in consequence, could play a role in the genesis of the respiratory failure in these patients. Alternatively, they could be neccesary to overcome influenza infection in the most severe patients. IL-1ra is an immuno-modulatory molecule. Secretion of IL-1RA could represent an attempt to prevent cytokine-driven inflammatory damage or alternatively to represent a virus-induced evasion mechanism [19,24]. In turn, elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6 could interfere with the development of an appropriated adaptive immunity response to the virus [25,17,26]. Our results confirm in critically ill patients previous results obtained by Lee et al in hospitalized patients with 2009 pandemic influenza, who demonstrated that high plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 correlated with the extent and progression of pneumonia [5].",

Nonetheless, a detrimental effect of steroids has been documented in severe pandemic influenza, associated to increased risk of bacterial super-infection in the treated patients [31,32].
