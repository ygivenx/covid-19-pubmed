Mobile cellular subscriptions have reached 90% of the world\u2019s population and have reached nearly 80% of the global population living in rural areas [3]. Serving as a 2-way interactive communication tool, mobile health (mHealth) can present opportunities for researchers and program developers to capitalize on the existing cultural behaviors of their target populations, given their rates of access to and use of mobile technology [4]. As van Velthoven et al explain, \u201cthe widespread use of mobile devices and almost universal coverage of the world\u2019s population by a network signal has given mHealth a great opportunity to improve global health\u201d [5]. As a result, mHealth interventions have become increasingly common in low-income and third world countries. In areas where financial resources and health care workforces are lacking, and high rates of disease occur, short message service (SMS) text messaging could potentially make the ability to obtain to health care more accessible and more affordable [6].",

According to Yancey et al, the proportion of people in the United States who are members of at least 2 ethnic groups will increase 10% by the year 2050, complicating assessments of health disparities [11]. However, recent technology trends in the United States indicate mobile phone usage and smartphone adoption rates by those experiencing the highest rates of health disparities are increasing, providing a means for those who work in public health and health education to reach these populations through mHealth interventions. As of January 2017, technology trends indicate that 95% of American adults own a mobile phone, 77% own a smartphone, 22% own an e-reader, 51% own a tablet computer, and 78% own a desktop or laptop computer [7]. The objective of this review was to assess studies conducted in the United States that have used mHealth tools and strategies to develop and implement interventions in underserved populations. This review also examines the ways in which mHealth strategies are being employed in public health interventions to these priority population groups, as mobile phone capabilities include text messaging, mobile apps, internet access, emails, video streaming, social media, instant messaging, and more.",

Statistics regarding SMS text message trends in the United States indicate 80% of all US mobile phone owners text, 92% of US smartphone owners text, and US SMS users text, on an average, 35 texts per day [13]. SMS text messaging interventions in health education and behavior show promise in underserved and minority populations due to increasing usage trends. To date, research shows, African American and Hispanic mobile phone users are more intense and frequent users as compared to white mobile phone users. As of 2011, non-white mobile phone users (African American users in particular) were found to text more often than white mobile phone users, and those with lower levels of income and education were found to text more often than those with higher levels of income and education. Smartphone owners (mean 52.0; median 20) also send and receive a significantly larger number of texts per day than owners of more basic phones (mean 29.7; median 10) [14]. Because more than 70% of all African American and English-speaking Latino mobile phone users use text messaging, versus just over half of white mobile phone users, and 92% of black adults are mobile phone owners, and 56% own a smartphone of some kind [13], the usage of mHealth strategies as a tool to eliminate health disparities shows opportunities of promise.",

Among all Americans, those who classify themselves as Hispanic (58%) and African American (65%) have the lowest rates of high-speed internet access at home compared those who classify themselves as white [7]. This has significantly increased from projections made by Pew Research Center in 2000 and 2010, indicating a doubling of internet use from 11% to 21% [13].

Researchers were able to track the participant\u2019s trends in actually accessing, watching, and completing the video modules. If participants failed to watch the video by a particular benchmark in the week, reminders were made to account for possible attrition and track intervention fidelity. Individuals in the intervention group were responded to questions about each episode by entering the responses on the phones, whereas the comparison group received only written messages communicating HIV risk reduction on the phones. Regarding the intervention group, 97% of the participants reported that they enjoyed watching the video on the mobile phone, 99% thought it was easily accessible, and 97% thought that using the mobile phone was easy. Also, 95% enjoyed the video and enjoyed being able to watch the videos on their phone wherever they went and 93% believed phone training was very helpful. Advantages to the program included mobility, privacy, and increasing the participant\u2019s self-efficacy smartphone usage. Disadvantages included damaged mobile phones (almost half of 161; n=55), stolen mobile phones (56), misplacing login information, inability to recall passwords, and server issues.

This study looked at 3 behaviors: the proportion of condom-protected sexual acts in 6 months and 90 days before assessments, number of sexual episodes while participants were under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and number of vaginal partners before assessments. Conclusively, fewer participants had chlamydia infections in the experimental group than in the condition group, 20% reduction rate, and also fewer gonococcal infections (48 to 54). Participants in the experimental group had a lower risk for chlamydial infections and reported higher condom use and fewer sexual acts while under the influence of drugs, alchohol or both.

The rate of IVR completion had a positive correlation with weight loss; participants with an IVR completion of 80% showed higher weight loss numbers than participants with less than 80% completion rate [29].",

The focus group determined the target populations\u2019 actions, motivators, and barriers. This information was used to create a text campaign for 30 study participants that was tailored specifically to each participant\u2019s time and educational needs. Participants received their personalized texts about cervical health and screenings at their specified times for 7 consecutive days. Comparing baseline data and post intervention data, there were statistically significant increases in knowledge of general cervical health, cancer, risk factors, and pap tests as well as change in beliefs about pap tests. Moreover, 23% of participants received pap tests, 83% of participants were satisfied with the program, and 97% stated that they would recommend the program to others [30].",

The study consisted of 60 low-income African American and Latina women who had breast cancer and cancer-related pain. Participants in the intervention group received phone calls twice a week, whereas the control group received usual care of pain and symptom management given by the clinic. Results showed that patients enrolled in the intervention group had a significant decrease in the proportion of women reporting moderate to severe pain. There was a decrease in the control group as well, but it was not statistically significant. The IVR intervention improved other cancer-related symptoms such as sleep disturbance and drowsiness [32].",

Does anyone in the household have runny nose, congestion, sore throat, cough, body aches, or fever, or feels [sick] hot? 1: yes; 2: no. If participants reported they were ill, a home visit was then conducted to obtain a nasal swab. Overall, 11,282 SMS text messages were sent, with a 73% response rate in the first month. From the time a patient showed symptoms, it took a median of 2 days for them to receive a nasal swab. Results of the samples obtained showed 236 samples (65%) were positive for a respiratory pathogen and 44 (19%) were positive for influenza. The nasal swabs also detected 12 other pathogens including coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. The use of SMS text messaging for interventions allows participants to report symptoms in a timely manner and also allows for a large number of participants to be simultaneously monitored [33].",

This is imperative as it relates to underserved populations, as they suffer from the poorest of health outcomes, comprise the population served most via government assistance programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, and contribute to the astronomical health care cost and expenditures to our health care system. As Kumar et al explains, these technologies can support continuous health monitoring at both the individual and population level, encourage healthy behaviors to prevent or reduce health problems, support chronic disease self-management, enhance provider knowledge, reduce the number of health care visits, and provide personalized, localized, and on-demand interventions in ways previously unimaginable [34]. This is important when we compare the potential of mHealth in underserved, low SES population groups where traditional mass media health campaigns have been unsuccessful. Messages need to be designed to meet the \u201cliteracy, language, cultural and motivational needs of the population [35]. mHealth technologies can meet these needs by effectively tailoring health information using a tool that most patients already use or have access too. Due to this, mHealth has proven to be a potential route in reducing the incidence and prevalence of health disparities among our disadvantaged and underserved populations.",

Most of the current apps are developed from the perspective of the health care system for the general population versus public health interventions to underserved communities. As a result, research regarding the use of mHealth interventions for the populations that need it the most remains sparse. All chronic health conditions experienced by underserved populations could benefit from mHealth interventions due to the vast range of apps they can cover. As Nundy et al argues, wider mobile phones usage among minority groups has expanded access to address health disparities [36]. However, though the numbers of mHealth pilot studies are increasing, many of these pilot studies are focused solely on the assessment of mobile phone usage and ownership and fail to follow through with an implementation component to the study design.",

An overview of the field indicates mHealth is becoming more common in health care and public health, and this collection of 16 articles does not represent the full range of projects being implemented using mobile phones in the United States. Interventions included in our review had to outline in the title, abstract, or in the study\u2019s participants sections that the target participants were members of minority or underserved population subgroups, thus severely limiting studies that could be examined. Names of specific race and ethnic groups (African American or black, Latino or Hispanic, Native American, Asian, etc) were not used during the search results, although doing so might have yielded more studies. We wanted to search on a broader more general level instead of focusing on a specific race and ethnicity. It may be beneficial to conduct searches for specific races and ethnicities. Additionally, because the term mobile health has been previously associated with mobile health units, which are also used to increase access to care in low-income and disparate populations, it was decided to limit articles to those published between 2009 and 2016, which could have eliminated mHealth studies published earlier. Finally, when completing the literature search using key search phrases in the institution\u2019s e-library database, 3 of the search phrases returned more than 2000+ articles; however, articles past the first 1000 articles could not be accessed. Therefore, for those 3 key phrases, search filters had to be applied individually rather than all at once, which could have affected the overall number of articles obtained",

Increased technology use among rural populations increased the opportunity for easier, faster, and more efficient access to health information for this population subgroup.
