They are generally responsible for mild enteric and respiratory infections, but they can also be associated with severe disease in both humans and animals (Masters & Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are now recognized as emerging viruses with a propensity to cross into new host species, as has been shown by the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Coleman & Frieman, 2014). As illustrated in Fig. 1 for feline coronavirus (FCoV), two-thirds of the coronavirus genome encodes proteins involved in viral RNA synthesis. The majority of these proteins are encoded in two 5\u2032-proximal, overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, and are translated as the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are then processed by virus-encoded proteinases into 16 non-structural proteins (Ziebuhr, 2005). The remainder of the genome encodes the virus structural proteins (S, E, M and N), as well as accessory proteins that are not essential for replication in cell culture. The structural and accessory proteins are translated from a 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (Perlman & Netland, 2009).",

These elements include heptad repeats, a fusion peptide and a carboxyl-terminal, hydrophobic transmembrane domain (Heald-Sargent & Gallagher, 2012). In many coronaviruses, the S1 and S2 domains are cleaved from each other by a cellular, furin-like enzyme (de Haan et al., 2004). The S protein is also the location of both B- and T-cell epitopes that are important in virus neutralization and the recognition of virus-infected cells (Reguera et al., 2012; Satoh et al., 2011).",

FCoV infections are endemic among cats worldwide, and serological and molecular studies confirm that serotype 1 FCoVs predominate (Pedersen, 2014b). In the UK, about 40 % of domestic cats have been infected with FCoV, and in multi-cat households, this figure increases to almost 90 % (Addie, 2000; Addie & Jarrett, 1992). The majority of FCoV infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild enteric disease. However, approximately 5 % of infected cats develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a systemic inflammatory disease that is a frequent cause of death in young cats (Kipar & Meli, 2014). Currently, there is no protective vaccine or effective treatment for FIP (Pedersen, 2009, 2014a).",

            "text": "The most important questions in FCoV research are why some infected animals remain relatively healthy whilst others develop FIP, and what the role of the virus is in the development of disease. It is now widely accepted that, in the vast majority of cases, cats are infected by the faecal\u2013oral route with avirulent FCoV strains circulating in the cat population. Initially, this virus replicates predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is shed with the faeces. Nonetheless, it often leads to systemic infection via monocyte-associated viraemia (Kipar et al., 2010; Meli et al., 2004; Porter et al., 2014). At this stage, however, the systemic infection is characterized by a relatively low level of virus replication and infection can be maintained for a prolonged period of time, possibly involving recurrent viraemic events, without apparent disease (Kipar et al., 2010). During replication in the intestine or, potentially, within monocytes/macrophages (Pedersen et al., 2012), the virus undergoes mutation, and viruses with an enhanced tropism for monocytes and macrophages emerge. The altered tropism of these mutants results in their ability to maintain effective and sustainable replication in monocytes (Dewerchin et al., 2005). As a direct or indirect result of a higher level of virus replication, this now apparently virulent virus leads to activation of monocytes (Regan et al., 2009), which can then interact with endothelial cells. This, in turn, mediates granulomatous phlebitis and periphlebitis, the morphological hallmark and initiating lesion of FIP (Kipar et al., 2005).",

For example, the efficacy of early T-cell responses critically determines the disease outcome in cats that have been infected experimentally with a virulent serotype 2 strain, FIPV 79-1146 (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005). Furthermore, there is individual variation in the susceptibility of a cat\u2019s monocytes to FCoV (Dewerchin et al., 2005). Also, recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the feline IFN-\u03b3 gene have been linked to both resistance and susceptibility to the development of FIP (Hsieh & Chueh, 2014). Clearly, unravelling the relationship between FCoV genotypes and phenotypes and the complex interactions between the virus and host during the development of FIP remains a major challenge.",

As a first step, this can be done by comparing the genomic sequences of viruses shed in the faeces of healthy animals and viruses that predominate within tissue lesions of cats that have been diagnosed with FIP. This approach assumes that the most highly abundant genome in a population is responsible for a particular disease phenotype, which is consistent with our current understanding of FIP epidemiology. Using this approach, a recent study by Chang et al. (2012) provided evidence for an association between FCoV virulence and amino acid substitutions within the putative fusion peptide of the FCoV S protein. A more detailed examination of samples from FCoV-infected cats that did not have histopathological evidence of FIP led Porter et al. (2014) to conclude that these substitutions were indicative of systemic spread, rather than a virus that, without further mutation, is able to cause FIP. As the S protein fusion peptide is involved in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes during virus entry, it seems plausible that changes within this region may be linked to the tropism of the virus.",

Prominent among these are reports that truncating and non-truncating mutations in the ORF3c gene occur in a significant proportion of but not all FCoVs associated with FIP (Chang et al., 2010; Pedersen et al., 2012). However, the role of the FCoV 3c protein and any relationship to the development of FIP is still unclear. One view is that functional 3c protein expression is essential for replication in the gut but is dispensable for systemic replication. Thus, once the virus has left the gut, there is no further selection pressure to maintain an intact 3c gene and mutations will accumulate over time. This interpretation does not exclude the possibility that loss or alteration of the 3c protein may enhance the fitness of the virus in the monocyte/macrophage environment, but this is not yet supported by any convincing evidence. Similarly, whilst the genes encoding the 3a, 3b, 7a and 7b proteins clearly have important functions that will impact on virus fitness (Haijema et al., 2004), there is, as yet, no evidence that links specific mutations in these genes to the development of FIP.",

The seven amplicons for each of the faecal-derived RNA samples were of the expected size and were produced in approximately equal amounts. In comparison, there was greater heterogeneity in the amplicons obtained from RNA isolated from the FIP tissue lesions (Fig. 2). Specifically, there was more evidence of non-specific products and, especially in the case of amplicon 6, which encompasses the region of the genome encoding the S protein gene, there was less product than expected. In this context, we noted that the cycle threshold (C\nt) values were generally higher (i.e. less viral RNA) for faecal samples than for samples from the FIP tissue lesions. The mean C\nt values for the 65F, 67F and 80F faecal total RNA samples were 20.9, 16.9 and 29.0, respectively, and for the 26M, 27C and 28O tissue lesion samples were 14.0, 21.5 and 15.0, respectively. One explanation for the difference in homogeneity of amplicons derived from faecal and lesional samples may be that the samples derived from lesions contained significantly greater amounts of FCoV subgenomic mRNA than the faecal samples, which would be expected to contain mainly virion particles. Also, immunohistochemistry identified a large number of macrophages with abundant viral antigen (i.e. N protein) within the lesions (data not shown). It is therefore very likely that the RNA extracted from the lesions contained much more viral mRNA than the faeces. Thus, in the reverse transcription (RT)-PCRs that involved RNA from tissues, many of the oligonucleotide primers would bind to multiple templates, resulting in a more complex amplicon pattern.",

However, only 76.8 % of reads from the 27C sample aligned with the 80F target genome. Thus, for the 27C sample, the de novo assembly method had to be used. De novo assembly is more time consuming and would not be a good approach if every sample had to be analysed in this manner, as would be the case if they were highly divergent. It should also be noted that, in our analysis, we only compared genome consensus sequences where each position was defined by a single nucleotide. In reality, for any sample, many nucleotide positions are represented by a proportion of different nucleotides. In these cases, we took the majority nucleotide as the consensus nucleotide and did not attempt to delineate different populations in the quasispecies.

Without any further information, it is difficult to conclude that any of these substitutions, alone or in combination, may be related to the development of FIP. However, they should not be ignored. For example, the substitutions resulting from mutations at nt 22 528 and 22 539 both lie within the furin cleavage motif that separates the S1 (receptor-binding) and S2 (fusion) domains of the FCoV S protein. Both substitutions (R789G at P4 and R792S at P1, where P4 and P1 designate positions in the canonical furin cleavage motif) would be predicted to alter furin cleavage activity. If this is the case, our results support the conclusions of Licitra et al. (2013) who identified the furin cleavage site as a potentially important region in the development of FIP. Alternatively, it could be argued that once the virus has acquired a tropism for the monocyte/macrophage, cleavage at the furin recognition motif may no longer be relevant to virus entry and mutations may accumulate due to a lack of selection pressure. For coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus, cleavage at the canonical furin motif does not seem to be essential, at least for in vitro infectivity (Bos et al., 1997), and recent results suggest that activation of the coronavirus S protein fusion activity requires proteolytic cleavage at a different position in the S2 subunit (Millet & Whittaker, 2014; Wicht et al., 2014). Finally, Table 1 shows that two of the three translatomes derived from the FIP samples had a deletion in the 3c protein gene, which was not found in any of the non-FIP samples. In both cases, the deletion of 10 nt led to a translational frameshift that produced a 3c protein truncated 8 aa downstream of the deletion site.",

It was based on the generation of a virus-specific cDNA library using oligonucleotide primer pairs, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) on a commercial platform, and downstream genome assembly using free software that will run on a personal computer. This approach was taken after we had failed to determine complete genome sequences of FCoV from clinical samples using a randomly primed cDNA library followed by NGS (Porter, 2014). In the study reported here, complete genome sequencing was achieved for six FCoVs using only seven primer pairs. However, the samples we used were all collected within a few months at a single location, which means that they were less likely to have diverged compared with samples taken at different locations over a longer time period. As the number of complete genome sequences for both serotype 1 and serotype 2 FCoVs increases, it may be possible to design a set of universal primer pairs that will only require minor optimization to successfully sequence any FCoV genome. In our own laboratory, we have shown that the seven primer pairs described here are able to produce amplicons of the expected size in approximately two-thirds of geographically divergent UK faecal samples collected over a 2-year period (unpublished results).",

This substitution is located within the heptad HR1 region of the S2 subunit of the FCoV S protein and could be interesting from two points of view. First, we note that this amino acid position has been identified as being located in a major T-helper 1 (Th1) epitope (I-S2-6, IGNITLALGKVSNAITTTSD) in a type 1 Japanese FCoV (KU-2) that was associated with FIP (Satoh et al., 2011). Obviously, further research will be required to ascertain whether there is a Th1 epitope spanning this amino acid sequence in non-FIP-associated FCoVs, and to determine the quantitative or qualitative effect that may result from the isoleucine-to-threonine substitution. However, de Groot-Mijnes et al. (2005) have already drawn attention to the relationship between T-cell depletion and the enhanced virus replication in FIP cases, although the mechanisms of T-cell depletion are not yet clear. We suggest that this is an area of FIP research that merits further study. For example, it would be interesting to compare IFN-\u03b3 production by PBMCs taken from cats with FIP or healthy FCoV-infected cats, and exposed separately to relevant HR1 peptides, the sequences of which are derived from FIP- and non-FIP-associated FCoVs.",

            "text": "Secondly, a quite different interpretation of the HR1 isoleucine-to-threonine substitution is that it may be related to the fusogenic activity of the FCoV S protein. This is because the substitution also lies within a stretch of 15 aa [NAITT(I/T)SDGFNTMAS] that are found only in alphacoronaviruses and are part of the heptad repeat structure that characterizes the HR1 region. Indeed, the isoleucine/threonine position constitutes a residue predicted to be located on the hydrophobic interface of the coiled-coil structure. Substitution of a hydrophobic residue with a polar, uncharged residue may, at least theoretically, significantly influence the intercalation of HR1 and HR2 regions, which is a necessary event during membrane fusion. It is also worth noting that a very recent study by Bank-Wolf et al. (2014) identified a position two residues downstream of the isoleucine-to-threonine substitution where an aspartate residue was found in all examined non-FIP-associated FCoVs (5/5) but was replaced by a tyrosine in a significant proportion (5/9) of the FIP-associated FCoVs. Neither the isoleucine-to-threonine nor aspartate-to-tyrosine substitutions consistently discriminated between FIP and non-FIP FCoVs in the wider alignment of 29 type 1 FCoV S protein amino acid sequences that we examined (data not shown) but, again, we think they may represent substitutions that are functionally related and could be relevant to the development of FIP.",

In the future, this approach could be extended, i.e. a larger collection of well-defined clinical samples should be analysed, and it can be refined. For example, to distinguish mutations that may relate to the tropism of FCoVs from those that may relate to virulence, we suggest it would be important to obtain sequence data from a virus population that infects monocytes but is not able to replicate at a high level. Clearly, obtaining appropriate clinical samples (e.g. blood monocytes from clinically healthy, FCoV-infected cats) would not be easy, but it would be very illuminating. The idea that a virus has to undergo sequential mutation in vivo in order to cause a specific disease is not unique to FIP (see, for example, the review on measles virus pathogenesis by de Vries et al., 2012), but we suggest it deserves closer attention in a number of veterinary and human diseases.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this sequencing approach is ultimately limited. As has been stated before, compelling evidence that any specific mutation in the FCoV genome is important for the development of FIP will require the use of well-defined and characterized viruses produced by reverse genetics and a valid experimental model of FIP. With respect to reverse genetics, there are a number of robust reverse genetics systems available for coronaviruses in general, and for particular strains of FCoV (namely the type 2 FCoV strain 79-1146 and the cell-culture-adapted type1 FCoV strain Black) (Thiel et al., 2014). The pressing need, however, is for a robust reverse genetics system that can be applied to field strains of type 1 FCoV. In our opinion, the bottleneck is not the molecular manipulation of the FCoV genome but rather the ability to propagate type 1 FCoVs in cell culture without extensive adaptation. Although there has been recent progress in the development of enterocyte cell lines that propagate type 1 FCoVs (Desmarets et al., 2013), we believe that a more robust cell-culture system that allows the propagation of high virus titres and the rescue of both mutated and non-mutated virus will be needed. To achieve this, identification of both the cellular receptor and attachment factors specific to type 1 FCoVs and the transduction of well-established, continuous, feline cell lines that can easily be maintained will be essential.",

For example, many of the commonly used animal models of FIP often involve intraperitoneal inoculation. If the natural course of FCoV infection involves sequential replication in the gut, low-level replication in blood monocytes and high-level replication in monocytes and macrophages, and each transition is associated with the selection of specific mutants, then this has to be reproduced in any valid experimental model. In a recent report, Tekes et al. (2012) showed that intraperitoneal infection of cats with a recombinant form of the FCoV 79-1146 strain robustly induced FIP. Strikingly, the virus reisolated from these cats demonstrated that there had been strong selection for a virus that reverted to encode an intact 3c protein. This is, in our view, good evidence that FIP results from an infection that involves initial replication in the gut.",
