As of February 9, 2018, MERS has been reported in 27 countries with 2143 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 750 deaths (~35% mortality rate). MERS-CoV is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is in the same \u03b2-coronavirus genus as MERS-CoV and caused an outbreak during 2002\u20132003 with a 9.6% fatality rate2. MERS-CoV leads to progressive severe pneumonia in infected patients, with diffuse alveolar damage occurring during the acute phase. More severe infections are accompanied by considerable extrapulmonary organ dysfunction in the later phase3\u20136. SARS-CoV infections have been shown to lack type I interferon responses or cause lymphopenia with decreased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during the acute phase7. However, the mechanism that contributes to severe clinical symptoms in MERS-CoV infections has still not been elucidated, owing to an absence of autopsy studies. The limited data from in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate that MERS-CoV induces a substantial cytopathic effect8 and dysregulation of host immune responses, similar to SARS-CoV9, 10.",

            "text": "Through comparative studies with SARS-CoV infection, immune-mediated pathogenesis has been proposed as a potential factor for severe outcome in MERS-CoV-infected patients11, 12. SARS patients showing hyper-immune activation, including aberrant expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes and cytokine responses, are likely to succumb to SARS-CoV infection, the severity of which correlates with the amount of inflammatory cytokines present in the serum13\u201315. Clinical data on the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infections are sparse. Josset et al.6 reported that MERS-CoV significantly downregulated the expression of genes involved in the antigen presentation pathway, which, in turn, could affect the development of adaptive immune responses. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and IL-8, were markedly induced in Calu-3 cells after MERS-CoV infection16. Zhou et al.10 also speculated that cytokine storms could correlate with the severity of illness, since high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed to be secreted by human macrophages upon MERS-CoV infection. Previously, we observed aberrant immune responses in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice, such as elevated secretion of the cytokines IFN-\u03b3-induced protein 10 (IP-10), IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-17, all of which are closely associated with virally mediated acute lung injury14, 17\u201319. Nevertheless, the role of MERS-CoV-induced excessive inflammatory responses as a factor contributing to the severity of disease outcome needs to be further studied.",

            "text": "The complement system plays an important role in host defense against microbial infection and maintains immune homeostasis. However, complement also contributes to the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and immunological diseases when excessively or inappropriately activated20. The biological effector functions of complement are mediated primarily through split products (i.e., C3a and C5a), which promote inflammation via direct and indirect mechanisms upon interaction with their respective receptors, C3a receptor and C5a receptor (C5aR)21. In addition to serving as a potent chemoattractant, C5a can also activate leukocytes, stimulate the release of granzymes, and stimulate phagocytosis and respiratory burst of mononuclear cells22. Furthermore, C5a induces mononuclear cells to express IL-1 and IL-8 in vitro and enhances IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 release in vivo23. Antibody (Ab) blockade of C5a or C5aR has been reported to abrogate excessive immune responses in a mouse model of Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection24. In our previous studies using H5N1-infected mouse models or an H7N9-infected non-human primate model, inhibition of over-activated complement system alleviated virus-induced acute lung injury25, 26.",

Therefore, in this study, we demonstrate that MERS-CoV infection induced complement overactivation and led to severe lung damage, but that blockade of the interaction between C5a and C5aR alleviated tissue injury by re-establishing normal local and systemic immune responses, including reduced infiltration of tissue macrophages, inflammatory cytokine expression, and apoptosis of splenic cells and increased T cell regeneration. Therefore, it is suggested that complement inhibition may be a promising interventional strategy for treating MERS-CoV-infected patients.",

The results showed that deposition of C5b-9 increased after viral infection (Fig. 1a\u2013d). The expression of C5aR in lungs was also increased, especially in the bronchus epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and inflammatory cells, as detected by immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 1e, f). The relative expression of C5aR at the transcription level also confirmed the increased complement expression in lung tissue at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 1g). Furthermore, the presence of C5a in sera, as an indicator of complement activation, was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that after MERS-CoV infection, the C5a concentration increased at days 1 and 7 but decreased at day 3 post-infection (Fig. 1h). We speculate that MERS-CoV infection could promptly induce activation of both local and systemic complement activity. Subsequently, the virus-infected host may initiate a self-protection mechanism to suppress the over-activated complement response, resulting in the observed decrease in C5a production. However, continued viral replication may eventually overcome the host response, leading to a stronger complement activation and a rebound in C5a production. These findings suggest a close relationship between systemic inflammatory response and local tissue damage.",

Therefore, to elucidate the role of excessive complement activation in infectious MERS-CoV-induced tissue damage, a mAb against the mouse C5a receptor was used to block the interaction of C5a with its receptor C5aR. After treatment, damage was lessened and only mild focal thickened alveolar septa was observed, especially around vessels, and no edema or hemorrhage in lungs was observed (Fig. 4d\u2013f). A semi-quantitative analysis also confirmed the relatively less severe damage of lung tissues (Fig. 4g). In addition, after blockade, decreased weight loss was observed in the one mouse left alive compared with that observed in the sham treatment group (Fig. 4h, i), although the single mouse surviving treatment is not significant. The results further indicated that the blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR axis could alleviate lung damage in hDPP4-transgenic mice, although an antiviral agent inhibiting MERS-CoV infection may be required in combination with the anti-C5aR Ab to increase the survival rate of MERS-CoV-infected mice.",

To test our hypothesis that blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR interaction may reduce spleen damage, spleen tissue was examined in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-transgenic mice with or without treatment with the anti-C5aR Ab. The results showed that a significant number of splenic cells presented necrosis or apoptosis, especially in the white pulp (yellow arrow), while numerous inflammatory cells infiltrated the red pulp (Fig. 5a, c, e). Interestingly, mice provided the anti-C5aR Ab treatment exhibited less spleen damage with less splenic cell necrosis or apoptosis and increased numbers of macrophages were detected in red pulp (blue arrow) (Fig. 5b, d, f). However, no MERS-CoV replication or viral antigen expression was observed in the spleens of mice in the treated and untreated groups (data not shown). Collectively, these findings suggest that the damages to the spleen tissue were not caused by MERS-CoV replication in the splenocytes but may result from the dysregulated immune and inflammatory responses caused by MERS-CoV infection in the lungs or other susceptible organs. Importantly, the anti-C5aR Ab treatment could significantly attenuate the spleen damage, suggesting that the dysregulated immune and inflammatory responses are likely closely associated with the complement system of the host.",

In this study, a human DPP4 transgenic (hDDP4-Tg) mouse model we previously developed was used to investigate whether MERS-CoV infection can cause aberrant systemic inflammatory responses27. One may question whether the human DPP4 protein expressed in the Tg mouse itself may cause dysregulated immune and inflammatory responses since hDPP4 can function as a signaling protein on the surface of T cells, as an enzyme cleaving chemokines or cytokines in the lungs and brain, and a as costimulatory molecule for inducing cell proliferation29. However, in our previous study, we observed that the hDPP4-Tg and wild-type C57BL/6 mice had very similar presentations of immune responses without MERS-CoV infection (data not shown). In addition, Tseng\u2019s group did not observe dysregulated immune and inflammatory responses in the hDDP4-Tg mice before viral challenge30. Above all, these results suggested that the human DPP4 protein expressed in the TG mouse may not significantly influence immune and inflammatory responses in mice, possibly because of the differences in DPP4 between species. The results of this study confirm that aberrant systemic inflammatory responses, especially those mediated by the dysregulated complement system as induced by MERS-CoV infection, may contribute to the severe outcome of such infections. Furthermore, blocking the C5a\u2013C5aR interaction and complement activation by blocking the C5a\u2013C5aR axis could be a promising strategy for the adjunctive treatment of MERS-CoV infection.",

Compared to patients with dengue fever (DF), severely ill patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome have been shown to have higher levels of C3 cleavage products, specifically fD, which cleaves fB to yield the active (C3bBb) C3 convertase, and lower levels of fH, which inactivates the C3 convertase31\u201333. In addition, high levels of C3a, C5a, and sC5b-9 were observed to be present before plasma leakage occurred in DHF patients34. Moreover, expression of the complement inhibitor CD59-encoding gene was up-regulated more strongly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DF patients than in DHF patients35. These studies implicated the role of the complement system in the pathogenesis of severe forms of Dengue virus-associated diseases. In a Ross River virus (RRV)-induced complement-deficient mouse model, less severe tissue damage and disease symptoms following RRV infection also indicated an important role of complement in the RRV-induced pathogenesis36. In our previous study on highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus infection, dysregulated complement activation was observed to be accompanied by severe lung damage, which suggested that aberrant complement regulation may be an important causative factor after H5N1 virus infection25.",

For example, C5a induces the expression of IL-1 and IL-8 in mononuclear cells in vitro, and it enhances the release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in vivo23. In this study, aberrant complement activation was confirmed in the lung tissues of mice after MERS-CoV infection, which prompted us to investigate the contribution of complement in the outcome of MERS-CoV infection. As expected, by blocking the C5a\u2013C5aR axis, lung injury was alleviated after MERS-CoV infection, with less tissue damage accompanied by decreased infiltration of lung tissue macrophages and decreased systemic inflammatory response, especially the Th1 immune response as detected by IL-12 levels in sera. Previous studies based on infected human macrophages and dendritic cells indicated that MERS-CoV significantly induced the expression of inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, as well as chemokines such as IP-10, MCP-1, IL-8, and IL-12 in macrophages and dendritic cells10, 37, 38. The host immune response triggered by MERS-CoV infection is a double-edged sword. It may help to suppress viral infection, but can cause severe lung damage as shown in this study. Importantly, we determined that blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR interaction by an anti-C5aR Ab could significantly reduce alveolar macrophage infiltration and IFN-\u03b3 receptor expression in lung tissue, resulting in alleviation of tissue damage induced by the excessive immune response.",

Thus, the spleen is pivotal for maintaining blood homeostasis and producing immune responses to viral infection39. The spleen is divided into the white and red pulps, which are separated by the marginal zone, where vast splenic macrophage populations, such as marginal metallophilic macrophages, marginal zone macrophages, and red pulp macrophages are now considered to play important roles in the control of infection, as well as in the induction of innate and adaptive immunity40. For example, red pulp macrophages can prevent autoimmunity by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10, and by inducing T-regulatory cells41. These cytokines may be important to curb an excessive immune response that could be deleterious to the host after pathogen clearance. In our study, increased numbers of macrophages in splenic red pulp and decreased IL-12 concentrations in sera were observed in the treatment group compared to the sham treatment group, indicating that the anti-C5aR Ab treatment may decrease the excessive complement immune response induced by MERS-CoV infection.",

Ward and colleagues43 and Ward44 demonstrated that C5aR plays a crucial role in the development of septic lymphopenia and that targeting C5a to prevent lymphopenia can be considered to restore normal immune responses in lieu of \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d strategies. Chu et al45. demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection induced apoptosis of human primary T lymphocytes involved in the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway. Our study confirmed that MERS-CoV contributed to apoptosis of splenic cells in vivo, accompanied by severe spleen damage and dysregulated systemic immune response, indicating that T cells play a role in controlling the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection. It is possible that regulation of the host immune response by complement improved the status of spleen tissue by decreasing splenic apoptosis and increasing the regeneration of splenic cells, indicating that induction of C5a production by MERS-CoV infection may contribute to the dysregulated immune responses, while blockade of the C5a\u2013C5aR axis may improve outcomes by restoring normal immune responses.",
