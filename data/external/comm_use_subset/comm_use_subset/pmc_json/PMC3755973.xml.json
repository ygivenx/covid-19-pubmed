Limited reports in humans [3,7,8] and extensive studies in animals [9\u201313] have shown that severe hMPV infection is associated with the disruption of the epithelial architecture and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates around and within alveoli. Among the diverse small animal models that have been evaluated, BALB/c mice have emerged as an excellent model for recapitulating hMPV infection, including efficient viral replication in the lungs, concomitant pulmonary inflammation and airway obstruction as well as disease severity that correlates with increasing viral inoculums [10,14\u201316]. BALB/c mouse studies have also shown that the immune response to hMPV infection can be both disproportionate and inefficient, characterized by a weak innate response and a Th2-biased adaptive immune response, leading to impaired virus clearance and prolonged pulmonary inflammation [10,14\u201316].",

Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue licensed for treatment of severe human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infections, exhibits moderate in vitro activity against hMPV and was found to be beneficial in the mouse model [18,19]. Indeed, this antiviral has been used to treat a few severe cases of hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals [20\u201322]. The mechanisms of action of ribavirin do not appear to be limited to the disruption of the viral purin metabolism and inhibition of viral RNA polymerase. It has been shown that this drug could also upregulate IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3 and downregulate Th2 cytokines such as IL-10 in vitro, suggesting an immunomodulatory as well as an antiviral effect [23]. However, ribavirin is associated with many side-effects and teratogenicity [24], which limits its widespread use. Thus, the development of new antivirals and/or immunomodulatory strategies is warranted for the treatment of severe hMPV infections.",

Increasing interactions between these two systems are being discovered, including during viral infection [26]. Serine proteases of the coagulation cascade, such as thrombin, are able to activate complement components [27,28] and to regulate cell function through the activation of a family of G-protein coupled receptors called protease-activated receptors (PAR) [29\u201333]. PARs have a unique mechanism of activation in which irreversible proteolytic cleavage within the extracellular N-terminus of the receptor exposes a new N-terminal sequence that acts as a tethered ligand. The latter interacts with the second extracellular loop of the receptor, hereby activating the receptor [30,34,35]. Four PARs have been characterized until now (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3 and PAR4). They are all activated by thrombin except PAR2 for which the main activating protease is trypsin [30,35].",

            "text": "PAR1 in particular is a ubiquitous receptor present in platelets, endothelial and epithelial cells, neurons, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, leukocytes and tumor cell lines [30]. PAR1 is a receptor involved in many physiological processes including the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems as well as in embryogenesis, cancer and inflammation [35]. In fact, some PAR1 antagonists are currently in clinical trials for their antiplatelet activities [36,37]. The role of PAR1 in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases has recently been investigated for a number of pathogens including feline immunodeficiency virus [38], Mycobacterium tuberculosis [39], dengue virus [40], herpes simplex virus [41,42] and influenza A virus [43,44]. For the latter pathogen, upregulation of PAR1 was observed in the airways of mice infected with the highly pathogenic influenza A/PR-8/34 (H1N1) virus [43]. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that PAR1 could also play an important role in modulating the immune response during severe hMPV infection. Therefore, we treated hMPV-infected BALB/c mice with either a selective PAR1 agonist (TFLLR-NH2) or a PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) and then evaluated disease severity. We observed that PAR1 activation increased weight loss and decreased survival in our hMPV mouse model. In contrast, administration of a PAR1 antagonist decreases disease severity and significantly reduced lung cytokines and inflammation in BALB/c mice. The protective effect of the PAR1 antagonist could also be explained by a decrease in furin-mediated cleavage of the viral fusion (F) protein.",

The minimal cleavage site is RXXR\n\u2193, exhibiting a P1 and P4 Arg residues [46]. In order to tentatively investigate the possible mechanism by which PAR1 compounds can influence viral replication, we analyzed furin transcripts in the lungs of hMPV-infected animals by RT-PCR. PAR1 compounds were administered for 5 days at a dose of 500 \u00b5M, starting at the time of infection, and lungs were harvested on day 5 pi. HMPV infection resulted in a significant increase in furin transcripts (by 38%) in mouse lungs compared to uninfected mice (Fig. 4A). Treatment of infected mice with the PAR1 agonist did not significantly alter furin expression. However, treatment of infected mice with the PAR1 antagonist significantly reduced furin transcript levels (by 18%) compared to hMPV-infected/untreated mice. Using a pIRES vector expressing each proprotein convertase, we previously showed a similar expression of each convertase and their ability to cleave selected substrates [47,48]. Thus, we used these same constructs to show that furin was the only tested proprotein convertase that was able to cleave the hMPV fusion precursor protein into its active form (Figure 4B) in two cell lines (COS-1 and HEK293). We then investigated the effect of PAR1 on the cleavage of the hMPV fusion precursor protein (Figure 4C) in this in vitro cleavage assay. Treatment of F protein/furin co-transfected HEK293 cells with either the PAR1 agonist or antagonist did not alter F cleavage (43.7 and 41.2% cleavage, respectively, compared to 36.8%). However, co-transfection of cells with cDNA encoding the F protein, furin as well as recombinant human PAR1 (rhPAR1) reduced F cleavage from 36.8% to 12.4%. When these rhPAR1 expressing co-transfected cells were treated with the PAR1 antagonist, F protein cleavage remained low (12.0%), whereas PAR1 agonist treatment restored F protein cleavage to the basal level observed in cells without rhPAR1 expression (38.2%), confirming a role for PAR1 in the cleavage of the hMPV fusion protein.",

A recent study estimated the hospitalization rate for hMPV in older adults to be 9.8 per 10000 residents, a rate similar to those of hRSV and influenza [51]. Hospitalized patients are currently treated symptomatically, since no specific prophylactic or therapeutic modality is available. Although not approved for this indication, ribavirin has been administered as an antiviral agent in a few severe cases of hMPV pneumonia with variable outcomes [20\u201322]. Several hMPV vaccines have been investigated in animal models, including live-attenuated and subunit vaccines; however, vaccine-induced immunity was often partially protective and/or waned rapidly [52].

To further investigate the PAR1 agonist specificity, we examined its well-known effect on intestinal permeability [55] in wild-type and PAR1-knockout mice. To this end, 51Cr-EDTA was infused in the colon of the mice and the effect of the PAR1 agonist on the passage of 51Cr-EDTA to the blood, reflecting intestinal permeability was measured (Figure S1A). As expected, mice treated with the PAR1 agonist peptide TFLLR displayed enhanced intestinal permeability, compared to saline control treated mice. In marked contrast, mouse treatment with the RLLFT inactive control peptide had no effect on permeability, arguing against potential nonspecific effects of the agonist. More importantly, the effect of the agonist on increased intestinal permeability was abolished in PAR1-deficient mice. Altogether, these results show that the agonist specifically activates PAR1 in mice. Furthermore, this agonist peptide has been also used to specifically activate PAR1 in mice elsewhere [56\u201358]. Subsequently, we also investigated whether the PAR1 antagonist was capable of blocking the specific PAR1 signaling in vivo. We found that antagonist treatment prevented increased intestinal permeability associated with administration of the PAR1 agonist peptide to wild-type mice (Figure S1B). Thus, the effect of the antagonist is likely related to its ability to specifically block PAR1 in vivo. Furthermore, the antagonist has also been used to block PAR1 activation in rodent models elsewhere [56,58\u201360].",

Most strikingly, when treatment was started simultaneously with hMPV-infection and was continued for 5 days, no weight loss or clinical signs were observed (Figure 2). Evaluation of pulmonary inflammation and viral titers was performed on day 5 pi, the time point at which both parameters peak in untreated hMPV-infected mice [10]. During this acute phase of infection, pulmonary inflammation mostly consists of interstitial, perivascular and alveolar inflammation and all these parameters were significantly reduced by treatment with the PAR1 antagonist. In line with this observation, we also showed a significant reduction in the levels of key cytokines/chemokines that are usually increased in hMPV infection (including IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1 and RANTES) [10]. Some of these cytokines namely IL-6, IL-8 (the human equivalent of murine KC) and MCP-1 have been previously shown to be up-regulated by PAR1 activation or down-regulated by PAR1 inhibition in non-infected human respiratory epithelial cells in models of asthma and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [61\u201364]. Furthermore, SCH79797 significantly reduced MCP-1 expression in M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected cells in vitro [39]. Finally, Khoufache et al. recently demonstrated that SCH79797 treatment of influenza A-infected mice also significantly reduced IL-6, KC and RANTES levels in broncho-alveolar lavages [44].",

We did not observe significant differences in pulmonary neutrophils between any of the groups. However, the PAR1 antagonist treatment significantly reduced the recruitment of lung macrophages (Figure 3). PAR1 is expressed on both human and murine dendritic cells and its activation induces the release of MCP-1, IL-10, and IL-12 from these cells [65]. Moreover, PAR1 signaling on dendritic cells has been shown to sustain a lethal LPS-induced inflammatory response in mice [66]. In our study, we also observed a significant reduction in dendritic cells present in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice compared to untreated hMPV-infected mice. Activation of PAR1 on human T cells induces the secretion of IL-6 [67] and may have an effect on T cell receptor signaling [68]. In addition, T cell migration to the liver of PAR1-deficient mice was reduced by 70% in a model of liver fibrosis, suggesting a role for PAR1 in T cell migration [69]. We did not observe a significant difference in CD4+ T lymphocytes between any of the groups, yet significantly less CD4- T-lymphocytes were found in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice. It remains to be confirmed, however, whether these CD4- lymphocytes represent cytolytic T lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Immunomodulation, as a therapy, offers several advantages over conventional antiviral strategies. Because the host is the target of such a therapy, immunomodulation avoids the selective pressure on the pathogen that leads to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, because of the non-specific nature of the innate immune system, its modulation could result in broad-spectrum protection against a wide range of microbial pathogens. The use of immunomodulators for viral infections has been most extensively investigated for chronic infections such as HIV and viral hepatitis infections and some of these agents like interferon are in clinical use [70]. With the advent of severe respiratory distress syndromes due to A/H5N1 avian influenza and SARS-coronavirus infections and in particular since the 2009 influenza pandemic, the interest for immunomodulators in acute viral infections has been increasing. Several anti-inflammatory therapies for influenza A infections have been evaluated so far, including sphingosine analogues, NF-\u03baB inhibitors, antimicrobial peptides, COX-2 inhibitors and macrolides [71\u201373]. The latter are antibiotics with known anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that have shown promising results in several viral respiratory infections caused by influenza A, rhinovirus and hRSV [74]. Like macrolides, PAR1 antagonists may have a broad spectrum of activity. Indeed, Khoufache et al. recently reported results similar to ours in murine models of influenza A infections including those caused by A/H5N1 and oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) pdm09 strains [44]. In addition, unpublished data from our group indicates that PAR1 antagonists can significantly decrease hRSV lung titers and key pulmonary cytokines (IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES) in a similar mouse model highlighting the broad-spectrum potential of these compounds.",

            "text": "We found that PAR1 antagonist-treated and infected mice had reduced pulmonary viral titers on day 5 pi. This observation suggests a direct or indirect effect of PAR1 on viral replication. Such direct antiviral effect was not observed in our in vitro cell culture experiments, although testing was limited by cytotoxicity so that we cannot completely rule out a direct antiviral effect. On the other hand, viral entry into the host cell is mediated by the hMPV F surface glycoprotein. This protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein that requires proteolytic cleavage to become active [75]. The cleavage motif of the HMPV F protein at RSQR\u2193FV contains a minimal furin cleavage site, i.e., RXXR\u2193 present in many of its in vivo substrates [76,77]. Even though cleavage of the HMPV F protein requires the addition of trypsin in vitro, other enzymes could be involved in activating the F protein in vivo. Indeed, we found furin expression levels to be significantly increased in the lungs of hMPV-infected mice compared to mock-infected mice. In addition, using an in vitro cleavage assay, we clearly showed for the first time that, of all tested proprotein convertases, only furin was capable of cleaving the hMPV F precursor protein. Moreover, expression of recombinant human PAR1 (rhPAR1) reduced F protein cleavage in this assay; whereas treatment of rhPAR1 expressing cells with the PAR1 agonist restored F protein cleavage, treatment with the PAR1 antagonist did not. Since activation of PAR1 quickly initiates the internalization and degradation of the receptor [78] we hypothesize that the presence of unactivated PAR1 at the cell surface inhibits furin-mediated F protein cleavage. These in vitro observations could, at least partly, explain the slight reduction in viral titers observed in the lungs of hMPV-infected, PAR1 antagonist-treated mice. Considering that endogenous activators of PAR1 are present during in vivo infection, the inhibition of PAR1 activation with the PAR1 antagonist and the subsequent inhibition of PAR1 internalization and degradation could lead to reduced F cleavage and could therefore contribute to decreased hMPV infectivity. Taken together, these data suggest that furin levels and/or activity could have an effect on hMPV infectivity. On a similar note, PAR1 antagonists have been shown to decrease the plasmin-mediated cleavage of the influenza hemagglutinin protein with subsequent reduction in mouse lung viral titers [44]. Although PAR1 modulation of furin levels and/or activity and their subsequent effect on viral infectivity could offer a possible explanation for the reduced viral titers observed in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice, it needs to be confirmed that PAR1 inhibition can reduce the infectivity of other hMPV strains as well. Of interest, replication of several paramyxoviruses is furin-dependent, and this immunomodulatory approach may thus be beneficial not only for hMPV, but for other paramyxovirus infections as well.",

The protective mechanisms conferred by PAR1 antagonists are mediated by a modulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses, and also possibly through a reduction of viral infectivity. Different PAR1 antagonists appear to confer different protection levels during hMPV infection, warranting the evaluation of other PAR1 inhibitors and, importantly, the assessment of delayed treatment on clinical outcome. Importantly, some PAR1 inhibitors are already in clinical trials for other indications, which could accelerate the development of these compounds in the context of acute treatment of viral infections.",

Significant differences in furin transcript levels were observed between treated and untreated mice based on a Student T-test (* p=0.05, ** p<0.01) B) COS-1 and HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding the hMPV F protein containing a V5-tag and a plasmid encoding one of the proprotein convertases. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using a V5 mAb. Furin is the only convertase capable of cleaving the full length precursor protein (F0) into its activated form, resulting in the shorter C-terminal subunit (F1). C) Recombinant human PAR1 and furin are co-tranfected with the hMPV F protein containing a V5-tag in HEK293 cells with/without hPAR1 agonist, (100 \u03bcM) or antagonist (0.1 \u03bcM). Western blot analysis of cell lysates using an anti-V5 mAb is shown.",
