            "text": "Control of infectious agents is a major challenge in the homeostasis maintenance of organisms. Among vertebrates, interferons (IFNs) are the most important cytokines aimed to restrict viral replication and spread. IFNs induce the expression of numerous proteins that are responsible for their antiviral activities. The 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway is one of the best-characterized IFN effector pathways [1]. This tightly regulated antiviral pathway operates by controlling RNA integrity. Triggering of the OAS/RNase L pathway depends on the production of dsRNA, a by-product of viral replication [2]. Viral dsRNA stimulates OAS enzymes to catalyze the conversion of ATP into 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylates (2\u20135A) [3]. Newly produced 2\u20135A function as direct activators of the latent inactive RNase L [4]. 2\u20135A binding on the N-terminal ankyrin domain of the monomeric enzyme induces its oligomerization and activation [5], [6]. Enzymatically active RNase L subsequently cleaves single-stranded regions of viral and cellular RNA, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis, decreased viral replication and ultimately cell apoptosis. Moreover, RNase L was reported to be involved in amplification of IFN signaling [7]. Antiviral activity of the OAS/RNase L pathway was demonstrated for a wide variety of viruses including Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [8], Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) [9], [10], Vaccinia virus (VV) [11], Coxsackie B4 virus [12], West Nile virus [13] and Coronaviruses [14], [15].",

            "text": "DNA and RNA viruses evolved different strategies to counteract RNase L activity. For example, IFN-resistant genotypes of Hepatitis C virus (HCV), accumulated fewer RNase L cleavage sites as compared to IFN-sensitive HCV genotypes [16], [17]. Poliovirus delays RNase L activation by bearing a cleavage-resistant RNA sequence that interferes with endoribonuclease activity [18], [19]. EMCV was shown to upregulate the expression of RLI, a cellular protein that antagonizes 2\u20135A binding and RNase L activation [20]. The product of gene 7 of the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a swine coronavirus, was shown to be responsible for the inhibition of cellular RNA degradation. It is suggested that a complex comprising the gene 7 product and the cellular phosphatase PP1c is responsible for RNase L inhibition through 2\u20135A dephosphorylation [14]. More recently, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was shown to encode a phosphodiesterase which cleaves 2\u20135A [15]. RNase L antagonism was also reported for DNA viruses including HSV, SV40 and VV, via the production of inactive 2\u20135A analogs during infection. However, the identity of these 2\u20135A related compounds and the mechanism of their production are unknown [21]\u2013[24]. Interestingly, RNase L germline mutations have been associated with increased risks of prostate cancer as well as head and neck, uterine cervix and breast cancer [25], [26].",

            "text": "Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV or Theiler's virus), a member of genus Cardiovirus within the Picornaviridae family, is a natural pathogen of mice displaying a rare incidence of spontaneous neuro-invasion [27]. Persistent strains of Theiler's virus are responsible for a biphasic CNS infection. After initial replication of the virus in gray matter of the brain, the virus migrates to the spinal cord white matter where it mainly infects macrophages and oligodendrocytes [28], [29]. In the spinal cord, the virus persists lifelong in spite of a strong innate and adaptive immune response and triggers a chronic demyelinating disease reminiscent of human multiple sclerosis [30], [31]. Viral persistence and subsequent demyelination require the expression of L*, a 156 aminoacid-long viral accessory protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame (ORF) that overlaps the main viral ORF [32]\u2013[34]. Mechanisms used by L* to promote viral persistence remain poorly understood. L* was shown to drive sustained TMEV replication in macrophage cell lines [35], [36]. This effect was shown to be specific to macrophages and was not observed in other cell types, such as neurons or fibroblasts [37]. Facilitation of TMEV replication in macrophages is probably significant for TMEV persistence in vivo, as these cells bear the major viral load during chronic infection [28]. Increased viral replication in macrophages was reported to result from anti-apoptotic activity [32], [38].",

Since mitochondrial localization fitted well with the reported anti-apoptotic role of L*, we tested whether L* anti-apoptotic activity was responsible for the observed facilitation of viral replication in macrophages. We observed very little if any activity of L* on apoptosis, but a prominent inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway. Our work elucidated an important function of the L* protein. We show that L* antagonizes RNase L activity through a direct protein-protein interaction. This is the first example of viral protein acting at the effector step of this pathway.

These mutations were previously shown to affect L* protein production and the establishment of persistent CNS infections by Theiler's virus [34]. As expected, replication of the wild-type virus, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, exceeded that of the mutant viruses. The difference between wild-type and mutant virus replication was about 2-fold at 6 hours post-infection and rose over time to reach about 40-fold at 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, infectious virus yield, quantified by plaque assay, was one log higher in the case of the wild-type virus (Fig. 1B\u2013C). Yet, TUNEL staining of infected cells and caspase 3/7 assays failed to show any reproducible influence of L* on J774-1 cell apoptosis (Fig. 1D and S1). These observations suggested that apoptosis was not directly linked to the impaired replication of L*-mutant viruses in macrophage cell lines. Interestingly, we noticed that cellular RNA isolated from cells infected with the L*-mutant viruses exhibited extensive degradation, in contrast to RNA isolated from cells infected with the wild-type virus or from mock-infected cells (Fig. 1E). These data suggested that L* inhibits a cellular ribonuclease (RNase) activated following virus infection. We hypothesized that this RNase was RNase L, an effector of the IFN response [40].",

In this case, RNase L antagonism involved a cleavage-resistant RNA structure formed by the 3C-coding region of the poliovirus genome, that competitively inhibits RNase L activity [19]. We thus tested, in the case of TMEV, whether inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway observed in cells expressing L* was due to the expression of L*-coding RNA or to the L* protein itself. To this end, we constructed retroviral vectors encoding either a N-terminally HA-tagged L* or a frameshifted HA-L* obtained by deleting a single guanine nucleotide in the first codon of the construct. The presence of the N-terminal HA tag thus allowed to introduce the frameshift without modifying the RNA sequence in the L* moiety of the construct. Cells expressing equivalent levels of the two constructs were generated and incubated in presence of IFN-\u03b2 to induce sufficient expression of the OAS enzymes. Then, RNA degradation was assessed 7 hours after poly(I:C) transfection. As shown in Fig. 4, RNA was protected from degradation in cells expressing HA-L* (lane 6), but not in control cells (lane 2) or in cells expressing the frameshifted HA-L* (lane 8).

            "text": "The above data led us to hypothesize that RNase L could be inactivated through its association with L*. Because of the absence of reliable anti-murine RNase L antibodies and of tagged RNase L clones, we cloned the murine RNase L from SJL/J brain cDNA (Genbank accession JX443419) and verified that the cloned RNase L was catalytically active and 2\u20135A-dependent (data not shown). We next introduced a N-terminal FLAG tag in the construct and also tested its activity. We also constructed a TMEV recombinant virus, called FS96, expressing a N-terminally HA-tagged L* protein (HA-L*) and verified that the HA-tagged virus conserved the ability to persist in the CNS of susceptible mice and, hence, that the tag did not affect the function of L* in vivo (Fig. S5). Next, a derivative of this virus, called FS97, carrying a capsid adapted to infect L929 cells [42] was used in coimmunoprecipitation experiments to assess the interaction of L* and RNase L in infected cells. L929 cells constitutively expressing the FLAG-muRNase L protein were generated by means of a lentiviral vector. These cells were infected for 16 h with FS97 (HA-L*) and total cells lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 5). Western blot analysis of total cell lysates confirmed the expression of the expected proteins (Fig. 5B). When FLAG-muRNase L was immunoprecipitated from FS97-infected cells, a signal corresponding to the HA-L* protein was detected by immunoblot (Fig. 5A, lane 1). In the reciprocal experiment where HA-L* was pulled down, FLAG-muRNase L was detected in the immunoprecipitated complexes (Fig. 5A, lane 2). Control immunoprecipitations conducted either from FLAG-muRNase L-expressing cells infected with the parental KJ6 (L* WT) virus or from naive L929 cells infected with FS97 (HA-L*) failed to show co-immunoprecipitation of L* and RNase L (Fig. 5A, lanes 3\u20134 and 5\u20136). These results show that TMEV L* protein associates with murine RNase L in virus-infected cells.",

Two plasmid vectors encoding chimeric FLAG-tagged RNase L proteins were constructed (Fig. 6C). The first encodes the N-terminal part (amino acids 1\u2013400) of human RNase L followed by the C-terminal part of the murine RNase L (Nhu-Cmu) while the second encodes converse chimera (Nmu-Chu). Coimmunoprecipitation between HA-L* and the FLAG-tagged chimeric RNase L were conducted in transfected 293/T cells. As shown, in Fig. 6D, L* interacted with the Nmu-Chu but not with the Nhu-Cmu construct, suggesting that L* interacts with the N-terminal part (ankyrin domain) of murine RNase L.",

In the second case (adapter hypothesis), the lack of inhibition of huRNase L by L* would result from the inability of L* to bind the human adapter (Fig. 7A). Thus, when expressed in human cells, muRNaseL would be inhibited by L* in the case of direct but not in the case of indirect interaction, since these cells express the human adapter. As shown in Fig. 7B, L* expression clearly inhibited the activity of wild-type and of FLAG-tagged murine RNase L in human cells.

            "text": "L* is an atypical picornavirus protein in that it is translated from an alternative ORF overlapping the ORF encoding the viral polyprotein. This \u201caccessory\u201d protein is important for the establishment of persistent CNS infections by TMEV [32], [34]. Given that a fraction of this protein is targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane [39], [44], we aimed to confirm the anti-apoptotic role reported for L* in macrophages. Our data confirm the requirement of L* for virus growth in macrophages [35], [36], [45]. However, in contrast to previous reports [32], [38], our data revealed only marginal anti-apoptotic activity for L* in many different experimental settings. For instance, we failed to detect increased apoptosis in P388-D1, RAW264.7 or J774-1 macrophages infected with the L* mutant viruses. Also, ectopic expression of L* in J774-1 or RAW264.7 cells did not decrease apoptosis after treatment of the cells with apoptosis-inducing stimuli such as ultraviolet light, etoposide, hydrogen peroxyde, staurosporine or viral infection. In contrast, our data show a prominent role of L* in suppression of RNase L activity. Both in J774-1 cells and in primary macrophages from wild-type mice, replication of L*-mutants was significantly reduced as compared to that of the wild-type virus. In contrast, in RNase L\u2212/\u2212 primary macrophages, L*-mutant viruses replicated to wild-type levels. Moreover, in RNase L+/+ macrophages, ectopic expression of L* restored replication of mutant viruses to wild-type levels. Taken together, these data suggest that RNase L activity is a major cause of L*-mutant virus replication inhibition in macrophages and that ectopic expression of L* allows to rescue the replication of mutant viruses, through RNase L antagonism. Interestingly, antagonism of RNase L by L* was not restricted to macrophages but occurred in other cell types after priming of these cells with IFN. Accordingly, macrophages turned out to have elevated basal OAS expression levels as compared to fibroblasts but, after IFN treatment, OAS expression was upregulated in fibroblasts and replication of the L*-mutant viruses was also restricted in these cells.",

This was confirmed in an in vitro assay in the absence of any other viral or cellular protein. L* appears to interact with the ankyrin domain of RNase L. Structural data suggest that 2\u20135A binding to ankyrin repeats triggers the dimerization, and further the oligomerization, process that leads to RNase L activation [6]. By binding the ankyrin domain, L* could either inhibit 2\u20135A binding to RNase L or prevent the dimerization that was shown to occur during activation of the endoribonuclease [4], [6], [50]. Further experiments, including precise mapping of the interaction site are needed to gain insights in the molecular mechanisms engaged by L* to inhibit RNase L activation.",

Proteins like influenza A NS1 are believed to act by sequestering dsRNA and therefore by preventing OAS enzyme activation [51]. By acting upstream of the pathway, such proteins have a broader spectrum of action. Indeed, hiding dsRNA is also expected to prevent other events triggered by dsRNA, such as the activation of PKR or of the RIG-like helicases. L* acts at the opposite end of the pathway. The advantage of targeting the effector enzyme is that leakiness of the system is less likely. Accordingly, the antagonism of RNase L by L* looked very potent. Moderate levels of L* expression from retroviral vectors completely inhibited RNA degradation in infected cells or in cells transfected with 2\u20135A. The fact that Theiler's virus devotes a protein to antagonize the RNase L effector suggests that this specific pathway is particularly important in the control of Theiler's virus infection.",

L* inhibited the activity of murine but not of human, equine, canine porcine, bovine, guinea pig or chicken RNase L. Saffold virus is a recently discovered human virus closely related to TMEV [52]\u2013[54]. The numerous isolates of this virus sequenced to date lack the L* coding region and thus likely fail to inhibit RNase L activity by this mechanism. This suggests that RNase L is either a more critical IFN effector in mice than in humans, or that RNase L activity is particularly prominent in specific cell types that are infected by TMEV more than by Saffold virus. In this respect, it is interesting to note that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was recently shown to interfere with RNase L activation in macrophages by triggering the cleavage of 2\u20135A with a virally-encoded 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase [15]. TMEV and MHV share a marked tropism for macrophages. It is thus tempting to speculate that the antiviral activity of RNase L is particularly prominent in macrophages which fits with the observation that these cells contain higher basal levels of OAS enzymes and likely mount a faster and more potent RNase L response than other cells.",

Viruses were derived from the DA1 molecular clone (Genbank accession JX443418). A recombinant TMEV cDNA, named pFS96, was constructed, carrying the extra sequence coding for the HA epitope at the N-terminus of L*: 5\u2032 GGT ACC CGT ACG ACG TTC CGG ACT ACG CGC TGC TTG TAA GCA CGG 3\u2032, between nucleotides 1081 and 1082 of pTMDA1. The corresponding virus, FS96, produced by reverse genetics gave titers and plaque sizes similar to those of the parental DA1 virus (DA1: 7.6 107 PFU/ml; FS96: 6.4 107 PFU/ml). DA1 mutants carrying stop codon mutations in L* were described previously. In these viruses, mutations L* 1\u201312 (virus OV84) and L* 1\u201392 (virus OV42) prevented the expression of full-length L* protein but failed to affect the translation of the main viral open reading frame encoding the polyprotein. Both mutations affected the ability of the virus to establish persistent infections of the mouse CNS [34]. For L929 cell infection, DA1 derivatives carrying capsid mutation that enhance L929 cell infection were used [42]. These viruses, KJ6 (L* WT), FS57 (L* 1\u201392), and FS97 (HA-L*) were generally used at a MOI of 2 PFU per cell as this MOI usually yields almost 100% of infection [42]. In L929 cells infected with these viruses, cytopathic effect becomes visible from 6 hours post-infection. However, viral replication was found to peak in these cells between 12 and 20 h post-infection. For macrophage infection, derivatives carrying a macrophage-adapted capsid (mutations VP2 G162S, VP1 V256E and VP1 S257Y) were used: VV18 (L* WT), TM770 (L* 1\u201392) and FS58 (L* 1\u201312). These viruses were further purified as follows: SDS was added to viral stocks (BHK-21 cell supernatants) to a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 1000\u00d7 g and viruses were pelleted by centrifugation at 80,000\u00d7 g for 14 h at 20\u00b0C. Viruses were resuspended in 300 \u00b5l of Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 7.5 and centrifuged at 96,000\u00d7 g for 18 h at 4\u00b0C, through a 30% sucrose cushion. Viruses were resuspended in 300 \u00b5l Tris-HCl, 10 mM pH 7.5, dialyzed against the same buffer using Slide-A-Lyser Dialysis Cassette 10,000 MWCO (Pierce) and titrated on BHK-21 cells by plaque assay. For macrophage infection, viruses were typically used at a MOI of 20 PFU per cell to reach near 100% infection and viral replication was assessed between 6 and 12 hours post-infection, before extensive cell degradation.",
