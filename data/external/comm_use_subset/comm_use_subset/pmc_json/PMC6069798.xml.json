EV71 was first isolated in California, USA [1]. Subsequently, EV71-associated hand-foot- mouse disease (HFMD) outbreaks occurred around the world [2\u20137]. Clinical manifestations of EV71 infection range from mild HFMD to severe encephalitis, pulmonary edema, and even death [8, 9]. In recent years, EV71 was reported to cause several large-scale outbreaks of severe complications in children involving the central nervous system, resulting in fatalities [10, 11]. EV71 caused 126 deaths in 2008 in China [12, 13] and the largest outbreak in China occurred in 2010, with an estimated 1.7 million infections, of which 27,000 caused severe neurological complications, resulting in 905 fatalities [14]. Fatal cases were also reported in Asia as recently as 2012 [13].",

In addition, some compounds, such as rupintrivir [18, 19], showed activity against EV71 in both cell lines and animal models; however, clinical applications are not yet available, therefore more efforts are needed to develop drugs to conquer EV71 infections.",

Proteases play essential roles in the enteroviral life cycle. The virus polyprotein is co- and post-translationally processed by the viral proteases 2Apro, 3Cpro, and 3CDpro, the latter being the precursor of 3Cpro and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, 3Dpol. The first cleavage reaction in all enteroviral polyproteins is catalyzed by the 2Apro. These key viral proteases are the most prominent targets for consideration for development of antiviral agents [9, 21].",

Determination of cell viability 48 h after viral infection indicated that the inhibitory effect of quercetin on EV71 may result from the inhibition of viral replication in cells when the compound was also absorbed into cells, rather than only by inhibition of virus adsorption. Therefore, we performed an adsorption inhibition assay using intracellular virus titrations via the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) method. RD cells were infected with EV71 (100 and 1000 TCID50) and treated with 40 and 80 \u03bcM quercetin.

As illustrated in Fig. 2c, 80 \u03bcM quercetin decreased the virus titer significantly during virus attachment, with no apparent reduction when 40 \u03bcM quercetin was added.

A flexible surface loop \u03b2-ribbon is important for recognition of the P2\u2013P4 region of the peptide substrate. The stabilization of the open \u03b2-ribbon conformation requires intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, formed by Gly1-Gln168, Tyr122-Phe113, Gln121-Ser111, and a hydrophobic patch generated by interaction between Leu25 and Pro131, and Met109, Met112, Val114, and Phe140 [34]. To predict the interaction between EV71 3Cpro and quercetin, we tested the possible interaction and calculated the binding energy by molecular docking. We initially identified putative sites through which quercetin might bind to 3Cpro (Protein Data Bank [PDB] no. 3OSY) using this method. The binding free energy was calculated (Table 2) and the optimal value, indicating a site most likely to mediate interaction of quercetin with 3Cpro, was chosen (Fig. 6). The results illustrate that quercetin is predicted to bind stably in the substrate recognition region (P2\u2013P4) mainly through hydrogen bonds formed by residue Gly164 and hydrophobic interactions formed by residues Try138, Phe140, Ala144, His161, Ile162, Gly163, Gln168, Gly169 and Phe170 in 3Cpro (Fig. 6a).

A major limitation of these assays is their inability to discriminate between drug toxicity and viral-induced CPE. Moreover, reporter virus-based assays are only suitable for determining the antiviral activity of non-toxic compounds, since toxic compounds decrease the fluorescence or luminescence signal. Thus, the EV71 antiviral assay used in this study was conducted by combining these two approaches. Moreover, EC50 values of quercetin against EV71 were also obtained by other approaches, including CPE microscopy and classic virus yield reduction assay (data not shown), in addition to the two assays described above. GFP reporter infection assays, using a full-length infectious clone, allowed screening for inhibitors of any step(s) of the replication cycle of EV71. CPE detection, MTT and virus yield assays reflected changes in cellular phenotypes, metabolism, and viral multiplication, respectively. The similarity of the EC50s obtained using these different approaches suggested that quercetin alone did not inhibit cell growth and could effectively inhibit viral infection.",

The value of CC50 for quercetin was > 200 \u03bcM, which was the same as the positive control, ribavirin.

            "text": "An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) required for viral protein translation is a potential EV71 drug target. As previously reported, several flavonoids, including kaempferol and hesperetin, exhibit antiviral activity against EV71 through inhibition of the IRES; however, quercetin does not inhibit IRES-driven translation [29]. Another dietary flavonoid, apigenin, suppresses EV71 replication through a novel mechanism by targeting trans-acting factors [28]. The results of this study demonstrated that quercetin was able to effectively inhibit EV71 replication by inhibition of the activity of the virus-encoded 3Cpro, and the results verified that flavonoids with similar structures exert different mechanisms against EV71. Further study of the affinity of quercetin for 3Cpro is warranted to ascertain whether the compound affects other viral or cellular functions crucial for EV71 replication.",

It has also been reported that 3Cpro can impair host RNA processing and polyadenylation by cleavage of the cellular CstF-64 protein, leading to enhanced viral RNA replication [7]. The 3C protein can also trigger apoptosis through the caspase pathway in neuronal cells [42]. In this study, treatment of infected cells with quercetin reduced yields of viral RNA and inhibited EV71-induced apoptosis. These results led us to conclude that the inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and EV71-induced apoptosis in RD cells by quercetin was the result of its inhibition of viral 3Cpro activity.",

Quercetin has also been identified as a potent inhibitor of reverse transcriptases from rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [44]. In this study, quercetin significantly inhibited the activity of 3Cpro of EV71. Further, we predicted the interaction between EV71 3Cpro and quercetin and calculated the binding energy using molecular docking. Docking calculations between 3Cpro and other flavonoids have been reported previously, and the accurate prediction of biomolecular conformation and binding energies of protein-ligand complexes exhibited similarities, including common binding sites Leu4, Leu8, Ser111, Met112, Phe113, and Pro115 [45, 46]. The amino acid sites predicted to be involved in 3Cpro-quercetin complexes included Met0, Arg4, Pro5, Ser111, Met112, Phe113, Leu4, Thr101, Pro115 (rank 1 and rank 2 in Table 2). Although these amino acid sites were explored for important roles in the interaction between EV71 3Cpro and other flavonoids (or its phosphate ester), they have not been identified as involved in biological catalysis to date. Analysis of the 3Cpro-quercetin interaction revealed that quercetin interacted with the 3Cpro catalytic residues, His40, Glu71 and Cys147 (rank 7 and rank 8 in Table 2), which is different to other flavonoids, this binding may decrease EV71 3Cpro activity. Moreover, for the initial manner of binding, predicted by the docking results (rank 0 in Table 2), quercetin was predicted to interact with numerous residues in 3Cpro, including Tyr138, Phe140, Ala144, His161, Ile162, Gly163, Gly164, Gln168, Gly169, and Phe170. The molecular binding model of the 3Cpro-quercetin complex revealed that quercetin may stably insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3Cpro via numerous hydrogen bond interactions. Similar binding mechanisms have been reported for the interactions between flavonoids and 3CLpro in SARS-CoV [43], but not EV71. Therefore, these modes of interaction between different flavonoids and various viruses could be used as a reference for the design of 3Cpro inhibitors.",
