These problems include temporary teething discomfort, trauma to the teeth and supporting structures, and early childhood caries [2]. Caries, despite recent preventive regimes and advanced early diagnosis methods, remains a prevalent childhood disease around the world. In fact, dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children [3]. In the US, 1 in every 4 children between 2 and 5 years of age has had caries in the primary teeth [4]. The prevalence of caries is also high in most Arabi countries including Saudi Arabia [5, 6]. In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of caries was estimated to be 73% [7], and a meta-analysis by Khan et al. found a mean decayed, missing, filled teeth (dmft) score due to caries of 5.38 in primary dentition [8].",

Evaluating and describing these influences can aid dentists in assessing children\u2019s oral health needs [11, 24, 25, 30, 37], providing better oral health care services [11, 24, 26, 31], and improving the oral health outcomes of children [11, 22]. Although assessment of OHRQoL is well established in adults following several decades of use, its application in children is relatively new and less understood. Prior to Pahel et al\u2019s development of ECOHIS [22], the first documented child-specific OHRQoL scale was presented by Jokovic et al. in 2002 to assess the impact of oral conditions on QoL in children 11 to 14 years of age [38]. Proper translation and validation are important for cross-cultural adaptation of QoL questionnaires [24\u201326, 39] and also enable comparisons between different countries using the same measurement instrument [24\u201326, 31, 40]. The ECOHIS questionnaire has so far been translated into French [23], Chinese [25], Farsi [30], Turkish [31], Brazilian Portuguese [24, 27], Spanish [26], Lithuanian [29], and Malay [28]. In this study, the ECOHIS was translated into the Arabic language, and its psychometric properties were tested.",

Similar to some studies [23\u201325, 29, 31], caregivers feeling upset was the most frequently reported item in the family section in this study. Taking time off work [22] and feeling guilty [27, 28] were the most commonly reported family impacts in three other studies.

Unexpectedly, caregivers who reported good general oral health had slightly higher A-ECOHIS scores than did those who reported it to be fair. This could have been due to the subjectivity of the options, especially in two consecutive categories. Overall, there was a significant correlation between the global question and each of the total, child and family A-ECOHIS scores, as reported in other validation studies [22\u201324, 30, 31]. The Spearman correlation coefficient that we calculated for the total A-ECOHIS score with the global question was higher than that reported in the French study (\u22120.20) [23], but not the Turkish (0.68) [31] or Lithuanian (0.72) [29] studies.",

Missing responses in this study of the A-ECOHIS were infrequent, ranging from 0.2 to 5.5% in the community sample and not exceeding 2.8% in the clinic sample, which is less than what was reported previously [41]. This is a good indication of the comprehensibility and relevance of the A-ECOHIS items [23]. Adding \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d options to questionnaires helps subjects answer questions thereby avoiding missing data [23]. Nevertheless, some of our respondents left some questions blank. The highest percentages of missing values were in the \u201cfinancial impact\u201d (5.5%) and \u201ctaking time off work\u201d (4.7%) questions. It is possible that some of the caregivers were mothers unemployed outside of the home who did not have a full picture of the spouse\u2019s work status or the family\u2019s financial situation. Additionally, respondents may have felt embarrassed by or unwilling to expose their financial difficulties. Indeed, only a small percentage of subjects reported not having enough money, although it seems reasonable to assume that most of the patients who choose to visit the free clinics of King Abdulaziz University are financially insecure. The \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d responses did not exceed 0.2% of the community-based sample and ranged from 0.8 to 2.1% of the clinic-based sample. This was much lower than the response rate for \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d in the original study [22], and the French [23] and the Brazilian [24] validation studies.",
