On the other hand, the introduction of molecular diagnostic methods has significantly improved the epidemiological investigation of viral pneumonia in the ICU in recent years with increased potential for detection of a wide array of viruses. In fact, in recent studies, viruses accounted for 20\u201350% of total infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe respiratory distress [1\u20134]. In addition, the emergence of new respiratory viruses such as human coronavirus (hCoV) SARS, hCoV-MERS and influenza A/H1N1pdm09, has further underscored the role of viruses in severe respiratory infections. Still, the role of viral agents other than influenza such as rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134 (hPIV1-4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hCoV which are frequently detected in respiratory samples of ICU patients, is not fully appreciated [1,2].",

In general, the emergence of inherently more virulent viruses during the course of a given season should not be overlooked [6]; while, different host factors responsible for the severe outcome of influenza infection have been suggested (i.e. pregnancy and obesity) [7]. More specifically as observed during the 2009 influenza virus (A/H1N1pdm09) pandemic, only a few genetic changes may increase transmissibility, replicative efficiency and tissue tropism range [8\u201312]. For instance, single amino acid changes (222G/N) in the HA gene are associated with increased virus replication in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and worse clinical outcome [8\u201312]. However, it is still unclear how these mutations emerge, evolve, consolidate and/or disappear in the context of dynamic viral population changes during the infection.",

Diagnostic and clinical management of patients admitted to hospitals in the Lombardy Region with severe and moderate influenza like illness (ILI) included prospective influenza A detection, subtyping and sequencing. The latter two were centralized at two Regional Reference Laboratories. Mild respiratory infection specimens were collected by sentinel practitioners and anonymously analyzed at the reference laboratory in Milan, according to the National Surveillance Plan (Influnet). Informed consent for Influenza A genotyping was not required since patients with severe and mild ILI were included in the Regional diagnostic and clinical management protocol.

Interestingly, in almost 20% of these patients the viral load in the URT was undetectable in the presence of high viral load in the LRT. It is reasonable to hypothesize that in severe infections, the initial replication of influenza in the URT is followed by the spread of influenza in the LRT [23]. At ICU admission, usually several days after the onset of clinical symptoms, the clinical samples are collected for the laboratory diagnosis. At this moment, the influenza virus might have been already cleared from the URT by the immune system, while in the LRT the viral shedding persists[23]. Therefore, our findings underline the importance of appropriate sample collection, especially in patients with severe infection [23,24].",

Overall, a greater number of H1N1pdm09 virus variants were observed in the LRT, suggesting different viral kinetic patterns in the URT, as compared to LRT of patients with severe influenza infections. The 222G/N mutations known to be associated with increased clinical severity were observed in 30% of LTR samples of ICU patients. In URT samples (ICU and control patients) only the wild type 222D polymorphism was observed. The frequency of 222G/N changes was in keeping with our previous observations and other reports [8,10,17,29,30]. Although our data confirm the association between 222G/N mutations and disease severity, over 70% of ICU patients showed no specific HA mutations among viral populations in the lung. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that more than one virulence determinant is involved in severe influenza infections. Nevertheless, in these patients, comorbidities or per-existing host genetic factors may have contributed to disease severity [31].",

In keeping with this finding, in our series, 222G/N populations were observed only in LRT samples. Unfortunately, no information regarding the quasispecies population of the URT could be obtained due to low virus load. Viral diversity, evaluated in sequential LRT samples, showed several patterns of population evolution. On the basis of these findings and, due to the limited number of cases, no major conclusions can be drawn on viral population dynamic in the LRT.",
