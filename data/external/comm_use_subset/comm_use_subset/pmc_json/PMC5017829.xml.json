            "text": "Several international public health crises have emerged in recent years, including Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Zika virus. In addition to these novel threats, there has been a resurgence of previously nearly eradicated infectious diseases, including mumps. In recent years, the numbers of mumps cases in the United States has fluctuated from hundreds to thousands of cases per year. In 2006, a multi-state mumps outbreak in the Midwest consisted of over 6,500 cases. In 2009\u20132010, two large outbreaks occurred in New York City and Guam, affecting about 3,000 and 500 persons respectively. In 2011\u20132013, there were smaller outbreaks in several states.1 Many of the outbreaks occurred among college students. There was also a large outbreak in late 2014 among professional hockey players involving at least five teams in the National Hockey League (NHL), which began with players on the Anaheim Ducks. In March 2016, California public health officials issued an advisory noting that five college students at the University of San Diego had been diagnosed with mumps; this was followed by a subsequent advisory identifying three additional mumps cases in college students diagnosed in Orange County, California.2,3 In April 2016, a high profile outbreak reported at Harvard University and surrounding areas resulted in more than 40 cases of mumps in less than two months. As of May 5, 2016, nearly 80 cases were reported in the state of Massachusetts with 50 cases at Harvard.4 Over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2016, mumps cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been steadily increasing, from 370 in 2011 to 1,148 as of May 21, 2016.5 These cases and outbreaks as well as the potential decrease in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination uptake due to parental refusal underscore the importance of the emergency department (ED) as a primary location for identification and containment of public health threats. Patients frequently present to the ED with undifferentiated chief complaints, making rapid and accurate diagnosis challenging. Most contagious diseases that manifest with nonspecific influenza-like illness symptoms and signs will not ultimately be determined to be rare and deadly diseases like Ebola or MERS; however, they may be contagious and require immediate isolation. This underscores the need for emergency physicians to have the necessary information and tools to rapidly identify potential public health threats. While the mumps virus is typically mild and self-limited, it is highly contagious for susceptible patients when proper isolation and containment measures are not rapidly initiated; a single case can result in up to 12 secondary cases in a susceptible population.6 Infection can occur despite vaccination, and most cases seen in college outbreaks have occurred in fully vaccinated patients. Further, the mumps virus can sometimes have serious long-term sequelae including infertility/subfertility, central nervous system (CNS) infection, deafness, and severe pancreatitis. In rare cases, these complications can be fatal.7",

Mumps virus can be isolated from saliva, urine, blood, nasopharyngeal secretions, and seminal fluid.14, 15 The preferred definitive diagnostic test is a swab of the buccal mucosa using a viral culture swab for RT-PCR testing. Collection of the specimen in the first three days of parotitis is optimal, but virus can still be detected in some cases up to nine days after onset of parotitis. Clinicians should contact local or state public health authorities to arrange for testing, as testing at commercial laboratories may be unreliable. Serologic diagnosis of acute mumps infection by testing for IgM and IgG antibodies may be unreliable, as the IgM response may be attenuated or absent in vaccinated persons, and persons with detectable IgG titers can still develop mumps.16",

For patients with a history of exposure to the mumps virus, there is no clear evidence to support reduction of clinical disease severity through post-exposure MMR vaccination or immunoglobulin administration.7 Public health monitoring of asymptomatic patients for development of signs and symptoms is recommended. Each prior 3I tool (e.g., for Ebola, MERS, measles, and Zika) considered specific disease characteristics, and the algorithms were modified accordingly. For example, Ebola is not contagious from person to person prior to symptom onset, and therefore, no PPE or isolation would be indicated in an asymptomatic person.",

All healthcare providers, regardless of vaccination status, should wear a gown, gloves and a mask when caring for these patients. Isolation precautions should be continued for five days after the onset of parotid gland swelling to minimize risk of disease transmission. Laboratory specimens (serum, urine, nasopharyngeal secretions, semen) should be sent for confirmatory PCR and serologic testing.",
