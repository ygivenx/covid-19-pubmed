It remains a challenge to understand the mechanisms whereby viral persistence is established and maintained, especially viral persistence within a cell or group of cells. Mechanisms by which RNA virus persistence is initiated and maintained usually involve two virus-specific factors: the generation of defective interfering (DI) particles or temperature-sensitive mutation of wild-type virus [1,2]. Research suggests that host factors involved in the control of persistent infection relate to elements of innate immunity in Morbillivirus [3] and cellular protein synthesis in Reovirus [4].",

Mammalian cells have evolved many sophisticated signaling pathways to monitor any abnormality, including the accumulation of misfolded proteins; these pathways are known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) [5]. These signaling pathways monitor the ER\u2019s capacity to refold and/or remove abnormally folded proteins and to make cell-fate decisions according to the homeostatic balance [6,7]. In all known animal cells, the following are known to be activated to initiate the UPR: three ER-localized transmembrane UPR transducers, inositol requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) [8]. Under basal conditions, these three sensors are associated with immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP), also known as GRP78, which is a chaperone of the heat shock protein 70 family. Each branch operates parallel with a particular target downstream and contributes to both cell-protective and cell-death pathways [6,7]. Under severe or chronic ER stress, the UPR switches its mode of action toward apoptosis. C/EBP homologous binding protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153), is the pro-apoptotic transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating cell death after ER stress [9,10]. Several molecular mechanisms of CHOP-induced apoptosis have been cited, such as compromised alteration of Bcl-2 family proteins [11,12].",

West Nile virus modulates all three arms of the UPR and induces numerous apoptotic responses, including induction of CHOP expression [14]. Modulation of the UPR by the West Nile virus is regulated differentially along with its replication cycle [15]. Similar to other flaviviruses, the dengue virus also induces the three arms of the UPR and CHOP expression. However, activated CHOP does not induce its downstream apoptotic markers, such as suppression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3 or caspase-9 [16,17]. In addition, studies of the hepatitis C virus have shown that both viral structural (envelope) and non-structural (NS2) proteins can induce ER stress and the UPR activation with up-regulation of BiP and CHOP [18,19].",

            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the Flaviviridae, is the causative agent of encephalitis in humans and can be transmitted by persistently JEV-infected mosquitoes [20]. Viral persistence in the nervous systems of JEV-infected patients has been shown in approximately 5% of JEV cases, suggesting that JEV persistence may contribute to neural sequelae after acute infection [21]. Though JEV is usually cytolytic for susceptible cells, persistent infection of JEV has been established in various cell cultures, including baby hamster kidney (BHK)-21 [22-28] as well as in a mouse model [29]. The underlying mechanisms for JEV persistence in cultured cells are not clearly described. We have previously demonstrated spontaneous establishment of persistent JEV infection in BHK-21 cells via serial undiluted passages without any supplemental treatment [27]. Examples of supplemental treatment include Bcl-2 overexpression [26] or indirect infection with supernatants from persistently JEV-infected mosquito cells [30]. Our previous study suggested that DI particle accumulation and helper virus attenuation are possible mechanisms for the development and maintenance of JEV persistence in BHK-21 cells. Nonetheless, labile cellular factors that may play a role in JEV persistence have never been identified in this system. JEV also induces ER stress and the UPR, and studies suggest that the activation of the UPR is a major cause of JEV-induced apoptosis [31]. The UPR has never been assessed in JEV persistent infection, however.",

These cell clones seldom, if ever, undergo apoptosis, while JEV replicates actively within. We observed that there was no CHOP expression at any time, but a significant amount of BiP expression was constant in these cells. Knockdown of BiP expression resulted in CHOP induction and subsequent cell death. Because the level of JEV amplification in these cells was not low enough to hold an apoptotic process, we suggest that the readjustment of BiP expression in host cells could be one of key factors involved in cell fate decision under viral persistence.",

JEV infection induces severe cytopathic effects in various cell culture systems, including BHK-21 cells, and researchers have documented the ER stress response and subsequent apoptosis in the JEV-infected cells [31,32]. In order to assess how much of the JEV persistently infected BHK-21 cell population is destined to apoptosis while continuously producing infectious virus particles, the two BHK-21 cell clones with JEV persistent infection\u2014cBS6-2 and cBS6-3\u2014were subjected to flow cytometry analysis after annexin V/propidium iodide staining. The number of apoptotic cells and the late apoptotic or necrotic cells increased significantly upon wild-type JEV infection in normal BHK-21 cells (Figure 1A). On the contrary, the number of cBS6-2 or cBS6-3 cells with JEV persistent infection undergoing apoptosis seemed to remain below the basal level shown in the na\u00efve BHK-21 cells. The amount of intracellular infectious JEV particles produced in the persistently infected cells was 5- to 7-fold less than that of an acute infection (Figure 1B). All cells subjected to the flow cytometry were plated and analyzed at the same time points. The cells were grown under the same culture conditions, and no notable difference in the cell numbers of each population was observed.",

Based on these reports, this study primarily assessed the expression profile of the UPR factors in the BiP-PERK arm of the BHK-21 cells with JEV persistent infection. Normal BHK-21 cells were infected with JEV and harvested at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 hr post-infection (p.i.) in order to obtain cell lysates. Two JEV persistently infected BHK-21 cell clones, cBS6-2 and cBS6-3, were freshly seeded and harvested at their confluence on the culture flask; their cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting. Phosphorylation of PERK was gradually increased, peaked at 18 hr p.i., and decreased thereafter in acutely JEV-infected cells (Figure 2A). In persistently JEV-infected cells, however, there was only a minute amount of both PERK and p-PERK. Unlike PERK, the expression of eIF2\u03b1 in the persistently infected cells seemed enhanced, as shown in normal BHK-21 cells with JEV acute infection at 30\u201336 hr p.i.; however, the amount of p-eIF2\u03b1 was barely detectable (Figure 2A).",

CHOP, the key mediator of ER stress-induced apoptosis, was also induced and accumulated gradually along with the ATF4 activation. In contrast, for the JEV persistently infected cell clones, the expression of CHOP was not detected at all, even in the presence of ATF4 for its transcription (Figure 2A). Unlike cBS6-2, impaired expression of ATF4 in cBS6-3 was repeatedly noticed in several independent experiments.

Compared to the DMSO-treated control, both tunicamycin-treated normal BHK-21 cells and cBS6-2 cells showed PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 pathway activation followed by CHOP induction (Figure 2B). Most of the cells treated with tunicamycin, including cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 cells, succumbed to apoptotic cell death within 24 hr (data not shown). Although CHOP was also clearly induced, expression of p-PERK or ATF4 in cBS6-3 cells was not comparable to the normal BHK-21 cells or cBS6-2 cells on tunicamycin treatment for unknown reasons. This observation suggests that cBS6-3 cell clones may utilize another pathway to induce CHOP expression, perhaps involving IRE1 activation. These differences in the activation process of the BiP-PERK arm between cBS6-2 and cBS6-3 imply that individual cells comprising a cell batch with JEV persistent infection could have their own unique modification in cellular physiology to avoid the virus-induced apoptosis.",

These results are also consistent with a report noting that up-regulation of CHOP during JEV infection plays a key role in virus-induced apoptosis [31]. As infectious bronchitis virus-induced apoptosis was suppressed and virus replication inhibited in the CHOP-knockdown cells [36], the complete blockage of CHOP expression in cBS6-2 or cBS6-3 cells might intervene in JEV replication and therefore assist in the development of JEV persistent infection.
