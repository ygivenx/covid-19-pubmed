            "text": "RNA viruses alone include 350 different human pathogens. Most are the agents of newly emerging diseases. Recent concerns for actual or feared pandemics (SARS, avian flu, or swine flu viruses) all raised the challenge to quickly come up with solutions. Worldwide, over 100 million influenza cases occur each year, 170 million people carry HCV, and 33 million HIV. RNA viruses generally have very high mutation rates as they use polymerases which cannot find and fix mistakes, and are therefore unable to conduct genomic repair of damaged genetic material. Under selective pressure, this error-prone replication can confer drug resistance. Since AIDS appeared, many new drugs have been created and used against RNA viruses, which in turn readily evolved drug-resistant strains, a now predictable process and an unprecedented public health issue. HIV mutant strains that escape antiviral compounds have been extensively documented [1], and one of influenza's main treatments, tamiflu, was quickly escaped from by an influenza strain which then spread surprisingly fast across the planet [2]. It now becomes clearer that future antiviral strategies should address this issue from the outset, aggressively striving to prevent viral escape. To deal with this, several directions have been explored since a decade: the structures of resistant proteins [3], second generation drugs that can bind resistant proteins [4], drug target polymorphism analysis in order to define \"super drugs\" [5], definition of new targets, such as protein backbones [6] or dimeric proteins' monomers, in order to block them before dimerisation [7]. Overall, although individual case solutions were found, no general solution has emerged yet.",

The rationale is that mutations in invariant positions always damage a critical biological function, resulting in non-replicative viruses. For exemple, zanamivir is a broad inhibitor of neuraminidase, an influenza glycoprotein, probably because it interacts with invariant amino acids inside the enzyme active site [9]. Ceccherini et al. [10-12] identified new conserved residues for the HIV protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase, and mapped them on the 3D protein structure to help to design a new structure-based escape-resistant inhibitor.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, sometimes, invariant positions are too few to constitute a proper docking site for a drug. For example, 63% of the HIV protease amino acids are variable [13]. In an effort to gather enough replicativity-critical amino acids for a possible docking site, we propose to also target synthetic lethals (SL, or co-lethals). Synthetic lethality is the lethality resulting when two, individually survivable, mutations, are co-present [14]. Each mutation is then called a synthetic lethal. Analysis of SLs is a powerful tool to understand genetic interactions and essential metabolic pathways. Synthetic lethality has been extensively used to study gene products' interactions in the secretion pathway in yeast [15], in bacteria [16] and even to identify anticancer agents [17]. It was noticed that, in many cases, the double mutants identified had their co-lethal mutations in 2 different genes. A few yeast studies analyzed protein structure-function aspects, revealing intragenic synthetic lethals [18], i.e. cases where the 2 co-lethal mutations occur in one same gene. Little SL research has been undertaken on viruses. Researchers were rather on a quest for the opposite situation, where one crippling mutation is rescued by a second, intragenic, suppressor mutation, the second restoring the function lost due to the first mutation [19,20]. They also found few, under-represented intragenic suppressors, which actually turned out to be SLs.",

As mentioned above, the number of replicativity-critical amino acids available for drug docking should be maximized, invariant amino acids being not numerous enough, and one single SL couple being possibly too little. So we propose to add larger \"SL sets\" rather than one single SL couple. By \"SL set\", we mean a set of SL couples that are connected to each other. We choose to add also the invariant position being in the vicinity of the SL set. Indeed, a set of positions containing invariant amino acids plus an SL set may be large enough a target for putative antiviral drugs.",

This protein is a 99 amino acids homodimeric aspartic protease and its substrate-binding pocket includes the D25-T26-G27 catalytic triad and flap regions, which presumably open and close to allow entry and binding of substrates or inhibitors [22,23]. This protein has more than 60% of variant positions. We first aligned 24,155 amino acid sequences of the HIV protease. From this alignment, we determined all the couples of positions that were statistically never found mutated together, that we called SL and focused on the SL set, which are accessible to the solvent, and not too far apart spatially. We report here that our method has yielded 3 targets of respectively 4, 5 and 7 amino acids. Unlike currently documented drug targets, which mutate and escape drug treatments, these targets should be conserved, otherwise viral replicativity would suffer, impairing viral pathogenicity. More generally, this process can of course be used against other HIV proteins, other RNA viruses, or any highly variable agents.",

To do so, we analyzed, from patients, 24,155 protease amino acid sequences of HIV-1 subtype B. Some patients had been previously treated with antiviral drugs, and some never, so the pool of sequences more appropriately represents the actual viral diversity. We kept all the sequences in one same set for four different reasons. Firstly, an untreated patient can get a viral sequence - possibly highly mutated - from a treated patient. Secondly, treatment is a selection pressure but other pressures can select other mutations appearing in both treated and untreated sets. Thirdly, our dataset can be enriched with plenty of mutations from unknown patients with unknown treatment histories. Finally, we wanted to create a tool that is robust enough to be used on other RNA virus databases that are less documented than HIV. When sequences occurred in multiple copies in the sequences collection, we kept all these redundant copies, assuming redundancy may reflect biological fitness (mostly identical copies from different patients, rather than multiple samples from the same patient). We did not use clonal data because it is less informative: not enough sequences, and not mutated enough. These 24,155 sequences were aligned. From this alignment, we found 25 positions that display changes in less than 0,3% of the sequences. We called those positions \"invariants\". Ceccherini-Silberstein et al. [10], who defined invariant positions as displaying changes in less than 1% of the sequences, found 46 of those positions. All our 25 invariant positions were totally included in the Ceccherini-Silberstein invariant set of protease inhibitor (PI) treated patients. Stanford university HIV drug resistance database [13] described 36 positions represented in less than 0.5% of the HIV subtype B sequences from PI treated patients. Our 25 invariant positions are also all included in this group. The invariants positions were then set aside momentarily; and we compared the 74 variant positions in pairs (2,701 couples).",

The combination of SG-fulc1 plus SG-fulc2 is named SG-fulc. The names were given retrospectively, as reminders of 3 specific regions of the protease 3D structure [26,27]. Namely, SG-flap includes 3 positions found in the protease flaps. SG-canti includes positions found in the protease cantilever. And all positions of SG-fulc are in the protease fulcrum.

This set, (L10, T12, K14, L19, E21), called SGI-fulc, is therefore a good target for a putative drug (Figure 3c).

These synthetic lethals should not be mixed, since they're only usable targets in their relevant phylogenetic branch. In the case of HIV-1, they are three main branches are groups M, N and O. The branch of sub-group M is further divided in 7 sub-groups, including sub-group B. We choose to work on sub-group B because it has the more published sequences (over 20,000 for the protease) and mutations. Although there is no simple algorithm today to build a tree from tens of thousands of sequences, it would be interesting to study the phylogenic tree of our pool of sequences in parallel with our synthetic lethality study. However from an evolutionary point of view, we believe that the positive co-evolution of two sites (both positions always mutate together) is not the same issue as exclusive co-evolution (both positions can mutate but never together) Indeed, when examining the propagation of 2 mutated positions in a tree, two situations can be distinguished: either they are co-present in the majority of the sub-trees, which tends to indicate noise (since there is no segregation); or they are co-present only in the leaves of one part of the tree, which tends to indicate true co-evolution. Inversely, when studying a case of exclusive co-evolution, only one of these two situations is possible. Indeed, by definition of synthetic lethals, both mutations cannot be part of the same sub-tree since their co-presence is lethal. So the tree resulting from this situation is impossible to analyze, since one should analyze all the sub-trees in order to find the missing branches - which corresponds to the statistical study we conducted here.",

Our results indeed include cases where synthetic lethals were actually mutated (although this occurred in less 0.02%- 0.5% of the sequences, data not shown). So if these sequences truly represent replicative viruses, as opposed to unfiltered artifacts, then there is a risk that blocking some synthetic lethal couple with a new drug could create a selection bottleneck [39,40], forcing viral evolution towards more resistant strains. If such new escape mutants were to appear, they should carefully be monitored by sequencing at least their synthetic lethal positions, as a first step in further refining the antiviral strategy.",

We described here a method to identify targets that may be involved in essential viral functions. These are what we call locked targets: spatially close, accessible viral invariant positions and/or potential synthetic lethals (SLs are groups of survivable mutations which are lethal whenever any two co-occur). Due to these two features, vital function and invariance, these targets are unique in that they might minimize or prevent viral escape. Our application to the HIV protease yielded 3 locked targets that are accessible, compact enough to possibly dock a drug, and are all outside of the enzyme's active site; whereas to date, all 9 existing anti-protease drugs were competitive inhibitors that bind the active site. The first locked target we closed in on is made of 7 amino acids positioned between the protease flaps and cantilever. The second locked target we detected is made of 5 amino acids in the protease fulcrum. The third locked target is composed of 4 amino acids located in the protease cantilever region. These three locked targets altogether contain 16 protease amino acid positions. Biological evidence regarding 10 positions out of these 16, provided in the Results section supports that those 3 locked targets are strategic drug targets. This because it seems a virus cannot easily mutate these targets to escape, as our statistics significantly exclude free co-mutations within those targets. While our method made no a priori assumptions on the positions or sequence sets, it revealed locked targets that bear essential biologic functions, which validates the starting hypothesis linking SLs to essential biological functions.",

However, it appears impossible to execute the described experiments due to the number of sequences in our dataset (24151 sequences), and the idea of limiting the phylogenetic study to selected clusters is interesting. Still, from an evolutionary point of view, we believe that the positive co-evolution of two sites (both positions always mutate together) is not the same issue as exclusive co-evolution (both positions can mutate but never together) Indeed, when examining the propagation of 2 mutated positions in a tree, two situations can be distinguished: either they are co-present in the majority of the sub-trees, which tends to indicate noise (since there is no segregation); or they are co-present only in the leaves of one part of the tree, which tends to indicate true co-evolution. Inversely, when studying a case of exclusive co-evolution, only one of these two situations is possible. Indeed, by definition of synthetic lethals, both mutations cannot be part of the same sub-tree since their co-presence is lethal. So the tree resulting from this situation is impossible to analyze, since one should analyze all the sub-trees in order to find the missing branches - which corresponds to the statistical study we conducted here.",

But the mutations involved in resistance to anti-protease drugs do not follow the same rules.

Furthermore, from an evolutionary point of view, we believe that the positive co-evolution of two sites (both positions always mutate together) is not the same issue as exclusive co-evolution (both positions can mutate but never together) Indeed, when examining the propagation of 2 mutated positions in a tree, two situations can be distinguished: either they are co-present in the majority of the sub-trees, which tends to indicate noise (since there is no segregation); or they are co-present only in the leaves of one part of the tree, which tends to indicate true co-evolution. Inversely, when studying a case of exclusive co-evolution, only one of these two situations is possible. Indeed, by definition of synthetic lethals, both mutations cannot be part of the same sub-tree since their co-presence is lethal. So the tree resulting from this situation is impossible to analyze, since one should analyze all the sub-trees in order to find the missing branches - which corresponds to the statistical study we conducted here.",

The null hypothesis in this test is that the frequency with which both sites are mutated is the product of the frequencies with which individual sites are mutated. Any deviation from this null hypothesis, however small, can produce a significant result if the number of observations is sufficiently large. Thus, if site B is only slightly less likely to be mutated when site A has been mutated, the authors' procedure would predict that A and B are a synthetic lethal pair, even though the fitness cost of mutating both A and B may be minute.",

It is well known that phylogenetic relationships can produce apparent non-independence of sites. Methods to control for this effect exist and could be used in place of the authors' method, see e.g. Noivirt O, Eisenstein M, Horovitz A. (2005) Detection and reduction of evolutionary noise in correlated mutation analysis. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 18, 247-253. The authors argue that their data set is too large to control for phylogeny.
