            "text": "Chikungunya virus is a member of the genus Alphavirus, which are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. It was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952, and reported to cause severe fever as well as myalgia, joint pain and rash within 2\u20135 days of infection [1], [2]. Recently, CHIKV reemerged in Eastern Africa and has developed into a major epidemic in the Indian Ocean region. In 2006, an outbreak on the island of La R\u00e9union resulted in the infection of approximately one-third of the inhabitants [3], [4]. It has since spread to India and Southeast Asia with estimates of between 1\u20136 million people having been infected [5], [6]. Concerns for the globalization of this virus has evolved given the continuation of this epidemic, the high serum viremia seen in infected patients, and mutations in the currently circulating strain of CHIKV that have allowed it to adapt to a more widely distributed mosquito vector [7]. These concerns have been raised by both an increase in the number of foreign travelers contracting CHIKV and returning to both Europe and the United States, and by the possibility of spread by infected individuals, the latter being exemplified by an outbreak in Italy in 2007 and in Southern France in 2010 [5], [8], [9].",

Infected neonates, however, display more severe disease, with symptoms including encephalopathy and cerebral hemorrhage, with a subset of these infants developing permanent disabilities [10]. During the recent epidemic, it was reported for the first time that CHIKV-infected mothers can transmit the virus to their newborns during delivery, with a vertical transmission rate of approximately 50%, and in some instances infection resulted in mortality [10]. This age dependence of disease severity has also been reported for other alphaviruses and can be reproduced in mouse models through the infection of suckling mice. Indeed, it has been shown that neonatal mice succumb to Ross River Virus (RRV) [11], Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) [12], Sindbis Virus (SINV) as well as CHIKV [13]\u2013[15]. There are likely several factors that contribute to this increased sensitivity in neonates, including alterations in the neonatal immune response.",

            "text": "Regarding immune function in neonates, developmental delays have been described for the adaptive immune responses, however less is known about neonatal innate responses. While still controversial, many reports indicate that neonatal responses are diminished as compared to adults. For example, cord blood cells stimulated with toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands produced low levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-12 [16]. Neonatal plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) have also been shown to have impaired production of type I IFN in response to CpG stimulation [17]. It has been shown that LPS does not effectively activate IRF-3 dependent responses, including the production of IFN\u03b2 [18]. The response to cytokines may also be impaired as there is evidence that STAT-1 recruitment following IFN\u03b3 stimulation is less efficient in neonatal than in adult leukocytes [19]. Based on the critical role of type I IFN in the control of CHIKV infection [20], we considered the possibility that neonates may have a developmental delay in their type I IFN response, possibly contributing to their increased susceptibility to CHIKV infection and viral dissemination.",

            "text": "In response to CHIKV infection, the production of type I IFNs is triggered by the engagement of the Rig-I like receptor (RLR) pathway [20], [21]. IFNs then stimulate the induction of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and it is through these ISGs that IFNs mediate their effector function [22]. One of the earliest ISGs induced following IFN stimulation is ISG15. ISG15 is a 17 kDa protein that contains two ubiquitin-like domains connected by a proline peptide linker [23]. Similar to ubiquitin, ISG15 can form conjugates with an array of intracellular host and viral proteins through the use of an E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UbcH8), and E3 (e.g., Herc5, EFP, HHARI) enzymatic cascade [24]\u2013[28]. Conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins has been suggested to cause either a gain or loss of function of the targeted protein, although the consequences of ISG15 conjugate formation are not well understood [29]\u2013[32]. An unconjugated form of ISG15 can also be found in the sera of humans treated with IFN-\u03b2ser as well as in virally infected mice [33], [34]. The released form of ISG15 has been suggested to have cytokine like activity [35]\u2013[37], however its role during an antiviral immune response has not been examined.",

ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with influenza B virus display a 2\u20133 log increase in lung viral titers as well as elevated cytokine and chemokine levels [34]. The ability of ISG15 to conjugate to target proteins appears to be essential for ISG15's antiviral activity during certain viral infections, as UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack the ability to form ISG15 conjugates, phenocopy ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice during both SINV and influenza B virus infection [39]\u2013[41]. Further support for the importance of ISG15 conjugation during viral infection comes from the evolution of viral proteins that directly target ISG15 conjugate formation. Both the NS1 protein of influenza B virus and the E3L protein of vaccinia virus inhibit ISG15 conjugate formation, while OTU-domain containing viral proteins, such as the L protein of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) or the Nsp2 protein of Equine Arteritis virus (EAV), and the SARS coronavirus papain-like protease (SARS-CoV PLpro) exert both deubiquitinating and deISGylating activity [24], [38], [42], [43]. Therefore, the antiviral activity of ISG15 has been thought to be conjugation dependent.",

While insufficient to completely control infection, IFNs participate in limiting the infection. We also show that ISG15 is induced during CHIKV infection and plays a critical role in protecting neonatal mice from viral induced lethality. Surprisingly, the mechanism of action by which ISG15 limits infection is independent of UbE1L mediated conjugation, as UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed no phenotypic differences as compared to WT animals. Furthermore, ISG15 does not directly inhibit viral replication, as suggested by the similar viral loads in WT and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice. Instead, ISG15 appears to function as an immunomodulatory molecule in this model. These data demonstrate a novel role for ISG15 during viral infection and suggests that prophylactic measures targeting the induction of IFN and ISG15 may help protect neonates during future CHIKV outbreaks.",

In addition, the chemokines/cytokines known to be induced by IFNs were highly expressed. These included CCL2, CCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL-1R\u03b1, IL-12p40/p70; and strikingly these analytes, with the exception of CXCL9, showed higher plasma concentrations in infants as compared to adult patients (\nFigure 1B\n).

Also of interest, while we observed marked induction of so-called Th1 cytokines, such as IFN\u03b3 and IL-12p40/p70, there was no clear skewing toward a Th1 response. In fact, we observed high levels of Th2 cytokines as well as Th17 cytokines (\nFigure 1C\n).

Within the infant group, viral load negatively correlated with age, corroborating the observation that newborns are more susceptible to CHIKV induced disease (\nFigure 2A\n). In adults, there was also an age-dependent trend with elderly harboring higher viral loads (\nFigure 2A\n). Again this is consistent with the report that increased age is a risk factor for severe CHIKV disease [44]. Next, we plotted plasma IFN\u03b1 concentrations as a function of age. These data demonstrate a strong negative correlation in infants, and followed the pattern seen for CHIKV titers (\nFigure 2B\n). We found that IFN\u03b1 levels correlated with viral loads in both group (\nFigure 2C\n). To normalize for CHIKV titers, we separated each cohort in two groups (<global median: low viral load; and > global median: high viral load); in both groups the levels of IFN\u03b1 were more elevated in infected infants than in infected adults (\nFigure 2D\n). Furthermore, we performed univariate linear regression analysis to model the effect of infant status on plasma IFN\u03b1 concentrations. Infants had higher IFN\u03b1 concentrations compared to adults (RGM [95% CI] = 5.49 [3.16\u20139.53]; p<0.001). This effect remained significant after adjustment for viral load (adjusted RGM [95% CI] = 3.44 (2.07\u20135.70]; p<0.001). Thus for a similar viral load, infants produce more IFN\u03b1 than adults. To represent associations between age, viral load, IFN\u03b1 and the immune signature, we established a network plot of significant correlations (\nFigure 2E\n). These data argue against infants being compromised in their response to CHIKV infection; however, we could not determine whether their IFN response was protective. To address this issue and to examine the mechanism of ISG mediated control of CHIKV, we exploited a recently described neonatal mouse model for studying infection [15].",

Infection of 6 day old animals resulted in 100% mortality; 9 day old animals developed paralysis, with approximately 50% of the animals succumbing to infection; while by 12 days of age the mice became refractory to symptoms of severe disease and lethality [15]. To compare our experimental mouse model of CHIKV infection to the response seen in human infants we assessed the IFN and proinflammatory responses in 8\u20139 day old mice. We first assessed the induction of the IFN response at the local site of infection by monitoring mRNA levels of IFN\u03b2 and selected interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the skin. Mice were inoculated with 2\u00d7105 PFU of CHIKV and the injection site was removed between 3\u2013120 hrs post-infection. Increased expression of IFN\u03b2 mRNA could be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection with peak levels being achieved at 16 hrs post-infection (\nFigure 3A\n). Similar to IFN\u03b2 mRNA induction, IRF7, Mx1 and ISG15 mRNA levels could also be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection, with peak levels observed at 16 hrs post-infection (\nFigure 3A\n). Thus, at the site of infection, neonatal mice are able to induce IFN\u03b2 expression as well as a subset of known ISGs. Of note, IRF7 and Mx1 mRNA expression is indicative of signaling via the type I IFN receptor, suggesting that the production as well as reception of IFN\u03b1\u03b2 is intact in neonatal mice.",

Most interestingly, the mice displayed increased levels of the pyrogenic cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, which were not seen in our studies of human infants (\nFigure 3C\n). While this may represent differences in pathogenesis, we believe it is more a reflection of the fact that the mice can be assessed within hours of viral inoculation, while the exact timing of the human infection is unknown. Overall, we find that the similarities between the mouse and human responses support the use of neonatal mice to study the response to CHIKV infection, and indicate that induction of IFNs, as well as the triggering of an ISG response, are both rapid and robust.",

These pups developed a rapid, disseminated infection. Within 1 day of infection, the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed viral loads at the injection site that were 100-fold higher than that detected in WT controls. We also observed a striking increase in viral titers in the serum and multiple organs, including the brain, liver, and lung (\nFigure 4B\n).

One potential explanation is that neonates possess a developmental delay in their IFN-response that makes them susceptible to infection as compared to adult animals. It was therefore important to determine whether prophylactic innate immune responses could protect neonatal animals from CHIKV infection. To evaluate this question, we injected mice with 25 \u00b5g of poly I\u2236C (pIC), a known inducer of type I IFN, and 1 day later mice were challenged with 2\u00d7105 PFU of CHIKV. At 7 hrs post treatment with pIC, robust levels of IFN\u03b1 were detected in the serum of neonatal mice (\nFigure 5A\n). Following CHIKV infection, mice were monitored daily for the development of symptoms and followed for lethality. Remarkably, 96% of the pIC treated mice survived, in contrast to only 40% of control mice (\nFigure 5B\n). Treatment with pIC also prevented CHIKV induced paralysis, with only 7% of the pIC treated mice developing paralysis during the course of the infection, as compared to 84% in the control group (\nFigure 5C\n). Independent experiments were performed using prophylactic treatment with 5000 U IFN\u03b2. At both day 7 and day 11 post-infection, mice receiving recombinant IFN\u03b2 displayed less severe disease, as compared to control PBS injected animals (Figure S1), however, we did not see a statistical difference in survival, possibly due to the short half-life of IFN\u03b2. To confirm that the protection induced by pIC was mediated by IFN, we repeated these experiments in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice. As seen in \nFigure 5D\n, treatment of IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice with pIC resulted in no protection from lethality. These results indicate that the prophylactic engagement of the IFN receptor in neonates is able to induce a protective anti-viral response.",

The analysis of selected ISGs expressed at the site of infection revealed that ISG15 mRNA was rapidly and strongly induced during CHIKV infection (\nFigure 3A\n). ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like molecule that conjugates to both host and viral proteins and has been previously shown to participate in the host response to SINV infection. An evaluation of ISG15 protein expression at the site of infection and within the serum confirmed that ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates were induced during CHIKV infection in WT mice (\nFigure 6B,C\n\n). As we previously described during neonatal SINV infection [45], the expression of ISG15 during CHIKV infection was also dependent upon intact IFN signaling since IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 pups infected with CHIKV did not induce detectable levels of ISG15 (Figure S2). To test the hypothesis that ISG15 is important in the control of CHIKV, we infected ISG15\u2212/\u2212 neonatal mice, comparing them to weight and age-matched WT control animals. Mice were followed daily for signs of illness and survival. As reported above, infection of 9 day old WT neonatal mice resulted in 58% lethality, with deaths occurring between days 10\u201313 post-infection. In contrast, a dramatic increase in lethality was observed in neonatal mice lacking ISG15, with greater than 70% of the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice succumbing to infection within 3 days, and 100% of the mice dying by day 9 post-infection (\nFigure 6A\n).",

We infected either WT or ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice at 11 or 12 days of age, or we infected adult mice between 6\u20138 weeks of age. By 11 days of age the WT mice had become largely resistant to CHIKV induced lethality with only 15% of the mice succumbing to infection (Figure S3A). In contrast, we observed 100% lethality in the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice, although the onset of lethality was delayed, with the majority of the mice dying between 10 and 14 days post-infection. By 12 days of age the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice still showed clinical signs of disease, with a dramatic decrease in weight gain as compared to the WT controls (data not shown), but by this age only 20% of the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice succumbed to the infection (Figure S3B). Strikingly, adult ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice, similar to WT controls, displayed no lethality and showed no signs of disease following CHIKV infection (Figure S3C). Therefore, we conclude that ISG15 contributes to the control of CHIKV during neonatal infection, but redundant mechanisms are responsible for the control of CHIKV during adult infection.",

We had previously shown that the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins is essential for the control of several viral infections [40], [41]. UbE1L is the only identified E1 for ISG15, and mice lacking UbE1L express free ISG15, but fail to form ISG15 conjugates [39]. To establish a role for ISG15 conjugation, 9 day old UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with CHIKV. Surprisingly, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed no increase in lethality following CHIKV infection, and instead had a lethality curve similar to that observed in WT mice (\nFigure 6A\n). Similarly, pIC treated UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice were protected to the level of WT controls (\nFigure 6D, E\n). Western blot analysis on skin/muscle from the site of infection (\nFigure 6B\n), as well as serum (\nFigure 6C\n), was used to confirm that UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice generated no ISG15 conjugates during CHIKV infection, whereas WT mice showed robust conjugate formation. Additional organs (lung and liver) were also examined and no conjugates were detected in UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown). Thus, we demonstrate that the activity of ISG15 during CHIKV infection is UbE1L independent.",

This strategy was based on our previous report in which recombinant SINV expressing WT ISG15 (LRLRGG) rescued the increased lethality observed in the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice, while mutant ISG15 (LRLRAA) failed to compensate for the ISG15 deficiency [34], [40].

We next assessed viral titers on days 1 and 2 post-infection. As expected, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed similar viral loads in multiple tissues when compared to WT mice at days 1 and 2 post-infection (\nFigure 7A and B\n). Given that the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 pups infected at 9 days of age displayed a dramatic increase in lethality, with kinetics similar to that observed in the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, we expected to detect increased viral titers in the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice. To our surprise, at 1 day post-infection the serum and tissues analyzed from the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice contained viral titers that were similar to those obtained in both UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice (\nFigure 7A\n). This was in striking contrast to the 2\u20133 log increase in viral loads detected in the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice 1 day post-infection (\n\nFigure 4B\n\n). By 2 days post-infection, just prior to when the majority of ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice succumb to infection, we still detected similar viral loads between WT, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice in the analyzed tissues (\nFigure 7B\n). Based on these data we suggest that ISG15 may not be playing a direct anti-viral role, but instead may be acting via an unexpected mechanism of regulating host sensitivity to the viral induced immune response.",

IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels were induced in the skin of WT, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice at 24 and 48 hrs post infection with no significant differences noted between the three strains of animals (\nFigure 8A\n). Serum from WT, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 and ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice collected at 1 or 2 days post-infection were analyzed for IFN\u03b1 as well as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Analysis of IFN\u03b1 serum levels also revealed no significant differences between WT, ISG15\u2212/\u2212, and UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice at either 24 or 48 hrs post-infection (\nFigure 8B\n). Despite similar viral loads and type I IFN induction, the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed elevated levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 as compared to both the WT and UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice (\nFigure 8C\n). Interestingly the levels of these three pyrogenic cytokines in the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice were comparable to what was observed in the IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 pups, despite the latter having significantly higher viral loads. ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice also displayed elevated chemokine levels, including CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 (\nFigure 8C\n). Therefore, although viral titers between ISG15\u2212/\u2212, UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice are similar, ISG15\u2212/\u2212 neonates display an exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine response to CHIKV infection. Together, these data indicate that ISG15, independent of UbE1L mediated conjugation, is contributing to the control of CHIKV infection by blunting potentially pathologic levels of innate effector molecules.",

Epidemiological studies have provided the first documentation of vertical transmission, as well as providing detailed information about the severity of disease and long term sequelae [4], [46]\u2013[48]. One important finding from these studies concerns the increased susceptibility of neonates and infants to severe forms of Chikungunya disease [10], [44], [49]. In this study, we evaluated the response of infants to CHIKV infection using data from both human samples collected during the La R\u00e9union outbreak, as well as taking advantage of a newly described mouse model of infection. Our results show that human infants and murine neonates mount a robust innate immune response to CHIKV infection, which includes the induction of type I IFNs, several cytokines and chemokines, and the induction of at least a subset of IFN induced genes, including ISG15. We establish a role for ISG15 in the pathogenesis of CHIKV infection with an absolutely essential role in the neonatal response to infection. Moreover, the reported data suggest that ISG15 acts independent of UbE1L mediated conjugation, and rather than exerting a direct anti-viral role, it appears to be implicated in limiting an exaggerated inflammatory response.",

            "text": "In general, neonates are more susceptible to microbial and viral infection. This vulnerability has been explained by two principal mechanisms: broader tropism of the infectious agent or a defective host response. Regarding the latter, many argue that neonatal susceptibility to infection is due to a delayed or weaker immune response [16], [50]. Factors contributing to this include delays in immune system maturation, decreased expression of activation receptors, or distinct regulation of signaling pathways in neonatal vs. adult immune cells. Since the type I IFN response is critical for controlling CHIKV infection [15], [20], we hypothesized that neonates may have a defect in their ability to either produce and/or respond to IFN. Instead, we observed that the production of type I IFN was intact in both human infants and mouse neonates. Furthermore, the relative level of IFN produced in infants was higher than the responses observed in adult human patients, even when viral load was normalized between the two patient groups (\nFigures 1\n\n\u2013\n\n2\n). These data indicate that neonates do not have a defect in their ability to produce type I IFN during CHIKV infection, and may actually be hyper-responsive. Very little has been reported on the signaling through RLRs or other viral sensors in neonates. Most previous work has supported the notion that signaling through TLRs, including TLR4, are diminished in neonates [51], [52]. However, one study did find that neonatal mice exhibited increased lethality following LPS treatment, due in part to an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response as compared to adult mice [53]. Future work is needed to characterize differences that may exist between neonatal and adult RLR signaling.",

These observations were confirmed by demonstrating the greater susceptibility of neonatal mice lacking expression of the type I IFN receptor (\nFigure 4\n); notably, the kinetics of viral replication and death were massively accelerated as compared to age-matched WT controls.

            "text": "Most importantly, the results from our current study indicate that ISG15 is regulating CHIKV pathogenesis by a unique mechanism of action. First, we demonstrate that ISG15 regulates CHIKV infection independent of UbE1L mediated conjugation. The protection mediated by ISG15 during pIC prophylaxis also appeared to be UbE1L independent, as UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed survival curves similar to WT mice (\nFigure 6D, 6E\n). These results suggest that the non-classical function of ISG15 is at work both during acute viral infection and in the pIC induced protection seen in our mice. This is in contrast to both influenza virus and SINV infection, where the anti-viral activity of ISG15 is dependent upon ISG15 conjugation and abrogated in UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 animals [40], [41]. To date, UbE1L is the only known E1 for the ISG15 pathway. A second E1 has recently been identified for the ubiquitin pathway [55], leaving open the possibility that another E1 may exist for ISG15. However, our current analysis (\nFigure 6\n) and previous studies [39] have revealed no conjugation activity in UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 cells and mice. Therefore the actions of ISG15 during CHIKV infection are likely to be independent of conjugation, and mediated by free ISG15. Second, it appears that during CHIKV infection, ISG15 is not functioning as a direct antiviral molecule. In both the influenza and SINV models, the increase in lethality was accompanied by a dramatic increase in viral loads [34], [38], [41]. In contrast, during CHIKV infection, ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice did not show an increased CHIKV burden (\nFigure 7\n). Instead, we noted a significant elevation of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the ISG15 deficient mice (\nFigure 8\n). Therefore, as opposed to having direct antiviral activity, it appears that ISG15 modulates the immune response during CHIKV infection. Finally, in contrast to what was previously reported for control of SINV infection [34], a recombinant CHIKV expressing ISG15 was unable to rescue neonatal ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice from viral induced lethality (Figure S4). The inability to rescue the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 phenotype may be due to insufficient levels or inappropriate timing of ISG15 expression; or alternatively, may indicate that ISG15 expression is required in an uninfected cell. Since we detect no differences in viral load, and instead observed increased cytokine levels in the ISG15\u2212/\u2212 mice, we favor this latter possibility. Further analysis into the precise mechanism by which ISG15 regulates the host response to CHIKV should provide additional insight into this issue. Together, our data suggest a novel mechanism for ISG15, which is likely to be independent of conjugation and extrinsic to virally infected cells.",

            "text": "The precise mechanism by which ISG15, independent of UbE1L mediated conjugation, contributes to the control of viral infection is currently unclear. The most intriguing difference we have noted to date is the increased cytokine responses in the mice lacking ISG15 (\nFigure 8\n). As noted above, while we cannot formally exclude the possibility of another E1 functioning in this system, it seems most likely that free, unconjugated ISG15 mediates the activity during CHIKV infection. Free ISG15 is found within the cell, but interestingly it may also be secreted by a still undefined mechanism [33]. Previous work has shown that unanchored ISG15 can associate non-covalently with proteins (i.e. independent of conjugation). For example, the NS1 protein of influenza B virus can non-covalently bind ISG15, thereby inhibiting its interaction with UbE1L and blocking conjugation of target proteins [24]. The over-expression of ISG15 has also been shown to disrupt Nedd4 ligase activity and inhibit Ebola virus VLP release [56], [57]. Recent research within the ubiquitin field has described a role for unanchored polyubiquitin chains, shown to regulate TRAF6 function, as well as promote RIG-I dimerization and signaling [58], [59]. It is therefore possible that intracellular, unanchored ISG15 interacts non-covalently with members of an innate immune signaling pathway to regulate cytokine and chemokine production or other host response pathways. Alternatively, released ISG15 could be contributing to the phenotype seen during CHIKV infection. Indeed, the 17 kDa form of ISG15 is released into the serum in both WT and UbE1L\u2212/\u2212 mice during CHIKV infection (\nFigure 6\n). Released ISG15 has been reported to function as an immunomodulatory molecule, increasing NK cell proliferation and lytic activity, acting as a neutrophil chemoattractant, and upregulating E-cadherin expression on dendritic cells [35]\u2013[37]. Released ISG15 could function as in immunomodulatory cytokine by signaling through a receptor to regulate the cytokine response or through its ability to function as a chemoattractant. In order to characterize these effects in greater detail, a receptor for ISG15 must be identified. Future studies evaluating these possibilities will be required in order to further define the mechanism by which ISG15 is contributing to the host response to CHIKV.",

Paralysis was scored as an inability or long delay (>5s) to return and land on its feet when flipped on its back. For experiments with adult mice, 6\u20138 week old mice were infected as outlined above and followed for daily weight loss and lethality. For experiments utilizing the recombinant CHIKV clones, 6 day old pups were infected with 3\u00d7105 PFU of the indicated recombinant virus diluted in 30 \u00b5L of PBS by s.c. injection into the right flank. Viral titers were determined in organs harvested at the indicated days post-infection. Organs were harvested into 1 ml of DMEM without fetal bovine serum and homogenized with 1.0 mm diameter zirconia-silica beans at 3,200 rpm for 1 minute with a MagnaLyzer prior to plaque assay on BHK cells, protocol modified from [63]. Serial dilutions of organ homogenates in DMEM with 1% FBS was added to BHK cells (6\u00d7105 cells for 6 well plates) and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. An agar overlay was then added to the cells and incubated for 28 hrs at 37\u00b0C. Plates were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (>30 min at room temperature), agar plugs were removed and plaques were visualized using a 1% crystal violet solution.",
