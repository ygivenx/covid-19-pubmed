            "text": "Parainfluenza virus type 5 [PIV5; previously known as simian virus 5 (SV5)] is a member of the genus Rubulavirus in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae of the family Paramyxoviridae (Lamb & Parks, 2006). Like other paramyxoviruses, PIV5 is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented negative-sense RNA genome of 15 246 bases with seven tandemly linked genes that encode eight proteins. The RNA genome encodes, from the 3\u2032 end, the nucleo- (NP), phospho- (P), V, matrix (M), fusion (F), small hydrophobic (SH), haemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase (HN) and large (L) proteins. All viral RNA synthesis is initiated at or close to the 3\u2032 end of the genomic or antigenomic RNA. During transcription, the viral polymerase recognizes gene-start and gene-stop sequences in the genomic RNA, resulting in the generation of individual mRNAs that are also capped and polyadenylated by the viral polymerase. Failure of the polymerase to reinitiate at downstream gene-start sites, or disengagement of the polymerase from the genome, results in a transcriptional gradient, with the NP gene being transcribed the most frequently and the L gene the least. The second gene, the V/P gene, encodes both the P and the V proteins using an RNA editing mechanism. During replication, the polymerase must ignore the gene-start and gene-stop signals to make full-length copies of either the genomic or antigenomic template. As with other negative-strand RNA viruses, the polymerase does not replicate or transcribe naked RNA but rather uses the ribonucleoprotein complex as its template (for a general review of the molecular biology of paramyxovirsues, see Lamb & Parks, 2006, and for an extensive recent review on PIV5, see Parks et al., 2011).",

            "text": "Like other viruses, to survive in nature, PIV5 has to circumvent, at least partially, the interferon (IFN) response (Randall & Goodbourn, 2008). The IFN response is triggered when virus infection results in the generation of molecules, such as dsRNA, that display molecular signatures, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), that are not found in uninfected cells and that are recognized by cellular receptors, termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Kumar et al., 2011). The two most important cytoplasmic PRRs for detecting PAMPs produced by RNA viruses are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). RIG-I preferentially recognizes uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA molecules that have a short stretch of dsRNA, whilst MDA-5 recognizes longer molecules of dsRNA that do not need to be 5\u2032 triphosphorylated (Schmidt et al., 2011). Upon binding their appropriate ligands, both RIG-I and MDA-5 initiate a signalling cascade that results in the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 from the infected cells. The secreted IFN then acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to upregulate the expression of hundreds of cellular genes, many of which have direct or indirect antiviral activity (Randall & Goodbourn, 2008).",

            "text": "PIV5 has a number of strategies to minimize the effectiveness of the IFN response. It encodes an IFN antagonist, the V protein, which limits the production of IFN and blocks IFN signalling (reviewed by Goodbourn & Randall, 2009; Ramachandran & Horvath, 2009). The V protein limits IFN induction by interacting directly with MDA-5, preventing it from binding dsRNA and thus preventing activation of the IFN induction cascade (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Childs et al., 2009). Furthermore, whilst the V protein does not bind directly to RIG-I, it indirectly inhibits RIG-I by binding to Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2 protein (LGP2, a helicase related to RIG-I and MDA-5), stabilizing the interaction of LGP2 with RIG-I, thereby inhibiting RIG-I (Childs et al., 2012). In addition, it can act as a competitive inhibitor of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), reducing its ability to phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) (Lu et al., 2008). The V protein also blocks IFN signalling by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) for proteasome-mediated degradation (Didcock et al., 1999) by a mechanism that requires it to act as a bridge between a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase and STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers (Parisien et al., 2002; Precious et al., 2005). In addition, to these mechanisms, PIV5 tightly controls the transcription and replication of its genome, thereby limiting the production of PAMPs that may activate the IFN induction cascade (Goodbourn & Randall, 2009; Parks et al., 2011). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that PIV5 does this so successfully that PAMPs that activate the IFN induction cascade are not produced during normal virus replication (Killip et al., 2011, 2012). Instead, PAMPs that activate the IFN response are produced primarily by defective interfering particles that are generated during aberrant virus replication (Chen et al., 2010; Killip et al., 2011).",

During plaque development, a few, rather than all, infected cells produce the IFN that induces an antiviral state in the surrounding uninfected cells (Chen et al., 2010). Whilst the replication of PIV5 is severely restricted in cells in an IFN-induced antiviral state (Carlos et al., 2005), nevertheless the virus manages to target STAT1 for proteasome-mediated degradation (Didcock et al., 1999; Precious et al., 2007). As a consequence, in the absence of continuous stimulation by IFN, the cell cannot maintain its antiviral state indefinitely, and within 24\u201348 h, the virus manages to establish a normal pattern of virus replication (Carlos et al., 2009).",

It is thus possible to infect such \u2018IFN-compromised\u2019 cells with CPI\u2212 to allow the virus to establish a normal replication pattern and then at various time post-infection (p.i.) to add IFN to the culture medium and monitor the effects of IFN on virus replication and protein synthesis (Carlos et al., 2005). Using this system, we have shown previously that the addition of IFN to cells actively synthesizing CPI\u2212 proteins alters the pattern of virus mRNA transcription and induces a marked reduction in virus protein synthesis, particularly of the M and HN proteins (Carlos et al., 2005). Using this system, we showed that myxovirus A (MxA), protein kinase R (PKR) and oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L are not responsible for the alteration in virus protein synthesis observed following IFN treatment (Carlos et al., 2007). Here, we present evidence that IFN-stimulated gene 56/IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (ISG56/IFIT1) is primarily responsible for the observed effects of IFN on PIV5 transcription and protein synthesis.",

At 18 h p.i., the cells were fixed and stained for viral NP and for the overexpressed ISGs. Overexpression of IFIT3, IFI35, ISG15, ISG20 and viperin did not have any obvious effect on the levels of NP or P (data not shown).

When control cells (i.e. those that express BVDV-Npro but not shISG56/IFIT1) were infected with the CPI\u2212 strain of PIV5, a normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was observed (Fig. 2, lanes 1). However, virus protein synthesis was dramatically reduced in cells pre-treated with IFN (Fig. 2, lanes 2). In striking contrast, a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was observed in IFN-treated cells with impaired ISG56/IFIT1 expression (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4).",

When the ISG56/IFIT1-knockdown cells were infected with CPI\u2212 and subsequently treated with IFN, a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was again observed (compare lanes 7 and 8 in Fig. 2). Knockdown of ISG56/IFIT1 in na\u00efve Hep2 cells (i.e. without the expression of BVDV-Npro), which can produce and respond to IFN and thus begin to inhibit PIV5 prior to the addition of exogenous IFN to the culture medium, also restored a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis, even when exogenous IFN was added to the culture medium (Fig. S2). Similar results were also obtained with na\u00efve A549 cells (Fig. S3). These results clearly demonstrated that ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the IFN-induced inhibition of virus protein synthesis. It was also striking that the effect of IFN on the levels of virus protein synthesis in Hep2/BVDV-Npro cells was not due to a general shutdown of protein synthesis, as the levels of host protein synthesis were similar in IFN pre-treated, post-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2; see also Fig. 5).",

We first undertook a time-course study of virus mRNA accumulation in the absence of an IFN response in control cells. For this analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to measure the relative amounts of NP, P/V, M, HN and L viral mRNAs in CPI\u2212-infected control cells. The results from this analysis (Fig. 3) showed that the highest mRNA levels occurred at around 18 h p.i. and that the general pattern was the same at all time points examined. A clear gradation of mRNA levels for the NP, P, HN and L genes was observed, with L mRNA being the least abundant. As expected, the gradient was related to the order of these genes within the virus genome, consistent with a predictable dissociation of the virus RNA polymerase from the template. The exception to this was M mRNA, which was always significantly less abundant than HN mRNA, despite the more proximal position of the M gene to the 3\u2032 promoter (discussed below). When control cells were treated with IFN at 8 h prior to infection with CPI\u2212 and the levels of viral mRNA measured at 20 h p.i., a significant decrease was observed in the amount of all viral mRNAs (Fig. 4). However, surprisingly, treating cells with IFN at 8 h after infection increased, rather than decreased, the amount of all the viral mRNAs, with the greatest increase noted in the amount of L mRNA, suggesting that there was less chance of the polymerase disengaging from the template in cells treated with IFN after infection. Under these conditions, the level of M mRNA was higher than that of HN mRNA (Fig. 4). In contrast to the control cells, treating CPI\u2212-infected Hep2/BVDV-Npro/shISG56/IFIT1 cells with IFN either prior to or after infection did not significantly alter either the pattern or levels of virus transcript accumulation.",

As, under these conditions, there was no such marked reduction in the synthesis of cellular proteins, these data suggested that IFN, through the action of ISG56/IFIT1, induced a specific block in the translation of viral mRNAs. To investigate this further, mRNA was isolated from CPI\u2212-infected control cells at 20 h p.i. and translated in cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In order to compare the pattern of virus protein synthesis with that in cells, parallel cultures were also labelled with [35S]methionine. In complete contrast to the decrease in virus protein synthesis observed in infected cells, there was an obvious increase in the amount of all the viral proteins made by in vitro translation of mRNA isolated from cells that had been treated with IFN (Fig. 5; note the M protein in total cell samples has been highlighted with asterisks). This was consistent with our qPCR data (Fig. 4), which showed that IFN treatment of cells after infection led to an increase in viral mRNA synthesis, and demonstrated that the mRNA remained translatable. In contrast, there was no increase in the in vitro translation of cellular proteins, confirming the selective block on viral mRNA translation in CPI\u2212-infected control cells following IFN treatment. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that ISG56/IFIT1 selectively inhibits the translation of viral mRNA.",

Although the PIV5 polymerase is predicted to have 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity (Ferron et al., 2002), we tested whether the CPI\u2212 mRNA cap was methylated at 2\u2032-O positions. mRNA was isolated from mock- or CPI\u2212-infected control cells at 20 h p.i. and the incorporation of 3H-labelled methyl groups from donor S-adenosyl-methionine was monitored by in vitro methylation assays using the vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase VP39 (Schnierle et al., 1992).

Pre-treatment of control cells with IFN reduced the titres by ~5 logs (from ~108 to ~103 p.f.u. ml\u22121).

This conclusion was supported by the observation that, whilst knockdown of ISG56/IFIT1 facilitated CPI\u2212 plaque formation on na\u00efve A549 cells (which do not normally support CPI\u2212 plaques), the plaques that were formed were not as large as those observed on control cells (i.e. those that expressed BVDV-Npro; Fig. 8b).",

Thus, during plaque development, a few virus-infected cells produce IFN, which induces an antiviral state in the uninfected cells surrounding the plaque, thereby slowing the spread of virus (Carlos et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010). Here, we set out to understand in more detail how IFN induces an antiviral state to PIV5 by identifying the ISGs that inhibit virus replication. The results presented here demonstrated that, although other ISGs contribute to a minor degree to the IFN-induced antiviral state, remarkably ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the observed IFN-induced alterations in PIV5 transcription and protein synthesis.",

            "text": "ISG56/IFIT1 is a member of a family of proteins whose expression is strongly induced from very low basal levels by IFN, and by activated IRF-3 (reviewed by Fensterl & Sen, 2011). IFIT1 family members have structural features in common: all contain several tetratricopeptide repeats representing helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motifs that mediate a variety of protein\u2013protein interactions. The best-studied cellular function of ISG56/IFIT1 is the inhibition of translation initiation (Guo et al., 2000; Terenzi et al., 2005) that is mediated through its binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). In addition to a general inhibition of mRNA translation, it has been suggested recently that ISG56/IFIT1 specifically inhibits the translation of viral mRNAs that are not appropriately capped. Eukaryotic host mRNAs are modified at the 5\u2032 end by the addition of a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032-linked, non-templated guanosine residue, which is methylated at N7, and additionally have 2\u2032-O-methylation of the ribose ring of the first one or two templated bases. Whilst N7-methylation of the guanosine increases translational efficiency, the reason for 2\u2032-O-methylation of the ribose sugars is unclear (Furuichi & Shatkin, 2000). However, recent work has suggested that lack of methylation of the 2\u2032 ribose might allow cells to distinguish self from non-self RNA (Daffis et al., 2010; Pichlmair et al., 2011; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). To avoid this recognition, it is suggested that viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm have evolved both N7- and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases to methylate their viral mRNA cap structures. West Nile virus, mouse coronavirus and vaccinia virus mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity have enhanced sensitivity to IFN and the antiviral activity of IFIT1 proteins (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). It has also been reported recently that ISG56/IFIT1 binds uncapped triphosphorylated RNA, which is found at the 5\u2032 ends of the genomic and antigenomic RNA of some RNA viruses, as well as at the ends of some viral transcripts (Pichlmair et al., 2011). However, the relationship between this property and the ability to preferentially inhibit translation of mRNA with cap structures lacking 2\u2032-O-methyl groups but still having an N7-methylguanosine (and which therefore cannot be triphosphorylated) is unclear.",

(Carlos et al., 2005). How ISG56/IFIT1 activity affects virus transcription remains to be established. It may be that the ISG56/IFIT1-mediated inhibition of viral protein synthesis leads indirectly to an alteration in the pattern of virus transcription. For example, a change in the ratio of a particular virus protein to other viral proteins [e.g. the V protein, which has a relatively short half life (Fearns et al., 1994) and negatively regulates viral RNA synthesis (Lin et al., 2005)] results in an increase in virus transcription and/or alterations to the processivity of the viral polymerase\u2013transcription complex. Alternatively, it may be that ISG56/IFIT1 directly interacts with the viral polymerase, altering its activity. In this regard, it is of note that ISG56/IFIT1 binds to and inactivates the viral E1 helicase of human papillomavirus, which is essential for viral DNA replication (Terenzi et al., 2008).",

At the time, we speculated that this was either because the polymerase was more likely to disengage from the template as it proceeded down the genome in cells treated with IFN, or that IFN somehow affected the stability of the HN mRNA. Given that we have shown that, in IFN-treated PIV5-infected control Hep2 cells, there is an increase in the levels of all the viral mRNAs, this suggests that the latter explanation may have been correct.

In this respect, it is of interest that the most marked reduction in the viral proteins synthesized in cells either pre- or post-treated with IFN encoded proteins downstream of the P gene, in particular the M protein, whilst the synthesis of NP and P, although inhibited, remain relatively high. The reason for these apparent differences in the effects of IFN on the relative inhibition of the different viral proteins remains unclear but may simply reflect the stability of the proteins, with NP and P being very stable and M and HN relatively unstable. Nevertheless, a consequence of this change in the relative levels of the viral proteins (i.e. the increase in the relative amounts of NP and P compared with the other virus proteins) might favour the formation of cytoplasmic bodies. Indeed, the fact that knockdown of ISG56/IFIT1 prevented the formation of inclusion bodies, and that inducible co-expression of NP and P in cell lines leads to the formation of large cytoplasmic aggregates (in the absence of an IFN response; Precious et al., 1995), suggests that it is the balance of viral proteins that are synthesized that influences the formation of viral cytoplasmic bodies rather than the induction of a specific cellular ISG that drives their formation.",

Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged ISG56/IFIT1. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with the different viruses. At 24 h p.i., monolayers of cells on coverslips were incubated in fixing solution (5 % formaldehyde in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized (0.5 % NP-40, 10 % sucrose in PBS) for 10 min and washed three times in PBS containing 1 % FCS. To detect the proteins of interest, cell monolayers were incubated with 20 \u00b5l of appropriately diluted primary antibody for 1 h. For CPI\u2212 infection, mAbs to NP and P proteins were used, named SV5-NP-a and SV5-P-e, respectively (Randall et al., 1987). To detect overexpressed ISG56/IFIT1, anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used. After subsequent incubation with primary antibody, the cells were washed several times with 1 % FCS in PBS and incubated for 1 h with secondary Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (for viral proteins) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for ISG56/IFIT1 detection (Sera Lab).",
