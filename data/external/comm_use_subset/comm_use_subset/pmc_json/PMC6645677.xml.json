The virus causes respiratory diseases such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may lead to pneumonia and acute renal failure in immunocompromised patients and the elderly [1\u20137]. To date, 2,266 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases including 804 related deaths from 27 countries have been reported to World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Currently, such cases are increasingly being reported. MERS-CoV also has the potential for a widespread outbreak, as observed in 2015 in South Korea [8]. Currently, the lack of prophylactic or therapeutic measures has created an urgent need for effective vaccine the development against MERS-CoV infections [9,10].",

The MERS-CoV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [14,15]. The S protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein on the virus surface, contains two functional subunits and mediates viral infection. The S1 subunit comprises N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) that recognizes and binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) receptor on the host cell surface to initiate infection [16\u201318]. The S2 subunit with two heptad repeats (HR), HR1 and HR2, facilitates fusion between the virus and host cell membrane [19,20]. The S glycoprotein is considered as a suitable vaccine candidate for eliciting neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry or neutralize viral infection [21\u201323].",

These vaccine candidates induced humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses. However, a vaccination strategy focused on RBD alone has several issues that may not be optimal for generating neutralizing antibody responses [27] and can only induce partial protection against the MERS-CoV infection [29,37]. Detailed structural analysis revealed that RBD-specific antibodies stimulate the emergence of viral escape mutation in this region; therefore, the generation of more diverse antibodies directed toward both RBD and outside the domain may be a better strategy for developing effective vaccines [27,38].",

The coding sequence for NTD (residues 18\u2013353) was amplified by PCR using the forward (5\u02b9-GA GCTAGCTACGTCGATGTGGGACC-3\u02b9) and reverse primers (5\u02b9-GACTCGAGTTATCAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGATGGGACTCATAGCTACAGTGCAG-3\u02b9) which contain two stop codons and a six-histidine tag sequence. Finally, the PCR products of RBD and NTD gene were inserted into the pShuttle-CMV vector through NheI/XhoI double digestion, respectively. The pShuttle-CMV plasmid was designed to include the start codon and the signal sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) upstream of the transgene sequence. Replication-defective adenoviruses (serotype 5) were generated by inserting foreign sequences via homologous recombination and subsequent purification of recombinant adenovirus (rAd), as described previously [40]. Briefly, the shuttle vector plasmid was electroporated into electrocompetent BJ5183 cells carrying the pAdEasy-1 adenoviral genomic DNA. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was isolated and linearized with PacI and subsequently transfected into HEK293 cells to generate rAd/Spike, rAd/RBD, and rAd/NTD viruses. Mock adenovirus (rAd/mock) was generated by the same method using the empty pShuttle-CMV vector. The recombinant viruses were amplified on HEK293 cells and purified by double-cesium chloride (CsCl2) gradient ultracentrifugation. The expression and secretion of Spike and RBD proteins by rAd-infected HEK293 cells were verified via Western blot analysis by employing anti-MERS-CoV S1 protein rabbit polyclonal antibody [amino acids (aa) 1\u2013725; 40069-T48; Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China] and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The expression and secretion of NTD protein were validated by infecting HEK293 cells and by conducting Western blot analysis using rAd/Spike-immunized mouse serum (1:1,000 dilution) and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Abcam) as a secondary antibody.",

Western blot performed using MERS-CoV S1-specific antibody revealed two prominent bands at ~200 kDa and ~120 kDa for the culture supernatant and lysate of rAd/Spike-infected cells (Fig 1B). We considered the protein species with a higher molecular weight of 200 kDa to be the glycosylated S1/S2 Spike protein and the species with a lower molecular weight of ~120 kDa to be the S1 subunit of the Spike protein cleaved by host cell protease [19,33,36,42,43]. The RBD domain was detected as a single band with a molecular weight of 35\u201340 kDa in the lysate and culture supernatant of rAd/RBD-infected cells (Fig 1C). The molecular weight of RBD increased slightly in the culture supernatant, which might be due to the different patterns of glycosylation between the culture supernatant and the lysate [44]. The single band of ~50 kDa was observed only in the culture supernatant of rAd/NTD-infected HEK293 cells by in-house rAd/Spike-immunized mouse serum (Fig 1D).",

Previous studies have reported that CD8 T-cell responses to the MERS-CoV Spike protein were dominantly directed toward S291 (KYYSIIPHSI) epitope [46]. Other studies also screened epitopes in the RBD region to measure antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses, but the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells responding to other peptides seems to be either undetectable or very low [46,47].

Significant percentages of Kd/S291 tetramer-positive CD8 T cells were detected in the lungs of rAd/NTD- or rAd/Spike-immune mice but not in the lungs of the mice in the rAd/mock or rAd/RBD group (Fig 2C and 2D). S291-specific CD8 T cells were not observed in rAd/RBD-immunized mice, because RBD (aa residues from 367 to 606) does not contain the S291 epitope. To assess the levels of effector CD8 and CD4 T cells secreting IFN-\u03b3, lung lymphocytes were stimulated with S291 peptide or MERS S1 protein, respectively. IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 T cells were also increased significantly in the rAd/Spike and rAd/NTD groups, and IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 T cells were increased significantly in the rAd/Spike group (S1 Fig).",

However, rAd/RBD group exhibited no significant difference in neutralizing activity compared with the rAd/mock control group. To further confirm the neutralizing activity of the rAd/Spike-induced antibody in an authentic MERS-CoV infection of human primary respiratory cells, MERS-CoV were preincubated with the immune sera from rAd/Spike and rAd/mock group before infection of NHNE cells. Subsequently the viral replication levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig 3D, pre-treatment of rAd/Spike-immune sera significantly inhibited MERS-CoV replication while rAd/Mock sera did not.

As shown in Fig 4D, neutralization activity of immune sera was significantly reduced by pre-incubation with NTD, RBD, and S1 protein competitors. Especially, competition with the S1 protein inhibited neutralizing activity by ~60%, while NTD and RBD competitors inhibited neutralization activity by ~8% and ~6%, respectively. In contrast, soluble S2 protein competitor did not have any effect on neutralization activity. These results demonstrate that rAd/Spike can induce neutralizing antibody responses targeting various regions of S1 including NTD and RBD.

MERS-CoV Spike protein is the main mediator of virus entry into the target cells [17,23]. Therefore, Spike protein is one of key targets for the development of vaccines and therapeutics [23]. Several vaccine candidates targeting RBD of the Spike protein have been investigated [22,25,28,29,32,56]. However, it seems that the efficacy of the RBD-based vaccine candidates are limited by the confined breadth of antibody responses and subsequent emergence of escape mutants [27,38,57]. Indeed, it has been shown that several mutations in the RBD region can result in the generation of neutralization escape variants [38,58\u201360]. Several studies have reported that other regions of Spike protein rather than RBD can also be targets of neutralizing antibodies [26,27,48,61].",

Our results clearly showed that the rAd/Spike vaccine expressing full-length Spike protein is the best candidate in terms of immunogenicity and neutralizing efficacy. It is likely that neutralizing epitopes of the Spike protein were located on non-RBD of the S1 subunit as well as RBD, based on the results of protein competitor experiments (Fig 4). The use of full-length Spike as an immunogen in rAd/Spike vaccine might increase the breadth of the antibody responses which will help to reduce the risk of escape mutations [27,57,62]. However, it is not yet clear whether S2 region also contributes for inducing neutralizing antibodies by rAd/Spike vaccination. S2 subunit protein as a competitor did not reduce the neutralizing activities of the immune sera in the protein competitor experiments (Fig 4), and this might be due to the inappropriate conformation of S2 subunit [27,63]. Further studies are needed to determine whether the S2 subunit also contributes for eliciting neutralizing antibodies.",

Accordingly, vaccination routes capable of inducing local mucosal immunity such as secretory IgA would be more potent in preventing MERS-CoV infection. In addition, IN immunization with rAd/Spike vaccine induced significantly higher numbers of specific TRM cells in the airway and lung parenchyma compared with IM-immunized mice (Fig 6). It is likely that lung-resident TRM cells mediate effective protective immunity against respiratory infections [53,65].
