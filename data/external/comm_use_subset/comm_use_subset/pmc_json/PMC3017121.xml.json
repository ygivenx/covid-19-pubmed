            "text": "The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are a family of viral restriction factors that play critical roles in the interferon-mediated control of influenza A virus (IAV) [1]. These proteins inhibit both IAV replication and infection by hemagglutinin (HA)-pseudotyped retroviruses, indicating that they target the IAV entry process. IFITM proteins also restrict an early step in the lifecycle of several flaviviruses, including dengue and West Nile viruses. In contrast, they do not inhibit replication of murine leukemia virus (MLV), or the entry processes of amphotropic MLV, Machupo virus (MACV), Lassa virus (LASV), or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Although IFITM proteins are induced by type I and II interferons, most cells and cell lines express a basal level of one or more of these proteins [2]. IFITM1, 2, and 3 are expressed in a wide range of tissues, whereas IFITM5 expression appears to be limited to bone [3]. Mice have orthologs for IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5, as well as two additional IFITM genes, Ifitm6 and Ifitm7. IFITM4P is a pseudogene in both species [4]. Two IFITM proteins have been identified in chickens, orthologs of human IFITM1 and IFITM5. The IFITM proteins are small (\u223c130 amino acids), with two transmembrane domains separated by a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain. Both amino- and carboxy- domains are luminal [5].",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses usually express surface proteins that mediate attachment of virions to a cellular receptor. Following receptor engagement, these entry proteins undergo conformational changes that ultimately promote mixing of viral and cellular membrane lipids, formation of a fusion pore, and transfer of the viral genome to the cell cytoplasm [6]. The conformational changes of some entry proteins, for example IAV HA or flavivirus E proteins, are induced by low pH [7], [8]. Fusion mediated by these proteins requires access to an acidic cellular compartment such as a late endosome or lysosome. In contrast, other entry proteins such as the envelope proteins of HIV-1 and MLV do not require access to an acidic compartment, and these viruses are presumed to fuse at the plasma membrane or in an early endocytic vesicle [9]. Finally, some entry proteins, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein or the filovirus glycoproteins (GP1,2), indirectly require low pH to activate target-cell proteases necessary for viral entry [10], [11], [12], [13]. Proteolytic cleavage of these entry proteins by lysosomal cathepsin L (SARS-CoV) or cathepsins B and L (Ebola virus; EBOV) promotes the final steps of viral fusion [14], [15]. In the case of SARS-CoV, the requirement for cathepsin L can be circumvented by treatment of receptor-bound virions with trypsin or related proteases [16]. This observation has been used to suggest alternative pathways for SARS-CoV infection, depending on whether cathepsin L or an extracellular protease activates the receptor-associated S protein.",

We observed that various human, mouse, and chicken IFITM orthologs differentially restricted IAV and filoviruses. We further showed that restriction of SARS-CoV was circumvented by trypsin treatment of cell-associated virions. Our data identify variation in the properties of individual IFITM proteins and localize their restriction activity to a late stage in the endocytic pathway. They further suggest that these proteins restrict a broad range of enveloped viruses, and can modulate cellular tropism independently of viral receptor expression.",

            "text": "The IFITM proteins restrict IAV HA-mediated entry, and an early stage in the replication of several flaviviruses [1]. The entry process of each of these viruses is pH dependent. We sought to determine if additional viruses that require access to late endocytic or lysosomal compartments were similarly restricted by these proteins. The entry processes of MARV and EBOV require activation by one or more cathepsins, whose activity is localized to lysosomes [10], [12], [13], [17]. Both EBOV and MARV require cathepsin L activity to infect cells, whereas EBOV also requires cathepsin B activity [10], [12], [13]. Accordingly, we incubated MLV-based pseudoviruses bearing the entry proteins of MARV, EBOV, H5 or H7 IAV, MLV, or MACV with A549 lung epithelial cells transduced to express human IFITM1, 2 or 3, or with vector alone [18], [19], [20]. As we have previously reported [1], infection mediated by the entry proteins of MLV or MACV was unaffected by the presence of IFITM proteins (Fig. 1A), despite their efficient expression (Fig. 1B). In contrast, as reported, IAV HA-mediated entry was markedly inhibited by the same proteins. Similarly, we observed that entry mediated by MARV and EBOV GP1,2 proteins was inhibited by IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Figs. 1A and S1A). Comparable results were obtained in Vero E6 cells, an African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line and the standard cell line for laboratory propagation of these viruses (Figs. 1C and D), and for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), a primary cell target of filovirus infection (Figs. 1E and F). We have repeatedly observed that IFITM-mediated restriction is less efficient in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Consistent with this observation, both IAV HA- and filovirus GP1,2-mediated entry were only partially suppressed in these cells, whereas control pseudoviruses remained unaffected (Figs. 1G and H). Our data indicate that IFITM1, 2, and 3 each restrict MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated entry, and identify cell-type differences in the efficiency of restriction. We speculate that these differences arise from expression differences of necessary restriction cofactors or proteins that interfere with IFITM protein activity.",

As has been previously reported, IFN-\u03b2 treatment upregulated IFITM proteins (Fig. 1J).

Similar results were obtained in A549 cells (Figs. 2D\u2013F). Thus expression of IFITM1, 2, or 3 suppresses replication of infectious MARV and EBOV.

To do so, we first introduced the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), into A549 cells before transducing them to express IFITM1, 2, or 3, or with vector alone [21]. Entry mediated by the SARS-CoV S protein, like IAV HA-mediated entry, was restricted by each IFITM protein, whereas MLV and MACV pseudoviruses were unaffected (Fig. 3A). IFITM expression did not substantially interfere with cell-surface expression of ACE2, indicating that suppression is not due to receptor down-regulation (Fig. 3B and C). Similar results were obtained in Vero E6 cells (Figs. 3D, E, and F). Consistent with SARS-CoV pseudoviruses, infectious SARS-CoV replicated in control Vero cells markedly more efficiently than in cells expressing IFITM1, 2, or 3 (Figs. 3G and H).

To further explore differences HeLa cells were transduced to express shRNA targeting IFITM1, 2, 3 or shRNA targeting both IFITM1 and 3 expression. Cells were maintained in the presence or absence of IFN-\u03b2 and incubated with MARV, EBOV, IAV, MLV or MACV pseudoviruses (Figs. 4A and B). As expected, IFN-\u03b2 efficiently inhibited entry mediated by MARV and EBOV GP1,2 and IAV HA proteins. Depletion of IFITM3 fully restored IAV HA-mediated infection, an effect only modestly enhanced through suppression of IFITM1 expression. In contrast, entry mediated by MARV and EBOV GP1,2 was not restored in cells expressing shRNA targeting IFITM1 or IFITM3 expression. However, when both IFITM1 and IFITM3 were depleted, filovirus GP1,2-mediated entry was partially restored. These results suggest that IAV entry is more sensitive to IFITM3-mediated restriction whereas IFITM1 plays a more important role in suppressing filovirus entry processes.",

Similarly IFITM-targeting shRNA did not affect entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus into ACE2-expressing HeLa cells, whereas IAV infection was again markedly enhanced by IFITM3 shRNA (Fig. 4D). ACE2 expression was comparable in control and IFITM3-depleted cells (Fig. S2B). To explore the role of endogenous IFITM1, we used human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells, which express relatively high levels of this IFITM protein (Fig. 4E). Depletion of IFITM1 markedly enhanced entry of MARV and, to a lesser extent, IAV pseudoviruses (Fig. 4F). Similarly, shRNA targeting IFITM1 did not alter ACE2 expression, but enhanced SARS-CoV S protein-mediated entry (Figs. 4G and S2C). Thus, cells can express different basal levels of each IFITM protein, and these levels differentially alter their susceptibility to IAV and cathepsin-dependent viruses.",

Note that human IFITM5 expression, undetectable by western blotting, was observed by immunofluorescent staining (Fig. S3D). In contrast, mouse and chicken IFITM5 and mouse IFITM6 did not efficiently restrict IAV HA-mediated entry. (An alignment of IFITM orthologs is shown in Fig. S3). Unlike the modest differences between human IFITM1 and IFITM3, these differences were sufficient to be observed in over-expression assays. We conclude that IFITM genes have overlapping but distinct effects on the entry of IAV and filoviruses.",

In contrast to cathepsin L-mediated fusion, exogenous trypsin promotes fusion at or near the plasma membrane. To localize IFITM-mediated restriction, we investigated the effect of trypsin treatment on SARS-CoV entry into IFITM-expressing cells. Vero E6 cells transduced to express ACE2 and IFITM1, 2 or 3, or with vector alone were incubated with SARS-CoV or MACV pseudoviruses. As expected, IFITM expression restricted SARS-CoV S protein-mediated entry, but not MACV GPC-mediated entry. In contrast, when SARS-CoV pseudovirions were bound to ACE2-expressing cells at 4\u00b0C and then incubated with trypsin at 37\u00b0C for a short time, entry into IFTIM-expressing cells was largely restored (Figs. 6A, B, and C). These data suggest that IFITM proteins restrict cathepsin-dependent entry of SARS-CoV in the lysosome, but cannot restrict trypsin-induced fusion at or near the plasma membrane. We did not observe in IFITM-expressing cells any decrease in cellular cathepsin activity that could readily account for this difference (Figs. 6D and E). These data show that IFITM-mediated restriction is not a consequence of a decrease in the activity of lysosomal cathepsins, and suggest that lysosomal pH, which activates cathepsins B and L, is similarly unaffected by IFITM protein expression.",

First, the number and diversity of restricted viruses tends to exclude mechanisms that might be unique to individual viruses. We previously showed that IFITM proteins do not decrease cell-surface expression of sialic acid, the primary attachment moiety for IAV [1]. Similarly, IFITM proteins do not significantly alter expression of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2. Nor is it plausible that there is a physical interaction between the entry proteins of restricted viruses and the IFITM molecules, given the variation among these entry proteins and the ease with which such a mechanism might be evaded. However, all IFITM-restricted viruses described to date require access to late endosomal or lysosomal compartments. This observation raises the possibility that IFITM proteins interfere with endosomal trafficking or, alternatively, make these compartments unsuitable for fusion of restricted viruses.",

Specifically, we circumvented restriction by complementing the cathepsin L requirement of SARS-CoV with exogenous trypsin, thereby promoting fusion at or near the plasma membrane. Moreover, we do not observe any IFITM-induced differences in the efficiency with which virions can access acidic compartments in the cell. Therefore, when viruses are restricted, they are restricted in a late endosomal or lysosomal compartment. We did not, however, observe a loss of cathepsin activity in IFITM-expressing cells, suggesting that this activity and the acidification that it requires are not grossly impaired by IFITM proteins. It is of course possible that these observations reflect underlying limitations in our ability to detect relevant differences. In particular, our ability to detect IAV in acidic compartments of IFITM expressing cells does not exclude the possibility that these compartments are distinct from those where productive infection can occur. Nonetheless, our data suggest that IFITM proteins inhibit viral entry by mediating a change in the properties of late endosomes or lysosomes. Two additional observations are consistent with this hypothesis. First, in some cell lines, enlarged vesicles could be observed in IFITM-expressing cells, although the scale of this enlargement did not correlate with the efficiency of viral restriction. Second, IFITM3 in particular colocalizes extensively with markers of late endosomes and lysosomes, but poorly with a marker of early endosomes (Fig. S5). Our ability to bypass IFITM restriction may also shed light on the course of SARS-CoV infection in vivo. In particular, following induction of an interferon response, replication of the virus is likely to be localized to tissues \u2013 for example the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts \u2013 where trypsin-like proteases are abundant [16].",

In contrast, when endogenous IFITM1 was depleted in K562 cells, more efficient entry was observed for all IFITM-restricted viruses. Also, murine Ifitm5 and Ifitm6, and chicken Ifitm5 efficiently restricted entry mediated by both filovirus GP1,2 proteins, but had little or no effect on IAV HA-mediated entry.

Bottom panels show a control in which Vero E6 cells transduced with vector alone were pretreated with 1 U/ml bacterial neuraminidase (NA) for 24 hours before influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus infection. Leftmost figures show differential interference contrast (DIC) and rightmost figures show the merged images of labeled virions and LysoTracker labeled cells.",
