            "text": "Acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in piglets worldwide. Enteric infections in animals are frequently associated with viruses, including rotaviruses and coronaviruses (CoVs) [1]. A metagenomics analysis of diarrheic and healthy samples from China in 2012 found porcine CoVs in 77% of the diarrheic samples, and only in around 7% of the healthy samples, highlighting the potential relevance of CoVs as enteric porcine pathogens [2]. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was found in more than 50% of the diarrheic samples [2], in agreement with the importance that this virus has for the porcine industry worldwide. PEDV was first described in Europe in the 1970s and the virus has, since then, remained endemic in the European porcine herds [3]. In Asian countries, PEDV was detected in the 1980s, with highly virulent outbreaks observed since 2010 [4]. In 2013, virulent strains related to those circulating in China were detected in the United States (US). Due to the absence of pre-existing immunity, PEDV spread very fast in the US, with around 50% of the herds infected in one year [5]. As a consequence of the high mortality and morbidity caused by the disease, PEDV has generated very important economic losses in the US, i.e., after the first outbreak the loss was estimated as $1 billion [6], and recently estimated as $432 per sow [7].",

CoVs contain the largest known genome among RNA viruses, consisting of a single-stranded, positive-sense, 5\u2032-capped and polyadenylated RNA molecule that, in the case of PEDV, is around 28 kb in length [10]. PEDV mainly infects small intestinal villous enterocytes, causing acute necrosis that leads to villi atrophy [11]. This could produce severe diarrhea as a consequence of malabsorption. Often, diarrhea is accompanied by vomiting, which increases severe dehydration and anorexia. These clinical signs could lead to animal death. The severity of clinical signs caused by PEDV is inversely related to the age of animals. Clinical signs are very severe in nursing piglets, under two-weeks of age, with a mortality rate of up to 95%. In weaned to finisher pigs and pregnant sows, the clinical signs are milder and self-limiting within five to 10 days after the onset of disease [12].",

            "text": "Both inactivated and live attenuated PEDV vaccines are manufactured and have been extensively used in Asia (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/). The emergence of virulent PEDV strains in China during 2010, even in previously vaccinated farms, and in 2013 in the US points to the need for more effective vaccines. Therefore, PEDV vaccine development has been focused in the application of previously used strategies to obtain vaccine candidates derived from novel strains [13,14,15,16]. Subunit or inactivated vaccines were quickly developed, as their design and generation used to be fast and easy. Nevertheless, they have been proved non-efficient to control PEDV [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. These vaccines are only partially effective in the induction of mucosal immunity, although they have been proposed for boosting immunity in sows prior to farrowing [23,24]. Vaccination with live virus is the best strategy to induce lactogenic immunity and protection against PEDV infection of newborn piglets [25,26]. Due to the rapid spread of PEDV in the US, some veterinarians have recommended intentional infection of sows during gestation to induce lactogenic immunity (feed-back approach). It was rapidly assumed that, once a herd was infected, long-term immunity would be developed. Apart from potential risks following intentional exposure to PEDV, it leads to decreased lactogenic immune responses in herds with pre-existing immunity, being one of the less effective tools for PEDV elimination in that case [1,27]. In fact, re-infections have been frequently reported in farms applying the feed-back approach, even sometimes produced by the same PEDV strain that originally infected the herd [26,28]. On the other hand, current live attenuated vaccines did not prevent virus shedding. This could represent a biosafety problem as the vaccine strain can revert to virulence by recombination with circulating strains. In fact, such recombinant PEDV isolates have been identified in Asia [29]. Therefore, novel effective and safe vaccines against PEDV are required.",

To this end, a combination of reverse genetics systems, using infectious cDNA clones, and introduction of attenuating modifications are required. The first CoV infectious cDNA clone was engineered by our group for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) [30]. Spike (S) protein is the major structural protein in CoV envelope and is involved in receptor binding and membrane fusion [31,32,33,34]. By modifying S protein sequence, CoV tropism is altered [35,36,37,38] (C.M. Sanchez, A. Pascual-Iglesias, S. Zu\u00f1iga and L. Enjuanes, manuscript in preparation). Moreover, species tropism could also be changed by introducing S sequences in the genomes of distantly related CoVs [39,40,41,42]. In addition, S protein is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and, indeed, many CoV vaccines are based in the expression of S protein or S protein domains [23,43,44,45].",

The N terminus of the protein contained the exposed domain of PEDV S protein from a virulent US strain (Figure 1A), including the epitopes recognized by neutralizing antibodies, and the heptad-repeats domains (aa 1 to 1325). The C-terminus of the protein was that from the enteropathogenic TGEV SC11 virus [36], including the transmembrane domain and C-terminus (aa 1389 to 1448). The chimeric protein was cloned in the TGEV infectious cDNA [30], replacing TGEV S protein (rTGEV-SPEDV, Figure 1B). In addition, chimeric SPEDV-TGEV protein was cloned in an infectious cDNA from an attenuated TGEV, which contained duplications of transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) and engineered unique restrictions sites (RS) to avoid the overlapping of consecutive genes [46] (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV, Figure 1C). Recombinant viruses rTGEV-SPEDV and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV were recovered after transfection of Vero cells with the wild-type and attenuated cDNAs, respectively. These viruses required trypsin to efficiently infect Vero cells, and form syncytia, similarly to PEDV virus. Growth kinetics in cell culture was analyzed by infecting Vero cells at two multiplicities of infection (MOI)moi of 0.1 and 0.001. Both viruses reached peak titers at 28 or 48 hpi, depending on the MOI (Figure 2A). Nevertheless, rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus peak titers were five- to 10-fold lower than those for parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus (Figure 2A).",

At 6 dpi, rTGEV-SPEDV titers were slightly lower than those for rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus, suggesting a decreased number of gut epithelial cells available for reinfection. Piglets inoculated with parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus lost weight after infection (Figure 3A) and 70% died (Figure 3B). This data indicates that the chimeric rTGEV-SPEDV control virus was virulent. In contrast, animals infected with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus maintained weight (Figure 3A) and all of them survived (Figure 3B), indicating that the virus was attenuated.

Reversion to virulence or recombination with circulating strains is in the basis for the emergence of novel virulent PEDV strains, especially in Asia [29,56]. The rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus genetic stability, which may influence its safety as vaccine candidate, was evaluated in cell culture. After 15 passages in cell culture, viral genome region comprising from 3b gene to 3\u2032UTR (nucleotides 25856 to 28544) was sequenced. No changes appeared in the passed virus compared with the parental one, strongly suggesting that the engineered virus was genetically stable in cell culture. To address virus stability in vivo, the 3\u2032-ends (nt 25856 to 28544) of rTGEV-SPEDV and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV viruses were sequenced, using RNA isolated from the jejunum of five-day-old infected piglets at six days post-infection. No modifications were found in the parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus. In the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus, modifications were only detected in the engineered TRS duplicated sequences (Figure 5). Small deletions and point mutations were found between E and M genes, eliminating the engineered FseI restriction site, but maintaining duplicated sequence (Figure 5). Extensive deletion was observed between M and N genes, reverting the sequence to that of the wild-type virus (Figure 5). No changes were observed in the engineered mutations between N and 7 genes (Figure 5). Interestingly, when viral RNA was isolated from feces of 21-day-old piglets at seven days post-vaccination (see below) and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus was sequenced, the same modifications were observed. This data strongly suggests that the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV genome recovered from piglets may represent the in vivo evolution of the engineered virus. It is worth noting that TGEV attenuation was similar with the three TRSs duplications and with just the duplication between N and 7 genes [46], suggesting that in vivo evolved rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus may still be attenuated.",

Pregnant sows are the most suitable models to evaluate the effect of PEDV vaccine candidates, as the target animals are neonatal piglets, and lactogenic immunity has an important role in protection [26]. Nevertheless, availability, cost, and housing resources limited its use in preliminary vaccine candidate trials [16,18], and a young pig model has been proposed for preliminary vaccine efficacy trials [13,16]. Therefore, to evaluate the protection conferred by rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus, 21-day-old pigs were used. Group 1 (G1) was vaccinated with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus, group 2 (G2) was vaccinated with a virulent US PEDV strain (PEDV-NVSL), and two groups of animals (G3 and G4) were not vaccinated (Table 1). Twenty-one days after vaccination, animals from G1, G2, and G3 were challenged with a virulent recombinant PEDV strain (rPEDV) (Table 1). As expected, due to the animal age, no clinical sings of enteric disease such as diarrhea, vomiting, or dehydration were observed after vaccination or challenge (data not shown). Nevertheless, animals vaccinated with the virulent PEDV-NVSL strain showed a delay in weight gain the first week after vaccination, compared with non-infected animals or those vaccinated with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus (Figure 6). Similar observations were reported for other virulent US isolates [13]. These data indicate that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus was also attenuated in 21-day-old piglets.",

This result was expected, as the ELISA test was developed against the whole PEDV virus, and the chimeric rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus only expressed PEDV S protein. After challenge at 28 and 31 dpv, PEDV total antibodies increased in all challenged groups, as expected. Interestingly, the increase was slower in the vaccinated pigs, in agreement with a decreased challenge virus replication in these animals. Total anti-TGEV antibodies were also evaluated by ELISA. All animals were seronegative at the time of vaccination. When challenge was performed, the level of TGEV antibodies was not significant in any group, and the all the animals remained seronegative after PEDV challenge. This result was expected, as S protein is the main inducer of antibodies against TGEV and it was not present in any of the viruses used for vaccination or challenge. In addition, it has been shown that there is no cross-reactivity between TGEV and PEDV [58].",

These vaccines were not effective to control the infection, as they were extensively used in countries were novel PEDV strains emerged [14,15]. As a consequence, many groups have developed traditionally attenuated live vaccines based on novel epidemic PEDV strains.

It is worth noting that SeCoV was isolated from diarrheic samples in all cases, suggesting that it is virulent. The engineered parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus resembles the recombinant SeCoV and, as shown by our data, is virulent in suckling piglets. In contrast, the engineered virus (rTGEV-RS-SPEDV) used as a vaccine candidate was attenuated. There are some genetic differences that may eventually allow the discrimination between SeCoV and the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccine candidate as (i) rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus did not contain the full PEDV S gene sequence, (ii) it expressed TGEV protein 3a, and (iii) because of the TGEV strain used to engineer the infectious cDNA, it did not express TGEV protein 3b [70].",
