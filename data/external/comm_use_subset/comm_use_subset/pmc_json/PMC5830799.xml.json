            "text": "Mathematical modelling has helped to unravel some of the complexities of asymptomatic carriage and its implications for control [9,12\u201314]. For example, modelling studies of influenza [13] and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [14] found that control strategies targeting symptomatically infected hosts but not asymptomatic carriers are actually incapable of achieving disease control, even when multiple control types are implemented. Modelling has also revealed the importance of accounting for asymptomatic carriers in epidemiological models. For example, under certain conditions, neglecting pre-symptomatic influenza transmission was shown to overestimate the impact of interventions targeting symptomatically infected hosts [12]. Neglecting asymptomatic carriers in a model of Ebola virus transmission was shown to significantly overestimate the projected cumulative incidence of symptomatic infections, as well as overestimate the population-level vaccination coverage needed to contain epidemics [9]. Accordingly, if carriage is not appropriately represented in mathematical models, there is a risk that they may incorrectly assess the viability of an intervention, potentially leading to missed opportunities for controlling disease or, conversely, the implementation of an ineffective intervention. Therefore, without sufficient knowledge of asymptomatic carriers the parametrization and validation of mathematical models is compromised. More fundamentally, this uncertainty also undermines the choice of model used to represent the transmission and natural history of an infectious disease, as evidenced by the variation in model structure observed across mathematical modelling studies of MRSA [14\u201322]. This uncertainty in the underlying structure of mathematical models of infectious diseases with asymptomatic carriers casts further doubt on evaluations of interventions from mathematical models, potentially hindering the decision-making process of policy-makers.",

To address this need, here we review existing mathematical models of infectious disease transmission for the purpose of identifying the types of model structures that are used to describe transmission with asymptomatic carriers. Based on this review, we define a new model of pathogen transmission that enables us to systematically compare the behaviour of alternative model structures and how they influence the estimated impact of control interventions. First, we analyse this model to establish the contribution of asymptomatic carriers to measures of pathogen transmission, the prevalence of symptomatic infections and the total infection (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) prevalence. We then consider how excluding asymptomatic carriers from this model could lead to the misinterpretation of data and the conditions under which this obscures the most important drivers of pathogen transmission. Finally, we evaluate the impact of a range of interventions on transmission and the prevalence of disease, and discuss how the choice of model structure might affect the assessment of these interventions.",

Examples of this type of intervention are the multivalent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines. These vaccines only protect against about 10% of this pathogen\u2019s 90 identified serotypes. Those included in the vaccine are selected for their predominance as causes of invasive pneumococcal disease, allowing less virulent (carriage) strains to persist [23], essentially reducing the relative incidence of symptomatic infections versus asymptomatic carriage. Our study provides a better understanding of the dynamic behaviour of models that include asymptomatic carriers, will inform more appropriate design of future models and contribute to a more complete understanding of the impact of asymptomatic carriage on pathogen dynamics.",

Following the method outlined in [26], a fraction h1=\u03c4/(\u03c4+\u03be\u03b3) of asymptomatic carriers progress to symptomatic infection, and a fraction h2=\u03c9/(\u03c9+\u03b3) of symptomatic infections regress to asymptomatic carriage. Hence, a fraction h1 of newly infected asymptomatic carriers progress to symptomatic infection at least once, a fraction h12h2 progress to symptomatic infection at least twice and a fraction h1kh2k\u22121 of newly infected asymptomatic carriers progress to symptomatic infection at least k times, spending an average of g1=1/(\u03c9+\u03b3) time units with symptoms per instance of symptomatic infection. Similarly, all newly infected asymptomatic carriers experience asymptomatic infection at least once, a fraction h1h2 experience asymptomatic infection at least twice and a fraction h1kh2k of newly infected asymptomatic carriers experience asymptomatic infection at least k times, spending an average of g2=1/(\u03c4+\u03be\u03b3) time units without symptoms during each instance of asymptomatic carriage. Thus a newly infected asymptomatic carrier spends on average g1(h1+h12h2+\u22ef)=g1h1/(1\u2212h1h2)=\u03c4/((\u03c4+\u03be\u03b3)(\u03b3+\u03b3\u03c9\u03be/(\u03c4+\u03be\u03b3))) time units with symptomatic infection, and g2(1+h1h2+h12h22+\u22ef)=g2/(1\u2212h1h2)=1/(\u03b3\u03be+\u03b3\u03c4/(\u03c9+\u03b3)) time units with asymptomatic carriage over its expected lifetime. Multiplying these two terms by the respective transmission rates \u03b2 (from symptomatic infections) and \u03b7\u03b2 (from asymptomatic carriers), and summing gives RC. A similar argument can be made to heuristically derive RI (for the formal derivation of R0 see electronic supplementary material, appendix B).",

Numerous studies documented the subsequent declining rates of asymptomatic carriage of PCV7 serotypes and of overall invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among young children [23,33], although the overall incidence of asymptomatic carriage remained relatively stable [34]. Overall reductions in the incidence of IPD were also observed in non-vaccinated adults [23,33], although these were accompanied by increases in the overall rates of asymptomatic carriage [34]. The mechanisms behind the extended response to the PCV7 vaccine beyond the vaccinated populations which affected childhood and adult asymptomatic carriage and IPD rates differently are not well understood. However, it has been suggested that both serotype replacement and a decrease in herd immunity from reduced exposure to asymptomatic carriers may play a role in the population-level impact of the PCV7 vaccine [35,36]. Similar mechanisms are also suggested to be behind the extended response beyond the vaccinated populations to the subsequently introduced 13-valent S. pneumoniae vaccine [33]. Recently, IPD incidence has begun to increase in populations in the United Kingdom, particularly among persons 5\u201364 and greater than 65 years of age, and despite the ever-increasing proportion of the population obtaining direct protection through vaccination [37]. Serotype replacement, in conjunction with changes to the invasiveness of the non-vaccine strains, is a possible explanation [37].",

Accordingly, patterns of pathogen transmission may also be expected to vary between host settings. MRSA and Streptococcus pyogenes, for example, have mostly commensal interactions with humans and occasionally cause symptomatic skin infections. When such pathogens are transmitted in environments with high rates of host injury (e.g. healthcare settings or regions where other contagious skin diseases like human scabies are endemic [38]), it is conceivable that infected hosts will probably have an increased chance of developing symptoms compared to other environments with lower host-injury rates and lower chances of hosts having breakages in their skin [15]. Our analytical results suggest that different patterns of pathogen transmission may be occurring in these different host settings, and that the effect of controls may also vary across host settings.",

Outside healthcare settings, community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has emerged globally and independently of HA-MRSA [40]. One explanation for the sustained transmission of CA-MRSA outside healthcare settings is that it has a higher fitness in the community than HA-MRSA [40]. Our results indicate that the high reproduction potential of asymptomatic carriers is also likely to be playing a role in the transmission of CA-MRSA in the community. Thus carriers should be targets for control, as has been suggested previously [15].",

In fact, children in remote Indigenous communities in northern Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands have the highest prevalence of skin sores caused by S. pyogenes in the world [38]. These communities are characterized by higher host-injury rates and poorer host health compared to communities where S. pyogenes has a much lower prevalence. From our analytical results, we can deduce that asymptomatic carriers of S. pyogenes have a lower reproduction potential than symptomatically infected hosts, because increasing the proportion of symptomatic infections across host settings corresponds to an increase in prevalence.",

First, it applies to only those pathogens for which asymptomatic carriers are infectious, clearance of infection is possible and does not confer lifelong immunity, and infection does not alter the death rate of hosts. These restrictions mean that our results are not relevant to two of humanity\u2019s leading causes of death attributable to a single infectious agent \u2013 Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV [41]. A natural extension of our work is to consider how relaxing these constraints affects our study\u2019s conclusions to gain insight into the transmission of these important human pathogens. Second, our model assumes the homogeneous mixing of hosts and it does not consider strain diversity. However, for pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes age-assortative mixing and strain diversity are likely to be key drivers of observed transmission dynamics [36,42]. Therefore, it is also of interest to explore the implications of asymptomatic carriage in more complex model structures.",
