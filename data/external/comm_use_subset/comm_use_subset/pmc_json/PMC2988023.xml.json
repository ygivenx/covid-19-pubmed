It is thought that SARS-CoV might originate from its natural reservoir bats and transmit to humans through an intermediate such as palm civets and raccoon dogs, and no one can exclude the possibility of its recurrence [1].",

The S protein was considered as an important target for developing diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics [4-12]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein was defined as a fragment corresponding to the residues 318 - 510 of the S protein, which mediates viral binding to cell receptor ACE2 [13-15]. Coincidently, we identified the RBD as a major target of neutralizing antibodies [16-19], and proposed it as an ideal vaccine antigen for clinical application [20-22]. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of RBD-based vaccine candidates have been evaluated in animal models [17,23-25]. However, the antigenicity and immunogenicity of RBD in humans need to be characterized in detail toward developing the RBD-based vaccines and diagnostics. In this short communication, we found that patients recovered from SARS developed potent and persistent RBD-specific antibody responses, highlighting the potentials of clinical applications of RBD-based vaccines and diagnostics.",

The serum samples were diluted at 1:10 according to the manufacturer's instruction. The results are presented in Figure 2. The RBD-specific antibodies maintain relatively higher titers through 3 year follow-up. At year 2 and year 3, only one same sample became undetectable and thus gave a positive rate of 94.74%. However, the ELISA results from the kit showed much low reactivity. Compared to the RBD-based results, the OD values for all samples dropped dramatically at year 2 and 3. Specially, the positive percentage of the year 3 samples was only 42.11% (8/19), suggesting the viral lysate-based ELISA kit had much low sensitivity than the RBD-based ELISA.",

To this end, we purified RBD-specific antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography from four SARS serum samples selected from the convalescent-phase SARS patients 30-60 days after onset of illness during the 2003 Beijing outbreak. The fusion protein RBD-Fc was coupled to cyanogenbromide-activated Sepharose beads and the serum sample was flowed through the bead column to absorb the RBD-specific antibodies. Figure 3A shows that the purified RBD-specific antibodies from SARS patients strongly reacted with RBD-His antigen. Then, we tested their neutralizing activity against SARS pseudoviruses.

            "text": "One of our previous major findings is that the RBD of S protein serves as a main antigenic site that mediates neutralizing antibody responses [12,16-18,28-33]. We have clearly demonstrated that the RBD contains multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes [16,18] and that RBD-based immunogens can induce potent neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity [16,17,23-25,29,30,34]. Based on these observations we have proposed RBD-based SARS vaccines [20-22]. However, our previous studies were primarily based on the animal models. Toward developing a safe and effective RBD-based vaccine one fundamental question is that whether the RBD is immunogenic and functional for neutralizing antibodies in humans. In our ongoing preclinical studies, the immunogenicity of RBD immunogens will be evaluated in non-human primates. In the present study, we firstly investigated the RBD-specific antibody responses in subjects recovered from SARS-CoV infection as an alternative way to evaluate RBD vaccine in humans. With a recombinant RBD protein as an ELISA antigen, we showed that the spike RBD could induce potent and persistent antibody responses in the recovered patients (Figure 1 and 2); with a RBD-Fc fusion protein in the immunoaffinity column, the anti-RBD antibodies purified from the positive human serum samples possessed potent neutralizing activity (Figure 3). Therefore, these data verify the functionality of SARS-CoV RBD in infected subjects and highlight RBD-based vaccines for human application.",

Although a number of antigens, including proteins or peptides, have been proposed for SARS-CoV serodiagnosis, the first and only serological diagnostic kit in China is based on the viral lysates-derived antigen. Our results also demonstrated that the lysate-based ELISA kit showed much lower reactivity with human positive sera while compared to the RBD-based ELISA (Figure 2). We were not surprised by the kit-based results since similar serological data were previously reported [35,36]. By using the same brand kit in a follow-up study, Wu et al reported that the average OD values dropped to 0.25 by year 3 and gave a positive rate of 55.56% [35], consistent with the present results. Therefore, the clinical application of the viral lysate-based ELISA kit might be limited by its sensitivity and specificity, and development of novel improved approaches for SARS-CoV serodiagnosis remains to be a priority. The S protein RBD-based methods can be further explored as the RBD specifically mediates receptor-binding and is a major antigenic sites in both animals and humans.",
