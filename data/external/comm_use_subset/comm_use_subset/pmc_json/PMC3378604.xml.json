Entomological data play an especially important role in the certification of elimination following the cessation of treatment, as the prevalence of infective stages of the parasite in the fly population is the timeliest measure of transmission in a given area. However, demonstrating that transmission is interrupted requires that large numbers of flies be tested. For example, current OEPA guidelines require that the prevalence of flies carrying infective larvae (L3) be less than 1/2000 in every sentinel community for transmission to be interrupted [5]. In order to be able to state with a 95% confidence that the prevalence of infective flies is less that 1/2000 requires examining approximately 6000 flies from each sentinel community. Examining such large numbers of insects using conventional methods (dissection) is impractical. For this reason, the current guidelines recommend the use of pool screening PCR based methods to conduct the entomological studies necessary to document transmission interruption [4].",

Algorithms have been developed that permit one to derive a point estimate of the prevalence of infection in the fly population (and an associated confidence interval) from the number of PCR positive pools and the number of flies contained in each pool [7]. Furthermore, because the infective stage of the parasite is the only form found in the black fly head capsule, separated pools of heads and bodies may be screened to obtain estimates of the prevalence of infective flies (flies with infective stages in their head) and the prevalence of infected flies (flies with immature larval stages in their bodies). This approach has been used to monitor transmission of O. volvulus in many foci of Latin America and Africa [8]\u2013[11], as well as to certify the interruption of transmission in foci on both continents [5], [12]\u2013[14].",

Thus, in situations where pool screening is used to certify transmission interruption (where infective flies are extremely rare or non-existent) the pool size is only limited by the biochemical constraints of the assay. The current method of DNA extraction for the O-150 PCR assay is based upon adsorption to a silica matrix [16]. This preparation results in DNA samples that still contain inhibitors of the PCR, limiting the number of flies that may be included in each pool. Currently, pool sizes are limited to 50 individual heads or bodies (in the case of flies from Latin America) [9] or 100 individual heads or bodies (in the case of flies from Africa) [7]. Developing alternative methods to prepare DNA that would permit an increase in the maximum number of heads or bodies in each pool would decrease the cost and effort necessary to screen the requisite large numbers of flies necessary to certify transmission interruption.",

However, because it will be possible to increase the size of the pools 2\u20134 fold when using the capture assay, a reduction in labor costs of between 50% and 75% would be realized when costs are considered on a per-fly-tested basis. Similarly, the per-sample cost of carrying out the conventional assay is roughly $2.22 per pool, while the cost of the magnetic bead assay is $3.81 per pool. However, because the magnetic bead permits more flies to be tested per pool, cost savings in reagents are realized when the costs are amortized on a per fly basis (Table 3).",

Thus, the size of pools used in a pool screening protocol is more likely to be limited by the biochemistry of the detection assay than by the underlying statistical uncertainties associated with screening pools of samples. This is particularly true when positive samples are extremely rare, as in the case when monitoring for transmission interruption. The data presented above suggest that the oligonucleotide capture method of purifying O. volvulus DNA is superior to the conventional silica adsorption method. Mixing experiments have demonstrated that PCR inhibitors carried through the silica adsorption process limits the size of the pools that may be screened to 50 individual flies for S. ochraceum and 100 for S. damnosum s.l (data not shown). The oligonucleotide capture method appears to result in DNA preparations that are freer of PCR inhibitors than are those prepared using silica adsorption. The practical result of this improvement is that it permits a 2 to 4-fold increase in the number of black fly heads or bodies that can be included in a single pool. This increase in pool size results in a dramatic cost savings in the per-unit cost of the O-150 pool screen assay. Using the oligonucleotide capture assay, labor costs are reduced by 50\u201375%, while the overall cost of reagents needed is $3.81 per pool of 200 flies or less than $0.02 per individual fly. The decrease in cost and corresponding increase in the efficiency of the assay will make it more practical to screen the large numbers of flies necessary to demonstrate transmission interruption and to certify elimination of onchocerciasis.",

Thus, the standard O-150 PCR will amplify sequences present in all Onchocerca species, including Onchocerca ochengi, a cattle parasite that is sympatric with O. volvulus in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, the O-150 PCR is made species or strain specific by modifying the amplification conditions to limit amplification to species specific members of the O-150 repeat family [23] or by the use of species or strain specific probes to detect the resulting amplicons [8]. However the oligonucleotide used in the capture assay (OVS2) has previously been shown to hybridize specifically to O. volvulus under appropriate conditions [22]. It is therefore possible that modification of the current capture conditions could result in a purification process that would specifically capture O. volvulus but not O. ochengi genomic DNA. This would provide an extra layer of specificity to the assay when it is employed in areas where O. volvulus and O. ochengi are sympatric.",
