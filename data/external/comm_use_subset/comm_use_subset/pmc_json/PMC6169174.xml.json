Lack of diagnostic capacity, similarity of influenza presentation with common febrile illnesses such as malaria and bacterial pneumonia, and prioritization of other high-burden public health problems are likely contributory factors. A recent systematic review concluded that most of the sub-Saharan African countries had insufficient epidemiological data to develop rational strategies for influenza prevention and control.2 It is, therefore, unsurprising that although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccine for high-risk groups, such as young children, pregnant women, and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u2013infected individuals,3 few African countries have implemented these recommendations or have national policies.4",

Consequently, most individuals requiring hospitalization from this community will present to QECH. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence in Blantyre is estimated at 17.7%,12 but up to 74% of patients admitted to the QECH medical wards are HIV infected.13 Malaria is endemic in Malawi (peak transmission months January to June), and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positivity is 8% among adult inpatients at QECH.14 Lower respiratory tract infections are the commonest cause of medical admission at QECH.13 There is no national influenza vaccination policy in Malawi.

The latter was recorded on the Surveillance Program of Inpatients and Epidemiology (SPINE) electronic data collection system.13 The annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI per 100,000 persons was estimated using the adjusted number of medically attended influenza-positive SARIs, divided by the census estimates of Blantyre District population aged \u2265 15 years for each year,18 and multiplied by 100,000. Incidence by HIV status was also calculated for individuals aged 15\u201349 years (in whom HIV prevalence is available18). Human immunodeficiency virus\u2013associated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by dividing the incidence in HIV-infected strata by the incidence in HIV-uninfected strata. 95% Confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence estimates and HIV-associated IRRs were calculated using the Poisson distribution.",

Furthermore, the latter two studies included children aged 5\u201314 years, a group that typically has higher rates of influenza infection.9,24 It is important to stress that our incidence estimates represent minimum estimates because our surveillance only detected persons accessing care at QECH.

This likely reflects the different spectra of organisms affecting HIV-infected adults, with greater relative contribution of opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, rather than a lower absolute risk. This has also been described in HIV-infected children30 and adults10 in South Africa. In fact, after taking into account population denominators, HIV-infected adults aged 15\u201349 years had a 5-fold greater incidence of influenza-positive SARI than HIV-uninfected adults. Having comprehensively ascertained HIV status, our study corroborates with studies in Malawi, Kenya, and South Africa that have identified HIV as a major risk factor for influenza burden25 and severe disease.24,31,32 These results suggest that early HIV testing and expanded access to antiretroviral treatment, in addition to targeted influenza vaccination, could potentially have a substantial impact on burden of SARI in urban Blantyre and other similar high HIV prevalence settings. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for HIV-infected individuals.3 Influenza vaccination in HIV-infected adults is safe and effective (pooled efficacy 85%),33 but influenza vaccines are currently unavailable in most African countries.4,34",

There is growing recognition that viruses other than influenza, such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza viruses, can cause clinically severe disease. However, whereas the detection of influenza, RSV, and hMPV in adults with SARI likely indicates an etiologic role,38,39 the presence of other respiratory viruses is of uncertain significance, particularly as we did not enroll accompanying controls.

Although there are no other large inpatient facilities in Blantyre, we have not sampled from elsewhere in Malawi. Second, limiting recruitment to the first four cases of the day could have resulted in selection bias because individuals who present to hospital at different times of the day may have varying characteristics, such as health-seeking behavior or distance of residence from hospital. Third as discussed earlier, patients with SARI could have sought health care in facilities other than QECH, leading to an underestimation of our influenza-associated SARI rates. Under-ascertainment of SARI cases and resultant underestimation of incidence were also possible if SARI cases were not systematically recorded onto SPINE. Fourth, although we had near-complete ascertainment of HIV status (98.5%), data on CD4+ cell count and antiretroviral treatment status were not available. Comorbidities were also poorly recorded; thus, we were unable to evaluate chronic lung disease as a potential risk factor for influenza or adjust for underlying comorbidities in the multivariable analysis for clinical severity. Last, data on hospitalization and mortality were not systematically captured. Instead, we used the MEWS score as a surrogate marker for clinical severity. The score has been widely used in developed health-care settings to identify patients at risk of deterioration, and a threshold of greater than four is predictive of inpatient mortality.19 It has also been validated in other African settings.21,22",
