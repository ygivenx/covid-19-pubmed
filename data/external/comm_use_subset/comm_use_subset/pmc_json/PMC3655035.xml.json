Of the 10 million deaths of children less than five years of age throughout the world, 1.9 million children died from ILI in the year 2000 [3]. Although the incidence of ILI is similar in both developed and developing countries, the mortality rates are higher in developing countries, such as China [4]. The elderly and individuals with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems have the greatest risk of serious complications from ILI, which can be caused by any one of approximately 200 known viral species [5]. Among these viruses are well-recognized respiratory viral pathogens, including seasonal influenza virus A and B (sFluA and sFluB), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (ADV). Patients infected by these diverse viral pathogens exhibit widely overlapping symptoms, rendering clinical diagnosis unreliable while severely limiting etiological and epidemiological studies.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are 3\u20135 million severe cases and 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths globally due to influenza annually [6]. ADV are responsible for approximately 7\u20138% of reported childhood viral respiratory infections globally [7,8] and cause a broad spectrum of clinical disease, including respiratory tract infection, pharyngoconjunctival fever, conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and gastroenteritis. Although most infections are self-limited, ADV has been associated with severe and even fatal infections in both immunocompromised and healthy individuals [9-11]. In an immunocompromised host, ADV can cause severe localized disease or disseminated disease with multi-organ failure [12,13]. RSV can cause severe infections in infants and young children and is the leading cause of bronchiolitis in children under one year of age in the United States [14-17]. RSV outbreaks are responsible for a significant increase in hospital admissions during the winter season [15]. In 2005, at least 3.4 million cases of severe RSV-associated ARI requiring hospital admission occurred worldwide and between 66,000\u2013199,000 children younger than five years of age died from RSV-associated ARI [18]. The signs and symptoms of HMPV infection are similar to those for RSV [19]. Since it was first described, HMPV has been reported in regions from around the world, with an incidence ranging from 3.9\u201343% [20-27]. PIV is an important cause of upper and lower respiratory tract illness, especially among children [3,28,29].",

However, in China, the epidemiology of viral etiology for ILI is poorly understood and there is only a paucity of data on whether climate factors affect disease incidence and prevalence. A laboratory-based influenza-like illness surveillance system is well established in Zhuhai city and has greatly contributed to the control of influenza virus infection due to advanced warning of outbreaks. Since 2004, seasonal influenza incidence rates have been monitored by detection of influenza viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs of patients presenting with ILI. The aim of the current study was to gain insight into the epidemiology of viral etiology responsible for ILI and whether any correlations exist between the incidences of these viral pathogens and meteorological parameters in Zhuhai city. PIV-1, PIV-2 PIV-3, RSV, HMPV, as well as sFluA (H1N1 and H3N2), sFluB, and H1N1pdm09 were detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and ADV was identified by real-time PCR in Zhuhai during 2010. This study provides clinicians with helpful information about the etiological patterns of patients presenting with complaints of acute respiratory symptoms.",

Of 3,747 outpatients with ILI, 924 (24.66%) had available samples and were enrolled in this study and ranged in age from one month to 78 years. Only two patients were older than 60 years of age, while 536 (58.01%) were under five years old and 308 (33.33%) were between the ages of 5\u201314. The age distribution of the 924 study participants was representative of the 3,747 patients presenting with ILI (Figure 1). This susceptibility of ILI in the younger age categories may be caused by several reasons. First, the immune system of children under five years old is naive and more susceptible of viral infections. Second, juveniles between the ages of 5\u201314 are generally students who are densely-gathered in schools promoting the spread of respiratory infectious. In addition, their immune systems are also still in development. Third, although aging impacts immunity to viral infection [30], patients older than 60 years of age usually have some comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, or chronic bronchitis, and seek medical attention only when these primary diseases worsen when combined with ARI. Moreover, elderly people may self-administer according to their own experience. Of 924 samples, about 44.48% were positive for at least one virus, which is consistent with previous studies where viruses were detected in a range between 36% and 58% [31-34]. Among the tested viral pathogens, influenza virus, RSV, and HMPV exhibited characteristic seasonal patterns. In addition, there were correlations between the incidence of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV with air temperature, as well as between incidence of sFluB and air humidity. Therefore, the knowledge from our study is important for planning and implementation of effective interventions, including vaccinations.",

It is possible that the epidemic of H1N1pdm09 interfered with the appearance of sFluA (H1N1). The incidence of H1N1pdm09 was highest in adults between 25\u201359 years of age in 2010 (10.91%), with significant differences compared to other age groups (P = 0.033). Of the total cases of ILI, 10.39% were infected with sFluB, which was the predominant viral pathogen and occurred mainly from February\u2013May in 2010, corresponding with a previous study of seasonal patterns [35]. Among 308 patients between 5\u201314 years of age, 66 (21.43%) were infected with sFluB and there was a significant difference in age distribution (P < 0.001). Infection with sFluA (H3N2) occurred predominantly in children less than five years old, which was significantly higher than other age groups (P = 0.009). In addition, the rate of sFluA (H3N2) + RSV was the most common viral co-infection in the respiratory tract of patients with ILI. In accordance with a previous study [36], the seasonal variability of sFluA (H3N2) was clear, presenting mainly from July\u2013October, perhaps influenced by the epidemic of H1N1pdm09. We found that influenza strains were the most commonly detected viruses in agreement with other studies [37]. In addition, two significant correlations were observed; first, the higher the air temperature, the higher the incidence of sFluA (H3N2) (r = 0.592, P = 0.043), and second, the incidence of sFluB positively correlated with air relative humidity (r = 0.866, P < 0.001).",

Although the study by van den Hoogen et al.[40] showed that most HMPV infections occur in children less than five years of age, our study did not show a significant difference in age distribution of HMPV infections. Previous studies indicate that the activity of HMPV in temperate climates peaks between December and February [24,41], where as in subtropics it peaks in the spring and summer months [42] and the peak of HMPV activity often coincides with or follows that of RSV [21,23]. In this study from Zhuhai city, located in subtropics, the incidence of HMPV peaked in January and did not follow that of RSV. HMPV infection did not correlate with air temperature unlike RSV, which is similar to another study [43] and was likely impacted by the circulation of H1N1pbm09 virus in Zhuhai city 2010.",
