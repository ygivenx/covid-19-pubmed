            "text": "The identification of conformational epitopes in antibody-antigen interaction is a crucial step for the rational design of novel drugs and vaccines. The most direct experimental method to accurately define an epitope is to determine the 3D structure of the antibody-antigen complex by X-ray crystallography11\u20135 however these methods are time-consuming and need purified protein complexes. An alternative approach makes use of screening biological peptide libraries with antibodies to identify peptides that mimic conformational epitopes. 6\u20138 A library of peptides is generated by filamentous phages that display a random set of peptides on their surfaces. The antigen binding site on the antibody, used in the screening, will select those peptides from the random phase libraries that have a subset of similar residues in common with the conformational epitope of the antigen. In iterative procedures of biopanning the libraries with the antibody of interest, residues important for binding can then be enriched in the phage sequences. Phage display methods have been shown to experimentally identify residues critical for antigen-antibody interactions. 6\u201314 It has been shown that the peptides obtained from random phage libraries can mimic conformational epitopes, thus they are also referred as mimotopes. 9,13\u201317 The peptide sequences of mimotopes are found quite often be different from those of the natural antigen, thus the assignment of conformational epitopes from the peptide sequences can not be done by sequence alignment of the selected peptides with the sequence of the antigen. Conformational epitopes are formed in most cases by a small group of amino acid residues scattered along the protein sequence yet form contiguous clusters of residues on the protein surface.9,17,18 Methods using only the linear sequence of the antigen are thus not applicable in most cases.",

EpiSearch is based on a patch analysis that identifies spatial contiguous clusters of residues on the surface of the antigen with similar physical-chemical properties as found in the phage display sequences. Similarity of residues is measured by a physical-chemical property distance that was derived from five descriptors of amino acid residues.19\u201324 The performance of the EpiSearch algorithm has been tested for six experimental data sets of phage display experiments and compared to the conformational epitopes as found by the X-ray crystal structures of the corresponding antibody-antigen complexes. The highest-scoring patch of EpiSearch was found in all the test cases overlapping with the experimentally observed conformational epitopes, and the predicted conformational epitopes cover in most cases more than 50% residues of the conformational epitopes. In the online version of the EpiSearch method, users can map a single consensus sequence or up to thirty peptide sequences at a time. The output results from EpiSearch are displayed in a table and automatically mapped on the 3D structure using Jmol molecule viewer.25",

Therefore, in a protein with N solvent accessible residues, we have N number of surface patches, labeled k = 1, ..., N. The solvent accessible surface area of each residue is calculated by GetArea26 with a probe radius of 1.4\u00c5. A residue is considered to be solvent exposed if its solvent accessible surface area is greater than 10\u00c52 otherwise the residues are considered as buried in the protein.22,24 The surface exposed residues are represented by their C\u03b2 atom (C\u03b1 atom in case of Gly residue). Using the C\u03b2 position of each residue (C\u03b1 atom in case of Gly residue), a surface patch of radius R is drawn around each surface exposed residues. The frequency distribution of amino acid residues in each patch is calculated and saved into a second matrix mat2 (N, 20). A patch size of radius 12\u00c5 was used for all calculations with EpiSearch. Empirically, a patch size of radius 12\u00c5 was chosen to cover the surface area of all the residues present in the input peptide sequences (in most of the test cases the input peptide sequence is 12 residues long). An increase of the patch size may increase the sensitivity of the method but at the same time it will also decrease the precision of the method. On other hand a decrease in patch size may predict a smaller number of residues and therefore decrease the sensitivity of the method.",

We used a cutoff value of PD = 8.0 as the criterion to have matching residues between phage display sequences and surface patches.

Most of these predicted residues are correct, as shown in red in Figure 3C, and only a few residues of the experimentally determined epitope are not predicted (shown in blue). The second highest scoring patch at residue C214 was located on the other face of the HER-2, and is not part of the interface of the antibody\u2014Her-2/neu complex. However both the patches share a large fraction of amino acids present in the input peptide sequences. This patch is also predicted as one of the top rank cluster in Mapitope analysis.17",

Bo2C11 is a human anti FVIII monoclonal antibody that binds to C2 domain of FVIII, an essential cofactor in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Deficiency of FVIII results in bleeding disorder commonly known as hemophilia A. 9,31\u201333 We used a list of 27 peptides each 12 residue long selected against mAb Bo2C11 targeting the C2 domain of FVIII.31 Using the X-ray crystal structure of the C2 domain of FVIII34 (PDB id:1IQD), EpiSearch method predicted a potential epitope on the C2 domain of FVIII that correspond to a patch centered at the residue R2220 with the highest score (0.937). The predicted residues form a large part of the conformational epitope as determined by the X-ray crystal structure of the Bo2C11 mAb-C2 domain (Fig. 4A). The residue R2220 is completely buried at the Fab interface and forms a salt bridge with the residue D102 on the Fab Bo2C11 while residues H2315 and Q2316 play an important role in polar interactions at the antibody interface.34 Other three patches predicted by EpiSearch method are centered on the residues P2205 (Score: 0.881), E2228 (Score: 0.804) and Y2195 (Score: 0.769) respectively.

Table 1 gives an overview of the accuracy of EpiSearch method and shows that the method correctly predicted the location of conformational epitopes. Despite the low sequence similarity among the input peptide sequences, the residues in the highest scoring patch shared approximately 70% sequence identity with the residues in the input peptide sequences. In our analysis, we observed that, though all the residues in the input peptide sequences were not present in the epitope binding sites, a highest scoring patch correctly predicted the location of the conformational epitopes as found in the crystal structure. Except in case of mAb 17b peptides, the extent of coverage to locate the conformational epitope site in all the test cases was found to be more than 50% (Table 1). In case of mAb 17b the second high scoring patch performed better than the top scoring patch. The second high scoring patch partially overlapped with the top scoring patch and contained seven of the eleven residues present in the mAb 17b interface. In case of Trastuzumab, mAb 17b, mAb b12 and mAb 13b5 peptides, we also determined the influence of terminal cysteine (Cys) residues on the quality of the results. Experimentally, the terminal cysteine residues were introduced to constrain the peptides to a cyclic structure and might influence the selection process. We observed that in most of the cases the result was not sensitive to the presence of the Cys as terminal residues. However, in the case of mAb 17b bound gp120 the constrained loop peptides gave a better result than the analysis performed without the terminal Cys residues, which is evident from the presence of a Cys residue in the epitope binding site of gp120.35,36",

The EpiSearch method assumes that all peptides that are selected during the bio-panning process use a subset of the actual antigen-antibody interactions, and that the ensemble of all sequences sample most of favourable interactions in the protein-antibody interface. Therefore only surface patches that have a relative high number of matching residues for all peptide sequences are selected in our prediction process. We also assume that some of the physical pair interactions in the protein-antibody interface can be replaced by residue pairs with similar physicochemical properties, e.g. hydrophobic interactions, polar-polar or charge-charge interactions. Thus our method does not only match residues of identical types, but also residues with similar physicochemical properties, i.e. with low PD values.",

The phage display technique first introduced by G. Smith49 has been successfully used to screen a large peptide libraries that binds to a specific antibody. Simple comparison of the linear sequences of the selected peptides to the sequence of the antigen is in most cases not possible, as the peptides selected from the phage display experiment represent discontinuous fragments of amino acids that may not have a high sequence homology to the antigen.

The algorithm defines the statistically significant pairs of amino acids (AAP) by calculating the distance between two C\u03b1 atoms of adjacent residues. The AAP can be considered if the distance between to consecutive C\u03b1 is less than a given threshold value, D (the distance between alpha carbon of any given pair). Each peptide sequence obtained from the phage libraries are deconvoluted into AAPs and the most significant pairs were mapped on the protein surface. A new version of Enshell et al algorithm known as Mapitope,17 is available which depends on the selection of the distance between C\u03b1 atoms of any given pair and the statistical threshold values. Other methods, Findmap,53 3DEX16 and MIMOX33 uses one peptide sequence (or a consensus peptide sequence) at a time while PepSurf 37,42 becomes highly CPU time intensive when longer peptides are used37 and the performance of the MIMOP9 relies on the multiple sequence alignment of peptide sequences. The ability of the EpiSearch method to predict genuine epitope binding site on the antigen surface was also tested using a single peptide sequence as well as a group of three, five and if possible nine, fourteen and twenty sequences. As shown in Table 1, the EpiSearch method correctly mapped the location of conformation epitopes. However, subtle differences were observed when the input peptide sequences shared a low sequence identity.16,17,33,42",

Based on tested examples shown here the average processing time is about one minute which may vary depending on the size of the input protein data file used. Also the EpiSearch method is flexible enough and allows the user to vary the cut off value for solvent accessible surface area of amino acids and the patch size. For example, in the case of Trastuzumab peptides, the method correctly predicts six residues using a 10\u00c5 patch size and three residues using a patch size of 8\u00c5 compared to nine residues using a patch size of 12\u00c5. Similarly, in the case of mAb Bo2C11, the method correctly predicts five residues using a patch size of 10\u00c5 compared to seven residues using a patch size of 12\u00c5. A further decrease in patch size predicts only four residues. A patch size below 10\u00c5 can accommodate fewer residues present in the 12-mer peptide and therefore recommends to use peptide sequences up to seven (7-mer) or nine (9-mer) residues long. The results obtained from the web server are shown interactively in a tabular form as well on the protein surface using JMOL molecular viewer.25 In addition, using the information about the surface exposed residues, EpiSearch method can be used to design peptides that might interfere with protein-protein interactions. Also, we hope that the results obtained from the EpiSearch method in combination with the information available from site directed mutagenesis will provide a vital resource to understand the nature of the antigen-antibody interaction in greater details.
