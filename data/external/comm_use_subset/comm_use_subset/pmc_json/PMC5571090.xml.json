At least one respiratory virus was detected in 54.6% of the samples; Influenzavirus A/B was the most common virus detected and only 9 (3.5%) patients were RSV-positive12. Between August 2009 and October 2010, samples from 292 patients of all ages admitted to two Lao hospitals (in Vientiane Capital and Northern Luang Prabang Province) with ALRI were collected for respiratory pathogen investigations13. Human rhinovirus and RSV were the most frequent viruses detected, in 35% and 26% of patients, respectively. RSV was found in all age groups but was more frequent in children under 5 years old.

Death, stay in ICU, oxygen use and severe pneumoniae were considered as indicators for severity. However, the mortality rate was too low to be analyzed and the analyses of ICU stay and oxygen use did not provide any added-value, so ultimately severe pneumonia alone was analyzed as an indicator of severe outcome. Data were double entered into an Access database (Microsoft Corporation). Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For comparison of categorical data, the Pearson Chi-square (\u03c72) test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used as appropriate. The ANOVA test was applied to compare continuous variables. We fitted a binary logistic regression model, including a stepwise selection procedure, to assess predictive factors for severity. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.",

This is consistent with the association of RSV infection with the rainy season reported in studies elsewhere in the tropics15, 18, 19. The explanation for this consistent association is unclear. It could be directly related to climatic factors, such as increased humidity, or reflect changes in social behaviour which may enhance transmission8, 19. Recently, Paynter reported that the wet conditions of the tropical rainy season may encourage contact transmission of this virus by increasing the amount of virus on surfaces and by increasing virus survival in droplets on surfaces20. However, other patterns of RSV seasonality in tropical areas have been described. There were peaks of RSV-associated hospitalization observed during cool periods from 2011 to 2014 in Bangladesh21. Substantial differences in geography and climate are present in Laos, especially between the south and the north of the country, and therefore additional data, collected over several years and from different areas, are required to fully describe the seasonality of RSV infection in Laos.",

All five deaths were in the group with severe pneumonia, and four cases occurred in children less than one year old. This mortality is lower than the estimate of 3% to 9% associated with RSV infection reported by Nair et al.25. Beliefs and practices when death is approaching are different in each country. In Southeast Asian culture, relatives usually wish children that they expect to die, to die at home26. This belief leads to discharge just before death, and hence may be a reason for the low apparent mortality rate in this study.",
