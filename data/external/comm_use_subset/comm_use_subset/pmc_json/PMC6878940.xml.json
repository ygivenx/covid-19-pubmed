While all IFN-\u03bbs signal through a unique IFNLR1:IL10R\u03b2 receptor complex, they activate a gene signature similar to type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 (1). Both type I and III IFNs activate the transcription of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (1) that exhibit numerous autocrine and paracrine antiviral roles. Although IFNs are required to clear most viral infections, prolonged expression due to environmental or genetic factors can stimulate sustained immune activation, driving tissue damage, and fibrosis (2, 3).",

Furthermore, these effects appear to be independent of IFN-\u03bb4 activity, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb3 may be a primary mediator of inflammation (5). While the precise mechanisms remain uncertain, peripheral and hepatic immune cell populations vary according to the IFNL polymorphism in patients with chronic HCV infection, suggesting that IFN-\u03bbs can prompt immune cell migration to tissues (5, 6).",

In humans, epithelial cells within the lung, intestine and liver among others, are uniquely IFN-\u03bb sensitive. In particular, IFN-\u03bbs have been shown to protect against pulmonary influenza and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (7, 8), gastrointestinal rotavirus and norovirus (9, 10) and hepatic HBV and HCV (11, 12). While the majority of human studies have been performed in vitro, murine studies have shown potent antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bbs against numerous viruses including influenza and SARS coronavirus (13, 14), rotavirus, norovirus, and reovirus (15\u201317). It should be noted that IFNLR1 expression may differ between humans and mice, as exemplified in murine hepatocytes that do not respond to IFN-\u03bb (18). Immune cells also demonstrate very restricted IFN-\u03bb responsiveness with myeloid immune cell populations harboring the strongest responses: Human dendritic cells (DC) and neutrophils are highly responsive to IFN-\u03bbs (19\u201323), whereas natural killer (NK) and T cells have consistently demonstrated minimal responsiveness (21, 24, 25). Investigation of monocyte and B cell responsiveness has produced conflicting results (21, 24, 26\u201330), perhaps confounded by studies utilizing co-culture models in the presence of IFN-\u03bb responsive cells (31\u201333). As such, isolation of pure immune cell subsets is required to unequivocally define IFN-\u03bb sensitivity.",

DdPCR enables the precise quantification of RNA transcripts by performing the PCR reaction within >10,000 oil droplets, and calculating transcript copies using Poisson's law of small numbers (34). IFNLR1 expression in freshly isolated monocytes and in M\u03d5s cultured for 7 days with GM-CSF was compared to IFN-\u03bb responsive cells (pDCs) and \u201cunresponsive\u201d cells (NK and T cells). Similar to NK and T cells, monocytes expressed minimal IFNLR1 transcript. M\u03d5 and pDC IFNLR1 expression was significantly increased compared to other populations, suggesting IFN-\u03bb responsiveness (Figure 1A). Increased abundance of IFNLR1 was confirmed following monocyte to macrophage differentiation using seven datasets from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (35) (Figure S1). To assess IFNLR1 expression during differentiation, IFNLR1 expression was quantified over 24 h (qPCR, no differentiation stimulus) and 7 days (flow cytometry, GM-CSF differentiation) following monocyte plating. Expression of the IFNLR1 transcript was quickly increased as early as 16 h post-plating, reaching a 30-fold increase at 24 h (Figure 1B). IFNLR1 surface expression was significantly increased at day 3 (monocyte IFNLR1 MFI 927 vs. day 3 M\u03d5 3199) and further increased at day 7 (day 7 M\u03d5 IFNLR1 MFI 10,412) (Figure 1C).",

To avoid generating M\u03d5s whose IFN-\u03bb sensitivity is influenced by phenotype skewing, monocytes were differentiated for 7 days with GM-CSF or M-CSF alone, as previously described (37, 38). The resulting M\u03d5 populations are differentially responsive to inflammatory stimuli, and are thus M1- or M2-shifted while maintaining some baseline characteristics of polarized M\u03d5s (Figure S3).When compared to monocyte derived DCs (MDDCs) generated using IL-4 and GM-CSF, the resulting M\u03d5s express elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, reduced CD1C, and unlike MDDCs, adhere strongly to culture dishes (Figure S4).

A significant increase in NK cell degranulation (CD107a), particularly within the CD56dim population, was observed following co-culture with IFN-\u03bb3 treated GM-M\u03d5s (Figure 4D).

Tissue resident M\u03d5s that demonstrate an M2 phenotype are highly phagocytic and efficient at presenting antigen (40), a phenotype that can be replicated in vitro (41, 42). UV induced apoptotic K562 cells stained with Zombie Yellow viability stain or DAPI labeled E. coli were incubated with M\u03d5s for 1 h at a ratio of 2:1 and 4:1, respectively. The ratio of double-fluorescent (phagocytic, CD14+) cells to mono-fluorescent (non-phagocytic, CD14+) cells, as measured by flow cytometry (Figure 5A) was calculated to determine the phagocytic M\u03d5 percentage (Figure 5B). Confocal microscopy was additionally used to confirm cell engulfment. IFN-\u03bb3 increased phagocytosis of K562 cells (30% increase) and E. coli bacteria (10% increase) in M-M\u03d5 alone. M\u03d5 MFI, indicating of the number of engulfed target cells, was consistent among populations when K562 cells were used as targets, likely reflecting their large size in comparison to M\u03d5s. Conversely, M-M\u03d5 DAPI MFI, representing bacterial engulfment, was significantly higher than M-M\u03d5s, representing an increase in the number of phagocytosed bacteria. To determine the mechanism by which IFN-\u03bb3 stimulates apoptosis, RNA-Seq data was queried, with a focus on M\u03d5 receptors responsible for pathogen and apoptotic cell recognition. Consistent with an M2 phenotype, M-M\u03d5s possessed higher expression of PRRs (TLR2, TLR4, and CD163), apoptotic ligand receptors (CD36 and MERTK) and complement transcripts (C1Q and C2) (Figure S10A). IFN-\u03bb3 had minimal effect on the expression of most phagocytic receptors, but significantly increased key members of the complement cascade (C1S and C1R) (Figure S10B). These data suggest that activation of the complement system by IFN-\u03bb3 may stimulate M-M\u03d5s phagocytosis of both bacterial and apoptotic cells (43, 44), however further functional analysis is required.",

Following incubation, Huh-7 cells were labeled with Epcam, Annexin V, and propidium iodide (PI) to quantify cells undergoing apoptosis (Figure 5C). Additionally, Huh-7 and JFH1 infected Huh-7 cultures were used as controls to confirm HCV mediated Huh-7 cell apoptosis, as previously described (45). M- and GM-M\u03d5s differentiated with IFN-\u03bb3 stimulated an increase of early apoptotic (Annexin V+, PI\u2212) cells, by ~20 and 90%, respectively, compared to mock treated controls (Figure 5D). GM-M\u03d5s alone increased Annexin V+, PI+ cells, representing late apoptosis by ~20% following IFN-\u03bb3 treatment. The cytotoxic mechanism by which M\u03d5s killed infected cells has not been determined, but is likely mediated by soluble factors such as TRAIL that is highly inducible following IFN-\u03bb3 treatment in GM-M\u03d5s in particular (Figure 5E). Low expression of TRAIL in untreated M\u03d5s may explain the apparent lack of apoptosis following co-culture. In addition, no nitric oxide production by M- or GM-M\u03d5s was found in response to IFN-\u03bb3, bacterial or infected cell stimulus. To validate Huh-7 cell apoptosis results, qPCR for apoptosis markers Caspase 3 (Casp3), Caspase 7 (Casp7), and Bax were performed (Figure S11). Co-culture with IFN-\u03bb3 differentiated GM-M\u03d5s increased Casp3 and 7 expression by ~6-fold in addition to increasing the antiviral response of Huh-7 cells as demonstrated by strong induction of ISGs viperin and ISG15.",

Increased expression of pattern recognition receptors [TLR3, IFIH1 [MDA5], DDX58 [RIG-I]] in response to IFN-\u03bb can increase antigen recognition, as we have shown in Figure 5. Numerous pro-inflammatory transcription factors including STATs 1\u20133, IRFs 1, 7, and 9, AP-1, and NF\u03baB components were activated in response to IFN-\u03bb, as demonstrated by an enrichment of their respective target genes (Table S4). Inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL1B that are known mediators of hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury were moderately, albeit significantly induced by IFN-\u03bb treatment alone (Figure 3E), though our data supports additional inflammatory effects of IFN-\u03bb. By strengthening M\u03d5 recognition and response to pathogen associated molecular patterns, IFN-\u03bbs likely sensitize M\u03d5s to inflammatory stimuli, thus amplifying the strength and/or duration of the inflammatory cascade. This has been demonstrated by Liu et al. who showed that IFN-\u03bb1 can promote IL-12 production in TLR7 stimulated M\u03d5s (28).",

In agreement with RNA-Seq gene expression data, we demonstrated that IFN-\u03bb3 treated GM-M\u03d5s stimulate T and NK cell chemotaxis and subsequent NK cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that IFN-\u03bbs are strong mediators of the Th1 response and provides a rationale for works by Morrow et al. who showed that IFN-\u03bb3 can increase IFN-\u03b3 secretion and degranulation despite T cell insensitivity to IFN-\u03bb (58). A similar phenotype has been observed in tumor model NK cells, where IFN-\u03bb signaling drives NK cell cytotoxicity, suppression of tumor growth and metastases (33, 59). This Th1 skewing effect has been further validated using murine models of Th2 diseases where IFN-\u03bb alleviated symptoms of airway disease (60), intestinal inflammation (61), and conjunctivitis (62).",

These data suggest that while type I and type III IFNs induce a similar gene signature, their respective response is dependent not only on the cell type, but also, the inflammatory phenotype of the responsive cell. This data is consistent with work by Fleetwood et al. that demonstrate a strong dependence on type I IFN signaling in M-CSF over GM-CSF cultured M\u03d5s (37). Consistent with an M2 phenotype (63), M-M\u03d5s were not particularly efficient at driving immune cell chemotaxis and activation upon IFN-\u03bb3 stimulation, but were significantly more phagocytic than GM-M\u03d5s both at baseline and in response to IFN-\u03bb3.

Because IFN-\u03bb signaling is longer lasting and unlike IFN-\u03b1 does not become refractory following chronic exposure (64), continuous IFN-\u03bb expression from chronic infections can drive prolonged immune activation. While DCs have a strong IFN-\u03bb response, they are a small population in the liver and migrate toward proximal lymph nodes in response to infection (65). Liver M\u03d5s (Kupffer cells) on the other hand consist of the ~3/4 of hepatic immune cells, and remain locally to become crucial drivers of localized tissue inflammation (65). Neutrophils are the only other immune cell subset with a defined IFN-\u03bb response, and respond with reduced migration and suppression of inflammation (22, 23, 66).",
