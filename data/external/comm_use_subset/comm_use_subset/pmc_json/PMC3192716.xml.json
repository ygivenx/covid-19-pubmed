            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is the end point of a disease process that results in progressive collapse of the femoral head followed by destruction of the hip joint. It has been recognized as a side effect of the corticosteroid used to treat diseases such as Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) [1-3]. High-dose corticosteroid administration is considered to be the most common risk factor for osteonecrosis [4,5]. With the progression of osteonecrosis, both bone and cartilage tissue are deformed, which ultimately leads to collapse of the load-bearing area of the femoral head. Once osteonecrosis collapses the femoral head, most patients require surgical treatment. Several surgical treatments have been established to prevent collapse, such as core decompression [6], osteotomy [7], vascularized or nonvascularized bone grafting [8] and joint arthroplasty [9]. Most of them have certain effects in selected series, but the costs and complications of surgery cannot be ignored. Therefore, preventing osteonecrosis would be an ideal strategy for the treatment of this disease, but there is no established prophylactic measure.",

            "text": "It is well documented that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) are useful for enhancing bone repair in nonunion fractures and related bone-healing problems [10]. In addition, it was used successfully for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, especially at the early stage [11,12], but relatively little is known about its effects on preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Furthermore, the mechanisms of PEMF stimulation for the prevention of steroid-induced osteonecrosis remained unclear, and the optimal protocol for PEMF should be explored [13]. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), involved in bone remodeling, is a multifunctional cytokine. It plays an important role in controlling osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in vivo [14]. Some studies demonstrate that mechanical interruption by lipid emboli in the nutrient vessels can lead to vascular occlusion, and hyperlipidemia has been linked to the development of osteonecrosis [15,16]. We proposed that PEMF may be beneficial in preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head, and the underlying mechanisms involve decreased serum lipid levels and increased the expression of TGF-\u03b21. As a preventive therapy, PEMF could be used in combination with corticosteroid for treatment of many clinical conditions, such as AIDS and SLE, which require high-dose corticosteroid treatment.",

The coils, equal to the width of the cage, were separately placed at a distance of 25 cm. The coils were connected to a signal generator that delivered repetitive, single, square-wave pulses with pulse duration of 4.5 ms and frequency of 15 Hz. The waveform of the PEMF is presented in Figure 1. The frequency of the PEMF was 15 Hz [13]. During each pulse, the magnetic field increased from 0 to 12 G in 4.5 ms and then decreased back to 0 in 20 ms. The rats in the PEMF group were exposed to active pulsed electromagnetic fields 4 h each day. The other rats were housed in identical cages, but with no stimulation.",

All sections were assessed blindly by two independent authors (SD, HP), and the diagnosis of osteonecrosis was established based on the presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the bone trabeculae, accompanied by surrounding bone marrow cell necrosis [18].

However, there are some differences in the osteonecrosis observed in rats as compared to humans. For example, osteonecrosis often leads to femoral head collapse in humans but not in rats, as the epiphyseal line of the femur is permanent in adult rats but not in adult humans. In addition, the metabolic rates are higher in rats than in humans, so osteonecrosis can be observed in rats within one week after steroid treatment [19]. In the present study, the incidence of osteonecrosis (in the MPSL group) was 75%, and no rats died during the experimental period, indicating that this rat model is safe and effective.

In this study, the choice of PEMF parameters was based on a report by Ishida et al. [13], in which they found that PEMF could reduce the risk of steroid-induced osteonecrosis.

Our study showed similar prevention effects, and no rat suffered tissue damage due to the PEMF treatment. Therefore, PEMF stimulation is a safe and effective treatment for preventing osteonecrosis. We also found that the incidence of osteonecrosis in the MPSL group displayed a progression, while that in the PEMF group did not. In the MPSL group, the incidence of osteonecrosis increased to a peak at 4 weeks after the last MPSL injection and then declined at 8 weeks. It is interesting that the serum lipid levels in the MPSL group showed a similar trend, increasing to a peak at 2 weeks after the last MPSL injection and declining at 4 weeks.

In addition, lipid-lowering agents were used to prevent osteonecrosis and revealed satisfactory results [21,22]. The data indicated that hyperlipidemia may be one of the pathological mechanisms of steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Therefore, the prevention of hyperlipidemia might also prevent steroid-induced osteonecrosis. We consider that PEMF could prevent osteonecrosis because several studies have shown that it can decrease serum lipid levels [12,23]. Ishida et al. [13] also found that PEMF did not affect bone marrow fat cell size and hypothesized that its preventative effect on steroid-induced osteonecrosis occurs via a mechanism independent of lipid metabolism. Therefore, in the present study, we measured only serum markers of adipogenesis, including TG, TC, LDL and HDL, in order to explain the underlying mechanism of PEMF stimulation in preventing steroid-induced osteonecrosis. Assays of TG, TC and LDL/HDL in the MPSL group showed a significant increase compared with the PEMF and PS groups at all time points. In contrast, the serum lipid levels were similar between the PEMF group and the PS group. Thus, we speculated that PEMF stimulation may prevent osteonecrosis by decreasing serum lipid levels. The underlying mechanism of PEMF in the living organism remains unclear. Some theories have been proposed: that the electromagnetic fields have the potential to regulate flow through cation channels, changing the steady-state concentrations of cellular cations and thus the metabolic processes dependent on cation concentrations. We therefore hypothesize that the biological effects of PEMF on serum lipids were associated with ion-channel gating on the cell membrane [24,25].",
