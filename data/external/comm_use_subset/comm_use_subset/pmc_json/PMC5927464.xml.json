            "text": "Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV or Theiler\u2019s virus) belongs to the genus Cardiovirus in the family Picornaviridae. Persistent strains of TMEV, such as DA, BeAn or TO4 have a remarkable ability to establish persistent infections of the mouse central nervous system. In susceptible mouse strains, TMEV can persist lifelong, replicating mainly in oligodendrocytes, macrophages and microglial cells, in the white matter of the spinal cord [1\u20135]. Two accessory proteins, L and L*, were shown to contribute to the ability of TMEV to establish persistent infections by interfering with the host innate immune response [2, 5]. The L* (read \u201cL-star\u201d) protein is an 18kDa protein encoded by an alternative open reading frame overlapping the L-, VP4- and VP2-coding regions of the ORF encoding the viral polyprotein [6]. It facilitates the infection of macrophages in vitro [7, 8] and the initiation of persistent infections in vivo [9, 10]. L* is first detected in the cytosol of infected cells and subsequently accumulates in the mitochondrial outer membrane [11]. We previously showed that L* can inhibit RNase L through direct protein-protein interaction [12]. Interestingly, RNase L inhibition by L* is a highly species-specific process. Indeed, L* of the mouse TMEV strain DA inhibits mouse RNase L but not its orthologues from other tested species including rat [12], whereas L* of the rat TMEV strain RTV-1 inhibits rat but not human or even mouse RNase L [13].",

Interferon secreted in response to viral infection induces the expression of a family of enzymes: the oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS). OAS are produced as inactive enzymes and become activated upon binding dsRNA, a byproduct of viral replication. Active OAS catalyze the conversion of ATP into 2\u2019-5\u2019 oligoadenylates called 2-5A [16\u201319]. 2-5A then act as second messengers and bind to monomeric inactive RNase L, triggering its dimerization and its activation [20]. Enzymatically active RNase L cleaves viral and cellular single-stranded RNA and therefore inhibits protein synthesis, decreases viral replication, and ultimately leads to apoptosis [19, 21, 22]. Through the generation of short RNA fragments, RNase L can further amplify IFN signaling [23]. RNase L products were also reported to trigger autophagy and to activate the inflammasome [24\u201326].",

In the active, dimeric RNase L, two 2-5A molecules are embedded in a composite pocket formed by ANK R2 and ANK R4 of one protomer, and ANK R9 and the pseudokinase N-terminal lobe of the other protomer [27\u201330].

As a consequence, viruses have evolved several strategies to escape this pathway. Interestingly, almost any step of the OAS/RNase L pathway can be targeted by viruses (for review: [34, 35]). For instance, Influenza A virus encodes the NS1 protein that sequesters dsRNA, thereby preventing OAS activation [36]. More recently, it was shown that MHV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and rotaviruses express the phosphodiesterases, ns2, NS4b, and VP3 respectively, which degrade 2-5A and thus prevent RNase L activation [33, 37, 38]. Poliovirus acts downstream of the pathway through a highly structured genomic RNA region, which acts as a cleavage-resistant substrate for RNase L [39, 40]. As mentioned above, we recently observed that TMEV L* directly binds RNase L suggesting a novel mechanism of RNase L inhibition [12]. As L* was found to bind the N-terminal part of RNase L (residues 1\u2013400) encompassing the entire ankyrin domain (ANK R1-R9), L* most likely acts by inhibiting 2-5A binding to RNase L, or by preventing RNase L dimerization. It is however not excluded that L* could act in an allosteric fashion to block the catalytic activity of RNase L.",

The ANK-eGFP fusion proteins were N-terminally Flag-tagged. We next tested whether ANK-eGFP fusion co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged L* (HA-L*), in extracts of transfected 293T cells. As summarized in Fig 1A, L*DA interacted with fusion proteins carrying mouse RNase L ANK R1-R2 but not with fusions carrying ANK R2 or ANK R1 alone (Fig 1B). Specificity of the interaction was confirmed by showing that L*DA only interacted with mouse ANK R1-R2 constructs while L*RTV-1 only interacted with rat ANK R1-R2 (Fig 1C).

Mouse and human RNase L share 64% amino-acid sequence identity, divergent residues being spread throughout the protein (Fig 2). We thus tested the ability of L* from the mouse virus strain DA to bind and inhibit a series of chimeras constructed between mouse and human RNase L (Fig 2A\u20132D). Binding was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation of N-terminally Flag-tagged RNase L chimeras (Flag-RNase L) with HA-tagged L* (HA-L*)(Fig 2A\u20132C). As expected, L* interacted with mouse but not with human RNase L (Fig 2B lane 1, 6). Interestingly, swapping either the first RNase L ANK repeat (residues 1\u201358) or even residues 26 to 51 within this repeat (Fig 2B, lanes 2 and 7) led to a complete swap of L* binding abilities. Within this segment, several amino acid stretches diverge between human and mouse RNase L (Fig 2E). Exchanging residues 26\u201328 did not lead to L* binding to human RNase L (Fig 2B, lane 8). Exchanging residues 47\u201351 led to recognition of both human and mouse RNase L by L* (Fig 2B, lanes 4 and 9). Exchanging both residue stretches led to a significant swap in L* binding abilities as L* readily bound human RNase L (Fig 2B, lane 10) and almost completely lost the ability to bind mouse RNase L (Fig 2B, lane 5) (Fig 2C). Thus, amino acid stretches D26, S27, S28 and K47, D50, A51 within ANK R1 of mouse RNase L are important for L* binding.",

The OAS/RNase L pathway was activated in these cells by transfecting polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C). RNA was then extracted and separated on agarose gel and on RNA chips (Fig 2D and S2A Fig) to evaluate RNA degradation (i.e. RNase L activity). Again, mouse RNase L was inhibited by L* whereas human RNase L was not (Fig 2D and S2A Fig, lanes 2 and 12), and swapping residues 26\u201351 of ANK R1 resulted in inhibition of human but not mouse RNase L by L* (lanes 4 and 14). Swapping residues 26\u201328 and 47\u201351 led to a clear inhibition of human RNase L while decreasing L* influence on mouse RNase L activity (lanes 10 and 20).",

Swapping ANK R1-R2 (residues 1\u201384) was sufficient to swap both interaction and inhibition phenotypes (Fig 3B and 3C, lanes 3, 4, 9, 10; Figs 3D and S2B, lanes 5, 6, 14, 15). In contrast to what was observed with human/mouse chimeras, swapping ANK R1 (residues 18\u201358) alone was not sufficient to exchange the phenotypes, indicating that residues in ANK R2 were also required for L* interaction. Insertion of point mutations based on differences between rat and mouse sequences showed that swapping residues 80\u201381 in ANK R2 was sufficient to trigger rat RNase L recognition by L*DA (Fig 3B, compare lanes 7 and 11; Fig 3D, compare lanes 11 and 17) and mouse RNase L recognition by L*RTV-1 (Fig 3B, compare lanes 2 and 6; Fig 3D, compare lanes 3 and 9). Although the exchange of phenotype was not complete (i.e. some interaction was still detected between L*DA and mouse RNase LR80,Y81), these data show that residues 80 and 81 of ANK R2 contribute to L* binding to RNase L and L*-mediated RNase L inhibition.",

We thus introduced point mutations in Flag-mouse RNase L constructs, that were shown to inhibit 2-5A binding in the case of human RNase L. This included mutations W60A and K89A of ANK R2 as well as mutations in ANK R4 and ANK R9 that were analyzed as controls. As shown in Fig 5A and 5B, none of the tested mutation significantly affected HA-L* binding to RNase L, suggesting that L* binds close to but not at the sites of 2-5A binding. Functional tests were performed as above to assess the capacity of mutant RNase L to degrade RNA (Fig 5C and 5D). Surprisingly, RNase L activity was not affected by mutation R309A and only partly affected by mutations E131A, H311A or R155A, suggesting that residues involved in 2-5A binding partly vary between mouse and human RNase L.",

Our data suggest the latter explanation. Indeed, as shown in Fig 7A (white arrows), high doses of 2-5A added to lysates of 293T cells overexpressing L* and Flag-mouse RNase L could overcome L*-mediated inhibition of RNase L activity. To analyze the influence of L* on 2-5A binding to RNase L in a more direct manner, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed with purified recombinant L*, mouse RNase L and, as a negative control, human RNase L. First, by immobilizing biotin-modified 2-5A on streptavidin (SA)-chips followed by addition of mouse RNase L, we determined that mouse RNase L rapidly binds to 2-5A (ka = 2.1 x 105 M-1 x sec-1) with a relatively slow dissociation rate of 2.2 x10-3 sec-1 (Fig 7). Direct binding of mouse RNase L or human RNase L to (His)6-L* immobilized on Ni-NTA sensor chip was then assessed. Consistent with our prior observations (12), we found that human RNase L did not bind to L* while mouse RNase L bound to L* with a KD of 1.3 x 10\u22126 M (S3A and S3B Fig, Fig 7E). Similarly, L* bound to immobilized mouse GST-RNase L (S3C Fig, Fig 7E). Next, to determine if L* binding interfered with 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L, biotin-labeled 2-5A was immobilized on SA-chips and mouse RNase L or human RNase L was simultaneously injected without or with increasing concentrations of L* and sensograms were recorded. Whereas L* efficiently inhibited binding of mouse RNase L to 2-5A (IC50 = 6.0 x 10-7M), L* did not inhibit human RNase L from binding with 2-5A (Fig 7B and 7C, respectively). Additionally, L* was immobilized and mouse RNase L was injected in the absence or presence of different concentrations of 2-5A. 2-5A dose-dependently inhibited mouse RNase L binding to L* (IC50 = 1.32 x 10\u22128 M) (Fig 7D). Taken together, our data show that L* interferes with 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L while no effect of L* was observed on 2-5A binding to human RNase L.",

Results confirmed that L* inhibits 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation and showed that while the 2-5A concentration for half activation (K50) remained unchanged, the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the RNase L enzymatic activity was decreased by ~40% by L* (Fig 7F). Next, mouse RNase L was either pre-incubated with increasing L* concentrations followed by addition of 3 nM 2-5A (Fig 7G, circles) or pre-incubated with 3 nM 2-5A followed by addition of increasing L* concentrations (Fig 7G, triangles). In both cases L* inhibited 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation but efficacy of the inhibition was more potent when L* was added prior to 2-5A (IC50: 9.99 \u03bcM vs 34.14 \u03bcM). Altogether, these results suggest that L* inhibits 2-5A binding to mouse RNase L, possibly because L* inhibits dimerization required for cooperative binding of 2-5A between the RNase L protomers [30, 45].",

We thus tested the RNase L antagonist capacity of L* in chimeric MHV viruses. We constructed recombinant MHV A59 viruses (Fig 8A) carrying either a wild-type or a catalytically defective (H126R mutation) ns2 PDE (an enzyme that degrades 2-5A). From the latter construct, we obtained chimeric viruses where the non-essential NS4 protein was replaced by either wild-type L* (ns2H126R-L*) or a truncated L*1\u201392 lacking anti-RNase L activity (ns2H126R-L*1\u201392) [12].",

On the one hand, replacing two amino acids stretches (26\u201328 and 47\u201351) of human RNase L by the corresponding mouse RNase L residues was sufficient to trigger interaction with L* and efficient L*-mediated inhibition of human RNase L. On the other hand, rat/mouse RNase L chimeras showed that residues 80, 81 in ANK R2 were also critical for L* interaction with RNase L and, to a lesser extent, for RNase L inhibition. In general, results from interaction and functional studies were congruent. For some constructs, however, interaction was observed while inhibition was weak, suggesting that a strong affinity is required for RNase L inhibition. In summary, our data show that L* inhibits RNase L activation by associating with loops exposed at the surface of RNase L ANK R1 and R2 (Fig 4).

Data confirmed that L* counteracted RNase L activation by 2-5A but the Vmax of the RNase L enzymatic activity was significantly decreased while the 2-5A concentration for half activation (K50: ~2nM) was preserved (Fig 7F). Also, L* inhibited 2-5A-dependent RNase L activation when it was added both prior or after 2-5A addition but the inhibition was stronger when L* was added first (Fig 7G). Taken together, our data are compatible with a model where L* binding to RNase L sterically hinders 2-5A binding to ANK repeats of RNase L. However, pre-bound 2-5A would decrease the affinity of L* for RNase L, likely through dimerization of RNase L. If our model is correct, RNase L activation/inhibition would depend on a race between 2-5A and L* production in infected cells. It is worth noting that L* is produced by an open reading frame (ORF) that overlaps the ORF coding the main viral polyprotein. The L* ORF can be translated from the viral genomic RNA in an IRES-dependent fashion, and is likely expressed very early after infection, before viral dsRNA produced during RNA replication can trigger OAS activation.",

The NS1 protein of influenza A virus sequesters dsRNA thus preventing sensing by OAS [36]. DsRNA sequestration allows the virus to use a single activity to interfere with OAS activation and to prevent activation of other dsRNA-dependent pathways such as the RIG-like helicase pathway that leads to IFN production and that of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) [51], which leads to translation inhibition. Conversely, acting downstream of the OAS/RNase L pathway would represent a more specific manner to efficiently antagonize RNase L. It is expected that such a strategy would be used by viruses that are particularly susceptible to the OAS/RNase L pathway. In this respect, it is puzzling that L* evolved to bind RNase L, and yet interferes with 2-5A binding rather than preventing RNase L dimerization directly. Indeed, the unique known function of 2-5A is RNase L activation [52]. Thus, inhibiting dimerization would appear as a more likely mechanism to antagonize RNase L activation because the concentration of RNase L monomers is expected to be much lower than that of 2-5A molecules, which can reach micromolar concentrations in infected cells [53, 54].",

A hypothesis is that complete RNase L inhibition would be detrimental for these viruses so that they evolved in a way to inhibit RNase L in a regulated manner, according to the concentration of the antagonist protein. For instance, products generated by RNase L enzymatic activity can promote autophagy. Induction of autophagy by RNase L was reported to dampen EMCV or SeV replication at early stages of infection whereas it promoted viral replication at later stages [24, 25], possibly by increasing the supply in autophagosomal membranes that are hijacked by some viruses like EMCV [55] to assemble their replication complexes.",

After 10 min at 37\u00b0C, crosslinking of interacting proteins was performed by addition of 5mM disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, ThermoScientific, 21658) for 30 min. Finally the crosslinking reaction was quenched with 50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, RNA was extracted from 1/6th volume of the lysate as a control for RNase L activation and protein samples were prepared by addition of Laemmli buffer to the remaining lysate. RNase L activation was controlled by rRNA degradation analysis on RNA gel electrophoresis and RNase L dimerization was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich M8823).",
