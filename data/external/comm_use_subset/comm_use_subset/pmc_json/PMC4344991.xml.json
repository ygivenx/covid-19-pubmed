Nucleic acid based tests for respiratory viruses are currently used as a rapid and sensitive diagnostic approach for clinical specimens. A cost-effective, accurate and rapid multiplex assay is highly desirable in clinical virology laboratories for testing and diagnosing common and emerging viruses. Even though the multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of respiratory viruses, such assays are limited to a maximum of four multiplexed targets, and the high cost of reagents and equipment involved is particularly limiting for laboratories with low financial constraints [2].",

            "text": "Therefore, a novel dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) technology was developed to solve these problems. The DPO primer contains two separate priming regions joined by a polydeoxyinosine linker, which assumes a bubble-like structure not involved in priming, but which delineates the boundary between two regions of the primer [3]. This structure confers distinct annealing properties on the two primer segments. The longer 5\u2032-segment initiates stable priming, while the short 3\u2032-segment determines target-specific extension [3]. The advantage of DPO based PCR is the blocking extension of non-specifically primed templates under less than optimal PCR conditions [3]. DPO technology was commercialized and used in many recent studies to test different respiratory viruses [3]. Additionally, several studies have compared DPO based multiplex PCR with other rapid methods for the detection of influenza viruses. The results suggested that the DPO based multiplex PCR system had a higher sensitivity and specificity than the other methods tested [4-7]. However, most of these recent studies, including those using commercial DPO based rapid detection kits, tested numerous different respiratory viruses or different types of influenza viruses. Only one commercial kit (Seeplex\u00ae Influenza A/B OneStep Typing, Seegene, Seoul, Korea) can simultaneously detect influenza A, B and subtypes of influenza A including 2009 pandemic H1 and Human Seasonal Influenza A (H1 and H3). Recently, the live poultry market has posed a high risk for human infection following the avian infection in Beijing, China [8]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was identified in local poultry and wild birds is enzootic in China [8]. Therefore, it is important to develop a rapid and simple method to detect avian influenza viruses. To our knowledge, no previous study has reported the development of a DPO multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of influenza A, B and subtypes of influenza A including H5N1.",

            "text": "Several previous studies have evaluated different respiratory virus diagnostic tests using the DPO-based commercial kit including Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE Detection kit and RV 12 Detection kit (Seegene). Their results indicated that the sensitivity and specificity of the Seeplex DPO based PCR system were 83.3% and 95.2%, respectively [12]. Cho et al. showed that the sensitivity and specificity of Seeplex RV15 DPO PCR for influenza A were 93% and 99.9%, respectively, and for influenza B were 80% and 99.9%, respectively [13]. Previous studies only used nasopharyngeal swabs or nasal washs, but not oropharyngeal swabs, as their main clinical sample types. The variation in sensitivity and specificity of influenza virus detection between this study and previous studies might be due to different patient sampling sites, which might result in different virus loads between the two sample panels. Commonly used clinical specimens for the detection of respiratory viruses are oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washees and sputum. However, different sampling methods may give rise to a change in the detection of influenza virus sensitivity. Li et al. indicated that nasopharyngeal swab samples may be the most effective alternative to nasal washes and oropharyngeal swab samples for the examination of respiratory viruses in adults [14,15]. Another study also suggested that the use of nasopharyngeal swabs was superior to oropharyngeal swabs for the detection of influenza viruses by PCR [16]. Indeed, the determination of the correct sampling site for collection of clinical specimens might be the most important factor affecting the successful detection of influenza viruses.",

Although the use of conventional primer has a low cost and requires less technical training for lab technicians, this approach often produces false positive results with low sensitivity and specificity. The use of conventional primers has a number of disadvantages including primer competition, primer dimers and varing anealing temperatures required for different primers. The current use of multiplex conventional PCR requires further validation including nested PCR or probe hybridization assay to verify the results [17].",

From the comparative study of positive specimens detected by qPCR and multiplex DPO PCR in this study, 89.3% of influenza A positive specimens were observed at a higher Cq range (30 < Cq < 35). The analytic results from influenza B testing indicated that 96.5% samples were in the Cq range from 30 to 35 (Figure 10). The high percentage of qPCR positive specimens not detected by multiplex DPO PCR might have had a low target concentration or were degraded by re-freezing of the sample [4].",
