            "text": "The first porcine circovirus (PCV) was discovered in a pig kidney cell line (PK15 ATCC-CCL33) and was called porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV-1) [1]. Experimental infections have shown that PCV-1 is non-pathogenic for pigs [2]. In the 1990s, a new disease called post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) emerged in Europe and North America. PMWS-affected animals exhibit growth retardation, pallor and dyspnea. At necropsy, lymph nodes are enlarged and the main histological lesions are lymphocyte depletion with histiocytic inflammatory infiltration of lymphoid tissues [3]. A new circovirus was identified from diseased pigs and was named porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) [4]. Now PCV-2 is recognized as the etiological agent of PMWS and is associated with several diseases designated by the abbreviation PCVD (porcine circovirus-associated diseases) [3]. To diagnose typical PMWS, specific clinical signs and lesions have to be observed together with the detection of PCV-2 antigen or nucleic acid in the lesions [5]. Pigs infected experimentally often developed sub-clinical infection and typical PMWS is hard to reproduce. Most experimental models used PCV-2 infection combined with co-factors such as bacteria, virus or immunostimulation to increase the severity of the clinical signs and the incidence of PMWS [3]. Hence, to qualify the PCV-2 virulence, the virulence definition described by Casadevall et al. can be used [6]. The virulence definition considered lesions and symptoms but also which mechanism or step of viral life cycle is implicated in the expression of virulence as ability to infect the host or ability to replicate.",

Their genome is a circular, single-stranded DNA molecule of 1767 or 1768 bases encoding three major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 codes for the Rep and Rep' proteins implicated in the replication of the PCV-2 DNA [7]. ORF2 codes for the capsid protein (Cap) which is the only structural protein [8] and ORF3 for a protein possibly involved in apoptosis mechanism [9]. Molecular epidemiology studies allowed separating PCV-2 isolates into two main genogroups: PCV-2a and PCV-2b [10,11]. PCV-2 isolates from each of the two major genogroups had a motif, located between amino acids 86 to 91, strongly specific and conserved in their capsid proteins [10]. In 2005, a PCVD outbreak occurred in North America. This event was concomitant with the emergence of isolates of PCV-2b genogroup [12], which happened also in some European countries including Switzerland [13] and in Spain [14]. PCV-2b emergence seemed to be correlated to PMWS outbreak, giving rise to the assumption that the genogroup PCV-2b was more virulent than the PCV-2a one. Nevertheless, no link was clearly established between the genogroup and virulence of isolates, because same isolates were detected in PMWS-affected and non-affected herds in France [15].",

The capsid protein is the most variable protein in the PCV-2 (91 to 100% of identity in nucleic acids versus 98 to 100% for the Rep). It is the main antigenic determinant of PCV-2 and contains four linear B-cell epitopes.

Both fragments were cloned separately in pCR4 vector with the TOPO TA kit (Invitrogen) and transformed in XL1 Blue MRF' electro-competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, the two plasmids were digested by NdeI and NotI enzymes (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The rep gene enclosed between the NdeI and NotI sites was ligated in the plasmid containing the PCV-2a genome and digested by the same enzymes. The ligation mix was subsequently transformed in XL1 Blue MRF' electro-competent cells.",

Differences between the two isolates were noted on pigs inoculated at the age of eight months without immunostimulation. Moreover, PMWS was reproduced in SPF piglets with the same PCV-2b isolate using the virus without immunostimulation [29]. We also previously demonstrated that a PCV-2b infectious clone (the same isolate as in this study) was infectious in vivo and was able to trigger clinical PMWS in an SPF piglet when PCV-2b clone transfection and immunostimulation were combined [21]. In this previous work, the PCV-2b genomic load found in the lymphoid tissues of the PMWS-affected piglet reached an average of 1014 genome copies/g of tissue at 32 dpt. In our present study, the maximum genomic load in organs was 1010.6 genome copies/g of tissue at 35 dpt in a pig inoculated with the PCV-2b clone which is below the PMWS diagnosis threshold of 1011 genome copies/g of tissue proposed by Blanchard et al. [24]. The differences found between these two studies could be explained by the quantity of DNA injected in pigs. In contrast, the PCV-2a infectious clone was not previously tested for virulence itself, although the virus failed to induce PMWS in piglets, while it was recovered from a diseased piglet [20]. Thus the two parental clones PCV-2a and PCV-2b showed differences in experimental conditions similar to the infectious virus. On the other hand, difference in virulence could also be observed between isolates of the same PCV-2a genogroup [30]. Indeed, two PCV-2a isolates (Genbank accession numbers DQ397521 and AF264042) exhibited differences in microlesions, in genomic viral loads in sera and in seroconversion. The conclusion stated that the AF264042 strain was more virulent than the other one even if the AF264042 PCV-2a induced sub-clinical infections [30,31]. These two strains presented nine amino acids difference in their Cap proteins and two in their Rep proteins. A study has also demonstrated that only two amino acid differences in the Cap protein at positions 110 and 191 led to difference in PCV-2 virulence in vivo [32]. In our study, the Cap proteins of PCV-2a and PCV-2b had twenty amino acid differences (Figure 4) and the Rep proteins one amino acid (at position 32). The two parental Cap proteins differed by their motif specific of the genogroup but also in amino acids 59, 75, 131, 206 and 232 that were amino acid changes between the two PCV-2a DQ397521 and AF264042 that previously showed differences in virulence [31]. Here the two parental clone Cap also displayed a change in amino acid 191 that was one of the amino acid found responsible for virulence attenuation [32]. Thus there were several differences that could be involved in the different characteristics of PCV-2a and PCV-2b.",

The two mutant clones induced sub-clinical infection. Some of the parameters examined to define PCV-2 virulence mechanism (genomic loads in serum and in organs) were weakened in piglets inoculated with the PCV-2b/motif 2a mutant in comparison to those inoculated with the PCV-2b clone. This mutant clone was infectious in vivo and allowed the development of a PCV-2 immunogenic response. Similarly, the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant clone presented a decrease in virulence relative to its parent, the PCV-2a clone. However, the introduction of the capsid motif specific to the potentially more virulent PCV-2b genogroup did not confer higher virulence properties to the recipient PCV-2a virus. On the contrary, slight genomic loads and infectious titers in organs were revealed, explaining that no seroconversion, no genome copies in the serum and no viral antigens in the lesions were detected for PCV-2a/motif 2b inoculated group. Macroscopic lesions were also less severe in pigs transfected with this mutant than in those transfected by the PCV-2a parental clone. All these results showed that the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant clone had a virulence attenuated compared to its parent, the PCV-2a clone.",

The genomic loads were lower in the organs of the pigs transfected with the mutant clones than those of the pigs transfected with the parental clones and in the organs of the PCV-2a transfected pigs compared to those transfected with PCV-2b. This demonstrated that the replication efficiency could be different between parental strains and between both parental clones and mutants. One hypothesis to explain this is a differential regulation of the replication step. It was previously showed that the regulation of replication was controlled by the Rep and its own promoter for porcine circovirus [7]. In our study, the Rep and Rep' proteins of the two parental clones had only one amino acid difference. This amino acid was outside of the three motives implicated in the Rep functions [34,35] and hence might not explain a difference in replication. Nevertheless, in some Geminiviruses, the absence or inactivation of the Cap protein led to reduced accumulation of single-stranded DNA associated with an increase in the level of double-stranded DNA replicative forms [36,37]. It has been also reported that the Cap protein of the mung bean yellow mosaic India virus, a geminivirus, might have a role in controlling the viral replication and thus the copy number of viral DNA. Indeed, the interaction of its Cap and Rep proteins inhibited the nicking and closing function of the Rep and not the Rep ATPase activity [38].",

In this case, the PCV-2a Cap protein might lead to the most effective control of replication. For PCV-2b, the Cap protein with less interaction with the Rep could result to enhanced replication and accumulation of double-stranded DNA, like for the Geminiviruses [37]. In the same way, the introduction of the PCV-2a motif in the PCV-2b backbone (PCV-2b/motif 2a clone) induced a decrease of viral DNA in organs compared to the PCV-2b and PCV-2a groups. This suggests that the motif specific of genogroup may be involved in the control of replication. However, on the other hand, the introduction of PCV-2b motif in the PCV-2a backbone (PCV-2a/motif 2b group) led to a decrease of genome copies in organs compared to the PCV-2a but also to a decrease of the produced infectious particles. These latter results showed that the genogroup motif could be involved in the replication regulation but not solely. In this study, the PCV-2a/motif 2b mutant presented an attenuation of virulence compared to its parent the PCV-2a. The swap of the genogroup motif i.e. four amino acids mutated in PCV-2a, might have generated a defective virus. But the opposite with the introduction of 4 mutations in the PCV-2b capsid protein did not cause the same effect. It has been shown for PCV-2a that only two amino acid mutations in the capsid protein induced virulence attenuation [32]. Consequently, we can assume that the capsid protein of PCV-2 does not support a lot of variation. The genogroup motif is an important determinant for characteristics and virulence of isolates. The results of the two mutants of this study demonstrated that the capsid background of this motif is also strongly implicated in these mechanisms.",
