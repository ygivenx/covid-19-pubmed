            "text": "Turnover of mRNA is not only important for regulation of cellular gene expression, it also plays an essential role in antiviral defense, since degradation of viral RNA is employed as part of the protective immune response (1\u20134). Thus, viruses have developed mechanisms to alter cellular RNA metabolism in order to block or subvert stress responses and facilitate viral replication (5, 6). Viruses can alter the distribution and quantity of cellular mRNAs by modifying cellular RNA metabolism functions, as is the case with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), adenovirus (AdV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), poliovirus, and influenza virus (7\u201312). In other cases, viruses directly degrade mRNA via viral ribonucleases that induce cellular host shutoff, such as in alpha- and gammaherpesviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and influenza virus (13\u201317). Two families of viruses have been described that use direct decapping as part of their strategy to inhibit cellular translation and promote viral protein synthesis (18): the Saccharomyces cerevisiae double-stranded L-A virus, which uses a specific mechanism of decapping related to cap snatching (4), and vaccinia virus (VACV), which possesses two viral decapping enzymes (D9 and D10) (19, 20). These viral enzymes, which have approximately 25% sequence similarity, possess a Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-amino-acid sequence (GX5EX5[UA]XREX2EEXGU, where X can be any amino acid and U is a hydrophobic residue). In vitro assays have demonstrated that both recombinant D9 and D10 proteins exhibit decapping activity, which is abrogated in both proteins by single-site mutations of the conserved glutamate residues in the Nudix motif, indicating that it is essential for catalysis (19, 20).",

Consequently, ASFV infection is characterized by a fine-tuned temporal regulation of viral gene expression, which allows transcripts to be classified as immediate early, early, intermediate, or late depending on their distinctive accumulation kinetics and expression in the presence of inhibitors of viral replication, such as cytosine arabinoside (AraC) (25). Interestingly, the virus is able to temporally control the expression of its genes while simultaneously causing strong cellular shutoff (25\u201327). However, ASFV protein synthesis relies on the cellular translation machinery, with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and eIF4G playing a critical role (26).",

The Nudix motif is essential for catalysis, as single-site mutation of the conserved residues E147, E150, and E151 causes a loss of decapping activity. The Malawi strain isoform, g5Rp, is able to interact directly with RNA, and though its activity is strongly inhibited by uncapped RNAs, it is not affected by cap analogs or methylated nucleotides, suggesting that ASFV-DP preferentially recognizes the RNA moiety on the substrate (28). Nevertheless, the in vivo role of the protein is still unknown.",

Therefore, it is a good candidate to be the viral factor involved in degradation of cellular mRNAs and the temporal regulation of viral mRNAs. In this study, the role of ASFV-DP was investigated in cultured cells and during infection. At late stages of infection, ASFV-DP presents subcellular localization typical of the viral factories, where it colocalizes with the mRNA cap structure. Moreover, we show that it is able to interact with components of the ribosomes, such as the RPL23a protein, and with poly(A) RNA in cells stably expressing the protein. We have determined that this interaction is mediated primarily by the ASFV-DP N-terminal region and that conserved amino acids of the Nudix motif are not required for the interaction. This viral protein also interacts with viral and cellular RNAs in the context of infection, and its overexpression in infected cells results in decreased levels of both species of transcripts.",

            "text": "ASFV infection induces a strong cellular shutoff (26, 27), but the molecular mechanism by which this important regulatory step is achieved remains elusive. In order to determine if a defect in translation is involved, we analyzed the polysome profile of uninfected (mock-infected) and ASFV-infected Vero cells. Polysomes are mRNAs interacting with two or more ribosomes, and de novo protein synthesis is reflected in the number and amount of ribosomes found within the polysomal mRNA fraction (30). Mock- and ASFV-infected Vero cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 5 PFU/cell) were lysed at 14 h postinfection (hpi) in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of protein synthesis that blocks elongation, causing ribosome stalling on mRNA (31), followed by resolution of polysomes in a sucrose gradient (30). By 14 hpi, viral protein synthesis is mainly achieved, whereas cells are still alive, allowing the analysis of the effect of viral infection on cell translation machinery events. ASFV infection promoted a reduction in the amount of polysomes (measured as the area under the line of the polysome fraction), but not in the polysome number (measured as the number of peaks found on the polysome fraction) (Fig. 1A), which suggests that ASFV infection triggers a decrease in the amount of mRNAs being translated. To further clarify this result, we next quantified the levels of some representative, unrelated cellular mRNAs by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) during ASFV infection. A significant decrease in all analyzed cellular mRNAs was observed from 14 hpi (Fig. 1B), with similar timing to cellular shutoff.

The ASFV-DP structure was modeled based on the SpDcp2 crystal structure (Fig. 2B), and maximal structural similarity was found in the helix structure of the catalytic Nudix motif, while the N- and C-terminal regions had lower similarities. The terminal regions of the Nudix motif are commonly implicated in regulation of decapping activity and are less conserved (18), in agreement with what is observed in ASFV-DP.",

ASFV-DP was detected in the presence of the drug, indicating that its synthesis does not require viral DNA replication, identifying ASFV-DP as an early viral protein (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3B, ASFV-DP was also detected at later times of the infection, a fact that can be related to the functional role of the protein. As a control, the late protein p72 was not detected in the presence of AraC (Fig. 3B).",

COS-7 cells were transfected with pASFV-DP-HA and subsequently infected with ASFV in order to activate the viral promoter, allowing expression and localization in the context of natural ASFV infection. The progression of viral infection was assessed by the presence of viral factories, which, together with cellular DNA, were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) or To-Pro 3 (Thermo Fisher; T-3205) (blue) (Fig. 3C). We detected that ASFV-DP (green) presented a distribution pattern during the viral cycle similar to that of calnexin (red), a marker of the ER, indicating that ASFV-DP localizes to the organelle (Fig. 3C). Due to the fact that several mRNAs are translated on the surface of the ER (32), ASFV-DP localization on the organelle is compatible with its expected decapping activity, as the viral protein would have easier access to capped mRNAs. Interestingly, ASFV-DP was spread within the cytoplasm but accumulated at the viral factories (mainly at the peripheries of the structures) at late times postinfection, consistent with a possible role in the regulation of viral mRNA stability (Fig. 3C and D). It has been previously reported that viral membrane precursors are derived from the ER cisternae, which are recruited to the viral factory and later modified (33), which could explain the observed presence of both calnexin and ASFV-DP at the peripheries of viral replication sites at late times postinfection (Fig. 3C). To confirm our results, we further studied the ASFV-DP distribution compared to that of the ASFV major capsid protein p72, which localizes to the viral factories (34, 35). At 16 hpi, p72 was found within the viral factories, while ASFV-DP was located mainly in the surroundings of these structures (Fig. 3D).",

Unfused GST was used to discriminate between specific and nonspecific interactions. We observed that under all the conditions tested (mock infection, 6 hpi, and 18 hpi), cytoplasmic ribosome proteins from the small (RPS6, RPS14, and RPS3) and large (RPL23a, RPL24, and RPL8) subunits were enriched in the ASFV-DP fraction (Fig. 4A; see Fig. S1A and Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). In order to validate this result, cosedimentation experiments were performed. Briefly, mock- and ASFV-infected cells were subjected to polysome profile analysis, the different fractions were recovered, and ASFV-DP and RPS6 presence was analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-RPS6 was used to detect the ribosome. As shown in Fig. 4B, ASFV-DP cosedimented with this complex and was mainly detected with the 40S subunit (suggesting a role in the initiation translation complex and mRNA) but was also present in the 60S, 80S, and polysome fractions. Interestingly, immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by Western blotting confirmed that ASFV-DP interacts with the ribosomal protein RPL23a in infected cells (Fig. 4C). This interaction was specific and RNA independent, since (i) no interaction between ASFV-DP and other translation factors, such as PABP, RPS6, or RPL24, appeared to occur in living cells (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material), and (ii) treatment with RNAses A/T1 did not affect the interaction (Fig. 4C, right). It is noteworthy that this is the first time that an interaction between the ribosome and an ASFV protein has been described.",

A specific antibody able to recognize both m7G and m3G structures (red) (36) was used, the nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and viral factories were localized using the specific anti-p72 antibody (gray), while ASFV-DP (green) was detected using our specific antiserum (Fig. 5A). In mock-infected cells, the cap structure was strongly localized in the nucleus and more diffusely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A, top row), in agreement with the fact that capped RNAs are present in both compartments. Interestingly, the cap signal in ASFV-infected cells was clearly increased in the cytoplasm, especially at the peripheries of viral factories, where it colocalized with ASFV-DP (Fig. 5A, bottom row). The observed decrease in the cap signals in the nuclei of infected cells may have been due to impairment of transcription, which is a common phenomenon during infection by cytolytic viruses (37\u201341). Importantly, the increased cap signal at the viral replication sites may correspond to capped viral mRNAs, which have previously been described surrounding these structures (26). In order to validate this hypothesis, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments to detect the locations of the poly(A) RNA, the cap structure, and ASFV-DP. COS-7 cells were infected with ASFV and a fluoresceinated oligo(dT) probe, the anti-cap antibody, and the anti-ASFV-DP antibody were added to identify both viral and cellular mRNAs, the cap structure, and the decapping protein, respectively (Fig. 5B). We observed that poly(A) mRNA was clearly detected at the viral factories in infected cells, where it colocalized with the cap structure and with ASFV-DP. No oligo(dT) signal was observed to be spread in the cytoplasm of infected cells, suggesting that the RNA detected might be viral mRNA. This result is consistent with the previous data and indicates that the cap signal observed in Fig. 5A was due to both capped mRNAs and liberated cap structures produced after the decapping activity of ASFV-DP, since not all the cap signal colocalized with the oligo(dT) signal (Fig. 5B). The fact that the capped RNAs colocalized with ASFV-DP supports the role of ASFV-DP as an in vivo decapping enzyme. It is noteworthy that the overall cap signal intensity was slightly but reproducibly enhanced in ASFV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material). ASFV infection caused a decrease in host mRNA levels as measured by RT-qPCR (Fig. 1B) and oligo(dT) hybridization (26); however, we did not observe such a decline in cap levels, likely due to the fact that the antibody used recognized both mRNA and free cap.",

The \u0394Nudix variant showed an intermediate phenotype, binding more RNA than the wt but less than the N-terminal (N-term) fragment (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results point to the ASFV-DP N terminus as the major mediator of RNA interaction. On the other hand, the Nudix motif, though indispensable for decapping activity in vitro (20, 28, 45, 46), does not seem to be essential for RNA binding.

RNA-protein interactions were immobilized by conventional cross-linking (cCL) (254-nm UV irradiation), as 4-thiouridine resulted in decreased expression of some viral proteins (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). GFP complexes were immunoprecipitated with GFP Trap_A beads (see below) and checked for quality by Western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody. MOV10-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-expressing cells were used as a positive control due to its well-known property as an RNA-binding protein, while unfused eGFP was used as a negative control (Fig. 7A) (42). RNA in the GFP_Trap eluates was analyzed by RT-qPCR using oligonucleotides against representative cellular (eIF4E and \u03b2-actin) and viral (A238L, A224L, and B646L) mRNAs. Interestingly, GFP\u2013ASFV-DP was able to bind both viral and cellular mRNAs in the context of ASFV infection, in contrast to the negative control, eGFP (Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the RNA-binding activity of ASFV-DP presented a degree of specificity, as mRNA from \u03b2-actin associated to a lesser extent than eIF4E mRNA (Fig. 7B). Since ASFV-DP selectively interacted with both cellular and viral RNAs, we hypothesized that it might be involved in both cellular shutoff and temporal regulation of viral protein expression.",

Therefore, viruses must manipulate cellular mRNA metabolism and translation, impairing host protein synthesis and liberating cellular resources in order to ensure and facilitate their own replication (4, 51). Our previous results demonstrated that ASFV causes a progressive decrease in poly(A) mRNA signal in the cytoplasm of infected cells, which is detectable at the peripheries of viral factories at late times postinfection (26). In this work, we found that ASFV triggers general degradation of cellular mRNA, as all cellular genes tested by RT-qPCR decreased after infection (Fig. 1B), concomitant with reduced cellular protein synthesis (25\u201327). The global degradation of host mRNAs should thus contribute to the host shutoff. General inhibition of host protein synthesis, or cellular shutoff, is accompanied by a simultaneous increase in viral protein synthesis (27). Conversely, the persistency of viral mRNA translation under these conditions implies that viral mRNA should be refractory (at least partially) to such degradation. Additionally, ASFV is known to exercise temporal control over the expression of its genes (24), a process that inherently involves regulation of both mRNA transcription and degradation.",

The authors proposed that, since the ASFV-DP sequence does not harbor any ER peptide signal, it probably associates with the ER on the cytosolic side without translocating into the ER lumen. They also suggested that this localization may be related to a specific activity of the protein. In this study, cosedimentation experiments demonstrated that ASFV-DP is present in different ribosomal fractions. Moreover, GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that ASFV-DP is able to interact with the ribosomal protein L23a (Fig. 4C; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). These data support ASFV-DP presence at the ER and translation complexes. Interestingly, it has been reported that other viral proteins implicated in mRNA regulation, such as the SOX endonuclease of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also cosediment with the 40S ribosomal subunit (14). It was suggested that SOX may be recruited to the mRNA by association with translation initiation machinery; it may be possible that ASFV uses a similar mechanism to facilitate decapping activity on translationally active host mRNAs. Moreover, the presence of ASFV-DP at the viral factories could correlate with the function of the protein as a regulator of viral mRNA stability (Fig. 3C and D).",

In mock-infected cells, cap signal is spread through the cell and accumulates in the nucleus. However, in ASFV-infected cells, cap-derived nuclear signal decreases, correlating with an increase in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, both poly(A) RNA and the cap signal partially colocalize with ASFV-DP at the peripheries of the viral factories at late times after infection (Fig. 5A and B). Viral mRNAs are present at the replication sites in VACV (53), while D10 is excluded from the viral factories (52). Hence, factory exclusion has been proposed as a strategy to avoid degradation of late viral mRNAs (18).",

In this work, we showed for the first time that ASFV-DP is able to bind RNA in cultured cells (Fig. 6B). Though substitutions for conserved glutamates of the Nudix motif impair decapping activity (28), we demonstrated that these mutations do not affect RNA binding (Fig. 6B).

Electrostatic surface analysis supported these results, revealing that the N terminus possesses a basic channel that may serve as an RNA-binding platform (Fig. 6D and E). A positively charged channel is also present on the dorsal surface of the Nudix regions of S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and human Dcp2 enzymes, and mutations of residues in this channel have been shown to decrease Dcp2 substrate affinity (48, 49, 56). However, the amino acids of this region are not clearly conserved in D10 and ASFV-DP (18, 57). Unlike the cap-binding cavity, basic amino acids of the positive channel are only loosely conserved at the primary-sequence level between SpDcp2 and ScDcp2 (18, 48). This suggests that the positive charge of the surface is the most important signature for RNA binding. Interestingly, when the modeling of the protein was done, we realized that the predicted Nudix motif and the C terminus of ASFV-DP are more similar to Dcp2 structure than the N terminus. ASFV-DP may possess an N-terminal surface with optimized RNA-binding characteristics compared to Dcp2. A reason could be that ASFV-DP function is not complemented by other proteins (as occurs with Dcp1), making ASFV-DP the only viral protein responsible for mRNA decapping during ASFV infection.",

The N-terminal domain thus suffices to bind RNA, suggesting that the Nudix motif, and thus ASFV-DP catalytic activity, is not required for interaction with RNA. However, ASFV-DP mediates the hydrolysis of the cap structure, and such a reaction should involve a transitory interaction with the RNA to allow RNA release after decapping. Interestingly, the ASFV-DP construct lacking the Nudix motif is also able to bind RNA, although to a lesser extent than the N-terminal fragment alone, suggesting that it is not the catalytic activity per se that determines the lower RNA-binding avidity of ASFV-DP (Fig. 6C). A plausible mechanistic explanation is that the interplay of the positively charged N-terminal domain with the highly acidic C terminus could increase the disassociation (off) rate in the RNA\u2013ASFV-DP complex (Fig. 6D). This is a likely explanation, since the acidic patch generated by the C terminus domain is in close proximity to the putative RNA-binding surface. Because the repulsion effect of the C terminus domain is lost in the N-terminal construct, it would likely increase the duration or the strength of the interaction with RNA (Fig. 6C). In agreement with our results, in vitro studies with human Dcp2 to identify the minimal region with decapping activity showed that a construct harboring an incomplete Nudix fold (and thus lacking enzymatic activity) was able to bind RNA (56). Further mutational studies affecting different regions of the ASFV-DP N-terminal region must be carried out to determine the precise amino acids implicated in RNA binding.",

            "text": "We have established that ASFV-DP not only binds cellular mRNA in cultured cells, but also binds host and viral mRNAs in the context of infection (Fig. 7B). The fact that ASFV-DP interacts with cellular mRNAs suggests that it is involved in cellular shutoff, while its interaction with viral mRNAs may be related to temporal viral gene regulation. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that when ectopically overexpressed, ASFV-DP causes a decrease of both cellular and viral mRNA levels (Fig. 7C and D). Additionally, ASFV-DP could interact with viral mRNA in order to avoid accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the cellular immune response, as has been described for D9 and D10 during VACV infection (58). ASFV-DP showed higher binding affinity for eIF4E mRNA than for actin mRNA (Fig. 7B), suggesting that it displays specific affinities for determinate cellular substrates. Selectivity in host mRNA degradation has been previously described in other viral systems, such as alphaherpesvirus (59) and VACV (60), whose D9, which presents higher affinity for the RNA body than D10, may be able to differentiate mRNA based on sequences (19). In a similar manner, ASFV may discriminate among cellular transcripts, using ASFV-DP as a tool to target specific cellular mRNAs. ASFV-DP has been shown to be more strongly inhibited by uncapped mRNAs than D9, and it is not affected by methylated cap analogs (28). Additionally, in vitro RNA-binding assays demonstrated that while ASFV-DP was able to interact with uncapped cellular mRNAs, the observed shift in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) was not complete (28). The authors suggest two explanations: the requirement for the cap structure to stabilize ASFV-DP\u2013RNA interaction and the fact that ASFV-DP displays strong affinity only for molecules with certain features. These explanations fit our data and are also in agreement with what has been described for Dcp2 (61, 62).",

ASFV-DP is the first ASFV protein reported to display this ability. Additionally, ASFV-DP is an RNA-binding protein able to interact with both cellular and viral mRNAs in the context of infection, which led to a decrease of both cellular and viral mRNAs when overexpressed. Taken together, these results indicate that ASFV-DP acts as a viral regulator of both cellular and viral mRNA metabolism, impairing cellular protein synthesis and ensuring viral temporal gene expression.",

For cCL, cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS at room temperature and then irradiated at 256 nm (0.15 J/cm2) on ice in the absence of PBS. Immediately after cross-linking, cold PBS was added to the cells, which were maintained at 4\u00b0C until collection (42). Cross-linking was performed with a SpectroLinker XL-1000 or XL-1500 (Spectronics Corp.). Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking (PAR-CL) was done following described protocols (42, 43): 100 \u03bcM 4-SU was added to plates for 2 to 16 h, and protein-RNA were cross-linked after irradiation with 365 nm UV light. After PAR-CL, samples were recovered following the same protocol as for cCL. For the dual-fluorescence analysis, 1.2 \u00d7 107 to 2.5 \u00d7 107 stable HeLa cells were induced with 1 \u03bcg/ml Tet for 20 h before harvesting. Samples were cross-linked by conventional or PAR methods and recovered for analysis as previously described (42). Briefly, GFP fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated using GFP-Trap_A beads, and the resulting complexes were incubated with oligo(dT)-Texas Red probe.

Both proteins were incubated with extracts of mock- or ASFV-infected Vero cells at 6 or 18 hpi, and after intensive washing, peptides associated with the GST complexes were sequenced by mass spectrometry (at the Proteomics Core Facility of CBMSO, Madrid, Spain). Briefly, equal quantities of the protein extracts were suspended in a volume of up to 50 \u03bcl of sample buffer and then applied to 1.2-cm-wide wells of a conventional SDS-PAGE gel (0.75 mm thick; 4% stacking and 10% resolving). The run was stopped as soon as the front entered 3 mm into the resolving gel, so that the whole proteome became concentrated in the stacking/resolving gel interface. The unseparated protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining, excised, cut into cubes (2 by 2 mm), and placed in 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (68). The gel pieces were destained in acetonitrile (ACN)-water (1:1), reduced and alkylated (disulfide bonds from cysteinyl residues were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] for 1 h at 56\u00b0C, and then the thiol groups were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in darkness), and digested in situ with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by Shevchenko et al. (69) with minor modifications. The gel pieces were shrunk by removing all liquid using sufficient ACN. The acetonitrile was pipetted out, and the gel pieces were dried in a SpeedVac. The dried gel pieces were reswollen in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8, with 60 ng/\u03bcl trypsin at a 5:1 (wt/wt) protein/trypsin ratio. The tubes were kept on ice for 2 h and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 h. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Whole supernatants were dried down and then desalted onto ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore) until the mass spectrometric analyses, which were performed for the three samples consecutively. The desalted protein digest was dried, resuspended in 8 \u03bcl of 0.1% formic acid, and analyzed by reverse phase (RP)\u2013LC\u2013MS-MS in an Agilent 1100 system coupled to a linear ion trap LTQ-Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography using a 0.18-mm by 150-mm Bio-Basic C18 RP column (Thermo Scientific) operating at 1.8 \u03bcl/min. Peptides were eluted using a 35-min gradient from 5 to 40% solvent B (solvent A, 0,1% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0,1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water). Electrospray ionization (ESI) was done using a microspray metal needle kit (Thermo Scientific) interface. Peptides were detected in survey scans from 400 to 1,600 atomic mass units (amu) (1 microscan), followed by 10 data-dependent MS-MS scans (Top 10), using an isolation width of 2 u (in mass/charge ratio units), a normalized collision energy of 35%, and dynamic exclusion applied in 30-s periods. Peptide identification from raw data was carried out using the SEQUEST algorithm (Proteome Discoverer 1.4; Thermo Scientific). A database search was performed against UniProt_VPPA_Ba71v, UniProt_Primates, and local databases. The following constraints were used for the searches: tryptic cleavage after Arg and Lys, up to two missed cleavage sites, and tolerances of 1 Da for precursor ions and 0.8 Da for MS-MS fragment ions. The searches were performed allowing optional Met oxidation and Cys carbamidomethylation. Searches against a decoy database (the integrated decoy approach) used a false-discovery rate (FDR) of <0.01. Enriched protein analyses after pulldown assays were done on the ConsensusPath.db website (Bioinformatics Group of the Vertebrate Genomics Department at the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, Germany [http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/]).",
