Arterial expression of Hp is enhanced after balloon dilatation and pertains to a unique set of glycoforms different from the synthesis product of the liver [14]. In cattle the mRNA of this protein has been found constitutively in mammary gland, leukocytes [15], and 33 further tissues with comparatively high concentrations in the exocrine pancreas and the submandibular salivary gland [16]. The expression of Hp could be shown to increase more than 80-fold in mammary gland cells after focal udder infection of dairy cows [8]. This could explain that the concentration of Hp in milk increases several hours earlier than in blood [17]. Moreover, Hp is also released into bronchial fluid in respiratory infection of pigs [18] and cattle [19], and into saliva. Salivary Hp is proposed to serve as early biomarker for porcine virus infections [20] and as a stress marker [21].",

            "text": "Many studies are available on serum concentrations of APPs after respiratory infection (for cattle, this is reviewed in [25]), but data of their concentrations in the lung as the site of infection and inflammation are scarce. In young pigs, influenza infection causes increased APP concentrations in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which are probably secreted by the respiratory tract epithelia. Here, concentrations increased steeply for LBP and moderately for C reactive protein (CRP) and Hp, the latter two showing higher maximal concentrations in blood serum [18]. A study in calves found higher concentrations of Hp and SAA in BALF supernatant of calves with bronchopneumonia than in healthy calves [26]. Taken together, this led to the hypothesis that due to their production in the lung, some APPs are suitable local biomarkers for respiratory inflammation. To address this, it is necessary to determine APP concentrations not only in blood, but also in BALF. From former studies in a bovine model of respiratory infection with Chlamydia (C.) psittaci and Parachlamydia (P.) acanthamoebae we knew that serum levels of some APPs increase after inoculation with these pathogens [27\u201334]. Prior to this study, data of LBP, Hp, lactoferrin (Lf), and CRP levels in blood of animals enrolled in former studies with the above mentioned model were summarized and are presented in Table 1. Briefly, after inoculation with C. psittaci, LBP and Hp increased significantly, and after inoculation with P. acanthamoebae we observed a significant increase of LBP and Lf in blood sera.",

Before the study, the herd of origin was regularly checked for the presence of Chlamydiae by the National Reference Laboratory for Psittacosis. Calves were purchased at the age of 15 to 27 days weighing between 47.2 and 71.2 kg. After a quarantine period of at least 21 days and confirmation of a clinically healthy status, animals were included in the study. Exclusion of co-infections and standard antibiotic treatment after purchase, i.e. about 3 weeks before challenge, was performed as described previously [31, 34]. Briefly, the presence of Mycoplasma, Pasteurella, or Mannheimia spp. was evaluated in nasal swabs taken immediately before challenge and before necropsy, as well as in lung tissue samples obtained during necropsy. Serology was used to check for antibodies against Mycoplasma bovis, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 3 virus, adenovirus type 3, bovine herpes virus 1, and bovine virus diarrhea/mucosal disease virus. Results did not suggest the presence of respiratory co-infections in any animal included in this study.",

ELISA-plates (96 well, flat-bottomed, high binding, Corning, New York, USA) were coated with 2 \u03bcg/ml IgG-anti-BSA (from sheep, affinity purified, Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, Texas, USA) in 0.1 M NaHCO3. After incubation the plates were washed two times with 0.154 M NaCl and 0.05 % (v/v) Tween 20 (wash solution) by using a 12 canal microtiter plate washer (NUNC, Wiesbaden, Germany). The standard was bovine serum albumin (purity about 98 %, Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie Steinheim, Germany) in the concentration range between 80 and 1.25 ng/ml. The BALF samples were diluted 1:400 or higher. The assay buffer for dilution was phosphate-buffered saline (PBS according to Dulbecco, pH 7.35) with 0.2 % (v/v) Tween 20 and 10 mM Na2EDTA. After incubation and four times of washing with wash solution, the horseradish peroxidase conjugate of IgG-anti-BSA (from sheep, affinity purified, Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, Texas, USA) was diluted in assay buffer to 1:20 000, and was added to the wells. The plates were incubated, washed four times, and the horseradish peroxidase was determined with the colorimetric substrate 3 mM H2O2 and 1 mM 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine in 0.2 M citrate buffer (pH 3.95). The reaction was stopped with 1 M H2SO4 (50 \u03bcl per well). The optical density (OD-value) was measured with a microplate-ELISA-reader at 450 nm. The standard curve (BSA standard-concentrations vs. OD-values) was determined using TableCurve software (Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany) and the concentrations of BSA in samples were then calculated by consideration of the dilution factor.",

Concentration of \u03b2-globulins in the blood serum started to drop after inoculation and was significantly lower than pre-inoculational values on 3 and 5 dpi (Fig. 4d). Baseline level was reached again 10 dpi. The amount of \u03b3-globulins in the blood serum was slightly reduced after inoculation; changes were only significant 2 dpi (Fig. 4e). The albumin/globulin-quotient was significantly reduced from 2 to 14 dpi with a minimum on 7 dpi (Fig. 4f).",

All animals developed signs of acute respiratory disease with fever within 36 h pi, with a maximum on 2 and 3 dpi. Clinical signs resolved within one week. Changes in the peripheral blood count were dominated by an increase of neutrophilic granulocytes with a regenerative left shift, followed by leukopenia. From 2 to 9 dpi, increased amounts of neutrophilic granulocytes were found in BALF. Histopathologically, fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia with multifocal areas of necrosis and pleuritis was seen in the lungs of infected animals.

In blood samples of these animals, we found significant changes in LBP-, albumin- and \u03b1-,\u03b2- and \u03b3-globulin concentrations. In supernatants of BALF, we could verify changes in the absolute concentrations and in the [local marker]/[BSA]-quotients for LBP, Hp, and Lf, which paralleled the clinical course as well as signs of local and systemic inflammation.

The APP LBP showed an increase which paralleled the course of the respiratory score. Levels of the negative APP albumin dropped after onset of chlamydial infection in all animals. Blood levels of both, BSA and LBP correlated with clinical signs, with the correlation of BSA being stronger than the one of LBP. This interesting fact underlines the known importance of BSA and LBP as systemic APPs and markers of inflammation in bovines. The decreased albumin/globulin-quotient resulted from reduced albumin and increased \u03b1-globulin concentrations. Raised concentrations of \u03b1-globulins after infection were due to an increase of acute phase proteins such as \u03b11-antitrypsin, Hp and \u03b12-macroglobulin, which are major components of this fraction. The decrease of the concentration of the \u03b2-globulin fraction might result from a decrease of transferrin concentrations. Transferrin is the main part of the \u03b2-globulin fraction and considered a negative acute phase protein in cattle [42].

Since their actual concentrations showed high variability\u2014probably due to the variability of the amount of fluid recovered during lavage and on the actual area of the lung that was lavaged [43, 44]\u2014we tried to harmonize the measured values by normalization. Since no other origin than the liver is known, albumin could be a suitable marker for the degree of plasma leakage, i.e., the inflammatory increase of permeability of lung endo\u2014and epithelia. While the correlation between albumin concentration in blood and clinical signs was present throughout the whole study, albumin concentrations in BALF only correlated with clinical signs in the acute phase of the disease (4 dpi). This confirms the suitability of albumin concentrations in BALF for the normalization of the concentrations of local markers in BALF as performed in this study. When the ratio of [local marker]/[BSA] remains constant throughout the time interval analyzed, the local marker can be considered solely as blood derived, whereas local production of the marker leads to an increase of this ratio. For LBP and Lf, the time dependent course was more distinct for the [local marker]/[BSA] ratio than for the local concentration alone.",

This correlates with our experience, that LBP in the blood of calves is a very reliable acute phase marker in respiratory disease [30, 27, 31, 45]. Increased LBP-levels have been reported in the BALF of pigs after viral infection [18, 46] and it was shown in vitro that pneumocytes of type II are capable of producing LBP [22], all supporting the hypothesis, that LBP can be produced in the lung as a local reaction to the inoculation with C. psittaci. In contrast to the other local markers analyzed in this study, LBP concentrations were significantly higher in infected animals than in healthy controls, and their variability is rather low. The most distinct changes were visible during the acute phase of the disease. Furthermore, concentrations of LBP in the BALF parallel the respiratory score and the systemic acute phase reaction as represented by LBP-, albumin- and globulin-concentrations in the blood. Together with its correlation with the respiratory score, this makes LBP the most promising candidate for a local marker of respiratory inflammation in cattle.",

Hp concentrations were also shown to increase in the mammary gland [8] and in the broncho-alveolar fluid [19] upon local infection. Hp has already been detected in the BALF of calves inoculated with Pasteurella haemolytica [49]. Also, it could be shown that the haptoglobin gene is upregulated in the inflamed human lung [50]. In contrast to these results, in C. psittaci infected calves the [Hp]/[BSA]-quotient in BALF showed a time dependent decrease. Moreover, the [Hp]/[BSA]-quotient in healthy animals was as high as in diseased animals 4 dpi, not allowing discrimination of the latter group. However, there is a significant relationship between Hp concentration in BALF supernatant and the respiratory score of animals inoculated with C. psittaci, suggesting that there is an association between disease severity and amount of Hp in the lung. Further investigations with larger numbers of animals are needed to investigate this aspect and to clarify, whether Hp is a useful local marker for bovine lung disease.",

Lf is the only protein analyzed in this study with concentrations much higher in BALF supernatant of healthy and diseased animals than in the blood of healthy calves (cf. Tables 1 and 2), strongly supporting the local production of this protein. Resident neutrophilic granulocytes are the most likely source of Lf in lung [54]. The process of broncho-alveolar lavage leads to very mild focal alteration of the lung [55], being a possible instant stimulus for degranulation and increasing the local Lf concentration. The [Lf]/[BSA]-quotients measured here were similar in healthy controls and infected animals 4 dpi and dropped towards the end of our study. Since the increases of Lf-levels in blood are maximal already 12 h after inoculation with Mannheimia haemolytica in calves (Schroedl, unpublished data) it is possible that after inoculation with C. psittaci even higher levels of Lf might be detectable in BALF much earlier than 4 dpi. This could mean that local Lf is depleted in the course of the infection, and that initial Lf levels in BALF represent a local defense mechanism due to its antibacterial and antiviral properties [56]. Due to the increased anesthetic risk in animals with systemic disease and dyspnea, no bronchoscopy was performed earlier than 4 dpi in the present study. To clarify whether Lf concentrations in supernatant of BALF would increase at earlier time points, further studies with BALF sampling early after inoculation would be necessary.",
