            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of branching tubules that extends throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and serves multiple functions. Once protein is translated by ER\u2010associated ribosomes, it enters into the ER lumen and is folded in a chaperon\u2010assisted manner. Additional complex modifications occur before the protein is transported to Golgi. Appropriate protein folding and post\u2010translational modification are crucial for protein function. Aggregated misfolded proteins in the ER cause cellular stress, which if unresolved can lead to cell death. Despite the stringent regulation around protein folding and redundancy within the chaperone\u2010assisted folding process, both endogenous and exogenous triggers can disrupt the ER homeostasis and increase protein misfolding. These triggers include but are not limited to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and disruption by chemical inhibitors of polypeptide N\u2010linked glycosylation (e.g. tunicamycin) or calcium flux (e.g. thapsigargin), oxidative stress and infection. As a result, the ER has evolved a regulatory network, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), to control the protein folding process. The UPR activation involves three major downstream effects including reduction in protein synthesis to reduce ER load, enhancement of ER protein folding capacity and upregulation of ER\u2010associated protein degradation (ERAD). If homeostasis is not regained, the UPR will redirect the balance of signalling to favor autophagy or apoptosis. It is increasingly recognised that the evolutionary conserved UPR signalling has an important role in mucosal inflammation and infection. In this review, we discuss the role of the UPR in maintaining mucosal epithelial cell integrity and barrier function and highlight how the UPR is regulated by the host innate immunity.",

This spliced form of XBP1 then translates into a transcription factor, which further translocates into the nucleus where it induces expression of a wide variety of genes including ER\u2010associated chaperones and protein folding enzymes to increase ER size and folding capacity. A separate IRE1\u03b1\u2010dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) pathway is also described (Figure 1).1 RIDD degrades mRNAs to ultimately reduce ER load and subsequently reduce the UPR activation. However, with prolonged ER stress IRE1\u03b1 becomes hyperactive and degrades mRNAs associated with anti\u2010apoptotic responses, promoting cell death. IRE1\u03b2 (also known as ERN2) is abundantly expressed by intestine and lung epithelial cells.2 Compared to IRE1\u03b1, the role of IRE1\u03b2 in the UPR is not very well studied.

ER stress occurs in mice that mount a TH1/17 response (low\u2010dose infection), which show goblet cell pathology and fail to clear the infection. However, mice that mount a TH2 response (high\u2010dose infection) show high levels of goblet cell protein biosynthesis and secretion and go on to clear the infection. These data support our hypothesis of specific cytokines modulating protein production. Interestingly, ER stress is not observed in the immunodeficient mice that have chronic T. muris infection, strengthening our hypothesis of host intrinsic\u2010induced cytokines being responsible for the activation of the UPR and induction of ER stress. We suggest that inflammatory cytokines have evolved to disrupt protein biosynthesis in cells prone to viral infection such as mucosal epithelial cells in order to reduce viral replication as a hereto\u2010unrecognised element of the immune response.",

Under such conditions, autophagy pathways are often served as scaffold for viral entry or served as inter\u2010cellular organelle to foster viral replication, suppressing innate immunity through insufficient viral protein presentation and preventing cell death.70 The immune system has developed alternative ways to interrupt viral protein synthesis.

Therefore, along with IL\u201010\u2010mediated immunosuppressive effects on the immune cells, IL\u201010\u2010induced protein production (via the regulation of the UPR) would allow for increased viral replication in these highly productive secretory cells.

Better understanding of the contribution of ER stress\u2010associated UPR response in viral infection process, temporal sequence of events and pathways to initiation of chronic inflammation and tissue damage is imperative. Understanding how immune responses and inflammatory cytokines regulate UPR in viral infection is crucial, because boosting this physiological process via cytokines could open the way to novel approaches to limit viral replication and acute disease, and rescue individuals with persistent inflammation and associated tissue damage. Clearly, the UPR is intimately involved in viral replication: manipulating ER stress and UPR signalling could potentially limit viral replication and attenuate acute viral infections. Reduction in epithelial cell UPR activation in chronic disease provides an opportunity to limit persistent mucosal inflammation and the extent of tissue damage. The timing and nature of the cytokine response dictate time taken for both viral clearance and restoration of mucosal integrity and homeostasis.
