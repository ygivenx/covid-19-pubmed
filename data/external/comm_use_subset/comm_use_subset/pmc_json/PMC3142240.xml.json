            "text": "Insect genomics is a relatively new field of research. Since the report of the fruit fly genome sequence in 2000 [1], several other insect genomes have been completed including three mosquitoes species, silkworm, honeybee, red flour beetle, pea aphid, three closely related parasitoid wasps and human body louse [2-5]. A considerable number of other insect genomes are in progress [6]. In parallel, high throughput tools for functional studies in insects are being developed. For example, Gateway-based vectors applicable for the subcellular localization analysis of proteins in cultured Bombyx mori cells became available [7]. Also important, new insect promoters for gene expression studies are being isolated and characterized [8] and an insect two-hybrid system to analyze protein interactions in cultured insect cells has been reported [9]. Planthoppers (order Hemiptera, superfamily Fulgoroidea) are severe pests of plants because of their sucking damage and ability to transmit at least 18 phytopathogenic viruses [10]. For example, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens is a serious pest of rice in tropical Asia and propagatively transmits Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV, Oryzavirus genus of the Reoviridae family), Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV, genus Tenuivirus) [11] and Nilaparvata lugens reovirus (NLRV, Fijivirus genus of the Reoviridae family) [12]. In turn, the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus transmits Rice stripe virus (RSV, genus Tenuivirus) and Rice black streak dwarf virus (RBSDV, Fijivirus genus of the Reoviridae family) [13,14] and the planthopper Peregrinus maidis transmits Maize mosaic virus (MMV: Nucleorhabdovirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family) [15]. Another planthopper species, Delphacodes kuscheli, is a natural vector that propagatively transmits Mal de R\u00edo Cuarto virus (MRCV, Fijivirus genus of the Reoviridae family). MRCV causes the most important maize disease in Argentina and its genome sequence has recently been completed [16-19].",

This information will certainly contribute to the unveiling of molecular events underlying virus transmission by insects. In particular, very little is known regarding the effects of persistent virus infection on planthoppers transcriptome and new robust and accurate methods for gene expression studies will be required. Most recently, massive Laodelphax striatellus parallel pyrosequencing-based transcriptome analyses was performed in both na\u00efve and RSV-infected insects and several planthopper genes diferentially expressed during virus infection were identified [22].",

However, because housekeeping gene expression is not always stable and might vary depending on the samples or treatments, it is necessary to first study the stability of several endogenous gene expression in order to select suitable internal references [23]. Thus, stability analysis of reference genes in diverse conditions and organisms are rapidly increasing [24-34]. Even though the behavior of insect housekeeping genes has been studied in bacterially challenged bees [30] and in Tribolium beetles infected with fungus [28], this kind of information is lacking for virus-infected insects. In addition, there is no information currently available on reference gene stability in Delphacodes kuscheli or any other planthopper for accurate quantification of mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. Our study aimed to examine the stability of potential reference genes expression upon MRCV infection of single D. kuscheli planthoppers and to rank them according to their reliability as internal controls. As a result, a robust RT-qPCR platform was set up for analyzing changes on gene expression upon virus infection in individual planthoppers.",

To obtain MRCV-infective insects, 5 III instar D. kuscheli nymphs were fed on a MRCV-infected oat plant for two days. Next, the insects were moved to a cage and fed on uninfected wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Prointa federal) seedlings (displaying one fully developed leaf) for 19 days to achieve the optimum latency period [35]. Subsequently, each insect was placed on an individual uninfected wheat seedling for 24 h (inoculation period) and then fixed in absolute EtOH until use. Finally, after 25 days, the MRCV transmission to the wheat plants was individually determined by monitoring the presence of virus symptoms and by DAS-ELISA.",

MRCV replication in plant phloem cells (where it produces severe cytopathic effects) and in planthopper vector tissues (where it establishes a persistent propagative infection) probably involves a differential regulation of gene expression in each case. To study these still unknown gene regulation processes in insects, reliable reference genes must be selected as internal controls to perform gene expression analysis. Consequently, planthoppers undoubtedly able to transmit MRCV are needed to analyze variations on potential reference gene expression levels with respect to na\u00efve insects. One-to-one transmission assays were performed to obtain MRCV-infective insects as described in Methods. As a result, only 4 out of 50 independently evaluated insects were capable of successfully transmitting MRCV to wheat. This transmission efficiency was similar to the reported previously for this kind of assays [35]. Only planthoppers able to transmit MRCV to wheat plants (infective insects) were kept for subsequent RT-qPCR studies along with control na\u00efve insects subjected to the same procedure but always fed on uninfected plants.",

In addition, a primer amplification performance test by real time RT-qPCR showed that all primer combinations yield a single amplicon and the absence of primer dimers formation in the dissociation step (data not shown). The PCR amplification efficiency of each set of primers was evaluated using the LinReg software which performs, for each individual sample, a baseline correction and a PCR efficiency calculation from the linear portion of the amplification curve slope by linear regression and then calculates a mean PCR efficiency for each primer pair [36]. The calculated PCR efficiency means ranged from 82% for UBI and TUB to 55% for 18S (Table 1). The 18S primer pair low PCR efficiency might have been caused by incomplete annealing due to mismatches, given that their design was based on a related species sequence.",

As a mean for normalization of the sample input, equal amounts of total RNA (500 ng) from each planthopper were treated with DNAse I to remove possible genomic DNA contamination and then used for cDNA synthesis by retrotranscription as detailed previously. Parallel reactions without RT enzyme were performed and used for RT-PCR amplification as an additional control to check that no contaminating genomic DNA was present (Additional file 3). Finally, RT-qPCR experiments were carried as described in Methods. The full sample set including both infective and na\u00efve planthoppers was subjected to each gene expression analysis to avoid between-run variations and three independent technical replicates were performed for each sample in all the experiments. The raw data obtained from each experiment was processed using the LinReg software for baseline correction and the resulting cycle threshold (Ct) values were used in candidate gene expression stability analysis by three different methods using geNorm [37], Normfinder [38] and Bestkeeper [40] tools.",

According to the ranking of stability generated, ACT was the most stable gene with M= 0.4738, followed by UBI, GADPH, 18S and RPS18 with similar M coefficients. On the other hand, EF1A and TUB were listed as the most unstable genes with M > 1.2 (Figure 1A). Next, by performing a stepwise exclusion of the least stable gene and recalculating the M value for the remaining genes, geNorm detected that the most stable pair of reference genes was ACT/GAPDH (Figure 2A) which displayed the first and third place in the individual stability ranking. Finally, starting with the two most stable genes, the program calculates the pair-wise variation V of two consecutive normalization factors (NF) that result from stepwise introduction of another gene (the one with the lowest M remaining) [37]. This analysis showed that if we consider the generally adopted threshold of V = 0.15 [37,41,42], the inclusion of a third gene does not result in any appreciable improvement of the normalization factor. Moreover, the V values resulting from adding a third, fourth and fifth gene were low (V < 0.015) and the threshold was only reached when adding the two most unstable genes (Figure 2B). Thus, these results indicated that only the 2 most stable genes are needed for a reliable normalization.",

As shown in Figure 3A, the Ct values of the candidate genes were distributed from 15 to 34, in which the lowest Ct (and highest expression) corresponded to 18S and the highest Ct to GAPDH. The high expression level of the 18S rRNA is expected as it is one of the most abundant RNA species in the cell. Moreover, ACT second lowest Ct is in agreement with the usually abundant actin mRNA in cells [20]. It is important to note that the four genes consensually detected as the most reliable (UBI, 18S, ACT and RPS18) covered a relatively wide Ct range (15-28). It is convenient to count with several reference genes of diverse Ct values, because the use of internal controls with a Ct close to that of the gene whose expression is being studied is preferable.",

The Ct values obtained for each gene were compared in MRCV-infective against na\u00efve planthoppers and the statistical significance of Ct differences between treatments was calculated by the Mann-Whitney t test using the Graphpad Prism 5 software. Interestingly, EF1A expression was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in MRCV-infective planthoppers (Figure 3B). This fact explains the instability of EF1A gene expression previously detected when using a pool of infective and na\u00efve insects (Figure 1). In agreement, EF1A gene expression has been reported to be 97.8 times more abundant in RSV-infected versus na\u00efve small brown planthoppers [22]. It would be interesting to extend this study to a higher number of Delphacodes kuscheli genes, including antiviral genes of the innate immunity and RNAi pathways, to further establish if their expression is altered during persistent MRCV replication in its planthopper vector.",

In particular planthoppers transmit many important viral diseases and the molecular basis underling insect-virus interactions are relatively poorly studied. Here, a RT-qPCR platform useful for gene expression analysis in virus infected planthoppers was developed. The evaluation of several D. kuscheli housekeeping genes expression stability showed that the UBI gene is the most reliable as internal reference control for mRNA quantification in MRCV-infective planthoppers. On the other hand, the EF1A gene was upregulated in MRCV-infected planthoppers so it shouldn't be used as an internal control. Our work is the first report on reference gene selection in virus-infected insects, and might serve as a precedent for future gene expression studies on virus-planthopper pathosystems. Particularly, these results will surely contribute to the study of gene expression profiles in D. kuscheli in the context of MRCV infection. The RT-qPCR platform developed along this work will also be useful for normalizing viral titers in insect vectors, contributing to the already developed platforms for viral quantification in vectors and to new molecular studies of transmission and epidemiology [45-50]. Finally, the study of gene expression patterns in virus-transmitting arthropods will not only improve our knowledge of the virus-vector pathosystems but might also impact in the design of new strategies for virus control.",
