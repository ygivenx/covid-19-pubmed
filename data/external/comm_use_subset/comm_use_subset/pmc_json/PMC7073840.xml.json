Since then, cases have been recorded in other countries, and initial estimates suggest a hospital fatality risk of around 14% [6], although estimates of disease severity early in an outbreak are often imprecise [7,8,9]. Even countries without confirmed cases have been on high alert. For example, even prior to the two cases in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2020, officials were reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2000 visitors that had travelled to that country from Wuhan [10].",

We fit an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation. This provides an estimate of the risk that imported cases generate sustained outbreaks in new locations under different surveillance levels.",

Since the precise times of symptom onset and hospitalisation on the dates concerned were unknown, we converted the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation to intervals describing possible time periods (see the Supplementary Data). For example, for a case showing symptoms on 9 January 2020, and then being hospitalised on 14 January 2020, the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation lies between four and six days (see e.g., Supplementary Material of [16] for a similar calculation). This is because the minimum possible period involves symptom onset at the end of 9 January and hospitalisation at the start of 14 January, whereas the maximum possible period involves symptom onset early on 9 January and hospitalisation late on 14 January.",

In this branching process, the effective reproduction number (accounting for control interventions, other than intensified surveillance which we model explicitly) of the 2019-nCoV when the virus arrives in a new location is denoted by R=\u03b2/\u03b3, where the parameter \u03b2 represents pathogen transmissibility [20]. We assumed that the transmissibility of the virus is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, i.e., \u03b2=RSARS\u03b3SARS, where RSARS=3 [21] and the mean infection duration for SARS is 1/\u03b3SARS=3.8 days [22]. However, we adjusted the infectious period to account for the data describing the times between symptom onset and hospitalisation in the current outbreak. In doing this, we assumed that the time between an individual first displaying symptoms and being hospitalised was the period in which that individual was potentially transmitting the virus in the community.",

As additional information becomes available, it will be possible to estimate the risk of outbreaks in new locations with more precision. We made the assumption that symptom appearance coincides with the onset of infectiousness. One of the features of the SARS outbreak in 2002\u20132003 that allowed it to eventually be brought under control was the low proportion of onward transmissions occurring either prior to symptoms or from asymptomatic infectious hosts [26]. It might be hoped that infections due to the 2019-nCoV share this characteristic. Some reports have suggested that this may not be the case, although the extent of presymptomatic transmission is disputed [25,27]. We are working on an updated version of our analyses that includes the possibility of transmission from presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic hosts (based on the \u201cSEAIR\u201d compartmental model [19]).",

Our results might therefore be viewed as an upper bound on the risk posed by the 2019-nCoV. As the outbreak continues, it might be expected that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation or isolation will decrease, leading to lower risks of sustained transmission, as has been observed for outbreaks of other diseases (e.g., the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Initial indications suggest that such a decrease is occurring in China for this outbreak. In contrast, there may be some individuals that developed symptoms, but had not yet reported their infection by the time our analysis was conducted. \u201cRight censoring\u201d in this way favours lower reporting times, and so falsely reduces estimates of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation [16,28].",

Another possibility might be to account more explicitly for heterogeneities between different infectors, either by incorporating \u201csuperspreaders\u201d [29] in the model or by differentiating between individuals that report disease at different rates. Such heterogeneity might be expected to reduce the risk of sustained transmission (for a preliminary analysis, in which individuals can either be \u201cfast reporters\u201d or \u201cslow reporters\u201d, see the Supplementary Text). It would also be possible to differentiate between mild and severe cases in the model. On the one hand, a mild case might be more likely to go unnoticed than a severe case, potentially leading to a higher outbreak risk. On the other hand, mild infections may generate fewer secondary cases than severe infections, thereby decreasing the outbreak risk. Complex interactions may therefore affect the risk of sustained transmission in an unpredictable fashion.",
