            "text": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are widely thought to represent the best means of preventing HIV infection, making development of an immunogen capable of raising bnAbs a cornerstone and priority of vaccine development efforts [1,2]. Unfortunately, various factors relating both to the characteristics of known bnAbs as well as the HIV virus itself have pointed toward substantial obstacles to the realization of this goal. The sequence diversity and instability of the trimer, its heavily glycosylated structure, low surface density on the viral particle, and limited access to functionally critical epitopes have confounded efforts to induce bnAbs by vaccination [1,3]. Furthermore, cues from natural infection suggest that monoclonal bnAbs are uncommon, arise after years of infection and high viral load, fail to control established infection, must have precisely oriented binding interactions, and often have unusual properties [4\u201311], indicating that without a fundamental breakthrough in immunogen design, the generation of such bnAbs by vaccination is likely to remain a daunting challenge [12,13].",

These and other bnAbs have greatly informed immunogen design, highlighting new regions of the envelope trimer, variable loops, envelope glycan, the membrane proximal region, novel quaternary epitopes, and receptor and co-receptor binding sites as epitopes with a combination of sufficient conservation and functional relevance to be key targets of an effective antibody response. It is anticipated that with the continued use of high-throughput B-cell screening methods, the set of bnAbs with different fine-epitope specificities and viral coverage will continue to grow and provide a rich set of probes to reinvigorate and diversify immunogen design efforts. However, a high-throughput and adaptable platform is required to ensure these findings are efficiently translated into candidate immunogen development.",

In the absence of replicating vectors, it is difficult to envision how similar levels of antigen exposure could be accomplished via vaccination. Additionally, envelope diversity may be a key driver in the generation of neutralization breadth, posing another fundamental challenge. Together, the antigen exposure associated with natural infection likely represents both orders of magnitude greater levels and diversity than can be achieved by current strategies, leading to the discouraging conclusion that a successful immunogen may need to possess an orders of magnitude improved capacity to elicit bnAbs over natural envelope.",

YSD allows the display of millions of sequence variants and selection based on flexible design criteria to allow efficient and deep coverage of the envelope structure:function landscape, representing a potentially enabling technology for the rapid translation of findings from basic studies to the development of novel candidate immunogens. As such, YSD has been established as a powerful method to engineer diverse proteins for a broad range of functional improvements, including stability, specificity, affinity, catalysis, and enantioselectivity [28\u201331]. Routinely, variants with million-fold improvements can be isolated from large libraries, and repeated cycling of mutagenesis and selection has resulted in evolution of some of the highest affinity synthetic interactions ever observed [32]. Indeed, promising efforts aimed at the development of scaffolded epitopes and gp120 cores with desirable properties such as enhanced recognition of germline antibody families have routinely relied upon such combinatorial approaches and YSD-based directed evolution [33,34]. However, yeast expression and display of complete gp120, much less gp140, has not been described.",

A JR-FL gp140 variant with the SOSIP mutations served as starting point because it has previously been engineered for stability and homogeneity, was well-expressed in mammalian cells [35\u201337] and because the SOSIP mutations proved key to enabling structural insights into the native HIV-1 envelope trimer [38\u201341]. We have applied random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling in combination with stringent VRC01 driven selections to isolate gp140 SOSIP variants with significantly enhanced expression and that bind to conformational HIV bnAbs, suggesting proper antigenicity. The yeast-displayed gp140 SOSIP variants described here demonstrate the feasibility of production of HIV envelope in yeast, and the advantages of this robust platform in evolving variant envelopes. If trimeric presentation can be confirmed or further engineered, YSD may prove a robust platform for the rapid evolution and selection of promising vaccine immunogens.",

Whereas mammalian cell lines are relatively slow growing, and achieving the single genotype-phenotype linkage requires viral transfections or other rather cumbersome and time-consuming methodologies, the yeast S. cerevisiae is a robust and well-described eukaryotic host for cell-surface display [42]. Yeast are capable of displaying complex mammalian glycoproteins such as antibody fragments, full-length antibodies, peptide-MHC molecules, or growth factor receptors [42\u201345], as well as a growing number of viral envelope proteins of fragments thereof such as hemagglutinin, the gp120 core, Dengue E protein, SARS-CoV, West Nile Virus envelope, and the Hepatitis C Virus envelope protein E2 [46\u201351], suggesting that the display of HIV envelope protein is feasible in principle. Nevertheless, in S. cerevisiae, N-linked glycans are extended and mannose-rich [52], though P. pastoris yeast strains with human or human-like N-linked glycosyation have been reported to overcome this limitation [53,54].",

The mannose-rich N-glycosylation in YVH10 is trimmed to a more human-like 5-mannose stem in engineered Pichia, which may promote proper protein folding and conformational Ab recognition. However, we found that Pichia-produced gp120 did not display a clearly improved binding profile across a panel of bnAbs (S1 Fig.). Furthermore, P. pastoris-produced gp120 appeared somewhat more fragmented on a Western blot, suggesting more proteolytic degradation as compared to S. cerevisiae. Therefore, and because of the well-established and characterized Aga1/2-based display system, S. cerevisiae was chosen as host for HIV spike protein display.",

Notably, proteins were not secreted as Aga2 fusions in this study. Firstly, both gp120 fragments and full-length gp120 could be secreted at clearly detectable levels, but not full-length SOSIP gp140. Secondly, the omission of the fusion peptide clearly enhanced secretion of gp41, suggesting that its omission or modification may also improve full-length gp140 secretion. Thirdly, gp120 collapsed near its expected MW of 52 kDa after treatment with N-glycosidase PNGase F, suggesting extensive N-glycosylation (Fig. 1B and 1C). Based on these findings, we rationally designed a JR-FL SOSIP-based gp140 (designed, or d-SOSIP) with some modifications: codons were optimized for S. cerevisiae [55]; hydrophobic amino acids within the fusion peptide were replaced by structurally related but more hydrophilic residues, which if possible were found among circulating viral sequences (Fig. 1D); and lastly the Furin protease cleavage site was substituted with a yeast Kex2 recognition site, and a predicted internal Kex2 site was removed. We then compared secreted protein content in cell culture supernatant and found that d-SOSIP, but not the initial JR-FL SOSIP gp140 could be detected at significant levels. The d-SOSIP variant was significantly N-glycosylated, and collapsed after PNGase F-treatment (S1C Fig.).",

Notably, gp120 core epitopes are included in d-SOSIP, while the gp120 core lacks many of the epitopes of d-SOSIP, including variable loop and gp41-associated epitopes (Fig. 1A). Induced yeast cells always included a population that did not display the heterologous protein, which is a feature of the Aga2 display system [42]. The d-SOSIP constructs showed extremely low display levels as compared to the gp120 core (Fig. 2B), and only somewhat above background binding of the CD4bs-specific VRC01 Ab (Fig. 2C). However, standardizing the binding of HIV-specific Abs when variable display level was taken into account lead to detectable binding across a wide range of Ab specificities, including conformational, linear, and glycan-dependent sites. Yeast-displayed d-SOSIP bound well to the V3-specific Ab 447\u201352D and to MPER Abs, as might be expected due to their ability to bind to unconstrained peptides. Surprisingly, low but reproducible signal was observed, suggestive of recognition by glycan and trimer-preferring antibodies such as PGT121/126 [56] and PG9/16 [24] (Fig. 2D and S2 Table). Furthermore, the d-SOSIP D368R substitution was observed to reduce binding of CD4bs antibodies. Nonetheless, the low signal relative to gp120 core for many of the antibodies tested clearly indicated significant room for improvement, which might be achieved by coupling the rational design modifications made thus far with directed evolution strategies.",

Conformation-dependent mAbs that specifically bind to discontinuous epitopes served as molecular probes for properly folded antigens. Here, the d-SOSIP library was extensively screened for improved binding to the conformation-dependent CD4bs bnAb VRC01, which mimics the natural ligand CD4 in its mode of binding[57]. The pool of clones selected was further diversified to up to 7.7x107 members during two additional cycles of error prone PCR and repeated FACS selection for improved binding to either VRC01 (track 1), alternating enrichment based on binding to HIV CD4bs Abs VRC01, CH31 or PGV04 (track 2), or against a pooled mix of the five CD4bs mAbs VRC01, PGV04, CH31, b12 and b6 (track 3), as described in Table 1. These mAbs were chosen because they all bind to the conformational, conserved and functionally critical CD4bs, while being different in sequence and paratope, so as to minimize the risk of selecting specific affinity-enhancing contact residues instead of general structurally stabilizing mutations. A comparative binding analysis of the initial d-SOSIP and the selected pools from cycle 2 onward showed enhanced binding not only to target bnAb VRC01, but also to non-target CD4bs mAb b6, suggesting a generally improved structural representation of the conformational CD4bs epitope (Fig. 3B), as VRC01 and b6 significantly differ in their epitope footprints within the CD4bs [58,59]. DNA sequencing revealed that two dominating and distinct clusters of sequences had been enriched (S3A Fig.). To select for combinatorial mutants with further improved binding properties among those clusters, and to remove structurally disruptive mutations that likely had been co-selected, d-SOSIP and the 3.3 pool variants were DNA-shuffled [60] at a 1:1 ratio, and then subjected to an additional three rounds of FACS following selection tracks 1, 2 and 3. The selected 4.3 population pools showed both greatly enhanced expression and binding to CD4bs mAbs VRC01 and b6 as compared to the 3.3 pool selected before DNA shuffling (Fig. 3), while there was no difference in binding observed between tracks 1, 2 and 3 (S4 Fig.).",

Their side chains are buried within the protein or located in small cavities and do not appear to directly contact CD4bs mAbs (Fig. 5B), suggesting that structurally stabilizing mutations have been selected. Interestingly, mutated residues H66Q and W112R may form hydrogen bonds stabilizing helices within the inner domain of gp120. Similarly, I424N may form a novel hydrogen bond with Y384 (Fig. 5C). Mutation N156I disrupts an N-glycosylation motif located within the V1/V2 loop region. Three additional gp120 mutations that were lost after shuffling (T50A, L122F, and S209T) were all surface located, suggesting that surface-located mutations may not be essential to improved protein folding in yeast. The mutations found within gp41 could not be mapped due to disordered electron density in this particular region of the SOSIP crystal structure.

However, vaccination with mimetic peptides failed to induce Abs that bound to gp120 [65]. Other more recent approaches have been based on a subtractive principle, in which the immunogenic features of the antigen which lead to non-neutralizing but immunodominant antibody responses were removed or masked with glycans [58,66,67], or even more dramatically, on the direct grafting of functionally relevant sites onto alternative scaffolds [68\u201370], with the goal of focusing the immune response on functionally relevant epitopes. The subtraction of alternative epitopes, however, may not actively promote a response against the desired epitope, and may rather result in a blunted immune response, in which the titer of Ab recognizing the selected epitope is not enhanced, but the total antibody response is decreased. While mixed success has recently been reported from these efforts in the setting of HIV [71], the subtraction of epitopes may unnecessarily constrain the immune response\u2014strongly limiting potentially protective recalled T cell responses, and non-productively decreasing the polyclonality of the antibody response, resulting in reduced recruitment of effector mechanisms reliant on avid interactions with antibody opsonized cells or virus. Because these effector mechanisms have a demonstrated importance in preventing acquisition, decreasing viral burden, and delaying progression [72], the possible immunologic outcome of vaccines with reduced epitopic coverage may be dividing rather than conquering.",

Because improved antigenicity does not equate to improved immunogenicity, immunization studies would be required to evaluate their ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Differences in glycosylation can also have a large impact on antigenicity [17], a factor that has not been optimized in our study. Importantly, while yeast utilize the same glycosylation motif, the composition of the glycan incorporated differs significantly, and could be engineered. We rather consider the methodology described here and gp140 variants as an enabling platform for future investigations towards development of improved immunogens.

Interestingly, three of the nine mutations (H66Q, W112R and I424N) may form novel hydrogen bonds. The predominantly buried locations of the mutations identified and the predicted presence of additional, buried hydrogen bonds in selected clones suggest that the poor surface display level and limited binding of yeast-displayed gp140 to conformational Abs observed initially were related to poor folding of gp140 in S. cerevisiae, and that improved gp120 core packing and hydrogen bonding within the core may have helped to stabilize the protein, enhancing folding and resulting in higher display levels. In fact, the display level of proteins fused to Aga2p was shown previously to correlate with their thermal stability and soluble expression levels [77], and yeast is known to contain a chaperone machinery that can retain and degrade misfolded protein [78]. Further, the accumulation of mutations within the V1/V2 loop domain suggest that this region, in addition to the gp120 core itself, had a critical impact on obstructing proper folding of gp120. This finding is further supported by the notion that yeast produced gp120 core lacking this domain binds well to CD4bs conformational Abs, while full-length gp120 containing V1/V2 did not. The more hydrophilic gp41 fusion peptide has provided a critical handle to rationally improve expression of d-SOSIP gp140 in S. cerevisiae, however no additional expression enhancing or apparently structurally stabilizing gp41 mutations were identified in the evolved d-SOSIP gp140 variants. Evidence as to the utility of these rational mutations can be found in the absence of reversions observed among selected clones.",

To address this, in future studies, a secretion-capture-based display system could be developed [79], allowing for the evolution of trimeric gp140 spike protein libraries that are non-covalently linked to Aga2.

The shuffling of accumulated mutations and backcrossing to wild type greatly boosted binding to the target HIV mAbs and potentially eliminated deleterious mutations. Variants with further improved binding to certain HIV bnAbs or their germline precursors, following the concept of B-cell-lineage immunogen design [80,81] may be evolved relatively quickly using the approach described here. Glyco-engineered yeast strains [82] could serve as hosts for future yeast-based display systems to select spike protein variants homogeneously decorated with human-like glycan that is involved in binding of many bnAb-classes such as pg9/16[24] or pgt121\u2013123 [56].

Plasmids pCHA-d-SOSIP and pCHA-JRFL-gp120 for S. cerevisiae cell surface display were prepared by amplification of gp140 or gp120 from pRS-d-SOSIP using primers gp120co-for and gp140co-rev or gp120co-rev and insertion of PCR products between NheI and BamHI sites of pCHA, resulting in an orientation of HA tag, d-SOSIP, c-myc tag, followed by Aga2p from the N to C termini, respectively. pRS-d-SOSIP-D368R was prepared using primers JRFLD368R-for and JRFLD368R-rev, following the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis procedure (Agilent). PCR primers are listed in S1 Table.",

Routinely, cells were gated using forward- and side scatters and median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) were determined from 10,000 scatter-gated events that were then gated for display signal. The gate for display level was set using a non-displaying control sample, assuring that non-displaying cells are excluded. MFI values associated with antibody binding were then normalized to display level by division with the MFI associated with expression tag (nMFIs).
