Some factors responsible for the presence of etiological agents at this interface include ecological changes such as spatial and temporal land-use alterations, pathogen adaptations to new hosts, and the introduction of non-native, permissive species [5\u20138]. Of all the factors influencing disease emergence, likely the most substantial is the loss of ecological species barriers, permitting opportunistic pathogens access to wildlife [9\u201313].",

As an example, avian influenza is a biosecurity threat to the poultry industry due to its spillover from waterfowl reservoirs and subsequent viral spill back from domestic chickens (Gallus gallus) [16, 17]. What remains largely unstudied, however, is the spillover of live vaccines from domesticated species into wildlife. For the purpose of this paper we define \u201cspillover or spillover of live vaccines\u201d as the unintended transmission of live poultry vaccine viruses from domestic, gallinaceous poultry into non-target birds. Inadequate recognition of spillover events may be due to a lack of surveillance efforts, low mortality of infected animals, migration, or undetected resident wild bird morbidity [18\u201320]. The continuous expansion of the poultry industry, coupled with the mass employment of live virus vaccines, increases the probability of spillover of vaccines [21\u201323].",

Poultry producers routinely employ multiple live vaccines against economically significant pathogens, such as Marek\u2019s disease virus, Infectious bursal disease virus, Infectious bronchitis virus, Infectious laryngotracheitis virus, and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [24\u201327]. Circulating live vaccine viruses present additional risks such as reversion of virulence and recombination with wild-type strains. In addition, the immune response of wild birds induced by infection with vaccine strains may provide selective pressures resulting in viral antigenic drift or increased virulence [23, 28\u201331].",

For example, producers in California experienced Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks in 1971 and again in 2002, each costing millions of dollars to eradicate and requiring the depopulation of millions of birds [35, 36].",

Second, to expand upon those results, we also sequenced NDV wild bird isolates from Ukraine, Bulgaria and Brazil. Third, we performed active NDV surveillance in a wild Rock Pigeon (Columba livia) population within an urban environment (Atlanta, GA, USA) to assess the presence of Newcastle disease viruses.

Each bird was placed into one of two age classes: hatch-year birds (HY) who were born during the current breeding cycle or after hatch-year birds (AHY) born prior to 2012 [52]. Breeding status was established using reproductive characteristics, such as the presence of a brood patch, cloacal protuberance, or both [53]. The sex of AHY birds was determined by reproductive characteristics (if present) and, when observed, by courtship behaviors [54]. Individual body conditions were assessed using two different criteria: the ratio of bird mass to wing chord length (also known as the wing-loading aspect), and the relative amount of visible fat. The weight-to-wing chord ratio was calculated as the body mass divided by the length of the un-flattened longest primary feather [53, 55], while the MAPS (Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survival) protocol [56] was used for fat scoring. Only wing-pit fat was assessed due to the density of plumage at the furculum and stomach, and scored on an eight-point scale of 0 to 7. A zero fat score indicated no visible yellow subcutaneous fat at the wing-pit and a score of seven indicated a bulging pocket of fat.",

Fisher\u2019s Exact Test for small sample sizes and dichotomous variables [76] (a 2 x 2 contingency table) was used to examine whether a significant relationship existed among the ages at which NDV infected Rock Pigeons were found shedding virus. For that purpose, the covariates age and shedding status were each divided into two classes, the hatch-year (HY) and after hatch-year (AHY), and shedding or not shedding, respectively. We next investigated whether a measurable physiological cost was present in the wild Rock Pigeons infected with vaccine-derived NDV. We used two widely accepted and correlated measures of body condition indices in passerines and near passerines to do so: i) weight-to-wing chord ratio, which is measured on a continuous range, and ii) fat scores, which are measured along an ordinal scale [77]. Prior to analyses, the distributions for fat and weight-to-wing chord ratio were inspected to confirm that each variable met the assumption for a non-skewed distribution using the Shapiro Wilk\u2019s test statistic [78].",

While the variable weight-to-wing chord ratio had a normal distribution (S4 Table), it was necessary to relax assumptions regarding the within-group variances due to the unequal sample sizes of shedding Rock Pigeons versus non-shedding Rock Pigeons [80].

Within genotype II, 28 isolates from wild birds originating from Argentina, Bulgaria, China, India, Mexico and Ukraine clustered in a monophyletic branch with the vaccine strain chicken/USA/LaSota/1946. The mean genetic distance between this vaccine strain and the isolates within the branch was considerably low (0.2%). Within the same genotype, another 19 wild bird isolates from Brazil, China and USA grouped together with vaccine strains chicken/USA/HitchnerB1/1947 and turkey/USA/VG/GA/1989. The genetic analysis showed that the latter isolates of wild-bird origin displayed genetic distance of 0.3\u20130.4% when compared to these two vaccine strains. Similarly, seven wild-bird NDV isolates of genotype I of class II also showed close phylogenetic relationship with vaccine strains. Five Mexican isolates of wild-bird origin from 2009 clustered with the vaccine strain PHY-LMV42/1966, while two 2009 and 2011 Chinese isolates of duck origin grouped closely together in the phylogram with the vaccine strain chicken/Australia/Queensland/V-4/1966 (Fig 1). The mean genetic distance between the viruses and the vaccine strains within each of these genotype I branches was 0.2%. Pairwise distance and pairwise distance per decade results among viruses within of the described groups are presented in S7, S8 and S9 Tables. Based on the above results and the pairwise distances per decade (from 0.009% to 0.093%), the 54 viruses from these groups were determined as \u201cvaccine-derived\u201d.",

Although our data do not allow for the identification of the direct sources of NDV infection for the studied wild birds, it is reasonable to suggest that these wild bird isolates originated from recent spillovers of live NDV vaccines, instead of representing strains that naturally circulate in these birds for the following reasons: i) if the newly isolated viruses had been naturally circulating and originated from vaccine strains (originally isolated in the 1940s and the 1960s) through natural evolution they would have changed significantly for the last 4 to 6 decades and would have presented much higher nucleotide distances than the ones determined in the pairwise distance analysis (S7, S8 and S9 Tables); ii) preservation of live NDV in the environment, unchanged for such a long period of time, is highly unlikely due to the thermal and biological lability of NDV [83]; and iii) for the majority of the isolates studied here that are almost genetically identical, there is no evidence of a direct epidemiological link, neither geographical nor temporal, between their isolations.",

Newcastle disease vaccines, although often ignored, may behave similarly to more widely studied vaccines. There are multiple live vaccines that are widely used in human and animal medicine that are documented as being shed from inoculated patients (varicella, vaccinia, polio, distemper) into the environment [88\u201391].

Furthermore, the synanthropic nature of many birds from the order Columbiformes, as well as their worldwide distribution [95\u201397] and presence in anthropogenic affected areas, increase the probability for cross-host transmission of NDV between poultry and wild birds. The hatch-year cohort of Rock Pigeons (Atlanta, GA, USA) represented 100% of all incidences of identification of vaccine-derived viruses within that population. This may be associated with the higher vulnerability to disease of juveniles due to their increased movement requirements for foraging, in concert with na\u00efve immune systems [98, 99]. In the studied dataset, the order Anseriformes also had a high incidence of shedding of vaccine-derived NDV. The high rate of detection of vaccine-derived NDV from this order in Asia may reflect a higher degree of contact between wild birds and domestic members of this order as a result of the larger populations of ducks and geese used as poultry in this continent.",

Molecular epidemiology meta-analyses with access to convenience datasets comprised of GenBank genomic-associated data are widespread and useful tools. For example, a limited dataset of self-reported isolates from GenBank (n = 97) was used to pinpoint the source and direction of spread for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus within hospitals of Florida [107]. Sequences from convenience samples of Leishmania infantum from Brazil (n = 45) submitted to GenBank were evaluated to determine that no statistical association existed between the host species (canids or humans) and genetic variability within the causative agent [108]. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) within densely populated Hong Kong prompted a study in which the only available dataset was a series of convenience samples of GenBank isolates from recently acquired clinical cases from China (n = 168). The authors not only identified two co-circulating SARS viral clusters, but also identified the host travel method for the viral isolate detected in North America [109].",

The analysis of 54 isolates is a small sample size from which to draw inferences about the potential impact of spillovers of NDV vaccines; however, the referenced studies did not indicate that vaccine viruses were specifically targeted for sampling as opposed to wild-type NDV, and it was concluded that each vaccine-derived virus was an incidental research discovery. We utilized a convenience sample to make a causal inference. In public health and epidemiology, causal inference and risk management often use the best available data to identify when intervention is feasible and necessary [110].",

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on Tamura 3-parameter model with 500 bootstrap replicates [70]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-108983.3717) is shown. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4 categories (+G, parameter = 0.0936). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 39.7777% sites). The tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site and the percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together are shown below the branches. The analysis involved 81 nucleotide sequences with a total of 1662 positions in the final dataset. Isolates studied in this work are designated in front of the taxa name as follows: USA\u2014\u25cf; Ukraine\u2014\u25cb; Brazil\u2014\u25a1, Bulgaria\u2014\u25a0. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [67]. The Roman numerals presented in the taxa names in the phylogenetic trees represent the respective genotype for each isolate, followed by the GenBank identification number, host name (if available), country of isolation, strain designation and country of isolation.",
