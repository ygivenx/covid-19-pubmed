Species classification was initially based on the susceptibility of strains to capsid binding antivirals [5], [6] and subsequently confirmed by phylogenetic studies [4], [7]. HRVs are also subdivided by receptor usage; major group HRVs use an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1; n = 88 strains), which interacts within a depression of the viral surface known as the canyon [8]. Minor group HRVs (n = 12) receive a molecule from the low density lipoprotein receptor family (LDLR) at protrusions along the 5-fold axis of the capsid surface [9]\u2013[12]. Recently, heparan sulphate was identified as a pH dependent, low efficiency receptor for HRV-54 [13]. A relationship between receptor usage and species identity is only evident among minor group HRVs; all are HRV As. Major group HRVs reside in both species. Studies have identified four neutralizing immunogenic sites on the surface of a major group HRV (HRV-14; NImIA, NImIB, NImII and NImIII)[14] and three sites on a minor group HRV (HRV-2; site A, B and C) [15], with some overlap [16]. These sites consist of discontinuous amino acid sequence within VP1, VP2 and VP3.",

The initial strain described, HRV-QPM, was identified from children with presenting symptoms often suggesting bronchiolitis [31]. Subsequently, \u2018HRV-Xs\u2019 were found in an adult asthma study in the United States [32] and \u2018HRV-Cs\u2019 were described from a study of pediatric infection by human bocavirus in Hong Kong [33]. Some notable features associated with these six putative viruses include the reliance upon molecular methods for their detection, their apparent endeminicity, their failure to produce cytopathic effects in culture, their frequent detection in subjects with expiratory wheezing and their limited sequence identity with existing HRV strains but high shared sequence identity. Studies employing subgenomic sequences proposed that there were many of these putative viruses occupying a distinct position within the genus Rhinovirus, which we collectively called HRV A2 [34]. It has been proposed that these strains may constitute a new picornavirus species [33]. Data have not yet been presented which appropriately address classification using current ICTV criteria and the scope of the clinical impact of these divergent strains has not yet been studied in detail. Because it appears that the members of this clade are frequently associated with LRT illness we sought to better characterise them in the hope of finding features that might prove useful in predicting the outcome of HRV A2 infection.",

However, the inability to isolate the HRV A2 strains in vitro will hinder crystallography studies seeking to identify structural features, so we created structure-based alignments of the VP1\u20134 sequences from the prototype HRV A2 strain, HRV-QPM and used them to predict the presence of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets. These were identified in the eight, anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet \u2018jellyroll\u2019 conformation common among picornavirus proteins VP1, VP2 (including the EF \u2018puff\u2019) and VP3 [39] (Figure 2). Deletions in the VP1 protein imparted the most dramatic changes, reducing the protrusion of the BC, DE and HI loops compared with the other HRVs and introducing an additional C-terminal sheet-loop-sheet structure (arrow, Figure 2B). Similar deletions were noted in all HRV A2 strains but only HRV-C026 was predicted to encode a similar, C-terminal structure in VP1. We next assembled the HRV-QPM structural proteins into a protomer by associating them with the closest sequence match (HRV-16) and then replicated this structure in silico into a viral pentamer. RMSD values were derived from the VP1, VP2 and VP3 structures of all HRVs with crystallography-derived data available (HRV-1A, -2, -3, -14 and -16) and compared to the predicted HRV-QPM structure. HRV-QPM and HRV-16 shared the highest conformational similarity (0.145, 0.142 and 0.147 \u00c5 for the VP1, VP2 and VP3 structures respectively), reflecting the use of HRV-16 in predicting the structure HRV-QPM. The poorest agreements were between HRV-1A and HRV-3 in VP1 (0.793 \u00c5) and VP3 (0.740 \u00c5) and between HRV-2 and HRV-14 in VP2 (0.697 \u00c5). At the ICAM-1 footprint, HRV-QPM values ranged from 0.064\u20130.106 \u00c5 and 0.709\u20130.779 \u00c5 in comparison to the same regions on HRV-16 and -14, respectively. Values could not be determined for HRV-2 because of the impact of deletions. We also examined the conformational agreement between an HEV footprint e.g. the CAR site employed by CV-B3, and the predicted HRV-QPM structure. A space filling model of the pentamer was next used to display SimPlot data in order to visualise regions of sequence conservation and diversification with a focus on the major (ICAM-1; Figure 3A) and minor (VLDL-R; Figure 3C) group domains. Overall, greater sequence identity was apparent between HRV-2 than HRV-14 reflecting the genomic similarity to HRV A strains, however within the domains defining HRV groups, HRV-QPM was most similar in its antigenic sites to the major group representative, HRV-14. Most sequence diversity was found in the VP2 protein while the most conserved protein in these comparisons was VP3.",

Thirdly, HRV- and HEV-like protease cleavage sites and locations suggested similar proteolytic processing (Figure 1A).

The comparative reduction in size of protrusions along the 5-fold axis, resulting from deletions in the BC, DE and HI loops of the HRV-QPM VP1, together with structure-altering deletions and substitutions affecting some antigenic sites previously identified from a minor group strain (HRV-2), particularly site A, lead us to propose that HRV A2 viruses are unlikely to behave as members of the minor group. Mapping the known ICAM-1 contact sites onto the predicted HRV-QPM structure revealed that most of the footprint was retained in structure by HRV-QPM, although it differed in sequence compared to other major group strains. SimPlot data revealed that sequence variation was not uncommon among strains within the major groups. Two small \u03b1-helices predicted to form in the HRV-QPM VP1 and VP3 footprints may disrupt receptor binding but since ICAM-1 is predicted to attach at differing angles in different HRV strains [8], it may be suitably flexible to overcome such obstacles. Although NImIA and NImIB, first identified in a major group virus (HRV-14), were affected by the deletions in VP1, additional support for HRV-QPM belonging to the major HRV group came from structural similarities in the NImII (VP2) and NImIII (VP3). Amino acid substitutions occurred at these sites (E\u2192G and G\u2192T respectively) rather than insertions or deletions. These variations may result in distinct immunogenicity.",

The high detection frequency of HRV A2 strains from patients with acute LRT illness may be another indication that these divergent viruses employ a tissue-specific receptor or it may be that all HRV strains cause similar illness, they simply have not been subjected to sufficient individual study. The LDLR family of molecules are located on many tissues in many species [10] and yet all these locations do not, to our knowledge, host HRV replication. Identifying an HRV A2 receptor in vitro cell culture system will be important for empirically addressing receptor- and replication-related issues and the outcomes may have broad implications for what is currently known of the attachment, entry and replication of HRV strains. Based on our predictive in silico studies of HRV-QPM, an ICAM-like molecule may be an early candidate for the role of receptor.",

The sequence of most HRV genomes is unknown and our understanding of HRV structure is mostly due to crystallography data derived from less than 5% of HRV strains. There are limited structural data to support the wholesale extrapolation of receptor binding behaviour and capsid structure to the other HRV strains. Without data to the contrary, in silico analyses appear to provide a suitable surrogate to address this issue. By employing RMSD calculations to examine the conformational similarity between predicted HRV-QPM structures and those from HRV structures determined empirically, we could be confident that our predictions approximated experimental data.

In our experience (data not shown), the earliest PCR-based methods [50] are already efficient at detecting these divergent strains. By extrapolating from published subgenomic sequence data, this clade is populated by a great number of divergent strains which are distributed both geographically and temporally, suggesting an endemic aspect to these previously uncharacterised viruses. No evidence exists to suggest that the HRV A2 strains are emerging viruses, rather it appears that they are newly identified strains that have been contributing to respiratory illness, in the absence of detection using culture-based diagnostic methods, for many years. There has now arisen a need for reliable protocols to characterise these putative viruses but in the absence of an HRV A2 isolate, neutralization, acid sensitivity and antiviral susceptibility studies, important for taxonomic placement, cannot be obtained. We have catalogued a series of features using methods which, while requiring further validation, contribute to our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of HRV A2 strains. Additional molecular approaches will also be useful to classify other recently described divergent HRV strains [51]. Our data demonstrated that the newly identified HRVs, residing within the HRV A2 clade, do not satisfy the criteria for assignment to any existing HRV or HEV species and most likely constitute one or more novel species in the current genus Rhinovirus, tentatively called Human rhinovirus C (HRV C).",

Improved diagnostic methods, the broader application of existing PCR technology, new sequence data and many new insights have greatly enhanced our understanding of human rhinoviruses and the selective pressures impacting on their evolution [25], [26]. Similarly, the identification of a putative new HRV species, HRV C, the characterisation of HRV-QPM's molecular features and epidemiology and the identification of similar viruses around the world [31], [34], [52] have potential to reinvigorate HRV research. We found that the variants of one strain of the HRV Cs, HRV-QPM, sought in a well characterised population of specimens collected over all months of a single year, were more often associated with LRT illness than is commonly reported. The illness frequently presented as exacerbation of expiratory wheezing or persistent cough, with a requirement for supplemental oxygen, steroids and bronchodilator treatments. Despite exhaustive PCR-based investigation for other respiratory viral causes in our previous retrospective studies [31], [41], HRV-QPM detection, in the absence of any other pathogen, occurred among infants with mild, moderate and severe (in both instances) LRT illness and most cases (88.2%) were admitted to hospital. Associated illness was usually (92.3% of the time) scored as mild to moderate and 58.8% of the HRV-QPM positive cases were children aged 12 months or less. The same age group represented 43.2% of the total study population originally screened for HRV-QPM (n = 1,244). While it is to be expected that a paediatric hospital-based population would overestimate the severity of HRV C clinical impact compared to a community-based study, our study may in fact better represent the impact of first infection with HRV strains, the major pathogens detected during the first year of life [53].",

Of the five HRV strains with empirically determined structural data available, HRV-14 [14] and -16 [49] shared the highest sequence identities with HRV-QPM in the regions chosen. Proteins VP1 to VP3 were aligned and threaded through HRV-16 (1ayn1, 1ayn2, 1ayn3 respectively) and VP4 through HRV-14 (1na1). Models were submitted to the SWISS-MODEL server for final threading analysis. The resulting HRV-QPM protein data bank files (PDB) were then matched and structurally aligned to a template HRV protomer (HRV-16, 1AYN). Other picornavirus reference PDB files used in this study: HRV-2 (1FBN), HRV-3 (1RHI), HRV-14 (4RHV), CV-A21 (1Z7S), E-11 (1H8T), PV-1 (1HXS) and CV-B3 (1COV). Structural matching, alignments, ribbon figures, capsid predictions and root mean square deviation (RMSD) data were produced using Chimera [55].",
