            "text": "The disease can be distinguished from Muscovy duck reovirus (MDRV) infections by clinical presentation of hemorrhagic and necrotic lesions in the liver and spleen and 5\u201350% mortality rates. Furthermore, the existing commercial vaccines against ARVs or MDRVs fail to prevent NDRV infection and transmission. A reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) provides a rapid and precise detection assay for viral pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity4. This technique is profitable and convenient, only requires a constant temperature water bath and averts some deficiencies, including high necessity for equipment, tremendous cost, lengthened examination period and low sensitivity5. In comparison with the equipment required for traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays, RT-LAMP is easy to conduct in resource-limited laboratory settings in underdeveloped countries6. RT-LAMP has been widely exploited in clinical diagnosis of various viral pathogens including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), H10N8 subtype of influenza A virus, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotypes 1\u20134, Japanese encephalitis virus (DENV1\u20134) and West Nile virus (WNV)7\u201310. The ARV structural and molecular compositions are generally similar to those of mammalian reovirus (MRV). However, some of the ARV biological properties differ from mammalian reovirus, which have been shown elsewhere11,12. The S3 segment encoding the \u03c3B protein of duck and MRVs is structurally similar to ARV \u03c3B gene13. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on both sigma C (\u03c3C) and sigma B (\u03c3B)-encoding genes followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were employed to characterize Tunisian ARV isolates14. Furthermore, the highly variable sequences of the S3 and M3 have been reported to differentiate between novel duck reovirus (NDR), MDRV and avian reovirus15. Thus, a simple, rapid and sensitive diagnostic technique for detection of NDRV is required. The potential application of RT-LAMP assay using the S3 gene of NDRV-NPO3 strain for specific diagnosis of NDRV infection with limited sensitivity and without its utilization in the detection of NDRV in naturally- and experimentally-infected ducks have been reported16. In this study, we developed and evaluated a RT-LAMP assay targeting the gene encoding the \u03c3B major outer-capsid protein to detect NDRV in naturally suspected NDRV-infected ducks and experimentally infected ducklings with NDRV.",

RT-LAMP was performed under different reaction temperatures from 59 \u00b0C to 65 \u00b0C. The results showed that RT-LAMP at 65 \u00b0C produced very clear and bright bands. Therefore, 65 \u00b0C was selected as the optimal temperature of NDRV RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction time indicated that 50 min was adequate for reaction completion. The ratio of calcein and manganese ion (1:8\u20131:128) was analyzed and the color was obvious at the ratio of 1:12. Consequently, the ratio of 1:12 was selected as the optimal ratio to use in proceeding experiments. The effect of Mg2+ ion concentration was analyzed. Magnesium sulfate (Mg2+) was added at a concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 mM reaction mixtures containing positive sample. Upon gel analysis, bands were obvious at 3 mM Mg2+. When the concentration was greater than 3.0 mM (lane 4~7), the reaction efficiency decreased but tended to be stable. Therefore, 3.0 mM was chosen as the best reaction concentration for NDRV RT-LAMP. Moderately various yields were detected with the different amounts of betaine employed and a concentration of 0.5 mM was found to be proper for a more distinct pattern. The size of the ladder increased as the concentration of dNTPs increased and a concentration greater 0.3 mM was found to be sufficient. AMV reverse transcriptase concentration of 0.14 U/\u00b5L was found to be appropriate for the amplification efficiency of NDRV RT-LAMP reaction. The reaction efficiency decreased as the concentration of the AMV enzyme concentration increased.

In China, NDRV causes tremendous economic losses to the duck industry and most of the affected ducks, particularly ducklings died within 72 hpi. Therefore, it is crucially required to develop an easy, rapid, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method for NDRV detection. In this study, we employed RT-LAMP to identify NDVR as a serious pathogen for duck industry in Guangdong province, China. Specificity of the RT-LAMP primers was investigated exploiting Muscovy Duck Reovirus (MDRV), Avian Reovirus (ARV), Duck Disease Virus (DPV), Duck Hepatitis Virus (DHAV), Duck Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), H9 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV), H5 subtype AIV and duck Tanzuru virus (DTMUV). The utilization of the six specific primers that recognize distinct regions on the gene encoding the \u03c3B major outer-capsid protein of NDRV assured high specificity of the template nucleic acid amplification. Our data showed that there was no cross-reaction between NDVR and other examined viruses. The RT-LAMP specificity detection of NDRV was in accord with other studies about specificity of RT-LAMP reaction in viral detection7\u201310,19.
