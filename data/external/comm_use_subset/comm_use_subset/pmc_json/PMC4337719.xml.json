A number of gene expression studies conducted in postmortem lung tissue samples from patients with CTEPH have indicated that aberrant processing of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcriptome in CTEPH may provide a mechanistic convergence between the diverse genetic heritability of this disease and the disruption of fundamental signaling pathways, resulting in the common CTEPH phenotype. Studies conducted in pulmonary endothelial cells have identified differentially expressed genes, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH (3,4). However, gene expression regulation is a complex process, which involves an interplay between DNA sequence variation, chromatin and epigenetic modifications, protein transcription factors and regulatory noncoding RNAs.",

To the best of our knowledge, only a single study conducted in the tissues of CTEPH patients has demonstrated that miRNA-759 may influence the susceptibility to the development of CTEPH (6). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), a novel class of regulatory RNAs, have been shown to be involved in certain fundamental events in gene regulation.

Numerous lncRNAs have been identified through large-scale analyses of full-length cDNA sequences in humans, mice and flies. lncRNA molecules have been shown to play an important role in the control of imprinting, cell differentiation, immune response, pathogenesis of various human diseases, tumorigenesis and other biological processes (11\u201315).

Pulmonary angiography and right heart catheterization were used in the diagnosis of CTEPH and determination of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics (16). Mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg during exercise was considered to indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and the six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were hemodynamic variables applied to assess the cardiopulmonary function and prognosis of the CTEPH patients. At inclusion, all the patients received oral anticoagulants for a minimum of 6 months and underwent PEA in accordance with the guidelines of the Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital (Beijing, China).

Thus, a concerted effort to genetically characterize CTEPH may provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and development of the disease, as well as help identify novel personalized treatments. A number of studies have demonstrated that the expression levels of lncRNAs are dysregulated in numerous human diseases, including lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (35\u201337,38).

The silencing or reduced expression of particular lncRNAs has been previously demonstrated to result in a concomitant reduction in the expression of nearby protein-coding genes, including numerous proteins which are known to govern the regulation of cellular differentiation. In addition, the lncRNAs and nearby coding genes may share upstream regulation or local transcriptional effects (29,31,40\u201342). Certain lncRNAs have been reported to increase gene expression. For instance, Evf-2 ncRNA forms a complex with the homeodomain-containing protein Dlx2, which leads to transcriptional enhancement (43). In addition, heat-shock RNA-1 ncRNA binding to heat-shock transcription factor 1 has been found to result in the induction of heat-shock proteins (44). Furthermore, an isoform of the ncRNA steroid receptor RNA activator is known to be associated with steroid receptor responsiveness (45). Finally, \u00d8rom et al (46) recently identified that noncoding RNA-activators 1\u20137 can enhance the expression of nearby genes. Thus, analyzing the genes nearby to lncRNAs may assist in understanding the involvement of lncRNAs in CTEPH. The majority of lncRNAs have a distinct spatial and temporal specificity in the process of organismal differentiation and development (47). A previous study, which investigated 1,300 lncRNAs in mice, demonstrated that in particular areas of the brain, there are different expression patterns of lncRNAs (48). These lncRNA expression signatures have been detected in prostate carcinoma and hepatic tumors (49). Thus, differential expression patterns of lncRNAs may be present in the pulmonary artery tissues of CTEPH patients, and lncRNAs that are differentially expressed may result in alterations in cellular function, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of CTEPH. In the present study, 464 pairs of differentially expressed enhancer-like lncRNAs and mRNAs, of which 95.3% (442/464) were regulated in the same direction (up or down). Therefore, the present study hypothesized that a number of these lncRNAs enhance the activation of nearby genes.",

            "text": "Molecular networks are useful in the investigation of biological processes and can be constructed using results obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments (50) or from algorithmic predictions based on gene function correlation and expression profiles (51). Network models based on algorithmic predictions from high throughput gene expression tests may be used to construct images of the networks regulating gene expression and metabolic pathways in the groups analyzed. The networks intrinsic to the CTEPH phenotype are hypothesized to be involved in the normal functioning of the pulmonary artery endothelium. Based on the information obtained regarding the expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Pairs found to have a significant correlation were selected and used to construct a network. These results demonstrated an association between lncRNAs and mRNAs, indicating that lncRNAs may regulate specific mRNAs, or vice versa. mRNAs are likely to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH, while lncRNAs function through the epigenetic modification of mRNAs.",

This gene encodes a member of the natural killer cell receptor C-type lectin family. The natural killer cell has been found to be involved in vascular remodeling, which may lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension (52,53). NR_027783 is a 1,199 bp transcript variant 2 from Homo sapiens spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1). The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the acetyltransferase family and a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine metabolism. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the polyamine regulatory pathway is a pharmacological target in pulmonary arterial hypertension (54,55). NR_033766 is a 6,384 bp transcript variant 7 from Homo sapiens forkhead box P2 (FOXP2). The FOXP2 gene is involved in the normal development of the areas of the brain controlling speech and language during embryogenesis. In addition, FOXP2 may be associated with a number of biological pathways and cascades, which also influence the development of language. Mutations in this gene result in speech-language disorder 1 (SPCH1), also termed as autosomal dominant speech and language disorder with orofacial dyspraxia. NR_001284 is a 2,783 bp pseudogene, Homo sapiens tenascin XA, the biological function of which remains unclear.",

Peng et al (56) performed a functional enrichment analysis on protein-coding genes nearby to differentially expressed lncRNAs in SARS-CoV infected mice. The authors identified that the most significant functional group consisted of annotation terms associated with gene expression, including transcription regulation, nuclear and DNA-binding transcription factor activity, as well as the regulation of RNA metabolism. In the present study, GO functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs with their coexpressed differentially expressed lncRNA partners, demonstrated that these genes were functionally associated with immune response, inflammatory response, response of wounding and response to endogenous stimulus. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that antigen processing and presentation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and leukocyte transendothelial migration may be involved in the development of CTEPH. Although the function of lncRNAs in CTEPH still requires further investigation, the present study hypothesized that the formation of CTEPH may be caused by certain lncRNAs.",
