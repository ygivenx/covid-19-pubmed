PS receptors do not interact with the viral glycoprotein (GP), but bind to PS on the surface of the virion lipid membrane, causing internalization of viral particles into the endosomal compartment [9, 15]. This mechanism of viral entry has been termed apoptotic mimicry [16].

TIM family members, encoded by the Havcr family of genes, contribute to the uptake of apoptotic bodies to clear dying cells from tissues and the circulation [22\u201324]. TIM proteins are type 1, cell surface glycoproteins. Three family members are present in humans (hTIM-1, hTIM-3 and hTIM-4) and four in mice (TIM-1, TIM-2, TIM-3 and TIM-4) [25]. hTIM-1 was identified through a bioinformatics-based screen to be important for filovirus entry [8]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that hTIM-1 and hTIM-4, but not hTIM-3, enhance entry of a broad range of viruses including members of the alphavirus, arenavirus, baculovirus, filovirus, and flavivirus families [9, 15, 26\u201329].

The amino terminal IgV domain binds to PS on the outer leaflet of the viral membrane through a IgV domain binding pocket that is conserved across the TIM family of receptors [9, 26, 27, 29]. We have reported that the ability of PS on Ebola virus like particles and EBOV glycoprotein pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus to bind to TIM-1 is equivalent, suggesting similar levels of PS present on the surface of these virions [15]. Aspartic acid and asparagine residues within the IgV binding pocket are essential for virion binding [9, 15, 27]; these same TIM residues are required for apoptotic body binding and uptake [30]. The IgV domain is extended from the plasma membrane by a mucin like domain (MLD) that is anchored to the cell surface with by a transmembrane domain connected to a short intracellular cytoplasmic tail. The length, but not the specific sequence, of the MLD is required for TIMs to serve as enveloped virus receptors [29]. Surprisingly, neither the TIM transmembrane domain nor cytoplasmic tail is required as a GPI-anchored TIM-1 construct is completely functional as a viral receptor [26, 29]. These findings indicate that the TIM-1 cytoplasmic tail, which contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site that initiates signaling events [31\u201333], is not essential for TIM-1-mediated virus uptake.",

With the wide variety of cell surface receptors able to mediate filovirus uptake into endosomes, it is possible that sufficient receptor redundancy exists in vivo, such that the loss of any one of the PS receptors may have little or no effect on EBOV viremia, tissue virus load or pathological consequence. Alternatively, specific cell surface receptors, such as TIM-1, might be critical for in vivo infection and pathogenesis.",

A recent study demonstrated that TIM-1-deficient mice have lower morbidity and mortality than wild-type mice when challenged intravascularly (i.v.) with mouse-adapted EBOV (maEBOV) [38]. This study highlighted the role of TIM-1 in non-permissive T lymphocytes, reporting that EBOV interaction with TIM-1 on CD4+ T cells enhanced proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation in purified CD4+ T cells. The authors conclude that an enhanced TIM-1-dependent cytokine storm in T cells significantly contributes to EBOV pathogenesis. However, the impact of TIM-1 on viremia in mice was examined in the plasma at a single time point during infection, leaving open the possibility that TIM-1 may also serve as an important receptor for EBOV entry in vivo.",

            "text": "Here, we examined the in vivo importance of TIM-1 for virus replication and pathogenesis using a highly tractable BSL2 model virus of EBOV. Our BSL2 virus model is recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding either full length EBOV glycoprotein or mucin domain deleted EBOV glycoprotein in place of the native VSV G protein (EBOV GP/rVSV or EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV). Our use of these viruses allowed us to conduct detailed studies focused, on the role of TIM-1 virus entry, host responses, and pathogenesis. As reported for maEBOV, we observed that both EBOV GP/rVSV and EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV were less pathogenic in TIM-1-deficient mice compared to TIM-1-sufficient mice. The impact of the loss of TIM-1 was specific for EBOV GP-expressing viruses since wild-type VSV was equally virulent in TIM-1-deficient and TIM-1-sufficient mice over a wide range of challenge doses. Importantly, reduced mortality observed in the EBOV GP encoding virus-infected TIM-1-/- mice was associated at late times during infection with lower viremia and virus loads in multiple tissues previously appreciated to be important in EBOV pathogenesis. Consistent with reduced overall virus loads, proinflammatory chemokine profiles were lower in the infected TIM-1-deficient mice at late times during infection. Finally, to directly evaluate whether we observed enhanced pathogenesis in TIM-1-sufficient mice associated with T cell activation as previously reported [38], we depleted the T cell compartment of TIM-1-sufficient or -deficient mice and challenge them with EBOV GP/rVSV. T cell-depleted, TIM-1-sufficient mice succumbed to EBOV GP/rVSV more readily than T cell-depleted, TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that in our model system a TIM-1-dependent T cell cytokine storm was not responsible for virus pathogenesis. In total, our studies provide evidence that TIM-1-associated pathogenesis correlated with enhanced virus load at late times during infection, consistent with TIM-1 having an important role as a receptor for EBOV in vivo.",

However, the relevance of TIM-1 in vivo for VSV infection has not been examined. Further, WT VSV serves as an excellent control for in vivo studies with EBOV GP-bearing viruses. We challenged TIM-1-/- and control mice with 105 iu of VSV by i.v. injection. In contrast to our EBOV GP/rVSV findings, we observed no difference in the survival curve between the two strains of mice (Fig 1C). Since it is likely that VSV bearing it native GP is more pathogenic than a recombinant VSV containing a different viral GP, we also evaluated mortality associated with different doses of VSV and found that administration of as little as 101 iu of VSV was lethal to Ifnar-/- mice (S2 Fig). Thus, we repeated VSV infections in control and TIM-1-/- mice at a challenge dose of 101 iu to determine if subtle changes in virus pathogenesis could be discerned. Even at this low dose, there was no difference in the survival in the TIM-1-/- mice versus the control mice (Fig 1D). These results provide evidence that the difference in EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis in BALB/c Ifnar-/- and TIM-1-/- mice was due to the presence of EBOV GP expressed in the recombinant VSV rather than other VSV genes. The reduced pathogenesis of EBOV GP expressing virus in TIM-1-/- mice was consistent with findings described by Younan et al. using maEBOV [38].",

At early times during infection, no difference in viremia or virus load was observed in most organs of TIM-1-/- versus control mice. However, by day 5 of EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV infection, TIM-1-/- mice had a 100-fold reduction in viremia compared to control mice (Fig 2) and a similar trend was observed during infections with full length EBOV GP/rVSV (S3 Fig). In parallel, levels of infectious virus in liver, kidney, and adrenal gland were also significantly reduced. Studies at day 5 of infection also indicated that EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV loads were much reduced in the brain of TIM-1-/- mice and trended lower in the testis (S4A and S4B Fig), consistent with an overall reduction in virus load in the TIM-1-/- mice at late times during infection. Thus, reduced virus replication in a number of organs was associated with the survival observed in TIM-1-/- mice. These findings provide evidence that TIM-1 expression is important for the generation of high viral load in some organs at late times in infection.",

These results are consistent with previous studies that implicate spleen in early and sustained EBOV replication [47\u201349]. Lung titers were not significantly different between the control and TIM-1-/- mice at 5 days following infection. This result was somewhat unexpected as we had previously demonstrated robust hTIM-1 expression on the apical surface airway epithelial cells [8].

Therefore, we analyzed control and TIM-1-/- organs following EBOV GP\u0394O/rVSV infection for the chemokines, CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1). At least one of the two transcripts for these proinflammatory chemokines in all three organs was elevated in the control mice at both day 3 and/or 5 of infection compared to the TIM-1-/- mouse tissues (Fig 4). In combination with our survival and viral burden results, these observations suggest that the presence of TIM-1 in mice contributes to EBOV GP/rVSV pathogenesis through increased infection of cells in several organs at late times during infection and that this is associated with increased expression of proinflammatory chemokines.",

As others have suggested that TIM-1 on T cell subsets contribute to enhanced EBOV pathogenesis [38], we depleted T cells in control and TIM-1-/- mice to assess outcomes during EBOV GP/rVSV infection. Mice were intraperitoneally administered \u03b1-CD8 mAb, 2.43, and \u03b1-CD4 mAb, GK1.5, at days -1 and 2. We verified that T cells within peripheral blood were profoundly depleted at day 5 of infection by flow cytometry following immunostaining with an \u03b1-CD90 mAb (Fig 5A). As observed for the T cell-competent mice in above studies, T cell-depleted control mice challenged with EBOV GP/rVSV succumbed to infection between 4\u20136 days, whereas T cell-depleted TIM-1-/- mice had significantly better survival (Fig 5B).

Consistent with the enhanced survival of the TIM-1-deficient mice following virus challenge, we show that these mice also had reduced infectious virus in liver, kidney and adrenal gland at late times during infection. EBOV replication in these organs is well established and thought to contribute to overall EBOV load [47, 58\u201361]. The lower virus load in these organs of the TIM-1-/- mice was also reflected in a ~100-fold reduction in viremia at day 5 of infection. The reduced pathology in our TIM-1-deficient mice was EBOV GP-dependent since survival associated with G/rVSV infection was unaffected by TIM-1 expression. Thus, our studies indicate that the glycoprotein present on the virions was responsible for the TIM-1-dependent changes in virus load and mouse survival.",

A number of studies have shown at early times of infection EBOV antigens are primarily, if not exclusively, found in cells of the myeloid compartment [49, 61, 62], cells that do not express TIM-1. However, as infection progresses, additional cell types become EBOV antigen positive, suggesting a spread of virus to other cell types [50, 62]. Our data suggest that TIM-1 on some of this later group of cells contributes to virus infection and pathogenesis. Likely, late cell targets that express TIM-1 would include kidney epithelial cells [63, 64] and epithelial populations [8] in adrenal gland, eye, liver, brain and testis.",

In general, we did not observe significant differences of proinflammatory cytokines in TIM-1+ and TIM-1- mice even at late times during infection when titer differences were notable. It is certainly possible that other cytokines, not evaluated here, might be more dramatically altered. We did observe elevated levels of the proinflammatory chemokine transcripts, CCL2 and CXCL10, in the TIM-1-sufficient mice compared to the deficient mice. We postulate that the higher levels of chemokines in TIM-1+ mice may reflect the innate immune responses stimulated by the higher virus load. Alternatively, as postulated by Younan, et al., the elevated chemokine profile and associated mortality in the TIM-1+ mice might be due to a TIM-1-dependent cytokine storm elicited by T cells [38]. We tested this latter possibility by virus challenge of T cell-depleted mice. T cell depletion did not alter EBOV GP/rVSV pathology. We found significantly greater mortality associated with virus infection of TIM-1-sufficient mice which were depleted for T cells than T cell-depleted, TIM-1-deficient mice, suggesting that T cells are not responsible for the reduced survival of TIM-1-sufficient mice. Hence, our findings do not support the conclusion that TIM-1 expression on T cells plays a significant role in the pathology associated with this acute infection.",

It is possible that the levels of cytokines and chemokines observed in our studies are influenced by the genetic background of the mice. Others have looked at the effect of an Ifnar-/- background on immune responses. Studies have shown that a number of cytokines and chemokines are suppressed by the absence of type I interferon (IFN) responses in the first 24 hours of virus infection [68, 69]. However, by 24 hours of viral infection, the burst of production of these transcripts and proteins in wild-type mice is reported to subside and levels in wild-type and Ifnar-/- animals are roughly equivalent. As our studies investigate cytokine and chemokines levels at later points (days 3 and 5) during infection, the direct impact of the lack of type I IFNs may be minimal. Furthermore, not all cytokines and chemokines are suppressed in Ifnar-/- mice with expression of some of these proteins enhanced by ablation of this signaling pathway [68]. In addition, during wild-type EBOV infection, it should be noted that the EBOV type I IFN antagonists, VP24 and VP35, also rapidly suppress the type I IFN pathway [70]. Thus, our EBOV GP/rVSV studies in Ifnar-/- mice may recapitulate a number of aspects of immune suppression elicited by wild-type filoviruses.",

            "text": "Our results also demonstrate that TIM-1 is not important for WT VSV pathogenesis. Due to the wide cellular tropism of VSV, ubiquitous cell lipid components such as PS, phosphatidylinositol or the ganglioside GM3 originally were proposed as the VSV cell surface receptor [71\u201373]. However, more recent investigations have revealed that these lipids are not readily used as VSV cell surface receptors [74, 75]. Instead, the LDL receptor and its family members are proposed to serve as VSV receptors on human and mouse cells [46]. Therefore, in vivo pathogenesis induced by VSV would differ from EBOV GP/rVSV since the dependence on LDL receptors for entry is conferred by the VSV G glycoprotein [46]. Presumably the VSV membrane contains PS that can interact with TIM-1, but the affinity of VSV G for LDL receptors is likely greater than the affinity of PS in the virion envelope towards PS receptors like TIM-1. Studies from our lab have shown that only when the high affinity interactions of Lassa virus GP with its receptor, \u03b1-dystroglycan, are abrogated does TIM-1 mediate Lassa virus pseudovirion entry [76]. Future studies would be valuable to assess the ability of VSV to utilize TIM-1 as a cell surface receptor in the absence of expression of LDL receptors. A second explanation for the lack of WT VSV utilization of PS receptors, that is not mutually exclusive with the first, is that the quantity of VSV G versus EBOV glycoprotein incorporated onto the surface of VSV may be greater. While this has not been explored directly to date, if fewer EBOV glycoproteins were present on a virion, the ability of virion associated PS to interact with PS receptors might increase.",

Our studies indicate that TIM-1 expression is associated with elevated viral loads in the liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and brain since loss of TIM-1 significantly lowered viral burden in these organs. Future studies will need to explore the impact that TIM-1 expression has on EBOV infection of specific cells within these organs. By identifying TIM-1 expressing cells that serve as viral targets and understanding the contribution of these cells to the EBOV disease pathogenesis, we will be able to better develop TIM-1 specific therapeutics against EBOV infection.",
