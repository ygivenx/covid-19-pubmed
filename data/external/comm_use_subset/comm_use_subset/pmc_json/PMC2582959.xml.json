Adenovirus vectors are highly immunogenic as documented by clinical trials evaluating gene transfer efficacy and immune responses. Because they are replication-defective adenovirus vectors are also perceived to be safer for human use than a replication-competent vaccine. The most significant challenge for the adenovirus-based vaccines is the concern that a significant portion of the global population has pre-existing antibodies against the adenovirus vector which may affect efficacy [15]\u2013[17] and has performed poorly as a vaccine vector in recent clinical trials [18]\u2013[19]. In contrast, pre-existing immunity against VSV in human populations is negligible [20] and efficacy is likely greater with replication-competent vectors. The main concern with the VSV vaccine vector is that replication-competent vectors may present more significant safety challenges in humans particularly those with altered immune status.",

However, populations in this region are among the most medically disadvantaged in the world. In particular, the prevalence of individuals with a compromised immune system is high and HIV infections rates range up to 10% or more in this area [21]. While the VSV vaccine vector has been enormously successful in protecting healthy immunocompetent animals against EBOV [7],[13],[14], we are uncertain as to how these vectors would behave in individuals with altered or compromised immune systems. Therefore, we conducted a study to assess the pathogenicity and protective efficacy of the recombinant VSV-based ZEBOV vaccine vector in rhesus macaques that were infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) which is known to deplete the populations of naive CD4+ T cells, naive CD8+ T cells, and memory CD4+ T cells in these animals [22],[23]. In order to take into account the degree or severity of compromised immune function animals were selected with varying degrees of CD4+ T cell loss.",

The macaques were infected three months prior to the current study with SHIV162p3 (kindly provided by Dr. Ranajit Pal, Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc., Kensington, MD). These animals all had clinical laboratory evidence of SHIV infection as evidenced by reduced CD4+ T cell counts, decreased ratios of CD4+/CD8+ T cells (Table 1) and the presence of SHIV in plasma of four out of nine animals (Table 2). Six of the nine SHIV-infected animals were vaccinated by i.m. injection with \u223c1\u00d710\u22277 recombinant VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP. Three animals served as placebo controls and were injected in parallel with saline. All six VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated animals and two of the three control animals were challenged 31 days after the single dose immunization with 1000 pfu of ZEBOV (strain Kikwit). The monkeys were challenged with the heterologous Kikwit strain of ZEBOV as our macaque models have been developed and characterized using this strain [1],[26]. Animals were closely monitored for evidence of clinical illness (e.g., temperature, weight loss, changes in complete blood count, and blood chemistry) during both the vaccination and ZEBOV challenge portions of the study. In addition, VSV\u0394G/ZEBOV and ZEBOV viremia and shedding were analyzed after vaccination and challenge, respectively. Animals were given physical exams and blood and swabs (nasal, oral, rectal) were collected at 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 31 days after vaccination and on days 3, 6, 10, 15, and 28 after ZEBOV challenge. The vaccination portion of the study was conducted at BIOQUAL and was approved by NIAID, BIOQUAL, and USAMRIID Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committees.

Therefore, we measured the antibody responses of the rhesus macaques vaccinated with VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP before vaccination (day \u22127), after vaccination (day 14 and day 31), and after ZEBOV challenge (day 46 and day 59 after vaccination) by IgG ELISA. None of the six VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques developed IgG antibody titers against the ZEBOV GP by the day of ZEBOV challenge (Figure 4). Two animals (Subjects #1, 2) developed modest IgG antibody titers against ZEBOV by day 15 after ZEBOV challenge (day 46 after vaccination) while a third animal developed a titer by day 28 after ZEBOV challenge (day 59 after vaccination) (Figure 4).",

Taking into account our previous work it is not surprising that the VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP was tolerated well in our SHIV-infected macaques. Specifically, we failed to observe evidence of any adverse events in a large cohort of over 90 macaques receiving VSV vectors expressing different GPs from viral HF agents (38 cynomolgus macaques and 3 rhesus macaques vaccinated with VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP; 12 cynomolgus macaques and 3 rhesus macaques vaccinated with VSV expressing SEBOV GP; 29 cynomolgus macaques and 3 rhesus macaques vaccinated with VSV expressing the Marburg virus GP; and 6 cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with VSV expressing the Lassa GP) ([7],[30],[31]; TW Geisbert, H Feldmann, and SM Jones unpublished observations). We have also failed to observe any adverse events in a variety of immunocompetent laboratory mice (different inbred strains), outbred guinea pigs (Hartley strain) and goats vaccinated with the above mentioned VSV vectors at doses ranging from 2\u00d7100\u20132\u00d7105 pfu ([24],[32]; SM Jones and H Feldmann, unpublished observations). More recently we have also demonstrated that vaccination of severely immunocompromised SCID mice with 2\u00d7105 pfu of the VSV-based ZEBOV vaccine (VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP) resulted in no clinical symptoms [32]. While transient VSV viremia in this study was only observed in surviving macaques but not in animals that had succumbed to ZEBOV challenge (Figure 1), viremia data from previous studies [7],[30],[31] do not support any correlation between VSV viremia and survival. In addition, no evidence for vaccine vector shedding was detected in this study supporting previous results [7],[30],[31] with no compelling evidence to suggest that occasional virus shedding (only detected by RT-PCR; negative on virus isolation) would lead to vaccine vector transmission.",

            "text": "The VSV glycoprotein exchange vector that we employed in this study has also shown promise as a preventive vaccine and postexposure treatment against Marburg HF [30],[33] and as a preventive vaccine against Lassa fever in nonhuman primates [31]. Similar recombinant VSV vectors have been evaluated in animal models as vaccine candidates for a number of viruses that cause disease in humans including HIV-1, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, herpes simplex virus type 2, hepatitis C virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [34]\u2013[40]. Many of these studies have employed VSV vectors that maintained either the entire VSV glycoprotein (G) or the transmembrane and/or cytoplamic domains of this protein to facilitate more efficient incorporation of the foreign antigen. It is known that VSV G is an important VSV protein associated with pathogenicity [38],[41]. It has been shown that truncation of the cytoplasmic tail has greatly reduced vector pathogenicity in mice following intranasal inoculation indicating the importance of this domain for pathogenicity [42]. In this regard, a VSV vector including portions of the VSV G and expressing HIV genes was found to be insufficiently attenuated for clinical evaluation when assessed for neurovirulence in nonhuman primates [43]. These investigators subsequently showed that safety and immunogenicity can be improved by genetic manipulation of the VSV genome but it remained unclear whether neurovirulence was associated with the VSV G or other genome manipulations [44]. Nevertheless, our ZEBOV vaccine is a G-deficient VSV vector [24] and thus lacks G-associated pathogenicity [41] as well as the target for VSV-specific neutralizing antibodies [45]. Aside from G, the VSV matrix (M) protein has been associated with cytopathic effects in vitro including the inhibition of host gene expression, induction of cell rounding and induction of apoptosis [46],[47]. It is largely unclear to what extent M alone contributes to pathogenicity, but inoculation studies with the VSV-based vaccines in different animal species (as described above) do not suggest a major pathogenic effect of the M protein in vivo\n[7],[13],[32].",

Nearly all studies have detected modest to good humoral immune responses. For the VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP vaccine a humoral response is detected in macaques by day 14 after vaccination ([7]; TW Geisbert, unpublished observations). However, in the current study and consistent with an impaired immune system, our SHIV-infected macaques did not develop a humoral immune response by the time of ZEBOV challenge. Three animals developed modest anti-ZEBOV IgG titers 14 to 28 days after ZEBOV challenge. We are uncertain as to why four of the six VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques survived ZEBOV challenge. Regardless of any humoral immune response elicited in these animals it is unlikely that antibody alone confers protection. Specifically, passive antibody studies in nonhuman primates using a variety of anti-ZEBOV immune reagents including polyclonal equine immune globulin [25], a recombinant human monoclonal antibody [48], and convalescent monkey blood [49] have uniformly failed to provide protection and more importantly have failed to provide any beneficial effect.",

            "text": "A number of studies have evaluated the cellular immune response in nonhuman primates vaccinated against EBOV and the results have been mixed with some studies showing a modest cellular response and other studies showing weak and/or no cellular immune responses [7],[9],[10]. However, it is likely that the intracellular cytokine assays that have been employed in some of these studies are not sensitive or thorough enough to detect a cellular immune response against ZEBOV. Indeed, it has been reported that the inability to demonstrate a robust cellular response may illustrate the limitation of the evaluation of cellular immune responses using small numbers of functional measurements (such as interferon-gamma) [50]. One interesting finding in the current study may begin to shed some light on the mechanism of protection elicited by the VSV\u0394G/ZEBOVGP. Notably, the two rhesus macaques that grouped together with the most severe loss of CD4+ T cells were the only animals that failed to survive ZEBOV challenge. This suggests that CD4+ T cells may play a role in mediating protective immunity in EBOV infections. CD4+ T cells have been shown to be depleted in nonhuman primate following ZEBOV infections [27],[51] and in vitro ZEBOV infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells causes massive bystander death of CD4+ T cells by apoptosis [52]. While rodents do not appear to faithfully reproduce ZEBOV infection of humans and nonhuman primates [53] studies have suggested that CD4+ T cells are required for protection of rodents against ZEBOV. Specifically, in a study using liposome-encapsulated ZEBOV antigens, Rao and colleagues showed that treatment of mice with anti-CD4 antibodies before or during vaccination abolished protection, while treatment with anti-CD8 antibodies had no effect, thus indicating a requirement for CD4+ T lymphocytes for successful immunization [54]. Similarly, depletion of CD8+ T cells did not compromise protection in mice indicating that CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are not a requirement for protection [32].",

Protection in the immunocompromised macaques appeared to be dependent on CD4+ T cells rather than the development of EBOV-specific antibodies. This provides strong support for the safety of the VSV-based vectors and further development of this promising vaccine platform for its use in humans. While these data are very encouraging, as the number of SHIV-infected macaques in the current study was small, additional safety studies will be needed in order to determine whether vaccines based on attenuated VSV will ultimately prove safe in immunocompromised humans.",
