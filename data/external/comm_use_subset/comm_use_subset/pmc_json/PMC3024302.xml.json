            "text": "During the last decade, DNA-based immunization has been promoted as a new approach to prime specific humoral and cellular immune responses to protein antigens [8]. In mouse models, DNA vaccines have been successfully directed against a wide variety of tumors, almost exclusively by driving strong cellular immune responses in an antigen-specific fashion [9]. However, there is still a need to improve the delivery of DNA vaccines and to increase the immunogenicity of antigens expressed from the plasmids [8,9]. For example, tumor burden has been decreased by novel DNA vaccine strategies that deliver cytokines as plasmids directly into tumors in both mouse and human models. Altogether, the selected trials for DNA vaccines have shown that immune responses can be generated in humans, but they also highlight the need for increased potency if this vaccine technology is to be effective [9]. The reasons for the failure of DNA vaccines to induce potent immune responses in humans have not been elucidated. However, it is reasonable to assume that low levels of antigen production, inefficient cellular delivery of DNA plasmids and insufficient stimulation of the innate immune system have roles in low potency of DNA vaccine [10]. Therefore, with further optimization DNA vaccine strategies can be improved, with significant effects on the outcome of immunization. In designing vaccine, clearly regimens, plasmid dose, timing of doses, adjuvants, delivery systems and/or routes of vaccination must be considered [11]. Indeed, efforts to improve these aspects of DNA vaccines have resulted in their enhanced efficacy in animals. However, the uptake of DNA plasmids by cells upon injection is very inefficient. Nowadays, two basic strategies have been applied for increasing DNA vaccine potency including a) physical delivery to achieve higher levels of antigen production and b) formulation with microparticles to target antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [10]. Both approaches are effective in animal models, but have yet to be evaluated fully in human clinical trials.",

This approach, which is similar to the effective smallpox-vaccination technique, seems to decrease the time that is required for the induction of potent immune responses and protective immunity. This effect might be related to the rapid and highly transient nature of antigen production after vaccination. Gene expression after DNA tattooing has been shown to be higher than that after intradermal injection and gene gun delivery [15]. As compared to intramuscular injection, DNA delivery by tattooing seems to produce different gene expression patterns. One study showed that tattooing of 20 \u03bcg DNA results at least ten times lower peak values of gene expression than intramuscular injection of 100 \u03bcg DNA in mouse model [15]. Gene expression after tattooing showed a peak after six hours that it disappeared over the next four days. On the contrary, the intramuscular injection of DNA resulted in high levels of gene expression with a peak after one week that it was detectable up to one month. Despite the lower dose of DNA and decreased gene expression, DNA delivered by tattoo induced higher antigen-specific cellular as well as humoral immune responses than that by intramuscular DNA injection [15].",

In this study, a codon modified gene encoding the L1 major capsid protein of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) was used as a model antigen [15]. The results indicated that molecular adjuvants substantially enhance the efficiency of the HPV16 L1 DNA vaccine when administered intramuscularly. Also, the delivery of the HPV16 L1 DNA in the absence of adjuvants using a tattoo device elicited much stronger and more rapid humoral and cellular immune responses than intramuscular needle delivery together with molecular adjuvants. However, the tattoo delivery of DNA is a cost-effective method that may be used in laboratory conditions when more rapid and more robust immune responses are required [15].",

These events stimulate DC maturation and migration to the local lymphoid tissue, where DCs prime T cells for antigen-specific immune responses [18].

In a study in mouse, the immunological and anti-tumor responses was evaluated by administration of the plasmid DNA encoding extracellular domain of human EGFR through three different methods: needle intramuscular administration, gene gun administration using gold-coated DNA and gene gun administration using non-coating DNA [14]. Among these methods, gene gun administration using non-coating plasmid DNA induced the strongest cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and best anti-tumor effects in lung cancer animal model, which may provide the basis for the design of DNA vaccine in human clinical trial in the future. Altogether, route of DNA immunization and its formulation could represent an important element in the design of EGFR DNA vaccine against EGFR-positive tumor [14]. Furthermore, the effect of the CpG motif was observed to switch the Th2-type cytokine microenvironment produced by gene-gun bombardment in draining lymph nodes. The results showed that the addition of the CpG motif can increase IL-12 mRNA expression in draining lymph nodes whether induced by intradermal injection, intramuscular injection or gene-gun bombardment [19]. These data suggest that delivery of the CpG motif induces a Th1-biased microenvironment in draining lymph nodes. Taken together, the CpG motif can act as a 'danger signal' and an enhancer of Th1 immune response in DNA vaccination [19].",

Immediately following cessation of the electrical field, these pores would close and the molecules would be trapped in the cytoplasm without causing cell death [25]. Typically, milli- and microsecond pulses have been used for electroporation. Recently, the use of nanosecond electric pulses (10-300 ns) at very high magnitudes (10-300 kV/cm) has been studied for direct DNA transfer to the nucleus in vitro [26].",

Indeed, the addition of in vivo EP has been associated with a consistent enhancement of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in small and large animals, supporting its use in humans [25,27].

Interestingly, this regimen was more effective than the one consisting of two doses of DNA with EP [10]. Actually, this approach might be very attractive because it would eliminate the need for two different types of vaccine. For example, the use of a DNA vaccine expressing the CTL epitope AH1 from colon carcinoma CT26 indicated that effective priming and tumor protection in mice are highly dependent on vaccine dose and volume [28]. Indeed, electroporation during priming with the optimal vaccination protocol did not improve AH1-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In contrast, electroporation during boosting strikingly improved vaccine efficiency. Consequently, prime/boost with naked DNA followed by electroporation dramatically increased T-cell mediated immunity as well as antibody response [28]. Further work will be required to determine the mode of action of this prime-boost approach.",

Four-dose vaccination regimen resulted in a significant production of IFN-\u03b3 and provided optimal immunological effects in immunized animals.

When E6 (Co) and E7 (Co) were fused (E67 (Co)), E6/E7 antigen-specific CD8 (+) T cell responses decreased, but the preventive anti-tumor effect was rather improved. Interestingly, Flt3L-fused HPV DNA vaccine exhibited stronger E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses as well as therapeutic anti-tumor effects than that of CD40L linked HPV DNA vaccine [30]. Finally, the optimal construct, tFE67(Co), was generated by using tpa signal sequence, Flt3L, fusion of E6 and E7 and codon optimization, which induced 23 and 25 times stronger E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses than those of initial E67 fusion construct. It is noteworthy that inclusion of electroporation in intramuscular immunization of tFE67 (Co) further increased HPV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, leading to complete tumor regression in a therapeutic vaccination [30]. This vaccine regimen induced 34- and 49-fold higher E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T cell response, respectively, as compared to responses observed following vaccination with E67. Thus, these evidences suggest that tFE67 (Co) delivered with electroporation is a promising therapeutic HPV DNA vaccine against cervical cancer [30].",

            "text": "Lipid-based systems (e.g., liposomes) are commonly used in human clinical trials especially in anti-cancer gene therapy [10,35]. Cationic lipids are amphiphilic molecules composed of one or two fatty acid side chains (acyl) or alkyl, a linker and a hydrophilic amino group. The hydrophobic part can be cholesterol-derived moieties. In aqueous media, cationic lipids are assembled into a bilayer vesicular-like structure (liposomes). Liposomes/DNA complex is usually termed a lipoplex. Negatively charged DNA will neutralize cationic liposomes resulting in aggregation and continuous fusion with time while DNA being entrapped during this process. Because of poor stability (i.e., continuous aggregation), lipoplexes are usually administered directly after their formation. The favorable, stable and small lipoplex particles were produced with the development of the novel liposomal formulation, liposomes/protamine/DNA (LPD). Protamine is arginine-rich peptide, which can condense negatively charged DNA before being complexed with cationic lipids [43,54]. Figure 3A shows the lipoplex-mediated transfection. However, one of the most important drawbacks of these systems is the lack of targeting and non-specific interaction with cells [10,35]. Currently, liposomal nanoparticles (LNs) encapsulating therapeutic agents, or liposomal nanomedicines, represent an advanced class of drug delivery systems, with several formulations in clinical trials. Over the past 20 years, a variety of techniques have been developed for encapsulating both conventional drugs (such as anticancer drugs and antibiotics) and the new genetic drugs (plasmid DNA containing therapeutic genes, antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA) within LNs. If the LNs possess certain properties, they tend to accumulate at sites of disease, such as tumors, where the endothelial layer is 'leaky' and allows extravasation of particles with small diameters. These properties include a diameter centered on 100 nm, a high drug-to-lipid ratio, excellent retention of the encapsulated drug, and a long circulation lifetime (> 6 h). These properties permit the LNs to protect their contents during circulation, prevent contact with healthy tissues, and accumulate at sites of disease. Liposomal nanomedicines have the potential to offer new treatments in such areas as cancer therapy, vaccine development and cholesterol management [55].",

Stimuvax consists of MUC1 lipopeptide BLP25 [STAPPAHGVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPK (Pal) G], an immunoadjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A, and three lipids (cholesterol, dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine), capable of enhancing the delivery of the vaccine to APCs. A randomized phase II B clinical trial evaluated the effect of Stimuvax on survival and toxicity in 171 patients with stage III B and IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), after stable disease or response to first-line chemotherapy. Based on these data, Merck is currently conducting three large phase III clinical trials of Stimuvax. This study will involve more than 1300 patients [57].",

Chitosan is a biodegradable polysaccharide obtained from deacetylated chitin and the commercial product has an average molecular weight ranging between 4 and 20 kDa. It contains several amino groups that in acidic pH may undergo protonation leading to its solubilization in water. Chitosan may also establish electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA to form complexes (polyplexes).

The nature of PEI polymers enables the targeting ligands and/or polyethylene glycol (PEG) (producing sterically stabilized gene carriers) to their surfaces [43]. For example, pegylated PEI polyplexes were linked to tumor specific ligand transferring an asialoglycoprotein and then applied intravenously, resulting in five-fold increase in the transfection efficiency with lower toxicity in comparison with pegylated (transferrin-free) PEI polyplexes [59].

Treated mice were given s.c. or i.p. injections of different polycations at non-toxic doses [61]. Survival of solid Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice was significantly increased by high-molecular-weight polyethyleneimine, polyvinylamine, and polypropyleneimine at neutral pH administered as late as 5 days after tumor transplant, accompanied by a 10 to 40% reduction in growth of the solid tumor [61]. Survival of mice bearing leukemia cells in ascites form was improved only by polypropyleneimine. Increase in survival also resulted if the polycation was administered up to 9 days before Ehrlich tumor transplant, with no evidence of weight loss in the host at time of tumor transplant. Thus, cationic polymers may be effective by non-specific stimulation of host immune response to transplanted cells as well as by direct electrostatic cytotoxic interaction with tumor cells [61].",

The major obstacle is providing delivery vehicles with the adequate surface molecules for recognition by the immune system and for more-effective targeting. It is likely, therefore, that future studies of PLGA NPs as vaccine candidates will focus on improving these features, as recently tested by grafting RGD peptides (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-containing synthetic peptides) covalently onto PEG moieties on the surface of PLGA NPs [62]. These polymers have been designated as feasible candidates for drug delivery systems, anti-cancer agents and vaccine immunotherapy. For example, DNA vaccine delivery to APCs has been facilitated by microencapsulation of plasmid DNA, which encodes HPV E6/E7 antigenic proteins. The capsule is formed from polymeric PGLA microparticles. These resulting microparticles have a greater propensity toward APC uptake compared to naked DNA. This technique allows HPV DNA plasmid to be condensed inside the microparticle. The physical and chemical properties of the PGLA scaffold render DNA inaccessible to nuclease and preventing degradation, allowing for a sustained release of DNA and enhancing transfection efficiency in vitro [18]. In mice, microspheres containing HPV plasmid encoding HPV E6/E7 antigens have been shown to elicit a strong antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell response. Using this technology, microencapsulated DNA vaccine termed ZYC-101 encoding multiple HLA-A2 restricted HPV E7 epitopes has undergone Phase I trials in patients with CIN2/3 lesions and high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia. In both trials, intramuscularly administered vaccine was well tolerated, and in some patients had resulted in histological regression of the lesions as well as generation of E7-specific IFN-\u03b3 expressing T cells. A newer version of the DNA vaccine, ZYC-101a, which encodes HPV16 and HPV18 E6- and E7-derived epitopes has been used in phase II clinical trial in patients with CIN 2/3 lesions [18].",

Fluorescent chitosan coated quantum dots (QDs) were used to act as bi-functional bridging units between cancer and immune cells.

            "text": "Various natural and/or synthetic cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) have known as efficient tools in vaccine design as they are capable of delivering therapeutic targets into cellular compartments. In fact, the cell membrane is impermeable to hydrophilic substances and delivery into cells could be facilitated by linking to CPP. Different cargos such as drugs, peptide/protein, oligonucleotide/DNA/RNA, nanoparticles, liposomes, bacteriophages, fluorescent dyes and quantum dots have been linked to CPPs for intracellular delivery with possible use in future vaccine design [66]. Two applications of CPP already validated in vaccine studies are delivery of tumor-associated antigens into antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and use as a non-viral gene delivery vehicle in DNA vaccines [66]. There are two methods for designing CPP incorporating immunogenic antigens: 1) chemical linking via covalent bonds 2) coupling via recombinant fusion constructs produced by bacterial expression vectors. The orientation of the peptide and cargo and the type of linkage are likely important [66]. In addition, the utilized CPP, attached cargo, concentration and cell type, all significantly affect the mechanism of internalization. The mechanism of cellular uptake and subsequent processing still remains controversial. It is now apparent that CPP mediate intracellular delivery via both endocytic and non-endocytic pathways [66-68]. An attractive feature of using polypeptides as gene delivery vectors is incorporating multiple functional domains into one polypeptide chain, such as a DNA-binding domain linked with a receptor-targeting domain. This kind of polypeptides will recognize and bind to cell surface receptors that are unique to target cells and deliver the bound DNA into the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, this process may ensure the therapeutic effect in desired cells and limit the potential side effects caused by transgene expression in non-target cells [69]. Figure 3B demonstrates the peptide-based nucleic acid delivery systems.",

The \"transduction domain\" or region conveying the cell penetrating properties is clearly confined to a small stretch of basic amino acids, with the sequence RKKRRQRRR (residues 49-57) [71,72]. This polycationic nanopeptide is known to be a transfection enhancer of plasmid DNA. The conditions of DNA-peptide complex formation and DNA/Tat ratio have significant impact on the level of transgene expression and degree of DNA protection from nuclease attack [49]. The conjugation of this peptide to ovalbumin (OVA) resulted in efficient stimulation of MHC class I-restricted T cell responses in vitro and, more importantly, the generation of CTLs in vivo [73]. Also, soluble Tat-antigen conjugates can deliver the antigen directly to the MHC class I processing pathway and thereby increase the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro [73,74]. A fusion protein containing the carboxy-terminal end of Tat (amino acids: 49-86) linked to the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein enhanced tumor specific immune responses in vivo [75]. In C57BL/6 mice, E7-Tat mixed with Quil A generated efficient prophylactic and therapeutic suppression of HPV16-positive C3 tumor outgrowth. This study offers a new strategy for improving subunit cancer vaccines [75]. Particularly, a Tat-derived peptide in combination with a PEG-PEI copolymer could be a promising candidate as gene delivery vehicle intended for pulmonary administration. Tat-PEG-PEI represents a new approach to non-viral gene carrier for lung therapy, comprising protection for plasmid DNA, low toxicity and significantly enhanced transfection efficiency under in vivo conditions [76].",

Our data indicated that both delivery systems including PEI 25 kDa and PEI600-Tat conjugate are efficient tools for E7 gene transfection. In fact, PEI potency for E7 gene transfection is higher than PEI600-Tat in vitro, but its toxicity is obstacle in vivo [80]. Using HPV16 E7 as a model antigen, the effect of PEI600-Tat conjugate has been evaluated on the potency of antigen-specific immunity in mice model. Assessment of lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses against recombinant E7 protein (rE7) showed that PEI600-Tat/E7DNA complex at certain ratio induces Th1 response. This study has demonstrated that PEI600-Tat conjugate is efficient to improve immune responses in vivo [81]. Synthetic peptides containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) can be bound to the DNA and the resulting DNA-NLS complexes can be recognized as a nuclear import substrate by specific intracellular receptor proteins [8]. For example, conjugation of an NLS to a Minimalistic Immunogenically Defined Gene Expression (MIDGE) vector encoding a truncated and secreted form of BHV-1 glycoprotein D (tgD) improved the tgD expression in vitro and induced both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice [8].

            "text": "One of the CPPs that have currently received extensive attention in the field of DNA vaccination is the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) protein VP22 [66]. VP22 can form compacted complexes with short oligonucleotides and form particles of spherical nature with a size range of 0.3 to 1 \u03bcm in diameter. These particles entered cells efficiently within 2 to 4 hours. Furthermore, VP22 enables spreading of the antigenic peptide to the cells surrounding the transfected cells [66]. Efforts have been made to increase the potency of DNA vaccines by exploiting the cell-to-cell spreading capabilities of the HSV-1 VP22 protein or the analogous protein from bovin herpesvirus 1 [10]. The significance of VP22 in intercellular spreading has been demonstrated through in vitro studies linking VP22 to p53, thymidine kinase, cytosine deaminase and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). These proteins were observed to be distributed to nuclei of surrounding cells [18]. Furthermore, vaccination with DNA encoding HPV16E7 linked to the HSV type 1 VP22 elicited the enhanced E7-specific memory CD8+ T lymphocytes and anti-tumor effects against E7-expressing tumor cells [82]. Also, VP22 has been used for HPV DNA vaccines targeting the E6 protein [18]. Various groups have demonstrated that DNA constructs which encode fusion proteins of VP22 linked to an antigen increase the immune responses in mice and cattle. Bovine herpesvirus VP22 (BVP22) and Marek's disease virus VP22 (MVP-1) are both closely related by their structural homology to HSV-1 VP22, and can also have a significant role in intercellular spreading. Hung et al. has demonstrated that mice vaccinated with DNA encoding MVP22/E7 significantly increased numbers of IFN-\u03b3-secreting, E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors compared to mice vaccinated with wild-type E7 DNA alone, which directly lead to a stronger tumor prevention response. Similarly, immunization of mice and cattle with DNA vaccine coding for BVP22 linked to truncated glycoprotein D (BVP-tgD) was shown to generate a stronger tgD-specific immune response compared to animals vaccinated with tgD alone. Taken together, DNA vaccine encoding VP22 linked to antigens represents a promising approach to enhance DNA vaccine potency [18].",

To evaluate the VP22 role in gene therapy of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), the expression vectors were constructed for N- and C-terminal fragments of VP22-p53 fusion proteins and investigated the VP22-mediated shuttle effect in hepatoma cells by co-transfection experiments. VP22-mediated trafficking was not detectable in hepatoma cells in vitro by fluorescence microscopy [83]. For in vivo experiments, the recombinant adenoviruses Ad5CMVp53 and Ad5CMVp53-VP22 were constructed.

In addition to the use of VLPs as direct immunogens, the efficiency that they stimulate cellular and humoral responses has made them prime candidates as carrier molecules for the delivery of epitopes, DNA and small molecules targeting other diseases [84]. The reason that many VLPs make excellent carrier molecules for the delivery of epitopes in vaccines is most likely because the particulate VLP structure is readily taken up into antigen presenting cells and thus is able to prime long lasting CTL responses as well as antibody responses [84]. Notable work has been done in this area with the hepatitis B core particles, human papillomavirus VLPs and parvovirus VLPs displaying T-cell specific epitopes from another protein on their capsid. These studies demonstrate that like bacterial epitope display systems, VLPs are efficient stimulators of MHC class I and class II responses [84]. Consequently, VLPs have great potential as epitope display systems for other diseases.",

            "text": "Human papillomavirus-like particles (HPV VLP) are a candidate vaccine for prevention of HPV infection and also an immunogenic delivery system for incorporated antigen. For example, an L1-E7 fusion protein has been shown to self-assemble into chimeric VLPs (cVLPs) that can be used to enhance E7-specific cellular immune responses in mice [85]. Also, L2-E7 or L2-E7-E2 fusion proteins have been generated and incorporated into chimeric VLPs that have been shown to provide similar enhancement of E7-and/or E2-specific responses [86,87]. In addition to using VLPs for delivery of viral early proteins, VLPs consisting of L1 alone have been indicated to be capable of delivering plasmid DNA into cells grown in vitro [88]. The researchers have shown previously that polyomavirus VP1 VLPs [89,90] or HPVL1 VLPs [91,92], are able to mediate delivery and expression of plasmid DNA in vitro. Interestingly, the recent evidence has suggested that VLPs consisting of both the L1 major and L2 minor capsid proteins are more efficient for DNA delivery than VLPs consisting of L1 alone [93]. Kamper et al. [94] showed that DNA co-delivered with L1 VLPs is retained within endosomes, and that efficient egress from this compartment is dependent on a 23 amino acid sequence located within the L2 carboxyl-terminal region. Thus, a potentially important role for L2 has been identified in facilitating DNA delivery and expression in vitro. These findings support the development of VLP-based strategies for both prophylaxis and therapy of HPV-associated diseases, and for using VLPs in an effort to avoid barriers commonly encountered with DNA-based immunization strategies [88,93]. Additional evidence to support this concept was generated in experiments in which co-administration of VLPs with a plasmid designed to express HPV16 E6 oncoprotein was associated with significant enhancement of plasmid-encoded E6-specific cellular immune responses [93]. Consistent with these findings, co-administration of L1/L2 VLPs with pcDNA-CRT/E6 expression plasmid has been associated with significant enhancement of E6-specific cellular immune responses [93].",

Intradermal immunization led to the largest level of lymph node involvement for the longest period of time, which correlated with the strongest humoral and cellular immune responses.

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells capable of initiating a primary immune response and possess the ability to activate T cells and stimulate the growth and differentiation of B cells. DCs provide a direct connection between innate and adaptive immune response, and arise from bone marrow precursors that are present in immature forms in peripheral tissues, where they are prepared to capture antigens. DCs migrate from the peripheral tissues to the closest lymph nodes through afferent lymphatic vessels to present the foreign antigens, stimulating T-cell activation and initiating a cellular immune response [15]. In dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy, it is important that DCs present peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens on MHC class I, and activate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. However, MHC class I generally present endogenous antigens expressed in the cytosol. Several researchers have developed antigen delivery tools based on the cross presentation theory of exogenous antigens for DCs. In these studies, various types of antigen delivery carriers such as liposomes [98,99], poly-(\u03b3-glutamic acid) nanoparticles [100] and cholesterol pullulan nanoparticles [101], which can deliver antigen into DCs via the endocytosis pathway, have been used. Furthermore, IgG modified liposomes with entrapped antigen have been reported to induce cross presentation of exogenous antigen for DCs on MHC class I molecules [102]. These carriers deliver antigens into DCs via an endocytosis mechanism, likely due to exogenous antigen leaking from the endosome into the cytosol. In other study, DCs pulsed with exogenous antigens by electroporation presented their antigens on MHC class I molecules and resulted in inducing MHC class I-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Although electroporation is commonly utilized to deliver gene such as DNA and RNA into cytosol, Kim et al. and Weiss et al. applied this system to antigen delivery into DCs [103,104]. Moreover, Suzuki et al. investigated the effect of antigen delivery using perfluoropropane gas-entrapping liposomes (Bubble liposomes, BLs) and ultrasound (US) exposure on MHC class I presentation levels in DCs, as well as the feasibility of using this antigen delivery system in DC-based cancer immunotherapy. DCs were treated with ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen. Ovalbumin was directly delivered into the cytosol but not via the endocytosis pathway, and OVA-derived peptides were presented on MHC class I [105]. Immunization with DCs treated with OVA, BLs and US exposure efficiently induced OVA-specific CTLs and resulted in the complete rejection of E.G7-OVA tumors [96]. These data indicate that the combination of BLs and US exposure is a promising antigen delivery system in DC-based cancer immunotherapy.",

The specific levels of serum IgG and intestinal IgA were observed as well as specific CD4+ T cell proliferation in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes in CBA/J mice vaccinated with p24-NPs DCs [106].

Herein, DCs were pulsed with synthetic peptides that represent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes of HPV16 E7.

The objective was to determine the safety and induction of the immune response using these vaccinations.

For optimal performance, antigen delivery vehicles should closely mimic the composition and immunological processing of actual pathogens; they should actively or passively target APCs such as DCs; protect the antigenic protein from degradation; direct the nature of the resulting immune response (i.e., cellular versus humoral responses) and last, induce APC maturation by interacting with elements of the innate immune system such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Several strategies have been reported including directly conjugating TLR ligands to protein antigens or co-encapsulating immunostimulatory agents and proteins in liposomes or hydrophobic polymeric particles [107]. Furthermore, an antigen delivery system has been generated which is based on acid-degradable, acetal-cross-linked, hydrogel particles designed for uptake by APCs. Compared to non-degradable systems, these microparticles greatly enhance the efficacy of MHCI antigen presentation and the subsequent activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are crucial in cancer immunotherapy [107]. To affect APC maturation, a method has recently reported for the incorporation of an immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotide into the polymer backbone of the particles. Following phagocytosis by APCs, these particles were designed to degrade in the acidic environment of endosomal vesicles and release their protein as well as a CpG-polymer conjugate capable of binding TLR9, an endosomal receptor for un-methylated viral and bacterial DNA. TLR9 ligation resulted in APC activation and maturation and led to the subsequent migration of APCs to draining lymph nodes [104]. Although, these microparticles were effective in generating antigen specific immunity, they required a relatively high CpG content, which was due to a loss in activity of the CpG caused by its covalent linkage to the polymer scaffold [107].",

Conserved microbial motifs can trigger innate responses, through binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of APCs. Linking peptide antigens with TLR agonists in a single construct has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing peptide immunogenicity. Many designs for delivering antigenic peptides and adjuvants have been explored, including direct peptide-adjuvant conjugates, and particulate systems such as liposomes, virus-like particles, degradable polymers and non-degradable solid-core beads.

            "text": "Prophylactic and therapeutic responses against infectious diseases and cancer can be induced systemically and at mucosal surfaces by activating the mucosal immune system. Different challenges are associated with different types of mucosal vaccines. Thus, administration routes, carrier systems and adjuvants were considered that can be used to overcome these challenges to enhance mucosal vaccination. The use of particle-mediated delivery systems is an effective strategy to enhance mucosal vaccination by protecting immunogenic material during delivery, providing targeted delivery systems, and allowing incorporation of adjuvant material [113]. The mucosal immune system has been established as an ideal target site for vaccines. Many pathogens infect the host at a specific entry site in the mucosal surface, specifically the M-cells. Hence, it can be an effective strategy for vaccination to target the immunization to these cells. Traditionally, vaccines are administered by injection (e.g., intramuscular vaccination) and will most probably elicit systemic immune responses but only insufficient mucosal responses. On the other side, oral or respiratory immunization usually favors the development of mucosal antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses [113]. The efficacy of M-cell delivery of DNA or any other orally administered vaccine is dependent on 1) whether the administered agents can survive into the gastric and intestinal environments, including pH-induced degradation, enzymes, and diffusion across mucus layer; and 2) whether residence time in the intestine is long enough for sufficient interaction with target cells so that these can endocytose the vaccines. Because of this, oral administration of a vaccine often requires delivery systems that can provide protection against enzymatic degradation and elimination in the gastrointestinal tract in order to maintain a high bioavailability [113]. One way to ensure efficacy of immunization is by shielding the payload from the gastrointestinal tract by encapsulation or inclusion into microspheres or a multi-phase systems such as water-oil-water multiple emulsions. Also, biologically active polymers can be used to further broaden the application. Another way to improve vaccine delivery is by extending the intestinal residence time using specific muco- or bio-adhesins binding to intestinal mucus or to the apical surfaces of epithelial cells in the intestine. However, strategic selection of materials used in the development of mucosal vaccine delivery can also benefit from intrinsic immunoadjuvants effect (e.g., Pluronic copolymers and squalane oil) to enhance the immunogenic response and improve the vaccine efficacy [107]. Successful mucosal vaccination for acute and chronic diseases will require greater understanding of disease pathology, advances in the biology of mucosal immunity in the nasal and gastrointestinal tract, development of multivalent antigens that can elicit potent and long-lasting immune responses and advances in materials science and technology that can be used to develop more effective and targeted delivery systems [113].",

Mice were immunized with a tumor cell-based vaccine that was labeled with SPIO. APCs that had captured SPIO were imaged over time as they accumulated in lymph nodes. It was indicated that MRI is capable of monitoring, in vivo, the trafficking of magnetically labeled APCs inducing a tumor-specific immune response, and that these cells can be magnetically recovered ex vivo. Excellent correlation was observed between in vivo and ex vivo quantification of APCs, with resolution sufficient to detect increased APC trafficking elicited by an adjuvant [114].",

Due to the limitations correlated to viral vectors, non-viral vectors have been further focused as an alternative in delivery systems. Non-viral vectors include cationic polymers such as polyethylenimine (PEI), polylysine (PLL), cationic peptides and cationic liposomes. Currently, many modifications to the current delivery systems and novel carrier systems have been developed to optimize the transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the route of immunization can influence the outcome of the immune response through altering the interaction between the vaccine and different APCs at the site of injection. Hence, the routes of administration and formulation of DNA clearly affect the therapeutic response by altering immune pathway. Among the commonly used methods of DNA vaccination, the highest efficacy was achieved after in vivo electroporation and gene gun delivery.

Alternatively, DNA might be degraded within the lysosome. B) peptide-based nucleic acid delivery systems: Both covalent attachment and/or non-covalent complexes of peptide-DNA are acting similar to lipid-based systems. The designed cationic peptides must be able to 1) tightly condense DNA into small, compact particles; 2) target the condensate to specific cell surface receptors; 3) induce endosomal escape; and 4) target the DNA cargo to the nucleus for reporter gene expression.",
