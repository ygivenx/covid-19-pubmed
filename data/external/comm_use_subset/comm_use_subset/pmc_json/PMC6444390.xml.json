It is estimated that 35\u201355%, or more, of HAIs are preventable [4, 5], although rates are highly variable, depending on how effectively IPC measures are implemented [6, 7]. Failures of routine hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) practices, in high income countries during this century, have resulted in devastating nosocomial outbreaks of exotic or emerging infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, in 2003 [8] and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Seoul in 2015 [9], causing preventable deaths and massive social and economic disruption.",

Nevertheless, the use of hand hygiene as a surrogate for IPC quality and the moral status of noncompliance have been questioned, largely as a consequence of ongoing controversy about auditing methods and plausible compliance targets [13\u201315]. Ethical considerations have particular salience in light of numerous studies reporting lower than average compliance with IPC policies among doctors, compared with other health professionals, albeit with wide variation [16\u201318]. Doctors\u2019 attitudes and behaviours are important, because they disproportionately influence those of other hospital staff and doctors often overestimate their own knowledge and compliance [19, 20]. Yet their peripatetic clinical practice provides numerous opportunities to transmit pathogens [21] and to be pathogen \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d [22, 23].",

Despite recent attempts to redefine \u201cmedical professionalism\u201d, a universally agreed definition remains elusive; but all versions include common commitments to e.g. patient welfare; maintenance of knowledge and skills; and securing public trust through professional self-regulation and avoidance of conflicts of interest [27\u201329]. How doctors interpret these commitments depends on how they perceive their professional identity [30]. In practice, their attitudes and practices are complex and sometimes perplexing. Assuming that patient welfare is doctors\u2019 highest priority [31], one may reasonably ask why some would expose their patients to preventable infection risks by failing to observe well-established IPC rules [30, 32]?",

At the other extreme, several participants \u2013 independently - cited examples of units in which IPC standards were notoriously poor and HAI rates (reputedly) excessive; they also described individual consultants who had to be reminded, repeatedly, about basic IPC precautions and who vehemently demurred, refused or tried to avoid situations where they may be asked, to comply:From a political point of view, we (intensive care unit [ICU] clinicians) are in a bind. We encourage outside (surgical) teams to see their high-risk patients daily, (but) they're saying \u201cI don't want to go to ICU, they always give me a hard time about washing my hands or taking my jacket off\u201d. So, we're trying to make sure that they have easy access to the patients, but in such a way that the whole process is smooth. For some clinicians, hand hygiene presents an objectionable obstacle.

Participants identified leadership, as others have done [46], as an important determinant of (good or bad) IPC practice. Within a hierarchical hospital system, leadership is usually based on seniority, status and power [48]. Most senior consultants exercise their leadership roles appropriately and model acceptable or exemplary IPC practices but the attitudes of the minority, who repeatedly ignore or dispute basic IPC precautions, will also be transferred to junior doctors. Medical students are now taught about the importance of IPC and the risks of HAI and AMR but, as postgraduate trainees, they absorb the hidden curricula [47] of the specialties and units in which they train, which may be at odds with what they have been taught. Once entrenched, senior doctors\u2019 habituated behaviours are difficult to change, since even their peers are deterred, by professional etiquette and their own uncertainties, from challenging colleagues\u2019 unsafe practices [49].",

These problems are compounded by lack of data. Results of mandatory reporting to health authorities or internal incident reports of serious, but rare HAI-related events, such as bloodstream infections or unplanned readmissions, have little resonance and there are virtually no data about less serious HAIs. So it is impossible to monitor trends or reflect on individual consultant\u2019s or unit\u2019s performances vis-\u00e0-vis their peers, despite evidence that surveillance and feedback of results can motivate IPC improvement and reduce HAI rates [7, 52]. The lack of consistent national HAI surveillance, in Australia, is a recognised barrier to sustained IPC behavior change, particularly among doctors, and State- or hospital-based surveillance is highly variable [53].",

Moreover, the hostile reactions of some doctors, to being reminded about basic IPC precautions, were interpreted as a manifestation of the bullying, which is endemic in healthcare settings in many countries, including Australia [54, 55], and as \u2018yet another\u2019 failure of professional self-regulation [56]. In this regard, recent media scrutiny of withdrawal of postgraduate training accreditation from two major Sydney public hospitals, largely as a consequence of bullying and harassment by senior medical staff [57, 58], raises the question of whether hospital administrators and specialist colleges will act to address cultural problems in medicine, including bullying, more effectively.",

In most cases this is apparently sufficient but, if a pattern of behaviour emerges, it is followed by staged escalation [59]. It has proven to be feasible and effective in reducing bullying [60], patient complaints [61] and poor IPC practices [62] and limits the need for more direct disciplinary action. It has been introduced or considered by several Australian hospitals [63] and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons [64]. Such an holistic approach to organisation-wide culture change, would complement better surveillance and feed-back of HAI-related data and innovative strategies, such as the use of video-reflexive methods that have been used successfully to raise clinician awareness and improve IPC practices [65].",

The poor IPC practices of some doctors are just one aspect of the broader issue of unprofessional behaviour and immunity from criticism that must be addressed, if the medical profession, in general, is to be seen to conform with its espoused professional values and those of the community that supports it.",
