            "text": "The mechanism of replication and transcription varies greatly among viruses depending on the nature and structure of their viral genomes. Negative-strand RNA viruses replicate their viral genome via the synthesis of full length positive-strand complementary RNA (cRNA) molecules that in turn serve as templates for the synthesis of negative-strand virion RNA (vRNA) genomes. The negative-strand genomes also function as templates for the production of mRNAs [1], [2]. In non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses, sequential transcription of successive genes results in a gradient of transcript abundance that steadily decreases towards the end of the template. Thus, the expression level of each gene is governed by the gene order [3]. This does, however, not apply to all negative-strand viruses as some of them acquired segmented genomes during their evolution. Each genome segment of these viruses is individually replicated and transcribed, necessitating careful regulation of these distinctive processes to generate sufficient vRNAs and proteins for the production of progeny virions [2].",

The IAV genome is composed of eight different vRNA segments that altogether encode up to 13 proteins [4]\u2013[7]. Each vRNA and cRNA possesses untranslated regions (UTRs) of varying length at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends. The first 12 and 13 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of the vRNAs and cRNAs are highly conserved among different RNA segments. These highly conserved partly complementary UTRs, which form a \u201cpanhandle\u201d or \u201ccorkscrew\u201d conformation by alternative modes of base-pairing, constitute the promoter structure for RNA synthesis [8], [9]. The panhandle conformation results from base-pairing between 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminal ends of the viral RNA segment with a small internal loop [10], [11], while the corkscrew structure consists of a six base-pair RNA rod in the distal element in conjunction with two stem\u2013loop structures of two short-range base-pairs [12].",

These RNPs may be regarded as independent molecular machines responsible for transcription and replication of each segment. The viral RNA polymerase, which consists of the PA, PB1 and PB2 subunits, recognizes the RNA promoter, and stabilizes a supercoiled conformation of the RNPs. Different models have been proposed for the regulation of transcription and replication. One model suggests that the RNA polymerase switches from a transcriptase, used for mRNA synthesis, to a replicase, used for cRNA and vRNA synthesis, which is triggered by newly synthesized NP protein [13]. Another model suggests that cRNAs can be directly synthesized from incoming vRNAs, but require newly synthesized polymerase and NP to be stabilized in RNPs [14]. More recently, Jorba and colleagues proposed a model, in which a template RNP is replicated in trans by a soluble polymerase complex, whereas transcription of the vRNA occurs in cis and the resident polymerase complex is responsible for mRNA synthesis [15].",

As shown in Figure 2, single transfection of each reporter gene resulted in high expression levels of both the firefly (Fig. 2A) and Gaussia (Fig. 2B) luciferase genes. However, when the reporter constructs were co-transfected, the firefly luciferase expression level was dramatically reduced (Fig. 2A), while the Gaussia luciferase expression level in the same cells was not affected when compared to the single-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). The differential expression of firefly and Gaussia reporter plasmids when transfected alone or together can also be illustrated by plotting the normalized ratio of firefly to Gaussia luciferase activity (normFluc/Gluc; the normalized ratio's were calculated as indicated in the Materials and Methods section). As shown in Figure 2C, this ratio is significantly decreased upon co-transfection of the two reporter constructs, when compared to the ratio of the luciferase expression levels in the single-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained at earlier and later time points post transfection (data not shown). This indicates that the balance of firefly and Gaussia luciferase expression is strongly in favor of Gaussia luciferase, when both reporter constructs are present within the same cell. Thus, the results indicate that expression of the firefly luciferase gene is negatively affected by co-transfection of the Gaussia luciferase reporter plasmid.",

As shown in Figure 2E, this is indeed the case. Lowering the amount of co-transfected Gaussia as well as increasing the amount of co-transfected firefly luciferase reporter plasmid shifted the balance in the competition between the firefly and Gaussia luciferase genome segments as judged from the increased normFluc/Gluc ratio (Fig. 2E). This increased ratio resulted from altered firefly rather than Gaussia luciferase expression levels (Fig. S2A and B).

To analyze whether a limiting availability of viral proteins is an important factor in the competition between firefly and Gaussia luciferase genome segments, we increased the amount of plasmids encoding the RNA polymerase subunits and NP in the transfection assay. Empty plasmid (pUC18) was included in the transfection mixture when needed to achieve the same total amount plasmid DNA for each transfection condition. Upon increasing the amounts of transfected plasmids encoding PB1/PB2/PA/NP, the normFluc/Gluc ratio increased \u223c10-fold (Fig. 3A) as a result of increased firefly luciferase expression levels (Fig. S3A and B). This result indicates that increased amounts of polymerase subunits and NP can alleviate the competition between the firefly and Gaussia luciferase genome segments. Increasing the amount of transfected NP-encoding plasmid alone did not affect the normFluc/Gluc ratio (Fig. 3B) or the absolute Fluc and Gluc levels (Fig. S3C and D). Increasing the amount of polymerase subunit-encoding plasmids, but not of the NP-encoding plasmid, appeared to alleviate the competition between the two segments (Fig. 3C). However, it also negatively affected the reporter gene expression levels per se, with most dramatic effects being observed for the firefly luciferase reporter segment (Fig. S3E and F). We speculate that this negative effect correlates with the requirement for NP for replication, which appears less stringent for short RNA templates [25], [26]. Although we did not analyze the NP and polymerase protein levels directly, our results indicate that the luciferase genome segments compete for RNA polymerase subunits and/or NP, with a limiting amount of polymerase subunits being the most likely explanation for the observed competition. However, we cannot exclude that the observed competition between reporter segments is partly caused by limiting amounts of host factors.",

An obvious difference between the firefly and Gaussia genome segments is their gene length as the firefly and Gaussia luciferase genes consist of 1653 and 558 nucleotides, respectively. Small genome segments are likely to be replicated faster than long ones. To test this hypothesis, we generated an extended Gaussia luciferase gene construct, in which part of the firefly luciferase gene (3\u2032-terminal half) was inserted immediately behind the stop codon of the Gaussia luciferase gene in the GNP plasmid (referred to as GFsNP, Fig. 1A) to produce a genome segment with exactly the same length as the firefly luciferase genome segment. The extended and the normal Gaussia luciferase reporter segments were compared for their ability to compete with the firefly luciferase reporter segment. The absolute Gaussia luciferase expression level from the GFsNP segment was lower than that from the GNP segment (Fig. S4B), probably resulting from its extended length, for which is corrected by plotting normalized Fluc/Gluc ratios in Figure 4. These normFluc/Gluc ratios (Fig. 4A) indicate that the extended GFsNP segment is still a strong competitor of the FNP segment, although much less efficient than the smaller GNP segment. We conclude that segment size is an important factor in the competition between vRNA segments. However, our results also suggest that coding regions are important as FNP and GFsNP segments do not differ in size, while they contain identical 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs.",

The genome segment UTRs provide signals for viral RNA transcription and replication, as well as for packaging of vRNP into virus particles [27]. The first 12 and 13 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs, which are highly conserved among the eight viral RNA segments, constitute the promoter structure for RNA synthesis [8], [9]. Also the non-conserved regions of the different segments have been implicated in viral RNA replication [28]. We inserted the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs of the eight IAV-WSN segments (Table 1) into the extended Gaussia reporter plasmid and tested them in the competition assay with the firefly luciferase reporter construct FNP. The extended Gaussia construct was chosen instead of the short version as the former construct affects expression of the firefly luciferase construct less than the latter, resulting in a more balanced system in which it will be easier to detect UTR-dependent up and down effects. Introduction of the UTRs of different segments into the extended Gaussia reporter construct affected the balance between the Gaussia and firefly luciferase expression to different extents (Fig. 4B). Introduction of PB1, NA or NS segment UTRs resulted in balanced firefly and Gaussia luciferase expression levels as similar ratio's were observed when expressed alone or in combination (normFluc/Gluc \u223c1; Fig. 4B). When the extended Gaussia construct was provided with the PB2, PA, HA and M segment UTRs, the normalized ratio's observed after co-transfection with FNP were similar to those observed when the construct containing the NP segment UTRs was used (normFluc/Gluc <1), indicating that the balance had shifted in favor of Gaussia luciferase expression. Subsequently, we analyzed whether the absolute expression levels of the eight different Gaussia luciferase segments (Fig. S5A) correlated with their ability to inhibit expression of firefly luciferase (Fig. S5B). Correlation between inhibition of firefly luciferase expression and the expression of Gaussia luciferase with different UTRs resulted in an R2 value of 0.8 (Fig. 4C), which indicates that 80% of the variance in firefly luciferase inhibition correlates with variability in Gaussia luciferase expression levels. A similar R2 value was obtained when the results obtained with the short GNP reporter segment were also taken into account (Fig. S6). The results indicate that not only the expression of reporter genome segments, but also the balance between different reporter genome segments is affected by 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs, and that these two phenomena are largely correlated. Thus, Gaussia luciferase genome segments that are expressed to a higher extent are more efficient inhibitors of firefly luciferase expression driven by another genome segment.",

In general, the shorter segments gave stronger competition on the firefly expression compared to longer segments, with the M and NS segments having the largest effect. Correlation between inhibition on firefly luciferase expression and the gene length resulted in an R2 value of 0.7 (Fig. 5C), which indicates that 70% of the variance in firefly luciferase inhibition correlates with variability in genome segment length.

The nucleotide changes were predicted to improve base pairing of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs and thus to stabilize the panhandle structure. Considering the results described above, we expected that these mutations would affect competition between different reporter genome segments. The results show that reporter constructs containing these panhandle-stabilizing UTRs (referred to as NPph; Fig. 6A) indeed displayed 3\u20135 fold higher luciferase expression levels in the transfection assay than their wild-type UTR-containing counterparts (Fig. S8). Remarkably, however, the normalized ratio between firefly and Gaussia luciferase was much more affected by the presence of the NPph UTRs. Introducing the NPph UTR in the background of the extended Gaussia construct (GFsNPph) resulted in a much decreased normFluc/Gluc when compared to its counterpart with the wild type NP UTRs (GFsNP; Fig. 6B). A similar level of competition was not observed when the mutations that increase the number of base-pairs were introduced in the 5\u2032 UTR of the NP segment (referred to as NPphR; Fig. 6A) instead of in the 3\u2032UTR. In this case, the Gaussia, rather than the firefly luciferase expression was affected by the co-transfection of both reporter plasmids (normFluc/Gluc >1; Fig. 6B and Fig. S8B). Similar results were obtained when NPph UTR was introduced in the firefly luciferase genome segment (referred to as FNPph; Fig. 6C). In general, normFluc/Gluc was increased when FNPph rather than FNP was used, except for the combination with GNPph (Fig. 6C & Fig. S8C and D). Thus, the balance between different segments is dramatically affected by the introduction of panhandle structure-stabilizing mutations in the 3\u2032UTR.",

            "text": "Neumann and Hobom (1995) previously reported increased reporter gene expression upon the introduction of panhandle-stabilizing mutations in the 3\u2032 UTR. In their experimental system, however, the differences in reporter gene expression appeared much larger than ours. We hypothesized that this difference might be explained by Neuman and Hobom using virus infection to drive reporter gene expression, while we used transfection of polymerase subunit- and NP- encoding plasmids. Infection with IAV will not only provide viral RNA polymerase and NP, but will also introduce natural vRNPs that may compete with reporter genome segments for replication and/or transcription. Thus, in virus-infected cells, the natural virus genome segments might be preferentially replicated and transcribed over the reporter genome segments, unless the panhandle-stabilizing mutations in the 3\u2032 UTR are present. To test this hypothesis we compared reporter gene expression driven by co-transfection of expression plasmids (transfection assay) with expression driven by virus infection (infection assay). Reporter genes flanked either by natural NP UTRs or by the mutant NPph UTRs were used. Both firefly and Gaussia luciferase genes were expressed at high levels in the transfection assay, with the reporter constructs containing the NPph UTRs again displaying somewhat higher luciferase levels than their counterparts with the natural NP UTRs (Fig. 7A). However, when using the infection assay, dramatic differences in reporter gene expression levels were observed (Fig. 7B). Thus, while the reporter genes flanked by the NPph UTRs reached 1 to 2 fold higher expression levels than those flanked by the natural NP UTR in the transfection assay, this fold difference was much increased (130 to 160 fold) in the infection assay (Fig. 7C). Quantitative RT PCR confirmed that mRNAs levels of the Gaussia luciferase RNAs were very similar, regardless of the presence of the natural NP UTRs or the mutant NPph UTRs in the transfection assay, but not in the infection assay (Fig. 7D). These results are in agreement with our model, in which IAV genome segments compete for available resources, likely the viral proteins, to maximize their replication and/or transcription. Only reporter genome segments carrying panhandle-stabilizing mutations in their 3\u2032 UTR are able to efficiently compete with the natural genome segments in the infection assay.",

However, the way by which IAV regulates and balances the replication/transcription of its 8 genome segments is much less understood. In order to study and manipulate these processes, we developed a dual reporter genome segment assay that enabled us to analyze whether the replication/transcription of one genome segment is affected by that of another. Our results indicate that this is indeed the case as luciferase expression driven from a reporter genome segment was shown to be affected by the presence of other genome segments, both in the context of virus infection and in the presence of polymerase and NP proteins provided by transfection of the expression plasmids. Furthermore, our results indicate that genome segments are likely to compete with each other for the available viral proteins and that the balance between different genome segments is affected by reporter genome segment length, by the identity of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs, and probably also by their coding regions.",

In agreement herewith, IAV defective interfering (DI) RNAs, which are formed by internal deletion of progenitor RNA segments, interfere with vRNA synthesis, probably because of the competitive advantage of the smaller DI RNA molecules (reviewed by Nayak [29]). In addition, our data indicate that the coding region of the vRNA segment may also be of importance, as the extended version of the Gaussia reporter segment was still able to outcompete its firefly luciferase counterpart, albeit less efficiently than its shorter version.",

We now show that the identity of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs also influences the competition between different segments. Relatively minor differences were observed when reporter genome segments with different natural UTRs were compared in the competition assay. This result is in agreement with the observation that non-conserved regions of the UTRs contribute to some but limited extent to viral RNA replication [28], [31]. However, introducing three nucleotide changes in the 3\u2032 UTR (G3A/U5C/C8U) of the NP segment, which is predicted to stabilize the UTR panhandle structure and is known to lead to increased reporter gene expression in infected cells [23], dramatically increased the competitive ability of the reporter segment, both when replication/transcription was driven by transfection of polymerase- and NP-encoding segments and when mediated by IAV infection. Thus, while reporter segments carrying the natural NP UTRs or the mutant NPph UTRs were both efficiently expressed in the absence of competitor segments, large differences in luciferase expression were observed in favor of the luciferase segment carrying the panhandle-stabilizing mutations when other reporter segments were co-transfected or in IAV infected cells. In agreement herewith, recombinant viruses carrying two nucleotide changes (G3A/C8U) in the UTR of either the PB1 or PA segment displayed enhanced replication/transcription of the mutated segments in detriment of the wild-type UTR-bearing segments [32].",

It is conceivable that at this stage of the infection the low level of RNA polymerase plays a critical role in the regulation of segment-specific replication and/or transcription.

After the cooling step to 4\u00b0C, 4 \u00b5l of 5\u00d7 first strand buffer, 2 \u00b5l of 0.1 M DTT, 1 \u00b5l of RNase Inhibitor (40 U/\u00b5l) were added and the mixture was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 2 min. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42\u00b0C for 50 min after addition of 1 \u00b5l superscript II reverse transcriptase (50 U/\u00b5l) and was terminated by heating at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Green (Eurogentech) on a LightCycler 480 II (Roche). qPCR forward and reverse primers (Table 2) that primed at the coding sequence of corresponding reporter gene were used to amplify cDNA. Quantitative PCR reactions were set up in triplicates according to the manufacturer's instruction by mixing 20 pmol of forward and reverse primers and 1 \u00b5l of cDNA products. The PCR mixture was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec and 1 min incubations at 95\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C, respectively. To check the specificity of PCR product, melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the PCR. The comparative Ct method was used to determine the relative mRNA levels using the housekeeping gene GAPDH as a reference [38], [39]. The mRNA levels were normalized relative to the samples in which a single reporter construct was transfected.",
