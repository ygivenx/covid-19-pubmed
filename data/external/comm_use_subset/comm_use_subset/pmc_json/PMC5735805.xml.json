Currently, six different CoV strains are known to infect humans [1]. Two of these belong to the beta CoV genus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and they cause severe respiratory diseases with case fatality rates of 9% and 35%, respectively [2]. The reservoir of these viruses is usually animal with occasional spillover into humans, possibly through an intermediate host species. Apart from animal to human transmission, human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurs mainly through nosocomial transmission [3]. Bats, with their extensive geographical distribution and flight capability, have been documented as natural hosts of a large number of diverse viruses, such as lyssaviruses, paramyxoviruses and filoviruses. Moreover, the genetic diversity of CoVs in bats exceeds that known for other hosts, which is compatible with bats being the major reservoir of mammalian CoVs [4].",

Bats have also been suspected as the evolutionary source of MERS-CoV due to the genetic similarities between beta CoVs found in bats and the MERS-CoV in humans [5, 6].",

The peptidase recognized by MERS-CoV was identified as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) [7]. The S1 domain responsible for the recognition of DPP4 receptor is located in a C-terminal 240-residue receptor binding domain and is composed of a core and an external subdomain. This external subdomain, also designated as the receptor binding motif, engages the receptor. Investigation of the DPP4-binding potential of bat CoVs is essential to better understanding the biology of these viruses, the eventual role in the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV and their potential threat to human health. Although high sequence identity in S protein was observed between BatCoVs HKU4/HKU5 and MERS-CoV, it was recently demonstrated that only the RBD of HKU4 was able to bind the human receptor DPP4 [8]. Even if it is less adapted than MERS-RBD and shows lower affinity for receptor binding, the ability of HKU4 to bind human DPP4 indicates its potential for adaptation to infect humans.",

A fragment of a CoV showing 100% identity to HCoV-EMC/2012 cloned from the index MERS case was found in a faecal sample from an Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus) in Bisha, South Arabia [5]. Partial genome sequences from viruses closely related to MERS-CoV have also been detected in bats from Africa, America and Europe [10\u201313]. CoVs originated from bats in Africa [6, 14], and in China [15], they were fully sequenced and identified as highly related to MERS-CoV. Despite all these reports, only three regarded the complete genome [6, 14, 15]. The other ones were based on short genomic sequences of a conserved fragment codifying the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is less informative and unsuitable for solid phylogenetic hypothesis. In this study, we describe the detection and full genome characterization of two CoVs closely related to MERS-CoV from Italian bats of different species, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Hypsugo savii.",

MEGA7 was used to edit, align nucleotide and amino acid sequences and to calculate the pairwise identities of the genomes and all ORFs that were predicted using the online tool ORF Finder (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html). Complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV and apha- and beta CoVs from bats, human and camels (n. 131) were obtained from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) [18] through the web site at http://www.viprbrc.org/. Multiple sequence alignment was calculated using the MUSCLE algorithm. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was performed using IQtree software [19] and Model finder to determine the best model according to BIC [20]. Genetic relationships between Italian and SA bats and MERS-CoV were confirmed by comparison of the sequence distances of MERS-CoV and bat-BCoV 2c (SA bat and IT bats) using SSE v1.2 [21]. The complete S protein and the S1 domain responsible for DPP4 recognition (located in a C-terminal 240 residue RBS of IT-bat CoVs) were compared with those of MERS-CoV, HKU4, HKU5 and MERS-related bat CoVs from China and Africa. To better investigate the relationship between MERS-CoV and related bat sequences, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the S1 protein was constructed using the IQtree software including only beta CoV sequences. Similarity plots of CoV clade c genomes were generated by using SSE v1.2 using a sliding window of 600 and a step size of 100 nucleotides (nt).",

The emergence of MERS CoV probably involved genetic exchanges between different viral ancestors that may have occurred either in bat ancestors or in camels acting as mixing vessels for viruses from different hosts. Recent studies have suggested that one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) may be a primary source of this virus in nature [28], and experimental infections of camels with MERS CoV seem to support this view [29].",

Italy is an area of high bat species diversity with more than 30 bat species documented by historical records and recent studies, but these two species, which belong to Vespertionilidae family, are the most frequently recorded [30]. Pipistrellus kuhlii forages over a variety of habitats, including agricultural and urban areas (including around street lights). Recent evidence suggests that urbanization may be beneficial to this species in that colonies in urban and suburban areas have advanced parturition and produce more offspring than colonies in rural areas, at least in central Italy [31]. H. savii forages over open woodland, pasture and wetlands and often feeds at lights in rural areas, towns and cities. This is one of the most common species in the Italian Mountains, the Apennines and the Alps below 2600 m.",

From the molecular point of view, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has established 90% amino acid sequence identity as the threshold value for CoV species demarcation of the seven concatenated domains within the ORF1ab: NSP3 (ADRP), NSP5 (3CLpro), NSP12 (RdRp), NSP13 (Hel, NTPase), NSP14 (ExoN, NMT), NSP15 (NendoU), NSP16 (OMT).

Indeed, it was demonstrated that the RBD domain in the S1 protein of HKU4 but not HKU5 can bind to the human DPP4 receptor even if with less affinity. The marked difference between HKU4-RBD and HKU5-RBD with respect to MERS-RBD is the presence of two marked deletions in the external subdomain responsible for receptor recognition [24]. Two similar deletions in the region corresponding to scaffold strands \u03b27 and \u03b28 in the MERS/HKU4-RBD structure were observed in IT bat CoVs, suggesting also for them the absence of DPP4-binding potential. Based on these results we can hypothesize that human DPP4 is not a functional receptor for IT bat CoVs as previously shown for HKU5-CoVs.",

It is believed that the majority of all alpha and beta CoVs currently circulating in mammals are evolutionarily linked to ancestral CoVs originated from bats [4]. However, more surveillance studies are needed to better investigate the potential intermediate hosts that may play a role in the interspecies transmission of known and currently unknown coronaviruses. Particular attention should be paid to investigating the S protein sequences and structures as well as receptor specificity and binding affinity as keys to understanding the biology of bat-derived viruses, their potential threat to human health and the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV.",
