Mixed populations of the two lines were housed in two isolators. In one isolator the resistant Line 0 birds were infected by the nasal route (Fig. 2A) whilst in the other the susceptible Line C-B12 birds were infected (Fig. 2C), in each case leaving the alternate line birds as uninfected sentinels (Fig. 2B,D). Infected Line 0 birds showed the characteristic oropharyngeal shedding profile, with no virus seen in cloacal swabs (Fig. 2A). None of the C-B12 sentinels produced positive swabs (Fig. 2B). In the second isolator, Line C-B12 birds shed virus by oropharyngeal and cloacal routes with the time-course previously described (Fig. 2C). All of the resistant contact Line 0 birds shed virus from the oropharynx followed, in 6/10 birds, by cloacal shedding, although this was always significantly lower than with infected C-B12 birds and over a shorter duration (Fig. 2D). 4/10 contact Line 0 birds failed to shed from the cloaca (data not shown).

Using either AIV infected syngeneic Antigen Presenting Cells (Fig. 3A) or whole inactivated virus (Fig. 3B) as recall stimulation, IFN\u03b3 responses were detected in birds of both lines after infection. At all time-points, the responses of the samples from Line C-B12 birds were higher than Line 0 birds. At day 7 postinfection, IFN responses were larger for C-B12 birds under syngeneic stimulation (930.9 \u00b1 29.3 vs. 402.0 \u00b1 94.2 Spot Forming Units, SFU/106 splenocytes, p = 0.0079) or whole virus (481.3 \u00b1 114.6 vs. 66.6 \u00b1 23.6 SFU/106 splenocytes, p = 0.0079). Although the values at day 14 decreased with respect to those at day 7, samples from Line C-B12 birds showed higher IFN responses at syngeneic stimulation (398.7 \u00b1 82.8 vs. 104.5 \u00b1 38.6 SFU/106 splenocytes, p = 0.0079) or against whole virus (368.3 \u00b1 49.9 vs. 135.8 \u00b1 62.5 SFU/106 splenocytes, p = 0.0317). We also detected influenza specific antibody IgM and IgY secreting B cells (Fig. 3C,D) in birds of both lines after infection. As with IFN, we found that responses in C-B12 birds tended to be higher than observed in Line 0 at day 7 for IgM (109.4 \u00b1 20.6 vs. 58.0 \u00b1 14.2 SFU/106) and day 14 (95.9 \u00b1 33.1 vs. 32.3 \u00b1 6.4 SFU/106). The number of IgY producing cells also tended to be higher at 7 DPI (131.8 \u00b1 35.9 vs. 77.8 \u00b1 16.0 SFU/106) and 14 DPI (113.2 \u00b1 39.2 vs. 101.0 \u00b1 21.0 SFU/106).

This phenotype was maintained following infection with an historic H9N2 virus but broke down after challenge with a novel H9N2 virus. The Pakistan group of viruses to which this belongs have higher infectivity, virulence and transmission than many LPAI due to polymerases (PB2, PB1 and PA) and non-structural (NS) gene segments identical to highly pathogenic H7N3 viruses2223.

Furthermore, resistant birds were completely unable to initiate or sustain a chain of infection of LPAI, with sentinel birds of either susceptible or resistant genotype showing neither infection nor seroconversion. Our consistent finding was that cloacal shedding of the directly infected birds is the main contributor to sustain a chain of transmission (Figs 1, 2 and 6). Indeed, this is the first experimental evidence of the irrelevance of oropharyngeal shedding to transmission of a particular influenza strain in intimately co-housed birds, with previous literature mostly reporting studies relying on a physical separation between infected and sentinel groups24. Housing resistant Line 0 birds with directly infected and shedding C-B12 birds changed their previously observed phenotype by producing a transient low level shedding of virus from the cloaca (Fig. 2D,F). Host factors were clearly still relevant as, unlike with susceptible C-B12 sentinels, not all individuals succumbed to cloacal shedding, and in those birds that were infected this stopped after 5\u20138 days, as compared with over two weeks for the C-B12 sentinels. Although it is possible that the change in phenotype of the resistant birds was due to persistent challenge with a high level of virus from the susceptible birds, an alternate explanation is that this was the result of an alternative route of infection. We demonstrated the possibility that infection can be achieved through the cloaca (Fig. 5), in which case the Line 0 birds reversed the phenotype seen with intra-nasel infection and shed from the cloaca and not the oropharynx, suggesting that the limited shedding trajectories seen in Line 0 birds may be due to a restriction of within-animal transmission of virus. This may be relevant to the natural situation where the virus is known to persist in water25, giving rise to the possibility of infection by cloacal sampling due to the Shaffner reflex26. Infection by an environmental route that selectively allowed cloacal shedding and onward transmission would have a profound effect on the transmission dynamics and persistence of avian influenza viruses in the wild27.",

            "text": "Though the methodology of the present study does not allow for the identification of particular genes or genomic regions that may be responsible for the observed resistance and susceptibility profiles we can infer what elements of immune regulation may be relevant. Firstly, differences in resistance and susceptibility were observed within 2\u20133 days postinfection, too early for an adaptive immune response and indicative of innate factors including innate immune mechanisms. However, although we cannot rule out some degree of cell-autonomous immunity there were no profound differences in viral production in in vitro assays (Fig. 4), suggesting that this early-acting factor, evidenced in vivo, was either present in cells other than the CEF used for our in vitro assays or was mainly exerted by a more complex level of interaction of cellular and soluble-factors. The correlation of cytokine and chemokine gene expression with viral load in influenza infected poultry has previously been described28. We also cannot discard the involvement of other elements triggering the immune response, such as IFN stimulated genes, TLR pathways29 or other genes activated in response to infection30. As differences in development are reflected in gene expression and the strength of host responses at transcriptional level, these factors have been linked with age-dependent susceptibility to infection in birds28. In the present study we also compared infection of 1 week and 3 week old Line 0 birds. However, we found the same viral dynamics and adaptive responses (data not shown) indicating that the expression of relevant host factors are independent of the host development, at least in perinatal birds.",

Since Line 0 and C-B12 differ in their MHC haplotype, being B21 and B12 respectively, we hypothesised that adaptive responses might also be important with respect to susceptibility to infection with LPAI. However, our observations that the magnitude of adaptive response (given by IFN\u03b3 secreting cells, antibody specific clones or total influenza antibody in serum) correlates with the amount of, rather than resistance to, infection would indicate that adaptive responses may not play a significant role in the shedding/non-shedding phenotype. We cannot entirely exclude the possibility that qualitative differences in, for example, the binding capacity of MHC for specific protective viral-derived peptides may be relevant. There are also other, non-adaptive, immune mechanisms encoded within the avian MHC, including a number of chicken NK receptor genes. Polymorphic and diverse, these genes are involved in the activation or inhibition of chicken NK cells343536. Since these cells have been considered a factor involved in avian influenza pathogenicity37, and that a principal activating natural killer cell receptor has been described as critical in the in vivo eradication of the influenza virus38, the importance of the B-region haplotype in relation with the NK function could be crucial. It is also possible that a hierarchy of interaction exists between the haplotype-specific NK receptors, with some haplotypes being better than others for resistance to pathogens because of increased activity of NK cells1539. It will be important to investigate resistance and susceptibility to influenza in relation the NK activity of different haplotypes.",
