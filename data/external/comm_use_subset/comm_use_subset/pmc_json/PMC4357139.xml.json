Porcine parvovirus (PPV) characterized as a member of the autonomous parvoviruses is one of main pathogens that could cause reproductive failure in pregnant sows, which is characterized by fetal and embryonic death, stillbirths, mummification, and delayed return to oestrus [2]. Although the acute infection of postnatal and nonpregnant pigs is often subclinical, PPV has been linked to interstitial nephritis in slaughter aged pigs [3], skin lesion occurrence in piglets [4], and nonsuppurative myocarditis in lactating piglets. Recently, PPV has gained attention as an agent able to potentiate the effects of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection in the clinical course on postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, a worldwide significant economical disease [5]. Besides its association with the pathological conditions and abovementioned clinical, vaccination with inactivated PPV is generally considered to offer good protection against PPV and is used to control reproductive failure due to PPV. Several inactivated aluminum hydroxide adjuvant vaccines for PPV immunoprophylaxis are available in the United States and oil emulsion adjuvant vaccine of PPV is licensed by veterinary drug standard of the People's Republic of China.",

Some CHMs or CHMIs such as isatidis radix, angelica polysaccharides, and astragalus polysaccharides which were isolated from Isatis indigotica Fort., Angelica sinensis (Olive.) Diels, and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.), respectively, have been developed into antiviral or antibacterial agents [7]. On the one hand, many researches demonstrated that CHMs or CHMIs contain many antiviral active materials, but many active materials had still not been discovered. On the other hand, CHMs or CHMIs possess many biological activities, such as inhibiting viral processes (adsorption, transcription, replication, and release), adjusting immunologic function, and antioxidant, which shows dependable biological functions with light side effects and little toxicity [8]. Moreover, new virus or variant strains of old virus arise continually. So, antiviral drug screened from CHMs became a hotspot for many investigators.",

            "text": "Propolis, applied empirically as a traditional cure in folk medicine for centuries, is a mixture formed by honeybees with various plants resinous and their mandibular gland secretion. Propolis is rich in biochemical constituents, and more than 300 compounds have been identified in it. Flavone is one of the most important pharmacologically active constituents in propolis and is thought to be responsible for many of its biological and pharmacological activities. It is well known for valuable health benefit and is reported to possess reliably biological activities, including antivirus, immune enhancement, antioxidation, antibiosis, hepatoprotection, anticancer, and antifatigue [9\u201311]. It is an excellent immune system booster and natural antibiotic with no side effects. Recently, propolis has become an issue of increasing interest among the investigators owing to its versatile biological activities. Due to these biological activities, propolis has been broadly marketed as the health-food and alternative medicine in various parts of the world. Propolis flavone (PF), a kind of ingredient extracted from propolis, as a harmless natural adjuvant and antivirus has been used in chickens vaccinated with activated or inactivated vaccine. Many studies all proved that PF could improve the immune-enhancing activity in the cellular and humoral immune response [9]. In addition, our previous study also demonstrated that the adjuvant effects and feature of PF on inactivated PPV vaccine to guinea pigs had been considered successfully in cellular and humoral immunity [12].",

Serum dilutions ranged from 1 : 2 to 1 : 2048 and were joined into 96-well V-shaped bottom microtiter plate. The serum-antigen mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. 50 microlitres of 1% rooster erythrocytes suspension was joined into each well and reincubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. A negative serum, a positive serum, antigens, and erythrocytes were also included. The highest serum dilution causing completely inhibition was regarded as the endpoint. The geometric mean titer was marked as reciprocal log2 values of the highest HI antibody titer dilution.",

Its detection principle is that the exogenous MTT could be reduced to water-insoluble violet crystal (Formazan) by the succinate dehydrogenase in living cells and then deposited in cells. But the death cells do not have this function. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can dissolve the formazan in cells; the cell absorbance value (A\n570 value) could indirectly reflect the number of living cells. Within the scope of a certain number of cells, the content of crystal is proportional to the number of living cells. Therefore, the larger A\n570 value is, the more live cells are [16]. Experiment in vitro designed three drug-adding patterns, and those are, respectively, corresponding to prevention, sterilization, and treatment of three clinical administrations. In the present experiment, the A\n570 values of the NPF at most concentrations were significantly higher than those of PF and virus control groups in three adding modes. These results suggested that NPF could effectively inhibit PPV from infecting PK-15 cell in vitro, and the preventative effect was better than those of the sterilization and treatment. The reasons may be that the particle size of NPF is small and quite homogeneous, so it is more advantageous in penetrating cell membrane and being absorbed by cell. When the NPF enters into the organism, it can decelerate the drug release and lengthen the action time of drug in organism by preventing the drug from degrading rapidly. Many other researches in vivo also confirmed that the efficacy of drug after nanocrystallization was significantly better than conventional drug [17], which was consistent with this experimental result.",

            "text": "In the clinical samples of PPV infectious pigs, PPV was often detected in tissues of lymph nodes, lungs [15, 18]. Guinea pigs is a model animal to discuss the immunity or immune response of PPV vaccine [19]. In this experiment in vivo, the PPV content in tissues of lung, gonad, spleen, liver, and blood was measured after challenge. The PPV mainly propagated in gonad, lung, and blood. And at high and middle dose, the PPV content in NPF group was significantly lower than this of the corresponding PF and CC group in tissues of lung, gonad, spleen, and blood. The results suggested that NPF could effectively inhibit PPV infecting tissue of lung and gonad. Gonad is the key organ for PPV replication. NPF could significantly restrain PPV infecting gonad, so NPF was able to effectively alleviate the PPV on reproductive failure and reduce economically the loss in clinical.",

[20] also confirmed that PF, designed to microemulsion, was able to significantly increase the thymus and spleen indices and enhance the contents of IgM and IgG in serum. IgM plays an important role in initial stage of anti-infection immunity and is originally produced in the first humoral immune response [21]. IgG possesses high content and long duration and is the primary antibodies for anti-infection immunity [22].",

IL-2 is a cytokines secreted by type 1 helper T cells (Th1 cells) and able to mediate cellular immunity. IL-2 is also able to promote production of immunoglobulins and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of natural killer cells and is indispensable for the T-cell immunologic memory [23]. IL-6 is secreted by type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) and able to coordinate humoral immunity, which is the cytokine most frequently used to detect the antigen specificity of Th2 T cells. \u03b3-IFN also is secreted by Th1 cells; it can reflect the basic status of cellular immunity and humoral immunity of organism to certain extent.",
