A recent meta-analysis of observational studies of passive immunotherapy in SARS and severe influenza suggest reductions in mortality with timely use of convalescent blood products, particularly those with neutralizing antibodies [11]. Public Health England and the International Severe Acute Respiratory & Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) have published a decision-support tool for clinicians managing cases of MERS-CoV infection [12], which relies heavily upon expert opinion and clinical experience of treating patients with severe respiratory disease caused by other viruses including SARS and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm09).

Such a study will require laboratory ability to diagnose MERS-CoV infection and identify antibody titers among previously infected but recovered patients, research infrastructure and ability to lead or participate in an RCT, and the presence of personal and community equipoise among healthcare workers and patients to enroll in such a trial. Therefore, as part of a collaborative effort among colleagues from the Gulf States and Eastern Mediterranean and with the support of the World Health Organization and International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, we undertook a survey to assess feasibility of conducting a clinical trial of convalescent plasma therapy for patients with MERS-CoV infection in KSA.",

Omitting questions that were deemed not relevant to this study, and modifying or adding questions that were more appropriate to the current objectives led to a questionnaire of 26 items, divided into three main domains of interest. First, four questions aimed to evaluate the ability and capacity of caring for critically ill patients within the KSA health system (e.g., \u201cHow many beds are capable of caring for mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU where patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) would usually be treated?\u201d). Second, the study sought to explore laboratory capacity to diagnose MERS-CoV infection and Blood Bank ability to prepare convalescent plasma through seven questions (e.g., \u201cDo you have a mechanism to send specific blood donors (e.g., survivors of MERS-CoV infection) to the blood bank to make donations?\u201d and \u201cWhat methodologies are available in the laboratories associated with your site for MERS-coV testing?\u201d). The third domain aimed to evaluate research capacity needed to conduct clinical trials and whether or not necessary infrastructure to conduct RCTs existed in KSA, through 10 questions specifically related to research (e.g., \u201cDo you believe that patients at your hospital would participate in randomized studies in which patients are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatments?\u201d). The questionnaire was populated using Survey Monkey, was emailed through the snowball methodology, to physicians who are possibly involved in the care of MERS-CoV patients. Snowball sampling is a chain referral sampling where the initial participants are asked to assist in recruiting more subjects by passing on the questionnaire. We initiated contact with 250 participants from 48 hospitals in Saudi Arabia; those in turn invited others, with a total subjects approached being approximately 582. There were three reminders, 2 weeks apart by email to non-respondents, and the data was collected between March and May 2014. A complete list of the survey questions is included in the online supplement (Additional file 1). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (RC14/003/R--29 April 2015) approved this study. The first question of the survey was a question about whether the participant consents to the survey.",
