Analysis by multiple laboratories has resulted in several competing models for FV biogenesis during the ring stage. These include 1) The \u201cbig gulp model\u201d, which suggests that the first step in the FV biogenesis is an initial uptake of a single large parcel of haemoglobin followed by a continuous uptake of packages mediated by cytostomes that fuse, vesicle-like, with the FV. An additional contribution of endocytosis is not excluded from this model [5]. 2) The \u201ctubus model\u201d prefers the contribution of cytostomes in the uptake of haemoglobin as well, yet in contrast to the previous model this theory is vesicle-independent. In this model, the cytostomes do not initially pinch-off but form elongated tubes that eventually fuse with the FV. The tubes would initially enable the uptake of haemoglobin through contact with the cytostome, and then later deliver haemoglobin to the FV after pinching off and fusing with the FV [6]. 3) The \u201cpre-FV model\u201d is based on the observation that in early intra-erythrocytic life stages multiple enclosed compartments, called pre-FV compartments, are detectable in which haemoglobin degradation has already started [7]. In late ring stages these smaller compartments fuse and give rise to the FV in early trophozoite stages. Vesicles derived from the cytostomal invagination are delivered to the FV to continue supplying the organelle with haemoglobin [7].",

The protein component of haemoglobin is catabolised via series of peptidases [8], [9], [10] but this degradation releases ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) which cannot be degraded by the malarial parasite and is toxic. Instead, Plasmodium parasites polymerise FP to crystalline haemozoin that becomes a distinct feature of the FV of trophozoite and schizont parasites [11], [12], [13]. The crucial process of FP polymerisation is the target of important antimalarial drugs. The best understood of these inhibitory processes is that of chloroquine (CQ), which accumulates in the FV and there inhibits the polymerisation of haem into haemozoin, either by binding free FP [14], or by capping FP polymers [15]. This results in accumulation of toxic unpolymerised FP and toxic FP-CQ complexes, although there is ongoing discussion of exactly how these compounds mediate parasite death [16], [17].",

            "text": "Chloroquine enters parasites in a neutral form that is believed to diffuse across the food vacuole membrane, but inside the acidic environment it is protonated and, once charged, is unable to freely diffuse out of the FV again. This leads to an accumulation of chloroquine inside the food vacuole, relative to the rest of the parasite and the external milieu. Chloroquine resistant parasites accumulate considerably less CQ in their FV relative to sensitive parasites [18], [19], [20], [21]. The difference in accumulation is attributable to mutations in the FV membrane protein PfCRT (PF3D7_0709000), particularly a substitution of K to T at residue 76 [22] and to a lesser degree, changes in the FV membrane protein PfMDR1 (PF3D7_0523000) [23], [24]. The means by which PfCRT modulates FV chloroquine concentration has been much debated, and some authors have suggested that a difference in the pH of the FV between sensitive and resistant parasites modified the accumulation of drug (eg [25]). However, more recent studies indicate that sensitive and resistant parasites do not have significantly different FV acidity [26], but that the modified PfCRT in CQ resistant parasites directly facilitates a leak of chloroquine out of the FV [27], [28], [29], [30]. These data indicate that mutations in PfCRT allow charged CQ to escape from the FV, and that its efflux decreases the concentration of CQ in the FV to non-lethal levels. Despite its clear association with resistance, it remains unclear whether PfCRT mutations are sufficient to generate chloroquine resistance in the field. In many chloroquine resistant isolates, polymorphisms are also found in PfMDR1 and other transporters [31], and regulatory changes in assorted other genes have been associated with compensation for the resistance mutations in PfCRT [32]. Even in isogenic lines, transfected parasites take several weeks to reach population levels that allow drug assays to be performed, potentially allowing lines to compensate for PfCRT changes through secondary trans mutations or epigenetic regulatory changes. To circumvent the necessarily long delay between transfection and analysis of transgenic parasites, and to characterise the direct effect of PfCRT mutations, we generated isogenic parasites lines with anhydrotetracycline-regulatable expression of PfCRT-GFP fusions, using pfcrt alleles from sensitive (PfCRTS) and resistant parasites (PfCRTR).",

            "text": "Inducible expression of PfCRT-GFP fusions also allows us to further characterise the trafficking of PfCRT to the FV membrane. Our knowledge about the targeting of proteins towards the FV has until recently been restricted to lumenal proteases participating in haemoglobin degradation, such as Plasmepsin II and DPAP1. The FV lumenal peptidase Plasmepsin II is targeted via the parasite plasma membrane (PM) to the FV as an integral membrane protein in a Brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive manner [8], whereas the soluble DPAP1 is first transported through the PM, accumulating in the Parasitophorous vacuole (PV), followed by the final transport step to the FV [8]. Recently the first study of targeting for PfCRT was published, demonstrating that PfCRT traffic to the FV membrane is via the ER, is Brefeldin A sensitive, and that subsequent direction to the FVM depends on a small region at the C-terminus that includes a potentially phosphorylated threonine (position 416) [33]. The key PfCRT mutation associated with chloroquine resistance, K76T, is positioned at the boundary of the protein's first transmembrane domain (TMD), and the length and composition of a protein's initial transmembrane length is a trafficking determinant in other endomembrane proteins [34], [35], [36]. We therefore examined whether the change of charge at the transmembrane boundary of PfCRT affected the sub-cellular localisation and thus function of the CQ-resistant form.",

We show that both PfCRT forms are identically localised at the FV membrane, and that differential subcellular localisation is therefore not a cause of differential chloroquine sensitivity. We also show that PfCRT trafficking is inhibited by Dynasore, an inhibitor of dynamin-mediated vesicle formation, consistent with a role for dynamin in FV biogenesis. The inducible GFP-tagged PfCRT also provides an excellent tool to follow the biogenesis of the FV development. We show the existence of a PfCRT enveloped organelle prior to the appearance of haemozoin, the traditional definition of the appearance of FV.",

For this, P. falciparum gDNA was PCR amplified with the oligonucleotides PF0344-5\u2032F (cggcttaagGTTGTTTTTCTCTTTG-TGGTCAAAATAAG) and PF0344-5\u2032R (gctaatattattattctcatctcgagTTTTTTTTTTT-TTTTAAATGTTGAATTATAAAC), and the resulting 1.55 kb product was digested with AflII and XhoI and then filled in with Klenow. This fragment was subsequently cloned into the XmaI/BstB1 sites of pTMSP2HA that had also been filled in with Klenow. The 2xHA epitope tag of pT150HA was then replaced with GFP to create pT150GFP.

Parasites of each population were dispensed to a final parasitaemia of 0.5% in triplicate to a 96-well tissue culture plate prepared with varying CQ concentration, 2% haematocrit, 10 \u00b5M selective agent WR99210 and in the case of uninduced parasites, 0.5 \u00b5g/mL ATc in a total volume of 200 \u00b5L. For relevant experiments, parasites were also cultured in 5 \u00b5M verapamil. Parasite growth of induced and uninduced parasites was also measured in the absence of CQ (positive control), and uninfected erythrocytes cultured in the absence of CQ, WR99210 and ATc provided the background level of fluorescence (negative control). Parasites were cultured for 48 h under optimal culturing conditions. Following the 48 h incubation period, CQ-treated parasites were washed, added to a new 96-well tissue culture plate containing SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.008% (w/v) saponin, 0.08% (w/v) Triton X-100) and incubated for 1 h at RT. Fluorescence, with excitation and emission wavelength centred at 485 nm and 530 nm respectively, was examined using a ThermoScientific Varioskan Flash Microplate Reader. Experiments were conducted in triplicate, and each such experiment was performed independently five times.",

We took advantage of the TATi3 transactivator system established by Meissner and colleagues that allows repression of expression by addition of ATc [44]. The original ATc-regulatable plasmid expressed the transactivator under the control of the promoter of PfMSP2 (PF3D7_0206800) [44], a gene with a temporal transcription peak in schizont stage parasites. To mimic the temporal expression of PfCRT we modified the TATI3 vector by replacing the PfMSP2 with the promoter of PfPTEX150 (PF3D7_1436300), a gene with very similar expression phase and abundance to PfCRT [53], [54]. GFP fusions were generated for the full gene of PfCRT from the chloroquine sensitive line 3D7 and the chloroquine resistant line 7G8, which contains, among other mutations, the K76T replacement (Figure 1A). Western blot analysis using an anti-GFP antibody against mixed parasite showed a band at a height corresponding to motility of \u223c62 kDa products in the induced parasites, but not in uninduced samples (Figure 1B). 62 kDa is slightly smaller than the expected molecular weight of 76 kDa for PfCRT as a GFP fusion but multi-spanning TM proteins regularly migrate more quickly than expected from their apparent mass, and PfCRT alone was previously reported to migrate faster than expected [22]. These analyses validated this expression system for the inducible production and localisation of PfCRTS and PfCRTR (Figure 1C).",

Two independent TMD predictors, MEMSAT [40] and SPLIT4 [41], predicted that the mutations found in the PfCRT proteins of the resistant parasites DD2 or 7G8 (particularly changes at k76) would change the length, position and polar face of the first transmembrane domain (Figure 2A, B, C). Even small differences in TMD composition or length can be enough to mistarget proteins in the early stages of the secretory pathway [34], [35], [42], [55]. We therefore investigated whether the K76 mutations in PfCRT altered trafficking to the FV, which may impact its role in modulating drug resistance.",

We therefore wished to extend these studies by using the PfCRT-GFP fusion as a marker of FV development throughout the asexual intra-erythrocytic life cycle. The first expression of GFP-tagged PfCRTS in induced parasites was detected as a juxta-nuclear dot-like structure in mid to late rings (Figure 3A). In mid ring parasites a dual localisation between the nascent FV and the ER was frequently observed, indicated as a juxta-nuclear puncta structure as well as a fine ring around the nucleus. In late ring stage parasites, the small sphere of fluorescence co-localises with a round spherical body that is visible by light microscopy, yet at this stage still lacks any detectable refractile or dark haemozoin crystal. This indicates that a discrete pre-FV compartment, bearing PfCRT, forms prior to the appearance of haemozoin, which is normally used as a morphological character to define commencement of the trophozoite stage (Figure 3A).",

This second ring structure, if not adjacent to the FV membrane, had no association with the FV whatsoever and seemed to be an independent organellar compartment itself. Haemozoin crystal was also apparent within these secondary FV-like compartments (Figure 3B). In summary, live cell microscopy of PfCRT-GFP parasites reveals the presence of a pre-FV compartment prior to detection of haemozoin crystal.

Previous studies localised PfDYN1(PF3D7_1145400) to the ER and FV, whereas PfDYN2 (PF3D7_1037500) was localised to the ER and Golgi compartment [57], [58] and Dynasore treatment was reported to disrupt the integrity of the FV, producing a fragmented organelle [50]. We treated malarial parasites expressing GFP-tagged PfCRTS for 2 h with a concentration of 40 \u00b5M, a concentration reported to reduce GTPase activity of both dynamin-like enzymes by approximately 50%, but which enabled the parasites to develop to later stages [50], whereas a concentration at 80 \u00b5M completely inhibited the development of the parasites. Analysis of parasites cultured longer than 2 h in the presence of Dynasore did not show any clear differences in morphology and labelling pattern compared to the 2 h treatment (data not shown). Fluorescence in parasites treated with Dynasore was somewhat lower, indicative of some toxicity, as seen with BFA. Immunofluorescence showed that while there was GFP at the FV membrane, there was also an increased accumulation of PfCRTS-GFP around the nucleus in the treated parasites, corresponding to ER localisation (Figure 4C). Some dynasore-treated parasites showed a pattern of PfCRTS that did not perfectly co-localise with the FV but which formed a long string-form associated with the exterior of the FV without embracing the whole FV as in the untreated parasites. These data indicate that the trafficking of PfCRT is via the ER and not only involves BFA-sensitive processes, as previously shown [33], but also the action of dynamin-like proteins.",

These parasites each possessed two separate PfCRT proteins \u2013 the unmodified genomic copy of PfCRTS in the 3D7 line, as well as the GFP-fusion of either PfCRTS (from 3D7) or PfCRTR (from 7G8). Because episomes are poorly segregated in P. falciparum, some parasites in any generation of a transfected line do not express the desired product. In addition, the inducible system is imperfect, and only a small number of parasites strongly express the induced protein, as found in previous implementations of this system [44]. Moreover, expression of the PfCRT-GFP fusion became considerably weaker several cycles after induction, precluding longer-term experiments, or establishment of parasites stably expressing the fusion protein. The reason for this is unclear, but may relate to toxicity of longer expression of the PfCRT-GFP fusions. These variables meant that it was important to carefully measure the number of parasites expressing the PfCRT-GFP fusion in each line during the drug sensitivity assays, and to perform the drug sensitivity assays as soon as possible after induction. After fusion protein induction by removal of the transcription inhibitor ATc from sorbitol-synchronised ring stages, parasites were allowed to over-express PfCRTS-GFP or PfCRTR-GFP until the next ring stage after synchronisation, at which point the CQ drug assay was commenced. To assess consistency of PfCRT-GFP fusion expression, fluorescence (of induced parasites) was monitored and the percentage of GFP-expressing parasites determined in separate plates a further 12 hours later. On average 7.7\u00b10.4% and 8.3\u00b10.8% of parasites were fluorescent in the PfCRTS-GFP and PfCRTR-GFP lines, respectively. This result confirmed the consistency of the inducible expression system and additionally demonstrated comparable proportions of over-expressing parasites in the two independent populations after ATc removal.",

From a total of five independent experiments, each with three internal replicates, the IC50 value for 3D7 wild-type parasites using this experimental method was on average 18.9\u00b13.8 nM, and W2mef parasites had an IC50 for chloroquine of 295.3\u00b121.0. (Table 1) These IC50 values are consistent with 48 hour IC50s previously reported for these strains [59], [60]. Parasites transfected with the PfCRT-GFP plasmids but with transgene expression repressed by maintenance on ATc showed no significant difference in the IC50 compared to 3D7 (t-test p>0.05). No significant difference in chloroquine sensitivity was observed between these parasites and parasites expressing either PfCRTR-GFP or PfCRTS-GFP (t-test p>0.05). Verapamil, a chloroquine-resistance reversing agent, restored much of the CQ sensitivity of the CQ-resistant W2mef, but had no discernible effect on the CQ sensitivity of the PfCRTR-GFP or PfCRTS-GFP expressing lines (Table 1) (t-test p>0.05). We conclude, therefore, that these fusion proteins either have no impact on chloroquine resistance, or a sufficiently mild effect that our drug-response assay is unable to detect it.",

For proteins in the endomembrane system, the composition and length of the transmembrane domains, particularly the initial membrane-spanning domain, can partially determine their subcellular localisation [34], [35], [36], [42], [55], [65]. Changes that result in mis-targeting include mutations that alter the length of a transmembrane domain [35], or which add or remove a polar face to a transmembrane domain (eg [42]) (Figure 2C). Specific transmembrane domains have also been shown to be instrumental in trafficking in Plasmodium falciparum\n[66], [67]. The major resistance determining mutation in PfCRT is at the end of the first predicted transmembrane domain [22], and multiple additional mutations are found in other transmembrane domains of PfCRT that modulate resistance to chloroquine and other quinolone drugs [62]. Bioinformatic interrogation of these mutations suggest that they may alter the position and length of the initial transmembrane domain (Figure 2). We therefore tested whether changes in these transmembrane domains may modulate resistance to Plasmodium by changing the subcellular localisation of PfCRT \u2013 potentially altering subcellular distribution of chloroquine by changing relative amounts of the transporter on the food vacuole, plasma membrane or ER/Golgi. Our examination of identically-prepared GFP fusions of resistant and sensitive forms of PfCRT conclusively falsifies this hypothesis \u2013 there was no difference in abundance or localisation between the two forms, and both were exclusively intracellularly localised, with no detectable fraction at the plasma membrane.",

Kuhn and colleagues have previously demonstrated that PfCRT traffic to the FV membrane is via the ER/Golgi using a combination of genetic deletion experiments and treatment of parasites with the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA) [33]. BFA interferes with early targeting events between ER and Golgi level by inhibiting the function of guanine nucleotide-exchange (GEP) proteins that regulate the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins [69], [70]. Arf proteins are involved in a wide range of functions, including regulation of ER and Golgi function and morphology, ER-to-Golgi transport, and recruitment of COP and adaptor protein complex proteins (reviewed in [71]). We also examined the BFA sensitivity of the inducibly expressed PfCRT-GFP fusion, and found that BFA produced a defect in traffic from the ER/Golgi to the FV membrane, consistent with a trafficking route via the ER/Golgi (Figure 4). One means of trafficking vesicles from the ER and Golgi is through dynamin and dynamin-like GTPase-mediated vesicle budding [72], [73], [74], [75]. Plasmodium has several dynamin-like proteins, some likely involved in organelle division and endocytosis, and others potentially involved in vesicle budding [58], [76], [77]. One of these dynamin homologues \u2013 PfDYN1 localised to multiple cellular destinations including the FV and the ER [58], while another, PfDYN2 was reported to localise to the ER, Golgi compartment and the relict plastid [57]. Roles for dynamin-like GTPases in Plasmodium have been interrogated using Dynasore, a non-competitive inhibitor that acts on the dynamin GTPase domain [78]. Dynasore has been reported to produce a dramatic effect on Plasmodium endocytosis and haemoglobin uptake, as well disrupting leading to profound fragmentation of the FV [50].",

In contrast to a previous study [50], we saw no widespread morphological defects of the FV, assayed by live cell imaging of parasite with the FV membrane highlighted by PfCRTS-GFP labelling (figure 4C). In our experiments the FV was intact and not fragmented. We did however see some disruption of PfCRTS-GFP targeting, with an increase of fluorescence around the nuclei, corresponding to ER localisation (figure 4C). This suggests that dynamin-like proteins may be involved in the trafficking of proteins from the ER/Golgi to the FV, potentially through its action in completing budding of vesicles. These data also independently support the model of an ER-mediated trafficking mechanism for FV membrane proteins.",

Abu Bakar and colleagues showed the existence of various small pre-FV compartments that fuse together to form a central FV compartment [7].

Instead, these smaller PfCRT-GFP compartments share more similarities with long-lived extra-FV compartments described by Abu Bakar and colleagues [7]. It is unclear if these secondary compartments derive from parcels of haemoglobin from the cytostomal invagination that have already recruited PfCRT but have fail to fuse with the existing FV membrane, or if they result from the pinching-off of a part of the FV resulting in a second FV-like compartment.",

            "text": "Despite the clear causal relationship between mutations in PfCRT and chloroquine resistance, the role of additional genetic and epigenetic factors in the acquisition of chloroquine remains unclear. This is partly because other lines expressing transgenic PfCRT [22] or with PfCRT allelic exchanges [63], [83] have had weeks of growth at least to compensate for any negative effects of the mutant PfCRT [32]. We attempted to study whether sudden expression of mutant, chloroquine resistant PfCRT in a sensitive background was sufficient to bestow chloroquine resistance by using the repressible ATc expression system. However, the IC50 values obtained for CQ sensitive 3D7 parasites over-expressing either PfCRTS-GFP or PfCRTR-GFP showed no significant difference. Several factors make these results difficult to interpret - the first is that only a small percentage (only \u223c8\u201310%) of cells expressed the fusion proteins after induction in either cell lines. This effect has been seen before for ATc-regulatable systems in apicomplexan parasites [44], and in our system meant that a large number of the parasites being assayed were in fact parental population, and any phenotypic signal emanating from the induced parasites would have been weakened by the background signal from the non-expressing parasites. Nevertheless, the gap in drug sensitivity between strongly drug resistant and sensitive lines is sufficient that substantial differences should still have been apparent as a changed IC50 even in a mixed population. Another possible confounding factor is that the GFP fusion to PfCRT may prevent these from functioning as transporters, or may inhibit their interaction with chloroquine. We had initially intended to study inducibly over-expressed PfCRT forms without the GFP fusion to investigate this effect. However, the very low levels of parasites expressing after induction) meant such an experiment would have been unreliable without a marker for the PfCRT overexpression. Some PfCRT antibodies are available, but none were reliably specific in our hands.",

(B) Western Blot analysis of induced over-expression of sensitive (PfCRTS) and resistant (PfCRTR) form of PfCRT as GFP-fusion. Presence of PfCRTS and PfCRTR as GFP-fusions, labelled with mouse anti-GFP, is confirmed by the presence of a band at 62 kDa only in the parasites cultured in the absence of ATc. P. falciparum wild-type strain 3D7 represents the negative control. Labelling with rabbit anti-GAPDH shows equal loading in these lanes. (C) Fluorescence microscopy of GFP-fusions of sensitive (PfCRTS, top) and resistant (PfCRTR, bottom) form of PfCRT. PfCRTS and PfCRTR were over-expressed as GFP-fusion proteins using an ATc-inducible expression system. Live cell images of DAPI-stained infected red blood cells show that both forms of PfCRT localise to the FV membrane. Later stages of the asexual life cycle show ring/dot-like structures (white arrow) within the FV, possibly degraded GFP-fusion proteins.",

The amino acids are represented according to their hydrophobicity (hydrophilic residue (blue), hydrophobic residue (red), intermediate stages (dark red, violet)). The mutation at position 76 represents a replacement of a positively charged, hydrophilic residue (lysine, K) with an uncharged, hydrophobic (threonine, T) residue. (B) Predicted length of the first TMD of sensitive and various resistant alleles of PfCRT using different bioinformatic predictors. Single point mutations at position 76 [22], [63] were analysed using three different TM prediction applications, i.e. TMHMM2 [39], Memsat [40] and Split4 [41]. Following the TM prediction the predicted length and position of the first TMD of PfCRT were extracted and analysed. In contrast to TMHMM2, the predictors Memsat and Split predict a change in both length and position due to a single point mutation at position 76. (C) Helical wheel projection of the first TMD of Glycoprotein M (left) and PfCRT (right). Yellow residues are nonpolar; green residues are polar, uncharged; blue residues are basic. The first TMD of the infectious bronchitis virus Glycoprotein M consists of a polar face (black square around the involved residues) within its first TMD that becomes obvious when represented in a helical wheel projection (modified from [42]). Point mutations that modified the polar face of the TMD resulted in a mistargeting of the viral Glycoprotein M [42]. Helical wheel projection of the first TMD of PfCRT reveals a change in the polar face as a result of mutations at position 76 (modified from [62]).",

The earliest detectable and distinct localisation of PfCRT-GFP was observed in mid ring stage parasites, co-localising with a round spherical shape in proximity to the DAPI-stained nucleus. The characteristic dark haemozoin crystal was not yet visible in these parasites. In addition to FV labelling, some fluorescence was detectable at the ER. PfCRT-GFP labelling of the FV membrane was observed throughout the whole intra-erythrocytic life cycle. In accordance with an increase of the haemozoin crystal, the ring-like labelling of the FV membrane expanded as the parasite grew. An unexpected second PfCRT-GFP-labelled sphere was observed in schizont stage parasites. In some parasites this additional structure was associated/attached to the FV membrane (lower schizont panel). (B) An overlay with the corresponding brightfield (BF) image shows that in some parasites the additional PfCRT-GFP enclosed compartment (white arrow) is separate from the FV and surrounds a dark structure, possibly haemozoin.",

As a control a second parasite population was treated with an equivalent volume of carrier alone (ethanol and DMSO, respectively). Following the BFA treatment, immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on fixed cells with mouse anti-GFP, Alexa-594 goat anti-mouse IgG and DAPI. Representative parasites in trophozoite and schizont stage are shown for control and treated parasites. (A) The control parasites show the restricted FV localisation of PfCRT-GFP (false-coloured in green). (B) BFA treated parasites show an accumulation of fluorescence around the DAPI-stained nuclei, consistent with ER localisation in addition to the FV localisation (Figure 1).
