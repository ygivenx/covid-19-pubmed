            "text": "IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 are structurally related cytokines of the type I interferon family which mediate an early innate immune response to viral infections. There are 13 distinct IFN-\u03b1 genes present in the human genome, and a single gene encoding for IFN-\u03b2. These genes are transcriptionally activated in cells sensing a virus infection through pattern recognition receptors such as the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) helicase. Following secretion, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 act similarly by binding to a common, ubiquitously expressed IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor resulting in the activation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway and transcription of \u201cIFN-induced genes\u201d [1], [2]. Several of these genes encode for proteins with strong antiviral activity, i.e. Mx protein, protein kinase R, and 2\u2032-5\u2032oligo(A) synthetase [3]. Due to their autocrine action, type I IFN may attenuate virus replication in infected cells. Probably more important is the paracrine action of type I IFN, which induces an antiviral state in previously uninfected cells, thereby blocking virus dissemination in the organism. In addition to this \u201cclassical\u201d antiviral function, type I IFNs are known to affect cell proliferation and differentiation, to modulate the immune response, to inhibit angiogenesis, and to promote apoptosis [4], [5]. Genetically engineered type I IFNs are currently in clinical use for the treatment of multiple sclerosis [6], chronic hepatitis C virus infection [7], and certain types of cancer [8], [9]. An issue of increasing importance is the determination of neutralizing antibodies that are induced in some patients following recombinant IFN therapy [10].",

            "text": "The accurate determination of antiviral IFN activity is a cumbersome issue. In the \u201cclassical\u201d bioassay, serial dilutions of both a test sample with unknown IFN activity and a type I IFN standard are incubated with an appropriate cell line prior to infection with a cytolytic virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), encephalomyocarditis virus, or Sendai virus [14], [15]. The reciprocal value of the highest type I IFN dilution mediating protection of 50% of the cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) is defined as one unit of type I IFN per volume. This classical IFN bioassay is time-consuming because the CPE normally needs 24 hours or more to develop. A faster readout can be achieved with recombinant viruses expressing reporter proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase [16], [17], [18], [19]. However, any work with live virus requires appropriate biosafety containment. For example, a recently published IFN bioassay can only be performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, because the test makes use of a recombinant Rift Valley Fever virus [19]. Viral replicon-based bioassays that take advantage of disabled propagation-incompetent viruses may provide an attractive alternative to live virus-based bioassays. A human hepatoma cell line harbouring a selectable hepatitis C virus replicon has been successfully employed for the measurement of type I IFN from patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection [20]. However, as type I IFNs act in a species-dependent manner, this system may not be applicable to animal IFNs. Transgenic cell lines expressing a reporter gene under control of an IFN-responsive promoter may also be used to determine IFN activity under biosafe conditions [21], [22]. However, it is difficult to simply relate transcriptional reporter gene activation to antiviral activity.",

The cells were further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours in the presence of 10\u22129 M mifepristone. The cell culture supernatant was clarified by low-speed centrifugation and passed through a 0.20-\u00b5m-pore size filter to deplete vaccinia virus. VSV*\u0394G(Luc) was further propagated on mifepristone-induced BHK-G43 cells and stored frozen at \u221270\u00b0C. To determine infectious virus titers, confluent BHK-21 grown in 96-well microtiter plates were inoculated in duplicate with 40 \u00b5l of serial tenfold virus dilutions for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The wells additionally received 60 \u00b5l of EMEM and were incubated for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. The infectious titers were calculated according to the number of GFP-expressing cells/well and expressed as fluorescence-forming units per milliliter (ffu/ml).",

In the present work, this vector was modified by inserting the firefly luciferase gene into the transcription unit at position 5 (thereby replacing the GFP gene) and exchanging the HA gene with the GFP gene (Fig. 1a). The resulting vector, VSV*\u0394G(Luc), was propagated on BHK-G43 helper cells which express the VSV G protein in an inducible manner [23]. Up to 109 virus replicon particles (VRP) were released into the cell culture supernatant 24 h post infection (data not shown). Several mammalian and avian cells were found to be susceptible to infection with the VRPs in line with previous observations on the very broad cell tropism of VSV [29]. Infected cells were readily detected (5 to 6 h post infection) by means of GFP reporter expression (Fig. 1b). However, non-helper cells were unable to complement the VSV G deletion and thus could not produce infectious progeny virus. Importantly, VSV*\u0394G(Luc) did not induce type I IFN in the cell lines analysed (data not shown). This can be ascribed to the host shut-off activity of the VSV matrix protein [30].",

A dose-dependent effect of IFN-\u03b2 on firefly luciferase reporter activity was observed after 1 hour of incubation (Fig. 2a).

Extending the incubation time to 2 hours did not further improve the sensitivity of the test (p>0.05 for the 0.08 to 1.25 IFN units range). However, if the cells were treated for 20 hours, the dose response curve was significantly shifted to lower IFN units (p\u22640.001 for the 0.02 to 20 units range). Approximately 0.05 units of IFN-\u03b2 were now sufficient to suppress reporter activity by 50%. These results indicate that an IFN\u03b2-induced antiviral state in NHDF cells can be detected as early as 1 hour after addition of IFN-\u03b2, although the sensitivity of the assay is higher if the cells were incubated with IFN-\u03b2 for prolonged time.",

Incubation at higher temperatures (80\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C) affected the activity more drastically, although some activity was still left at these temperatures. Only when human IFN-\u03b2 was heated to 100\u00b0C for 30 min, activity was completely abolished. In contrast to human IFN-\u03b2, porcine IFN-\u03b1 was completely inactivated at 70\u00b0C (p<0.0001), whereas human IFN-\u03bb (IL-29), a type III IFN, showed even higher residual activity at 80\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C (p<0.001), suggesting that these cytokines have different physicochemical properties.",

It turned out that the antiviral activity of human IFN-\u03b2 was not significantly affected by acid (p>0.05) (Fig. 5b), confirming the previously noted acid-stability of type I IFNs [31]. IFN-\u03bb showed similar properties as antiviral activity was maintained following treatment with 0.1 M HCl (Fig. 5c). In contrast, alkaline treatment significantly reduced the activity of IFN-\u03bb (p<0.05 for the 250 \u2212 1 ng/ml range), whereas IFN-\u03b2 was not affected (p>0.05) (Fig. 5b).

In contrast, the bioassay presented here takes advantage of the firefly luciferase reporter, which can be detected with high sensitivity long before a cytopathic effect is apparent. Although the luciferase reporter enabled us to unambiguously quantify the IFN-mediated reduction of virus replication, we frequently observed that the standard deviations for the antiviral activities increased when the cells were treated with low amounts of type I IFN. This likely reflects the high reporter gene expression at low levels of type I IFN and the inaccuracy associated with pipetting small volumes (6 \u00b5l).",

It is common practice that cells are incubated with type I IFN for several hours to induce an antiviral state [15], [19]. Our findings suggest that an antiviral state can be detected much earlier. For example, treatment of NHDF with 1 unit of human IFN-\u03b2 for 1 hour and subsequent infection with VSV*\u0394G(Luc) for 5 hours was sufficient to suppress firefly reporter expression by 50%, even though the effective dose was further lowered with longer incubation times. While DF-1 fibroblasts responded to chicken IFN-\u03b1 with dose response kinetics similar to the one observed with human IFN-\u03b2 on NHDF, PK-15 cells responded to porcine type I IFN in a much slower way. Thus, compared to conventional bioassays VSV*\u0394G(Luc) may allow quantification of type I IFN in a considerably shorter time provided an appropriate cell line has been selected. The selection of a suitable cell line is also important with respect to the species it is derived from, as full activity of type I IFN was only observed with cells from the corresponding species. Since VSV is able to infect a broad spectrum of mammalian and avian cells, the new bioassay may be used to determine the bioactivity of type I IFNs from many different animals.",

Indeed, using the VSV*\u0394G(Luc) replicon assay, it was possible to quantify the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb (Il-29), a type III IFN. This raises the important question of how to distinguish between different antiviral cytokines? Certainly, neutralizing antibodies may be employed to specify the antiviral cytokine present in the sample. In addition, the extraordinary acid-stability of type I IFNs may be used to differentiate them from acid-labile cytokines such as type II IFNs [35]. However, acid may not be used to distinguish between type I and type III IFNs as IFN-\u03bb proved to be acid-stable as well. Since IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b2 was sensitive to 0.1 M NaOH, treatment with alkaline may be used instead. However, the conditions of treatment still have to be optimized to guarantee the complete inactivation of type III IFNs while maintaining the activity of type I IFNs.",
