Ten fragment hits with low-affinity dissociation constants (millimolar range) were identified (Supplementary Fig. 1).

As ester functions are often associated with low biological stability, the first step was to replace the ester function of compound 22, which makes a key hydrogen bond with Arg55, without affecting the cyclophilin inhibitory potency. All designed compounds lacking the ester function lost their interaction with Arg55, resulting in a drastic decrease of cyclophilin inhibition (IC50 >500 \u03bcM). This was the case of compound 23 (Table 1), although this compound retained all of the other key interactions of compound 22 (Supplementary Fig. 6 and https://figshare.com/articles/Stereo_views_of_cocrystal_structures_of_cyclophilin_inhibitors_with_cyclophilin_D/3490493). Based on the observation that in the CypA\u2013SfA complex (PDB code 1YND) the side chain of Arg55 is pushed by an oxygen atom of SfA, a phenyl\u2013pyrrolidine moiety was added to generate compound 24 (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 3d, compound 24 shared the same binding mode as compound 22. In addition, the methoxy of the phenyl\u2013pyrrolidine moiety displaced the side chain of Arg55, making a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety of the urea motif (Fig. 3e and https://figshare.com/articles/Stereo_views_of_cocrystal_structures_of_cyclophilin_inhibitors_with_cyclophilin_D/3490493). Compound 24 proved to be a potent inhibitor of CypA, CypB and CypD PPIase activities, with IC50s of 2.8\u00b10.6, 1.2\u00b10.1 and 11.4\u00b13.0 \u03bcM, respectively.",

The list and structure of the compounds tested for PPIase inhibitory activity is shown in Supplementary Table 1. Among them, only compound 32, in which the aniline motif was replaced by an amino-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl, retained the PPIase inhibitory potency of its parent compound, with IC50s of 7.4\u00b16.8, 8.7\u00b11.5 and 12.8\u00b12.5 \u03bcM for CypA, CypB and CypD, respectively (Table 1). In addition, replacement of compound 31's aniline motif by a 3-amino-pyridine led to the generation of compound 33, which, although less active than its parent compound, retained significant PPIase inhibitory activities, with IC50s of 4.2\u00b11.6, 2.2\u00b11.2 and 7.7\u00b10.8 \u03bcM for CypA, CypB and CypD, respectively (Table 1).",

Notably, the side-chain guanidine group of the essential Arg55 is hydrogen bonded to the prolyl nitrogen of the substrate. It promotes isomerization by weakening the double-bond properties of the peptide bond32. Targeting this residue is thus crucial to achieve potent inhibition of PPIase activity. CsA, its non-immunosuppressive cyclic analogues and SfA are large macrocycle compounds (molecular weight >1,000 g mol\u22121). They bind the cyclophilin catalytic site and potently inhibit PPIase activity33. However, the shortcomings of these families of compounds in clinical practice emphasize the need for the development of small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitors. As the cyclophilin catalytic site is not a buried pocket, the design of small ligands with a molecular weight <500 g mol\u22121 is nevertheless challenging33. A deeper pocket, the \u2018gatekeeper pocket\u2018, has been identified in close vicinity to the PPIase catalytic site10. This pocket could contribute to substrate binding specificity through gatekeeper residues located at its surface that restrict substrate accessibility. Thus, the gatekeeper pocket appears as an interesting target close to the catalytic site, suitable for a fragment-based approach targeting both sites combined with a linking strategy.",

Furthermore, conformational strain and flexibility mean that an energy price often needs to be paid to achieve optimal linking of the fragments34. In spite of these challenges, and because we were targeting two different subpockets, we decided to use this approach to link two fragments binding the catalytic and gatekeeper pockets, respectively, to substantially improve the stability and binding affinity of the resulting molecule. By means of structure-based drug design, we selected a linker consisting of a urea moiety that mimicked key interactions of both CsA and SfA with cyclophilins without altering the binding mode of the two fragments alone. Our results thus show that linking fragments that bind adjacent sites is a powerful approach for complex targets when an optimal linker can be found.",

This led to the generation of compounds 32 and 33 that do not have an aniline motif but retain both anti-PPIase and anti-viral activity. The risk related to the aniline motif must be balanced with the severity of the target disease (cost/benefit ratio) and the required duration of administration. For instance, what would be considered a major safety issue when treating a benign disease requiring long-term administration would be unimportant in case of short-term treatment of a severe, eventually life-threatening acute infection.

We synthesized their two \u2018best' compounds and purchased one of them (TMN-355) from Tocris Bioscience, to test their ability to inhibit PPIase activity, and HCV and coronavirus replication in vitro. As shown in Supplementary Table 3, none of these compounds exhibited any biological activity in the models. Furthermore, we could not obtain any crystallographic structure of the compounds complexed with cyclophilins. In another article in which a closely related compound was tested against enterovirus 71 (ref. 4), in vitro resistance selection experiments identified one amino acid substitution selected after several passages with increasing concentrations of the compound. The substitution conferred a modest fivefold reduction in EV71 susceptibility, but no resistance to CsA, further challenging the hypothesis of a common mechanism of inhibition for the two molecules. Altogether, these results cast doubt as to the reality of the anti-cyclophilin properties of this class of molecules. Other families of compounds have been reported to inhibit cyclophilin activity in vitro, but they need to be externally validated and their potential as broad-spectrum antiviral compounds has not been evaluated383940. These results emphasize the difficulty of developing efficacious small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitors unrelated to CsA or SfA and underline the originality and importance of our work.",

Indeed, several cyclophilins, principally but not only CypA, have been convincingly shown to play a pivotal role in the life cycle of a number of viral families3. Our results showing inhibition of HCV, HIV and HCoV-229E coronavirus by compound 31 and related compounds, together with preliminary data suggesting hepatitis B virus replication inhibition, support the future development of our new family of cyclophilin inhibitors as broad-spectrum antiviral compounds with a high barrier to resistance. The high barrier to resistance, demonstrated with CsA derivatives in HCV infection16, results of the fact that cyclophilin inhibitors do not directly target a viral function but instead target a host protein involved at a key step of the viral life cycle. Thus, the likelihood to select viruses that are resistant to the action of the drug is low and, if such viruses were selected, they would be unlikely to yield high levels of resistance, as already shown27. This was confirmed here by the demonstration that amino acid substitutions in the HCV NS5A protein known to modestly reduce CsA- and CsA-derived inhibitor susceptibility of HCV also very modestly affected HCV susceptibility to the new compounds.",
