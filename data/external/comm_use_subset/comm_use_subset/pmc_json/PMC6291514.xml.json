            "text": "Vaccines are the most effective and also affordable disease-prevention tools (1) and maternal antibodies protect the offspring from infections in man (2) and animals (3). In cattle, pre-partum vaccination with various virulence factors of bacterial or viral infectious diseases is a standard procedure which effectively stimulates the production of specific antibodies (4, 5). A novel production technology using an allogeneic cell line (6) and the addition of a highly potent adjuvant to PregSure BVD, a new vaccine against bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), induced fatal immune reactions with production of alloreactive antibodies in 5\u201310% of vaccinated cows (7\u20139). These alloantibodies were transmitted to calves, regardless of kin, via the colostrum of these dams (8, 10) and caused bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) (7, 11\u201313), even years after the vaccine has been taken off the market (14). BNP calves suffered from hemorrhagic diathesis, thrombo and leukocytopenia and bone marrow depletion, which resulted in a deadly bleeding disorder (10, 15, 16). Several authors hypothesized alloimmune reactions against the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) as causal for BNP (17\u201320). This hypothesis is still controversial since MHC I alloantibodies would be expected to bind all nucleated cells, not only to blood-derived and hematopoietic progenitor cells (12, 16). Also transcriptome analyses provided evidence that MHC I can be excluded as single causal agent for BNP-associated alloantibodies (21). As other authors claimed the possibility of a genetic predisposition of BNP dams for production of BNP inducing alloantibodies (22\u201324), our studies focused on investigating a general difference in immune responses between PregSure BVD vaccinated control cows and BNP donors. We wanted to analyze if there is evidence for differential expression of master transcription factors of cellular immune response in lymphocyte proteome of controls and BNP dams. Interestingly, we found a markedly different immune phenotype in BNP dams, characterized by significant hyperproliferation of lymphocytes and a deviant immune signaling pathway compared to controls. We were next interested to see if we could find evidence for this immune phenotype in cows that were never vaccinated with PregSure BVD. Further testing showed that this altered immune phenotype was also detectable in 22% of cows from a PregSure BVD unvaccinated cohort. This confirmed its natural, not vaccine-induced, appearance in cattle and gave more evidence for immune deviant (ID) phenotype as a genetic predisposition. In further in-depth experiments we found that Interleukin-2 (IL-2) plays an important role in diverging immune response of ID lymphocytes. In addition to these immune response studies, we analyzed the functional correlation of the ID phenotype with overall 10 health parameters and 6 diseases in a retrospective study over 38 months. Here, a significantly increased mastitis incidence in cows with an ID phenotype became apparent, highlighting the clinical impact of altered immune response.",

We hypothesize that the origin of this altered immune response lies in the existence of a naturally occurring deviant immune phenotype. In this study, we could effectively confirm a quantitative difference in immune cell activation of BNP PBL through hyperproliferative responses in vitro (Figures 1A,B). A shift in lymphocyte subpopulations (CD4+, CD8+, B cells) as a potential reason for these differential responses toward polyclonal immune stimulation could be excluded (Figure 2). The hierarchical clustering of identified lymphocyte proteins from our shotgun proteomics experiment substantiated a general quantitative difference in constitutive expression of proteins in PBL of controls and BNP dams (cE, Figures 3A,B). After immune stimulation, these differences increased even further (PWM/ConA, Figures 3A,B). In order to perform more in-depth investigations of potential functional differences, we subsequently focused on the analysis of master transcription factors of immune cell regulation from our dataset. As a result, we detected several differentially expressed STATs. STATs initiate the differentiation of various Th cell subsets (24) as first-response master regulators and provide lineage specificity by promoting the differentiation of a given Th cell subset while opposing the differentiation to alternative Th cell subsets (32). This makes them especially interesting to us, since expression of different STATs in controls and BNP specimen indicates divergent immune response pathways in these groups. In control lymphocytes we identified STAT1 with increased expression (Figure 3D) and significantly higher activation (Figures 4A,B) after T cell stimulation with ConA. In mice and man, STAT1 is important for the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells to Th1 cells (33) or to type 1 regulatory (Tr) T cells (34). From these findings, we conclude that after immune stimulation, bovine control lymphocytes use the STAT1 pathway and we hypothesize that control cows react with a Th1 or Tr immune response in polyclonal stimulation assays. The effect of STAT1 inhibition could not be tested, since we found no STAT1 specific inhibitor that was commercially available. In contrast to controls, PBL proteome of BNP dams showed higher expression levels of STAT3 (Figure 3D), with increased phosphorylation (Figures 4C,D) in BNP lymphocytes after immune stimulation. STAT3 could therefore be a possible master regulator for the deviant immune response in BNP dams. In mouse and man, STAT3 induces the development of follicular Th (Tfh), Th17, and Th22 cells (32, 35, 36). Our findings proved a STAT3 pathway dependent immune response of BNP lymphocytes after polyclonal stimulation, but so far it is unknown which Th subsets exactly are regulated by STAT3 in cows. The dependence of the hyperproliferative phenotype of immune deviant PBL on STAT3 was shown by inhibition of respective factor using WP 1,066, a cell permeable tyrphostin analog which blocks the STAT3 pathway through inhibition of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) protein tyrosine kinase (37). As a result, we observed a significantly reduced proliferation to 37% in BNP PBL, but no effect in control PBL (Figure 5). Our findings therefore show, that the deviant immune response of BNP donors is associated with STAT3/JAK2 pathway. Further studies will be needed to clarify whether immune cells from control cows differentiate to Th1 or Tr subsets and if BNP donor cows develop Tfh, Th17, or Th22 cells after immune stimulation. Hyper-reactivity of BNP PBL and the STAT3 driven differentiation of Tfh cells after immune stimulation are supported by findings of other research groups, describing higher alloantibody levels in BNP cows compared to PregSure BVD vaccinated control dams (22). This group also hypothesized, that differences between BNP and control dams are likely due to genes controlling the quantitative alloantibody response after vaccination (22). To find evidence for a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant BNP phenotype in cows (22, 23), we additionally analyzed the immune phenotypes of 121 non-PregSure BVD vaccinated cows. In our study, 22% of cows (ID cows) showed a BNP-like hyperproliferative response to T cell stimulation in vitro (ID, Figures 6A,B). This percentage fits to the findings of Benedictus et al., who hypothesized a heritability of 19% in dams for the development of BNP in the calf (22). This proves the existence of an immune deviant phenotype among a certain subpopulation of cattle, which is not triggered by vaccination with PregSure BVD but occurs naturally. The immune deviant response described here in these ID cows clearly depends on IL-2 (Figure 6C), which we could prove through hyperproliferative response of BNP and ID lymphocytes to stimulation with BanLec (Figure 6B), a mitogen that activates human T cells (28, 30) via the IL-2 pathway (29). For bovine T cells, the specific impact of IL-2 itself was not described so far. In man and mice, however, IL-2 has pleiotropic autocrine or paracrine functions that regulate proliferation of T cells (38). It also plays a key role in promoting development, homeostasis and function of regulatory T cells though IL-2/STAT5 signals (39) and balances expression of different STATs in Th cells of mice (40). Therefore, the association of IL-2 with the immune deviant response in cows is a very interesting finding which merits further in-depth investigations in future studies. To determine whether the newly detected deviant immune phenotype is of clinical relevance, we analyzed 10 clinical parameters and 6 diseases in 100 cows from the sampled dairy farm and compared incidence between controls (n = 73) and ID animals (n = 27). Interestingly, we found a significantly increased mastitis incidence in ID cows compared to controls (Figure 7B). This highly important correlation points to an altered immune reaction of ID cows to classical mastitis pathogens, facilitating mastitis onset in these animals.",
