The possible reasons for the higher rates of retroviruses found in our study might be due to lack of any preventive and vaccination program against FIV and FeLV and also, the presence of large population of stray cats and outdoor access of household cats with them that increase the risk of transmission of FIV and FeLV between cat population.",

FIV was detected in 87.50% and FeLV in all cats showing stomatitis. Results suggests FCV and FIV together may cause stomatitis and FeLV and/or FCV infections in synergism with FIV, enhance the severity of oral cavity disease. Additionally, a study in western Canada showed oral diseases were significantly associated with FIV positivity.25 In 55.00% of cats with corneal ulcers, FHV-1 was not detected but all of them were positive for FIV and FeLV, expressing the systemic immunosuppressive effect of retroviruses that allow microbial invasion to unusual organs. These results are consistent with other reports. In Australia, the prevalence of FeLV was 3.50% in all cats, 1.40% in healthy cats and 6.90% in sick cats. The prevalence of antibodies to FIV was 10.40% in all cats, 4.90% in healthy cats and 16.70% in sick cats attended the veterinary hospital.26 Also, in North Carolina State, 123 cats were tested for FIV antibodies. More clinically ill cats had titers against FIV than did healthy cats (15.00% vs. 3.60%). Previous or current illnesses in these FIV positive cats included several clinical signs such as chronic respiratory tract disease.27 In another investigation in California, 226 cats were studied for FIV, FCV and FeLV prevalence. FIV-infected cats which were co-infected with either FCV or FCV and FeLV, had the highest prevalence of oral cavity infections and the most severe oral lesions.12",
