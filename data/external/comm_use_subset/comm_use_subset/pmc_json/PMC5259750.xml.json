We choose the pNL4-3-Luc-R\u2212E\u2212 based Ebola pseudovirion to study the Ebola entry, and the Ebola VLP-mcherry (composed by GP, VP40 and VP40-mcherry) to study the Ebola internalization. Then, we treated the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 with two SERMs (tamoxifen and clomiphene), and infected them with the Ebola pseudovirion. Both SERMs selectively inhibited the Ebola entry more than 90%; however, they did not inhibit the entry of the VSV or Influenza A (A/WSN/33(H1N1), WSN) pseudovirions (Fig. 1a). Treatment with estrogen and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists did not inhibit the Ebola pseudovirion entry (Fig. 1a), excluding the possibility that SERMs inhibit the Ebola entry through the ER pathway.",

Considering the critical role of NPC1 domain C in Ebola entry in our previous study and the similar structural properties of the CADs displaying selective anti-Ebola activity34, we speculated that the CADs with selective anti-Ebola activity may target NPC1 to inhibit Ebola entry. To test this possibility, we expressed and purified the domains A and C of NPC13435. Then, we carried out MicroScale Thermophoresis (MST) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) to detect the interactions between tamoxifen, clomiphene, or U18666a and the NPC1 domains A and C. In all cases, we did not detect interactions by MST or ITC (Supplementary Fig. S3a, S3b, respectively).",

The Ebola pseudovirion assay demonstrated that SERMs inhibit Ebola entry starting from 1 \u03bcM (Fig. 2a). Filipin staining also indicated that SERMs induce cholesterol accumulation at approximately 1 \u03bcM (Fig. 2b,d, Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the dosages of SERMs required to induce cholesterol accumulation matches the dosages of SERMs required for Ebola entry inhibition, which implies that this incidental biological activity of SERMs are related to the Ebola entry inhibition mechanism. Intriguingly, the cholesterol accumulation appeared after 8 h of SERMs incubation (Fig. 2c,e), whereas the Ebola virus has already entered the cytoplasm at approximately 2 h36. Thus, we speculated that intercellular changes within 2 h after SERM treatment should mediate the cholesterol accumulation and the inhibition of Ebola entry.",

Ebola virion is thought to be internalized into endolysosome primarily through micropinocytosis394041, meanwhile the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain and glycan cap of GP1 is removed by the low pH-dependent Cathepsins L and B, resulting in a 17- to 19-kDa GP14243. Proteolytic processing of GP expose the GP1 receptor binding domain (RBD), which interact with the NPC1 domain C within the endolysosome4445. This interaction between GP1 and NPC1 domain C and low pH conditions are essential for subsequent membrane fusion153446. However, whether there is other membrane fusion trigger factor remains unclear. Recently, it has been proven that TPC2 plays a key role in Ebola virus infection and the Ebola virus enters cells through the endolysosome that contain both NPC1 and TPC24748. Although the definite role of TPC2 is uncertain, as a calcium channel, it may involve the movement of endosomes containing Ebola virus or the membrane fusion.",

However, we did not detect any interactions of tamoxifen/clomiphene/U18666a with NPC1 domains A or C. In accordance with our results, another group also showed that clomiphene and U18666a do not disturb the interaction of NPC1 domain C and Ebola primed GP3. Recently, a study demonstrated that U18666a interacts with the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain (SSD) to inhibit NPC1 function and cholesterol transport; however, the authors emphasized that the inhibition of Ebola requires 100-fold higher concentrations of U18666A. They therefore excluded the possibility that U18666a interacts with the SSD of NPC1 to inhibit the Ebola entry49. Thus, these data demonstrate that NPC1 is not the target of CADs during Ebola entry inhibition.",

The majority of these CADs having selective anti-Ebola activity have the similar structural properties (pKa > 8, logP > 3) (Supplementary Fig. S6a). Based on their structural properties, most CADs are protonated, trapped, and finally concentrated in the acid endolysosome compartment27. Due to the liposolubility of CADs, they insert into the lipid bilayer of endolysosome and disturb the metabolism of lipids and the transport of several components, leading to the DIP, cholesterol accumulation, and/or functional inhibition of ASM (Supplementary Fig. S6b). Moreover, most CADs induce their incidental biological activities at micromolar concentrations, which match the concentrations of inhibition Ebola infection by CADs. Thus, it is possible that CADs inhibit Ebola entry through their incidental biological activities. A filipin staining and Ebola pseudovirion entry assay demonstrated that SERMs and U18666a induce the cholesterol accumulation and inhibit the Ebola entry at the same concentration (approximately 1 \u03bcM); however, the cholesterol accumulation (8 h) appeared after Ebola entry into the cytoplasm (2 h), implying that something changed within 2 h after the SERMs treatment to mediate the cholesterol accumulation and the inhibition of Ebola entry.",

Moreover, the proteins in endolysosomal calcium channels, TPC1 and TPC2, recently have been identified as key players in Ebola entry. The inhibitors for TPCs can block nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-stimulated calcium outflow and Ebola infection47. The sphingosine treatment could induce the deregulation of endolysosomal calcium53, and a subsequent study demonstrated that TPC1 and TPC2 (mainly TPC1) mediate the endolysosomal calcium response to sphingosine54. Consistent with these results, we proved that SERMs and U18666a decrease the sphingosine and increase the endolysosomal calcium. In addition, chelating luminal endocytic calcium with high-affinity Rhod-dextran also blocks Ebola infection, but not the internalization of Ebola VLP to TPC2+ lysosome.

This study revealed the mechanism of Ebola inhibition by toremifene, however, binding and destabilize GP may not play the major role in other situation. Firstly, the author informed that residues lining the binding site are highly conserved among filoviruses except Marburg virus (MARV), suggesting that MARV may not bind these drugs, but it has been proven that toremifene and clomiphene (even other CADs) could effectively inhibit the infection of MARV46. Secondly, compared to the ethyl chlorine of toremifene, the corresponding ethyl group in tamoxifen and chlorine in clomiphene make weaker interations with the binding sites in Ebola GP16, and the obvious structural differences of raloxifene (and other CADs with anti-Ebola activities) with toremifene make the interactions more weaker (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, all these drugs can effectively inhibit the Ebola infection3467. Thirdly, many of CADs with anti-Ebola activities inhibit Ebola and/or MARV infection at similar kinetics (inhibition > 90% at 10 \u03bcM)3467, which is hard explained by interaction with GP. Therefore, the binding with GP plays a major role in Ebola inhibition by toremifene, but may not in the Ebola or MARV inhibition by toremifene, tamoxifen, clomiphene, raloxifene or U18666a (even other CADs with anti-Ebola activities).",

Based on previous studies and our results, we proposed a hypothesis of the Ebola infection (Fig. 6). Under normal conditions, Ebola is internalized by the NPC1+/TPC2+ endolysosome55, in which the primed GP interacts with NPC1 domain C34. The ASM and AC in the endolysosome then hydrolyze sphingomyelin to sphingosine27. The elevated sphingosine induces endolysosomal calcium outflow through TPC1 and TPC254. Both the local calcium flux and the interaction of primed GP with NPC1 domain C induce conformational changes in the Ebola fusion peptide, triggering the membrane fusion during the Ebola infection34. When treated with CADs that have selective anti-Ebola activities, including SERMs and U18666a, the CADs are protonated and trapped inside the acidic endolysosome27. Due to their structural properties, these concentrated CADs induce the detachment of the ASM protein from membranes, which inactivates the ASM and in turn leads to a decrease in sphingosine27. Without sufficient sphingosine, the endolysosomal calcium outflow mediated by TPC1 and TPC2 are blocked, leading the endolysosomal calcium accumulation. Without the calcium flux, there is no conformational change of the Ebola fusion peptide. Thus, there is neither membrane fusion nor Ebola infection.",

The ASM and AC in the endolysosome then hydrolyze sphingomyelin to sphingosine. The elevated sphingosine induces endolysosomal calcium outflow through TPC1 and TPC2. Both the local calcium flux and the interaction of primed GP with NPC1 domain C induce conformational changes in the Ebola fusion peptide, triggering the membrane fusion during the Ebola infection. When treated with CADs that have selective anti-Ebola activities, including SERMs and U18666a, the CADs are protonated and trapped inside the acidic endolysosome. Due to their structural properties, these concentrated CADs induce the detachment of the ASM protein from membranes, which inactivates the ASM and in turn leads to a decrease in sphingosine. Without sufficient sphingosine, the endolysosome calcium outflow mediated by TPC1 and TPC2 are blocked, leading the endolysosome calcium accumulation. Without the calcium flux, there is no conformational change of the Ebola fusion peptide. Thus, there is neither membrane fusion nor Ebola infection.",
