The plates were then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.2. Cat sera were then incubated with rabbit anti cat IgG antigen conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution; OriGene Technologies, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA) whereas dog sera were incubated with Protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution; Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. Excess conjugate was removed by extensive washing in PBS-Tween and the plates were developed by addition of the substrate 2,29-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) (Sigma-Aldrich-Merck, Jerusalem, Israel). Each plate was read when the absorbance (lambda = 405 nm) of the positive reference serum reached an optical density (OD) value between 1.1\u20131.2 for cat samples and 1.2\u20131.4 for dog samples. A titration of positive and negative reference cat or dog sera were included on each plate to monitor inter-assay variation. A serological cut-off of 0.4 OD for cats and for dogs was calculated based on four standard deviations above the mean OD values of readings from eight control sera of PCR-negative cats and dogs, respectively, from non-endemic areas for leishmaniosis. Borderline positive levels were considered antibody levels that were in the range between the three and four standard deviations which were 0.2\u20130.4 OD for dogs and 0.3\u20130.4 for cats.",

The catch was chilled and kept at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until sorting. All sand fly males were identified to the species level by the morphology of the genitalia using the keys of Abonnec & Lewis [8, 9]. The females were not identified to the species level and pooled in groups of 20 specimens for molecular detection of Leishmania DNA. All samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until testing.

This is opposite from the situation in the Aeolian islands study where 25.7% of the cats and 34.6% of the dogs surveyed were positive by the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT) [11]. The ratio between cat and dog seroreactivity was even lower in the Lisbon metropolitan area study where only one cat of 76 was seropositive by IFAT whereas 20.4% of the dogs were seropositive, and the authors of the study suggested that the serological test which they used may not have been sufficiently sensitive for detection of anti-leishmanial antibodies in cats [10]. The reason for the high seroprevalence rate in the shelter cats from Israel may have been due to the extensive close contact of these cats with infected dogs harboring a high parasite load in the presence of abundant sand fly vectors in a small compound. It may have also been related to their close association with many other infected cats under these conditions.",

Israel is endemic for three species of Leishmania, L. tropica and L. major, which cause cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans, and L. infantum which causes visceral leishmaniasis [22]. Although L. major and L. tropica have been shown to cause disease in rare cases of dogs in Israel [23\u201325], and both of these species have been reported to infect cats apparently asymptomatically in Turkey [26, 27], infection in the animal shelter was shown to be caused by L. infantum by DNA sequencing of the PCR products.",

This species is considered a proven vector of L. infantum in Algeria and Italy and putative vector in other regions around the Mediterranean Sea including Israel [28]. Its presence in relative high abundance in all the traps placed around the shelter indicates a high likelihood of local transmission of L. infantum. While the second most abundant sand fly species found in the shelter area, P. papatasi is a vector of L. major in Israel, but not of L. infantum [22], the third species P. tobbi found only in small numbers is a vector of L. infantum [29]. The lack of positive detection of L. infantum in the females is reasonable in a collection conducted eight weeks after the removal of the infected animals from the area, and low infection rates of L. infantum in sand flies in general [30, 31].",
