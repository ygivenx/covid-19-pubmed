            "text": "The data compiling process is illustrated in Figure 1A. We retrieved a total of 1,447 HIV-1 interacting human proteins from the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database [18] (the November 13, 2007 freeze). The human-chimpanzee-macaque-mouse orthologous proteins were downloaded from the Ensembl genome browser (release 47), which were identified by the Ensembl project using the Markov clustering algorithm [19]. Note that not all the retrieved human proteins have orthologues in all of the three compared species. In the cases of one-to-many/many-to-many orthologous relationships, only the protein pairs with the reciprocally highest similarity were selected. All of the protein and nucleotide sequences were downloaded from Ensembl. Also note that, among the 1,447 retrieved human proteins, 77 proteins had no Ensembl-identified orthologues in any of the compared species. The remaining 1,370 orthologous protein groups were subsequently aligned using the MUSCLE multiple sequence alignment package [20]. Based on the protein alignments, the corresponding transcripts were aligned and separated into 3 types of genomic regions: 3'UTRs, 5'UTRs and coding sequences (CDSs). Since CAPIH aims to identify species-specific genetic changes (Figure 1B), only orthologous genes from at least three species were considered. In this interface, species-specific indels were identified by using the INDELSCAN Web server [21,22]. Meanwhile, CAPIH shows 7 types of species-specific PTM sites, which were identified by 7 well-known PTM prediction packages with default parameters (including MEMO [23], SUMOsp [24], NetOGlyc [25], NetNGlyc, SulfoSite [26], and NetAcet [27]; Table 1). Considering the relatively low quality of chimpanzee and macaque genomic sequences, we used the Phred quality score of 25 as a cutoff to filter out potential false positive predictions. The quality scores of chimpanzee and macaque genomic sequences were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser [28]. In the case of indels, the quality scores of the 15 nucleotides on either side of the indel were averaged. Whereas in the case of PTMs, 15 nucleotides on either side (i.e. 5 amino acid residues) plus the three nucleotides of the PTM-affected amino acid were taken into account. The potential protein interaction hot sites were identified using 3D-partner [29].",

The classification of interaction key phrases can be found online at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih/keyphrases.php?search_target=keyphrases. Note that these key phrases are retrieved from different publications. Consequently, a \"biological interaction\" may be represented by more than one key phrases. For instance, protein A may \"bind\" and \"inhibit\" protein B.

            "text": "The numbers of species-specific genetic changes identified by CAPIH are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Collectively, the interface has identified more than 86,000, 21,000, and 33,000 species-specific amino acid substitutions, indels, and PTM events, respectively, in the four species. For lineage-specific PTM events, in general, phosphorylation account for the largest proportion of all PTM events, followed by glycosylation (O- and N-linked types together), methylation, sulfation, sumoylation, and lastly by acetylation (Table 3). We find that rhesus macaque has a much larger number of species-specific PTM events than hominoids, whereas human and chimpanzee have approximately equal numbers. Since the annotations of chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genes have remained incomplete, we are conservative about the estimates of the numbers of species-specific PTMs. For accuracy, we further exclude the PTM events that occur in indels (including both lineage- and non-lineage-specific indels), all the numbers of lineage-specific PTMs are thus decreased dramatically (Table 3). Nevertheless, each of the hominoids still has more than 950 species-specific PTM events, and rhesus macaque has ~4,600. This observation is consistent with the primate phylogeny. Considering that chimpanzee is highly resistant to developing AIDS while the other two are not, it is of great interest to investigate whether these PTM events play important roles in AIDS development after HIV-1 infections.",

            "text": "The CAPIH interface provides five query schemes: by gene accession number, gene description, gene ontology, protein domain, and expressing tissue (Figure 2A). Alternatively, the user can also look up the proteins of interest in the protein table, which includes all the proteins analyzed in the interface. All the proteins that match the query key word will be shown with a plus \"+\" sign in front (Figure 2B). Detailed information of each protein can be shown by clicking on the \"+\" sign (Figures. 3 and 4). Note that the information page of each protein is composed of three sections (\"Genome Comparison Statistics\", \"Multiple Sequence Alignments\", and \"Protein Interactions\"). By default only the first section will be deployed when the page is shown. The user can deploy the other two sections by clicking the \"+\" sign before each section. The user can further refine the search by submitting a second key word, or return to the homepage and start a new search. For each protein of interest, CAPIH shows the statistical pie diagram of species-specific variations in the \"Genome Comparison Statistics\" section (substitutions in light blue, indels in purple, and PTMs in green color; Figure 3A). For substitutions and indels, the diagram gives species-specific variations in amino acid sequences, InterPro-predicted protein domains, CDSs, 3'UTR, and 5' UTR (in the top-down direction). Each filled block represents 10 variations. That is, 10 nucleotide substitutions (for CDS and UTRs), amino acid changes (for amino acid and IPR domains), indels, or PTMs. For example, 12 species-specific changes will be shown as 2 filled blocks in the graph. However, if the number of species-specific changes exceeds 40, only 4 filled blocks will be shown (Figure 3A). Note that nucleotide substitutions in coding regions do not necessarily cause amino acid substitutions, whereas indels do. Also note that one indel event may affect more than one amino acids. Therefore, the total numbers of indels and nucleotide substitutions in CDS do not necessarily equal the number of amino acid changes.",

The BIND and HPRD interactions are shown in dashed lines, whereas the HIV-1-human protein interactions in solid lines with colored triangles representing different interaction types. HIV-1 proteins, human proteins, and the protein of interest are shown in blue, green, and white circles, respectively. In this interaction graph, user adjustment is allowed. Any one of the circles can be selected by a mouse click. The selected protein then turns red and can be dragged along with the cursor. Clicking on the blank region will release it. The graph can also be dragged along by clicking and holding the left mouse click, or be zoomed in/out by using the right click in the same way. CAPIH also provides protein IDs and detailed descriptions of interactions when the users click on the corresponding part of the graph. The protein IDs and reference PubMed IDs are hyperlinked to the corresponding databases for more detailed information. An online help file can be found at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih/help.php?search_target=help. The identified species-genetic changes are downloadable at http://bioinfo-dbb.nhri.org.tw/capih/download_table.php?search_target=download.",

It is therefore of interest to investigate the differences in glycosylation between human and the other model organisms. From CAPIH, we have identified 322 and 282 human- and chimpanzee-only glycosylation events, respectively (Table 3). Many of these proteins are T cell surface antigens. For example, CAPIH shows two experimentally verified N-glycosylation sites in the CD3G molecule (NP_000064) at positions 52 and 92. However, at position 52 the glycosylation site (Asn) was substituted by Thr in mouse, whereas the one at position 92 becomes Asp and Glu in rhesus macaque and mouse, respectively. Therefore, human has one and two more N-glycosylation sites, separately, when compared with rhesus macaque and mouse. These glycosylation sites are interesting targets for experimental verification and subsequent functional analyses. If the glycosylation events are proven important for changes in immune responses, researchers can further examine CD3G-related PPIs to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms.",

CAPIH indicates that none of these proteins has an orthologue in the mouse genome. Since the APOBEC3 proteins are known to be involved in host defense against retroviruses, these proteins have undergone substantial changes because of positive selection [33,34]. This is a good example of remarkably different host factors even between very closely related species such as human and chimpanzee. Indeed, CAPIH identifies a considerable number of genetic changes in the cytidine deaminase domains of the human-chimpanzee APOBEC3 orthologues (Table 4).",

As shown in Table 4, APOBEC3B and 3C have obviously diverged more than 3A and 3F both in terms of the number of amino acid substitutions and the number of potential PTM changes. It is therefore speculated that APOBEC 3B/3C may have played an important role in the divergence of hominoid immune responses against retroviruses. Nevertheless, the changes in 3A and 3F, though not as drastic, can also have functional effects. Functional studies are required to unravel the biological implications of these changes. Also noteworthy is that no indels are found in the cytidine deaminase domain in all of the four proteins, suggesting strong negative selection on indels in spite of the increased substitution rate in this domain.",

The C-terminal half of VPRBP has a proline-rich domain and a number of Phe-x-x-Phe repeats, which serves as the Vpr binding domain [39]. Consequently, it is speculated that the loss of the C-terminal amino acids in mouse VPRBP may have certain effects on the Vpr-VPRBP binding affinity.

Comparative studies of host-virus interactions provide a path to understand the possible mechanisms of how viruses break species boundary into humans, and why they cause pathological conditions in humans but rarely do so in other animals. Differences in PPIs may harbor part of the answers. Since PTMs are critical to PPIs, they should be taken into consideration when analyzing the effects of different PPIs on host pathology. Meanwhile, PTM by itself is actually critical to host-virus interactions. Glycosylation, for example, is widely known to be critical to viral recognition and entrance into target cells. Given the wide spectrum of biological functions in which PTMs are involved, variations in host protein PTM patterns should have major impacts on immune response and virus life cycle.",

In comparison, in the 1,370 proteins compared, human and chimpanzee each has more than 600 species-specific substitution-related phosphorylation sites (Table 3). In other words, on average, each HIV-interacting protein in both human and chimpanzee has an average of 0.4 species-specific phosphorlation sites. This example illustrates the importance of \"PTMome\". Glycome, the collective sum of all glycans and part of the PTMome (if glycolipids are not considered), is known to be remarkably larger than proteome [43,44]. Therefore, it is easily understandable that PTMome is actually much larger than proteome. The large numbers of species-specific PTMs in HIV-interacting proteins illustrate the great potential of PTM studies in virology and AIDS studies.",

Specifically, comparative analyses of host-HIV interactions may shed some light on the mechanisms of differences in AIDS progression between human and chimpanzee. A number of possible mechanisms have been proposed [8,45]. However, none of them provides a systematic view in the context of host-HIV protein interactions. Furthermore, PTMs, perhaps one of the most important regulatory mechanisms of host-pathogen protein interactions, have been rarely studied in a comparative way.
