They exist as seven species (A-G) with greater than 50 types identified so far that can affect different organs and cause a wide spectrum of disease in both immunocompetent [1\u20134] and immunocompromised [1, 5\u20138] individuals, including pneumonitis, hepatitis, gastroenteritis and conjunctivitis [1]. Although adenoviruses are important respiratory pathogens in haematology patients, adenovirus surveillance in blood is not normally performed in non-transplant adult patients. We report here a case of adenovirus pneumonitis which led to a fatal disseminated adenovirus infection in an adult patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) on chemotherapy.",

From a virological viewpoint, since all systemic antiviral drugs are only virostatic and not virucidal, earlier adenovirus PCR blood testing allowing earlier treatment to prevent further increases in viral load, may improve clinical outcomes [1].
