Viruses in this family can cause a wide range of diseases, including intestinal, respiratory, neurological, cardiac, hepatic, mucocutaneous and systemic diseases of various severities in both humans and animals (Racaniello, 2013). Since porcine enterovirus 8 (PEV-8), simian type 2 picornavirus and duck picornavirus TW90A have a unique genomic organization different from other picornavirus genera (Son et al., 2014a), the genus Sapelovirus is a newly assigned member of the Picornaviridae family (Adams et al., 2015). The Sapelovirus genus consists of three species: Sapelovirus A (SV-A) formerly known as porcine sapelovirus, Sapelovirus B formerly named as simian sapelovirus and Avian sapelovirus formerly known as duck picornavirus TW90A (Adams et al., 2015).",

The genomes of SV-As and other members in the genus Sapelovirus have the typical picornavirus genome organization: 5'-UTR-L-VP4-VP2-VP3-VP1-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B-3C-3D-3'-UTR (Krumbholz et al., 2002; Oberste et al., 2002, 2003; Son et al., 2014a; Tseng & Tsai, 2007). However, there are significant structural differences in the SV-A genome, e.g. the cis-acting RNA element (CRE) in the 2c coding region and kissing domain in the 3'-UTR vary between recent Korean and Chinese strains and older English and Chinese strains (Son et al., 2014a). These differences in antigenic diversity and structural features can influence the pathogenicity and/or host range restriction of SV-A strains, yet we have a limited understanding of the pathogenesis of SV-A (Son et al., 2014a).",

Large intestinal lesions, including crypt fusion with epithelial cell hyperplasia, were observed at 2 dpi, increased until 5 dpi followed by a decrease at 7 dpi (Fig. 2). Lungs from infected piglets showed lymphoid cell infiltration in the peribronchiolar submucosa and perivascular space from 5 dpi to the end of the experiment (Fig. 3). As shown in Table 2, adaptive immune reactions to SV-A infection evident as perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes and gliosis were observed in both grey and white matters of spinal cord (myelitis) and brain (encephalitis) (Fig. 3). These typical host defence reactions were observed from 7 dpi until the termination of the experiment. Neuronophagia and chromatolysis were not frequently found in the spinal cord or the brain. However, spinal cords showed stronger inflammatory reactions than the brain (Table 2). No specific lesion was observed in other organs or tissues collected from piglets regardless of SV-A infection. However, SV-A did not induce any histopathological change in any organ or tissue sequentially sampled from SV-A-inoculated chicks during the entire experimental period (Fig. 4).

            "text": "All viruses initiate infection by binding to specific receptor(s) on the surface of susceptible host cells (Neu et al., 2011). We have previously demonstrated that SV-A could utilize \u03b12,3-linked SA on GD1a glycolipid as a receptor (Kim et al., 2016). Indeed, glycolipid-associated \u03b12,3-terminal SA is abundant on the cell surface of both avian and porcine species (de Graaf & Fouchier, 2014; Raman et al., 2014). However, our results in this study revealed that SV-A infection was limited to cells of porcine origin. It could not infect cells of other origins including chickens and humans. Moreover, SV-A was replicated in piglets but not in chicks, confirming that SV-A could not cause interspecies transmission at least between pigs and chickens. Our results also suggested that other factors in addition to glycolipid-associated \u03b12,3-terminal SA might be required for efficient SV-A replication in cells of non-porcine origin. We have previously observed that chymotrypsin or trypsin treatment of cells has no effect on virus infection (Kim et al., 2016), suggesting that cell surface-associated proteins do not play accessory roles in SV-A infection. The nature of post-binding block to infection in cells from non-porcine origin is as yet unknown, but it is possible the SV-A infection of avian cells induces the innate response leading to the restriction of viral replication.",

            "text": "Although previous studies have indicated that SV-A can cause enteritis, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders (Alexandersen et al., 2012; Huang et al., 1980; Lamont & Betts, 1960; Lan et al., 2011; Schock et al., 2014; Sibalin, 1963), the pathogenicity and/or host range restriction of SV-A have been poorly characterized. In the current study, the most significant lesions were found in the intestines during the early infection period, where severe villous atrophy was found to be associated with high viral RNA loads in the faecal samples and strong SV-A antigen reactivity in the intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, the spinal cord and brain mainly showed signs of adaptive immune response (non-suppurative inflammation) and comparatively low viral RNA copy numbers without clear evidence of SV-A antigen-positive cells. These data indicated that the Korean SV-A strain (KS04105) used in this study was enteropathogenic. Contrary to our data, a recent study has reported that neuroinvasive English SV-A strain replication in the spinal cord could lead to severe adaptive immune responses (non-suppurative polioencephalomyelitis) without causing lesions in other tissues (Schock et al., 2014). This English SV-A strain (G5) is phylogenetically closer to the English V13 strain than to other SV-A strains circulating recently in Korea and China (Schock et al., 2014; Son et al., 2014a). The molecular basis involved in the differences in virulence and tropism among SV-A strains remains unknown. However, there is clear evidence showing that variation in RNA structures can contribute to viral virulence (Son et al., 2014a). An additional explanation for discordance in tropism may be variation in the age of animals used in studies. The English SV-A study used adult pigs (Schock et al., 2014), whereas this study used neonatal piglets. Further studies are required to examine the predilections of age and inoculation routes, as well as antigenic and genomic differences, so that our understanding of variations in SV-A pathogenesis and/or host range restriction can be improved.",

The virus solution was then diluted in distilled water and further purified by ultracentrifugation. Purified viruses were dialysed in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) for fluorescence labelling or in TNE buffer for radioactivity assay overnight. Purified viruses were then stored in aliquots at \u201380 \u00b0C.",

Briefly, all tissues and fluid samples collected from experimental animals were individually weighed, homogenized or vortexed at a 1 : 10 dilution in 0.01 M PBS and centrifuged (tissues 13 000 g for 3 min; faecal samples 5000 g for 10 min). The supernatants, along with the remaining bulk samples, were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for analysis. To quantitate SV-A genome copy numbers, cells were infected without or with SV-A strain KS04105 at an m.o.i. of 1 p.f.u. cell\u22121 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4, 8, 15 and 72 h post infection as described above. Each infected cell culture was freeze-thawed three times, and cell debris was spun down at 2469 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. After extracting total RNA from supernatants, each real-time RT-PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene real-time amplification system (Corbett Research) and SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX One-Step mix (Enzynomics) in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l containing 10 \u00b5l of SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX One-Step mix (Enzynomics), 0.2 \u00b5l of reverse transcriptase, 0.4 \u00b5l of RiboSafe RNase Inhibitor, 0.8 \u00b5l of PSV1 primer (GGCAGTAGCGTGGCGAGC at positions between 153 and 170 of the 5\u2032-UTR), 0.8 \u00b5l of PSV2 primer (CTACTCTCCTGTAACCAGT at positions between 242 and 260 of the 5\u2032-UTR), 4 \u00b5l of template and 3.8 \u00b5l RNase-free dH2O. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 \u00b0C for 15 min followed by the activation of Hot Start DNA polymerase at 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 14 s and 72 \u00b0C for 10 s. Quantitation of virus RNA copies was carried out using a standard curve derived from 10-fold serial dilutions of in vitro transcripted cRNA amplified in separate PCR tubes. Rotorgene 6000\u00ae (Corbett Research) software was used to calculate the amount of SV-A-specific RNA in the samples. The threshold was defined automatically in the initial exponential phase, reflecting the highest amplification rate. With regard to the crossing points resulting from the amplification curves and threshold, a direct relation between cycle number and log concentration of RNA molecules initially present in the RT-PCR was evident. By linear regression analysis of these data, Rotorgene 6000\u00ae software was used to set up a standard curve to determine the concentration of RNA present in the samples.",
