            "text": "Pathogens and concurrent tissue damage elicit complex context-dependent inflammatory response programs (Hotamisligil, 2017). Chronic infections represent a particular challenge for the host organism, which is exposed to prolonged inflammation that may predispose to various co-morbidities, such as susceptibility to secondary infections and cancer (Okin and Medzhitov, 2012, Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005, Virgin et al., 2009). The same inflammatory pathways can also control cellular tissue homeostasis and metabolism (Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015, Medzhitov, 2008, O\u2019Neill and Pearce, 2016). Different cell types and organs communicate with each other through soluble cytokines, thereby determining the quality, magnitude, and duration of both local and systemic immune responses (Medzhitov, 2008). The liver is a central metabolic organ but also represents an immunoregulatory hub between blood-borne pathogens and the immune system (Jenne and Kubes, 2013, Protzer et al., 2012, Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006). Hepatocytes are the functional unit of the liver parenchyma and the most abundant cell type of the liver. As such, their principal task is the turnover of metabolites during homeostasis. Yet they are also important immune signaling platforms that produce and react to a range of cytokines upon inflammation (Crispe, 2016, Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006, Zhou et al., 2016). Hepatocytes themselves are permissible to a variety of chronic viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice (Guidotti et al., 1999, Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005). The chronic infection model of LCMV represents a well-established and pathophysiologically relevant experimental model for the study of host-pathogen interactions and immune responses that induce a vigorous CD8 T-cell-dependent hepatitis (Zehn and Wherry, 2015, Zinkernagel et al., 1986). The involved immunopathologic mechanisms seen in the LCMV model are similar to those observed in patients chronically infected with HBV or HCV (Guidotti et al., 1999, Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005).",

            "text": "Soluble inflammatory signals act mainly through cytokine receptors (Hotamisligil, 2017, Protzer et al., 2012, Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006). Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are central antiviral cytokines that signal through the ubiquitously expressed IFNAR receptor, which is composed of the two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. This induces the expression of a broad array of genes described as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs exert antiviral functions by direct interference with viral replication and immunoregulatory properties (McNab et al., 2015, Schoggins et al., 2011). More recently, IFN-Is are also recognized as modulators of metabolism, such as cellular lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis (Bhattacharya et al., 2015, Pantel et al., 2014, Wu et al., 2016, York et al., 2015). Cytokine-induced regulation of liver metabolism is expected to result in altered metabolite turnover and release that impacts distal organs (van den Berghe, 1991, Norata et al., 2015). Immune cells and in particular T cells critically depend on certain metabolites to efficiently perform their functions and are thus susceptible to altered metabolite availability (Chang et al., 2015, Geiger et al., 2016, Johnson et al., 2018, Pearce et al., 2009). In line with this, a frequent immune evasion mechanism of cancer is the depletion of essential amino acids or glucose in the tumor microenvironment (Buck et al., 2017, Chang et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2017, Murray, 2016).",

This confirmed the peak of viral propagation around day 8 after infection with a subsequent decline of viral loads. Liver damage was assessed by the clinical hallmark parameters alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that peaked on day 8\u201312 after infection (Figure 1B). In an unbiased approach to virus-induced changes in the liver, we collected liver tissue from infected mice at different phases of infection (day 2 \u2248 innate phase; day 8 \u2248 peak of disease; day 30 \u2248 chronic phase; day 60 \u2248 resolving phase) and performed transcriptome analyses by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptomic data showed high intra-replica reproducibility and individual samples clustered according to the time course of infection (Figure 1C), highlighting phase-specific changes in gene expression and the gradual recovery of mice by 60 days after infection. In total, 3,626 transcripts were differentially regulated (Table S1A) and the most differentially expressed genes were found on days 2 and 8 after infection (Figure S1A). Hierarchical clustering identified three broad categories of gene expression programs, including transcripts that were found already regulated on day 2 (clusters 1\u20134) or induced on day 8 (clusters 5\u201310) as well as transcripts that were repressed during infection (clusters 11\u201315; Figure 1D; Table S2A). To corroborate transcriptional alterations, we performed tissue proteomics and quantified 5,586 proteins in the liver (Table S1B). Protein changes correlated with differentially expressed transcripts (Figures 1E and S1B; Table S2C). Of the identified clusters, differentially expressed genes associated with antiviral IFN-I signaling were found to be enriched on day 2 (clusters 1\u20134; Figure 1F; Table S2B) although leukocyte-associated genes were mainly found on day 8 after infection (clusters 5\u201310; Figure 1F; Table S2B). Some of these differential expression changes are likely to reflect hepatic immune cell infiltration (Figure S1C).",

This is in line with our recent study about the modulation of circulating lipids during acute LCMV infection (Kosack et al., 2017). For an in-depth integration of these metabolic changes, we performed enrichment analyses of the union of differentially regulated transcripts and proteins at each stage of viral infection on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways. We identified global reprogramming of processes related to all the major classes of metabolites. Modulation of hepatic pathways involving lipids and essential amino acids was initiated on day 2 and peaking on day 8 after infection (Figure 1G; Table S1C). Differentially expressed metabolic processes were also found in the chronic and resolving phases of infection, although the number of modulated transcripts and proteins were lower (Figures 1G, S1A, and S1B).",

Downregulation of metabolites on day 2 (Figure S1E) was observed for glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (Figure 1H; clusters 1 and 3) although acylcarnitines (Figure 1H; cluster 4) were rather upregulated on day 8 after infection (Figure 1H). Systemic amino acids and biogenic amines exhibited a sustained decline from day 2 to day 8 and gradually recovered in the later phases of infection (Figure 1H; cluster 2). This affected almost exclusively essential and semi-essential proteinogenic amino acids (His, Ile, Leu, Met, Trp, Val, and Arg; Figure 1H) and coincided with transcriptional regulation of amino-acid-related metabolic pathways on day 8 (Figures 1F\u20131H and S1F; Table S1C).

We therefore performed a pair-feeding experiment to investigate the impact of infection-associated changes in food uptake to the metabolic reprogramming of the liver 8 days after infection. Uninfected mice received restricted amounts of food equivalent to the amounts consumed by infected mice. Subsequently, we collected liver tissue of infected, pair-fed, and naive animals and performed transcriptome analyses. These results indicated that most of the observed transcriptional changes were linked to viral infection and independent of anorexic behavior (Figures 2A, S2B, and S2C). Uninfected pair-fed mice showed only minor differential gene expression changes that pertained mainly to lipid metabolism (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S4). Together, these experiments demonstrated that the majority of the observed virus-induced metabolic changes in the liver, including amino-acid-related pathways, correlated with the infection status of the mice and were independent of altered food intake (Figures 1H and 2D).",

            "text": "The observed changes of hepatic amino acid metabolism became noticeable as early as 2 days, which coincides with peak serum levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in mice infected with LCMV (Bhattacharya et al., 2015). Thus, we aimed to dissect a potential role of early IFN-I signaling in the observed changes in the liver. To measure the impact of IFN-I signaling on liver parenchyma, we performed an extracellular metabolic flux analysis of primary murine hepatocytes upon stimulation with IFN-\u03b2 in vitro. IFN-\u03b2 affected proxies for mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in an IFNAR1-dependent manner (Figures 3A and 3B), indicating that IFN-I signaling affects metabolism of hepatocytes. To deconvolute tissue heterogeneity in vivo and to assess the contribution of IFN-I signaling to metabolic reprogramming in the liver, we took advantage of a genetic model of hepatocyte-specific ablation of Ifnar1 (Alb-Cre ERT2 Ifnar1fl/fl [Ifnar1\u0394/\u0394]) and respective littermate controls (Alb-Cre ERT2 Ifnar1+/+ [Ifnar1+/+]). These mice did not reveal any genotype-specific differences in viremia or serum concentration of IFN-\u03b1 1.5 days after infection (Figures S3A\u2013S3C), suggesting that any potential differences seen in expression profiling of liver tissue from Ifnar1\u0394/\u0394 versus Ifnar1+/+ mice is unlikely to be due to altered viral loads and/or systemic IFN-I responses. Moreover, naive and infected Ifnar1\u0394/\u0394 versus Ifnar1+/+ animals displayed comparable abundances of immune-cell-related transcripts, suggesting only minor differences of immune cell infiltration between the genotypes at this early time point after infection (Figure S3D). Next, we analyzed transcriptomic changes of liver tissue taken from uninfected and infected mice of either genotype at the peak of serum IFN-\u03b1 levels and employed a limma (2 \u00d7 2 factorial) interaction model. This resulted in a set of 526 hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1-regulated genes, which were found to be associated with both classical ISG responses as well as metabolic processes (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3E; Table S5A). The regulated genes could be divided into two major classes\u2014IFNAR1-stimulated (cluster 1) and IFNAR1-repressed (cluster 2) genes (Figure 3C; Table S5B). The majority of induced genes were well-known classical ISGs encoding for antiviral effectors (cluster 1; Figure 3D; Table S5C; Schoggins et al., 2011). Interferon-repressed genes (IRGs), which are not that well characterized (Mostafavi et al., 2016, Schoggins et al., 2011), were found to be strongly enriched for metabolism-associated processes (cluster 2; Figure 3D; Table S5C). In addition, clusters 3 and 4 contained genes whose maintained expression depended on intact IFNAR1 signaling and were also associated with metabolic processes (Figure 3D; Table S5C). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling mainly regulated metabolic genes on day 2 after infection. Notably, a bioinformatic intersection with our longitudinal data obtained from chronically infected wild-type mice suggested that the IFN-I-dependent regulation of many of these genes is maintained beyond these early time points (Figure 3E). Specifically, virus-induced gene regulation of amino-acid-related pathways (Figure 1) was driven by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling (Figure 3E) and corresponded with the differentially regulated metabolites observed in infected wild-type mice (Figure 1H). To investigate whether these metabolic changes depended on hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling, we performed metabolomics and found that systemic serum levels were indeed regulated by local IFNAR1 signaling of hepatocytes (Figure S3F). In a more stringent analysis using the limma (2 \u00d7 2 factorial) interaction model, we found 15 serum metabolites to be regulated by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling, including the semi-essential amino acid arginine and its downstream metabolite ornithine (Figure 3F). In summary, our data indicate that hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling acts as a transcriptional regulator of liver metabolism and results in changes of circulating metabolites during infection.",

Both samples showed comparable numbers of reads (uninfected: 1,493.5; infected: 1,429.0) and genes (uninfected: 705.5; infected: 761.0) per cell. We identified 348 differentially expressed genes in hepatocytes that correlated well with changes observed in bulk liver tissue (Figures 1, S4H, and S4I). Accordingly, genes induced in hepatocytes were associated with antiviral innate immune responses, whereas repressed genes were vastly associated with metabolic processes (Figures S4J and S4K). Hepatocytes clustered by the infection status of the mice (Figure 4B), and we confirmed hepatocyte-intrinsic repression of Ass1 and Otc upon infection, which inversely correlated with expression levels of the ISG Ifit1 on the single-cell level (Figures 4C and 4D). Transcriptional repression of Otc and Ass1 manifested in reduced abundance of OTC and ASS1 proteins in hepatocytes as observed by immunohistochemistry on days 2 and 8 after infection (Figures 4E and 4F). As expected, STAT1, a master regulator of IFNAR1 downstream signaling, was significantly upregulated in hepatocytes (Figures 4E and 4F). The modulation of Otc and Ass1 on day 2 and day 8 after infection was confirmed by real-time PCR in sorted hepatocytes (Figure 4G).",

Addition of the ASS1-specific inhibitor \u03b1-methyl-DL-aspartic acid (MDLA) abolished production of argininosuccinate and indicated specificity of the assay (Figure S4L). In line with the IFNAR1-dependent increase of systemic ornithine levels upon infection (Figure 4A), these data indicate that IFNAR1 represses the degradation of ornithine via OTC in hepatocytes. The downregulation of Asl expression, together with decreased argininosuccinate, is expected to aggravate the infection-induced break in the urea cycle by limiting arginine re-synthesis (Figure 4A).",

To test whether similar responses in the liver are seen in an inflammatory context, we administered the synthetic viral RNA analog and TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) intraperitoneally to wild-type mice. Poly(I:C) treatment resulted in strong induction of Ifit1 and corroborated the upregulation of Arg1 and downregulation of Otc and Ass1 in liver tissue by real-time PCR (Figure S4N).

Indeed, blood ammonia levels were significantly increased from 2 up to 8 days after LCMV infection, correlating with downregulation of the ammonia-fixating enzyme Cps1 (Figures 5A and S5A). This prompted us to further characterize the observed urea-cycle-related metabolic changes on a systemic level by in vivo tracing of 13C6 heavy-isotope-labeled arginine (Figure 5B). Liver tissue of infected mice that received a bolus of 13C6 arginine showed increased concentration of labeled ornithine and citrulline (Figure 5C). Arginine was not detected in the liver as reported previously (Wu et al., 2009). These local metabolic changes in the liver tissue, together with transcriptomic and proteomic changes in hepatocytes highly correlated with changes in systemic metabolism. We detected increased 13C6 arginine degradation in the serum (Figure 5D), which is consistent with the induction of Arg1 (Figures 4A and S4C). Together with IFNAR1-dependent repression of Otc and Ass1 (Figures 4A\u20134D), this resulted in the systemic accumulation of 13C5 ornithine and 13C5 citrulline, respectively (Figure 5D). In accordance with increased arginine degradation and decreased ornithine degradation, we detected elevated levels of 13C1-labeled urea in liver tissue (Figure S5B), whereas 13C1-labeled urea was only mildly elevated in the circulation (Figure S5C). Together with the reduction of 13C5 arginine, the end product of this pathway, these results support the notion that viral infection initiates a break of the hepatic urea cycle as early as 2 days after infection that persists at least until 8 days after infection and alters levels of metabolites in the circulation (Figure S5D).",

As expected, recArg1 converted arginine to ornithine in the serum and closely recapitulated the decreased arginine-to-ornithine ratio seen upon viral infection (Figures 5E and S6A). Administration of recArg1 did not affect the abundance of splenic T cells of infected and uninfected animals on day 8 after infection (Figure S6B). Yet, we recognized an impaired shift from naive (CD62L+CD44\u2212) to effector (CD62L\u2212CD44+) T cells (Figures S6C and S6D). Further, the numbers of virus-specific CD8 T cells (Figure 6B) and their ability to produce the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 upon peptide re-stimulation (Figures 6C\u20136E) were diminished upon recArg1 treatment. Virus-specific CD4 T cells were similarly affected (Figure S6E). CD8 T cell effector function remained impaired in recArg1-treated animals at least up to 50 days after infection (Figure 6F) and coincided with elevated viral loads in blood (Figure 6G) and organs 8 and 50 days after infection (Figures S6F\u2013S6I). To investigate whether impaired cytokine production of CD8 T cells upon recArg1 treatment coincides with exhaustion, we analyzed PD1 expression on virus-specific CD8 T cells in the blood of mice 30 days after infection. This did not reveal any obvious differences for PD1 upon treatment with recArg1 (Figure S6J). Strikingly, treatment with recArg1 significantly ameliorated virus-induced CD8 T-cell-mediated tissue damage as determined by reduced serum concentration of ALT and AST (Figures 6H and 6I). We conclude that modulation of the systemic arginine-to-ornithine ratio regulates antiviral T cell responses to ameliorate virus-induced tissue damage.",

Our study identified an IFNAR1-dependent mechanism whereby hepatocytes receive instructions to repress the transcription of genes with metabolic function. The role of IFN-repressed genes in disease and homeostasis is still poorly understood. Yet it is noticeable that IFN-I-driven expression signatures from other organs and cell types do not appear to feature similar global repressive gene regulation (Mostafavi et al., 2016, Schoggins et al., 2011). This potentially highlights a unique feature of the liver, which rapidly integrates inflammatory cues from the environment to modulate its intrinsic metabolism and, as a consequence, its systemic metabolic output to peripheral organs. This IFNAR1-mediated metabolic reprogramming of the liver may give rise to an unfavorable environment for pathogens (Sanchez et al., 2018), optimize the metabolic milieu for mounting adaptive immune responses (Ma et al., 2017), or instruct tissue repair and regeneration to prevent extensive tissue pathology. None of these options are mutually exclusive, and host damage control may be achieved by modulating disease tolerance and/or reducing immune effectors (Medzhitov, 2008).",

Fumarate can subsequently be metabolized to aspartate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate, two major precursors of de novo amino acid synthesis.

Otc and Ass1 are also crucial for de novo arginine synthesis. As a result, many tumors are auxotrophic for arginine, which renders arginine a metabolic vulnerability that is currently therapeutically exploited by recArg1 treatment of cancer patients (De Santo et al., 2018). In line, UCDs and in particular Ass1 deficiency of tumors potentially synergize with checkpoint blockade treatment in tumors (Lee et al., 2018). Interestingly, reduced serum levels of arginine are associated with less liver tissue damage in chronic HBV infection although increased serum levels of arginine and arginine derivatives have been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Dumas et al., 2014, Li et al., 2011, Pallett et al., 2015, Soga et al., 2011). Finally, deregulated ornithine metabolism and increased synthesis of polyamines may also impact cellular proliferation as well as the replication of diverse groups of viruses, potentially impacting on infection-associated cancer formation and progression (Casero et al., 2018, Mounce et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Using different approaches, we demonstrate that virus-induced IFNAR1 signaling in hepatocytes leads to downregulation of Otc and Ass1. The simultaneous upregulation of Arg1 during viral infection of the liver suggests that, during infection, hepatocytes are reprogrammed toward increased arginine degradation and ornithine accumulation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that infiltrating immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), may contribute to increased Arg1 expression in the liver (Gabrilovich, 2017). In line with this, our 13C6 heavy-isotope-labeling experiments confirmed that viral infection increases the hepatic conversion of arginine to ornithine and correlates with systemic accumulation of ornithine and citrulline. The observed infection-dependent reduction of the urea cycle end product 13C5 arginine further supported the notion of an IFNAR1-mediated break of the urea cycle. Still, these results do not rule out the potential additional contributions of extrahepatic events, as changes in the endocrine system are likely co-occurring with systemic metabolic reprogramming and/or sickness behavior during infection. Previous studies also established a link between hepatic autophagy, hepatocyte-derived circulating ARG1, and the systemic arginine-to-ornithine ratio, leading to reduced tumor growth in mice (Poillet-Perez et al., 2018). These lines of evidence suggest that endogenous metabolic reprogramming of the urea cycle modulates the pathophysiology during infectious disease. Our results may also provide a potential explanation for why many non-hepatotropic infections result in concomitant hepatitis (Adams and Hubscher, 2006, Lalazar and Ilan, 2014). Taken together, our study provides evidence for an infection-induced reprogramming of the urea cycle in hepatocytes, a central metabolic pathway in the liver, leading to hyperammonemia alongside with the deregulation of systemic metabolism. We identified hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling as a key regulator of circulating levels of arginine and ornithine to fine-tune adaptive immunity. This endogenous cytokine-driven mechanism of immunomodulation and host protection across organs could be targeted to ameliorate tissue pathology in infectious and inflammatory diseases.",

The first run included biological replicates from day 2 and day 8 after infection along with the uninfected controls. The second run included replicate samples of uninfected controls, day 30 and day 60 after infection. To account for the effect of aging, the third run included uninfected controls at day 0 and day 123, along with infected samples from day 123 (all in biological replicates). Identical uninfected controls (day 0) were included in all three TMT 6-plex runs as an internal control to monitor reproducibility between the runs. Liver tissues were homogenized (TissueLyser II, QIAGEN) in 1.5 mL 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.5 supplemented with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce Biotechnology, Thermo Scientific, IL). Further processing was adapted from a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method previously described (Manza et al., 2005, Wisniewski et al., 2009). For each sample, 100 \u03bcg of the liver tissue lysate was reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and transferred into VIVACON 500 filter unit (Vivaproucts, Littleton, MA). SDS-containing buffer was removed from the sample by centrifugation and exchanged with 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Proteins were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide and washed with 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Finally, porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for protein digestion in an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100 w/w.",

HPLC solvent A consisted of 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 in 5% acetonitrile. Peptides were separated at flow rate of 100 \u03bcL/min and eluted from the column with a non-linear gradient ranging from 0 to 100% solvent B (20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 in 90% acetonitrile). Seventy-two time-based fractions were collected, acidified, and pooled into 50 HPLC vials based on the UV trace. After removal of organic solvent in a vacuum centrifuge, samples were reconstituted to 10 \u03bcL with 5% formic acid (Bennett et al., 2011). Individual fractions were further analyzed at pH 2.4 by Agilent 1200 nano-HPLC system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA) coupled to a hybrid LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Data were acquired utilizing the Xcalibur software version 2.1. Briefly, single fractions were loaded onto a trap column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 \u03bcm, 5 \u00d7 0.3 mm, Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, CA) with a binary pump at a flow rate of 45 \u03bcL/min. Solvents for LCMS separation were composed of 0.1% trifluoracetic acid (TFA) in water (solvent A) and 0.1% TFA in 70% methanol and 20% isopropanol (solvent B). The peptides were eluted by back-flushing from the trap column onto a 16 cm fused silica analytical column with an inner diameter of 50 \u03bcm packed with C18 reversed-phase material (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 3 \u03bcm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany). Elution was achieved with a 27 min gradient ranging from 3 to 30% solvent B, followed by a 25 min gradient from 30 to 70% solvent B and, finally, a 7 min gradient from 70 to 100% solvent B at a constant flow rate of 100 nL/min. The analysis was performed in a data-dependent acquisition mode. The 10 most intense ions were isolated and fragmented by high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) for peptide identification and relative quantitation of TMT reporter ions. Dynamic exclusion for selected ions was 60 s and a single lock mass at m/z 445.120024 (Si(CH3)2O)6)20 (Olsen et al., 2005) was used for internal mass calibration with the target loss mass abundance of 0%. Maximal ion accumulation time allowed was 500 ms and overfilling of the C-trap was prevented by automatic gain control set to 106 ions for a full FTMS scan and 5 \u00d7 105 ions for MSn HCD. Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at resolution of 30,000 with the signal threshold of 2,000 counts for triggering an MSMS event. The maximum ion scan time was set to 200 ms for acquiring 1 microscan at a resolution of 7500.",

We used the Cell Ranger (v3.0.2) 10X Genomics software to demultiplex the raw sequencing data and align them to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome. We proceeded with the analysis of the UMI counts using the R Bioconductor package Seurat v3.1.0 (Stuart et al., 2019). The two samples, uninfected and 2 days post infection, were merged and processed together. Cells with more than 30% mitochondrial content were discarded. Mitochondrial genes, as well as genes that were not detected in more than 1 cell were discarded. We used markers for Kupffer (Clec4f, Csf1r, C1qc, C1qa, C1qb), endothelial (Kdr, Egfl7, Igfbp7, Aqp1) and hepatocyte (Apoa1, Apob, Pck1, G6pc, Ttr) cells for cell identification (Halpern et al., 2017). In order to focus on hepatocytes, we kept only those cells that had a summed expression of hepatocyte markers greater than both the summed expression of Kupffer as well as endothelial cells markers. We also eliminated cells that had less than 0.5% of Alb reads. The normalization of the UMI counts was performed with the SCTransform from the Seurat Package, with the regression variable on the condition (uninfected and 2 dpi) (Hafemeister and Satija, 2019). We further ran PCA on the normalized counts and the 3.000 most variable genes. Based on the Jack Straw method we selected the first 20 principal components explaining most of the variability and proceeded with a UMAP low-dimensional projection. Differential analysis between the 2 conditions was performed using the FindMarkers function in Seurat, based on the Wilcox test with a Bonferroni correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed if they had an absolute average log2 fold-change greater than 0.2 and an adjusted p value smaller than 0.05.",

All metabolite abundances inferior to the limit of detection (LOD) were replaced with a value equal to half the LOD. We eliminated all metabolites that did not have an average abundance superior to LOD in at least one condition. Modulation of metabolites was assessed through a t test between conditions. The cutoffs for the modulation were obtained based on all the inter-replica pairwise comparisons of wild-type uninfected samples. The 2.5 and 97.5 quartiles of these inter-replica log fold-change were used to define the cutoffs. The cutoffs were \u22120.44 and 0.65 for the whole liver dynamics serum metabolite measurements. For serum measurements of Ifnar1\u0394/\u0394 and Ifnar1+/+ mice at 1.5 days post infection, based on the same approach, we have set the cutoffs at \u22120.73 and 0.4.

For the interaction model (2x2 factorial design) of naive versus LCMV-infected Ifnar1\u0394/\u0394 and Ifnar1+/+, we implemented limma\u2019s interaction model as a two (Ifnar1+/+, Ifnar1\u0394/\u0394) by two (naive, LCMV-infected) factorial design.
