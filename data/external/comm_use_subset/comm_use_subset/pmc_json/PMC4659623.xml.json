            "text": "Worldwide, scavenging bird populations are rapidly declining [1\u20133]. Currently over half of the world\u2019s vulture species are facing the threat of extinction [4] with several populations having already decreased by over 95% [5, 6]. In Africa, eight species of vulture have declined by an average of 62% in recent decades [7]. Scavenging bird species provide vital ecosystem services including decreasing the spread of disease, recycling of nutrients through the environment and reducing the costs associated with carcass disposal [8, 9]. As scavenging bird populations decline throughout the world, infectious diseases, including rabies, plague and canine distemper, are expected to increase [10\u201312]. Recent attention has focused on pharmaceutical drug residues, poisons aimed at predators, lead from ammunition and other toxins in animal remains serving as food resources [13\u201319], which all contribute to mortality, in addition to other causes of death such as human persecution and utility line collision [4, 16, 20]. Infectious diseases have been a less common focus of investigations and there are relatively few accounts of infectious diseases as a direct cause of mortality in avian scavengers. West Nile virus (WNV) was determined to be the cause of death for two California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) in California [16] and Newcastle disease virus has been implicated in the death of a bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatu) in Israel [21]. Given the ongoing declines in scavenging birds, baseline information on infectious disease exposure will be useful for monitoring population health, investigating future disease-related epidemics, and informing conservation efforts needed for species in decline.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated exposure to avian pathogens in three species of birds that commonly scavenge on carrion: the California condor, which is restricted to areas in northern Mexico and the western United States [22]; the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), which is widespread throughout the Americas [23]; and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), which is found mainly in western North America [24]. Unlike California condors and turkey vultures, which are obligate scavengers, golden eagles are facultative scavengers feeding on both carrion and live prey. The California condor is currently listed as critically endangered [25] and an intensive captive breeding program initiated in the 1980s [26, 27] has succeeded in the reintroduction of free-flying condor populations in California, Arizona and Baja California, Mexico [28]. Lead poisoning has been a primary cause of mortality in condors, and, other than WNV, infectious diseases have not been reported as an important cause of morbidity or mortality in this species [16, 29, 30]. Because WNV can be fatal in California condors, the captive and free-flying populations in California are vaccinated against this disease with a recombinant DNA vaccine [31, 32] being used prior to and during our study period. Serologic titers are measured annually in captive and free-flying condors and individuals are re-vaccinated as needed. Even with vaccination, the species is vulnerable to this disease as evidenced by the WNV-related death of a condor that had been vaccinated twice against WNV [16].",

Furthermore, populations consisting mainly of captive-reared individuals, such as California condors, could have increased vulnerability to infectious disease if they are immunologically na\u00efve to pathogens circulating in free-flying sympatric species. Additionally, the California condor experienced a severe population bottleneck prior to extirpation in the wild and the subsequent decline in genetic variability [33, 34] can be associated with decreased resistance to disease [35\u201337]. Viability of small populations are highly susceptible to epidemic mortality events, and a baseline understanding of pathogen exposure in the California condor population is critical to informing management and recovery efforts, especially as condors expand their range and encounter new risks [17].",

Additionally, these species may serve as sentinels for infectious disease risk for species of conservation concern, such as California condors.",

            "text": "Here, in our serosurvey, we evaluated exposure to avian pathogens that have been reported to cause disease in a variety of wild bird species, including avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Arkansas (Ark), Connecticut (Conn) and Massachusetts (Mass) strains), Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, avian paramyxovirus-1 (AVPM-1, Newcastle Disease virus), avian paramyxovirus-2 (AVPM-2), avian paramyxovirus-3 (AVPM-3), avian reovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and WNV [21, 41\u201351]. Adenoviruses have been implicated in outbreaks involving three species of falcons which resulted in severe disease and death of numerous birds [46, 52], and exposure to adenoviruses has been detected in common buzzards (Buteo buteo) [44]. Chlamydophila psittaci, which can result in fatal respiratory disease in some avian species, has been previously isolated from many species of wild birds, including raptors [50, 53]. Infectious bronchitis virus, which causes severe respiratory disease in poultry is a coronavirus and genetically similar viruses have been detected in wild birds [54, 55]. Mycoplasma gallisepticum and M. synoviae are economically important pathogens in poultry, causing respiratory disease (M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae) and synovitis (M. synoviae). Mycoplasma gallisepticum has been associated with respiratory disease in peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) [56] and other wild avian species [57]. In the late 1990\u2019s, M. gallisepticum emerged in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) in the eastern United States and has since spread across the USA [37]. Avian paramyxovirus-1, also known as Newcastle Disease virus, is most commonly associated with disease in poultry [58], but has also been found in both clinically affected [21] and healthy raptors [59] as well as many other species of wild birds [60]. Avian paramyxovirus-2 primarily affects poultry, causing respiratory and reproductive disease in turkeys and chickens [61\u201363]. However, APMV-2 has also been reported in several wild bird species including mallard ducks [64], passerines [65] and raptors [66]. Avian paramyxovirus-3 also causes reproductive disease in turkeys [58], and has been reported in multiple species of wild birds [43, 67]. Reoviruses are associated with many disease processes and high mortality in various wild bird species [42, 68, 69]. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoal parasite that clinically affects many avian species [41, 70] and was reported to cause fatal myocarditis of a bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) [71].",

Samples were kept cool on ice for transport back to the University of California, Davis where they were aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C until shipment to the diagnostic laboratories. Serological testing for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Arkansas (Ark), Connecticut (Conn) and Massachusetts (Mass) strains), Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, avian paramyxovirus-1 (Newcastle Disease virus), avian paramyxovirus-2, avian paramyxovirus-3, and avian reovirus was performed at Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (College Station, TX) using assays optimized for poultry species. Because these assays have not been validated in condors, vultures, or eagles, we relied on cut-off titers established for poultry. Exposure to avian adenovirus was evaluated using an agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test. Chlamydophila psittaci exposure status was determined by a direct complement fixation (DCF) assay. Exposure status for the three strains of IBV was determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. A titer of 1:16 or greater was considered positive for exposure to IBV. Mycoplasma gallisepticum exposure status was determined using serial tests. Samples were initially screened using a plate agglutination assay. Any samples that were positive on the first assay were then tested by HI. A titer of 1:80 or above on the HI assay was considered positive. A sample testing positive on both the plate agglutination test and HI assay was considered positive for exposure to M. gallisepticum. Mycoplasma synoviae exposure status was determined in the same manner as M. gallisepticum. Avian paramyxovirus 1, 2 and 3 exposure status was determined by HI. A titer of 1:16 or greater on the HI assay was considered positive for each of the three paramyxoviruses. Avian reovirus exposure status was determined using AGID. The number of individuals tested varied between pathogens due to limitations in sample volume.",

The PRNT assays were performed using >75 plaque forming units of virus grown on Vero cell culture. To be considered positive, sera had to neutralize >90% of the virus in at least a 1:4 dilution. Sera from free-flying California condors were also evaluated for active WNV infection by real time-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) using primers as previously described [79, 80].

The two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare seroprevalences between free-flying condor release locations, between the three scavenger bird species, and between captive and free-flying condors. West Nile virus serostatus among free-flying California condors was evaluated for associations with sex, age (years), rearing site, time since last vaccination (never vaccinated, \u2264 3 years and > 3 years), number of previous vaccines (range: 0\u20134), and release location using logistic regression analysis (n = 85 condors). Five condors had been free-flying initially and were then brought into captivity for medical treatment for various reasons including lead exposure, microtrash, or injury. Because these individuals might differ from the others in terms of their overall health, which may affect their response to WNV vaccination, they were excluded from the analysis. Six other individuals had insufficient sample volume for WNV serology. Rearing site was defined as the location where the individual spent the majority of its first year of life: the Los Angeles Zoo; San Diego Zoo Safari Park; sites outside of California including the Oregon Zoo and the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho; and the wild (reference category). Each of the variables was first assessed in univariable logistic regression models. Predictor variables with p-values of \u2264 0.2 in the univariable models, in addition to potential confounding variables, were included in the multivariable analysis. Biologically plausible two-way interactions were also assessed for significance. Multivariable models were evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and multicollinearity among the predictor variables was assessed using variance inflation factors (VIF). Overall model fit was evaluated using the Hosmer Lemeshow test [88]. Spearman\u2019s rank correlation was used to test the association between time since previous vaccination and age, as well as time since previous vaccination and number of vaccinations. Statistical analyses were performed using R (version 2.15.1, R-development Core team, http://www.r-project.org).",

However, age and time since vaccination were not significant in the multivariable logistic regression model. An increasing number of previous vaccinations was positively associated with WNV seropositivity in the univariable models, though the association was not statistically significant (P = 0.194). Number of previous vaccinations was not included in the final model because it was significantly correlated with time since vaccination (\u03c1 = 0.493, P < 0.001) and inclusion of the variable in the model did not improve model fit.

Because the test used for IBV is not validated in any of the species tested here, it is possible that antibodies to similar viruses were cross-reacting with the IBV tests. Infectious bronchitis virus, which is primarily a poultry pathogen, is a group 3 coronavirus and these viruses, including some genetically similar to IBV, have been detected in various wild bird species [54, 55]. Also, there is evidence that turkeys can be infected experimentally by group 2 coronaviruses [89]. At this time, it is unknown whether the virus responsible for the high seroprevalence of IBV is specific to condors or if it has spilled over from another species. Further investigation is needed to understand these serologic results and characterize coronaviruses that could be infecting condors.",

Some condors at the SDZSP and LAZ are housed outside where there is potential for contact with house finches. Isolation and characterization of M. gallisepticum from captive condors and house finches at the zoo are needed to better understand potential disease transmission between these species.

In the multivariable model, release location and rearing site were associated with WNV serostatus in free-flying condors, while previous vaccination for WNV was not predictive of serologic status. Southern California birds and those raised at LAZ were the most likely to be seropositive for WNV. These findings could be attributed to the geographic distribution of WNV activity in California. In 2010, the year in which the free-flying condors were sampled, Los Angeles and Kern counties in southern California had significant WNV activity in birds, horses and humans, while the western counties of central California\u2014San Luis Obispo, Monterey and San Benito\u2014had no WNV activity reported for the year [92].",

Also, the relatively small number of condors that were not vaccinated against WNV, 16, of which six were seropositive, combined with the effect of natural exposure on titer may have resulted in our inability to detect an association between vaccination and serostatus. California condors receiving two vaccinations spaced three weeks apart have been reported to produce a strong antibody response by 60 days post vaccination [93]. However, a single WNV vaccination in other susceptible species, the western scrub jay (Aphelocoma californica) and island scrub jay (Aphelocoma insularis), has been reported to have minimal effect on titer [94, 95]. Age was significantly associated with seropositivity in condors released in Big Sur and Southern California. In addition, seropositive condors had significantly greater time since vaccination compared to seronegative condors. Natural exposure to WNV has been shown to produce strong antibody responses in other avian species such as the western scrub jay [95] and WNV titers in California condors have been long lasting, up to 416 days post-vaccination [93]. Thus, it is not surprising that older condors are more likely to be seropositive for WNV as a result of strong antibody responses to WNV upon natural exposure.",
