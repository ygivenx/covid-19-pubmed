Diagnostic methods reliably identifying patients with a higher risk of death are urgently needed in order to provide timely treatment and improve cost-efficacy of intensive care [2]. Since reliable concepts and accurate measurements to rate mortality risk and stratify severity of septic patients are insufficient [3, 4], a classification system named PIRO was developed to stratify patients on the basis of their predisposition, the nature and extent of insult/infection, nature and magnitude of response, and degree of concomitant organ dysfunction [5, 6]. Multiple host and pathogen-associated characteristics are utilized in this system to predict outcome. Similar diagnostic concepts also exist in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Zheng diagnosis.",
