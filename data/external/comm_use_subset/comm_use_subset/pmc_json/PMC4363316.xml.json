Recent studies indicate that numerous cellular miRNAs play a regulatory role in the interaction network between the host and viruses. The host-encoded miRNAs can regulate the process of viral infection by targeting the viral genome or host genome; e.g., host-encoded miRNAs can promote or inhibit DNA replication of the virus [12]. Recently, the miRNAs regulation in of the immune response by miRNAs has been observed. Evidence suggested that miRNAs are also involved in the mammalian immune response, and play an important role in antiviral processes.",

To predict the putative TGEV targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs, the miRNA target gene database miRGen 3.0 was used with stringent criteria. The results showed that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs directly targeted the 3' UTR or 5' UTR of the TGEV genome: ssc-miR-28\u20133p, ssc-miR-126\u20135p and ssc-miR-30b-5p target the 3' UTR (28297 bp\u201328571 bp) and ssc-miR-2411 and chrX-16275 target the 5' UTR (1 bp\u2013303 bp) (Fig. 5). This study also found a series of miRNAs that target host-encoded pre-miRNAs; for example, ssc-miR-9, ssc-miR-19a, ssc-miR-142\u20135p, ssc-miR-134 and ssc-miR-20c-5p all target ssc-mir-21. GO annotation was performed for the target genes of five designated differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-146b, miR-155\u20135p, miR-195, miR-124a and miR-1306\u20135p). The results showed that the differential expressed miRNAs and their target genes constituted a complex regulatory network: multiple miRNAs were linked through their common target genes. This complex regulatory network could regulate the expression of multiple genes through one miRNA, but could also regulate the expression of certain genes through several miRNAs in combination (S1 Fig. and S2 Fig.). For example, the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs, miR-9, miR-9\u20131 and miR-9\u20132 all target IL12A, but the immune-related gene IL7R was individually regulated by miR-140\u20133p. The in-depth analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism in gene expression will contribute to our understanding of the complexity of eukaryote genomes and gene regulatory networks.",

Similar to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) also belongs to the genus Coronavirus, family Coronavirus, Nidovirales. The clinical symptoms caused by the infection of these two viruses are quite similar, TGEV and PEDV infection have caused serious damage to the farming industry [20, 21]; however, compared with other Coronavirus, research on TGEV still lags behind. Currently, there are no commercial biological products for TGEV infection, and there is also no effective treatment for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis.
