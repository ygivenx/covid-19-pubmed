Subtle time patterns of occurrence of phenomena of\ndifferent nature can be detected, as well as changes in its periodicity.

In Brazil, palivizumab has been recommended based on the\nfirst studies regarding RSV seasonality, mainly performed in the South and Southeast\nstates (ANVISA 2011). In 2013, the Brazilian\nMinistry of Health included palivizumab as a drug freely distributed by the Brazilian\nPublic Health System for use in premature babies (gestational age less or equal than 32\nweeks) and infants less than 2 years old with chronic lung disease or congenital heart\ndisease with demonstrated hemodynamic repercussion. Every state and region can establish\nthe optimal period for starting the use of immunobiologicals, accounting for the\nregional climate specificities and epidemiological evidences (MS 2012). The recent revision of guidelines by the Ministry of\nHealth in 2015 proposed a readjustment of the periods of provision of immunobiologicals\nin the different regions of the country (MS\n2015). Our results reinforce this revision for provision of palivizumab in\ndifferent regions, as suggested by others studies in Brazil (Vieira et al. 2001, Paiva et al.\n2012) and others regions (Panozzo et al.\n2010, Blom-Feshbach et al. 2013).\nResults over the period for availability of palivizumab in the Midwest and Southeast\n(January) do not match exactly with those suggested by Ministry of Health (February).\nAlthough there are differences of one month only, these are densely populated regions.\nThe readjustment of the immunisation schedule with palivizumab aims to ensure the\nprotection of higher risk children, while avoiding the waste of this expensive\nimmunobiological.",

Another limitation of this study was the low mean positivity found from the\ntests, which depended on several factors independent of the epidemiological situation,\nsuch as the quality of sample collection and transportation, in addition to the\nsensitivity of the test used.
