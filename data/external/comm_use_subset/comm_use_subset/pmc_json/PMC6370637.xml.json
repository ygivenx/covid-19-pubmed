            "text": "Cytotoxic CD8+ T Lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial for controlling viruses and tumors. However, in several chronic viral infections, such as Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of humans or Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Friend virus (FV) infection of mice, virus-specific CD8+ T cells become functionally exhausted. There is compelling evidence that this T cell exhaustion contributes significantly to the establishment of viral chronicity. The functional impairment of CTLs is associated with the expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors and is a result of signaling from these receptors after binding to their ligands (1). The therapeutic prevention of the interaction between inhibitory ligands and checkpoint receptors with blocking antibodies reconstituted the functionality of exhausted cells during chronic infection and in some malignancies (1, 2). The so far most important and best characterized inhibitory receptor is the Programmed Cell Death Receptor-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. Interestingly, activated virus-specific CD8+ T cells enhance the expression of PD-1 already very early after antigen stimulation (3). During many acute viral infections activated PD-1 positive effector cells are not exhausted (4). The expansion of PD-1 expressing CD8+ T cells with full effector functions has been reported during the acute infections of humans with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) (5), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (6), or Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (7) as well as in monkeys infected with Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (8), or SIV-HIV hybrid virus (SHIV) (9). In experiments, LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells with PD-1 knockout were transferred into LCMV-infected mice and subsequently developed exhaustion, enhanced proliferation during early infection, and enhanced apoptosis (10). Furthermore, the SIV study provides evidence that T cell receptor stimulation itself induces PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells (8).",

            "text": "In the current study, the murine Friend retrovirus model was used to characterize the effects of PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint receptor expressed on CTLs or its ligand PD-L1 for the regulation of these cells during an acute infection. FV is an oncogenic retroviral complex that can induce erythroleukemia in susceptible mice. However, resistant mouse strains, like the C57BL/6 mice that were used in this study, mount a potent anti-viral immune response during the acute phase of infection that prevents the onset of leukemia (11). Despite this efficient initial viral immunity, FV eventually escapes from T cell mediated immune control and establishes a chronic infection (12). We previously showed that activated CD8+ T cells up-regulate the expression of PD-1 but remain fully functional during the first 2 weeks of FV infection (4). These cells were highly cytotoxic but sensitive to PD-1 mediated suppression. The signal that progressively induced T cell exhaustion in the CD8+ T cell population came from PD-L1 expressing virus-infected cells. FV infection up-regulated PD-L1 in a subset of CTL target cells, which subsequently escaped elimination by PD-1high CTLs and consequently suppressed their functionality (13). In previous studies it was also shown that regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) (14) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (15) were involved in the functional down-regulation of CTLs during the late phase of acute infection. Despite growing numbers of studies analyzing the role of PD-1 during chronic infections, the functional effects of this receptor and its ligand during the early phase of antiviral immune responses remain incompletely understood. In the current study PD-1\u2212/\u2212 and PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice with gene defects in the respective genes were used for the analysis of the effects of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on the virus-specific CTL response during an acute viral infection. We observed that mainly PD-1 regulated the magnitude of the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response, and in this way, determined the efficacy of antiviral immunity. The current study provides new data about the functional role of inhibitory checkpoint receptors during an acute viral infection.",

These FV induced activated CD8+ T cells (CD69+, CD44+, CD62L\u2212) were defined by their expression of a glycosylated form of the CD43 molecule (29). To test whether the deficiency for the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway influences acute T cell immunity, wild type (WT) C57BL/6J mice, PD-1\u2212/\u2212 and PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice were infected with FV. In these mice the effector CD8+ CD43+ T cells and CD8+ T cells specific for the H-2Db\u2013restricted Friend murine leukemia virus\u2013glycosylated immundominant gag epitope (tetramer+) (18) were characterized. Spleen and bone marrow (BM) are the organs with the highest virus replication during the acute phase of FV infection (14). Both these organs were analyzed on days 0 (uninfected), 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 15 after FV inoculation. The expansion of effector CD8+CD43+ T cells in WT mice and both knockout (KO) mouse strains started at day 6 after infection (Figure 1A). However, in KO mice the frequencies of T cells with effector phenotypes were enhanced in the spleen at day 6 after infection. It is interesting that in the BM the population of effector CD8+ T cells expanded two days later at day 8 after infection (Figure 1B). At day 10 after FV infection effector CD8+ CD43+ T cell numbers peaked in both organs of all analyzed mouse strains with the exception of spleens from PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice. At peak expansion the frequency of effector CD8+ CD43+ T cells from PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 was 2.3 times higher than that in WT mice and in PD-1\u2212/\u2212 the frequency of effector cells was 1.4 times higher than in WT mice. In contrast to the peak levels of effector CD8+ T cells in WT and PD-1 KO mice at day 10, the numbers of effector cells continued to grow until day 15 after FV infection in the spleen of PD-L1 KO mice. This group was a clear exception, as the T cell contraction phase started much later than in WT or PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Since PD-1 and especially PD-L1 deficiency influenced the frequencies of virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells during acute FV infection, we analyzed if this had an effect of the viral load kinetics. The replication of FV was reduced in the spleens of PD-1\u2212/\u2212 (Figure 1E) and in the BM (Figure 1F) of PD-L1\u2212/\u2212mice before CD8+ T cells expanded, suggesting that these effects might not be associated with effector T cell responses. However, at day 8 after infection, as well as day 10 in the spleen, viral loads were significantly higher in WT mice compared to animals deficient for PD-1 or PD-L1, which might reflect differences in CD8+ T cell responses. At later time points no differences in viral loads were observed between the mouse strains, with the exception of a low viral load in PD-1 KO mice at day 12 in the BM (Figure 1F). Thus, the reduction in viral loads in both KO mice at day 8 and 10 after FV infection may be a result of an accelerated expansion of effector CD8+ T cells in mice without PD-1 signaling.",

Therefore, in the following experiments we decided to focus on the role of PD-L1 on the functionality of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. In these cells the effects of PD-L1 knockout on the production of different cytotoxic molecules was characterized in greater detail. It is known that polyfunctional CD8+ T cells simultaneously producing different cytokines correlates with the long-term control of HIV in elite controllers (31). However, the role of polyfunctionality regarding the production of different granzymes by T cells has not been characterized. The granzymes produced by antiviral CTLs have a different spectrum of target proteins and mediate a diverse range of cytotoxic, proinflammatory, and antiviral functions (32). To characterize the simultaneous production of different granzymes, the frequency of CD8+ CD43+ T cells expressing granzyme A (GzmA), GzmB, and granzyme K (GzmK) were determined in the spleen of WT and PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 8 (Figure 3A), day 10 (Figure 3B), and day 12 (Figure 3C) after FV infection. Significantly more CTLs from PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice produced GzmB or GzmK at day 8 after FV infection (Figure 3A). The frequencies of CD8+ CD43+ T cells, which were GzmA+ GzmB+ or GzmB+ GzmK+ double-positive, were also significantly higher in the PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mouse strain. Two days later at day 10 after infection the frequencies of effector cells producing all three granzymes were also significantly higher in mice without PD-L1. At day 12 after infection significant differences were observed only in the frequencies of total effector cells producing single GzmA and GzmB. The population of FV-specific Tetramer+ CD8+ T cells was also analyzed for the production of different granzymes molecules. At day 8 after infection significantly more virus-specific CD8+ T cells from the spleens of PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 than WT mice produced GzmK or all three Gzms simultaneously (Figure 3D). Similar results were obtained on day 10 after infection (Figure 3E). Interesting, at the late time point day 12 after FV infection significant differences were only found for the production of single Gzms (GzmA, GzmB) (Figure 3F). The analysis of the PD-L1 effects on the production of Gzms showed a clear influence of the pathway on Gzm expression during the acute phase of antiviral T cell responses. During the early expansion of T cells and control of FV infection the PD-1 signaling pathway suppressed the simultaneous production of different Gzms in effector CD8+ cells.",

In the PD-1 and PD-L1 KO mice all cells are deficient for these molecules, so we cannot distinguish between direct or indirect effects on CD8+ T cells. For example, the absence of PD-L1 has a significant effect on the differentiation of myeloid cells (33). The following experiment was designed to test the direct influence of PD-L1 on the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells. CD8+ T cells were isolated from the spleens of CD45.1 \u00d7 TCR-Tg mice (T cell receptor transgenic mice, with CD8+ T cells that recognize the immunodominant gagL epitope of FV) and were transferred into WT or PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice 1 day prior to FV infection (Figure 4A). The expansion of transferred cells was characterized on day 8 and day 12 after infection by staining for CD45.1+ CD8+ T cells. Most of the expanded CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells from 8 days FV-infected WT and PD-L1-/- mice upregulated PD-1 on the cell surface (Figure 4B). Thus, this checkpoint receptor may be involved in the regulation of expanded virus-specific cells from donor mice. At day 8 after infection, the numbers of CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the spleen and BM of infected PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to WT mice (Figures 4C,D). Also numbers of CD8+CD45.1+ T cells producing GzmB in the spleen and BM of PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly higher than in WT mice at day 8 after FV infection (Figures 4E,F). In contrast, at day 12 after infection the numbers of transferred virus-specific CD8+ T cells and the numbers of cells producing of GzmB were similar in both groups of mice. Thus, the transfer experiment confirmed the data from PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice that the expansion and functional maturation of CD8+ T cells during the early phase of an acute infection is regulated by the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway.",

For a detailed characterization of the molecular mechanisms regulated by PD-L1, a global analysis of the CD8+ T cell proteome was performed by label-free quantification using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). FV-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated from TCR-Tg-CD45.1 mice and transferred into WT or PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice. One day after transfer the recipients were infected with FV. Expanded donor CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells were sorted from splenocytes at day 12 after FV infection. Cells were lysed and subjected to proteome analysis. 2673 proteins were quantitated and compared between CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells isolated from WT vs. PD-L1 KO mice (Supplementary Table 1. Excel data). From all these proteins, only 40 molecules significantly changed expression levels in the absence of PD-L1 (Figures 5A,B; Supplementary Table 2). The concentration of 37 proteins was reduced and only three proteins [General transcription factor IIE subunit 1 (Gtf2e1), Pyridoxal kinase (Pdxk), and U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 14 homolog A (Utp14a)] were enhanced in virus-specific CD8+ T cells isolated from PD-L1 KO mice compared to WT mice. From these differently expressed proteins 8 are involved in regulation of the cell cycle [indicated by functional analysis using DAVID (26, 27)] and the expression of caspase 3 was reduced in cells isolated from PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that proliferation and apoptosis of T cells might be affected by PD-L1.",

We analyzed the expression of Ki67 as a marker of proliferation (34) and the expression of activated caspase 3 as marker for apoptosis (35) in virus-specific CD8+ T cells from the spleen and BM of WT, PD-1\u2212/\u2212, and PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice. At day 8 after FV infection, the frequency of CD8+ tetramer+ T cells expressing Ki67 was slightly enhanced, but not significantly different in both KO mouse strains compared to WT mice (Figure 5C). However, the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 was significantly enhanced in PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 10 and 12 after infection. In PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice significantly enhanced numbers of proliferating CD8+ T cells were only observed at day 12 after infection. Thus, an enhanced proliferation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells between day 10 and 12 after FV infection likely explains the higher number of effector T cells in both KO mouse strains. The other possible mechanism, which determines the quantity of effector cells, is the programmed death of these cells The expression of activated caspase 3, a key enzyme for the induction of apoptosis, was analyzed in the spleen of day 8 FV infected B6, PD-1\u2212/\u2212, and PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 5D). 13% of the CD8+ tetramer+ T cells expressed the activated caspase 3 enzyme in WT mice, whereas only 6% of the virus-specific CD8+ T cells from PD-1\u2212/\u2212 and 4% from PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice expressed caspase 3. This significant differences in CD8+ T cell number expressing the activated form of caspase 3 provides evidence that PD-1 signaling may also regulate apoptosis in virus-specific CD8+ T cells. To prove that apoptosis regulates the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in acutely FV-infected mice, animals were treated twice with the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (24) on day 6 and 7 after infection. The inhibition of caspases and subsequent reduction of apoptosis led to increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen (Figure 5E) and BM (Figure 5F) of treated mice at 8 days post infection. Thus, apoptosis plays an important role in regulating CD8+ T cell number during acute FV infection and PD-1 signaling influences levels of apoptosis.",

            "text": "Our current data show that both PD-1 receptor deficiency as well as PD-1 ligand deficiency influences CD8+ T cell responses during an acute viral infection. Interestingly, the effect of PD-L1 knockout was stronger in almost all measurements than the effect of PD-1 knockout, which raised the question what is the difference between the two mouse models. It was previously shown that CD80 expressed on activated T cells may function as additional receptor of PD-L1 and delivers suppressive signals to T cells (36). In order to determine the role of CD80 as additional inhibitory receptor, we analyzed the expression of CD80 on effector and virus-specific CD8+ T cells after FV infection. Approximately 34% of the effector CD8+CD43+ T cells and 38% of the virus-specific CD8+ tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in the spleens of 10 day infected WT mice expressed CD80 on the cell surface (Figures 6A,B). So there might be a possible role of CD80 in suppressing CD8+ T cell responses. However, the treatment of FV-infected WT or PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with the blocking anti-CD80 antibody (37) did not affect the numbers of effector CD43+CD8+ T cells or virus-specific CD8+ tetramer+ T cells in the spleen or BM of FV-infected mice (Figures 6C,D). The production of GzmB by CD8+ T cells and FV viral loads were also not changed after blocking CD80 (data not shown). Thus, the CD80 expression on FV-induced effector CD8+ T cells was not involved in the PD-L1 dependent regulation of this population.",

We observed an enhanced expansion of CD8+ effector T cells in both KO mouse strains during the early acute phase of FV infection (Figure 1). PD-L1/PD-1 signaling regulated the proliferation, functional maturation, and apoptosis of virus-specific CD8+ T cells. However, CD80 was not involved in the PD-L1-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cell responses. In previous studies it was shown that deficiency in the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway or the blockade of the interaction between these molecules resulted in an enhanced elimination of the adenovirus (38), LP-BM5 immunodeficiency retrovirus (39), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) induced acute respiratory infections (40), rabies virus (41), LCMV (23), and FV (13). On the other hand the absence of PD-1 suppression during acute corona virus infection (42), murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) (43) or LCMV infection (44, 45) lead to an enhanced immunopathology and mortality of infected animals. In the case of FV infection, the main target organs of FV replication are BM and spleen. Short-term inflammation or immunopathology in these organs are usually not life-threatening for infected animals.",

            "text": "It is interesting that the frequency of effector CD8+ T cells remained high during late acute infection in PD-L1\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not in WT or PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We therefore analyzed the role of another molecule as a possible receptor for PD-L1. Previously reverse signaling from CD80 after ligation to PD-L1 was described (36). Thus, blocking anti-CD80 antibodies were used to prevent the interaction between PD-L1 and CD80 expressed on CD8+ T cells. However, the treatment of WT and PD-1\u2212/\u2212 mice with anti-CD80 antibodies did not lead to a detectible modulation of CD8+ T cell responses. The regulation of the functionality of CD8+ T cells is one important aspect of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. In the LCMV model it was previously noted that deficiency for PD-1 led to a reduced production of IFN-\u03b3 in virus-specific CD8+ T cells after stimulation with viral antigens (10). This observation was interpreted as an enhanced accumulation of \u201cexhausted\u201d terminally differentiated cells, which expressed the inhibitory receptors LAG3, CD160, 2B4, TIGIT, and Tim-3. In the FV model we previously showed that the population of PD-1high CD8+ T cells, which also co-expressed other inhibitory receptors during the course of infection, produced significantly less cytokines in response to antigen re-stimulation than PD-1low CD8+ T cells (10). In contrast, they produced high amounts of granzymes and were responsible for the elimination of FV-infected target cells. Thus, the terminal differentiation was associated with an enhanced cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. The co-expression of different inhibitory checkpoint receptors on terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells is an essential mechanisms for the control of potentially pathogenic CTLs. Interestingly, PD-1 also plays an important role in the regulation of longterm memory CD8+ T cells (10). Currently it remains elusive why PD-L1 and PD-1 KO mice show such different CD8+ T cell responses and how these molecules influence the differentiation of the memory pool of CD8+ T cells during the later phase of viral infections.",

            "text": "The effect of the PD-1 receptor on the proliferation of effector CD8+ T cells is one of the known mechanisms regulating the numbers of CTLs in infected organ (38). Apoptosis is another mechanism that determines the quantity of activated effector cells. The phenomenon of activation induced cell death (AICD) which is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders also determines the magnitude of Influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells (46). Apoptosis plays a key role in dampening immune responses and for establishing long-lasting T cell memory during the contraction phase of antiviral immune responses (47). In previous studies it was shown that PD-L1 deficiency was associated with diminished expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) in activated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (48). Moreover, a similar reduction of Bim in PD-1+ CD8+ T cells was observed in melanoma patients successfully treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies (49). However, the role of apoptosis during the expansion phase of virus-specific CTLs is not well-characterized. Activated caspase 3 is the important executor molecule managing the apoptosis process (50). This enzyme cleaves different intracellular substrate molecules and starts the cascade of irreversible changes ultimately resulting in programmed cell death. Previous studies showed that the presence of caspase 3 is a phenotypic marker of activated effector T cells and not always associated with apoptosis of these cells (51). Our findings, based on proteome analysis and flow cytometry, suggest that the level of activated caspase 3 in effector CD8+ T cells was regulated by the PD-1 receptor. Effector cells that expanded without PD-1/PD-L1 regulation expressed reduced levels of activated caspase 3 in the cytoplasm. Cells with high levels of caspase 3 expression were predisposed to apoptotic death (35). The treatment of FV-infected mice with the low molecular pan-caspase inhibitor Z/VAD-FMK resulted in enhanced numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells during the early phase FV infection. Thus, apoptosis was involved in regulating numbers of expanded effector T cells. The regulation of T cell apoptosis through PD-1/PD-L1 molecules is most likely an important mechanism determining the magnitude of the CTL responses in infected organs. The quantity of effector CD8+ T cells is one important aspect of the PD-1 regulation, whereas the functional maturation toward cytotoxic T cells is another. In the current study, we analyzed the role of PD-1 signaling for the ability of CD8+ CTLs to simultaneously produce the different cytotoxic effector molecules granzyme A, B, and K. Interestingly, effector CD8+ T cells that produced two or three granzymes simultaneously were impaired by the PD-1 checkpoint mechanism. Deficiency for PD-L1 clearly enhanced numbers and presence of polyfunctional cytotoxic cells in FV-infected organs. Thus, PD-1 signaling not only regulates the quantity of antiviral T cells through the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis, but is also critical for inhibiting the differentiation of these cells into polyfunctional cytotoxic T cells. These observations from KO mice allow us to better understand the role of PD-1 during the early phase of antiviral immune responses and may provide new strategies for the development of successful immunmodulatotry treatments of viral infections or tumors and for the development of efficient prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.",

Shown are the numbers of all effector CD43+ CD8+ T cells (A\u2013C) and virus-specific Tetramer+CD8+\n(D\u2013F) expressing single, double, or all three granzymes together. Each dot represents an individual mouse and the mean numbers and SD are indicated. Data were pooled from two independent experiments with similar results. Differences were analyzed by unpaired t-test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005).",
