Another plausible hypothesis for the convergence of the sequences derived from countries that are so far apart is the fact that the majority of the strains of BCoV contained in this cluster were isolated in cell cultures before being sequenced. Isolation in cell culture before sequencing exerts artificial selection, inducing convergent development between different samples (Borucki et al. 2013).",
