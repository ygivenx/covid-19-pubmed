In layer type birds it can cause a drop in egg production and some strains are nephropathogenic. Infectious bronchitis remains one of the most widely reported respiratory diseases of chickens worldwide despite the routine usage of attenuated live vaccines to control the disease. Control of IBV is difficult because there is little to no cross-protection between the numerous different serotypes of the virus.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome length of approximately 27 kb. The 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as several non-structural proteins [1]. The S glycoprotein of IBV forms projections on the surface of the virion. Spike is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 subunit forming the outermost portion and S2 forming a stalk-like structure that is embedded in the viral membrane. The S1 subunit contains hypervariable regions that play a role in attachment to host cell receptors, and it contains conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes [2,3]. Spike is also involved in membrane fusion and viral entry into the host cell. The E and M proteins are integral membrane proteins involved in assembly of the virus. The N protein is closely associated with the viral genome and plays a role in replication. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome, approximately 21 kb, encodes two polyproteins 1a and 1ab. A minus one frame-shift mechanism is used to translate the 1ab polyprotein. The polyproteins are post-translationally cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsp 2\u201316 (IBV does not have an nsp1) that make up the replication complex. Key nsps encoded, include a papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) within nsp 3, a main protease (Mpro) within nsp 5, and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) within nsps 11 and 12.",

High mutation rates are attributed to minimal proof reading capabilities associated with the RdRp. Recombination is thought to be due to a unique template switching \u201ccopy-choice\u201d mechanism during RNA replication [5]. Evidence of recombination among strains of IBV has been observed both experimentally and in the field [6\u201311]. The emergence of several alpha- and beta-coronaviruses has been attributed to recombination [12,13] but only recently was recombination shown to be the mechanism behind the emergence of a novel gamma-coronavirus, turkey coronavirus (TCoV) [14]. Although \u201chot spots\u201d of recombination in the genome of IBV have been reported [9,15], a thorough study of recombination using multiple different strains across the entire genome has not been conducted.",

However, evolutionary history is traditionally represented using a strictly bifurcating phylogenetic tree, which implies that nce two lineages are created they subsequently never interact with each other. When evolutionary events such as reassortment, horizontal gene transfer or recombination occur, reticulations among the phylogenetic tree branches can result. Using the Neighbor-net analysis we observed evidence of networked relationships (represented by boxes, in Figure 2) among the analyzed sequences. Since the boxes only imply the possibility of recombination, we conducted a pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test, which showed a significant difference in the compatibility between closely linked sites (p < 0.0001) supporting the occurrences of recombination among the viruses [20].",

That observation was also reported by Zhang et al. [23]. It is interesting that Mass/H52 (8 transferred fragments) and Mass/H120 (6 transferred fragments) share only 5 identical transferred fragments. The Mass/H52 and Mass/H120 viruses were isolated circa 1955 in the Netherlands and it is widely accepted that H stands for Holland, but it actually stands for Houben, the owner of the broiler farm where the viruses were isolated [24]. It is thought that Mass/H120 was derived from Mass/H52 but the actual relationship between the viruses is not certain. Our data indicates that they are not necessarily parent and progeny but they are closely related.",

            "text": "Recombination in the 1ab ORF area, which encodes the nonstructural proteins involved in the viral replication complex, has the potential to alter the pathogenicity of the virus [28]. The nsp 2 contains hydrophobic residues that likely anchor the replication complex to the Golgi [29]. The nsp 3 encodes the protease PLP2 which cleaves nsps 2, 3, and 4 and an area with ADP-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) activity. The protease PLP2 has been shown to have deubiquinating-like activity [30] and also to be a type I interferon (IFN) antagonist [31]. Changes in the amino acid composition of this area could affect the ability of the virus to replicate in a variety of cell types. The ADRP region of nsp 3 is conserved among coronaviruses [32,33], and a recent study suggested a biological role for the coronavirus ADRP in modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory immune modulators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 [34]. Recombination in this area could alter the pathogenicity of the virus by modulating host cytokine expression. The nsp16 is reported to be an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent RNA (nucleoside-2\u2032O)-methyltransferase (2\u2032O-MTase) responsible for capping the viral mRNA nascent transcripts [32]. An alteration in the efficiency of this protein could profoundly decrease not only viral replication but also pathogenicity. The spike glycoprotein of IBV on the surface of the virus plays a role in attachment to host cell receptors, membrane fusion and entry into the host cell. It also contains conformationally-dependent epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing and serotype specific antibodies [2,3]. We and others [6\u20138,10] have observed a relatively high number of breakpoints in and immediately upstream of spike, and changes to this region of the genome can result in the emergence of new genotypes and serotypes of IBV as well as new avian coronaviruses (i.e., TCoV). The envelope and matrix proteins are as ociated with virus assembly, and changes in those proteins could reduce the efficiency of virus particle formation and subsequent transmission of the virus. The 3\u2032UTR is involved with binding of the viral RdRp and viral genome replication. Changes to the 3\u2032UTR could affect replication efficiency and thus virulence of the virus.",

Breakpoints in the 1ab polyprotein gene have the potential to alter pathogenicity of the virus, and breakpoints near or in spike have the potential to lead to the emergence of new serotypes of IBV or new coronaviruses. Although the spike region determines the serotype of the virus, the remainder of the genome may be a mosaic of sequence fragments from a variety of gamma-coronaviruses. The only evidence of a gamma-coronavirus possibly recombining with an alpha or beta-coronavirus was the discovery of the mosaic nature of the SARS-coronavirus genome [35].

In addition, the IBV genomes were examined for recombination breakpoints using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP4, Version 4, Simmonics, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK) [21,22]. Unless otherwise stated, default settings were used in all of the programs. The specific algorithms used were RDP [40], GENECONV [41], BOOTSCAN/RESCAN [40], MAXIMUM CHI SQUARE [42], CHIMAERA [43], SISCAN [44], and 3Seq [45]. We used more than one method to analyze the data because evaluation of these recombination detection methods using both simulated and empirical data showed that the results from only a single method were not very reliable [46]. Automasking was used for optimal recombination detection. The RDP analysis was run without a reference and a window size of 60, BOOTSCAN window size was increased to 500, MAXCHI and CHIMAERA number of variable sites per window was increased to 120, and the window size and step size for SISCAN was increased to 500 and 20, respectively. The window sizes were increased from their default settings because IBV has a high mutation rate, which can mask recombination signals. Increasing the window size was shown to increase the ratio of recombination signals relative to mutational \u201cnoise\u201d [47].",
