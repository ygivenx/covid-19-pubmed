A recent WHO report indicates 399 million people in 11 high-burden countries and 556 million people in 12 high-burden countries are at risk for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL), respectively [1]. The incidence of human leishmaniases shows an important increase over the last decades due to multiple factors, including failing preventive and therapeutic measures, human migration caused by conflicts and political instability, global warming, and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites in developing countries [2\u20135]. Causal agents of leishmaniases are protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus belonging to the Trypanosomatidae family. During the parasite\u2019s life cycle, the promastigote form is transmitted by blood-feeding sandflies to vertebrate hosts, where they develop into the disease-causing amastigote form inside host phagocytes.",

            "text": "Control of intracellular Leishmania development relies primarily on chemotherapy but also on the ability of the parasitized host to mount an efficient immune response. The macrophage plays a key role in antiparasitic resistance but also immuno-pathology. These sentinel cells participate directly in the containment and clearance of Leishmania through their innate immune functions and stimulation of a protective Th1 response [6, 7]. Intracellular Leishmania and their host cells have coevolved intricate and dynamic interactions (Fig 1). In particular, Leishmania has evolved mechanisms to subvert both innate and adaptive immune responses that cause immune dysregulation and the pathologies characteristic of CL and VL and ultimately allow parasite proliferation and persistent infection inside the mammalian host [8\u201310]. Surprisingly, even though it is very well established that Leishmania reprograms its host cell to subvert the immune response and to meet the nutritional and metabolic needs for intracellular parasite survival and proliferation [11, 12], there is only little effort to exploit these crucial effects of the parasite on the host cell for antiparasitic drug discovery. Here, we review the current literature on antileishmanial therapy and Leishmania host\u2013pathogen interaction and discuss novel strategies to target host cell rather than parasite biology for drug discovery\u2014a strategy that likely will be more refractory to the emergence of drug-resistant parasites.",

These include the antifungal drug amphotericin B, the off-patent antibiotic paromomycin, the oral anticancer drug miltefosine, and the antimalarial drug sitamaquine, all of which were shown efficient for treating leishmaniases. Despite the success of this repurposing strategy, all these therapies have important limitations: (1) miltefosine is teratogenic, can provoke acute gastrointestinal side effects, and the length of the treatment (several weeks) causes poor treatment compliance with the risk of relapse [16], (2) conventional amphotericin B deoxycholate is not only nephrotoxic but also costly and cannot be stored at high temperature, rendering it unaffordable in some countries [17], and (3) paromomycin needs long parenteral regimens, involving qualified personnel and hospitalization [18].",

Relapse can occur, and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis can appear even months after the end of therapy [20]. These drawbacks, together with the high attrition rate observed in the leishmaniases drug discovery pipeline, caused a recent shift from the discovery of new drugs to the use of combination therapies involving 2 or more drugs at lower dosage and shorter treatment duration [21]. This is believed to overcome 2 major handicaps of current drugs, i.e., toxicity and emergence of drug-resistant parasites.",

Following this rationale, a number of potential target candidates have been identified (reviewed in [24]) and implicated in a large variety of biological functions (S1 Table). The possibility to selectively inhibit the proteasomes of the 3 pathogenic trypanosomatids, i.e., Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi, and T. brucei, without interfering with the mammalian orthologous pathway holds great promise to discover novel treatments with broad applicability on the most important neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) [25].

It is well established that Leishmania can escape drug action by modulating its gene content through various mechanisms, including gene tandem duplication, deletion, or extrachromosomal amplification, which rely on homologous recombination via interspersed repeated sequence elements [26\u201330]. In the absence of transcriptional regulation, Leishmania often resorts to chromosomal amplification as a means to modulate gene expression and to override drug pressure or adapt to a changing environment [31\u201334]. Likewise, mutation or deletion of transporter genes, such as those coding for aquaglyceroporine, the miltefosine transporter, or its accessory protein, LdRos3, have been linked to drug resistance [28, 35, 36].",

            "text": "Macrophages eliminate pathogenic microorganisms directly via nitric oxide (NO) or reactive oxygen species (ROS), or indirectly via the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that initiate antimicrobial responses. Leishmania evades and subverts these host cell functions through the use of parasite proteins and glycolipid effectors, which are either expressed on the parasite surface or released into the cytoplasm, where they target host cell signaling processes [39\u201342]. Additionally, Leishmania interferes with the antigen-presentation capacity of their host cells through multiple mechanisms, implicating changes in abundance of costimulatory molecules or Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-peptide complexes, destabilization of lipid rafts, or sequestration of Leishmania antigens [42\u201348]. Finally, Leishmania can interfere with the expression of microRNAs, which are considered as master regulators of the cellular transcriptome with important immunomodulatory functions (reviewed in [49]). In conclusion, a better understanding of how Leishmania interferes with macrophage immune functions may open important new venues to rescue the host cell\u2019s immune potential by immunotherapy or immunochemotherapy, for example, using pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines alone or in combination with antileishmanial drugs (reviewed in [50, 51]).",

It is therefore not surprising that the impact of Leishmania infection on the host cell transcriptome translates into important metabolic changes that fuel parasite intracellular growth. Indeed, various reports demonstrated the up-regulation of genes coding for key molecules involved in sterol and fatty acid metabolisms during the early phase of infection and during active multiplication of intracellular parasites [11, 12, 58]. These transcriptional studies were supported by proteomics findings demonstrating the establishment of a Leishmania-specific macrophage protein expression profile with singular features related to major metabolic pathways [59\u201361]. Together, these data confirm that Leishmania turn their host cells into metabolic factories to ensure intracellular amastigote growth. Conceivably, this metabolic dependence of the parasite on the host cell may open new venues to eliminate intracellular Leishmania, for example, by pharmacological restoration of normal macrophage metabolic functions that may cause parasite death by starvation.",

The importance of released kinases in the survival of intracellular parasites is well illustrated by members of the Toxoplasma ROP kinases family, with ROP16 phosphorylating and activating STAT3 [70, 71], thus mimicking anti-inflammatory signal transduction. Likewise, members of the Plasmodium FIK kinase protein family [72] that are exported into the erythrocyte cytoplasm shortly after infection were implicated in remodeling host cell membrane and cytoskeleton, with a likely impact on cytoadhesion [73]. In contrast, the role of Leishmania ectokinases in intracellular infection has not been studied in detail. Studies on the secretome and the exosomal proteome in L. donovani promastigotes identified over 400 putative ectoproteins [74, 75], including 13 secreted and 14 exosomal kinases, the majority of which are involved in biochemical processes (glycolytic pathways, nucleotide synthesis), suggesting an important effect on the host cell metabolism. Only 3 signaling kinases were identified, i.e., the mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3 and MPK11 and Casein kinase 1 isoform 2 (CK1.2). Only CK1.2 has been functionally linked to infection and host cell immune subversion and, thus, is further described below.",

Thus, drug-discovery efforts directed to target Leishmania-released kinases can benefit from the availability of dedicated libraries that have already been well characterized. Second, it is conceivable that inhibitors that target Leishmania-released kinases that only affect the host may be more refractory for the development of drug resistance.

Various pathogens modulate host cell DNA methylation levels to inhibit expression of genes that are involved in clearance of the infectious agent but also increase expression of genes that promote microbial growth and survival. For example, changes in DNA methylation levels were linked to (1) attenuated NFKB1- and IRF2-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [82], (2) modulation of the inflammatory response, apoptosis, and pathogen-induced signaling during Burkholderia pseudomallei infection [83], and (3) changes in host behavior as observed in Toxoplasma gondii\u2013infected mice, in which a decrease in the methylation levels of the arginine vasopressin promoter and subsequent increased neuronal gene expression were linked to fear reversion against the natural predator, promoting parasite transmission [84]. In contrast to these examples, only very limited information is available on the epigenetic impact of Leishmania infection on the host cell, with only 1 recent study showing that L. donovani causes epigenetic variation in macrophage DNA methylation, thus interfering with genes implicated in host cell antimicrobial defense [85].",

Likewise, decreased histone acetylation during T. gondii infection has been linked to altered STAT1 binding to INF\u03b3-regulated promoters, which was reversed by treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors [87]. Theileria-induced SMYD3 methyltransferase activity increases histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation in the promoter of the host cell matrix metalloproteinase 9 gene, and increased expression of this protein has been linked to the invasive phenotype of infected cells [88].",

The Leishmania genome encodes for an important number of putative histone-modifying enzymes (HMEs) [94]. In light of the largely constitutive gene expression in these early-branching eukaryotes, it is interesting to speculate that some of these proteins may be released and modify host cell histones to establish permissive conditions for intracellular survival. Alternatively, Leishmania infection may alter the activity of host cell HMEs that establishes an epigenetic profile permissive for intracellular parasite survival. Targeting parasite-released HMEs or directly modulating the host cell epigenome opens exciting new avenues for antileishmanial therapies that may be more refractory to the emergence of drug resistance. This possibility is supported by recent findings demonstrating that the antileishmanial effect of imipramine, an antidepressant, is mediated via its effect on host cell HDAC11, which decreases IL10 expression [95], thus overcoming a host cell-dependent mechanism of antimony resistance.",

Our review proposes such new strategies by (1) targeting parasite ectokinases that modulate the host cell phenotype to establish permissive conditions for parasite survival, and (2) targeting host cell histone-modifying enzymes to restore a normal macrophage transcript profile that may be deleterious for intracellular Leishmania survival (Fig 2). Systems-level approaches combining high-throughput sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics analyses, RNAi screening, and pharmacological assessment need to be conducted to establish the proof-of-principle for these strategies and discover and validate such novel targets. Drug targets that are not under the direct genetic control of the parasite may allow the discovery of inhibitors that are likely more refractory to classical mechanisms of drug resistance that often involves mutation of target gene or uptake systems, or amplification of efflux pumps.",

First, given the differences in lifestyle and pathogenicity between the 3 major trypanosomatid pathogens, with T. brucei being an obligate extracellular pathogen and T. cruzi infecting various mammalian cells, the development of a pan-kinetoplastid therapy seems difficult. This fact is further illustrated by a recent high-throughput drug-screening campaign against all 3 trypanosomatids that identified only a few compounds with broad activity [96]. Even though one may expect that this will turn down Big Pharma from host-directed therapies, quite on the contrary, this strategy may actually incite important interest, as macrophages are the host cells of various viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens with major global public health impact. It is conceivable that these pathogens have evolved intracellular survival strategies that are analogous to the ones employed by Leishmania, opening the exciting and yet unexplored possibility of pan-intracellular pathogen therapies.",
