The prototypic member, CEA (or CEACAM5), was initially discovered as a membrane-anchored tumor antigen [1]. CEACAM subfamily proteins have since been shown to play important roles in the regulation of immune responses, angiogenesis, the differentiation of mammary glands, insulin signaling turnover, tumorigenesis, and metastasis [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. By contrast, PSGs have been characterized as highly glycosylated major proteins from human syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy. High levels of human PSGs have been detected in maternal serum as early as 3 days postfertilization, coinciding with the attachment of the blastocyst to the uterine wall, and were believed to be critical for protecting the semiallotypic fetus from the maternal immune system during pregnancy in, at least, primates [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], .",

            "text": "Whereas the CEACAM/PSG genes were previously considered eutherian-specific, recent studies have shown that homologs with 30\u201350% protein sequence similarity to human CEACAMs are present in the marsupial opossum and monotreme platypus [20], [21]. Interestingly, the inventory of CEACAM/PSG genes in mammals appeared to vary greatly even among closely related species. For example, whereas mice contain 27 CEACAM/PSG homologs, rats have only 16 counterparts [20], [21]. In addition, earlier studies of nucleotide substitution and the dN/dS ratio in primates and rodents showed that select CEACAM/PSG genes underwent positive or purifying selection [22], [23]. These earlier observations suggested that the duplication/retention of CEACAM/PSG genes could be susceptible to environmental selection, and the process could be similar to the birth, fixation, and loss of adaptive genes such as olfactory receptors and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in select vertebrates [24], [25], [26]. Because the analysis of nucleotide or amino acid selection across closely related species provides only a rough estimate of genetic variation within a narrow time frame, how unique the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes in vertebrates remains to be investigated. In addition, the difficulty in analyzing CEACAM/PSG gene evolution was further aggravated by the large variation in gene repertoire among species, which violates various assumptions of statistical methods commonly used in the analysis of gene selection. Accordingly, we hypothesized that an integrative analysis that encompasses a wide time spectrum is needed to better understand the evolution of CEACAM/PSG genes. Here, based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes and the analysis of genetic variations in humans, we show that CEACAM/PSG genes represent an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and were frequently subject to selection by gene\u2013environmental interactions. Importantly, we also found that human CEACAM/PSG locus is enriched with genetic variations, and the PSG gene inventory could range from 12 to 30 copies among individuals, indicating an ongoing selection of these genes in major, geographically separated human populations. Because PSGs and CEACAMs are important for normal pregnancy and immune responses, our study thus provides a framework for further exploration of adaptive genotype\u2013phenotype relationships involving these fast-evolving genes in reproduction, pregnancy complications, and other patho-physiologies in humans.",

Initially, human and mouse CEACAM sequences were compared against the genomes and proteomes of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), bushbaby (Otolemur garnettii), mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), dog (Canis familiaris), opossum (Monodelphis domestica), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), chicken (Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagri gallopavo), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis), West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae), medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), zebrafish (Danio rerio), pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis), stickleback (Gasteroteus aculeatus), little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae), and tunicates (Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi). Unique protein sequences with E<0.0001 were analyzed with additional blast searches against the human nonredundant protein database to detect the best reciprocal hits. In this step, we excluded homologs for other proteins with IgV-like and IgC-like motifs that did not share a common root with mammalian CEACAMs. Due to sequence divergence, the relationship between newly identified homologs and human CEACAMs cannot be determined unambiguously. Based on this observation and earlier studies, we reasoned that CEACAM family genes likely underwent extensive neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization after gene duplication, and that heterotachy incurred by functional divergence led to the difficulty in phylogeny analysis [29]. Therefore, we sought to determine the phylogenetic relationship of novel CEACAM family genes with syntenic mapping.",

We inferred that a pair of duplicates in teleosts would be whole genome duplication (WGD)-derived co-orthologs if they were located on human-T. nigroviridis or human-D. rerio syntenic chromosomal regions. By contrast, CEACAM found on neighboring loci on the same chromosome were determined to have been derived from tandem duplications. Therefore, the presence of an ancestor for a select group of CEACAMs in the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of a select lineage was deduced from analyses combining BLAST results and syntenic mapping. However, we cannot exclude the possibility, albeit a low probability, that some teleost homologs found on duplicated syntenic chromosomal regions were not WGD-derived co-orthologs.",

We resorted to select representative genes from each lineage so that outlier sequences were not included in the multiple sequence alignment. We constructed representative sets of genes from three targeted clades: primate only, mammal only, and fish only. The amino-acid sequences were aligned using MUSLE v3.8 with default settings [33]. The pairwise genetic distances between amino-acid sequences was estimated using the JTT matrix-based method [34]. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. The phylogenetic trees were first constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method [35] implemented in MEGA v5.05 [36].

On the other hand, the prototherian platypus encoded only four CEACAM homologs (OanCEACAM16, 16LI, 20LI, and 20LII)(Fig. 1b; Table S2 in File S1), and a pair of these homologs are positioned in tandem (Fig. 1b, Contig 2758). While CEACAM homologs from metatherian and prototherian mammals exhibit overall sequence similarity with eutherian counterparts, they have diverged extensively in domain structure and protein length as well as gene inventory, suggesting the absence of true orthologous relationship between these homologs and those of humans. Interestingly, although phylogenetic trees built with the Neighbor-Joining method showed little confidence on the relationship of most opossum and platypus homologs with those of eutherian homologs (Fig. 2b), phylogenetic trees built with the Maximum Likelihood method suggested that mammalian CEACAMs can be separated into two major branches: CEACAM16/18/20 and those clustered with the better characterized human CEACAM1-like members (Fig. 3b; Fig. S1 in File S1). In addition, the majority of metatherian homologs clustered in a sub-branch appeared to separate from those of human CEACAM1-like members.",

The hypothesis is supported by the finding that PSG genes in apes and Rhesus monkeys could be derived from independent expansion even though Rhesus monkey ancestors diverged from those of humans only 25 million years ago. This observation led us to further hypothesize that the selection shaping CEACAM/PSG gene repertoire in apes could be ongoing, and human CEACAM/PSG genes, as a group, could continue to diverge at a pace greater than that of other genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the extent of genetic variations (i.e., CNVs and SNPs) in human CEACAM/PSG genes, and whether the occurrence of CNVs and SNPs differs among human populations. In these analyses, richness and diversity of structural and nucleotide variations were used as proxies to determine the tendency for selection.",

Three of these CNVs actually represented the longest gains or losses of chromosome segment on chromosome 19, and all these CNVs affected multiple PSG genes: CNVR3824.1 (379 kb, encompassing PSG1, 2, 6, 7, 10, and 11), CNVR7658.2 (238 kb, including PSG1, 6, 7, 10, and 11), and CNVR7658.5 (252 kb, including PSG2, 4, 5, and 9)(Table S5 in File S1). Among CNVs, those have a frequency higher than 1% are distinguished as copy number polymorphisms. Based on this criterion, almost all CEACAM/PSG CNVs represented common copy number polymorphisms (>3% frequency) that have been retained in recent human history. Furthermore, we estimated that the copy number of PSG genes could range from 12 copies in individuals who are homozygous for gene loss at CNVR7658.2 to 30 copies in individuals with homozygous gene gains at CNVR7658.5, instead of 22 copies found in most individuals.",

First, we compared the density of synonymous and nonsynonymous gene-region SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes to those of other genes on chromosome 19. Although the density of synonymous SNPs within CEACAM/PSG genes was similar to the average of other genes, the density of nonsynonymous SNPs in CEACAM/PSG genes was significantly higher than that of the rest of genes on chromosome 19 (Table 1, p<0.01).

In support of our hypothesis, we found that only 3.2% (N = 43) and 2.6% (N = 34) of a total of 1327 non-CEACAM/PSG genes contained at least one coding SNP with FST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket of all SNPs, respectively. On the other hand, seven and three out of 25 CEACAM/PSG genes (28% and 12%) had at least one coding SNP with FST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket, respectively. In addition, we found that eight out of these 25 genes contained gene region SNPs with FST scores in the top 5% bracket (Table S6 in File S1). In addition to CEACAM/PSG genes, chromosome 19 encodes several gene families that exhibit functional and evolutional characteristics similar to CEACAM/PSGs. These progressive gene families includes sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin, leukocyte immunoglobulinlike receptor, and olfactory receptor gene families [29], [31], [42], [43], [54], [55]. They encode secreted ligands or cell surface receptors, and the family size expanded multiple times during the evolution of primates. Interestingly, 25% and 19.4% of genes in these three families contained at least one nonsynonymous SNP with FST scores in the top 15% and 10% bracket, respectively (Table 3). Therefore, the ratio of genes containing coding SNP(s) with a high FST score in CEACAM/PSG and these three progressive gene families is categorically higher than other genes (conserved genes) on chromosome 19 (Fig. 6, Table 3).",

However, due to the extensive divergence in CEACAM/PSG sequences, it has been difficult to extrapolate animal studies to humans and vice versa, thereby limiting our understanding of the molecular and biochemical nature of CEACAM/PSG signaling. Here, syntenic mapping has clarified the relationship of various CEACAM-like genes identified in noneutherian mammals and basal taxonomy. In addition, our analysis implied that the characteristic CEACAM-signaling pathway that involves the recruitment of downstream molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP1 phosphatase, and RAC-GTPase by ITAM or ITIM motifs could have evolved in the MRCA of teleosts and tetrapods, but not in urocordates, cephalochordates or sea lamprey [7], [61]. Furthermore, our analysis indicated that CEACAM/PSG gene family represents an independent branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Earlier analyses of adaptive immunity have shown that jawed and jawless vertebrates developed antigen receptors independently, and the hallmark of adaptive immunity of vertebrates, including major histocompatibility complex molecules and T/B-cell receptors originated in jawed vertebrates [42], [54]. Thus, the immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-containing CEACAM family genes have evolved in parallel with BCRs, TCRs, and FcR\u03b3 receptors in jawed vertebrates.",

On the longest timescales, selection is evidenced by differences in gene inventory and gene functions. At shorter timescales, selection is indicated by an excess of nonsynonymous changes as compared to synonymous substitutions. At time scales <80 thousand years, positively selected SNPs in humans could be detected by an excess of derived alleles in LD because there is no sufficient time for the genetic diversity to be restored by mutation and drift [56], [62]. However, none of these studies alone could provide a comprehensive view of how divergent the evolution of a gene family was. This is particularly true for gene families that contain redundant members. In addition, varied arrangements of functional domains among paralogs, such as those found in CEACAM/PSG genes, could add to the challenge of analysis of gene evolution [56], [62]. In the present study, we broadened the study of CEACAM/PSG gene evolution in two directions: the identification of CEACAM homologs in basal taxonomy (long timescale) and the investigation of genetic diversity in humans during a short timescale (i.e., after the Out-of-Africa human migration). On the first front, we found that CEACAM genes evolved in a radical manner in various lineages. In an extreme instance, these genes were completely lost (i.e., avian species). On the second front, we took two complementary approaches\u2013 local variations in density of coding SNPs/CNVs and population-based assessment of genetic variations\u2013to assess the extent of divergence. In these analyses, genes on chromosome 19, rather than the genome-wide samples, were selected to account for local substitution rate variation. In these analyses, we found CEACAM/PSG genes contain high density of nonsynonymous SNPs and CNVs, and many of these genetic variations exhibit high population differentiation, indicating extensive gene\u2013environmental interactions at the CEACAM/PSG locus. In addition, these data suggested that the selection force shaping the expanded CEACAM/PSG gene inventory in Old World primates is ongoing in humans. Whereas the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated, the evolutionary course of these genes could be a result of combinations of factors.",

Recent studies have revealed that an estimated 5\u201310% of the vertebrate gene repertoire consist of \u2015progressive (vs. conserved) gene families which mainly function in immunity, reproduction, and chemosensory [25], [63], [64], [65], and that ligands and cell surface receptors could be preferentially retained after gene duplications, perhaps due to low constraints imposed by fewer interacting protein partners compared to intracellular polypeptides that form complexes with many partners in two-way communication [66], [67]. Because CEACAMs and PSGs mainly function as cell surface receptor or secreted ligand, their evolution could be similar to that of a variety of progressive genes, including olfactory receptors, male gamete-associated reproductive genes, KIRs, and other immune-associated gene families, which experienced frequent birth-and-death of duplicated genes in response to environmental pressures.",

            "text": "Second, the frequent occurrence of CNVs at the PSG locus could be partly attributed to the presence of repetitive sequences. It is well accepted that frequent gene gain and gene loss in progressive genes could be the result of unequal crossover of genes with repeated domains, which can promote rearrangements through their own repeatability [68], [69]. Similarly, recent studies have shown that CNV mutation rates in duplication-rich regions could be significantly higher than SNPs due to their propensity to undergo nonallelic homologous recombination, thereby making CNV to be recurrent at specific loci [70]. Physiologically, the redundancy of CEACAM/PSG genes could be selected for the provision of a robustness against null phenotypes in individuals [71], [72]. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that transgenic mice deficient for Ceacam1, 9, or 10 exhibit minimal or no aberrant phenotypes [3], [73], [74]. In addition, the enhanced redundancy could, theoretically, further reduce the constraint and add new opportunities for genetic drift or selection to operate on new alleles, thereby allowing the accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs in duplicated PSG genes. However, it is important to note that the presence of repeated sequences alone could not account for the selection of high genetic variations at the CEACAM/PSG locus. Recent studies of CNV hotspots in humans have identified several duplication-rich regions on chromosome 19, which contain clusters of zinc finger proteins (ZNFs, with a total of 204 members on chromosome 19) [75]. However, these ZNF cluster loci did not exhibit appreciable increases of genetic variations as compared to other genes on chromosome 19. For example, the ratio of ZNF family genes that have a high FST nonsynonymous SNP (5.4%) is similar to that of other genes on the same chromosome (3.2%).",

Recent analyses of SNPs showed that human genomes contain hundreds of loci that exhibit signatures of positive selection (i.e., gene\u2013environmental interactions) [56], [76], and a number of these genetic variants are associated with the evolution of a variety of common traits (e.g., appearance, physiological adaptations) and pathologies in humans [76], [77], [78], [79]. Likewise, CNVs have been associated with a number of human phenotypes and diseases [80], [81]. For example, amylase CNVs were highly associated starch contents of the food among human populations [82], whereas, CNVs at the CCL3L-CCL4L locus were associated with the susceptibility to auto-immune disorders, HIV-1 infection, and asthma [83], [84], [85]. While PSG physiology could be dosage insensitive (PSG copy number could range from 12 to 30 in normal individuals), the observation that CEACAM/PSG variations are comparable to those of genes under rapid adaptive evolution in primates [86], [87] suggested that CEACAM/PSG variation-associated changes in functional characteristics or gene expression could help determine survival and reproductive success of the carrier.",

Given that CEACAM/PSGs could act through homophilic and heterophilic interactions [7], [9], the pressure to select new variants could be self-enforced if the carrier of a new immuno-modulation CEACAM/PSG variant favors fetus with the new variant as a result of immunocompatibility. By the same token, this mechanism could also contribute to the high population differentiation of select CEACAM/PSG variants. Therefore, our finding could represent an important vehicle for exploring novel genotype\u2013phenotype relationships in PSG-mediated fetal\u2013maternal interactions. In addition, our study raised the possibility that genetic variations at the PSG locus could be involved in the manifestation of reduced fertility and various pregnancy complications in select individuals.

On the other hand, the platypus genome encoded four CEACAM homologs (OanCEACAM16, 16LI, 20LI, and 20LII)(Table S2 in File S1). In X. tropicalis, three homologs (XtrCEACAMI-III) were located near marker genes, including LIPE, CNFN, TMEM145, PAFAH1B3, and ZNF574.

Human, Hsa; Chimpanzee, Ptr; Rhesus monkey, Mmu. b) Phylogenetic tree of 48 CEACAM family proteins from human, dog (C. familiaris), opossum (M. domestica), and platypus (O. anatinus). The analysis involved 48 protein sequences. There were a total of 2119 positions in the final dataset. The human CEACAM1-like cluster is indicated by a vertical bar on the right. The CEACAM16 and 20 homologs appear to diverge from other family members before the separation of eutherian, metatherian and prototherian mammals. Human, Hsa; dog, Cfa, opossum, Mdo; platypus, Oan. It is important to note that the bootstrap values for basal lineages in this tree are extremely low. The interpretation of this Neighbor-Joining tree has to be cautious. c) Phylogenetic tree of teleost CEACAM homologs. Twenty-three CEACAM proteins from D. rerio, G. aculeatus, T. rubripes, and T. nigroviridis were analyzed. A D. rerio-specific cluster is indicated by a vertical bar on the right. The robustness of the tree was assessed by 1,000 bootstrap replicates, and the percentage of replicates is shown next to the branches.",
