ZIKV was originally isolated in a rhesus macaque in 1947 [2], but this virus has only recently claimed worldwide attention owing to its close association with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), as represented by microcephaly, fetal demise, central nervous system abnormalities, and other neurological complications [3,4,5,6,7]. No antiviral therapeutics for the treatment of ZIKV-associated human diseases, particularly congenital syndrome and fetal death, have been approved. This calls for the development of safe and effective therapeutic agents against ZIKV infection in humans.",

The life cycle of ZIKV involves several crucial steps, including viral attachment to target cell receptors or cofactors, receptor-mediated endocytosis (viral entry), virus\u2013endosomal membrane fusion, and postentry or post-translation stages [9,10]. In this life cycle, E protein plays a key role in viral entry into target cells and subsequent fusion of virus and cell membranes; thus, ZIKV E protein serves as an important therapeutic target against ZIKV infection [11,12].",

Gossypol-treated ZIKV was then incubated with Vero E6 cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.

Specifically, the following six stages of ZIKV infection were tested: (a) pretreatment of ZIKV (PAN2016, ~2.5 \u00d7 103 PFU; MOI ~0.025) with natural products at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h before incubation with cells; (b) pretreatment of cells with natural products at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h before incubation with ZIKV (PAN2016, ~100 PFU; MOI ~0.001); (c) cotreatment of cells with ZIKV (PAN2016, ~300 PFU; MOI ~0.003) and natural products at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h; (d) cotreatment of cells, ZIKV (PAN2016, ~100 PFU; MOI ~0.001), and natural products at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h; (e) preincubation of cells with ZIKV (PAN2016, ~300 PFU; MOI ~0.003) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h and then incubation with natural products at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h; and (f) preincubation of ZIKV (PAN2016, ~100 PFU; MOI ~0.001) and cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by incubation with natural products at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.",

These natural products were subsequently ordered from Sigma with \u2265 95% purity, and tested for their cytotoxicity using a cell-based cytotoxicity assay (CCK8 kit), with CC50 values ranging from 14.17 to 323.71 \u00b5M (Table 2, Figure S1). Among these natural products, curcumin has been previously reported to inhibit ZIKV infection [37], whereas the other three natural products have not been previously reported to have anti-ZIKV activity.

The results showed that these natural products could inhibit infections of all nine ZIKV strains tested with various IC50 values (Table 2). Gossypol exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity for IC50 values, ranging from 0.21 to 4.31 \u00b5M, against all nine ZIKV strains tested (Table 2). It was also more potent than bortezomib, the anti-ZIKV previously reported compound as an active compound control, against all ZIKV strains tested (Table 2). The IC90 values of these natural products against the selected ZIKV strain, PRVABC59, were calculated, among which gossypol had the lowest IC90 value (about 8.81 \u00b5M, slightly higher than its IC50 value but lower than its CC50 value) (Figure S2), confirming its strong and broad-spectrum anti-ZIKV activity.",

To test whether a natural product can neutralize ZIKV infection or inhibit viral entry by targeting the viral proteins, ZIKV was pretreated with the natural product at 37 \u00b0C before incubation with the host cells (Figure 3A(a)). To evaluate whether a natural product can bind to the cellular receptors or cofactors to block virus\u2013receptor binding, cells were pretreated with the natural product at 37 \u00b0C before incubation with ZIKV (Figure 3A(b)). To determine whether a natural product can inhibit attachment of ZIKV to target cells, but cannot block the virus\u2013cell membrane fusion, cells were cotreated with ZIKV at 4 \u00b0C in the presence of the natural product (Figure 3A(c)).

            "text": "After completing the above approaches, we gained insight into the potential mechanisms of the natural products responsible for inhibiting ZIKV (PAN2016) infection. After pretreatment of ZIKV with gossypol at 37 \u00b0C before incubation with the target cells, ZIKV completely lost its infectivity, whereas it maintained its infectivity after other treatments described above (Figure 3B), suggesting that gossypol can effectively neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the virus, rather than the cell or cell-associated entry or replication stages. The results from curcumin revealed that about 75\u2013100% of ZIKV infection was blocked when curcumin was incubated with ZIKV only at 37 \u00b0C, or coincubated with ZIKV and cells at 4 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C, whereas there was low to no impact on ZIKV infection when curcumin was pretreated with cells or postincubated with ZIKV-treated cells at 4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C, respectively (Figure 3C). These results suggest that curcumin inhibits ZIKV infection at the early stages of viral entry, particularly the viral attachment stage. Pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with digitonin and then with ZIKV or cotreatment of cells with ZIKV and digitonin at 37 \u00b0C significantly (\u226594%) blocked ZIKV infection, whereas preincubation of cells with ZIKV and then with digitonin at 37 \u00b0C, pretreatment of cells with ZIKV at 4 \u00b0C and then with digitonin at 37 \u00b0C, or cotreatment of cells with digitonin and ZIKV at 4 \u00b0C inhibited about 49\u201374% of ZIKV infection (Figure 3D). In contrast, preincubation of digitonin and ZIKV had no effect on ZIKV infection (Figure 3D). These results suggest that digitonin could not directly neutralize ZIKV infection, but inhibited ZIKV infection by binding to the viral receptors or inhibiting viral entry (i.e., attachment and membrane fusion or postentry steps). The data from conessine indicated that coincubation of cells with conessine and ZIKV at 37 \u00b0C or postincubation of conessine with ZIKV-treated cells at 4 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C resulted in 80\u201396% inhibition of ZIKV infection, whereas pretreatment of cells with conessine before ZIKV incubation blocked about 38% of ZIKV infection. Nevertheless, preincubation of conessine and ZIKV at 37 \u00b0C or cotreatment of cells with conessine and ZIKV at 4 \u00b0C had very low to no effect on ZIKV infection (Figure 3E). These data suggest that conessine does not block ZIKV attachment to the host cell, but inhibits ZIKV infection by targeting virus\u2013cell fusion or postentry step. The above steps of inhibition of ZIKV infection were further proven by the respective anti-ZIKV compound controls (Figure 3F\u2013I). Therefore, the above data confirm the potent inhibitory activity of the identified natural products, particularly gossypol, in blocking ZIKV infection at various stages of the viral life cycle.",

In the meantime, there was no binding between the control mAb ZKA78 and EDIII protein, so no obvious inhibition of gossypol was detected (Figure 4D). The above ZIKV EDIII-specific mAbs have been previously shown to potently neutralize ZIKV infection [17] and recognize epitopes, including the lateral ridge, such as residues 309\u2013314, 331\u2013337, 368, 370, 371, and 393\u2013397 of ZIKV EDIII protein [39,40,41].

Results demonstrated significant combinatorial inhibitory effects against three ZIKV strains (PAN2016, FLR, and PRVABC59) tested when combining gossypol with any of these natural products, and the CI values ranged from 0.44 to 0.6 \u00b5M, 0.44 to 0.95 \u00b5M, and 0.19 to 0.3 \u00b5M for ZIKV PAN2016, FLR, and PRVABC59 strains, respectively (Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5). The combinations of gossypol with each of these natural products also resulted in the highest enhancement of anti-PRVABC59 activity among the three ZIKV strains tested (Table 5). These data show that gossypol can be combined with other inhibitors described above to further increase overall inhibitory activity against current and future emergent ZIKV strains.",

Therefore, we also assessed the change of CC50 of the natural products alone and in combination, and compared the enhancement of CC50 with that of IC50 against ZIKV strain PRVABC59. As shown in Table 6, the cytotoxicity of gossypol in combination with curcumin, digitonin, or conessine was not enhanced. The cytotoxicity of gossypol in combination with bortezomib was slightly increased (1.35-fold), but it was much lower than the enhancement in anti-PRVABC59 activity of gossypol (8.73-fold) in combination with bortezomib. In addition, the cytotoxicity of curcumin and bortezomib, respectively, in combination with gossypol was not enhanced. The cytotoxicity of digitonin or conessine in combination with gossypol was slightly increased by about 2.60- and 5.78-fold, respectively, while they were still lower than the enhancement in anti-PRVABC59 activity of digitonin (5.98-fold) or conessine (6.29-fold) in combination with gossypol. Moreover, the CI values of gossypol with any of the four natural products tested were greater than 1 (Table 6), indicating that there was no combinatorial effect on the cytotoxicity to the test cells. These results suggest that the observed decrease in the IC50 values of the natural products in combination was not due to the enhancement in cytotoxicity of these natural products.",

            "text": "Development of safe and effective antiviral therapeutics is urgently needed to treat ZIKV infections and ZIKV-caused diseases, particularly ZIKV-associated microcephaly, fetal death, or neurological diseases [7,42,43,44,45]. Here, we have identified four small-molecule-based natural products, namely gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine, with robust anti-ZIKV activities in Vero E6 cells. Among them, gossypol had the greatest potency to block infections of ZIKV for almost all 10 strains isolated from 1947 to 2016 from nine countries and three hosts, including six recent human strains associated with congenital Zika syndrome and other neurological malformations. Time-of-addition-based mechanistic studies indicated that gossypol could neutralize ZIKV infection by targeting the virus rather than the cell or cell-associated ZIKV entry or replication steps. Inhibition assays revealed that gossypol strongly bound to ZIKV E protein, particularly the conserved EDIII, and blocked the binding between ZIKV EDIII and EDIII-specific neutralizing mAbs, rationalizing its efficacious and broad-spectrum anti-ZIKV activity. It appears that the binding between gossypol and ZIKV E/EDIII protein might be nonspecific, since gossypol is also active against other enveloped viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, influenza virus, and HIV-1 [46,47,48,49,50]. Because of the potential toxicity and side effects of gossypol to humans [50,51,52], it might not be a good idea to use this natural product as a drug to treat human diseases, including ZIKV-associated microcephaly and other flavivirus-caused diseases. Nevertheless, the goal of this study is to identify the best active, natural product, then modify it to improve its antiviral activity and drug-like properties and reduce its toxicity. Due to the symmetric nature of the gossypol molecule, there will be better opportunity to defragment its structure to smaller drug-like molecules with higher activity and lower toxicity. Therefore, it is suggested not to use gossypol as the lead molecule, but rather the final drug. Unlike gossypol, digitonin and conessine did not neutralize ZIKV directly, but instead inhibited ZIKV infection at various stages of the life cycle, including viral attachment, membrane fusion, or postentry steps. Notably, digitonin is a glycoalkaloid saponin detergent. It is widely used as a cell membrane permeabilizing agent [53,54] and a detergent for selective solubilization of membrane proteins [55,56,57]; thus, the antiviral activity of this natural product is likely to be very nonspecific. By comparison, conessine appears to be a good candidate with a decent anti-ZIKV activity and very low cytotoxicity (higher selectivity). However, it is a steroidal alkaloid [58], which might not be ideal for further optimization. Similar to gossypol, curcumin may directly neutralize ZIKV infection, but it seems to mainly inhibit the early stage (attachment) of virus infection, the mechanism of which is similar to that seen in a previous report using different approaches [37].",

Also, such combinations enhanced the individual antiviral activity of curcumin, digitonin, and conessine against the test viruses.

            "text": "Overall, this study has evaluated the antiviral activity of four natural products in vitro, among which three are newly identified natural products with strong anti-ZIKV ability. Future observations will be needed to evaluate the protective efficacy of these natural products individually or in combination, or using their defragmented, small drug-like molecules (in the case of gossypol) against ZIKV-caused congenital infection and fetal demise in available animal models. Modification of the structure of gossypol and identification of its derivatives with better antiviral activity, but without cytotoxicity, would be essential for developing a safe and effective anti-ZIKV agent for human use. Also, future studies to evaluate the antiviral activity of modified gossypol or its derivatives against other flaviviruses, both in vitro and in vivo, will be helpful for identification of an effective and safe pan-flavivirus inhibitor. Taken together, the broad-spectrum ability of the identified natural products, especially gossypol, against ZIKV and DENV infections indicates the potential for further development of these small molecules or their derivatives as the lead compounds or effective anti-flavivirus inhibitors.",

(A) The time-of-addition experiment was performed in Vero E6 cells, and specific procedures are illustrated in detail in (a\u2013f). (a) Pretreatment of ZIKV: ZIKV was incubated with one of the natural products (NPs; including gossypol, curcumin, digitonin, and conessine) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After removal of the unbound NPs, the NP-treated ZIKV was incubated with cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by culture of the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 4\u20135 days before calculation of plaques. (b) Pretreatment of cells: cells were preincubated with one of the NPs at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, and the unbound NPs were then removed, followed by addition of ZIKV and incubation of cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. After removal of the unbound ZIKV, the cells were cultured and plaques were calculated as in (a). (c) Blockage of ZIKV attachment: cells were incubated with ZIKV at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow ZIKV attachment, but not fusion between ZIKV and cell membranes, in the presence of one of the NPs. After removal of the unbound ZIKV and NPs, the cells were cultured and plaques were calculated as in (a). (d) Cotreatment of ZIKV and cells: cells were infected with ZIKV at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of one of the NPs, followed by removal of the unbound viruses and NPs, and culture of the cells to calculate plaques, as in (a). (e) Blockage of ZIKV penetration (membrane fusion): cells were incubated with ZIKV at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow ZIKV attachment. After removal of the unbound ZIKV, the cells were incubated with one of the NPs at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow fusion of virus\u2013cell membranes. After further removal of the unbound NPs, the cells were cultured and plaques were calculated as in (a). (f) Inhibition of postentry stage: cells were incubated with ZIKV at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow ZIKV entry into the target cells. After removal of the unbound ZIKV, the cells were further incubated with one of the NPs at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h, followed by removal of the unbound NPs and culture of cells for calculation of plaques, as in (a). Inhibition of natural products, including gossypol (B), curcumin (C), digitonin (D), and conessine (E), against ZIKV (PAN2016) infection in the six steps mentioned above. (F) A potent anti-ZIKV inhibitor, temoporfin [28], was used as a control for step a. (G) An anti-ZIKV entry (especially in inhibition of the internalization/fusion step) inhibitor, 25-hydroxycholesterol [29], was used as a control for steps b and e. Anti-ZIKV compound bortezomib was used as a control for step d (H), and a replication inhibitor, NITD008 [30], for step f (I). The natural product curcumin (C), which has been previously reported to inhibit the attachment of ZIKV to host cells [37], was used as a control for stage c. The percent inhibition was calculated in the presence or absence of serially diluted natural products. The data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. (n = 2). The experiments were performed in Vero E6 cells and repeated three times, with similar results.",

(D) The ability of gossypol to inhibit the binding between ZIKV EDIII and EDIII-specific neutralizing mAbs. The concentrations of ZIKV EDIII and mAbs were 1.5 and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The percent inhibition in the EDIII-mAb binding was measured in the presence or absence of serially diluted gossypol using the formula ((1-(EDIII-mAb-gossypol)/(EDIII-mAb) \u00d7 100), which, in turn, formed the basis for calculating 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values. ZIKV EDI/DII-specific mAb (ZKA78) and DMSO were used as controls. The data are expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. (n = 4). The experiments were repeated twice, with similar results.",
