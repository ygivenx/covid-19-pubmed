There are two types of TS mutants, heat-sensitive and cold-sensitive, depending on whether the permissive temperature is lower or higher than the restrictive temperature. TS mutants offer a powerful tool for in vivo investigation of gene function. A simple temperature shift can control gene activity and be executed in any cell type. Thus, TS mutants have been used to investigate gene function in many organisms, including viruses, bacteria, yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, and mammalian cell cultures [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In fact, genetic analyses of yeast essential genes have been conducted primarily with TS mutants [7].",

The standard procedure to derive TS mutants, random mutagenesis followed by genetic screen, is time-consuming and unfeasible in multicellular organisms [8], [9]. Further, only 4\u20136% of all possible single amino acid substitutions in a protein are estimated to give rise to a TS mutant [10], [11], [12]. The molecular mechanisms underlying TS mutants are poorly understood. A previous crystallography study on bacteriophage T4 lysozyme suggests that TS mutations have little effect on protein structure, tend to occur at sites with low thermal factors and low solvent accessibility, and exhibit no simple pattern of amino acid substitution [13]. Mutagenesis and computational studies suggest that TS mutations can occur on buried sites or ligand-binding sites [14], [15].",

However, only one study has focused on TS mutations [28]. TS mutants are very interesting because they can shift between stabilizing and destabilizing states. They are stabilizing mutations at permissive temperatures but deleterious mutations at restrictive temperatures. In this study, we applied a machine learning method, logistic regression, to investigate a large number of sequence and structure features, with the goal to elucidate the molecular basis of TS mutations. Our results indicate that neighborhood properties are important determinants of TS mutations. Assembling features also allowed us to predict single amino acid substitutions most likely to confer a TS mutation. In this way, TS mutants can be easily generated through targeted mutagenesis. This mutational engineering strategy is in principle applicable to model systems from bacteria to mammalian cell cultures, and will greatly enhance our capabilities to characterize gene functions.",

The crystal structures of all five proteins have been solved. For each protein, we selected a Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure [31] that had either been reported in the mutagenesis study or had the best resolution. Having access to the structure allowed us to develop and test many structure-based features. With the exception of the TBP study, which only screened for TS mutants, each of these mutagenesis studies generated both TS and neutral mutants. Neutral mutants, unlike TS, behave the same at both permissive and restrictive temperatures. Our final dataset contained 6231 single mutants, of which 747 were TS mutants and 5484 were neutral mutants. Only mutations located within the crystallized region were included.

The Delaunay tessellation divides the space spanned by a set of points into a collection of non-intersecting tetrahedra in three dimensions (3-D) (triangles in 2-D) [45], [46]. Consequently, Delaunay tetrahedra (DT) define clusters of four nearest neighbours. These clusters are not based on the use of an absolute distance cutoff, and hence are considered a more robust definition of nearest neighbours. Delaunay partitioning of 3-D space has been applied previously to proteins for modelling various aspects of structure and function, including fold recognition [47], mutation effects [48], and blind docking [49]. Our topological neighborhood includes residues that form a Delaunay tetrahedron together with the mutated residue, and are located within a sphere of certain radius centered on the mutated residue (Figure 1). We used the coordinates of C\u03b1 atoms when calculating distances. We counted all residues as well as residues by type in the topological neighborhood. A unique feature set in this category consists of the number and the type of Delaunay tetrahedra. There are five DT types based on the overlap between backbone and DT edges [47] (Figure S1).

The Kullback-Leibler divergence was calculated as , where i is TS or neutral, P(i) is the predicted probability of i, and Q(i) is the observed probability of i. In addition, two measures were calculated by taking multiple thresholds to define TS and neutral mutations: distribution distance (DD) and area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The measure DD determines how the predicted TS probability distribution differs from the predicted neutral probability distribution. The formula for DD is the same as that of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, but with the notations modified as follows. The range of the posterior probability (dependent variable) was divided into ten equal intervals. With i representing one such interval, P(i) is the probability of TS mutants in interval i, and Q(i) is the probability of neutral mutants in the same interval. A DD value of zero indicates that the predicted neutral and TS distributions are indistinguishable, while large values of DD indicate increased separation between the two distributions.",

For both Euclidean and topological neighborhood, we varied the radius of the sphere from 6 \u00c5 to 15 \u00c5 (Figure 2). We found that the AUC value reached a plateau at 11 residues for the sequence neighborhood. Thus, we included 11 residues upstream and 11 residues downstream of the mutation site as the sequence neighborhood. The AUC value for the Euclidean neighborhood gradually increased with the radius and then reached a plateau at 13 \u00c5. In contrast, the AUC value of the topological neighborhood stayed close to a constant in the radius range of 7\u201315 \u00c5. This observation is consistent with the definition of Delaunay tetrahedra, which robustly cluster four nearest neighbours together. We chose to use the same cutoff value (13 \u00c5) for the topological and Euclidean neighborhood so that the results are comparable. When comparing the performance of 20-D vectors of the three neighborhoods, we observed that the two structural neighborhoods were more predictive of TS mutations than the linear sequence neighborhood (Figure 2).

To this end, the identification of predictive features for TS mutations will enhance our understanding of TS mechanism and help engineer TS mutants for gene functional study. To assess the feature importance in predicting TS mutations, we built 133 individual feature-based classifiers and then performed a ten-fold cross-validation on each classifier. Values of ACC, MCC, KL, DD, and AUC were calculated from cross-validations to rank the 133 features (Table S2, Table S3). The top-20 predictive features for TS mutations are listed in Table 3. We found that neighborhood features dominate the top-ten list, suggesting that neighborhood properties are more predictive than mutation site properties in determining TS mutations. The most predictive feature was the 20-D vector of residue counts by type in the Euclidean neighborhood (AUC = 0.79). The similar 20-D vectors of the topological and sequence neighborhood were highly predictive as well, ranking as the 3rd (AUC = 0.75) and 11th (AUC = 0.72) most predictive features, respectively. The 20-D vector feature performed much better than the total residue counts in the Euclidean neighborhood (AUC = 0.79 versus 0.66) as well as in the topological neighborhood (AUC = 0.75 versus 0.63) (Table S2). This indicates that residue counts by type are more informative for TS mutations than a single count of total residues in the neighborhood.",

This procedure eliminates redundant as well as non-informative features from the initial set so that only a parsimonious set of the most informative features are included in the logistic regression model.

It developed a similar number of structure and sequence features as ours (108 features), most of which are Rosetta relax-derived features. Further, it only considered mutations on buried residues while our method ranks mutations on all residues. To objectively compare the performance of our method with the existing one, we tested them on the independent mutation data of HIV-1 protease. However, only six out of 124 mutations were predicted to have confidence score using the existing method; the rest are either not on buried residues or have no confidence score. Performance comparison based on these six mutations (3 TS and 3 neutral) is shown in Figure 8. The result indicates that our \u201call features\u201d model either outperforms the existing method or achieves similar performance as the existing one.",

Same training data and same feature set were used for SVM as those for the \u201call features\u201d model. The SVM classifier was trained and built with Matlab interface for the Libsvm package [57]. Different kernel functions were tested, including linear, polynomial, and radial basis function. The best combination of parameters was selected by a grid-search. Based on a ten-fold cross-validation, we obtained the best-performed SVM classifier with polynomial kernel using degree of 3, SVM parameter \u03b3 of 0.004, and penalty parameter C of 0.00011. The AUC of this SVM classifier was 0.91, which is same as that of the \u201call features\u201d model; both classifiers were evaluated via the identical cross validation procedure. This result demonstrates that our logistic regression models have similar performance as the SVM classifier.",

To compare the five measures, we computed the Pearson correlation and mutual information between every pair of the five measures across all 133 individual feature-based classifiers (Table 4). Pearson correlation is only sensitive to a linear relationship between two variables while mutual information is capable of detecting non-linear relationships. We found that AUC and DD had the best concordance according to mutual information and the third best concordance according to the Pearson correlation. Both measures consider average classification performance by taking multiple thresholds to define TS and neutral mutations.

As such, we tested sequence and structure features individually first, and then built eight different TS prediction models. We assembled 133 features to describe property changes occurring at mutation sites and in mutation site neighborhoods. Three neighborhoods were defined based on sequence, Euclidean, and topological distances. Our results highlight the importance of neighborhood features in predicting TS mutations. The top-predictive features suggest that TS mutations tend to occur at buried and rigid regions and tend to locate at conserved domains. This perfectly explains the importance of neighborhood features. Buried residues and the environment of buried residues contribute greatly to protein stability. Thus, TS mutations represent temperature-induced changes in protein stability. The change in protein stability leads to reversible functional changes.",

Many features that were top-ranked individually, such as the residue counts by type in the neighborhood, were selected by the Lasso procedure for TS prediction models. Ideally, the \u201call features\u201d model would be used to predict TS mutations. However, when protein structural information is absent, we could use the \u201csequence features\u201d model for broader application. Both \u201call features\u201d and \u201csequence features\u201d models predicted TS mutations with a 50% precision through test on independent datasets. This is a dramatic enrichment as compared to 4-6% TS mutations out of all possible single amino acid substitutions [10], [11], [12].
