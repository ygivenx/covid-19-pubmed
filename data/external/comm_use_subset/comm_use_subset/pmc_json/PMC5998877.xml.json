Its genome is a positive polarity, single stranded RNA of approximately 11 kb composed of three parts: the unique coding sequence (CDS) that produces 10 mature viral proteins via a single precursor polyprotein, and two flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) that contain important structural and functional elements [15\u201317]. Since dengue is an important human pathogen, widely recognized as a major public health concern [18], new insights into its biological and evolutionary properties including its wildtype and synthetically generated strains may have significant influence on the development of new antiviral vaccines and therapies. The Zika virus (ZIKV), also of the flavivirus genus, is closely related to DENV and was recently classified as a public health emergency of international concern due to recent outbreaks [19, 20]. The DENV and ZIKV genomes encode three structural proteins (capsid, precursor membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [21, 22].",

The resulting sequence was used as a master sequence to generate synthetic variants. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the reported results two different approaches were examined: (1) in-cellulo construction of subgenomic infectious amplicons (Fig. 1 III), and (2) PCR assembly of full-length infectious DNA (Fig. 1 IV). After three passages of the wildtype and synthetic DENV-2 viruses in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1 V), viral RNA was extracted and next generation sequencing was performed (NGS; Fig. 1 VI). The resulting sequences were verified and analysis of genomic variants was performed, with respect to single nucleotide variations (SNV) and inserts (Variants Calling; Fig. 1 VII). The results were compared to a population sample of 2004 available DENV-1/2/3/4 and ZIKV genomes (see details in Methods; Fig. 1 VIII-IV) with respect to several genomic features: nucleotide variability, secondary structure, codon and codon pair bias, CpG and GC contents. In addition, the wildtype and synthetic viruses (generated by the assembly method) were compared in vivo in the AG129 mouse model (Fig. 1 X); the comparison included: weight change, survival rates, RNA levels, and neutralizing antibodies (Ab). In the following subsections we describe the results of our analyses.",

As expected, the majority of the variations were found to be synonymous (72%). SNVs at positions 3708 and 5061 are substitutions (VAF = 1), the others (VAF < 1) may indicate polymorphisms within the population (panels \u201cSNVs\u201d and \u201cVAF\u201d). These polymorphisms may be related either to errors in viral replication [23] or to sequencing errors (for very low VAF), and may play a role in improving the fitness of the WT virus [23\u201325]. Seven significant SNVs (VAF \u2265 15% that also passed PB and SB filters) were marked by red asterisks. Further, the positions of the CDS SNVs were compared to the population sample consisting of 618 available DENV-2 genomes (see Methods for additional details). In particular relations to regions with significantly strong / weak RNA structures ([16] and Methods) and to position-wise nucleotide variability (\u201cvariability\u201d panel) were analyzed. Specifically: 14 out of 32 (44%) of SNVs in CDS were found to overlap with regions that undergo a conserved selection for strong or weak mRNA folding, although this overlap is not statistically significant with respect to random (p-value = 0.14, see Methods); this result suggests that only some of the SNVs are related to secondary structures and may influence the viral fitness via the effect on the RNA folding. Moreover, no accord between the SNVs and the nucleotide variability at the corresponding positions in the alignment of the population sample (quantified by normalized entropy, see Methods) was found (i.e. SNV\u2019s do not tend to appear in more or less conserved positions). Also, Spearman correlation between variant frequencies derived from the NGS data and the frequencies of these variants observed in the population sample at SNV positions was found to be low/insignificant (rho = 0.16, p-value = 0.38). These results may demonstrate that the variability at the population level is a dynamic trait and may differ both at different stages of the replication cycle within the same host and across different hosts.",

Various studies relate these features to different genomic mechanisms, which take part in the viral replication cycle and are related to the viral fitness. For example, it was suggested that viral codons may be under selection to improve the translation efficiency, among others, via adaptation to the host tRNA pool (or other translation resources; e.g., [26\u201338]). It was also suggested that translation efficiency is affected not only by single codons, but also by distribution of codon pairs (although it is debated whether this feature is under a direct selection or can be a consequence of distribution of dinucleotides [39\u201342]. In refs [43\u201345] it was shown that CpG pairs are under-represented in many RNA and most small human DNA viruses, in correspondence to dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts. This phenomenon can be related, for example, to the contribution of the CpG stacking base-pairs to RNA folding [46] and/or to the enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG [47]. The stability of the RNA secondary structures can also be affected by the genomic GC content [48]. By analyzing local genomic regions of 100 codons we found that regions surrounding the positions of SNVs were characterized by a significantly lower CpG content (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p-value = 0.004) compared to regions of the same size that didn\u2019t contain any SNV (Fig. 5). As was explained above, the higher mutation rates in the CpG suppressed regions may be associated with a stronger evolutionary pressure, possibly related to RNA folding or to the interaction with the immune system. However, we did not find any significant differences between the SNV and non-SNV regions with respect to the rest of the analyzed features (see Additional file 1, section 1).",

Second, the synthetic variants can be analyzed based on comparative genomics tools; this includes the comparisons of the variants to each other and to WT genomes. Among others, this study demonstrates the interactions between comparative genomics and other research tools in synthetic virology. Specifically, we report here for the first time a set of SNVs that appear in a master wildtype DENV-2 virus in comparison to its synthetic constructs. In general, the wildtype virus was found to have a higher genomic variability (i.e. more nucleotide variations) than its synthetic strains. It is known that the population of viral variants is important for its fitness [24, 25]; thus, this analysis demonstrates an approach for connecting viral fitness to the structure of its population.",

Also, infection with the synthetic virus resulted in higher serum viral RNA titers (as measured 3 dpi) and more consistent and high levels of neutralizing Ab (as measured 14 dpi) as compared to infection with the wildtype DENV-2. These findings may be related to the already mentioned fact that the synthetic virus includes lower levels of genomic sequence variability. RNA viruses are often defined as quasispecies [50], collections of closely related mutant spectra or mutant clouds. The fact that a virus exists as a \u2018cloud\u2019 of closely related genomes constitutes an evolutionary advantage, among others by enabling the virus to efficiently adjust to different hosts or cells. Therefore, higher level of variability in the wildtype virus may improve its replication rate in hosts such as Vero cells (the origin of the investigated wildtype virus) and/or humans/A. aegypti, but on the other hand, decrease its fitness/replication rate in mice. It is also possible that the wildtype virus undergoes a direct selection for reduced virulence (among others this may be related to its variability) which actually increases its transmissibility and fitness [51].",

The RNA and protein levels of these libraries will be measured in cell lines and model organisms and the mutations will be connected to the observed measurements and to other viral phenotypes (e.g. cytopathic effect).",

We applied this pipeline to generate synthetic Dengue viruses and compare them to their wildtype master strain. In particular, we showed that although the synthetic Dengue viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, was similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype. The described approach can be performed on any RNA virus and can be used as a platform technology for rational design and synthesis of oncolytic RNA viruses and live attenuated vaccines.",
