Therefore, we stress that strict adherence to other hygienic measures by medical staff and patient\u2019s relatives is clearly of crucial importance [23, 24]. Hand washing is the single most important procedure in the prevention of nosocomial infections, yet it remains the most violated of all infection control procedures [23, 24]. It is conceivable that placing children in a cohort generates considerable peer and parental pressure to ensure that measures such as hand washing are followed.",

It is well possible that prolonged sharing of rooms increases the incidence of cross-infections. For practical and safety reasons, we deliberately chose to perform the study under these specific circumstances as a proof of principle, before embarking on a similar project with room sharing during the entire admission.",
