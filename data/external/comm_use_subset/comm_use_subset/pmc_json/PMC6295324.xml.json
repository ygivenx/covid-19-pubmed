The Pfam protein families database (Finn et al. 2016) of >16,000 protein domains is available (Pfam 31.0 at http://Pfam.xfam.org/). Within the Pfam collection, each domain family is defined by a manually selected and aligned set of protein sequences, which is used to construct a profile HMM of the domain. The HMM domain concept and search algorithms for generating and detecting profile HMMs have gone through a number of refinements and a current rapid implementation for finding profile HMMs in novel sequences is HMMER3 (http://hmmer.org/, Eddy 2011).",

The Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) site has a useful compilation of Pfam domains found in specific virus families (https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg? decorator=vipr) however the catalog is currently limited to fourteen virus families while the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) currently recognizes ninty-six virus families (Lefkowitz et al. 2018). The use of profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for virus classification and discovery was recently reviewed (Reyes et al. 2017). The use of an HMM structure as the basis for sequence classification has the potential to identify more distant members of protein domain family. Both Metavir (Roux et al. 2011) and VirSorter (Roux et al. 2015) make extensive use of protein domains as part of effective virus classification algorithms. The implementation VirSorter is primarily focused on identifying novel bacteriophage sequences. MetLab (Norling et al. 2016) and vFAM (Skewes-Cox et al. 2014) methods have demonstrated the utility of such a protein domain classification approach. ClassyFlu (Van der Auwera et al. 2014) builds influenza subtype specific profile HMM-defined protein domains for the HA coding region and then uses this database of HMMs to classify test influenza HA segments.",

Consistent with observation at the full genome scale, phylogenetic analyses suggested that the Vietnamese bat Alphacoronaviruses belonged to two lineages; viruses in the one lineage are closely related (sharing 94\u201396 per cent nt identities) to Scotophilus bat CoVs strains A515 (DQ648719), A527 (DQ648791), CYCU-S1/TW/2013 (KT346372), and 512 (NC_009675), while viruses in the second lineage were more distantly related (sharing 75\u201376 per cent nt identities) to the four previously mentioned bat CoVs strains (Fig. 7B). The CoVs identified from Vietnamese rats were classified as Betacoronavirus and belonged to two distinct lineages as shown in phylogenetic tree (Fig. 7B); viruses from one lineage closely related to the CoV strain HKU24 from Hongkong (KM349743, Lau et al. 2015), while viruses in the second lineage are more related to the rat CoV strains Longquan-189 (KF294370) and -370 (KF294371) (Wang et al. 2015) and rat CoVs from China (KY370051, KY370049, KY37048, and KY370043).",

The classification is not dependent on a single domain, but rather the composite score of all domains present in the query sequence. This is a strength of the method that can limit false positive identifications which might be due for example, to shorter regions of homology to a bacterial or host or repetitive sequence. The requirement for longer sequence contigs is also a weakness of the method as sufficient query sequence must be available to encode multiple protein domains. This also limits the tool to assembled contigs rather than short read data. In other words, the sensitivity of the classification is directly dependent upon the length of the genomic sequences, that is, higher sensitivity of genus assignment with longer or complete genome sequence. The classification tool provides a robust, rapid, and alignment-free method to classify large sets of more distantly related sequences. Once a database is generated, the algorithm can be used in the field or resource-limited settings and the classification can be performed with typical contig sets within minutes on a standard laptop. With the availability of the platform independent Docker version of the algorithm (see Section 2), scientists can easily run the analyses on any computing platform.",

An additional consideration is that the genus classification of individual Coronaviridae genomes in GenBank may not be correct (mis-annotation), that the genome sequences may include errors (machine errors, PCR errors, chimeric sequences) or have been assembled incorrectly or with sequence duplications or deletions (mis-assemblies).

As part of a large-scale zoonotic surveillance in Vietnam (Rabaa et al. 2015), we applied agnostic deep sequencing to 177 bat and 391 rat samples from a single location. The sample collection was from the Dong Thap province in southern Vietnam where humans and domestic and farm animals live in close proximity. The site is 154 km from Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city in south of Vietnam. From this modest sample size surveillance, forty-four complete or nearly complete genomes belonging to Coronaviridae family were identified, thirty-four of which were from bat samples belonging to the Alphacorovirus genus and eleven genomes from ten rat samples belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus. The bat fecal samples were pooled material from five to ten individuals, thus the total individual bats samples screened ranged from 885 to 1,770 and the frequency of full genome identification was 1.9\u20134.0 per cent (34/1,770 to 34/855). In comparison, the 391 screened rat samples were derived from individual fecal pellets and frequency of the coronavirus genome identification was 2.8 per cent (11/391).
