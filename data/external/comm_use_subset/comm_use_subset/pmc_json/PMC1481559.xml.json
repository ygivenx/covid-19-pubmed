            "text": "The control of diseases associated with highly variable RNA viruses requires close monitoring of the variant virus types that periodically dominate in viral populations. This is due to high mutation rates, quasispecies dynamics and population bottlenecks that often accompany virus transmission [reviewed in [1]]. Indeed, RNA viruses replicate with mutation rates in the range of 10-3 to 10-5 substitutions per nucleotide copied [2,3]. As a consequence, RNA virus populations consist of complex and dynamic distributions of related genomes termed viral quasispecies [4,5]. Viral quasispecies can influence viral pathogenesis [6-8], and the response to antiviral treatments [9]. Mutant clouds in infected organisms represent the first stage in the natural genetic and antigenic diversification of viruses [8,10]. A consequence which is relevant to viral diagnosis and surveillance is that a transmission bottleneck may result in the establishment in the recipient host of one (or few) variant(s) sampled from the mutant cloud that replicates in the infected donor. Therefore, methodology to discern among minor variants of the same viral genotype or serotype is essential for epidemiological surveillance and the planning of disease control strategies.",

            "text": "An important animal pathogen which participates of quasispecies dynamics, transmission bottlenecks, and the potential for rapid evolution is foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the etiological agent of the economically most devastating disease of farm animals [recent reviews in [11]]. FMDV is an aphthovirus of the family Picornaviridae, whose genome is a single stranded RNA of about 8200 nucleotides, of positive polarity, replicated by a virus-coded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, devoid of a proofreading-repair activity [12]. The antigenic variation of FMDV is a direct consequence of its genetic variation during natural infections, confirmed by many experiments in vivo and in cell culture [11,13]. Inactivated virus vaccines are used to control FMD, but their efficacy is limited by the antigenic variation of the virus [11]. The antigenic diversity of FMDV is reflected in the occurrence of seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3), and multiple subtypes and variants that defy classification due to the continuous recognition of mutant forms in replicating FMDV quasispecies [14]. In vaccination-challenge experiments no cross-protection is observed among representatives of a different serotype, and only partial protection among some subtypes and variants [11]. Therefore, continuous monitoring of circulating antigenic forms is required to prepare vaccines whose antigenic composition matches that of the circulating virus [11].",

Recently, several methods based on reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification have been adapted to the diagnosis of FMDV [16]. Some of these methods can be applied without the need to grow the virus in cell culture. More recently, a FMD DNA chip containing 155 oligonucleotide probes to detect simultaneously the seven FMDV serotypes has been described [17]. Several studies have documented that long oligonucleotide DNA microarrays can detect simultaneously many viral pathogens [18]. Multiple oligoprobes were used to characterize the heterogeneous composition and recombination forms of human poliovirus [19]. These results encourage the development of a new microarray-based approach to probe the fine genetic and antigenic composition of FMDV for diagnosis, vaccine design, and to gain insight into the molecular epidemiology of this pathogen.",

            "text": "A major antigenic site of FMDV (termed site A) is located at the mobile, exposed G-H loop of capsid protein VP1 [13,20,21]. This loop includes several epitopes involved in binding of neutralizing antibodies, as well as an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) triplet that participates in recognition of integrin receptors [21,22]. The overlap of residues involved in receptor recognition and antibody binding implies that variations at the G-H loop of VP1 can have consequences both for the antigenic behavior of the virus and its host range [23,24]. For FMDV of serotype C multiple variants at the epitopes located within antigenic site A were documented among natural populations of the virus. Furthermore, studies in cell culture have shown that FMDV can evolve towards variants with altered RGD that display a remarkable expansion of host cell tropism [25]. The several biological implications of the G-H loop of VP1 prompted us to develop a DNA oligonucleotide microarray to probe multiple genetic variants of FMDV, around VP1 residues 139 to 147 (Figure 1). We report assay conditions that have been optimized to detect the presence of several point mutants at this major antigenic site of FMDV, and develop a support vector machine (SVM)-based procedure to automatize sample classification hybridization intensities and to set up limits for reliable diagnosis.",

Two variants (encoding RGD and RED at VP1 positions 141\u2013143) (Figures 1 and 2) of FMDV were initially tested. A microarray with both FMDV variants was printed to analyze the influence of long (15-mer) versus short (11-mer) oligonucleotides, the presence or absence of (dT)15 spacers, and the oligonucleotide concentration. A number of conclusions were drawn from the results (not shown). First, the hybridization signals were weaker with oligonucleotides of 11 residues than with oligonucleotides of 15 residues. We have not assessed oligonucleotides longer than 15 residues because they are more likely to accommodate, without destabilization of the helical duplex, a single nucleotide mismatch at a central position [26]. The second observation was that oligonucleotides linked through a (dT)15 track hybridized more efficiently than those without the track in agreement with previous results [27]. Third, the experiments indicated that the amount of oligonucleotide attached at concentrations between 5 and 50 \u03bcM was not limiting for detection of fluorescent DNAs. We chose the highest concentration tested for the standard protocol. Preliminary experiments showed also that hybridization solutions including 50% formamide resulted in poor sensitivity, and that the Unyhib solution (Arrayit) produced results comparable to those obtained with the hybridization solution described in Methods. To generate labeled targets, two different systems were used: direct labeling with Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP, and indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 647; the latter proved easier, more reproducible, efficient and yielded targets showing higher stability.",

Exceptions include phenotypes RGE1 and RGV, with about 93% prediction accuracy. In order to study the distribution of errors, a confusion matrix is shown in Table 2. The matrix reveals that the small fraction of errors observed shows a systematic distribution. Thus, misclassified RGE samples are systematically classified as S139T samples, while a misclassified RGV sample is classified within the RGD variant, and a misclassified V144 sample is assigned to the RED mutant. Most likely, the observed errors have their origin in hybridization artefacts, and will probably be corrected in future versions of the chip.

The microarray contained 155 oligonucleotide probes, of 35 to 45 residues from the VP3-VP1-2A-coding region of the FMDV genome. We have now used a specific approach based on a microarray platform aimed at distinguishing point mutants within an important determinant of antigenicity and host cell tropism, namely the G-H loop of capsid protein VP1 (Figures 1 and 2). Several preliminary experiments showed a notorious decrease in the quality of results using aldehyde coated slides, streptavidine coated magnetic beads to obtain single-stranded DNA or a formamide hybridization solution. Additionally, other conditions involving nucleotide probes of different length, presence or absence of spacers between the array substrate and the probe, and different labeling and hybridization conditions were tested. The best signal to noise ratios and the most reproducible results were achieved using 15-mer with oligo (dT)15 spacer and 50 \u03bcM concentrated oligonucleotide probes, with the queried position located towards the center of the probe, printed of super-epoxi-coated slides (experimental conditions detailed in Methods).

This procedure revealed a high and stable degree of classification accuracy, although 2 variants were misclassified in more than 5% of cases. This was probably due to heterogeneity in the intensity of the hybridization reactions (Table 1 and 2). Despite this limitation in the reliable identification of some variants, the results illustrate the feasibility of a microarray approach to diagnose specific virus variants that may be associated with altered biological behaviors. Thus, the queried mutation was accurately discriminated from other mutations at the same site (Figure 4). In particular, the conserved L147 in VP1 is thought to be essential for integrin recognition of FMDV [29], and several substitutions at position 147 affect the interaction of FMDV of serotype C with antibodies. A variant with substitution L147P was isolated from a lesion of partially immunized cattle and had a profound effect on the antigenicity and tropism of FMDV [23]. This important L147P variant was correctly detected by the microarray. Crosshybridizations were observed with the probes to identify mutations that affect VP1 positions 142 and 143 (Figure 4b), expected from the high degree of overlap among these probes. This crosshybridization can be defined as the signal obtained when at least 9 nucleotides of a probe are perfect match with the target. For instance, mutant RGN shows a weak signal with the RGG probe, and the RGE mutant with the L144 probe. The two amino acids replaced in those variants are also essential for integrin recognition of FMDV [29].",

In this report, we have documented that DNA microarray technology can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze polymorphisms within a short region of the FMDV genome, and have successfully devised a SVM-based method to classify the samples on the basis of their hybridization signal. The procedure is of general applicability as a test for specificity and discriminatory power of microarray-based diagnostic procedures using multiple probes. We are currently investigating an extension of the same methodology to detect minority genomes in viral populations, as a means to quantify mutant spectrum complexity, and to evaluate memory levels in viral quasispecies [8,10,24].",

For each spot in the array, measures for the mean and median foreground intensity and for the mean and median background intensities were available. Visual inspection of scanned hybridized arrays revealed some noise due to the presence of dust and scratches, introducing an uneven increase in the mean foreground signal for some spots. We have tried to detect the affected spots by calculating a Z-score of their mean foreground intensity per pixel, using the four measurements available for each probe in every hybridization experiment. For this, we have used the additional measures available for the same probe (median foreground intensity and replicated spot mean and median foreground intensity) and computed their average and standard deviation. Then we calculated the Z-score in the usual way, subtracting the average from the mean foreground intensity and then dividing it by the standard deviation. After testing several absolute Z-score thresholds for discarding spots, we have found that a Z-score of 7 provides optimal results. If neither of the spots is discarded, we take as a measure for the presence of each mutant in the sample (Ma), the log2 of the average of its replicated spots mean foreground intensities, subtracted from its background:",

It belongs to the class of methods that solve the general problem of learning discriminative boundaries, able to optimally separate positive and negative members of a given set of points in a n-dimensional vector space. The SVM algorithm operates by first mapping the training set into a high-dimensional feature space and then attempting to locate in that space a hyperplane that separates positive from negative examples. Having found such a hyperplane, the SVM can then predict the classification of an unlabeled example by mapping it into the feature space and asking on which side of the separating plane the example is found. The multiclass SVM is an extension of the classification problem to multiple classes, instead of just a binary classification.",
