            "text": "Translation initiation can be described as a scanning model triggered by a cap- and 5\u2019 end-dependent mechanism, or can be mediated by a cap- and 5\u2019 end-independent manner through an RNA element termed as \u201cinternal ribosomal entry site\u201d (IRES). The scanning machine recognizes and binds to the methylated 5\u2019-end cap structure of a mRNA and scans linearly downstream until it reaches an AUG codon for the initiation of protein translation [1]. In contrast to the canonical translation initiation, the IRES directs the ribosomal translation due to form specific secondary and tertiary structures that interact directly with the translational machinery. IRES elements were first described in the 5' nontranslated region of mRNAs of the Picornaviridae, which lacks a methylated cap structure at the 5\u2019 end [2]. The IRES may have an important role as a virulence factor, in addition, the identification of IRES element of pathogenic viruses is also a key point for the treatment of the viruses-infected diseases. Moreover, the IRES element can be applied in the development of bi-cistronic expression vector, an important tool for the biotechnology. Thus, it is important to develop a bioinformatic tool for the prediction and identification of IRES element(s) in a virus\u2019s genome.",

The IRES element prediction might depend on RNA structure similarity because of the functional contraction. The ameliorative RNA structure prediction will therefore be useful to enhance the accuracy of secondary structure prediction of IRES elements. We have developed an IRES search system named IRSS that combined two RNA structure prediction models: comparative sequence analysis, and minimum free energy structure [7]. Comparative sequence analysis has a 97% accuracy of base pairs in ribosomal RNA secondary structures, and minimum free energy (MFE) structure prediction can predict the structure of a single RNA sequence with an average of 73% accuracy [8]. However, comparative sequence analysis is not useful to predict the mRNA regulatory motifs such as IRES [9,10].",

            "text": "Recently, RNA pseudoknot structure has been demonstrated to play important roles in many biological processes, including building of the catalytic core of some ribozymes [11]. From cryo-electron microscopy structure information of HCV IRES, the pseudoknot element might bind to the initiation codon of the mRNA that has attached the binding cleft with the 40S ribosomal subunit [12,13]. The intergenic region (IGR) IRES of Plautia stali intestine virus contains three pseudoknot structures; two located on 5\u2032-terminal 143 nucleotides for binding of the IGR IRES to the 40S ribosome, and one 3\u2032-terminal pseudoknot involved in decoding of the non-AUG codon used for initiation [14]. Thus, the pseudoknot structure might be one of important parameters in determining the IRES elements and might be used to improve the accuracy of IRES prediction. The program, pknotsRG, adopted an algorithm to calculate the thermodynamic stability of pseudoknots, which can predict a restricted class of pseudoknots [15].",

            "text": "For the RNA structure and sequence comparative tools, many pattern searching programs and web services have been developed, such as Rfam from the Sanger Institute [16]. Rfam adopted multiple RNA sequence alignments using covariance models to represent consensus primary sequences of non-coding RNA families. Moreover, there are twelve IRES models built upon consensus sequences in Rfam database. Unfortunately, the lower homology between different IRES groups will cause inaccuracy of prediction using primary sequences [9,10]. The RNA structure prediction will therefore be useful to enhance the accuracy of de novo secondary structure prediction of IRES elements. To develop a new IRES search tool which is able to predict all four viral IRES groups, the viral IRES prediction system (VIPS) was constructed and based on secondary structure prediction, structure comparison and pseudoknot structure calculation. In contrast to Rfam, IRSS, the previous prediction system and VIPS will be more specific for IRES prediction [7]. VIPS will scan neighboring regions for structure prediction and avoid short consensus primary sequence problems to improve IRES structure predictions. The VIPS also added pknotsRG that will enhance the accuracy of predicting the IRES structures with regards to the function of pseudoknot binding with 40S ribosome. Previous IRES search system (IRSS) can provide up to 72.3% accuracy of secondary structure prediction for IRES group 2 [7]. The VIPS has higher accuracy than IRSS and is a useful search platform for IRES prediction due to more competent standard IRES elements and parameters of VIPS. The web searching service of VIPS provides a new IRES search tool which can assist in defining the IRES elements. In addition, the VIPS will also provide a useful source for IRES location before experimental study. The VIPS will be a public resource, and can facilitate the scientific community not only to as an analyzing tool, but also as means of communication by providing feedbacks.",

            "text": "Three key steps are the backbone of the viral IRES prediction system (VIPS): 1) RNA folding, 2) RNA secondary structure comparison and 3) pknotsRG program. First, RNAL fold program functions to predict the RNA secondary structure using the minimum free energy method [17]. Next, the RNA secondary structure comparison matches the known IRES structures executed by RNA Align program [18]. Finally, the pknotsRG calculates the pseudoknot score from potential IRES structures [15]. In our designed VIPS, the primary RNA sequence input in the search flowchart (see Figure 1), with default length parameter (L=250, previous results [7]), is transferred as a raw RNA sequences into RNAL fold input format by perl scripts (UTR2SQ.pl and utr_dp.pl) (Methods S1) [7]. The Start_analyze.pl is the major control batch program to link each stage of VIPS. In RNA align software, two factors are considered to evaluate the IRES elements that can be predicted by our VIPS, distance score (DIST) and alignment match length (ALEN). DIST represents the score of secondary structure in comparison with the default score of each RNA structure (base-deletion, base-mismatch, arc-mismatch, are-removing, arc-altering and arc-breaking) adopted in RNA align software. Because DIST value will increase concomitantly with longer alignment length, DIST score fails to specify the significance of matched structures from shorter and bigger alignment sequences. Therefore, DIST and ALEN are transformed into a ratio which is defined as R= ALEN/DIST [7]. The R values are collected from all predicted IRES elements including known IRES and potential candidate IRES elements. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) analyzes all R values to make a discriminant line that distinguishes candidate IRES group and non-IRES group. The error rate of VIPS is estimated in comparison of known IRES structures with candidate IRES elements. All parameters were succeeded from our previous IRSS setting [7]. The output data of RNAL fold program is re-transformed into RNA Align format by B2RA.pl program (Methods S1). For RNA view, B2CT.pl (Methods S1) changes the predicted RNA secondary structure into \u201cconnect file format\u201d (*.ct) which will read by RnaViz [19] to display in screen and print. Two output files, Aligned structure and Alignment score files, were generated by RNA Align software. 2 statistical programs, DIST.R and sort.R, were applied to select all predicted RNA structures with R scores higher than best cut-off value [7]. The perl script, run_pknotsRG.pl, re-formats all candidate RNA structure into input format of pknotsRG software (Methods S1). All of the output results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were evaluated their value by statistic programs. The predicted figure of RNAL fold program and text results of RNA Align and pknotsRG software were showed as web page while their values are higher than cut-off value.",

The standard structures were fetched from four known groups of IRES elements based on Cricket paralysis virus (Group 1, accession number: AF218039), Hepatitis C virus (Group 2, accession number: AF177037), Encephalomyocarditis virus (Group 3, accession number: X74312.1) and Poliovirus (Group 4, accession number: V01148.1). Those standard IRES templates were applied into VIPS to calculate the appropriate individual R value and pseudoknot value from RNAL fold, RNA Align and pknotsRG programs. The R value of VIPS presents a score for match length (ALEN) divided distance score (DIST) that distributes into two separate groups, IRES-candidate group and negative group, when the cut-off value was determined [7]. For positive groups, all verified IRES elements (Table S1) of the four viral families (groups 1~4) fetched from NCBI GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Rfam database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/) were run through VIPS to calculate and classify into four IRES groups. Their R and pseudoknot values were collected as training data. For negative groups, the all known coding sequences without IRES elements of Poliovirus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, Hepatitis C virus and Cricket paralysis virus were input into VIPS to analyze their R and pseudoknot values. For each IRES group, the cut-off values were estimated from the positive group and negative group by linear discriminant analysis. The cut-off value is 1.61, 1.98, 1.87, and 1.58 of R value for IRES group 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively (Table 1; Figure 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d).

The development of the IRES element prediction system will help scientists predict the potential IRES elements prior to experimentations. However, most of the current software aims to predict the RNA secondary structure but not specifically predict the IRES elements, an example as Mfold [20]. To verify the accuracy of VIPS, IRES elements from three major related databases; experimentally verified IRES database (http://www.iresite.org), Rfam database (http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/), and UTR database (http://www.ba.itb.cnr.it/UTR/) were collected and applied in our study. This helped in building a better and more useful IRES search system than the previous version, IRSS, which has been operated for over 2 years. The sensitivity of IRSS is less than 72% in IRES group 2 (IRES type 3), moreover, other IRES groups showed 40~70% accuracy in IRSS. The VIPS showed 92.28%, 90.26%, 82.36%, and 77.60% of accuracy rate for IRES group 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, without pseudoknot module. The sensitivity of group 1 is 87.5% and specificity is 97.06%. For group 2, the sensitivity is 80.52% and specificity is 100%. In addition, the sensitivity is 64.71% and 56.34%, and specificity is 100% and 98.85% for groups 3 and 4, respectively. Thus, this pseudoknot module was required to improve the accuracy of IRES prediction. The VIPS contains RNA pseudoknot prediction module and four individual IRES group alignment functions in a IBM workstation with 2 CPU containing 8 cores on board.",

The sensitivity and accuracy were also enhanced from 80.52% to 81.59% and 90.26% to 90.80% in group 2. Unfortunately, pseudoknot module does not improve the sensitivity and accuracy for IRES group 3 structures. RNA pseudoknot structure is found in RNA catalysts,folded RNA, ribosome and telomerase. Current evidences showed that pseudoknots act a key structural role in bringing distant regions of single-stranded RNA together to form core helices that were composed with Watson-Crick base pairs [21]. Pseudoknot structures also regulate IRESs, because pseudoknots have been demonstrated to stimulate the efficiency of translational recoding events that include redefined stop codon and ribosomal frameshifting [22]. In addition, pseudoknot containing transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) can rescue stalled ribosomes that reached the 3\u2032 end of an mRNA lacking a termination codon during translation elongation [23]. In viruses, pseudoknots have been identified in a number of IRESs and their function has been proven in the flavivirus HCV and the dicistrovirus cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) [3,24]. And, HCV IRES domains function synergistically to locate the AUG sequence into the ribosomal peptidyl (P) site that might couple the movement of the pseudoknot with HCV IRES domain 3d. With pseudoknot, false positive values of VIPS prediction are 2.94%, 0.00%, 0.00%, and 1.63%, and false negative values are 0.00%, 18.41%, 35.29%, and 37.56% both for IRES group 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.",

However, positive group may contain other viruses which might have potential IRES elements. For example, Human rhinovirus C (NC_009996) has high R value (1.74) in 423-626 nucleotides. The pseudoknot function will select more candidate IRES elements for group 4, such as Porcine enterovirus B (data not shown). For group 3, Foot-and-mouth disease virus (NC_004915) and Human cosavirus (NC_012802) are the major families of positive group with pseudoknot function.

Another ssRNA positive strand virus, Dengue virus (NC_001477), has been discovered as potential IRES element with pseudoknots and has been proven by mutagenesis experiments [26]. Without pseudoknot structure, the sensitivity of VIPS is reduced for IRES group 2 due to HCV structure containing pseudoknot. For IRES group 1, Himetobi P virus (NC_003782) showed the highest percentage in the positive group by VIPS (1.93 with pseudoknot score). Moreover, Diaporthe ambigua RNA virus 1 (NC_001278), 3947-4111 nucleotides, has potential IRES element (R value is 1.60, without pseudoknot). In group 1 prediction, there is no significant difference with pseudoknot function or not. Recent researches suggest that the Dicistroviridae family might have intergenic IRES from bioinformatic evidence [27] which are matched our predictions. Our results demonstrate that VIPS does not only to predict RNA secondary structures, but also locates the IRES elements in the viral genome. ",

After evaluation of pseudoknot parameter by four IRES standard elements of VIPS, pseudoknot parameters can cover known IRES structures and also avoid the disadvantages of minimum free energy method (data not showed). However, to improve sensitivity and specificity of cellular IRES elements in VIPS, new algorithms can be implemented to simulate real relationships and interactions between 40s rRNA and IRES elements in next version of our prediction system.
