To determine whether TGEV infection regulates the cellular autophagy process by inducing the formation of DMVs, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the formation of autophagosome-like vesicles in TGEV-infected ST and PK15 cells. We observed that the number of double- and single-membrane vesicles increased near the perinuclear region of TGEV-infected ST cells, and that such structures were rare in the mock-treated samples (Fig. 1a). These autophagosome-like vesicles were morphologically identical to the MHV-infected Hela cells6. Similar results were obtained using PK15 cells (Fig. 1b). The number of autophagosome-like vesicles was greater in the cytoplasm of TGEV-infected cells than in the cytoplasm of mock-treated cells (Fig. 1c).",

Therefore, we examined LC3 conversion by western blot assay using an anti-LC3 antibody that recognizes both forms of LC3 during TGEV infection. At the same time, mAb 3D7, which specifically recognizes TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein, was used to estimate the infection progress. The results showed that the expression levels of LC3-II were upregulated in TGEV-infected ST cells relative to mock-treated cells (Fig. 2a). Because the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I is regarded as an accurate indicator of autophagic activity23, we further assessed the densitometric ratios of LC3-II to LC3-I. As shown in Fig. 2b, the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio significantly increased from 24 to 30 h post infection (hpi) in TGEV-infected cells relative to controls; in addition, TGEV N protein was detected at 6 hpi and increased sharply between 24\u201330 hpi, which was consistent with the increase of LC3-II. By contrast, no obvious changes of the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio were observed in mock-treated cells (Fig. 2a,b). TGEV infection-induced autophagy was also assessed using PK15 cells. As was the case with ST cells, the relative amount of LC3-II significantly increased as TGEV infection of PK15 cells progressed over time, although the rate of increase in TGEV infection were slower in PK15 cells than in ST cells (Fig. 2c,d). Taken together, these data suggest that autophagosomes accumulated in TGEV-infected cells.",

To determine whether TGEV replication is required for the induction of autophagy, we challenged cells with either replication-competent or UV-inactivated virus and measured the effect on autophagy by monitoring the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Before conducting the formal experiments, we used immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to verify that the UV-inactivated virus was replication defective (Fig. 3a). By using western blot, we found that the levels of both LC3-I and LC3-II were similar in ST cells inoculated with UV-inactivated TGEV at MOI of 10 and in mock-treated ST cells at 24 h post inoculation; in addition, no N protein synthesis was detected in ST cells inoculated with UV-inactivated TGEV. In contrast, ST cells infected with replication-competent TGEV apparently underwent the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 3b,c). Similar results were obtained with PK15 cells (Fig. 3b,c), suggesting that TGEV replication is required for the formation of autophagosomes.",

Because p62/SQSTM1 serves as a link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, and because inhibition of autophagy leads to an increase in the levels of p62, p62 degradation is considered an indicator of autophagic flux2227. Therefore, we used a western blot assay to measure the changes in p62 protein levels upon virus infection. As shown in Fig. 4a,b, TGEV infection increased degradation of p62 in ST cells over time. There was no significant alteration of p62 between 0 h and 36 h in the mock-treated control. These data indicate that the accumulation of autophagosomes induced by TGEV infection is due to autophagic activation rather than to a block in autophagosome maturation.",

The fusion protein GFP-LC3 is relatively stable, but the low pH in the autolysosome quenches the GFP fluorescent signal. RFP-LC3, in contrast, exhibits more stable fluorescence in acidic compartments, which makes the GFP-RFP-LC3 tandem construct useful for assessing autophagosome dynamics2829. Therefore, ST cells were transfected with GFP-RFP-LC3 plasmid and then were infected with TGEV before live cell imaging was used to examine the dynamics of autophagosome maturation. In TGEV-infected cells, the GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3 puncta formed a yellow autophagosome by the 10-h frame (Fig. 5a). Subsequently, the yellow puncta turned red, most likely as a result of the quenching of GFP-LC3 fluorescence in the acidic amphisomes or autolysosomes (Fig. 5a & movie, data not shown); this change in color indicated the maturation of autophagosomes. In mock-treated cells, in contrast, the few yellow or red LC3 puncta represent the baseline range of autophagic flux. To confirm that the autophagic puncta are not derived from apoptotic blebs, we performed apoptosis staining during the infection. As shown in Fig. 5b, there was no increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells at 10, 12, and 18 hpi in infected cells relative to mock-treated cells; at 30 hpi, some virus-infected cells began to be apoptosis positive. Collectively, the results demonstrate that TGEV infection leads to the degradation of p62 protein via the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, suggesting that virus infection significantly increases autophagic flux.",

To accomplish this, we exposed the cells to wortmannin or LY294002, both of which can inhibit autophagy at an early stage by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway30. As shown in Fig. 6a,d, wortmannin and LY294002 pretreatment reduced the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in TGEV-infected ST cells, indicating that the virus-induced autophagy is inhibited by these two compounds. As indicated by IFA, treatment of cells with either wortmannin (Fig. 6b) or LY294002 (Fig. 6e) increased the percentage of infected cells by 3- or 2-fold, respectively, relative to untreated cells. An increase in the titers of progeny virus in the cells treated with wortmannin or LY294002 was confirmed by measuring the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) (Fig. 6c,f). These data indicate that virus-induced autophagy may protect cells from TGEV infection.",

These three genes were examined to confirm that the effects observed were due to the autophagy pathway rather than to the non-target effects of the siRNA. To deplete the proteins, we treated ST cells with siRNA duplexes for 24 h and then challenged the cells with TGEV. When cells were separately treated with each of the three siRNA duplexes, the levels of LC3, ATG5, and ATG7 mRNA were decreased in each case relative to levels in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7a, 8a and 9a). Western blot analysis of detergent lysates collected from cells revealed that levels of endogenous LC3, ATG5, or ATG7 protein were significantly lower in cells treated with the siRNA duplexes than in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7b, 8b and 9b). Because the data indicated that knockdown efficiency was greatest with LC3-specific siRNA duplexes 3#, ATG5-specific siRNA duplexes 1#, and ATG7-specific siRNA duplexes 2#, these specific siRNA duplexes were used in the following experiments. Following the knockdown of each autophagy-related gene with these gene-specific siRNA duplexes, we observed an increase in the percentage of TGEV-infected cells in comparison to the nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7c, 8c and 9c). We also found that autophagic protein depletion led to increased viral titers (Figs 7d, 8d and 9d). Together, the data demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy promotes TGEV replication.",

Previous research demonstrated that acetyltransferase p300 can degrade LC3, ATG5, and ATG7 by post-translational modifications in Hela cells, and that knockdown of p300 can accelerate autophagy36. We treated ST cells with p300 siRNA duplexes for 24 h and then infected them with TGEV. As shown in Fig. 11a, p300 siRNA-transfected ST cells had decreased levels of the endogenous acetyltransferase p300 protein and increased levels of LC3-II, ATG5, and ATG7 proteins, suggesting that p300 negatively regulates autophagy in ST cells. In addition, knockdown efficiency was greater for p300 siRNA duplexes 2# than for the other duplexes, and p300 siRNA duplexes 2# was therefore used for further study. Using IFA, we found that the percentage of TGEV-positive cells was lower in cells treated with the p300 siRNA duplexes 2# than in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Fig. 11b). The reduction in viral replication determined by IFA was verified by measuring the TCID50 (Fig. 11c).

Although this virus was identified 30 years ago43, the interactions between TGEV replication and host cell responses are incompletely understood. Previous studies revealed that infection by several other coronaviruses, including MHV, SARS-CoV, IBV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, induced the formation of DMVs61844454647. In the present study, TEM revealed that the formation of DMVs, which is a hallmark of coronavirus replication, was greatly induced in both ST and PK15 cells during TGEV infection. The presence of DMVs suggested that this virus might induce the accumulation of autophagic vesicles in TGEV-infected cells. Using immunoblotting to evaluate LC3 modification, we then confirmed that the induction of DMVs by TGEV infection was related to the autophagic process. Additionally, we found that viral replication is required in TGEV-induced autophagy. Although DMVs exist in the TGEV-infected cells, we did not know whether this alphacoronavirus species, like betacoronavirus species, hijacks the autophagosome machinery to facilitate virus replication46. Further work is needed to conclusively answer this question. Nevertheless, our findings clearly demonstrate that TGEV infection induces the accumulation of autophagosomes in target cells, and that the TGEV replication process is required for the induction of autophagic activity.",

Previous reports showed that the induction of autophagy by viruses can be due to the formation of autophagosomes or to the inhibition of phagosome maturation2425. Another way to verify the cellular state of autophagy is to monitor autophagic flux, which can be measured by detecting the levels of p62 and the transportation of LC32227. Our immunoblotting results showed that TGEV infection decreases the expression level of p62 protein, indicating that TGEV infection enhances the autophagic flux in target cells. Moreover, by using a GFP-RFP-LC3 tandem construct to morphologically trace autophagic flux, we assessed the maturation of autophagosomes into autolysomes; the results indicated that the accumulation of autophagosomes is due to their de novo formation and not to the inhibition of their maturation. These data demonstrate that there is a potential relationship between the autophagic process and TGEV infection.",

A similar antiviral role for autophagy has been described in response to infection by \u03b1-herpesvirus-1, which is a double-stranded DNA virus5253. An antiviral function of autophagy has also been found in another RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)54. In the present study, we pharmacologically inhibited the formation of autophagosomes and consequently increased virus replication; this finding was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of three highly conserved endogenous genes required for autophagy. These results are consistent with the role of autophagy in cell-autonomous defense against microbial invasion85556. Accordingly, we found that inhibition of autophagy increases TGEV replication.",

However, Prentice et al. reported that MHV utilizes the cell\u2019s autophagic machinery to facilitate virus replication18. These observations suggest that replication mechanisms may differ among viruses of the same family and even of the same species; these differences may be related to differences in cell-type specificity or in mechanisms of infection. Therefore, to determine whether the induction of autophagy is an anti-TGEV response, we examined the effect of controlled autophagosomal activation on virus replication. Our data showed that rapamycin treatment induced autophagy, which then inhibited virus replication, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of autophagy might be a useful way to restrict TGEV replication.",

In addition, Huang et al. reported that TGEV infection downregulates acetyltransferase p300 expression and increases cell apoptosis59, suggesting that acetyltransferase p300 is regulated upon TGEV infection. When we knocked down the endogenous p300 in ST cells with specific siRNA duplexes, autophagy was induced, which is consistent with previous findings36, and TGEV replication was reduced. These data indicate that induction of autophagy restricts viral replication. Based on these results, we conclude that autophagy has an antiviral rather than a proviral role in TGEV infection, although the detailed interplay between the autophagic machinery and TGEV and other viruses remains incompletely understood.",
