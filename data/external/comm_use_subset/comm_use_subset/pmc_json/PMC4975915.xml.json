Reports of hemoplasma infections in humans emphasize the need to characterize these agents in more detail [2\u20137]. Feline hemoplasmas can thereby serve as a model because of their extensive molecular and clinical characterization within this group of organisms.",

Concurrent infections with two or three hemoplasma species have been documented [11\u201314], suggesting that no immunological cross-protection exists between the feline hemoplasmas, which has recently been experimentally confirmed [15]. Mhf is the most pathogenic of the three feline hemoplasma species and can induce severe hemolytic anemia, which is potentially fatal if left untreated. In contrast, the other two feline hemoplasmas may induce mild anemia, and the infection often remains subclinical [16].",

            "text": "Different antibiotic regimens reduce hemoplasma blood loads and alleviate clinical signs but, so far, no treatment protocol has successfully and consistently cleared feline hemoplasma infections [21, 23\u201326]. This limitation emphasizes the need to further investigate protective immune mechanisms against these agents. Recently, cats that were experimentally infected with Mhf or CMt and overcame bacteremia were shown to be protected from reinfection with the same hemoplasma species [27, 28]. A study by Novacco et al. [27] suggested a significant role for the humoral immune response in protecting against CMt reinfection: nine out of the ten cats that were protected from reinfection showed intermediate to high antibody levels against CMt before challenge. Furthermore, a transient decrease in antibody levels was observed in the protected cats immediately after attempted reinfection, which could be due to the binding of antibodies to the inoculated antigens. In the early phase after re-challenge, compared with the control group, the protected cats exhibited significantly higher IL-4/IL-12 ratios and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and a pronounced eosinophilia. Therefore, the authors concluded that an early Th2 immune response, prior to the onset of bacteremia, is beneficial for protection against CMt reinfection [27]. This result was not found in the study by Hicks et al. [28], where an early increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was observed in cats protected from Mhf reinfection. Furthermore, the immune response seemed to be skewed towards a Th1 response after primary Mhf infection, whereas a switch from an initial Th1 to a delayed Th2 response was observed after primary CMt infection [27, 28]. These results suggest that cats respond to infection by different feline hemoplasma species with different immune mechanisms.",

The passively immunized and control cats showed no differences in the onset and extent of bacteremia and anemia during the course of Mhf infection. Hicks et al. [28] recently documented that Mhf-recovered cats were protected from reinfection following re-challenge with a homologous Mhf isolate. Our study indicates that the presence of antibodies to Mhf cannot mediate protection against homologous challenge, but that cellular or innate immune mechanisms may be necessary to provide protection against Mhf infection. This is also in line with the study by Hicks et al. [28], which reported protection from Mhf reinfection in the absence of a pronounced Th2-type response in the cats after re-challenge. In the latter study, the protected cats showed no increase in anti-DnaK antibody and IL-10 mRNA levels following Mhf re-challenge.",

It is possible that the level of antibodies in the passively immunized cats following transfusion was not sufficiently high to prevent bacteremia. However, Hicks et al. [28] documented protection from Mhf although the antibody levels to DnaK did not rise after Mhf challenge infection and remained at rather low levels (mean log-transformed relative antibody level (RAL) < 1.2) when compared to the control cats with de novoMhf infection (peak mean RAL > 2.2). They concluded that if Mhf-specific antibodies had been responsible for immune protection in these cats, then low levels of anti-DnaK antibodies could be sufficient to provide protection against Mhf infection. Because the assay and the calculations used to quantify anti-DnaK antibodies in that study were different from those used in the present study, a direct comparison of antibody titers was not possible. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that antibodies with different epitope specificities that are not detected with current DnaK ELISA could mediate immune protection. However, assays to measure such antibodies are not available.",

            "text": "Infection enhancement, i.e. earlier onset of bacteremia and anemia, was recently documented in cats that had recovered from CMt infection and were re-challenged with Mhf [15]. All CMt-recovered cats were serologically positive before Mhf inoculation. The study suggested that the pre-existing antibodies against CMt might have had enhanced infection kinetics in the CMt-recovered cats [15]. Although infection kinetics were not different between the passively immunized and control cats in this study, our results still suggest that the transfer of antibodies from Mhf-recovered cats could potentially be harmful. The passively immunized cats showed a significant increase in RBC OF during the course of infection. This effect was not observed in the control cats, indicating that the increase was not simply due to a non-specific effect of plasma transfusion on RBC fragility. It can be hypothesized that the antibodies bound to the Mhf organisms attached to RBCs. RBC-bound antibodies have been found after primary Mhf infection [16, 39, 40] and can induce receptor-mediated RBC phagocytosis or the activation of the complement system [41]. In the present study, RBC-bound antibodies were not detected in the cats by Coombs test, but the sensitivity of this assay may be limited [42]. The bilirubin concentrations were also higher in the passively immunized versus control cats at some time points during infection. RBC destruction leads to the formation of free hemoglobin, which is processed by the mononuclear phagocytic system. During this process, bilirubin is formed, released in the blood stream and further metabolized and excreted by the liver. During pronounced RBC destruction, the capacity of the liver to metabolize bilirubin is overwhelmed, and hyperbilirubinemia occurs. Hyperbilirubinemia was observed in three cats of group A, although mean bilirubin concentrations in both groups remained within the reference interval. Nevertheless, the higher RBC OF values and occasionally higher bilirubin concentrations could point towards a more pronounced RBC destruction in the passively immunized cats following subsequent Mhf challenge exposure.",

This result was also found in our recent study, where we documented polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia during Mhf infection coinciding with high anti-DnaK antibodies [15]. We speculated that a large portion of the immune globulin pool was not hemoplasma-specific and was potentially due to a polyclonal B lymphocyte activation.

            "text": "It could be argued that the use of the homologous Mhf isolate for experimental challenge of the recipient cats that had been used to infect the plasma donor cats contributed to the more pronounced immune response in the passively immunized cats. This has been reported for other feline pathogens, i.e. feline coronavirus (FCoV) which can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [44]. During the pathogenesis of FIP, the virus targets macrophages and infection of these cells can be enhanced in the presence of antibodies (antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE) [45]. Takano et al. [44] showed that cats passively immunized with antibodies to serotype I FCoV showed an enhanced onset of disease following inoculation with the homologous serotype; this was not found when cats passively immunized with antibodies to serotype II FCoV were challenged with serotype I. The authors concluded that FCoV re-infection with the same serotype might induce ADE and could advance the development of FIP. Although ADE has also been suspected in bacterial infection [46], it is unknown whether it might play a role in the pathogenesis of feline hemoplasma infections [15]. Signs of infection enhancement have recently been documented in \u201cCandidatus M. turicensis\u201d-recovered, seropositive cats following a challenge with Mhf [15]. The study suggested that the presence of antibodies directed against CMt could enhance Mhf infection. However, to the best of our knowledge, disease enhancement after re-challenge with the same feline hemoplasma species has not been documented. In contrast, two studies showed that cats that had recovered from Mhf or CMt infection were protected from re-infection following re-challenge with the same hemoplasma species, respectively [27, 28]. Both studies had used an aliquot of the same Mhf or CMt isolate for re-infection that had been used for primary infection of the cats (personal communication, RHL).",

This comprised decreases in absolute counts of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes around three to 4 weeks pi, and was followed by an increase of the lymphocyte subsets until the end of the study. In two recent studies we reported a very similar pattern in the lymphocyte subsets following Mhf infection of na\u00efve and CMt-recovered cats. The decrease was explained by the migration of the cells from the peripheral blood to the draining lymph nodes, where they become activated and proliferate [15, 28].",

A similar pattern was also observed for the eosinophils, whereas the monocyte counts peaked at the onset of maximal anemia. A decrease in leukocyte and neutrophil counts could be caused by the increased consumption of these cells, which are involved in bacterial killing or, less likely, by reduced production due to undefined inhibitory factors [47]. Monocytosis could be found due to hemolysis [48] and was shown to be associated with Mhf infection in naturally infected cats [49]. We documented leukopenia and neutropenia, as well as decreased eosinophils, lymphocytes and increased monocytes, at times of peak Mhf bacteremia also in a recent study [15]. It is difficult to judge whether the decrease in the white blood cell subsets was due to bacterial replication and cell consumption or, conversely, whether the decrease in white blood cells facilitated bacterial replication.",

Although low-level bacteremia, below the detection limit of the PCR assay, cannot be completely excluded in this cat, we would expect a productive infection to result in seroconversion [20, 50]. Because all cats in this study were kept under strictly controlled hygienic conditions, vector-borne transmission between the cats can be excluded. However, all cats of group B were housed together and four out of five cats in group B tested Mhf PCR-positive at the time that bacteremia and seroconversion occurred in cat JHW3. Therefore, direct transmission between the cats, i.e., by aggressive interactions, seems most likely, although no obvious clinical signs of aggressive interactions were observed in the cats in this study at any time during the experiment. A direct transmission of Mhf through saliva seems unlikely because only low hemoplasma loads can be detected in saliva of Mhf-infected cats [22] and transmission by oral or subcutaneous inoculation of saliva has not been successful for another feline hemoplasma species, CMt [19].",

The inoculated dose contained only 1000 copies of Mhf, which corresponds to approximately 0.05 \u03bcL of infectious blood from a naturally infected cat [22]. This small blood volume can easily be transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods or via aggressive interaction between cats\u2014both of the latter transmission routes are assumed to be natural ways of transmission for feline hemoplasmas [17\u201319].
