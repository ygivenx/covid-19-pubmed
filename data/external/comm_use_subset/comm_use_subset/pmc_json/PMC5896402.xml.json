The occurrence of cachexia markedly complicates the management of cancer patients, negatively impinging on the tolerance and response to antineoplastic treatments, worsening the quality of life, and reducing survival. In particular, about 25% of deaths by cancer are due to cachexia, rather than to the tumor itself [1].",

For this reason, the research on cachexia is focused on two main goals: (i) to find out biomarkers useful to the early identification of a condition of still latent cachexia and (ii) to define treatment protocols useful to delay the progression from precachexia to refractory cachexia.",

Two main reasons account for such delay: (i) autophagy was not considered as typically operated by the skeletal muscle as a response to stress conditions. Such belief was definitely abandoned when autophagy was clearly demonstrated in fasted mice overexpressing green fluorescent protein-labeled LC3 [13]. (ii) The study and detection of autophagy was not easy since the ATG genes were not discovered [14]. A number of studies reported that the autophagic system was overactivated, without reaching complete cargo degradation, in the muscle of both tumor-bearing animals and cancer patients [6, 15\u201317]. In particular, despite autophagic flux was enhanced in mice bearing the C26 tumor, autophagosomes accumulated, likely due to exhaustion of the lysosomal compartment [15]. A similar pattern could also be observed in cancer patients, as suggested by LC3B-II and p62 accumulation [16, 17].",

In this regard, a preliminary cleavage was proposed to be operated by other proteolytic systems, such as those dependent on caspases or calpains. These latter are Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases, normally inactive and localized in the cytosolic compartment. When intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increase, inactive calpains translocate to the cell membrane and become activated by autoproteolysis [18]. The system also includes calpastatin, a physiological inhibitor, which is a substrate of active calpain itself. Increased calpain expression was reported in the muscle of tumor-bearing animals [19], while rats transplanted with the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma showed a progressive reduction of calpastatin levels and increased in vitro cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates [20]. More recently, calpain activation was also demonstrated in mice bearing the C26 colon carcinoma [21]. Both increased or unchanged muscle calpain expression were reported in cancer patients [12, 22].",

Such effects depend, at least in part, on activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, as shown in both experimental and human cancer cachexia patients [25, 26]. Cancer-induced muscle wasting has also been associated with another proinflammatory cytokine, namely, TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) [27].",

The other way round, excessive stimulation of muscle autophagy, experimentally obtained by the overexpression of TP53INP2/DOR, exacerbated muscle atrophy in tumor-bearing mice (unpublished data), while activation of autophagy by means of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was shown to positively affect the skeletal muscle in the C26 hosts [16].

The situation is more complex when studying human pathology. Reduced muscle protein synthesis was reported many years ago in patients affected by different types of tumors [39] and more recently in prostate cancer patients [40].

Particularly interesting in this regard is ghrelin, a mediator released by the stomach during fasting or caloric restriction. Modulations of ghrelin levels exert remarkable effects on both energy and protein metabolism, such as the inhibition of autophagy in conditions characterized by systemic inflammation [50]. The administration of ghrelin to tumor-bearing animals improved food intake, body weight, lean body mass, and chemotherapy-induced toxicity [51]. Both ghrelin and ghrelin analogues are currently being tested in clinical trials. Among these, anamorelin was recently shown to improve lean body mass, total body mass, and hand grip strength in patients affected by NSCLC [52]. Other studies, however, showed that anamorelin administration to cancer patients increased body weight and improved FAACT scores while did not enhance hand grip strength [53].",

Both decreased amino acid availability and insulin levels inhibit the anabolic pathway dependent on mTOR, resulting in downregulation of protein synthesis rates and stimulating protein degradation. Inhibition of mTOR signaling in cancer cachexia is enforced by proinflammatory cytokines [1]. Reduced amino acid uptake in the muscle was also reported to derive from altered amino acid transport. Indeed, in the soleus muscle of tumor-bearing rats, the activity of system A was decreased, while no changes were observed for systems L and ASC [54]. Of interest, TNF\u03b1 was shown to impair amino acid transport in tumor-bearing rats [55]. Plasma glutamine levels were shown to be significantly reduced in tumor-bearing rats with respect to healthy animals [56]. Of interest, reduced glutamine availability could activate the metabolic sensor adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK, see below; [57]). Finally, leucine oxidation was markedly increased in the muscle of rats bearing the Yoshida AH-130 hepatoma [58].

As for clinical studies, BCAA were proposed to improve anorexia [62], thus removing, partially at least, one of the mechanisms accounting for reduced amino acid uptake.

Such effect, however, could depend on the model system chosen, since HMB does not appear able to modulate muscle mass in mice bearing the C26 tumor (Costelli et al., unpublished observations). The situation is even more confused in human cachexia. Increase of both hemoglobin levels and fat-free mass were reported in advanced cancer patients administered a nutritional supplement containing HMB, arginine, and glutamine [65, 66].

In addition to proinflammatory mediators, also oxidative stress, due to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species levels exceeding the compensative capacity of the intracellular antioxidant systems, contributes to mitochondrial function impairment. In this regard, there are several studies sustaining the involvement of oxidative stress in cancer-induced muscle wasting, although a clear-cut causative evidence is still lacking [77] (Ballar\u00f2 et al., unpublished data; Figure 2).",

In particular, mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics as well as the disposal of damaged organelles, mainly by mitophagy, are promoted (Figure 2). The other way round, impaired function of the emergency routes themselves could trigger the accumulation of altered mitochondria resulting in reduced muscle oxidative metabolism. In this regard, the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism, was shown to be reduced in the skeletal muscle of tumor-bearing mice [78], although this is not a constant finding [73, 79]. Mitochondria dynamics, representing the balance between fission and fusion processes, was shown to be altered in both experimental cancer cachexia and in cancer patients [78, 80]. In this regard, impaired mitochondrial dynamics could drive the hyperactivation of muscle protein breakdown, likely through pathways depending on AMPK and FoxO, eventually leading to muscle wasting [81, 82].",

The first and perhaps simplest one, in theory at least, is exercise training, in particular a combination of both resistance and endurance exercise. These two types of training affect different but complementary targets, being able to improve force production and metabolic adaptations, respectively. Of particular relevance is the observation that endurance training was reported to increase the number of mitochondria and to drive myofiber-type shift from glycolytic to oxidative, thus specifically targeting alterations that characteristically occur in the skeletal muscle of tumor hosts. However, these potentially favorable effects can be exploited just systematically practicing exercise, even if at a moderate level. This may not be an easy task in cancer patients that frequently present with chronic fatigue and comorbidities eventually leading to exercise intolerance. This point is supported by the observation that C26-bearing mice did not benefit from exercise training, suggesting that the effort to exercise in already compromised animals was damaging rather than protective [73]. Consistently, excessive endurance exercise was associated with increased mitochondrial fission in the absence of mitophagy induction [83].",

SIRT1 is also involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis; its expression is induced in response to caloric restriction [97] and can be activated in the skeletal muscle by AMPK [98]. Specific overexpression of SIRT1 in the muscle resulted in a fast-to-slow myofiber type transition, producing an oxidative phenotype. Consistently, muscle-specific SIRT1 transgenic mice exposed to fasting or denervation showed a reduced expression of atrogenes in comparison with wild-type littermates [99]. Finally, improved muscle phenotype was reported in mdx/SIRT1 double transgenic mice [100]. In addition to AMPK, resveratrol also activates SIRT1. In this regard, part of the above-described effects exerted by resveratrol derive from SIRT1-dependent modulations of PGC-1\u03b1 acetylation state [101]. Synthetic selective SIRT1 activators such as SRT2104 are also available [102, 103]. Plasma lipid profile and insulin sensitivity were improved in healthy volunteers by administration of SRT2104 [102, 104]. Very few studies are actually available about SRT2104 action on both muscle mass and function. In this regard, SRT2104 appeared to reduce the depletion of muscle mass due to fasting or inactivity [105], at least in part by increasing PGC-1\u03b1 expression [105].",

Indeed, ATP synthesis through fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation requires more oxygen than glucose oxidation [106]. Along this line, the shift to glucose oxidation improves the use of the available oxygen, possibly increasing metabolic efficiency and skeletal muscle function. TMZ was shown to increase the size of cultured myotubes [107] and to improve both heart metabolism and exercise capacity in patients suffering from chronic stable angina [108]. When administered to aged animals, TMZ resulted in increased muscle strength [109]. Finally, treatment of C26-bearing mice with TMZ resembled some of the benefits triggered by exercise, among which fast-to-slow myofiber phenotype shift, PGC-1\u03b1 upregulation, oxidative metabolism enhancement, and grip strength increase (Molinari et al., unpublished). The relevance of fatty acid oxidation to cachexia is also supported by a recent study showing that several tumor cell lines are able to release proinflammatory mediators, resulting in enhanced fatty acid oxidation and activation of p38-dependent signaling in the skeletal muscle, well before tissue wasting occurs. In addition, the same study also showed that treatment of tumor-bearing animals with etomoxir, an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, rescued both muscle mass and body weight [110].",

In this regard, the view of a multidirectional approach, selectively tailored and, whenever possible, personalized, is gaining a growing consensus. Such an approach should not just rely on nutritional counseling and pharmacologic treatment with anti-inflammatory and anticatabolic drugs but also include exercise training and/or exercise-mimicking agents. In this regard, exercise mimetics could not only merely replace exercise training in depleted patients but also improve exercise tolerance and effectiveness in precachectic individuals, thus amplifying the beneficial action of exercise itself. Last but not least, treatments aimed at preventing/correcting the metabolic alterations underlying cancer-induced muscle wasting might also impinge on tumor-targeted therapies improving their effectiveness and/or enhancing patient tolerance to chemotherapy. In addition, metabolic modulators could also directly affect tumor growth. This is the case, for example, of exercise, that was shown to prevent or at least delay tumor growth [112].",
