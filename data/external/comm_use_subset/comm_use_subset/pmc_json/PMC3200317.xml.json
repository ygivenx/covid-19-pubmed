Case fatality rates of hospitalized patients suffering from arenaviral hemorrhagic fever (AHF) range from 15\u201330% [1], [2], [3], [4]. Arenaviruses known to cause AHF include Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabi\u00e1, and Chapare in the South American continent, and Lassa and Lujo in west and southern Africa, respectively. Primary transmission of the arenaviruses from respective rodent reservoir hosts to humans occurs via exposure to contaminated excreta [5]. Person-to-person transmission can occur through contact with blood or other body fluids during the care and management of infected individuals [1], [6]. Notably, these viruses are considered a threat to national security and are classified as highest priority pathogens by the NIAID [7].",

Off-label usage of ribavirin has been shown to be effective in treating Lassa fever when therapy was initiated within 6 days of the development of clinical symptoms. However, there are toxicities associated with ribavirin therapy at dosages required for efficacious use, which may contribute to the observed poor patient compliance in completing prescribed treatment regimens [10], [11]. Very limited case data using ribavirin to treat other AHFs supports the use of emergency protocols [1], [12], [13], however the utility of ribavirin therapy remains to be seen.",

Consensus (c)IFN-\u03b1, also known as IFN alfacon-1 and Infergen, is a licensed, second generation IFN-\u03b1 engineered to contain the most frequently occurring amino acids among the nonallelic IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. Previously, we have demonstrated that cIFN-\u03b1 can be used effectively alone, or in combination with ribavirin, to treat Pichind\u00e9 virus (PICV) infection in hamsters [15], [16], an experimental model of acute arenaviral disease [17]. However, while cIFN-\u03b1 has clinical value, its usefulness is hindered by its short half-life and cost to manufacture. There is an initial distributive half-life of 7 minutes and a beta half-life of 2 to 5 hours [14]. The rapid systemic clearance requires frequent dosing to achieve desired therapeutic levels. Consequently, treatment can result in well-documented toxicities which include headache, depression, hair loss, fever, and malaise. In order to combat the rapid degradation, PEGylated forms of recombinant IFN-\u03b1 have been introduced with half-lives that are on the order of days instead of hours, thus reducing the number of injections to once per week [18]. However, the cost to manufacture PEG-IFN-\u03b1 is exceedingly high, and the PEGylation process has been shown to reduce the activity of IFN-\u03b1, thereby further increasing the production costs.",

The absence of elevated ALT levels in the DEF201-treated hamsters may be explained by the 2\u20133 log10 reduction in liver virus burden (Figure 4E, F) and a delay in the development of liver disease. Although tissue titers were slightly lower when DEF201 was given 7 days prior to challenge compared to the 14 day pretreatment, this was not evident with serum viral burden. Because most animals had measurable replicating PICV (Figure 4C\u2013H), it is likely that survivors would have been immunized and protected from subsequent challenge.

The lack of significant antiviral activity elicited by the rAd EV control virus suggests that the enhanced antiviral response produced by DEF201 is largely due to the expression of the cIFN-\u03b1 gene. The weak stimulatory effect seen in 1 of the 3 experiments was not surprising considering the number of host systems that play a role in sensing the adenovirus vector [24]; however, the effect was short-lived. In contrast, the enhancement of the host antiviral defenses by DEF201 was long-lasting with a 14-day pre-PICV challenge prophylactic window. Moreover, DEF201 was effective when given 1\u20132 days post-PICV infection. These data also suggest that sufficient viral replication may be necessary to elicit an adaptive immune response that confers lasting protective immunity, as, for the most part, only re-challenged animals from the 24 h DEF201 pretreatment group succumbed to a second challenge with a lethal PICV inoculum. Presumably, the robust innate immunity and antiviral state induced by the DEF201 pretreatment rapidly controlled the \u223c5 pfu challenge dose obviating the development of the adaptive immune response and immunological memory.",

However, they appear to be unable to block the induction of IFN stimulated genes via exogenous type I IFN [29], which may, in part, explain the success of DEF201 and cIFN-\u03b1 treatments [15]. Also essential to the success of DEF201 was early intervention prior to significant viral replication and engagement of innate immune suppressive functions. Indeed, early induction of a strong type I IFN response is associated with favorable disease outcome in nonhuman primates challenged with Lassa virus [30]. Early post-exposure prophylaxis was also required with exogenous cIFN-\u03b1 protein administered by the i.p. route [15], [16]. With the multiple strategies that arena and other pathogenic viruses have in place to subdue the IFN-mediated host antiviral response [31], the utility of DEF201, recombinant IFN proteins, and IFN inducing agents will depend upon the nature of the IFN pathway blockade and require early administration to be effective post-exposure.",

In contrast, DEF201 consistently elicited greater protection (90\u2013100%). The improved efficacy observed with DEF201 may be explained by a combination of factors that includes constitutive expression of fully glycosylated protein and reduced animal stress levels by avoiding daily injections for 7\u201310 days. We hypothesize that with the appropriate dose of DEF201, therapeutic levels of consensus IFN-\u03b1 can be maintained, effectively eliminating the daily bolus effect produced by i.p. injections. In addition, because cIFN-\u03b1 is produced in genetically engineered Escherichia coli, the native glycosylation pattern is lost. Conceivably, enhanced immunotherapeutic activity results from fully glycosylated cIFN-\u03b1 expressed from cells transduced with DEF201.",

More recently, in a different hamster model of viral hemorrhagic fever, several of us reported on efficacy of DEF201 in mitigating YFV infection and disease [19]. YFV infection appears to be more sensitive to the effects of DEF201, as a lower dose was able to provide complete protection. Taken together with the results of the present study, the experimental animal data support the broad use of DEF201 for extended pre-exposure and early post-exposure prophylaxis applications. Further investigations using advanced arenavirus models based on challenge of nonhuman primates with pathogenic arenaviruses [17] are needed to better evaluate the potential of DEF201 to prevent severe disease in humans. Nonhuman primate models should allow the full spectrum of cIFN-\u03b1 activity not possible in hamsters or guinea pigs.",

An important step in the development process is the safety/toxicology testing in rodents, which is presently underway. In our studies, the highest dose of 108 pfu of DEF201 administered by the i.n. route appeared to be well-tolerated in hamsters despite evidence of weight loss. They did not appear visibly ill, but clearly the treatment was having some effect that possibly led to reduced food and water consumption consistent with mild toxicity seen with IFN-\u03b1 therapy. The i.n. delivery route is designed to circumvent pre-existing immunity to adenovirus type 5 in humans [21], [34], and may limit systemic inflammation that could occur by parenteral administration of large numbers of adenovirus particles. Ultimately, the production of a shelf-stable, powdered formulation of DEF201 for easy i.n. administration and long-term storage would be ideal for stock-piling in the event of the need for mass distribution due to intentional release or (re)emerging disease outbreaks of arena or other viral etiology.",
