The presence of PP in DRAG mice, in contrast to other humanized mice, allowed us to characterize the lymphocytes in this tissue. Human cells were identified by the expression of human hematopoietic cell marker CD45 (Fig. 1a left panel, representative dot plot). All lymphoid and mucosal tissues investigated were reconstituted with human cells (Fig. 1a left panel, Fig. 1b, average percentage with standard error of mean from 5-8 separate experiments, and Supplementary Fig. 1a, representative dot plot). Furthermore, the reconstitution of human cells in the gut of DRAG mice was high, compared to other humanized mouse strains23. The frequency of T cells was 60\u201385% of the human CD45+ cells (Fig. 1c), while B cells constituted 10-35% of human CD45+cells (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2). There were no significant differences in the frequency of CD4+ T cells among the various tissues investigated (Fig. 1e). Among T cells, the percentage of CD4+ T cells was much higher than CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1a second panel and Fig. 1e), which is similar to what has been observed in humans. A subpopulation of T cells that expresses both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors (CD4+CD8+ or double positive) were mainly present in LPL (about 20%) and IEL (15.8%), and also in the PP (7%), SP (6%), FRT (5.3%), and LN (6%), albeit at a lower frequency (Fig. 1a second panel, Fig. 1e, and Supplementary Fig. 1a). The frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells in LPL and IEL was significantly higher compared to SP and LN (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively).",

The majority of CD4+ T cells (79\u201396%) exhibited a memory phenotype, which is defined as negative for the na\u00efve CD4+ T cell marker CD45RA (Fig. 1a third panel). The majority of memory CD4+ T cells in LPL (Fig. 1a third panel) and FRT (Supplementary Fig. 1a) were negative for CD27 and CD45RA thus exhibiting an effector memory phenotype. In contrast, the majority of memory CD4+ T cells in IEL, PP, and SP (Fig. 1a third panel) displayed a central memory phenotype by expressing CD27 but not CD45RA. Since the coreceptor CCR5 is required for R5 HIV-1 strains2425, we examined its expression on CD4+ T cells. The majority of CD4+ T cells in FRT, IEL, LPL, and PP expressed CCR5 (50\u201380%) compared to SP (25%), and LN (40%) (Fig. 1a fourth panel, Fig. 1f, and Supplementary Fig. 1a).

While the majority of CXCR5+PD-1++ (red histogram) and CXCR5\u2212PD-1++ (green histogram) CD4+ T cells expressed ICOS, a small proportion of CXCR5+PD-1+ cells (orange histogram) also displayed this receptor on their surface (Fig. 4b).

We found that CXCR5+PD-1++ CD4+ T cells also expressed high levels of BCL-6 with CXCR5+PD-1+ CD4+ T cells expressing intermediate levels of BCL-6 (Fig. 4c). These results indicate that the CXCR5+PD-1++ CD4+ T cells are TFH cells while the CXCR5+PD-1+ CD4+ T cells are likely to be precursor TFH (pre- TFH) cells.",

To investigate the ability of TFH cells to activate memory B cells, we sorted CXCR5+PD-1+ and CXCR5+PD-1++ CD4+ T cells from FRT and LPL of humanized DRAG mice. In parallel, we sorted autologous memory B cells from the same tissues (Supplementary Fig. 3) and incubated them with sorted CXCR5+PD-1++ or CXCR5+PD-1+ CD4+ T cells. After stimulation with PMA and ionomycin, cells were stained for CXCR3 and for intracellular IL-21 and IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 4d). Our data show that in both FRT and LPL, IL-21 and IFN-\u03b3 were mainly expressed by CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells, which were either CXCR5+PD-1++ or CXCR5+PD-1+. However, the proportion of intracellular IL-21+ cells was low in PD-1++ CXCR3\u2212 and PD-1+CXCR3\u2212 CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4d). The presence of TFH cells in the FRT of humanized DRAG mice was unexpected, therefore, to confirm the presence of TFH cells in human FRT, we obtained cervical tissue from routine hysterectomy and extracted the endocervix and ectocervix. The ecto- and endocervix were treated with collagenase to obtain the cellular fractions and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The endo- and ectocervix contained approximately 1\u20133% CXCR5+ PD-1++CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4e). The majority of these cells (about 72%) expressed BCL-6 confirming the presence of human TFH cells (Fig. 4e) in human FRT.",

After culture, cells were stained and analyzed as mentioned above. Uninfected LPL are shown in Fig. 6a first row. CXCR5+PD-1++ CD4+ T cells were the most susceptible to HIV-1 infection (81%) compared to other subsets (Fig. 6a, second row, far right panel). Other CD4+ T cell subsets, CXCR5\u2212PD-1+, CXCR5\u2212PD-1++, CXCR5+PD-1\u2212, and CXCR5+PD-1+ cells were also infected albeit at a lower frequency (36\u201355%) (Fig. 6a, second row). The CXCR5\u2212PD-1\u2212 CD4+ T cells appeared to be more resistant to infection (Fig. 6a, second row, far left panel). The fraction of cells expressing CXCR3 was the largest among CXCR5+ PD-1++ CD4+ T cells (Fig. 6a, third row, far right panel), and intermediate among the other subsets, except for CXCR5\u2212PD-1\u2212 cells, which displayed low expression of this receptor on the surface (Fig. 6a third row far left panel). The expression of CCR5 was high in the gut and FRT CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). Among CD4+ T cell subsets, CXCR5+PD-1++ and CXCR5\u2212PD-1++ cells predominantly expressed CCR5 (65-76%), while CXCR5\u2212PD-1+, CXCR5+PD-1\u2212 and CXCR5+PD-1+ cells were intermediate for CCR5 expression (Fig. 6a fourth row). CCR5 receptor was detectable on a small subset (4%) of CXCR5\u2212PD-1\u2212 CD4+ T cells. We also found a strong correlation between CCR5 and CXCR3 expression (Fig. 6b left panel; P = 0.008 R = 0.93). Similarly, there was a strong correlation between HIV-1 infectivity (p24), CXCR3 (Fig. 6b middle panel; P = 0.003, R = 0.95) and CCR5 expression (Fig. 6b right panel; P = 0.02, R = 0.90). These results suggest that HIV-1 infectivity is correlated with CCR5 and CXCR3 expression on TFH cells. To confirm that HIV-1 infection for 3 days did not contribute to the upregulation of PD-1 on CD4+ T cells, we sorted LPL cells from uninfected HIV-1 humanized DRAG mice using a BD FACS Aria cell sorter (Supplementary Figure 4). The sorted hCD45+CD4+CXCR5-PD\u22121\u2212 cells were then infected in duplicate with primary HIV-1 as described in the Methods Section, washed, and then cultured for three days. We found that 7% (Supplementary Figure 4B, upper panel) and 10% (Supplementary Figure 4B, lower panel) of the cells were infected and remained negative for PD-1 expression. Based on these data, we conclude that HIV-1 infection does not upregulate the expression of PD-1 in the first 3 days of infection.",

HIV-1 RNA was detected in the blood as early as 7 days after intravaginal challenge with the viral load steadily increasing up to day 21 (Fig. 7a). The viral load peaked on day 21 (5.3 \u00d7 105 copies ml\u22121) and did not vary significantly thereafter (Fig. 7a). Mice were analyzed at various time points post infection to determine the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells. When the mice were analyzed at 20 days post-infection (the first detectable copies of HIV-1 RNA were seen on day 13), the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells was above 1 in all tissues (Fig. 7b, upper panels). When the mice were analyzed at 42 days post-infection, the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ T cells was below 1 (Fig. 7b, lower panels) and this ratio continued to decrease as the infection progressed. Mice euthanized at the end of the study, showed a large depletion not only in CD4+ T cells but also in CD8+ T and B cells in the mucosal tissues (data not shown). The decrease in CD8+ T and B cells has also been reported in the gut tissues of HIV-1 infected BLT mice36.",

This allowed us to study mucosal CD4+ T cells before and after HIV-1 infection in the gut and FRT with special emphasis on TFH cells. CD4+ T cells from all three tissues expressed varying levels of HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5, CXCR4, and \u03b14\u03b27. Mucosal tissues are the primary sites of HIV-1 transmission. The binding of the gut homing receptor \u03b14\u03b27 to gp120 potentially facilitates HIV-1 infection of mucosal CD4+ T cells272837. Our study demonstrates a high frequency of \u03b14\u03b27+ and CCR5+ CD4+ T cell memory phenotype in LPL, IEL, and FRT, which likely increased their susceptibility to HIV-1. Furthermore, the expression of \u03b14\u03b27 and CCR5 was not restricted to CD4+ T cells but was also seen at much higher levels on CD4+CD8+ T cells, which has not been previously reported. The high expression of CCR5 and \u03b14\u03b27 on IEL and LPL CD4+CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells, suggests that the CD4+CD8+ T cells are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection. In fact, our study shows that acquisition of HIV-1 by CD4+CD8+ T cells was greater than CD4+ (single positive) T cells obtained from the same tissue. Since the distribution and the frequency of memory phenotype were similar in CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD8+ T cells, this indicates that in addition to their memory phenotype, the high expression of HIV-1 coreceptors also plays a crucial role in HIV-1 acquisition. It has been shown that CD4+CD8+ T cells are highly susceptible to SIV in the gut38 and HIV in the periphery39. It has been demonstrated that CD4+CD8+ T cells are higher in the gut of healthy individuals and animals than in lymphoid organs40414243444546 indicating that our findings in the gut of humanized DRAG mice are consistent with published data in humans. We are currently investigating the function of CD4+CD8+ T cells in relation to HIV-1 infection.",

However in the chronic phase, although TFH cells have increased in number, their support for B cells is largely diminished due to exhaustion of CXCR5+PD-1++ TFH cells3147484950. The molecular basis for the exhaustion of TFH cells has not been fully understood. It has been reported that CXCR5+PD-1++ TFH cells have a high content of HIV-1 DNA and express the cell division marker Ki-6710. Therefore, the increase in the number of CXCR5+PD-1++ TFH cells is probably due to the activation caused by HIV-1 infection, which leads to their proliferation. It has also been shown that blocking PD-1-PDL interaction in vitro partially restored anti-HIV-1 antibody production3151. Similarly, in the SIV model, CXCR5+PD-1++ TFH cell exhaustion was related to excessive signaling of PD-1, while disruption of PD-1-PDL interaction increased SIV-specific antibody responses5253.",

Although, the role of TFH cells in the LN and in the blood of HIV-1 infected individuals has been explored10121431, their contribution to HIV-1 infection in the gut mucosal tissues has not been investigated despite the fact that the gut and FRT are the initial sites of HIV entry and early pathogenesis. While the human endocervix and uterus have been shown to contain organized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and large lymphoid aggregates, which are similar to gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)181920, the presence of TFH cells in FRT has not been previously described. In our study, we identified TFH cells and pre-TFH cells in the FRT and gut of humanized DRAG mice. After HIV-1 infection, the frequency of TFH cells in FRT and PP increased. We also confirmed the presence of TFH cells in human cervical tissue. The identification of TFH cells in the FRT may therefore contribute to the early seeding of HIV-1 infection.",

Our data show that the frequency of CXCR3+ cells was highest among the mucosal CXCR5+PD-1++ TFH cells compared to the other CD4+ T cell fractions in the gut of humanized DRAG mice. These cells were also the most permissive to HIV-1 infection and are the main source of IL-21 after in vitro stimulation in contrast to CXCR3\u2212 TFH cells. Our data are consistent with the findings of Bentebibel et al, who demonstrated that CXCR3+ peripheral TFH cells were the main source of IL-2111. In contrast, two other studies have shown either CXCR3\u2212 peripheral TFH cells or both CXCR3\u2212 peripheral TFH cells and CXCR3+ peripheral TFH cells as the main source of IL-211332. Our results clearly demonstrate that the CXCR3+CXCR5+PD1++CD4+ T cells express BCL-6 and are thus TFH cells.",

Our data show that DRAG mice are highly susceptible to intravaginal infection with HIV-1. A single low dose intravaginal inoculation with primary HIV-1 (2.54 ng p24) was sufficient to infect 100% of humanized DRAG mice. Therefore the high susceptibility of humanized DRAG mice to HIV-1 infection after intravaginal inoculation is likely related to (i) the high reconstitution of human cells in the female reproductive tract; (ii) the dominance of CD4+ T cell memory phenotype in gut tissues and FRT, (iii) the high levels of expression of HIV-1 coreceptors, and (iv) the accumulation of TFH cells in the gut and FRT. Thus, the humanized DRAG mice represent a suitable model to investigate HIV-1 pathogenesis and opens new opportunities to use this mouse model to study TFH cells in the gut and FRT and to evaluate the efficacy of potential candidate HIV-1 vaccines.",
