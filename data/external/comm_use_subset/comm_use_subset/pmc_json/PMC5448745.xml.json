            "text": "Human rhinovirus (HRV), a non-segmented positive sense RNA from Picornaviridae, [1], is the most prevalent human respiratory pathogen [2], consisted of three species, HRV-A, B and C [3]. HRV is associated with common colds and concomitant sinusitis [4] and otitis media episodes [5] as well as lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [6]. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia among young children, exacerbations of asthma in older children, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia in older age are the predominant features associated with HRV at different age groups [7,8]. Association of HRV with LRTIs has also been demonstrated in lower airway samples [9,10]. Human airway epithelial cell is the primary target for HRV infection leading to interstitial pneumonia [11,12]. An emerging body of evidence indicates that asthma exacerbations and COPD triggered by HRV alterations of pulmonary epithelial cells and subsequent airway inflammation rather than direct cytotoxicity on the cells [13,14].",

Although clinico-epidemiological studies have revealed specific features associated with HRV species [18,19], the transcriptomic data is rather limited and have not been extensively understood with respect to different species [20]. In the current study we hypothesized that HRV-B infection could deregulate expression of genes in a timely manner with potential to introduce novel targets attributed to species B for further investigations. To address this hypothesis, we performed gene expression analysis of the RNA samples obtained from alveolar epithelial cells infected with of HRV-B using Affymetrix Genechip technology. Our study reveals comprehensive gene expression profile of epithelial cell response to HRV-B infection across different time points in vitro. We have demonstrated remarkable gene expression changes in each time points post infection including novel virus-induced genes. Collectively, our data provides novel targets for further evaluation and to develop efficient anti-HRV therapeutic strategies.",

Stocks of HRV72 were propagated in H1Hela cells. H1Hela monolayer cells at 80% confluency were inoculated with HRV72 and virus absorption was carried out for 1.5 hours with gentle shaking. The cells were nourished with fresh media with 2% FBS and incubated at 34\u00b0C. The cell culture flasks were monitored daily and when HRV typical CPE covered more than 50% of the cells, they were harvested after three freeze-thaw cycles to rupture the membranes followed by centrifugation to pellet cell debris and stored at -80\u00b0C. Then the crude virus was concentrated using ultracentrifugation at 48k rpm for 2 hours using OptiSeal Polypropylene Tubes (optima L-100XP ultracentrifuge; Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The suspended impure virus was subjected to sucrose gradient using Beckman SW41 rotor to remove exogenous proteins and contaminants. The sucrose fractions were collected by peristaltic pump and analyzed using SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE analysis of sucrose fractions revealed that pure virus was present in high concentration at UP6 fraction as evident by the presence of three distinct bands corresponding to VP1-3 capsid proteins (S1 Fig). The fractions containing concentrated intact virus were dialyzed using 3500 MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis cassettes G2 (3.5 ml) and subsequently followed by concentration step using concentrator 9K MWCO (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and aliquots were stored at -80\u00b0C.",

To achieve reproducible results, 100 ng of input RNA with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of minimum 7.0 was applied as a standard amount for first-strand cDNA synthesis (at 42\u00b0C for 2 hours) primed with a T7-oligo (dT) primer using GeneChip 3\u2019 IVT Express kit (P/N 901228, Affymetrix, USA). Second-strand cDNA was subsequently synthesized using DNA polymerase and RNase H (at 16\u00b0C for 1 hour). Linear RNA amplification using T7 transcription technology was employed in this kit. In the next step, the double-stranded cDNA was used as a template to amplify biotin-modified RNA (amplified RNA or aRNA). The aRNA was purified and concentration and purity was measured by using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer. To achieve optimal sensitivity of the assay, the labelled aRNA was fragmented to a mean size of 200 bases at 94\u00b0C and for 35 minutes before hybridization on gene chip array.

Bhd., Malaysia, using GenChip Hybridization, Wash, and Stain Kit (P/N 900720), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Hybridization cocktail composed of 10 \u03bcg of fragmented aRNA and hybridization controls was hybridized to the GeneChip at 45\u00b0C for 16 hours and 60 rpm rotation in hybridization oven. Then the arrays were washed and stained in GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 prior to scanning with GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).",

CEL files were normalized to remove effects related to systematic variations. Summarized expression values (CHP files) were created using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA) summarization algorithm [25] implemented in Affymetrix Expression Console Software 1.3 (available at: https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis/microarray-analysis-instruments-software-services/microarray-analysis-software.html). RMA workflow is based on quantile normalization of probe level signal intensities and has a general background correction to reduce interarray variability. The constructed CHP files were used for evaluation of individual hybridization success (QC control) and identification of outlier sample using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in Affymetrix Expression Console Software 1.3. The quality of the starting RNA samples were evaluated using internal control housekeeping genes (GAPDH and ACTB). Entire target labelling process was monitored by adding four exogenous, premixed control spikes: lys, phe, thr, and dap. Efficiency of sample hybridization on the array was assessed by hybridization controls (bio B, bio C, bio D, and cre). QC analysis using Expression Console software showed that all the samples were located within threshold boundaries. The RNA samples hybridized to the array had RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 7 or greater. The 3\u2032/5\u2032 ratios of internal control probe sets including GAPDH and ACTB were less than 3 for all the arrays indicating appropriate sample quality [26]. The signal value profile was as expected with correct relative abundance for each of the spikes for both target labelling and sample hybridization indicating acceptable hybridization process. Normalized and log2 transformed data were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and to construct heat-map dendrogram and hierarchical clustering in virus-infected, as compared to the mock-infected cells using Transcriptome Analysis Console v2.0 (available at: https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis/microarray-analysis-instruments-software-services/microarray-analysis-software.html). The data was filtered to select DEGs using a p-value of 0.05 and less with a \u22651.5-fold or \u2264-1.5-fold cut-off.

            "text": "It is of great importance to note that in first three time points of HRV infection, the expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6; type II DUSP subgroup) was up-regulated by 2.86, 2.12 and 1.50 fold at 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively while the expression of DUSP22 (type I DUSP subgroup) was down-regulated at 6 hpi (-1.57 fold). Analysis showed that other signal transduction related genes were found to be significantly affected including GNB4, SOCS3, SOCS2, and PREX1 (Fig 4D). Early growth response 1 (EGR1) was the most strongly up-regulated gene across all the time points (25, 5, 1.5 fold at 12, 24 and 48 hpi, respectively). In addition to EGR1, a cluster of other transcription factors including FOS-like antigen 1 (FOSL1; 3.13 fold at 6hpi; 1.88 fold at 12hpi; 1.57 fold at 24hpi), FOS-like antigen 2 (FOSL2; 1.51 fold at 6hpi), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS; 2.94 fold at 12hpi), jun proto-oncogene (JUN; 3.45 at 12hpi; 1.66 at 24hpi), v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog F (avian) (MAFF; 2.89 at 6hpi; 1.96 at 24hpi) and ETS-domain protein (SRF accessory protein 2) (ELK3; 1.97 fold at 6 and 1.52 fold 12 hpi) were elevated also they dominated at 6, 12, and 24 hpi (Fig 4C). Collectively these data suggest that, the significant induction of chemokines preferentially at early stage could be an indication of characteristic viral infection. The prominent regulation of the apoptosis related genes together with inflammatory chemokines at early stage of infection may indicate that many important events related to the virus pathogenicity had happened during early phase of infection. Understanding the cell signaling profiles driven by DE genes can be an indication of interaction between virus and host-cell as well as prediction of cell fate.",

We hypothesized that a discrete gene subsets could be disrupted along with development of infection. Undifferentiated epithelial cell culture model was selected in order to increase susceptibility of the cells to virus in order to reach uniform infection [27]. The advantage of this system allows analysis of data mainly among infected cells rather than uninfected cells. Although replication of the rhinovirus can be low grade with non-cytopathic effect [28], in the current study HRV72 infection was determined by progression of characteristic CPE which was accompanied by efficient intracellular (cell lysate) and extracellular (cell culture supernatant) accumulation of the viral genome. This finding further provides an in vitro evidence for implication of HRV-B in LRTI [11,28]. The transcriptional response to HRV infection was characterized by significant up- and down-regulation of the genes. The prominent down-regulation of the genes and low induction of antiviral genes could be related to the cleavage of transcriptional factors observed in Picornaviruses [29].",

The potential role of respiratory viruses for induction of airway inflammation has been demonstrated for HRV [16] as well as other viruses [30]. The induction of chemotactic factors in this study suggests a potential role of the HRV72 infected alveolar epithelial cells to initiate pulmonary inflammation, the possible role that has been demonstrated for primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells infected with HRV-A strains [15,17]. In addition, strain-specific differences has been reported among influenza viruses regarding the infectivity grade and inflammatory response [31]. The current study showed that HRV72 induced expression of CXC (ELR-CXC) and CC chemokines and further suggests that neutrophilic and non-neutrophilic arms of the immune response could be activated upon HRV72 infection. Indeed uncontrolled expression of the chemokines can eventually lead to pathological inflammatory reactions.",

The induction of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA and activation of Jak/STAT pathway was not also reported for HRV 14 [20,38]. It has been shown that IRF3 acts as an intermediate molecule to stimulate the induction of IFN-I and variety of ISGs in airway epithelial cells infected with HRV group A [39]. Low level of the IFN-I in the study by Kotla et l. (2008) [38] could be explained by the impaired activation of the IRF3 in the presence of the activated NF-\u03baB and ATF-2. Variable grades of IFN type I induction in the strain-specific differences manner have been shown among influenza viruses and host antiviral which could play a critical role in clinical disease [31,40]. The discrepancy in the induction or inhibition of IFN-I observed in HRV infections is not clear and could be different between primary and immortalized cells as well as different virus serotypes. This finding further emphasizes the important implication of developing IFN based treatment for HRV-B infections. Defective induction of major antiviral genes could be primarily related to the defective induction of IFN genes. HRV72 induced expression of tripartite motif containing (TRIM 10, 68, 26, and 69) genes, which play a broad role in innate immune response. The positive regulatory effect versus negative regulatory effect of TRIM proteins on antiviral response has been reported in other viruses and it is noteworthy to investigate the effect of TRIMs found in this study on HRV infection [41].",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved strategies to exploit cell signaling pathways for virus replication. Targeting of these pathways might be a valuable antiviral approach [42]. MAPK signaling pathways play critical role in innate and adaptive immune response. Association of MAPK activation to the production of chemokines and cytokines has been shown in influenza infection[42]. Inactivation of MAPK pathways through DUSP also plays an important role in immune system[43]. Interestingly, DUSP6 was induced at first three time points in our study. Understanding the role of DUSP6 in MAPKs regulation in the context of HRV infection may require further investigations. Activation of signal transduction pathways could result in activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and NF-\u03baB. HRV72 induced expression of FOSL1, FOSL2, FOS and JUN genes. Combinations of the Fos and Jun proteins constitute dimeric transcription factor called AP-1. The AP-1 mediated production of chemokies has been demonstrated by Hoffmann et al. [44] who delineated different roles for Fra-1 and c-Fos in transcription of IL8. Cooperative role of AP-1 in conjugation with NF-\u03baB in IL8 induction has been shown for RSV[45]. More research on this topic including protein level expression as well as determination of absolute or cooperative interaction of AP-1 with other transcription factors in stimulation of chemokines could be useful for the develop of combinatorial therapy for HRV infection. Surprisingly EGR-1 was the DE gene expressed at the highest level in this study. Previous study reveal that HSV-1 viral load and subsequent mortality is reduced in EGR-1 knockout mice suggestive of EGR-1 role in regulation of virus replication [46]. Further investigations would address the association between EGR-1 and HRV72 replication.",

The previous studies of apoptotic pathways indicated that different HRV strains can activate both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways through caspase 9 [47] and caspase 8, respectively [48]. BCL2A and MCL1 belonged to the anti-apoptotic regulators of Bcl-2 family [49] were significantly induced in response to HRV infection. The cytoprotective effect of over-expressed BCL2A and MCL1 genes played critical role in neutrophil survival [50] and inhibited oxidant-induced necrosis and apoptosis in lung epithelial cells[51]. The induction of BCL2A1 and MCL-1 may be causing higher cell viability despite incomplete preservation of cell morphology and development of CPE in the current study. Over-expressed Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl in Coxsackievirus B3 infected cells preserved high cell viability and inhibited release of Cyt c from mitochondria [52]. From a translational point of view, in depth understanding of pro/anti-apoptotic pathways regulated by the virus could lead to the development of novel therapeutics against HRV.",

The relative role of the immune factors in clearing versus pathology of the virus may also have like to patient underlying condition.
