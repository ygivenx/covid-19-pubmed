Both influenza and SARS exhibit seasonality, with increased incidence during wintertime in temperate regions and perhaps during the rainy season in tropical regions (4\u201310). Understanding infectious disease transmission is a complex problem due to the many factors involved, such as environmental conditions, human activity (e.g., more crowding in buildings during wintertime), hygiene, and host susceptibility. Environmental conditions are particularly compelling to examine when considering seasonality due to clear changes in weather throughout the year in temperate regions.",

The first studies of the effect of RH on influenza virus survival emerged in the 1940s (19, 20), and more followed (21\u201324). The results indicated either a monotonically decreasing relationship between virus survival and humidity (i.e., lower survival at high humidity) or a \u201cU-shaped\u201d relationship with reduced survival at mid-range humidities. Two studies described similar relationships for the SARS coronavirus and its surrogates (25, 26). The seemingly conflicting results may be due to the use of different media for virus suspensions (13).",

AH describes the mass of water vapor per volume of air (i.e., the concentration of water vapor in air), while RH describes the ratio of the actual concentration of water vapor to the maximum possible concentration, which varies strongly with temperature. Shaman and Kohn (12) have concluded that the relationship is stronger with AH than with RH. According to their analysis of virus survival in aerosols (24) and transmission in guinea pigs (16), AH explains 50% and 90% of the variability in influenza virus transmission and survival, respectively, whereas RH explains only 12% and 36%, respectively, of the variability. In a study examining influenza virus survival in droplets at elevated temperatures (55 to 65\u00b0C), McDevitt et al. (27) also reported that AH is a better predictor than RH for virus inactivation. Shaman et al. (15) have modeled influenza-related mortality and suggested that changes in AH alone are the root cause of seasonal trends, whereas RH is a poor predictor. A causality analysis of global flu incidence data has shown that AH is a stronger driver than RH (18).",

The relationship between survival and humidity is confounded by the fact that higher values of AH can only be achieved at higher temperatures, which are known to accelerate virus inactivation (28). Epidemiological studies involving humidity have necessarily relied on data from outdoor weather stations, but almost all transmission probably takes place indoors, where people spend 90% of their time (29). Indoor RH is very strongly correlated with outdoor AH during the winter heating season (30), so we cannot yet rule out RH as a predictor for influenza incidence. Finally, we have proposed a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between virus survival with RH that revolves around the extent of evaporation and the resulting increase in solute concentrations in droplets (13), but we are not able to identify one for AH.",

We exposed an enveloped virus to seven environmentally relevant RHs and four temperatures to test the hypothesis that RH is more important than AH in modulating virus infectivity. Additionally, we hypothesize that over the range of temperatures typically found indoors (19 to 25\u00b0C), temperature does not have a significant effect on infectivity. The resulting data set is larger than has been obtained previously and enables a robust analysis that goes beyond simple linear regression. Due to the challenges and biosafety concerns of working with the influenza virus and coronavirus, this study employed the enveloped bacteriophage Phi6, which has been suggested as a surrogate for the influenza virus (31, 32) and SARS coronavirus (33). Our results provide novel information about the complex interplay between temperature, humidity, and the survival of viruses in droplets. This methodology may serve as a model for future efforts to study viruses that require more stringent biosafety protocols and to assess whether the results shown here are generalizable to other viruses.",

As shown in Fig. 1, virus infectivity, defined as the ratio of the concentration of PFU derived from the exposed droplets to the concentration of PFU in a control, depended on both RH and temperature. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of all data points showed there was a significant (P = 0.0002) influence of temperature on Phi6 infectivity; however, at 14\u00b0C and 19\u00b0C, virus infectivity remained high across all RHs tested. There was a significant effect of RH (P < 0.0001) on Phi6 infectivity at each temperature tested, except at 19\u00b0C (P = 0.0528). At 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, we observed the same U-shaped RH dependence that Yang et al. (13) reported for influenza A virus in medium containing very little protein or none at all. At 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, Phi6 infectivity was highest at RHs of less than \u223c60% and greater than 85%. At 37\u00b0C and between \u223c60% and 85% RH, there was an \u223c6-log reduction in infectivity. At 25\u00b0C, the relative infectious ratio was 3 log lower at 75% RH than at 98% RH. For comparison, at 37\u00b0C, there were \u223c6-log and \u223c2-log losses in Phi6 infectivity at 75% and 98% RH, respectively, a difference in infectivity of 4 log even though there was only an \u223c20-point difference in RH. To put these numbers into broader perspective, most environmental health and safety programs consider biological disinfection to occur when there is a 4- to 5-log reduction in starting microbial concentrations.",

This study was designed specifically to compare the importance of RH, AH, and temperature as predictors of enveloped virus survival in droplets. Ultimately, we hope this work can help explain the trends in diseases caused by enveloped viruses and lead to improved disease control strategies. Our results suggest that in determining virus infectivity, the interaction among RH, AH, and temperature is complex and not easily captured by linear or log-linear regressions. Shaman and Kohn (12) found that AH was more important than RH in determining virus survivability, but they only evaluated each variable singly. The comparison is confounded by temperature, because higher values of AH are only achievable at higher temperatures, and virus infectivity is reduced at higher temperatures regardless of humidity. Additionally, their data set only contained 11 RH/AH/temperature combinations, compared to 28 combinations in our study.",

The log-linear regression performed better but found that both RH and AH together were important in predicting infectivity. The random forest model fit the data best of all the approaches used (R2 = 0.83). The random forest model suggested that RH was the most important factor in controlling Phi6 infectivity in droplets. Random forests have the advantage that they do not need a prespecified model to evaluate as regressions do. Random forests develop the model based on the data and can thus provide improved results for models based on correlated interacting variables (34). They also directly supply a variable importance. These findings suggest that going forward, researchers need to take care in choosing the most appropriate model for statistical analyses when working with colinear data sets, as the model chosen can lead to different conclusions even when working with the same experimental data.",

We previously proposed a mechanistic explanation for the relationship between influenza survival in droplets and RH, with partial evaporation and subsequent concentration of solutes explaining some of the results observed (13). Briefly, when virus is released into the environment as part of a respiratory fluid droplet, RH, not AH, controls how much water evaporates from the droplet until it reaches equilibrium with the surrounding air, as described by the Kohler equation. The amount of water lost affects salt and protein concentrations, and potentially pH, in the droplet, and changes in these properties could affect virus survival, although more work is needed to understand these effects on a physiological level.",

Larger droplets can take a long time to evaporate, especially at high humidity, while very small droplets are able to evaporate in milliseconds (37). One potential explanation for why we observed a significant effect of temperature on virus infectivity at high humidities (>60%) and not lower humidities (Fig. 1) is because at lower humidities, the droplets evaporated and the virus was potentially in a \u201cdesiccated\u201d state that was unaffected by changes in temperature. It is well known that other biological materials (e.g., bacterial spores, fungal spores, and nematodes) are able to survive in a desiccated state, and in fact, desiccation is used for the long-term preservation of microbial samples (38, 39). Greiff and Rightsel (40) showed that removing the residual moisture from influenza virus to \u223c2% enabled the virus to maintain its titer level for 13 to 20 days at 28\u00b0C and 2.5 to 3.5 days at 45\u00b0C. However, \u201coverdrying\u201d and removing too much moisture produced a less protective effect; when dried to a residual moisture of 0.4%, the influenza titer was only maintained for 2 days at 28\u00b0C. In our study, at higher humidities (>60%), the droplets remained wet, and thus virus infectivity was potentially affected by both temperature-mediated exponential decay as defined by the Arrhenius equation and changes in droplet chemistry due to the partial evaporation of water. We speculate that at a very high humidity (>85%), virus decay is modulated by temperature changes (since the droplet is at near-physiological conditions), while at a mid-range RH (60 to 85%), virus decay is due to changes in droplet chemistry due to evaporation. A full mechanistic explanation may be revealed by future research examining the chemistry of evaporating droplets and the physiological effect on virus.",

Over this range, virus infectivity decreases exponentially with increasing temperatures (Fig. 3).

            "text": "There are some potential limitations to this study. First, to overcome some of the challenges and technical limitations of working with human pathogens, previous research has suggested that bacteriophage Phi6 is an appropriate surrogate for infectious enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza, and SARS) (31\u201333). The advantages of working with Phi6 include its biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) biohazard rating, the ability to rapidly and accurately quantify virus infectivity through plaque assays, and its extensive characterization. Phi6, influenza, and coronaviruses are all lipid-enveloped RNA viruses that are \u223c100 nm in diameter. One important molecular difference is that Phi6 contains double-stranded RNA, while influenza and coronaviruses contain single-stranded RNA. It is unlikely, but possible, that this molecular difference could lead to differences in infectivity as a function of environmental conditions; however, this requires future research. Researchers recently evaluated the suitability of Phi6 as a universal surrogate and cautioned that it might not be an appropriate surrogate for all enveloped viruses in all environments (46). Whereas only 1 to 10% of influenza virus particles are infectious (47, 48), nearly all bacteriophage particles are thought to be infectious, and so infectivity may be much more labile for influenza virus than for the surrogate. As this study focuses on the patterns in decay as a function of temperature and humidity rather than the absolute value of decay, differences in lability are hopefully minimized. Additionally, one might argue that droplets are not representative of aerosols, but we have observed similar results for Phi6 infectivity versus RH in both stationary droplets and suspended aerosols (Fig. 5). Finally, Phi6 was suspended in tryptic soy broth (TSB; growth medium for Phi6) for these experiments, which is very simple compared to the respiratory fluid that typically surrounds enveloped viruses that have been expelled into the environment. The medium composition can have a profound effect on virus infectivity (13). We have previously hypothesized that mucin glycoproteins might provide a protective effect for viruses against changes in RH (13). Understanding how different media protect viruses from changes in environmental conditions should be a future research priority.",

Host susceptibility plays a very important role in disease transmission, and immune function may vary seasonally with temperature, humidity, and solar radiation (9).

First, as we have shown that the choice of statistical model has a significant effect on the conclusions, we recommend reanalyzing the data collected from previous studies of the effect of RH versus AH on enveloped virus infectivity using different statistical models beyond linear regression. Future efforts are also needed to study viruses that require more stringent biosafety protocols to assess whether the results shown here are generalizable to pathogenic viruses. Additionally, we recommend that future studies use more physiologically relevant media (e.g., respiratory fluid) to test the hypotheses that (i) medium composition has an effect on virus infectivity when exposed to different environmental conditions and (ii) glycoproteins provide a protective effect for virus in droplets against changes in RH and temperature. Finally, an interdisciplinary research effort is needed to define optimal indoor environmental conditions. Ultimately, these efforts will lead to improved strategies to control infectious disease transmission in the built environment.",

Second, 75% was near the middle of the range (60 to 85% RH) in which we saw the largest virus inactivation. Third, we were able to test a full range of temperatures at 75% RH. A sensor (HOBO Temp/RH 2.5% data logger, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA) placed inside the chamber logged the temperature and RH.
