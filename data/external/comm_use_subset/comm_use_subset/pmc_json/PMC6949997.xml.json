The disease presents clinically with recurrent fever and signs reflecting the distribution of organ lesions. The development of FIP lesions is triggered by activated, virus infected monocytes. In the presence of a generalised activation of venous endothelial cells, these monocytes induce the granulomatous phlebitis that is considered to be the first and hallmark lesion and can occur in a range of organs [4]. Endothelial cell activation, together with other systemic changes such as fever, indicates excessive systemic cytokine release though the precise sources remain unclear [4,5,6].",

In cats, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 are the main mediators of the acute phase inflammatory response [8] and cats with FIP exhibit clear clinical and histological evidence of overt inflammatory processes. Despite this, there are conflicting results on the presence and systemic levels of these cytokines in FIP. Early studies found high IL-1 and IL-6 activity in sera, ascitic fluid, and the supernatant of cultured peritoneal exudate cells of cats with FIP [9,10]. However, IL-6 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were found to be unaltered, only mildly increased, or variable in FIP [11,12,13], whilst IL-10 and IL-12 transcription was markedly depressed [11].",

Additionally, CRFK cells are not primary immune cells so are unlikely to exhibit the same response. In vitro studies using peritoneal macrophages, a system that is closer to the disease scenario, provided evidence of the importance of TNF-\u03b1. FIPV induced TNF-\u03b1 production in infected cells; as TNF-\u03b1 can itself upregulate the type II FCoV receptor aminopeptidase N, cells may thus enhance their own infection rate [16,17]. In turn TNF-\u03b1 functions as a possible contributor to the lymphocyte apoptosis observed in FIP [18,19]. Despite this, in natural disease, end stage FIP is associated with only a low increase or in some cases even a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 transcription in the lymphatic tissues themselves [20,21]. In conjunction, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 transcription showed no to low increases in the lymphatic tissues in FIP whilst IL-10 and IL-12 decreased or remained unchanged [20,21].",

We therefore first hypothesised a role for hepatocytes in cytokine production, as these have already been shown to be active in the disease. In cats with FIP, hepatocyte produced acute phase proteins such as haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and in particular alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) have been shown to be elevated; to the extent that they are considered key elements of the diagnostic process [22,23,24]. Although not thus far studied in felines, human and murine hepatocytes have also been shown capable of producing cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 [25,26,27,28,29,30]. Additionally, our group has previously identified constitutive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by feline cardiomyocytes, which increases in systemic inflammatory disease [31]. This led to the second hypothesis that the heart is an additional source of cytokines and thereby contributes to the systemic inflammatory status that allows FIP lesions to develop.",

Antibodies were raised against the C-terminus of the proteins by using 14 amino acid long synthetic peptides with an additional cysteine residue at the N-terminus coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier (see supplemental Table S1). All antisera had been determined by the supplier by ELISA to have a titre greater than 1:10,000 when tested against the peptide antigen.

However, the inflammatory cells likely played a minor role in the overall hepatic transcription, since we extracted RNA from tissue specimens without grossly visible FIP lesions and generally found immunohistological evidence of more consistent cytokine expression by hepatocytes than by inflammatory cells. The different antibodies showed variation in their staining patterns, being either relatively diffuse or showing more varying intensity between hepatocytes. The precise cause of this is unknown but may reflect variations in cytokine expression and release beyond the scope of this study.",

Immunohistological staining results did not allow an accurate quantification of translation, nor could we identify a direct correlation between mRNA and protein levels. This has a number of possible explanations\u2014the different regions sampled, the different sensitivities of the two methods, the time lapse between transcription and translation (with our samples all taken at a single time point), and the manifold levels of pre- and post-translational regulation to which cytokines are exposed. Taking TNF-\u03b1 alone, there is regulation of mRNA at export, post-transcription, and translation, with multiple mechanisms at each stage [42]. However, our objective was to confirm rather than quantify parenchymal cytokine expression and, together with what is known of cytokine function, our results provide strong evidence that hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes may indeed play a role in systemic inflammatory disease and hence the pathogenesis of FIP. This is supported by data from a mouse study showing that hepatocytes can produce at least as much IL-6 per cell as macrophages [28]. Traditionally thought to have more of a reactive or even bystander role in disease, the parenchymal cells may in fact provide a large amplifying step in a cascade of cytokine release. This role is, however, secondary and rather unspecific, as systemic inflammatory diseases were found to be associated with myocardial transcription of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 at levels similar to those seen in cats with FIP. Whether other organs such as the lung (in which resident macrophages such as pulmonary intravascular macrophages may be targets for FCoV [43]) also have a role to play remains to be investigated.",

IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 may also contribute to the hypoalbuminaemia and weight loss seen in FIP via decreased albumin production and increased muscle breakdown respectively [8,44]. Adhesion molecule expression and chemokine production by endothelial cells (EC) is induced by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, leading to leukocyte binding [45]. In line with this, upregulation of \u03b22-integrins was seen on leukocytes from cats with FIP [4,46]. The cytokines can then be expected to contribute to the destruction of the vascular basal lamina seen in FIP phlebitis [1,3,4,47], as they upregulate matrix metalloproteinase secretion from monocytes [48,49].",

In wet FIP, significant IL-6 activity has previously been reported in sera and peritoneal exudate cells [9]. The wet, dry, and mixed forms of FIP indicate overlapping disease states with a variable degree of vascular permeability [51,52]. IL-6 can induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and pulmonary vascular permeability [53,54,55], and the degree of ascites was found to be correlated with serum VEGF levels in cats with FIP [51]. This could explain, via VEGF upregulation, the particularly high hepatic IL-6 transcription levels seen in FIP cats with effusions in our study. Hepatic IL-6 release could also contribute to the progressive plasma cell infiltration seen in older FIP lesions [3,41], as IL-6 induces the final maturation of B cells into plasma cells [56]. It might also influence myocardial cytokine transcription, which showed a lower increase in FIP when compared to control cats than the liver samples and might therefore suggest a later, reactive involvement of the myocardium in the disease process. Showing a reactive response might also be the reason that no difference in myocardial transcription was observed between the effusive and non-effusive forms of FIP. However, further investigations into the time course of FIPV infection are needed.",

The similar IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA concentrations in the myocardium of young control cats and cats with FIP confirms our previous finding of a generally more reactive/inflammatory myocardium in young cats [35], which might also contribute to the increased susceptibility of young cats to FIP, with TNF-\u03b1 subsequently further amplifying the inflammatory process.",

In our study we found an overall higher hepatic IL-12:IL-10 mRNA ratio in FIP than in healthy FCoV-infected cats. Despite being archetypally pro-inflammatory, at high concentrations IL-12 can inhibit the immune response and the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [62,63]. In contrast to the liver, the mesenteric lymph nodes were previously found to downregulate IL-12 transcription in FIP, with IL-10 levels unaffected [20,21].
