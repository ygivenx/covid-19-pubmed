The number of poultry sold within a day, and the type of poultry were also considered. Indeed, the susceptibility of chickens and ducks (muscovy or mallard duck derived breeds) to infection is known to differ [28]. Moreover, the supply management, and frequency and quantity of the surplus (unsold poultry reoffered for sale the following day) could impact on the length of time that poultry spent at market. The surplus frequency referred to the proportion of days traders reported having had surplus and the surplus volume to the proportion of birds left unsold when having a surplus. The surplus frequency was captured in 2 ways: the usual surplus frequency, recorded as a categorical variable (categories: never, sometimes, half of the time, often, always), and the surplus frequency in the last week, defined as the proportion of days with a surplus out of the number of trading days during the week preceding the interview. Since both variables were highly correlated (correlation ratio = 0.84), only the surplus frequency in the past week was kept in the analysis. The management of the supply described the frequency at which poultry were purchased, and whether poultry were purchased the day before being offered for sale and kept overnight at traders' homes.

However, these seller profiles may still play an active role in virus spread. A substantial proportion of Cluster V.2 sellers were mobile, visiting several markets to sell and/or purchase poultry. This could enable them to spread infection between LBMs. If infectious birds are introduced into LBMs populated by Cluster V.4 sellers, characterized by large sale volumes and long periods of time spent at market per day, infection of susceptible birds could result. Although these newly infected birds are unlikely to remain in LBMs for a sufficient period of time to infect others, their sale to traders operating in other LBMs could lead to virus spread between LBMs. Indeed, most large-scale sellers (V.4) operated in Ha Noi wholesale markets, from which a substantial part of the poultry population was then sold to retail market sellers (data not shown). In contrast, Cluster V.1 sellers (farmers and irregular sellers) were unlikely to play a major role in spatial virus spread as they only traded in markets located in their vicinity.",

Therefore, knowing the type and location of a given LBM provides a good indicator of its seller profile composition, the proportion of poultry sold by each seller profile and, thus, the market's risk of sustaining HPAIV H5N1 circulation. LBMs located in the rural province of Bac Giang probably play a limited role in virus perpetuation. By contrast, most Ha Noi retail and mixed markets were dominated by Cluster V.3 sellers, which could permit virus maintenance. However, the low number of sellers and the low volume of sales might increase the risk of stochastic extinction of viruses, even with frequent surpluses. Two LBMs of this group were predominantly or exclusively populated by Cluster V.2 sellers and were located in districts which shared key features with Bac Giang province: rural areas with a large number of poultry farms. In contrast, other Ha Noi retail and mixed markets were located in, or close to, urban centres. This urban tropism of sellers at higher risk of maintaining virus circulation was also observed in Cambodia. The markets located in Phnom Penh or its outskirts were almost exclusively populated by sellers with high surpluses (C.2), similar to Vietnamese Cluster V.3 sellers, whilst Cambodian Cluster C.1 sellers, unlikely to allow virus maintenance, operated in provinces other than Phnom Penh.",

This information could be directly collected from market managers and would not require a labor-intensive survey. The implementation of strategies aiming at breaking virus amplification cycles in all markets is unnecessary, and also impractical given that LBMs are ubiquitous. Targeting control measures to a few selected markets would not only reduce the overall cost, but would also allow closer monitoring and proper implementation. Simple hygiene measures and culling of unsold birds may be very effective in breaking the virus amplification cycle [11], [34], [35]. Successfully implemented in Hong Kong, such measures would, however, need to be adapted to each local setting in order to minimize their negative impact on trade.",

HPAIV H5N1 is likely to circulate in the study population. However, only the potential of LBMs to become virus reservoirs has been assessed in this survey. Complementing the findings with virological sampling of markets would be necessary to conclude that these high risk LBMs are truly virus reservoirs. Moreover, since the sampling frame is not representative of the population as a whole but of the largest markets in specific regions, inferences about the study population are necessarily limited. When asked to name the most populated markets, traders were more likely to name markets where they regularly operated, or of which they had personal knowledge, for example by being in their vicinity. However, as traders interviewed in Bac Giang province often named the same markets, regardless of the district where the interview took place, it is likely that most of the largest markets were identified. Three markets located in Bac Giang city were among the most commonly named markets, but authorization to visit was not possible as poultry sales at these sites had been officially prohibited. In Ha Noi province, some large retail and mixed markets may have been missed, as only a few districts were visited. However, the retail and mixed markets identified in Ha Noi were likely to be similar to those not identified, given similar population densities and housing.",
