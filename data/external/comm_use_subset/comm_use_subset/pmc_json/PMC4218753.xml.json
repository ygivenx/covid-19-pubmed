It is expressed by Clara cells and alveolar type II cells in the lung. SP-D has a multimeric structure which gives it the ability to agglutinate pathogens, as well as aid in the clearance of apoptotic cells, cellular debris, and foreign particles in the lung [reviewed in [1]].",

In addition, there have been studies examining the levels of SP-D in subjects with Turner syndrome [78], paraquat intoxication [79], swimming in variably treated waters [80], lung transplant patients [81], patients undergoing neurosurgical operations [82], drowning victims [83], polymyositis/dermatomyositis [84], dementia [85], lupus [86], and sleep apnea [87].",

When grouping according to the ELISA configuration used, one configuration consistently resulted in significantly higher values than the two other configurations for which multiple references were obtained (Figure 1a).

Using the manufacturer's recommended matrix (1% BSA) produced results very similar to a 10% FBS matrix, with both giving very consistent measurements and the greatest values. The values for PBS matrix gave similarly consistent measurements, but at a slightly lower value. This effect may be due to adsorption of rhSP-D without a carrier protein to the tubes used for serial dilutions [90]. Serum Matrix (Millipore), which had background levels of SP-D, also inhibited detection of recombinant SP-D at higher concentrations. All further standard curves were established by serial dilutions of recombinant SP-D in 1% BSA in PBS.",

In addition, it was previously demonstrated that SP-D has the ability to bind to various immunoglobulins in a calcium-dependent manner [91]. In order to determine the effects of calcium in the context of SP-D detection by ELISA, ELISAs were performed with antibodies diluted in buffer with or without calcium. We examined these effects on both recombinant SP-D and SP-D in plasma with either the ELISA kit's detection antibody or a polyclonal goat anti-SP-D antibody produced by the same manufacturer. In all cases but one, the addition of 5 mM calcium to the dilution and wash buffer resulted in a small (\u223c17%) but significant increase in SP-D concentration relative to detection in the absence of calcium (Figure 4b). It is important to note that with the kit reagents, since the relative increase in detection of recombinant SP-D and SP-D in plasma in the presence of calcium is very similar, the extrapolated SP-D concentration in plasma when using a standard curve of recombinant SP-D should not significantly change. Interestingly, while the inclusion of calcium increased the recognition of native SP-D by the polyclonal antibody, it had no effect on the detection of recombinant SP-D by this antibody. Although it is beyond the scope of this study, future work will explore whether this effect is due to an increase in antibody recognition of antigen, increase in non-specific binding of antibodies by captured SP-D, or an increase through another mechanism.",

Storage and processing of samples as well as diluent used for the standard have minor effects on the level of SP-D extrapolated by ELISA. Although these results may partially explain the variations seen in reported SP-D values in the blood, it is important to note the caveats associated with this review of the literature. For the comparison of healthy control groups amongst various studies, it is possible that differences in ethnic background and/or geographical location from which subjects were recruited may contribute to the variations seen when the same ELISA configuration was employed, as could the type of anticoagulant. However, we would expect the range of samples between healthy populations of different studies to be similar. In addition, assuming that an appropriately matched control population was used for comparison to the disease population, the fold change between healthy and disease should be more similar than what was observed in the literature.",

            "text": "Measuring SP-D by ELISA presents a problem due to its multimeric structure. For each molecule (a complete dodecamer) of multimerized protein, there are at least 12 of the same epitopes present. Due to this property, it is not necessary to use discrete antibodies in a sandwich ELISA format to capture and then detect SP-D; even the same monoclonal antibody could be used for both. However, this may cause a difference in read out compared to using antibodies that detect different epitopes, due to the fact that the degree of multimerization has been shown to vary in the lungs during different disease states [92] and using the same monoclonal antibody would fail to detect a monomer. Even using two monoclonals that recognize distinct epitopes to measure SP-D in its native state would be confounded by differences in the degree of multimerization. For example, if an antibody against the carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D was used to capture and an antibody against the neck region of SP-D was used to detect, a single, captured monomer of SP-D would be able to bind a single anti-neck antibody. However, a single, captured dodecamer would be able to bind 12 anti-neck antibodies. In order to accurately establish absolute concentrations by ELISA, it would be important that the multimeric structure of the standard was equivalent to that of the samples, as there could be differences in antigen binding in higher order multimers due to steric hinderance. Unfortunately, we did not have the necessary resources to examine the influence of the degree of multimerization on ELISA measurements.",

These modifications may, in fact, mask the epitope recognized by an ELISA antibody. This may account for one of the largest differences seen in the reported ELISA measurements of SP-D in serum/plasma, as the highest concentrations of SP-D came from the non-commercially available ELISA which used purified, native SP-D as a standard; this is opposed to almost all others, which used recombinantly expressed SP-D as a standard. Regardless of whether the antibodies used were raised against recombinant SP-D or purified native, because the post-translational modifications can vary from one patient to the next, this presents a significant obstacle to accurate measurements of natural SP-D using antibodies.",
