Ninety percent of AIDS cases are transmitted through mucosal routes, such as sexual contact [1]. Targeting immune responses to the site of viral entry can protect the body and help clear the viral reservoir before HIV dissemination [2], [3]. There is evidence that HIV-specific S-IgA could neutralize HIV in the cervicovaginal lavage fluids of uninfected partners of highly exposed persons [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The SIV-specific CTLs, which are induced by immunization with an attenuated SHIV, were found to be associated with protection against vaginal challenge in rhesus macaques [9]. Most researchers believe that a vaccine against HIV-1 would need to induce a neutralizing antibody, CD4+ Th, and competent CD8+ CTL responses at the initial site of viral entry. Systemic vaccination is not sufficient to generate effective compartmentalized mucosal immunity [2], [10].",

As a live vaccine vector, it was used for the prevention and eradication of many infectious diseases due to its broad host range, large foreign DNA capacity, lack of carcinogenicity, and ability to induce the expression of foreign antigens in eukaryotic cells [15], [16], [17]. The recombinant wild vaccinia virus is generally avoided for safety reasons, particularly with regard to young children and immune-compromised individuals [18], [19]. As a result, in China, Chen and his colleges developed a series of highly attenuated vaccinia virus Tiantan strains by decreasing the neurotoxicity of the virus [20], [21], [22]. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the highly attenuated vaccinia virus could induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [20]. One intranasal immunization of this virus protected animals from challenge with the pathogenic vaccinia WR strain [21]. The National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention (China) developed an AIDS vaccine candidate using DNA priming and rVV Tiantan boost with env and gag-pol of CRF07_B'/C as inserts. It has been approved by the SFDA for a phase I trials. Volunteer recruitment started in Beijing in November of 2007 [23], [24].",

Enhancing these immune responses or reducing the necessary dose, would render the vaccine easier to make and safer for patients. Regarding obstacles to mucosal immunization, the first line of opposition that a vaccine encounters is the long-lined mucosal epithelium. There have been some reports that measles and Junin viruses infect the polarized epithelium and are released in a polarized way [25], [26], [27]. We performed this study to evaluate interactions between recombinant vaccinia viruses and epithelial cells and to determine whether epithelial cells released HIV antigens in a polarized way. Upon finding that they did, we performed more tests to see what influence this polarized release has on antigen delivery and specific immune responses. Here we report that recombinant HIV vaccinia virus can infect the mucosal epithelium in vitro and in BALB/c mice; both the progeny vaccinia virus and HIV antigen are preferentially released from the apical surfaces and colchicine treatment causes unpolarized antigen expression, delivery, and enhanced specific immune responses. These results provide guidance for immune enhancement and dose reduction in HIV vaccination.",

The limited efficiency of antigen delivery was found to be due to polarized distribution in the epithelium.

Even high doses of most vaccinia virus vaccine candidates cannot induce strong mucosal IgA responses, which are related to protection from viral challenge [29]. Other studies have been performed with doses of rVTT ranging from 2\u00d7106 to 5\u00d7106 PFU/mouse [29], [34], [37]. Only low specific antibody titers were produced [29], [34]. Large doses are harder to prepare and can cause side effects. However, i.n. administration of recombinant vaccinia virus alongside HN or F was found to protect mice from challenge by Sendai virus via the respiratory duct [29]. When inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes, recombinant vaccinia virus with S protein from SARS-CoV induced 20\u2013100 times the level of Nab in serum than that induced by rMVA [22]. A means to increase the efficiency and to reduce dose size would be useful to researchers, doctors, and patients interested in this vaccine.",

Vermeer et al. also reported that the vaccinia virus infected differentiated human airway epithelia and was released mainly from the apical surface in vitro\n[38]. Huang et al. reported that SIV budded basolaterally in polarized Vero C1008 cells [39]. Randall et al. reported that, when polarized Vero-pFN cells were infected with VVgag, similar amounts of p24 capsid protein were released into virus particles at the apical and at the basolateral surface. In contrast, when cells are infected with both VVgag and VVenv, 94% of p24 and all gpl20 are associated with particles released into the basolateral medium [40]. These results indicate that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein renders virus particles containing the gag protein to be released from the basolateral surface [40]. However, after we co-infected polarized Caco-2 cells with rVTT-gagpol and rVTT-env via the apical surface, no increased associative p24 or VLP p24 was detected in the basolateral medium. We also infected polarized Vero C1008 cells with rVTT-gagpol via the apical surface. The integrity of the cell layers deteriorated 4\u201312 hours after infection depending on the MOI (data not shown). Before the cell layers broke down, p24 and vaccinia virus were mainly released from the apical surface. After that, more p24 and virus was present in the basolateral medium than in the apical. In contrast, Caco-2 cell layers maintained their integrity after infection: p24 and virus were still released mainly from the apical surface. The reason for this might be that Caco-2 cells are from the epithelial cells of the colon, which is mucosal tissue, while Vero cells are derived from the epithelial cells of kidney. This makes Caco-2 cells more representative of mucosal epithelia in vivo than Vero cells.",

We showed that colchicine acts by disrupting polarized release in vitro (Caco-2 cell layers) and in immunized mice (Figs. 5 and 6). In vitro, the 3-\u00b5m pore in the transwell membrane was used to make sure that rVTT was released only from the basolateral surface. The 0.4-\u00b5m transwell pore was able to block basolateral release, showing only 1/103 as many basolaterally released viruses as samples equipped with 3-\u00b5m pores. The release of p24 antigen was not significantly different (data not shown). This implies that, due to the large size of the vaccinia virus, it passed through 3-\u00b5m transwell pores more easily than through 0.4-\u00b5m pores.",

This is consistent with the situation in vitro, in which cell layers turned out some plaques but maintained the integrity of the epithelial layer relatively well. One explanation of how colchicine treatment was able to increase the rates of infection and expression may be this: Colchicine influenced dissemination between cells during the second period of infection. During rVTT-gagpol infection of the epithelial cells, progeny viruses were released from the apical surface, from which they infected neighboring cells, again via the apical surface (Fig. 8A). Because transportation relies on microtubules, depolymerization of those microtubules by colchicinie caused some vesicles to target the basolateral surface (Fig. 8B) [36]. The basolaterally targeted vesicles fused with the upper two thirds of the lateral surface, not just the region immediately beneath the tight junction [36]. In addition, vaccinia virus more readily infects differentiated human airway epithelia from the basolateral surface than from the apical surface [38]. In this way, colchicine treatment rendered infected cells much more likely to infect other cells.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrated that the unpolarized release of virus and antigen increased specific antibody responses. Other studies have described the impact of colchicine on immune responses. Colchicine can act as an immune suppressor at high doses (100 \u00b5g/ml) and an immune enhancer at low doses (0.5\u20131 \u00b5g/ml) [44]. It can increase immune responses when co-administered with antigens, enhancing immune response by about a factor of two [44]. In this study, the doses were 80 \u00b5g/ml in vitro and 4\u201340 \u00b5g/mouse (1000\u201310,000 \u00b5g/ml). Previous reports indicate that both would result in immune suppression. We found that colchicine does not act as an immune enhancer under these conditions. In addition, immune enhancers can more easily enhance specific immune responses to protein antigens than to live viral vectors. This is because live viral vectors activate the natural immune response on their own. In our research, the unpolarized release of antigen was clear (Figs. 5 and 6) and the immune effect was more intense and widespread (Fig. 7). The increase in specific antibody responses were mainly due to the unpolarized release and not to the slightly nonspecific enhancement of immune responses.",

Although they cannot display traditional neutralization, they are very important to HIV vaccines. First, p24-specific IgA neutralizes HIV in cells intracellularly. This was proven in measles by one member of our team (unpublished data). She found that viral replication could be inhibited by binding of the internal protein M of measles by specific IgA in epithelial cells. This phenomenon was named intracellular neutralizing. Second, the p24 gag genes are relatively conservative, so their specific IgA is able to target more than one subtype of HIV. That of env cannot because its genes mutate readily.",
