In combination with NGS, partial genomes of novel viruses have been detected by this method28, 29. As with non-depleting methods, extensive further work is needed to fully characterise detected viruses, and when applied to diagnostic virology, the read depths and genome coverages remain low even at high viral loads30\u201333. Most groups selectively deplete rRNA by hybridising rRNA-specific DNA \u2018scissor probes\u2019 to the extracted nucleic acids, and digesting the rRNA/DNA duplexes with RNAse H34, 35.

Hence the three main aims of metagenomic virology are to detect & identify known agents irrespective of their diversity, to discover novel agents of disease, and to obtain complete sequence information of detected viruses. Most existing protocols achieve a maximum of two of these aims, but difficulties in selectively isolating viral RNA species and short read sequences from those of the super-abundant host nucleic acid have limited the utility of metagenomic approaches in diagnostic virology.",

When applied to a series of clinical samples, we could elucidate simultaneously the full genome sequences of both a novel subtype belonging to HCV genotype 6 and a hitherto-undetected human pegivirus. Additionally, our system was able to recover viral sequences from a panel of diverse RNA viruses diluted in human plasma, with a broad correlation between the genomic coverage and depth metrics and approximate concentration.

For the majority of viruses in the VMR Panel, whilst dilution in plasma reduced the total percentage of reads recovered when compared to the panel diluted in PBS, a greater breadth of genome coverage was achieved. In the absence of any host nucleic acid background, it is possible that the PBS extracts had such ultra-low quantities of RNA that despite the adjustments made to the library preparation protocol, the RNA was over-fragmented, leading to a smaller number of genome fragments that were individually amplified to a greater extent than the larger array of fragments surviving the plasma extraction.",

At an influenza A virus concentration of over 105 copies/ml, this dropped to just 0.5%, and at a reovirus concentration of 103\u2013104 copies/ml, no viral reads were detected24. With our method, whole genomes were obtained for those with the highest viral loads, and for minority viral targets, there was a correlation between ostensible quantity and coverage, including for two viruses undetectable by the panel distributor42, a result superior to that recently obtained from influenza in clinical respiratory samples65. Again, the presence of high quantities of one or more target is likely to have inhibited the representation of the minority species such that if tested individually, superior depths and coverages would seem likely. With further reduction to the fragmentation time, or even its abolition, it may be possible to use this method to reconstruct genomes from old, partially degraded samples such as those recently used to re-evaluate the early HIV epidemic in the Americas66.",
