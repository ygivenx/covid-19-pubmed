The estimation of model marginal log-likelihood through the PS and SS for the twelve coalescent demographic models including parametric models (constant population size, exponential growth and logistic growth) and nonparametric models (Bayesian skyline plot, BSP) with strict, uncorrelated lognormal distribution (UCLD) and uncorrelated exponential distribution (UCED) relaxed molecular clocks were calculated (S2 Table). Rates of nucleotide substitution per site, per year and the tMRCA were also estimated. In addition, a Bayesian skyline plot to infer the population dynamics in terms of changing levels of relative genetic diversity (Ne\u03c4) through time was performed. For BSP analysis data were collected and plotted using Graphpad Prism software 5.0 (1992\u20132007, Graphpad Prism software Inc.).

The polygenic nature of IBDV pathogenicity, in particular the clear role of both segments (A and B) in vvIBDV\u2019s pathogenesis [17,58], has shown that the characterization of IBDV strains based on both genome segments is essential to understand the epidemiological behavior of this viral agent. Nonetheless, the complete sequencing of both segments is impractical in routine practice in diagnostic laboratories. In addition, utilizing the full genome for molecular epidemiology studies would result in costly computational analyses, which would be also unfeasible [59]. Therefore, the use of phylogenetic markers for molecular epidemiology studies of IBDV is a useful and needful approach.",

The initial selection of B-marker was based on two main aspects: length of the fragment and location. Being the B-marker less than 500bp (430bp) of length, this fragment can be easily obtained and sequenced in laboratories with limited resources. Likewise, the size of the B-marker facilitates the computational analyses, avoiding delayed results generated by large size fragments (Reviewed in: [24]). In addition, B-marker is framed between N-terminal domain and partial F domain of VP1 [30]. The N-terminal domain of IBDV VP1 folds into a mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structure. This domain has been associated with the protein priming process and interacts with the fingers and thumb domains [60]. The F domain has been linked to the nucleotide recognition and binding process as well as to the RNA template binding mechanism [30]. Other domains such as domain D, starting from residue 252 (end of B-marker) are involved in structural integrity, and C-terminal domain is highly conserved not only among IBDV strains but also for all members of Birnaviridae family [30]. Thus, the structural domains in which B-marker is framed have a functional role in VP1 more than structural constrains; therefore, this region could be more influenced by evolutionary changes than possible negative selective restrictions.",

When a dataset is saturated, phylogenetic reconstruction may be misled by homoplasious signal [23], which is evidenced by no further increase in transitions observed despite increasing genetic distance, indicating that multiple substitutions at nucleotide positions have occurred. The gradual increase of transitions/transversions observed with respect to genetic distance for B-marker suggests a lack of saturation for this selected region. Correspondingly, Xia\u2019s test supported the same outcome. Xia\u2019s test is based on the ratio of observed entropy to the entropy of full substitution saturation defined as the index of substitution saturation (I\nSS). If this value is not significantly smaller than the critical ISS (I\nSSC) (value at which the sequences start to fail to recover the correct tree), the sequences have experienced severe substitution saturation and should not be used for phylogenetic reconstruction [23]. From the results obtained for B-marker we can infer that this region does not experience substitution saturation and can be used for phylogenetic studies.",

            "text": "The expansion of vvIBDV strains was linked to a reassortment event of the genome (segment B) of IBDV with a mutant VP2 background, which caused a sudden increase in virulence of these kind of strains [14]. Thenceforth, vvIBDV strains have been kept antigenically and genetically homogeneous, spreading to most of the countries (with the exception of Australia) at least for two decades. However, the recent isolation of vvIBDV strains with rare natural segment-B-reassorted [25,26] have evidenced a possible change in the genetic structure and stability of vvIBDV strains. Thereby, Ingrao et al. [73] suggested that it is probably only a matter of time until vvIBDVs are replaced by an emerging strain with new antigenic or pathotypic properties. In fact, He et al. [25] have currently reported that reassortant IBDV strains were dominantly prevalent in southern China during 2000\u20132012 [25].",

In fact, the ancestor for the cluster in which Cuban strain 117/96Pir96 was located was framed around the year 1976, coincident with the first introduction of the virus in the country [16]. Therefore, the reassortment event that originated the strain 117/96Pir96 seems to have occurred between the novel vvIBDV strains introduced in Cuba around 1991 and the atIBDV strains, which had been circulating among the Cuban poultry population since 1977.",

Additional pathogenicity and antigenicity studies would also be required for BF3Hab97 and BF24Hab11 strains.

These different rates could be explained by several factors. On one hand, segment B from non-vvIBDV lineage has been concomitant with a host for a longer period than vvIBDV lineage. Hence, non-vvIBDV lineage may have a fitness advantage by keeping a narrow population rather than undergoing frequent changes, therefore facilitating a better host-virus equilibrium [75]. On the other hand, the application of different types of vaccines that did not fully protect chickens against infection by vvIBDV strains could have induced a \"selective noise\" with greater chance for beneficial mutations to accumulate. This \u201cselective noise\u201d allows occasional slips from the first lightest mutational loads (originated by the immune response of the host induced by the vaccination) towards an increase of the weight of mutational loads (given by the quasispecies cloud) (Reviewed in [76]) with a consequent increase in the substitution rate.",
