            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is an RNA virus, which poses a great health risk causing seasonal epidemics and periodically worldwide pandemics. Despite their seasonal character, influenza epidemics are unpredictable and have been recognized as a major cause of morbidity and increased mortality [1]. Influenza virus infection leads to a disease that results in 0.25\u20130.5 million deaths annually worldwide [2]. Currently, two classes of anti-virals are available for the treatment of seasonal human influenza: neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) and M2-channel blockers (rimantadine and amantadine) acting on viral spread and entry, respectively [3]. Nevertheless, vaccination is still the most effective preventive measure, regardless to the constant changes of the viral antigenic epitopes (antigen drift), demanding the annual renewal of the selected vaccine strains [4, 5]. Furthermore, based on the segmented nature of IAV genome, co-infections can lead to reassortants with completely new antigenic characteristics (antigen shift) that can cause pandemic outbreaks [6, 7]. Thus, the efficacy of currently approved control strategies is limited because IAVs frequently escape the immune response via antigen drift and shift [8]. Therefore, an alternative therapeutic strategy that is effective irrespective of viral subtype by directly attacking the genetic material of the virus would be beneficial.",

Furthermore, we reported that binase degrades vRNA, which is not protected by the virion/RNP complex and that binase added to cells (HEK293, A549) reduces of a GFP reporter gene expression by a transient IAV mini-genome system [21, 22]. Moreover, we showed that binase is able to penetrate into A549 cells [23] and that treatment of IAV-infected A549 cells led to titer reduction and reduced the viral NP mRNA amount 12 h post-infection (h p.i.) without affecting mRNA levels of cellular housekeeping proteins [22].",

The HAI titers were below the limit of detection (<1:10) (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Additionally, we found that the anti-viral activity of binase was not related to a direct interaction with viral RNA within intact viral particles. Envelope- and viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP)-protected viral RNA genome of H1N1pdm09 was not affected by binase following 30 min of incubation of intact viral particles with binase at the concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 U/ml. As analyzed by RT-PCR at different cycle numbers (20, 25, 30 cycles), the protected full length viral RNA remained unaffected by binase, suggesting that binase did not reduce the virus titer by affecting the cell free virus particles. The results described above argue against an extra-cellular MOA of binase, but indicate that the MOA is likely to be related to an effect within the host cell (Fig. 2a).",

The results indicated that binase could also penetrate and accumulate in MDCK-II cells (Fig. 2b). Employing immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy, we additionally showed that binase localizes mostly in the cytosol of MDCK-II cells within 4 h p.t. (Fig. 2c).

MDCK-II cells were treated with binase 4 h before infection. Cells were then washed before adding the inoculum that was subsequently replaced by binase-containing media for up to 8 h after infection. The binase-containing media was then replaced with fresh binase-free media and virus titers were determined 12 (single-cycle) and 24 h (multi-cycle) later. This way we intended to avoid any extra-cellular effect of binase on the virus particles before initial infection, as binase was absent during the infection process. Washing the cells twice after removing the binase-containing media before adding the fresh media without binase, removed all remaining extra-cellular binase from the cell monolayers. This had been verified by immunofluorescent microscopy using an anti-binase primary antibody (data not shown). By analyzing H1N1pdm09 viral titers, collected 12 h p.i., we found that binase could significantly reduce viral propagation in MDCK-II cells by 22%.

The plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA and NP genes of H1N1pdm09 and a plasmid expressing a vRNA-like Pol1 transcript encoding the open reading frame of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene flanked by the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 noncoding regions of the NS RNA segment of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus (pPol1-CAT-RT) were used to reconstitute the viral RNP complex in vitro.

This finding restricts the MOA of binase to an activity directly within the infected cell. Yet, previous studies [13, 21, 22] observed an anti-viral effect after pre-incubation of the virus with binase prior to infection. This discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the binase added to the virions before infection was still present during infection. Therefore, binase might have entered through the interaction of the cationic binase protein with the negative charge of the cell surface [13]. The receptors of the IAV hemagglutinin on the host cell surface carry a negative charge provided by the sialic acid [37, 38] allowing the binase to contact the cell surface via electrostatic interaction and to be internalized via endocytosis independently of the virus [39]. Since the IAV enter the cells in a similar way, binase could further utilize such endosomes for efficient uptake. Interestingly, binase seems to have the ability to penetrate into cultured mammalian cells. In addition to the MDCK-II cells used for this study, binase was previously reported to be detected in A549 cells [23].",

Compared to its anti-H1N1pdm09 activity at 24 h p.i., binase showed a significant anti-viral effect at 12 h p.i., which was not very strong probably due to the restricted uptake and accumulation of the binase into the host cells during the single replication cycle. This was overcome after multicycle replication assayed after 24 h p.i.. This significant anti-viral effect was also shown for a H3N2-vict strain indicating that binase is efficiently working at 24 h p.i., regardless of the strain subtype. Based on these aforementioned observations, we advanced to test the idea of an intra-cellular MOA by investigating the effect of binase on the accumulation of viral NP, viral RNAs, mRNA of cellular housekeeping genes and on the expression activity of a mini-genome system. The quantification of viral RNAs and of viral NP in binase-treated cells, as well as of the amount of cellular mRNA encoding housekeeping genes and the expression of a reporter gene by the viral mini-genome are all showing an inhibitory effect of binase. In a similar way, it was recently shown that the cellular double-stranded-RNA-activated RNase L, a critical component of interferon-regulated anti-viral host responses, exerts its anti-viral activity during influenza virus infection by targeting specific sites in viral RNAs [40]. Unlike the cellular RNase L which has the tendency to target also the same specific sites in host cell RNAs, no significant impact on the expression of cellular housekeeping genes was observed. This has further supported the hypothesis that the IAV genome within the infected cell is the main target of binase.",
