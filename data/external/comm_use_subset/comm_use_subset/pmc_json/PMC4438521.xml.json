Following the detection of pathogen-derived components or danger signals, leukocyte recruitment to the brain via chemotaxis [4, 5] occurs via a cascade-like process that involves the expression of endothelial cell- and leukocyte-expressed adhesion molecules such as selectins and integrins [6\u20138]. During the early stage of CNS inflammation, the interactions between chemokines and their receptors also exert a profound effect by attracting immune cells to migrate across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) [9, 10].",

            "text": "CXCR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated by CXC chemokines, including murine CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 [11, 12]. Interactions between CXCR2 and its ligands play an essential role in mediating neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation. Although extensive studies have focused on the role of CXCR2 in inflammatory responses in different organs, the involvement of individual chemokines in different types of inflammatory responses remains contentious. For example, CXCL1 is essential for the host pulmonary defense to klebsiella infection [13] and mediates neutrophil recruitment during the progression of experimental Lyme arthritis [14]. However, even in the presence of high levels of CXCL1 expression, the interaction between CXCL2 and CXCR2 is still essential for neutrophil migration in response to specific antigen challenge [15]. Additionally, CXCL2 plays a more important role than CXCL1 in a viral antigen-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity response [16]. Furthermore, CXCR2 is widely expressed on neutrophils [17], lymphocytes [18], and other types of non-hematopoietic cells, including epithelial [19] and endothelial cells [20, 21]. Most studies have focused on the functions of CXCR2 expressed on hematopoietic cells, such as monocytes [22, 23] and neutrophils [24\u201327]. However, recent studies have revealed a critical role of CXCR2 expressed on non-hematopoietic cells during inflammatory responses. In a murine model of acute kidney infection, CXCR2 on non-bone marrow-derived cells influenced the neutrophil response [19]. Additionally, CXCR2 expression on resident cells is essential for the migration of mast cell progenitors in the lung of antigen-challenged mice [28]. However, the roles of CXCR2 and its ligands in CNS inflammation remain to be addressed.",

Moreover, CXCR2 or CXCL1 deficiency impaired endothelial activation by attenuating the expression of adhesion molecules. Using chimeric mice expressing CXCR2 on either hematopoietic cells or radiation-resistant non-hematopoietic cells, we showed that CXCR2 expression on radiation-resistant cells in the CNS is essential for endothelial activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, a high level of CXCL1 was detected in primary astrocyte culture and culture conditioned medium significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 on cerebral endothelial cells. Taken together, our findings revealed a previously unrecognized role of CXCR2 expressed on cerebral endothelial cells in the regulation of endothelial activation and immune cell recruitment across the BBB during CNS inflammation.",

No significant change in CXCR2 transcription was noted in primary microglia or astrocytes (Fig. 7C). Following stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 or LPS, the cerebral endothelial cells, compared with astrocytes and microglia, also expressed much higher level of CXCR2 protein (Fig. 7D). Astrocytes secreted much higher levels of CXCL1 than microglia in response to TNF-\u03b1 and LPS (Fig. 7E). Astrocyte culture conditioned medium stimulated strong expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in WT cerebral endothelial cells. Reduced expression of these molecules was observed in CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 endothelial cells (Fig. 7F).

In the current study, we showed that LPS injection into the brain significantly induced the production of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5. CXCL1, the most potent neutrophil-chemoattracting CXCR2 ligand, was upregulated in the CNS at the earliest time point and was correspondingly expressed at the highest level. The i.c.v. injection of LPS has been widely applied as an animal model for the study of brain inflammation. The dosage of 2 \u03bcg of LPS is considerably above what is observed in most infections and results in robust neutrophil recruitment. However, a significant reduction in the number of infiltrating neutrophils was observed in the brain parenchyma of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 and CXCL1\u2212/\u2212 mice after i.c.v. LPS injection.

Intravital microscopy revealed that a deficiency in either CXCR2 or CXCL1 significantly reduced leukocyte\u2013endothelial cell interactions in brain vessels. Additionally, reduced expression of P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 was observed in the brain of CXCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, it is likely that the functional CXCR2 that mediates leukocyte recruitment is located on the CNS endothelium. Our previous study reported that TNF-\u03b1 in the LPS-treated brain activated the endothelium to cause an increase in adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte recruitment [29]. In response to i.c.v. LPS injection, CXCR2 deficiency did not reduce TNF-\u03b1 levels in the brain. Clearly, a deficiency in CXCR2 or CXCL1 directly affected cerebral endothelial activation, but not microglial activation. In addition to its chemotactic properties, CXCL1 also exerts direct effects on BBB permeability. The exposure of brain microvascular endothelial cells to CXCL1 in vitro altered endothelial permeability and facilitated transendothelial monocyte migration [38]. However, in our study, CXCR2 deficiency did not affect albumin leakage across the BBB. Therefore, the reduction in neutrophil infiltration was not due to a change in the integrity of BBB but to a lack of cerebral endothelial activation resulting from CXCL1 or CXCR2 deficiency.",

Interestingly, functional CXCR2 is not expressed on circulating leukocytes from the bone marrow. Therefore, the activation of CXCR2 on leukocytes is not required for their recruitment in cerebral blood vessels. Earlier studies have identified the expression of CXCR2 on many types of CNS-residing cells [39\u201341]. This finding demonstrated that the expression of CXCR2 on CNS-residing cells, including endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, is more important than its expression on circulating cells during CNS inflammation. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 robustly induced a high expression of CXCR2 mRNA in primary murine endothelial cells, but not in primary microglia or astrocytes. High levels of expression of the CXCR2 mRNA and protein were detected in wild-type cerebral endothelial cells, which strongly indicates that endothelial CXCR2 is a key player mediating cerebral endothelial activation. To further validate the role of endothelial CXCR2, we intravenously injected SB225002 to block the function of CXCR2 in brain endothelial cells, as SB225002 in the blood circulation can easily access the brain endothelium. Compared with mice treated with LPS alone, both cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral vessels were reduced in the mice treated with both SB225002 and LPS. Taken together, these data indicate that SB225002 potently inhibited CXCR2 function on brain endothelial cells, thereby blocked leukocyte recruitment.",

Our study confirmed that astrocytes released significantly higher levels of CXCL1 than microglia in response to stimulation with LPS or TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that the main source of CXCL1 may be astrocytes. CXCL1 deficiency reduced leukocyte recruitment and endothelial activation by over 50 % in vivo. Astrocytes are essential structural components of the BBB [43, 44]; among all cell types in the brain, they have the easiest access to the brain endothelium and can release CXCL1, which possibly accumulate in the perivascular space at an extremely high concentration to activate cerebral endothelial cells. Therefore, the CXCL1 secreted from astrocytes and CXCR2 expressed on the endothelium may cooperate in contributing to cerebral endothelial activation and the subsequent leukocyte recruitment cascade during CNS inflammation.",

Our results demonstrate that CXCL1, an important factor secreted by astrocytes, also plays a critical role in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS by cooperating with CXCR2 expressed on cerebral endothelial cells.
