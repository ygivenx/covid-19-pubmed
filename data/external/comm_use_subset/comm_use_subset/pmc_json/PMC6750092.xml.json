            "text": "The importance of the translation machinery and its fidelity have been apparent since the discovery of the genetic code [1]. During translation, the ribosome reads nucleotide triplets in a successive, nonoverlapping fashion. For a given coding sequence, it is the start codon (most likely AUG) that establishes the reading frame. Since there is no punctuation between codons for successive amino acid residues, all three reading frames give rise to different codon sequences. However, only one reading frame primarily serves as the coding template for functional proteins because a high frequency of stop signals exists in alternative frames [2]. This feature represents a strong evolutionary optimization of codon sequences that minimizes the consequence of frameshift errors [3]. Unlike missense errors, which are not necessarily destructive to proteins, frameshift errors are deleterious as premature termination often leads to nonfunctional translational products. Therefore, the ribosome must keep the correct reading frame for hundreds to thousands of codons during translation to ensure proper protein production.",

Although codon:anticodon pairing is central to decoding accuracy, there is an extensive network of interaction between mRNA, rRNA, and ribosomal proteins [5]. The stepwise, codon by codon, progression of the ribosome along the mRNA from the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction is primarily driven by translocation [6]. During this step, the ribosome undergoes massive conformational rearrangement, allowing movement of P- and A-site tRNAs into the E- and P-sites, respectively [7\u201310]. It is thought that the coordinated rotation of large and small subunits ensures one codon precision in the movement of mRNA and the attached tRNAs after peptidyl transfer [11]. However, tremendous flexibility exists. In bacteria, while elongation factor G (EF-G) mediates one codon forward movement of mRNA:tRNA complexes, elongation factor 4 (EF4) catalyzes back-translocation [12]. Lack of EF4 has been shown to reduce translation fidelity under stress conditions [13], suggesting that translocation is error-prone.",

            "text": "While ribosomes must maintain the correct reading frame in order to produce functional proteins, some cis-acting signals located in mRNAs are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) [14]. Such recoding events have been exploited by viruses to expand the genetic coding capacity within their limited genome size [15, 16]. The typical signals for \u20131 PRF include a slippery sequence, a downstream secondary structure (usually a pseudoknot), and a short spacer in between. With an increasing amount of PRF signals identified, it is clear that the ribosome bears tremendous flexibility in decoding mRNAs. The rich communication between the ribosome and the message is thus equally, if not more, important as codon:anticodon pairing in maintaining translation fidelity. However, our understanding of individual PRF cases provides limited insights on how the ribosome normally maintains the correct reading frame [17\u201320]. The fundamental question centers on how the ribosome is able to achieve remarkable precision for the majority of mRNA coding sequences while permitting off-track in certain regions.",

Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets obtained from eukaryotic cells, we uncovered universal \u201csticky\u201d sequences within the coding region that retains the ribosome by pairing with 18S rRNA. Analogous to the internal Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences in prokaryotic mRNAs [21], the eukaryotic \u201csticky\u201d sequences contribute to pervasive translational pausing. Importantly, the interaction between the mRNA \u201csticky\u201d sequence and the 3\u2032 end of 18S rRNA offers a gripping mechanism after decoding to guide the ribosome in the correct reading frame during translation. In addition, we found that mRNA coding sequences are subject to multilevel optimization during evolution to minimize frameshift errors. Our work illustrates new layers of information embedded within protein-coding sequences that extends our understanding of the genetic code.",

            "text": "To understand how ribosomes normally maintain translational reading frame fidelity, it is necessary to determine the spontaneous frameshift (FS) rate under physiological conditions. We adopted a luciferase-based bicistronic reporter assay, in which both the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the Firefly luciferase (Fluc) are synthesized from the same mRNA (Figure 1(a)) [22]. A flag-tag was added at the 5\u2032 end of the Rluc coding region after the start codon and the full length flag-Rluc fusion protein serves as control for in-frame translation. For the +1 FS reporter, we inserted a single cytosine (C) between flag and Rluc, thereby placing the entire Rluc coding region into frame 1. Since no AUG start codons are present in frame 1 before the Rluc coding region, any detectable Rluc activities are derived from the +1 FS event during flag synthesis. To eliminate Fluc products via leaky scanning, we conducted anti-Flag immunoprecipitation in parallel. Notably, only after the FS events taking place within a window delimited by the nearest stop codons flanking the insertion site, can the shifted ribosome reach frame 1 coding region of Rluc (Figure 1(a), highlighted region). Compared to the in-frame control, we observed a reproducible +1 FS rate of 0.52% in HEK293 cells and 0.37% in MEF cells (Figure 1(a), right panel). After adjustment by the size of the FS window, the average +1 FS rate per codon in HEK293 and MEF cells is 0.04% and 0.03%, respectively. We next constructed a \u20131 FS reporter by inserting two additional bases (CA) between flag and Rluc. Once the ribosome skips two bases or slips back one base within the FS window, it will reach frame 2 Rluc coding region for translation. Compared to the +1 FS reporter, we observed a relatively lower \u20131 FS rate of 0.03% in HEK293 and 0.02% in MEF after adjustment by the size of the FS window (Figure 1(a)). This value is in the similar range of spontaneous FS rates reported previously [23].",

If spontaneous FS errors occur in a continuous manner, the overall ribosome drop-off is expected to increase as function of CDS length. However, the ratio of ribosome density between the first and second half of CDS largely maintains irrespective of the CDS size (Figure 1(d)). The same pattern also holds true in MEF cells ( and ). Interestingly, a few genes that display large drop-off are known examples of PRF.

To assess the natural reading frame accuracy of individual ribosomal steps, we took advantage of ribosome profiling data sets that permit determination of ribosome positions at a subcodon resolution [28]. Similar to previous reports [29], the overall ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) show a strong 3-nucleotide periodicity with approximately 70% of reads mapped to frame 0 (). The remaining out-of-frame reads could be due to technical artifacts. For instance, nuclease overdigestion or incomplete digestion will shift the resultant RPF from frame 0 to frame 1 or 2, respectively. Despite these inevitable variations, specific FS events occurring at particular regions could be discernable by altered phasing [30, 31]. We computed the in-frame rate (IFR) for footprints mapped to individual codon positions by calculating the percentage of RPFs aligned to frame 0. The IFR value represents, on a relative scale, how accurately the ribosome is positioned when a particular codon is encountered.",

As expected, RPFs with different 3\u2032 end codons show little variation of IFR (< 1.2-fold, Figure 2(a)), because those codons are not yet being decoded. For RPFs grouped by P-site or A-site codons, we observed a modest variation of IFR (~1.5-fold). To our surprise, when the 5\u2032 end codon identity is considered, there is a substantial variation of IFR (> 4.5-fold) among the 61 sense codons ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 (Figure 2(a)). This feature is independent of the RPF length because we observed a nearly identical pattern for RPFs with a fixed length of 28 nt (). Interestingly, for footprints with IFR values above the average, their 5\u2032 end codons mostly belong to AUG-like triplets (i.e., codons that differ from AUG by a single nucleotide) (Figure 2(b) and ).

Indeed, both the A-site and P-site codon identities influence the RPF abundance (Figure 2(a), bottom panel). Intriguingly, RPFs grouped by 5\u2032 end codons display the greatest variation of abundance with prominent pausing that appeared for footprints starting with AUG-like codons (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). In contrast to A-site or P-site codons that exhibit only weak correlation between the reading frame accuracy and the ribosome dwell time, the 5\u2032 end codon identity of RPFs influences both footprint abundance and reading frame fidelity in a coordinated manner (Spearman's R = 0.855, Figure 2(b)).

However, the increased read peak also emerges at the same position after internal AUG codons, including the last AUG (Figure 2(c)). Therefore, this feature is unlikely due to the initiation event. Indeed, we observed the same 5\u2032 end codon preference after excluding the first 30 nt of CDS (). For many deep sequencing results, the 5\u2032 end of reads is subject to technical bias [34]. The commonly found A/T enrichment at the 5\u2032 end of reads in Ribo-seq and RNA-seq is possibly due to unequal ligation during library construction [35]. Therefore, it is possible that the overrepresentation of AUG codon at the 5\u2032 end of RPFs is a result of sequencing bias. To uncover true footprint features masked by sequencing bias, we took several independent approaches to characterizing RPFs. First, we compared ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data sets generated using the same protocol from the same cells. Indeed, RNA-seq reads exhibit an obvious A/T enrichment for the first nucleotide (). However, our Ribo-seq reads mainly start with A, but not T. Despite the common A preference for the 5\u2032 end nucleotide, RNA-seq reads exhibit poor correlation between read abundance and IFR for their 5\u2032 end codons. Therefore, although some ribosome footprints could be inflated as a result of sequencing bias, they must originally dwell in the right reading frame. Second, the high IFR values associated with certain RPFs could also be seen in the absence of cycloheximide (CHX) (), excluding the possible side effect of translation inhibitors by altering ribosomal conformations [36]. Third, we stratified RPFs based on read length and found the consistent pattern of IFR and codon coverage (). Thus, the 5\u2032 end bears reliable information in inferring ribosome positions and reading frames. Fourth, we reanalyzed a series of ribosome profiling data sets published previously by different research groups [37]. Despite the varying data quality and using different species, RPFs with certain 5\u2032 end codons are well separated in terms of IFR values (). In particular, the AUG codon clearly stands out with prominent read density and reading frame fidelity.",

A previous study using UV crosslinking reported extensive interaction between the small subunit 40S and the bound mRNA [39].

Given the highly conserved 3\u2032-terminal sequence of 18S rRNA among all eukaryotic species (), we hypothesize that the AUG-like codons of mRNAs interact with the 3\u2032-proximal CAU triplet of 18S rRNA, thereby retaining the translating ribosome. Supporting this notion, an elevated read density appears unanimously at the +12 nt position following the start site as well as internal AUG codons (Figure 2(c)). Given the 12 nt offset between the mapped P-site and the 5\u2032 end, it is likely that the ribosome pauses whenever the AUG codon reaches the mRNA exit site of the ribosome after decoding. Notably, the same feature is also evident for other AUG-like codons, such as AUC, but not non-AUG codons like GUC ().

Intriguingly, we found that the +12 nt ribosomal pausing was far from uniform, suggesting that other factors may influence the putative mRNA:rRNA interaction, such as mRNA folding, modification, or ribosome stacking. We classified all the transcripts into two groups depending on whether the +12 nt peak is above or below the average ribosome density. For messages without +12 nt ribosomal pausing, the downstream region showed a surprisingly lower average IFR value than the first 3 codons. Notably, the downstream IFR was gradually restored to the average level (Figure 3(b), right panel). However, it is possible that these transcripts contain overlapping out-of-frame ORFs in the 5\u2032-proximal region. We next compared the regional IFR before and after internal \u201csticky\u201d or \u201cnon-sticky\u201d codons. When transcripts were aligned to the second AUG (first internal AUG) codon, we observed a modest increase of IFR values averaged from the downstream region relative to the upstream (Figure 3(c), top panel).

As expected, methionine starvation potently suppressed AUG-initiated translation and gave rise to footprints with mixed reading frames ( and ), presumably due to non-AUG translation of upstream and downstream ORFs. To our surprise, in the absence of methionine, there was an outstanding ribosome pausing at the +12 nt position following the start codon as well as internal AUG codons (Figure 3(c) and ).

By contrast, when a typical \u201cnon-sticky\u201d codon GGC was chosen to align the messages, we observed a decreased IFR value for the downstream region (Figure 3(d)). Collectively, these results support the notion that mRNA:rRNA pairing during translation helps retain the ribosome in the reading frame originally set by the AUG start codon.",

Both \u201csticky\u201d and \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequences were carefully chosen to avoid AUG and stop codons in all three reading frames. By normalizing to the in-frame control, the Rluc levels in transfected cells represent the extent of corresponding FS events. Notably, the insertion of different amino acids had little effect on Rluc activities, although the presence of \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequence slightly lowered the Rluc level in the in-frame control (Figure 4(a), right panel). However, for the +1 FS reporter containing the \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequence, the Rluc level was about 4-fold higher than the \u201csticky\u201d counterpart in both HEK293 and MEF cells. Intriguingly, the marked difference seen in the +1 FS reporter was not observable in the \u20131 FS reporter. To exclude possible crypt splicing events or hidden promoters generated after insertion of extra sequences, we repeated these experiments by transfection of cells using capped mRNAs synthesized in vitro. We obtained nearly identical results in both HEK293 and MEF cells (). Our data indicate that the lack of \u201csticky\u201d codons along the coding region triggers high frequency of +1 FS events, but not \u20131 FS. This is in line with the model that mRNA:rRNA pairing serves as a \u201cbrake\u201d at the outside of the mRNA tunnel to prevent overmovement of the message during translocation.",

Constructs with frame 0 \u201csticky\u201d insert were used as control. For the +1 FS reporter, we observed negligible difference of Rluc levels in transfected cells regardless of the frames the \u201csticky\u201d sequence residing in Figure 4(b).

Once again, mRNA transfection gave rise to the similar results, confirming the reading frame-specific effects of \u201csticky\u201d sequence in driving frameshifting (). The finding that frame 2 \u201csticky\u201d sequence is easier to induce FS than the same sequence in frame 1 is surprising but consistent with the \u201cgripping\u201d model of mRNA movement imposed by mRNA:rRNA pairing (Figure 4(c)). When the AUG-like codons are present in frame 1, mRNA:rRNA pairing is less favorable than the one bearing \u201csticky\u201d codons in frame 2 ().

Instead, we used a previously described 18S rRNA expression system that has been shown to be able to incorporate the exogenously expressed 18S rRNA into ~15% of 40S subunits in transfected cells [40]. To change the base pairing between 18S rRNA and mRNA, we mutated the 3\u2032 terminal CAU triplet of 18S rRNA into GCC (Figure 5(a)).

This result further suggests that the 5\u2032 end sequence preference of RPFs does not entirely stem from technical artifacts. We examined the abundance of RPFs with specific codons at the P-site or the 5\u2032 end (). RPFs grouped by P-site codons exhibit little change of abundance in cells expressing 18S(GCC) (Figure 5(b)). Thus, the 3\u2032 tail of 18S rRNA does not influence the residence time of ribosomes during decoding. However, when the footprint 5\u2032 end codon identity was analyzed, RPFs starting with GGC-like codons showed an evident increase of abundance in cells expressing 18S(GCC). Metagene analysis of transcriptome aligned at specific codons revealed a clear switch of codon \u201cstickiness\u201d as judged by the +12 nt peak height between wild type and mutant 18S rRNA ().

The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction plays an unexpected role in reading frame fidelity and exerts a surprising reading frame-specificity. For instance, mRNA:rRNA pairing only prevents +1 FS but not \u20131 FS (Figure 4(a)). In addition, the \u201csticky\u201d sequence is rather safe in frame 1 because it does not induce +1 frameshifting errors (Figure 4(b)). Since \u201csticky\u201d codons, when present in frame 2, promote \u20131 FS by potentially reengaging ribosomes, we reasoned that AUG-like codons must be avoided in frame 2 during evolution to minimize spontaneous FS errors. We computed the codon composition in different reading frames for the entire coding region of human genome (Figure 6(a)). Intriguingly, nearly all of the ATG-like codons are kept at minimal levels in frame 2 with the ATG itself the lowest. To exclude the possibility that the codon preference in frame 2 is a result of codon selection in frame 0, we randomized whole codons while maintaining the original amino acid sequence. Remarkably, ATG and GGC codons in frame 2 of randomized sequences are clearly deviated from the same codons in human CDS (). Similar results were obtained after dinucleotide randomization. Therefore, the codon preference in frame 2 is not a consequence of codon bias that existed in frame 0. Additionally, the asymmetric distribution of \u201csticky\u201d codons among reading frames is highly conserved across different eukaryotic genomes (). These results clearly indicate that there is a universal trend of selection for low frequency of \u201csticky\u201d codons in frame 2. As a typical example, the \u03b2-actin gene ACTB showed very few \u201csticky\u201d codons in frame 2 and displayed constant ribosome occupancy along the coding region (Figure 6(b)). Interestingly, the distribution of \u201csticky\u201d codons among the reading frames of OAZ1 is not uniform (Figure 6(c)). The stop codon of OAZ1, serving as the +1 PRF site, appears to be a dividing point for \u201csticky\u201d codon composition in frame 2. Since frame 2 becomes frame 1 after +1 PRF, this result supports the view that codon optimization is highly coordinated between general coding regions and specific PRF signals.",

In general, frameshift errors are more deleterious than missense errors in protein production. While amino acid mis-incorporation is primarily monitored in the decoding center via sampling tRNAs, mechanisms controlling the step size of translocation are poorly understood. The accuracy of decoding itself, however, is insufficient to account for the high degree of reading frame fidelity in translation of long messages. For the ribosome to adhere to the correct reading frame during the entire course of translation, a retrospective fidelity check by the ribosome after translocation seems to be critical. Interestingly, in bacteria, the internal SD:anti-SD interaction is able to reposition the ribosome from frame 0 to frame 1, thereby causing +1 PRF. This feature is well documented in the prfB gene and is essential for the synthesis of full length release factor 2 (RF2) [41, 42]. Although other factors are essential in this PRF, this phenomenon suggests that mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a role in controlling translational reading frames. Analogous to prokaryotic SD:anti-SD duplex formation, eukaryotic mRNA:rRNA pairing has been reported to play a role in noncanonical translation initiation [43, 44], as well as reinitiation [45]. However, the physiological significance of mRNA:rRNA interaction during elongation remained elusive.",

            "text": "We found that the feature of mRNA:rRNA pairing plays a similar role in eukaryotic translation. Importantly, it provides a postdecoding \u201cgripping\u201d mechanism to prevent overmovement of mRNA during translocation. This notion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, the FS reporter assay showed greater than 4-fold higher frameshift errors when the mRNA:rRNA interaction is disrupted by replacing the \u201csticky\u201d codons with the \u201cnon-sticky\u201d sequence. Second, we observed a high frequency of \u20131 FS when the \u201csticky\u201d sequence was relocated from frame 0 to frame 2. Third, codon composition analysis revealed that \u201csticky\u201d codons are generally avoided in frame 2 for the majority of genes, suggesting a strong selection for codon optimization. Fourth, for genes experiencing PRF (such as OAZ1), the \u201csticky\u201d codons are clearly redistributed among different reading frames. Although the functional purpose of individual cases may differ, the advantage associated with mRNA:rRNA pairing offers a clear mechanistic view of reading frame maintenance during translation.",

            "text": "For the ribosome to achieve translational accuracy, it is conceivable that at least two types of RNA interaction occur during the course of translation: mRNA:tRNA pairing at the decoding center and mRNA:rRNA pairing at the exit tunnel of the mRNA path. While the former ensures proper mRNA decoding via tRNA sampling, the latter secures the correct reading frame via a gripping mechanism. Unlike the continuous codon:anti-codon pairing, the appearance of \u201csticky\u201d codons along the primary reading frame is periodic because the majority of 61 sense codons are \u201cnon-sticky\u201d (Figure 6(a)). How does the periodic mRNA:rRNA interaction contribute to continuous reading frame precision? We reasoned that the frame-specific effect of \u201csticky\u201d codons offers an autocorrecting mechanism to achieve retrospective fidelity control. For instance, once the \u201cnon-sticky\u201d codons reach the exit site of the mRNA path, the lack of mRNA grip may cause a higher chance of +1 FS (Figure 4(a)). However, the recurrence of the next \u201csticky\u201d codons in frame 0 (now becomes frame 2 after +1 FS) has the potential to induce \u20131 FS (Figure 4(b)), which ultimately cancels the original +1 FS. Therefore, the periodic presence of \u201csticky\u201d codons is able to maintain reading frame accuracy via self-guard and autocorrection. The remarkable reading frame fidelity is well reflected by the fact that the majority of transcripts have minimal ribosome drop-off during translation (Figure 1(c)).",

            "text": "It is intriguing that the eukaryotic mRNA:rRNA pairing is centered on AUG, a codon essentially selected for initiation. For any given transcript, it is the position of the start codon that defines the corresponding open reading frame. Despite the codon degeneracy, it is puzzling that the start codon AUG is shared with the internal methionine codon. Since the AUG codon is complementary to the CAU triplet at the 3\u2032 end of 18S rRNA, it is tempting to speculate that its \u201cstickiness\u201d helps retain the translation machinery in the reading frame originally set by AUG. Robustness to frameshift errors is likely an inherent constraint on the early genetic code. As a result, selection of AUG as a start codon lowers the fitness cost by minimizing frameshifting errors. Notably, recent development of initiating ribosome profiling in eukaryotes revealed prevalence of non-AUG start codons in eukaryotes [32, 46, 47]. Notably, the majority of those non-canonical initiators belong to AUG-like codons, which bear similar \u201cstickiness\u201d as AUG in mediating mRNA:rRNA pairing. Additionally, the highly conserved 3\u2032 end of 18S rRNA has been found to be heavily modified in both precursor and mature forms [48]. The critical role of differential nucleotide modification in mRNA:rRNA interaction awaits further investigation. It is possible that the ribosome serves as a molecular selector by employing mRNA:rRNA interaction to shape the evolution of the start codon as well as codon optimization in the coding region.",
