In China during 2010 and 2011, over one million nursing piglets were lost due to PEDV-associated diarrhoea [4]; in 2013, PEDV emerged in Korea and the USA [5\u20137] as well as in Taiwan [8], causing great economic losses and continuing to spread as an epidemic.",

The PEDV genome consists of a positive single-stranded RNA approximately 28 kb in length that contains 7 open reading frames (ORF), including ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6 [9]. The viral particles are coated with S-protein, a type I membrane protein. The protein forms spikes on the viral surface that are used to infect host cells and also bears highly antigenic domains and could theoretically be used to develop a high-titre neutralizing PEDV vaccine [6, 10]. However, Sun et al. [11] found that the sequence of this region is highly variable, a characteristic that is likely to reduce the efficiency of conventional commercial vaccines. Furthermore, the S-protein is a glycoprotein that undergoes complicated post-translational modifications that result in antigen diversity and create obstacles to the development of a PEDV vaccine [10].",

            "text": "The pathway of PEDV infection occurs mainly through the S-protein. PEDV first contacts sialic acids (neuraminic acid, NA) in host intestine [12] and then infects the villi by binding to aminopeptidase N (APN) on epithelial cells [13, 14]. These findings suggest that NA is the first glycoprotein receptor and that APN is the second one for PEDV during infection of the host intestine [15]. A similar process occurs during infection by TGEV [12]; on the other hand, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) loses its ability to infect the host intestine due to mutation and deletion of the S-protein genomic region occur [16]. Since viral genomic sequences of S-protein are generally variable and unstable, but in mammals, e.g., pigs, the codon sequences of their receptor are more stable and allow to be manipulated specifically by gene editing (GE). As mentioned above, PEDV infects the host via NA and APN, and NA has been shown to play an important role in host immune function and infection by pathogens [17, 18]. Human cells synthesize N-acetyl NA (NANA) but not N-glycolyl NA (NGNA), due to CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) insert an oxygen into the acetyl group of NANA converted to the glycolyl of NGNA [19] and the human CMAH gene has mutated during 2.5\u20133.0 million years of evolution [17]. We suggest that, analogous to the way in which human evolution has eliminated the NGNA receptor for PEDV, the CMAH gene of domestic pigs might be artificially mutated by gene editing technology to produce resistance to PEDV infection. The APN gene is not proposed as a target because it is essential for dipeptide digestion and amino acid absorption.",

Due to the availability of convenient techniques for constructing and editing vectors and the fact that Cas9 is a universal enzyme that can be constructed separately to guide/target vectors, use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for GE is currently more popular than use of the ZFN and TALEN systems. Furthermore, GE can be simultaneously conducted on multiple sites or genes with the same Cas9 to achieve different targeting purposes or reduce the risks of off-targeting [23\u201325]. We have established TALEN [26] and CRISPR/Cas9 [27, 28] systems for direct microinjection of GE vectors to generate \u03b11, 3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) mutant pigs. In this study, direct microinjection of two single-guide RNA and Cas9 mRNA vectors into the cytoplasm of pronuclear porcine embryos was used to generate CMAH mutant pigs with null expression of NGNA, and the possibility of obtaining mutant piglets that are resistant to infection by PEDV was examined.",

Therefore, at that stage, the percentage of IF-positive cells was the only criterion used to determine the severity of PEDV infection. However, in the middle to late stages of infection, the severity of PEDV infection is better judged by the degree of villar atrophy because infected cells often defoliate from the mucosa and IF may not reveal the PEDV-infected cells.

The efficiency of gene editing and KO was 7.5% based on the number of manipulated embryos and 83.3% based on the number of delivered piglets, all of which were biallelic mutants (Table 2).",

Grossly, the small intestine appeared transparent and orange-yellow to flesh pink in colour; it was thin-walled and dilated with fluid content in the live piglets (S6A and S6B Fig). In exp. I, the PEDV induced histopathologic changes, including enterocyte necrosis, degeneration, and exfoliation, and collapsed lamina proprial tissues containing karyorrhectic debris, were noted in all challenged piglets. However, these lesions varied from mild to severe, and the lesions were more severe in the moribund WT piglets than in the CMAH KO piglets (Fig 8). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining with a monoclonal antibody against PEDV nuclear protein was used to detect PEDV antigens. The results showed that PEDV antigen was presented in the epithelium covering the moderately atrophic tips of villi in the small intestine of WT and CMAH KO piglets (Fig 9). However, if the epithelial cells were defoliated from the villi after PEDV infection, no positive signals would be expected (Fig 9A). We further scored the severity of lesions in the intestines of the infected animals (Fig 2) by a combination of IF staining and histopathological inspection (immuno/histopathological, I/H, score). According to I/H scores, results revealed that the severity of the intestinal lesions in KO piglets (3.7\u00b10.3 to 4.2\u00b10.2) less than those in WT piglets (4.8\u00b10.2) (p<0.05) in exp.

III, even ruling out the possible effects of feeding the animals with commercial baby cow milk, we also found no significant difference in I/H scores of WT and CMAH KO piglets (Table 8). According to the I/H scores obtained at 72 hpi, which ranged from 3.8\u00b10.4 to 3.2\u00b10.5 in CMAH KO piglets and from 2.8\u00b10.4 to 2.5\u00b10.2 in WT piglets (p>0.05), most piglets seemed to improve compared with those at 24 and 48 hpi when offered sow\u2019s milk and supplemental lactated Ringer\u2019s solution containing 5% glucose (Table 8).",

I, 2-day-old old piglets were orally inoculated with the local outbreak strain nv-PEDV [31]. Although the final (72 hpi) survival rate differed little in the WT and KO animals, based on the histopathologic examination and considering the 3 deadly moribund WT piglets, the CMAH KO piglets showed greater resistance to nv-PEDV infection than the WT animals. This assumption is supported by the high degree of histopathologic severity found in the WT piglets, which clearly differed from that observed in the CMAH KO piglets. However, when 3-day-old piglets were used, no differences between CMAH KO and WT piglets were observed. It is doubtful that the NGNA present in cow\u2019s milk-based formula would enable the virus to infect the CMAH KO piglets. In exp. III, colostrum from the KO or WT sows was given to avoid any possible NGNA inference, yet the final susceptibilities of the two genotypes were similar, due to no or little NGNA (S7 Fig). However, at least 3 of the 11 CMAH KO piglets showed normal activity and no clinical signs (no vomiting or diarrhoea) at 12 hpi, whereas the WT piglets displayed vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Lessened severity was therefore observed.",

Recently, the domain VII of APN was suggested to play a critical role for PEDV binding [40]; yet, when the ANPEP (APN) was null mutated by using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, the KO piglets though not infected by TGEV but still vulnerable to PEDV [41]. We found the major components of porcine mucin in the small intestinal submucosa are two types of NA, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) (unpublished data). Using a glycan screening array, Liu et al. [42] showed that Neu5Ac (or NANA) has the highest binding affinity for PEDV S1-NTD-CTD; however, they also found that porcine mucin or bovine mucin could inhibit or block in vitro PEDV and TGEV infection of PK-15 or Huh-7 cells which transfected with porcine APN. The present results show that CMAH KO piglets exhibited delayed infection and minor symptoms after oral PEDV inoculation, suggesting that in CMAH KO piglets that are normally nursed, PEDV may be unable to bind efficiently to the APN on the villi of epithelial cells and pass through the intestinal lumen. The infection of virus via receptor could be the sole route for PRRSV [35\u201337] and TGEV [12,15,41], but not true for PEDV, might be through a more complicate mechanism other than receptors [43].",

            "text": "It is known that PEDV causes severe enteric disease in suckling piglets [44,45] and less severe disease in older weaned pigs [46]. Our results suggest that the differentiation might occur as early as in the neonatal period; clinical diarrhoea and/or vomiting and decreased activity were observed in all 2-day-old piglets but improved in 3-day-old piglets. When caesarean-delivered and colostrum-deprived (CDCD) animals were used for oral inoculation of PEDV, the 1-day-old piglets showed clinical signs at 12 hpi [47]; this was also observed in our study using naturally delivered piglets. Furthermore, in PEDV inoculation studies, 5-day-old CDCD piglets were more sensitive than 21-day-old weaned piglets [32]. Similarly, naturally delivered 9-day-old suckling piglets showed a weaker innate immune response to PEDV than weaned pigs [48]. This study used 2- or 3-day-old piglets that were naturally delivered and nursed with colostrum by CMAH KO or WT sows prior to PEDV oral inoculation in an attempt to realize the protective effects of nursing in animals in which the biallelic CMAH genes were mutated. In exp. III, the clinical symptoms of 2-day-old piglets that were PEDV inoculated and hand fed whole or skim sow\u2019s milk for an additional 24 h were similar to those of the 3-day-old piglets in exp. II. Furthermore, when lactated Ringer\u2019s solution supplemented with 5% glucose was offered from 24 to 72 hpi, the epithelial cells of the villi showed less damage and/or showed increased recovery of epithelial cells from the crypts according to the I/H scores, which ranged from 4.0 \u00b1 0.0 to 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 in WT piglets and from 5.0 \u00b1 0.0 to 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 in the KO group. This benefit of oral rehydration therapy in acute viral diarrhoea could be attributed to glucose-facilitated sodium absorption [49] and to alleviate Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase damage [50]. Currently, the model may be improved by inoculating the piglets and allowed them to be continually nursed by dams of the same genotype to avoid NGNA interference.",
