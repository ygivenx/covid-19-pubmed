Guidance has been developed for clinical triage of patients with ILI, including special populations (e.g. children, pregnant women), during a pandemic [10]\u2013[12]. A key clinical decision is determining which ill persons can be managed as outpatients and which require hospitalization. Scoring systems, with varying predictive power, have been developed to determine who will require hospitalization, need ICU care, require a ventilator, or is at high risk of death (e.g. CURB-65)[13]\u2013[15].",

Overwhelming demand for medical care by patients with ILI and limited availability of oseltamivir necessitated that clinicians rapidly triage patients for outpatient care or hospital admission. These challenges are compounded by the need for early oseltamivir treatment of influenza patients for optimal efficacy [17]. At the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Fray Antonio Alcalde (HCGFAA), Mexico, clinicians from the Adult Infectious Diseases Unit used a modified ILI scoring system to systematically triage adult patients with respiratory complaints and determine who would be prioritized for hospitalization and antivirals. We describe this triaging system during the peak 2009 pandemic in Guadalajara (April\u2013August, 2009).",

In response to high demand for emergency medical services among adult patients with acute respiratory complaints, infectious disease specialists implemented an ILI scoring system on April 25, 2009. This scoring system was adapted from a system developed by Hak et al in the United States for hospitalization decision-making among elderly patients with pneumonia or influenza during influenza epidemics [18]. In the emergency room (ER), a questionnaire was used to record patients' demographics, signs and symptoms, history of health care utilization, chronic medical conditions, laboratory, and radiology findings to calculate patients' ILI-scores (Figure 1). Clinicians used an ILI-score \u226516 (high-risk), their judgment of patients' severity of illness and proximity to the hospital to decided whether to admit the patient and treat them with oseltamivir. Patients with intermediate ILI-scores (7\u201315) were discharged from the ER, treated with oseltamivir and followed daily by phone for 10 days. Those with low ILI-scores (\u22646) were discharged without antiviral treatment, and instructed to return if their symptoms worsened.",

The triage system was based on assumptions about who is at risk for developing complications from seasonal influenza (e.g. patients aged over 65 years). Our analyses, however, suggested that patients infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) tended to be younger than seasonal influenza A patients. Nevertheless, our data suggest that clinicians used the ILI-score to help them determine, with minimal misclassification, which patients needed hospitalization versus who could be managed as outpatients [18]. The ILI-score helped guide clinicians to decide who needed hospital care and antiviral treatment when timely laboratory confirmation of influenza was not available. Only 1% of patients triaged needed re-evaluation. Such a system could be readily used to efficiently triage patients during outbreaks and epidemics by adapting the system's scores to match the anticipated characteristics of patients who are at highest risk of developing complications.",

The age shift in 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) cases may be caused by cross-reactive immunity from prior influenza infections in 33% of those aged more than 60 years [22], [23]. Health officials should adjust pandemic triaging tools to account for the younger age distribution of cases [24]. Pregnancy should also be included as a risk factor in triaging tools.

Nevertheless, such a triaging system can help guide the clinical management of patients presenting to the ED with acute respiratory illness in settings that lack timely diagnostic testing and have limited antivirals supplies. With some adaptation, the system may be especially useful in resource-poor countries, during the peak of pandemic influenza, or during other respiratory virus activity. Although no scoring system will replace clinical judgment, our experience suggests that the triaging system may have helped clinicians effectively triage patients and determine who needed hospital care and who could be managed as outpatients. The triaging system and the ILI-score should be modified to the local 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) situation based upon hospital surge capacity, antiviral susceptibilities and supply, and the evolving epidemiology of this virus.",
