Owing to the complexity of the constituents in TCMs, reductionism, which individually considers each ingredient, cannot adequately explain the effects generated by an entire formula, and therefore faces several challenges comprehending and illustrating the mechanisms of herbal formulas. With the rapid development of bioinformatics, a combined attempt based on system/network biology and polypharmacology has created a new paradigm called network pharmacology (NP).",

The rapid development of bioinformatics and computational sciences has provided a wide range of approaches for targets prediction of small molecules24. In this study, the putative targets of compounds were identified based on the similarity ensemble approach (SEA: http://sea.bkslab.org/)25. The potential targets of 250 compounds were successfully predicted by the SEA, with a total of 968 protein targets. (A worth-mentioning issue is about the high amount of 968 potential \u201ctargets\u201d of YPF decoction, especially in terms of the relative small target pool of SEA. We tried to narrow the scope of potential \u201ctargets\u201d of YPF decoction by setting up a pre-enrichment filter based on Tc threshold value. In this way, the number of \u201ctargets\u201d for enrichment analysis sharply decreases from 968 to 304. However, the results of the most-important potential therapeutic targets and potential active compounds of YPF have no obvious changes. Thus, we still chose the post-enrichment filtering strategy, considering the advantage of this strategy with more informative reference to alternative targets. Throughout this paper, the term \u201ctargets\u201d refers to the putative proteins to which the ingredients from YPF decoction directly bind, according to SEA predictions; however, it is not known whether targets are responsible for the therapeutic effect of YPF decoction. The term \u201ctherapeutic targets\u201d refers to partial proteins from targets that have been identified to be responsible for the therapeutic effect of YPF decoction by our novel NP-based method.) Then, the target\u2013pathway interactions were generated to elucidate the biological pathways that YPF decoction might impact; moreover, the overrepresented KEGG pathways of the predicted 968 protein targets of YPF were identified from enrichment analysis. A total of 132 highly related pathways with 549 relevant protein targets were obtained.

The nodes represent putative targets of YPF (orange), relevant pathways (light blue), and diseases (deep purple). From Fig. 2(a), it is difficult to determine which targets might be most relevant to the therapeutic effect that YPF exerts; therefore, the novel TPT network was established to realise the recognition of therapeutic-based targets of YPF decoction, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Eight modules (modules 1\u20138) were detected and divided by the Louvain algorithm incorporated in the Gephi software at a resolution of 1.032,33. According to graph theory, the TPT network shown in Fig. 2(b) suggests some significant structural information, especially when considering the relatively separated modules with dense internal connections. Then, the inner interactions (edges representing the common pathways between every two nodes) of each target module were further investigated.",

The following centrality analysis was conducted to evaluate the importance of the targets (nodes) within the therapeutic targets module from the perspective of the topological analysis of the TPT network. Four centrality indicators, i.e., degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, were used to measure the importance of the targets (nodes) from the different perspectives55\u201357. Then, an integrated indicator, namely target importance (TI), was calculated accordingly. Next, the top 10% therapeutic targets by TI were selected and recommended for further pharmacology study in the context of the mechanism illustration of YPF decoction. From a holistic perspective, YPF might interfere with targets in module 7 in a synergistic way, some of which (with higher centrality), as illustrated in Table 3, can be considered to be the most potential therapeutic targets of YPF. Moreover, the compounds relevant to these targets according to the SEA prediction can be recommended as potential active ingredients in YPF decoction in Table 3.",

The modules in the TPT network with a similar function, especially coinciding with the already known application of YPF decoction, were inferred from the finding that the protein targets in module 7 were highly associated with the underlying mechanism of YPF decoction, especially those with highest centrality as presented in Table 3. Additionally, some of these targets have been reported to be relevant to the therapeutic activity that YPF might exert. Herein, the network-based method provided an easier and more reliable strategy for uncovering the potential therapeutic targets of YPF.",
