The 2014 West African outbreak\u2014first reported in Guinea and subsequently becoming established in Liberia and Sierra Leone\u2014is the largest to date. Symptoms of EVD include vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhaging, and transmission occurs via direct contact with blood and other bodily fluids. It is characterised by an incubation period of up to three weeks during which onward transmission is unlikely, followed by increasingly severe symptoms and associated infectiousness. Case fatality rates are high, and improperly buried bodies represent an ongoing source of infection [15]. In the absence of widely available pharmaceutical measures for treatment or prevention during the 2014 West African outbreak, control efforts centred around identification and isolation of cases, tracing of known contacts, and hygienic burial of people who died from EVD.",

Health care workers were disproportionately represented among cases and the full costs of the outbreak in terms of the impact on health infrastructure are still being realised [2].

In September 2014, WHO regional offices undertook a rapid assessment of EVD virus preparedness across countries in the region, followed by a simulation exercise to train public health staff. A risk assessment for EVD infection in the region was undertaken using the WHO guidance for rapid risk assessment of acute public health events [14].

Uncertainties in current knowledge can be incorporated into parameter estimates, and can help to provide estimates of the risk of various possible outcomes [24\u201326].

We also assumed a (modest) national contact-tracing capacity of 100 contacts per day. We allocated national hospital beds to Port Moresby and distributed remaining beds (regional and provincial hospitals) among the administrative regions in proportion to their population densities, as a proxy for both population size and health care system accessibility. The health care workforce and contact-tracing capacity were allocated among regions in proportion to their designated bed capacities. From these data, we estimate that the Port Moresby region has a medium health care system (almost 0.2% of the population are health care workers), that the Islands region has a small health care system (almost 0.1% are health care workers), and the remaining regions have even less health care infrastructure.",

Papua New Guinea has a low HDI ranking similar to those of the West African nations, and faces similar challenges in providing access to and quality of health care services. These challenges include: very few health professionals (less than 1 doctor per 10,000 people), insufficient health workforce in rural areas (more than 80% of medical officers work in urban areas, despite 87.5% of the population living in rural areas), low levels of workforce retention in rural areas (due to remoteness, financial instability, and dangerous environments), limited availability of basic essential medical supplies, and lack of access to clean water in many facilities [45]. Given these issues of access and provision, we assumed that case ascertainment in Papua New Guinea was unlikely to be higher than in the West African outbreak (40\u201350%) and, particularly in rural areas, might be substantially lower (10\u201320%).",

In these rural settings, behavioural interventions can greatly increase the likelihood of controlling outbreaks even when case ascertainment is very low, and the synergistic effects of reducing transmission in the community and also from dead bodies can avoid uncontrolled outbreaks altogether.

We have also shown that, in specific settings (such as the Papua New Guinea case study), the relative merits of different resourcing strategies may shift. For example, sensitivity analyses for the rural regions of PNG indicated that interventions targeting behavioural change, such as changes to burial practices, consistently improve controllability. However, providing extra hospital beds alone is unlikely to confer substantial benefits because the limiting factor is case ascertainment rather than treatment and isolation of cases. These observations are of course specific to this population and health care system context, and a strength of this framework is the ability to tailor intervention priorities to specific local context.",

For comparison against these scenarios, a set of simulations with no health care response should be generated to form a baseline.",

Communication of key model outcomes to policy makers and local health care providers must be both accurate and comprehensible. Given the considerable uncertainty around model inputs in data-poor settings, it is important that specific quantitative outputs are not \u2018over-interpreted\u2019. For example, projections of cumulative cases are unlikely to be realised given both initial uncertainty, and the evolving nature of the local and international response and intervention. We therefore advocate focusing on qualitative measures of control and burden that can inform estimates of comparative, rather than absolute, impact. Our classification of outbreaks as either controlled or uncontrolled was appropriate in the case of EVD, since there was a clear division between epidemic sizes. It is possible that further distinctions may be required in other scenarios.",
