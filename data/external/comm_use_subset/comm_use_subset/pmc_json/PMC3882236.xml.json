            "text": "Hepatitis C is a major public health problem worldwide. More than 70% of infected people fail to clear the virus during the acute phase of the disease and become chronic carriers [1]. Liver cirrhosis, which develops in about 10 to 20% of chronically infected patients, is linked with a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in later life [2]. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related end stage liver disease is the leading reason for liver transplantation in the United States [1]. For many years, the standard therapy for hepatitis C consisted of a regimen of pegylated alpha interferon and ribavirin, but showed limited success depending on the viral genotype. This antiviral drug therapy has recently been augmented with the FDA approval of two HCV-specific protease inhibitors, boceprivir and telaprevir. The new drug combination achieved sustained virologic response rates of close to 70% in HCV genotype 1-infected patients in clinical trials [3]. While this new treatment promises a higher cure rate especially for difficult-to-treat HCV genotype 1 infections, the high cost of drug therapy in general still makes this option unaffordable in developing countries. The development of a safe and effective HCV vaccine remains an important goal for the global control of HCV infections. The understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections thus becomes a potentially key step toward the vaccine design.",

Overcoming the variability may require the production of specific antibodies that are broadly neutralizing. The HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 has long been considered as an important immunogenic target in efforts to generate a protective immunity. This consideration is largely based on the role of the E2 protein in facilitating the entry of HCV into hepatocytes via interaction, in particular, with the host entry factor CD81 [6]\u2013[8], [27].",

A series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments was carried out to generate two types of variations on the backbone of the E2 protein of the H77 strain (Fig 6A).

Indeed, either S528N or S528T substitutions, which could be seen, respectively, in 42.80% and 20.84% of the HCV strains (n = 1958), did not affect the CD81 binding, although these replacements reduced the binding of 1H8 in the Western blot (Fig 6C).

            "text": "A successful vaccine relies often on its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies in humans. Paradoxically, during the natural course of HCV infection, neutralizing antibodies are rarely detectable at the early stage of the infection, and if detectable, these antibodies are essentially ineffective in vivo, in spite of their neutralizing activity being demonstrated in vitro\n[16]\u2013[17]. As a consequence, patients establish persistent HCV infections even in the presence of appreciable amounts of neutralizing antibodies [9]. Additionally, it has been observed that HCV variants that re-infect the grafted livers of transplant patients are poorly neutralized by antibodies that were present in pre-transplant plasma. In contrast, the viral variants that could no longer be detected following transplantation are efficiently neutralized [18]. These observations support the hypothesis that the profile of antibodies elicited by the virus over the natural course of a patient\u2019s HCV infection, in combination with the high mutation rate of the virus, determines the ultimate pattern of humoral immunity [9]. In the majority of cases the result is that virus-specific neutralizing antibody responses occur too late (or neutralizing antibodies are produced in insufficient amounts) to halt the infection. In line with this thinking, a comprehensive study of clinical samples collected after a single-source outbreak of hepatitis C has shown that neutralizing antibodies produced early in the infection play an important role in the clearance of HCV, thus avoiding chronicity [16].",

            "text": "The genetic diversity of HCV has posed a great challenge to the generation of antibodies capable of neutralizing the various HCV genotypes. With at least six distinct genotypes, HCV exhibits extensive variability, particularly within the envelope genes, which differ by approximately 30% at the nucleotide level [19]\u2013[20]. Even within a single infected individual, HCV may exist as a complex population of genetically distinct variants, termed quasispecies [21]\u2013[22]. Therefore, the conserved residues in the E2 protein that are directly involved in CD81-mediated virus entry would be reasonable targets to elicit neutralizing antibodies. Antibody blocking experiments have indeed shown that several regions of the E2 protein are critical for CD81 binding [6], [23]\u2013[26]. However, because some of the antibodies used in these experiments are conformation-sensitive, it is difficult to confirm whether some of the observed inhibitory effects on the interaction between the E2 protein and CD81 resulted directly from blocking the CD81 binding site of the E2 protein or from antibody-mediated steric hindrance. Despite this difficulty, the majority of the broadly neutralizing conformation-sensitive antibodies reported so far, including those isolated from humans, appear to recognize highly conserved E2 residues, such as W420, Y527, W529, G530, and D535, that are critical for CD81 binding [23]\u2013[24], [27]\u2013[34]. In particular, substitutions at positions 523 and 530 with alanine showed that these two residues, while being a part of the CD81 binding site of the E2 [27], were also important for the neutralization of HCV by several antibodies [32]. Our observation is consistent with previous findings by others who used human monoclonal antibodies and determined that the two conserved residues Y527 and W529 are the antibody contacts of the conformational epitope and are important for the CD81-E2 interaction [27]\u2013[30]. In addition, we further demonstrated that naturally occurring amino acid variations appeared in this linear epitope, such as valine at position 524, and asparagine or threonine at position 528 of the E2 protein may represent a potential mechanism for HCV to escape the 1H8-mediated neutralization. Selectively incorporating certain highly conserved residues, such as Y527 and W529, into this short linear epitope of 1H8, as previously suggested by others and confirmed by us in this study, while taking the variant residues, e.g., V524 and N528 or T528, into consideration for their escape potential, might be worthwhile to explore in order to advance the discovery of an immunogen that will effectively produce neutralizing antibodies against HCV infections.",

We observed a delayed production of \u201c1H8-like\u201d neutralizing antibody during HCV infection. The weak neutralizing antibody response to E2 protein in chronically infected patients was previously reported by others [9], [35]. At present, we do not know the reason for the delay in \u201c1H8-like\u201d neutralizing antibody production. We speculate that the tertiary structure of viral proteins presented on the surface of the virion, because of the interaction between E1 and E2 as heterodimers, for instance, may prevent the exposure of critical residues necessary for \u201c1H8-like\u201d antibody production in the early phase of infection. Another possibility is that escape variants may be rapidly accumulating in patients at the acute phase of HCV infection which could lead to the failure of any antibody response directed at this epitope. According to our model, some HCV variants, irrelevant to their genotypes, may be able to escape from \u201c1H8-like\u201d antibody-mediated neutralization during the course of natural infections, if the substituted residues in the E2 protein, as changes of alanine to valine at position 524, and serine to asparagine or threonine at position 528, are associated only with antibody recognition without affecting E2-CD81 interaction. We plan to perform a series of experiments in an animal model to systematically investigate if the antibodies elicited after immunization with peptides containing specific substitutions could affect the infectivity of the virus and the breadth of \u201c1H8-like\u201d antibody-mediated neutralization.",
