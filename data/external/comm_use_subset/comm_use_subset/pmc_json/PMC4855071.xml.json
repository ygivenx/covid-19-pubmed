Its initial use as a vaccination platform generated great excitement due to the overall simplicity of using DNA plasmids to deliver immunogens.2, 3, 4, 5 One particularly attractive feature of DNA vaccines is that immunogens are produced in vivo, giving them the ability to induce T-cell immune responses through endogenous antigen processing and presentation pathways. However, the application of DNA immunization for human vaccine development has encountered challenges, specifically the low immunogenicity identified in early clinical studies, in which DNA vaccines were delivered via traditional needle injection without the use of adjuvants or other types of delivery instruments.",

The DNA immunization approach can circumvent these problems because full-length proteins can be expressed in vivo when they are delivered in the form of DNA vaccines. Furthermore, it is well known that the structural integrity of proteins is critical for the induction of functional mAbs, yet these sensitive structures tend to be lost during the in vitro protein production process, regardless of whether they are produced as recombinant proteins or are extracted directly from cells or other sources in which the proteins are naturally expressed. Production of functionally active mAbs is highly dependent on the conformation of the proteins. Expressing intact immunogens in vivo by DNA immunization appears to have the best chance of inducing mAbs with the desired biological activities.",

            "text": "DNA vaccines possess the unique advantage of immunogen design flexibility. Immunogen inserts expressing the full-length sequences of target proteins are commonly used for all types of proteins, especially transmembrane proteins, with good success.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 For intracellular proteins, one may assume that it is necessary to re-direct intracellular proteins into secretory pathways by adding a signal peptide to elicit a better antibody response. However, in a number of mAb production studies, native proteins have been used as DNA vaccine immunogen inserts without any sequence modifications.25, 28, 31, 32 On the other hand, the gene sequences of immunogen inserts for DNA vaccines can be easily edited to express \u2018designer proteins.' For a single-transmembrane protein, the extracellular domain of a secretory protein can be selectively cloned as the immunogen insert when the objective is to generate mAbs against epitopes on the extracellular domain.33, 34, 35, 36, 37 Such an approach has also been applied to bacterial toxins. For example, a truncated fragment can be used for immunization in place of a full-length potentially lethal toxin protein, thereby avoiding the introduction of unwanted biological activity during the production of DNA vaccines, as well as during animal immunization.38, 39 Additional immunogen manipulations include the production of a \u2018mini-gene insert' to express a short peptide sequence to cover a receptor-binding domain.40 In this case, antigenic determinants in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome spike protein, which does not closely match other coronaviruses, were predicted using software PROTEAN to induce anti-spike protein antibodies. Alternatively, a transmembrane anchor sequence can be added to non-membrane-associated antigens.41 As a simple and flexible immunogen design approach, DNA immunization offers a wide range of options to produce novel immunogen inserts for the induction of mAbs against even the most challenging targets (Table 1).",

In one study of antibody generation via intravenous delivery of plasmid DNA,25 the relative efficacy of CMV promoter and the human ubiquitin C promoter was compared using luciferase as the model immunogen. Using the ubiquitin promoter, which can lead to sustained antigen expression in the liver, resulted in significant levels of antibody titers seven weeks after a single hydrodynamic tail vein (HTV) delivery. In contrast, a single HTV delivery of the CMV promoter, which results in only short-term antigen expression, produced very low antibody titers over the same time frame. Nevertheless, both promoters enabled high antibody titers when delivered repeatedly. Thus, the study authors concluded that the choice of expression vector may reduce the number of genetic immunizations while still promoting the induction of high-titer antigen-specific antibodies.",

One is traditional needle injection of DNA plasmids in various solutions. Additional facilitating agents such as lipids and nanoparticles can be included in the solution to enhance delivery efficacy, and the composition of the chemical solution determines the uptake efficacy of the DNA vaccine plasmid. The second delivery type is based on physical forces. The most representative approach is the use of a gene gun, which uses a \u2018ballistic' force to deliver the DNA plasmids. First, the DNA plasmids are coupled with gold particles, which are then delivered by the ballistic force to penetrate the cells of the targeted tissues. Early generation gene guns created ballistic forces by adding high-voltage electricity to a drop of water.60 More recent generation gene guns are based on the release of compressed gas.61, 62 Another physical method of DNA delivery is the use of electroporation. In this approach, DNA vaccines are first delivered by needle injection, followed by the application of an electrical current at the DNA injection site.",

This approach was also more effective than intramuscular needle injection alone when the DNA vaccine was formulated with a chemical polymer and protein immunogen.63 In a more complete analysis comparing the delivery of DNA vaccines by intramuscular needle injection, electroporation following intramuscular needle injection, and gene gun alone, it was shown that both gene gun and electroporation delivery were more effective than the traditional intramuscular needle injection at eliciting higher antibody response levels.64 Both the gene gun and electroporation approaches are effective, but the gene gun approach requires only a few micrograms of DNA plasmid to achieve the same level of immune response elicited by the electroporation approach, which requires at least 100 \u03bcg of DNA plasmid at the first step of intramuscular injection, even in mice.",

For example, it is not clear whether physical delivery approaches (that is, gene gun or electroporation) can be used more frequently than chemical delivery approaches (such as needle injection) because the former is more effective than the latter.",

Co-injection of plasmids that expressed ETAR and GroEL (ETAR+GroEL) induced lower antibody responses than the ETAR\u2013GroEL plasmid. In contrast, no specific antibody responses were produced in mice that were immunized with ETAR.65 The authors also mentioned that this strategy has been successfully applied to other GPCR targets and suggested that GroEL will be capable of producing antibodies against most GPCRs. One caution raised by the author is that in the case of unstable GPCRs, co-immunization with GroEL may be preferable to fusion with GroEL to induce an antibody response because fusion of some carrier proteins decreases their expression. Functional mAbs against a different GPCR target, the chemoCentryx chemokine receptor (CCX-CKR), were generated by the co-immunization of a plasmid encoding GroEL with a DNA vaccine plasmid-encoding target.27",

In this approach, the DNA vaccine is delivered as the priming immunization, followed by a boost with protein antigens as recombinant proteins, peptides, or traditional inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. One unexpected finding regarding DNA priming immunization is their ability to induce higher-level antigen-specific B-cell responses.66 Our research group has shown that DNA primer immunization was more effective than protein immunization in activating germinal center B cells. Higher levels of antigen-specific B cells set the stage for more robust antibody responses. Whether this higher-level activation of B cells leads to better mAb cloning remains to be determined.",
