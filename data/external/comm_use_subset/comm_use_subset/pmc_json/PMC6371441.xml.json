IB affects chickens of all ages and based on the organ system affected the disease is manifested in three major clinical forms\u2014respiratory, renal and reproductive. IB causes great economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide [1, 2]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The viral genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of about 27.6 Kb in length [3]. The 5\u2032-two-third of the viral genome codes for the non-structural proteins responsible for RNA replication and transcription.

It is present as trimers on the surface of the virion and contains conformation dependent epitopes [4]. The S protein is cleaved post-translationally by host cell proteases into S1 (N-terminal, globular head domain) and S2 (C-terminal, stalk domain) subunits [5\u20137]. The S1 subunit is the most variable subunit that harbors the major neutralizing epitopes [8, 9] and the receptor binding domain (RBD) responsible for viral attachment and tissue tropism [5]. The S2 subunit is the most conserved subunit and is involved in mediating membrane fusion and viral entry [5]. The S2 protein also contains minor neutralizing epitopes and contributes to the avidity of S1 protein [10]. It has been shown that a tyrosine motif located in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein is responsible for the intracellular retention [11]. This tyrosine residue is essential for productive virus infection [12]. However, the role of this tyrosine residue on induction of protective immune response by IBV S protein has not been studied.",

In the first recombinant, rLaSota/wt.S, the full chicken-codon-optimized sequence of the IBV S gene without any modification was inserted. In the second recombinant, rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct12, the tyrosine residue present at position 1145 of the IBV S protein was mutated to Alanine (Y1145A) by PCR mutagenesis and the modified S gene was fused to the last 12 amino acids of NDV fusion (F) protein cytoplasmic domain using overlap PCR. In the third recombinant, rLaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct12, the cytoplasmic tail of the IBV S gene was replaced by the last 12 amino acids of NDV fusion protein using fusion PCR technique. All the three forms of the IBV S gene were inserted as an independent transcription cassette flanked by the gene-start (GS) and gene-end (GE) sequences of the NDV and the \u201crule of six\u201d was ensured in the final length of the recombinant NDV genome for efficient replication [42]. Briefly, the codon-optimized IBV S gene\u2014preceded with GE, intergenic sequence (IGS), GS and Kozak sequences, and flanked by PmeI sites\u2014was synthesized and cloned in pUC57 (pUC57-CO.S) by GenScript\u00ae (Additional file 1A). To construct rLaSota/wt.S, pUC57-CO.S was digested with PmeI (NEB), and the released insert was gel purified and ligated into full-length rLaSota clone which was predigested by PmeI and dephosphorylated by thermostable shrimp alkaline phosphatase (TSAP) (Promega). To construct rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct12, primer sets (1 and 2) and (3 and 4) were used to induce the \u201cY1145A-mutation\u201d and add the last 12 aa of NDV F protein using pUC57-CO.S as template (Table 1). The two PCR products were then fused using primers (1 and 4) by fusion PCR. The fused PCR product was then digested by SmaI and StuI (NEB), and ligated into pUC57-CO.S which was predigested by SmaI and by StuI, its sequence is naturally present downstream to the S gene, to create pUC57-CO.S(Y1145A) + Fct12 (Additional file 1B). To construct rLaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct12, primer set (1 and 5) was used to replace the cytoplasmic tail of IBV S protein by the last 12 aa of NDV F protein using pUC57-CO.S as template. The PCR product was then digested by SmaI and StuI and ligated into pUC57-CO.S which is predigested by SmaI and StuI to create pUC57-CO.S\u0394ct + Fct12 (Additional file 1C). The newly formed pUC57-CO.S(Y1145A) + Fct12 and pUC57-CO.S\u0394ct + Fct12 were then digested with PmeI and the released inserts were ligated individually into full-length rLaSota clone which was predigested by PmeI and dephosphorylated by TSAP to construct rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct12 and rLaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct12, respectively. The sequences of all inserts were confirmed by DNA nucleotide sequencing. The recombinant viruses were rescued using the reverse genetic technique as previously described [43]. Rescued recombinant viruses were plaque purified and propagated in 10-day-old SPF ECE. The infective allantoic fluids were harvested, aliquoted and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C for further work. The insertion of the different forms of IBV S genes were detected by RT-PCR using LaSota specific primers flanking the PmeI site and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.\n",

A live-attenuated vaccine belonging to GI-23 lineage may provide better protection against prevalent field strains, but development of a new live-attenuated vaccine is expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, a live-attenuated vaccine may revert to virulence, contributing to creation of new variant viruses [27].

The IBV S protein in rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct12 and rLaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct12 were modified to abolish the intracellular retention signal and to facilitate the transport of the IBV S protein to the cell surface [11]. This was done hypothesizing that presenting the IBV S protein at the cell surface would elicit a better humoral immune response. In addition, the modified S proteins were fused with the last 12 amino acids of NDV F protein to facilitate incorporation into the NDV virion envelope [48].",

Although the three IBV vaccine candidates significantly reduced the severity of the clinical signs, they did not show reduction in tracheal viral shedding, which is another important criterion for determining the efficacy of an IBV vaccine. This result indicates that the immune responses elicited by single immunization may not be high enough to stop the virus shedding from the respiratory tract. It should be noted that IBV is a highly infectious and a fast replicating virus [49]. Therefore, it will require a high level of high affinity neutralizing antibodies and cell mediated immune response to completely block IBV replication in the respiratory tract, which is not achievable by live-attenuated IBV vaccine. Our results are in agreement with previous reports that rNDV expressing S protein prevent disease but do not stop virus shedding [40]. Another possible explanation is that the 1-day-old chicks may have immature immune system that could not have elicited a robust protective immune response after single immunization. It has been shown that vaccination of SPF chicks by IBV vaccines at day 1 of age, and to a lesser extent at day 7 of age, provided a poorly protective IBV specific immune responses, while vaccination at day 14 of age and older provided better protection against IBV challenge [50].",

However, rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct12 and rLaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct12 provided only protection against the clinical disease but did not significantly decrease the tracheal viral shedding. This could be because the IBV S protein in case of rLaSota/wt.S elicited more effective cell mediated immune response, which is crucial for clearance of the IBV from the respiratory tract [1, 51\u201354] and also it has been reported that the humoral antibody titer does not correlate with the resistance to respiratory infection [1, 55, 56]. Another possible explanation is that the modifications done in the S protein of IBV in rLaSota/S(Y1145A) + Fct12 and in LaSota/S\u0394ct + Fct12 could have changed the conformation of the IBV S protein and/or rendered loss of critical T cell epitopes necessary for effective blocking of IBV infection.

Furthermore, NDV-vectored IBV vaccine will protect both IBV and NDV. This vaccine will also benefit countries neighboring to Egypt, where antigenically similar IBV strains are prevalent.
