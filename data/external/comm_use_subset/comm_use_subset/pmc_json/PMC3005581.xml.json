Contagious illnesses spread farther and faster than ever with the increase in plane traffic. New outbreaks of Ebola in Zaire [2] and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in China [3] and Marburg [4] emerged with implications for international travel and trade and required coordinated international response. The IHR(1969) also wholly depended on the affected country to make an official notification to the WHO once cases were diagnosed and lacked mechanisms to foster collaboration between the WHO and a country in which public health events with potential for international spread were occurring. The IHR(1969) also lacked effective incentives to encourage compliance by Member States. The limitations of the IHR(1969) therefore paved way for its revision to address the above-mentioned gaps and provide real-time information to inform formulation of measures to prevent international disease spread. The revised IHR(2005) was adopted by the 58th World Health Assembly on 23 May 2005 and entered into force on 15 June 2007 [5].",

The strategy promotes the integration of surveillance activities for priority conditions, taking advantage of common surveillance and support functions at all levels. Uganda adopted the strategy in 2000 [7] and it is being used as the vehicle for implementing the IHR(2005) [8]. Article 5 and Annex 1a of the IHR(2005) require countries to assess the ability of existing national structures, capacities, and resources to meet the minimum requirements for surveillance and response, within two years following the entry into force of these regulations. This assessment is meant to inform the process of developing and implementing action plans to ensure that all the core capacity requirements for the IHR(2005) are established and maintained throughout the country. In line with this requirement, the Ministry of Health (MoH) Uganda, with support from the WHO, conducted an assessment of the core capacities required for implementation of the IHR(2005) during the period 12 to 13 October 2009. The purpose of the assessment was to obtain baseline information on the current status of IHR(2005) core capacities for all the five hazards and at points of entry so as to facilitate the development of an action plan to guide the establishment and maintenance of the capacities in the country.",

In Uganda, the IDSR strategy offers a good framework for launching the IHR(2005) implementation given the promising reporting indices. However, the priority diseases list, surveillance guide lines, case definitions and reporting tools have to be updated to incorporate all the IHR(2005) priority diseases and hazards. The revised tools and guidelines should then be disseminated for use by all IHR stakeholders including districts and health facilities since the assessment revealed shortage of surveillance tools and guidelines, especially at the peripheral levels. Cross-border surveillance activities were reactive and only undertaken when there was an ongoing public health risk or hazard. Designation of points of entry for routine implementation of cross-border surveillance activities needs to be undertaken. Article 44 of the IHR(2005) provides for collaboration between countries in developing and maintaining public health capacities [5]. In light of this, the East African Community (EAC) Secretariat initiatives on pandemic influenza preparedness and response should be exploited to strengthen the IHR(2005) core capacities as well.",

Correspondingly though, the national laboratory SOPs were available at the national level, however, critical shortages of laboratory SOPs, reagents, equipment and staffing were observed in the districts.
