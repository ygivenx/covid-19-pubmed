Leishmune\u00ae provided protection associated with the ability to trigger early and persistent activation of neutrophils and monocytes, in addition to activation of T CD4+ and T CD8+ lymphocytes displaying high levels of IFN-\u03b3 in the CD4+ T-cell subset [29,30]. Additionally, the Leish-Tec\u00ae vaccine (Hertape Calier, Juatuba, Brazil; A2 antigen plus saponin as adjuvant) has also been shown to induce increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 in four out of seven dogs with L. chagasi-infected bone marrow [21]. More recently, a vaccine composed of excreted/secreted antigens of L. infantum promastigotes, referred as LiESAp has been shown to induce increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 and nitric oxide (NO), thus supporting its leishmanicidal effect [31]. The efficacy of the LiESAp vaccine was reported as 92% in a double-blind randomized study [19]. LiESAp is commercially available as CaniLeish\u00ae (Virbac, Carros, France) and is able to induce a Th1 profile and reduce the parasitic load of infected macrophages co-cultured with lymphocytes from immunized dogs [32].",

Previous studies of dogs using the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine displayed higher counts of circulating and Leishmania-specific CD8+ T cells in addition to high nitric oxide (NO) production [22] and reduction of splenic parasite load [27].

The filial generations, comprising of offsprings resulting from the cross between the original mongrel dogs pairs were used further maintain the mongrel dog colony. In the present study, twenty mongrel dogs (10 males and 10 females), with seven months of age and negative results for indirect fluorescence immunoassay to anti-Leishmania antibodies, were selected and received an anti-helmintic treatment and were submitted to poly-vaccination protocols, including rabies (Tecpar, Curitiba-PR, Brazil), leptospira, parvovirus, canine distemper, type II adenovirus, parainfluenza and coronavirus (Vanguard\u00ae HTLP 5/CV-L; Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY, USA). Prior the experimental onset, the animals were maintained in quarantine in kennel runs (4m length x 2m width x 3m height) completely covered with stainless steel wire mesh to prevent the entry of sand flies. The kennel facilities were sprayed with pyrethroid insecticide, every three months, as a measure to control insect access. Each run was installed with an infrared lamp heating (250 watts) to ensure the thermal comfort of animals during the night and on cold days. All the dogs were housed without environmental enrichment (e.g. toys, exercise regimes, etc). The dogs were monitored twice a day, as routine inspection, during which the responsible veterinary was in charge of stimulating and playing with them to aiming to avoid behavior problems and minimize their suffering or distress throughout the study. All the experimental procedures described in this study, including this aspect of animal care was approved by Federal University of Ouro Preto Ethics Committee in Animal Experimentation (protocol number 2010/71).

Therefore, a vaccine against VL would be an important tool for controlling CVL and would dramatically decrease anxiety regarding L. chagasi infection in humans [18,47]. In this sense, the establishment of biomarkers of immunogenicity is considered critical in the rational approach for analyzing candidate vaccines against CVL, and it contributes to identifying the pattern of immune response in dogs and the search for vaccine candidates against CVL [48,49]. For this reason, in this work, the immunogenicity and protective effects of the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccination in dogs were investigated using levels of NO and cytokines and evaluations related to the spleen parasite load. Furthermore, the addition of sand fly saliva extract to vector-based vaccines can enhance the ability of the host to control or block Leishmania infection [38,33].",

However, in some reports, the role of IL-4 was related to the resistance profile or susceptibility profile of CVL [50,51]; the higher levels of IL-4 are considered the hallmark of dogs naturally infected with L. chagasi [52] and sustained reduction of IL-4 has been also reported by other immunogen candidates.

Interestingly, the presence of TGF-\u03b2 has been associated with inducing immunosuppression characteristics during the course of VL [57,58]. Moreover, the presence of TGF-\u03b2 in vitro has a protective effect for amastigotes in macrophages, favoring the maintenance of parasitism [59]. In addition, Alves et al. [50] reported high levels of TGF-\u03b2 associated with increased parasite load in lymph nodes from symptomatic dogs and concluded that TGF-\u03b2 is associated with morbidity in CVL. In this context, it is possible to hypothesize that lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group would indicate the establishment of immunoprotective mechanisms, whereas higher amounts in the \u201cControl\u201d group would be associated with the susceptibility pattern after L. chagasi-challenge.",

            "text": "Analysis of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been considered a prerequisite for composing immunogenicity analyses before and after experimental challenge with L. chagasi in clinical trials of anti-CVL vaccines [48,26]. The analysis of TNF-\u03b1 before vaccine immunization (T0) demonstrated increased levels in SLcA-stimulated cultures in the \u201cControl\u201d and \u201cLbSapSal\u201d groups and demonstrated a tendency for enhanced amounts in the \u201cSal\u201d and \u201cLbSal\u201d groups. Similar results were observed for IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 at T0. These results seem to indicate that SLcA stimulation would induce increased levels of these cytokines, pointing to an inherent feature of the antigenic stimulus. For this reason, we evaluated all groups and analyzed the same stimulus in each group to identify a cytokine profile regarding type I immune response. This strategy demonstrated enhanced levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 post-vaccination and sustained production of both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 even after early and late post-challenge periods in the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d group. Some studies have described TNF-\u03b1 as being associated with a resistance profile in CVL [52,60, 61,62,63] or in dogs vaccinated against CVL [53], and has been associated with susceptibility when associated with high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 [64]. Results obtained by Strauss-Ayali et al. [65] showed that after stimulation with exogenous IL-12, PBMCs from L. infantum\u2212infected dogs were able to reverse an apparent state of anergy, resulting in increased production of IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, Menezes-Souza et al. [62] found that low levels of IL-12 concomitant with high levels of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 represent a favorable condition for the persistence and replication of parasites in CVL. It has been described that IFN-\u03b3 is linked to a resistance profile in different experimental models for VL [50,61,66,67,68] and in dogs vaccinated against CVL [21,26,29, 30,53].",

Distinct studies have been published aiming to determine the experimental L. chagasi-challenge plus sand fly saliva using intradermal route in dogs would be more similar to natural infection than intravenous challenge [71,72]. However, using intradermal challenge, the dogs would be asymptomatic during all the study, besides to present lower parasitism [71]. Since the \u201cLbSapSal\u201d vaccine presents saliva as antigenic compound, the ideal experimental challenge to test the protection should ideally be performed by intradermal route, as analyzed in our study.",

In fact, we have previously demonstrated that \u201cLbSapSal\u201d induced resistance biomarkers specifically related to expansion of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and Leishmania-specific subsets and lower levels of parasitism [22,27].

The establishment of a polarized type I immune response after \u201cLbSapSal\u201d immunization supported increased levels of NO production, favoring a reduction in parasitism and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection.
