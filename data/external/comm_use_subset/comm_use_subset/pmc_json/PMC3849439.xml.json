S1 is located at the N-terminus of the molecule and has a spherical structure that includes the domain that binds to receptors on the host cell [12]. S2 is located at the C-terminus of the spike protein and contains HR1 and HR2, which are the primary regions responsible for the fusion of the virus to the cell membrane of the host. Upon the binding of S1 to the host receptor, S2 undergoes a structural transformation that exposes HR1 and HR2, which form a six-helix bundle structure [13,14]. This type of helix structure formation is characteristic of class I viral fusion [15]. Many in vitro studies of SARS-CoV have reported that exogenous HR2 peptide can bind to viral HR1, thereby efficiently blocking the entry of the virus into cells and inhibiting the replication of the virus [16-19].",

The results showed that when high concentrations of FP5 20 \u03bcM and IFN-\u03b1 1000 IU were used alone, viral titer reduced by 1.81 and 1.46 LogPFU/ml, respectively, the growth of FCoV could not be blocked completely. However, when 20 \u03bcM FP5 was combined with 10 to 1000 IU of IFN-\u03b1 and when 10 \u03bcM FP5 was combined with 1000 IU of IFN-\u03b1, a complete inhibitory effect was observed, and viral titer reduced by up to 4.08 LogPFU/ml. This inhibitory effect is higher than the additive effect mediated by the two agents alone (Figure 3). These combinations showed synergetic effects, as determined by a two-way analysis of variance (P < 0.05). ",

Among these peptides, the anti-HIV-1 peptide, enfuvirtide (T-20), has already been incorporated into a clinical regimen and shown strong efficacy against HIV infection [35-37]. Although the crystal structure of the S protein of FCoV remains to be determined, by aligning the amino acid sequences derived from FCoV with other members of coronaviruses [38], the HR2 domain was predicted, and peptides corresponding to this domain were designed. HR2 was chosen because it was found to be more effective than HR1 in previous studies [26,31,39]. ",

The inhibitory efficacy is not correlated with the lengths of these reported HR2 peptides and the central helix region of HR2 containing amino acid residue 1161 to 1175 are critical to inhibit SARS-CoV infection. In addition, truncation of N-terminal was found to be more related to the loss of potency than the C-terminal [16,19]. While examing the inhibitory effect of our feline peptides we found that FP4 with the extra residures NNTLVNL at its C-terminus compared to FP3, showed a significant potential to inhibit viral replication (Figure 2). The finding indicates that these residues might play an important role in the process of membrane fusion, thus inhibiting viral replication.",
