            "text": "Tobacco bushy top virus (TBTV) is a member of the Umbravirus genus, which requires the presence of Tobacco vein-distorting virus (TVDV) for infectivity in the field [1]. TBTV is encapsidated by the coat protein encoded by TVDV, which is needed for transmission via aphids [1, 2]. However, mechanical inoculation of sap from diseased tobacco onto healthy plants leads to the loss of TVDV, implying the independent pathogenicity of TBTV [1]. Together, these viruses caused severe stunting and destructive bushy-top disease in tobacco in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1960s [3] and in Asia including China in the 1990s [1]. During 1993 to 2001, there were 51,300 hm2 of tobacco bushy top-diseased fields including 8,700 hm2 of total field failure in Yunnan Province of China [4]. In addition to TBTV and TVDV, two components including tobacco bushy top disease-associated RNA (TBTDaRNA) and satellite RNA of TBTV were also identified in tobacco with bushy-top disease [5, 6], although all four components were not always present together [7].",

Sudden appearance, extreme virulence and degeneration of the epidemic of tobacco bushy-top disease was a pattern similar to that of other destructive diseases [9\u201312], whose lethal pathogens underwent quick attenuation of pathogenicity. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the new TBTV isolates produced mild pathogenicity and how they were evolved. For single-stranded RNA viruses, recombination is a major evolutionary event allowing isolates to adapt to new environmental conditions and hosts [13], and frequent recombination events have been detected for various RNA viruses such as Soybean mosaic virus and potyvirus isolates [14\u201316].",

Based on comparisons with other Umbraviruses, p35 and its frameshift product p98 are responsible for genome replication [18\u201320]. p98 contains the ubiquitous RdRp GDD motif of positive-strand RNA virus and is presumably the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [18, 21]. Based on studies conducted with Groundnut rosette umbravirus, p26 is a long-distance movement-associated protein and is also responsible for stabilization of viral RNAs and nuclear shuttling [22, 23], and p27 is likely a cell-to-cell movement protein [22].",

For ORFs encoded by the TBTV isolates, ORF3 and ORF4 was relative stable while ORF1 was the most variable based on the identities of ORFs-coding sequences among 8 TBTV isolates.

The remarkable divergence of TBTV-YWDu (Fig. 2a, c and d) and TBTV-MD-II (Fig. 2b) from the other TBTV isolates were also indicated by the phylogenetic trees. Two phylogenetic trees based on ORF3 and ORF4-coding sequences showed similar branches, which suggested that ORF3 of TBTV isolates underwent similar evolution as ORF4. Based on all data of molecular diversity and phylogentic tree, it is suggested that different ORFs-coding regions and the 3\u2019 UTR in TBTV underwent separate evolution, and the diversity of ORF1-coding region mainly determined the diversity of full-length genome.",

            "text": "During evolution of the single strand RNA viruses, recombination is a major evolutionary way for an isolate to adapt to new environmental conditions and hosts [13\u201316]. In this study, recombination events were also analyzed among all 8 TBTV isolates. Total 29 potential recombination events were detected, in which three recombination events (events 27, 28 and 29) in TBTV-YWDu showed high reliability with P-value of at least three methods <1 \u00d7 10\u22126 (Fig. 3b and Table 3). These three recombination events in TBTV-YWDu were located within 3\u2019 half and have same parents of TBTV-Ch/possible TBTV-MD-II, which is supported by the phylogenetic analysis. In phylogenetic trees based on ORF3, ORF4 and 3\u2019UTR in 3\u2019 half of TBTV genome, TBTV-YWDu and TBTV-Ch (the minor parent) formed into a cluster, while TBTV-MD-II (the possible major parent) belonged the other different groups (Fig. 2b, e, and f). However, TBTV-YWDu formed a separate group in phylogentic trees based on ORF1 and p98-C in 5\u2019 half of genome (Fig. 2a and c), which implied why there is no recombination events in 5\u2019 half of TBTV-YWDu. The other 9 recombination events (events 4, 10, 15, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25 and 26) seem to have a high degree of certainty due to recombination score > 0.6 (Table 3). Three recombination events (events 4, 10 and 15) with similar breakpoints (629\u20133207 in TBTV-MD-I, 652\u20133207 in TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh) were supported by phylogenetic tree (Table 3 and Fig. 4a), in which TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh formed into a branch with their minor parent TBTV-YYXi of events 10/15 and TBTV-MD-I formed into a branch with its minor parent TBTV-JC of event 4. Recombination event 22 was also supported by phylogenetic tree (Table 3 and Fig. 4b), in which TBTV-YLLi was formed into a branch with its minor parent TBTV-JC. Meanwhile, TBTV-JC was also the minor parent in recombination event 2 in TBTV-MD-I (recombination score is 0.469), which was also supported by phylogentic tree based on the fragment of 200\u20131550 (Fig. 4b). Three recombination events (events 24, 25 and 26) in TBTV-YLLi also showed some correlation with phylogenetic tree based on the fragment of 1500\u20132480 (Table 3 and Fig. 4h), in which TBTV-YLLi formed into a branch with its minor parent of event 24 and has near relationship with the minor parent TBTV-YYXi (event 25) or TBTV-JC (event 26). For two recombination events (events 19 and 20) in TBTV-YYXi, there is no correlation between recombination assay and phylogenetic tree based on ORF3 or ORF4-coding region (Fig. 2e and f), in which TBTV-YYXi formed into a separate group. It is suggested that events 19 and 20 are possible with uncertain minor parents (Table 3). For 17 recombination events with recombination score between 0.4-0.6, some of them also showed certain correlation with phylogenetic analysis. Three events (events 1, 3 and 23) with same breakpoints (616\u2013965) in TBTV-JC, TBTV-MD-I and TBTV-YLLi were supported by phylogenetic tree based on the fragment of 616\u2013965 (Fig. 4d), in which TBTV-JC, TBTV-MD-I and TBTV-YLLi formed into a branch having nearest relationship with their co-minor parent TBTV-YYXi. Two recombination events (events 9 and 13) with same breakpoints (253\u2013385) in TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh also showed some correlation with phylogenetic tree based on the fragment of 253\u2013385 (Fig. 4c), in which TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh formed into a branch having the nearest relationship with their co-minor parent TBTV-MD-II. For event 16 in TBTV-YYXi, clue of recombination was found from phylogenetic tree based on the fragment of 180\u20132070 (Fig. 4f), in which TBTV-YYXi formed into a branch separately derived from the branch of minor parent TBTV-MD-II. In addition, four recombination events (events 7, 8, 12 and 14) with similar breakpoints in TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh also showed correlation with the phylogenetic based on the fragment of 200\u2013800 (Fig. 4g), in which TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YWSh formed into a branch having the nearest relationship with other branch including their minor parents TBTV-JC and TBTV-MD-I. The other two recombination events (events 11 and 21) spanning 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 region in TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YYXi were also supported by the phylogenetic tree based on 3\u2019UTR (Fig. 2b), in which TBTV-Ch and TBTV-YYXi along with TBTV-YWSh formed into a branch. In addition, clue of the event 17 in TBTV-YYXi can be found in the phylogenetic tree based on p98-C-coding sequences (Fig. 2d). Only three events (events 5, 6 and 18) were not supported by the corresponding phylogenetic trees (Fig. 4g and e). It is suggested that events 5, 6 and 18 are possible with uncertain minor parents (Table 3). All above data implied the inherent relationship between phylogenetic analysis and recombination assay. Based on the analysis on P-value, recombination score and the correlation with phylogenetic trees, 24 events within 29 possible recombination events are certainly true, while the other 5 events (events 5, 6, 18, 19 and 20) only have low-level likelihood.",

TBTV-MD-II may have different ancestor since it always formed a different branch from the branch including TBTV-JC and TBTV-MD-I in all phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2). Although they seemed to undergo different evolution, they showed mild pathogenecity, which may due to following reasons. First, activity of RdRp was altered since RdRp-coding region is the most variable for TBTV. Second, the expression level of replicase components was lower than that of severe pathotype, which is partly confirmed by primary data of in vitro translation of p35 and p98 (Wang and Yuan, unpublished data). In addition, mutagenesis of TVDV may also partially cause the mild symptom of tobacco bushy top diseases, since TVDV could not support TBTV in some samples of tobacco bushy top disease such as sample from Baoshan city (Additional file 1: Table S1) and the other related data [7]. Further attention and effort are necessary to figure out the detailed mechanism on the lower expression of replicase components encoded by TBTV and the absence of interaction between TBTV and TVDV in nature.",

The first nucleotide of them is a guanylate instead of an adenylte reported in the other TBTV isolates. Identities and phylogenetic analyses indicated that variants ORFs and the 3\u2019 UTR in TBTV were evolved separately. RdRp-coding region was the most variable among TBTV isolates and the divergence of ORF1 is mainly correlated with the divergence of the full-length genome. Frequent recombinations were detected among TBTV isolates. For three new TBTV isolates, they have different recombination pattern and may have different ancestors.",
