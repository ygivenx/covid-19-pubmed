            "text": "Calfhood diseases play a key role in the economy of dairy farms because they increase operating costs and reduce long-term productivity of the animal. Incidence of disease is associated with increased mortality rates [1], and enteritis is the most common diagnosis in young calves [2], which, according to Svensson, Linder and Olsson [3], contributes to 23% of calf losses during the first 14 days of life. Neonatal calves are prone to sickness because their immune system is immature. Furthermore, the process of birth itself causes an elevated stress level for the newborn and exposure to an oxygen-rich environment leads to an increased generation of reactive oxygen species [4, 5]. Reactive oxygen species induce peroxidation of lipids and other macromolecules, leading to alteration of cellular components, interaction with signaling cascades and modification of physiological cell functions [6]. If not properly counterbalanced by antioxidative defenses, excessive production of reactive oxygen species results in oxidative stress, which is a cofactor of disease in humans and farm animals [5, 7, 8]. Adequate colostrum supply is vital to calves because colostrum ensures ingestion of nutrients and contains immunoglobulins (Ig), peptides, antioxidants and other bioactive factors supporting maturation, antioxidative and immune defense as well as local intestinal immunity [9].",

            "text": "Quercetin, which belongs to the subclass of flavonols, is ubiquitous in most plants and is of interest for scientists for its beneficial use in humans and farm animals. Its antioxidative capacity can ameliorate the acquisition of passive immunity in neonates, based on the finding that feeding antioxidant-enriched colostrum enhanced IgG absorption and antioxidative status in newborn calves and piglets [14, 15]. Similarly, Retskii et al. [16] showed that correcting the antioxidative balance in newborn calves prior to first colostrum ingestion increases the acquisition of colostral immunity and reduces the incidence of enteric colibacillosis. Another beneficial effect of quercetin is its local action in the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro studies of intestinal epithelium demonstrated that quercetin down-regulates the expression of genes related to inflammation in inflamed epithelium [17], and Lozoya et al. [18] showed in a clinical study that oral quercetin administration reduced abdominal pain in acute diarrheic disease in humans. In guinea pigs, mice and rats, the inhibitory action of quercetin on prostaglandin E2-induced ileal contractions and on castor-oil-induced diarrhea has been demonstrated [19, 20]. Furthermore, quercetin acts as a prebiotic, thus inhibiting adhesion of enteropathogens to Caco-2 cells without affecting the viability of probiotics [21], and improves performance in hens by modulating cecal microflora populations [22].",

Repeated measures on the same calf were taken into account using the REPEATED statement of the MIXED procedure and a type for the block diagonal residual covariance matrix chosen in dependence on the levels of day of life. For concentrations of plasma metabolites, hormones and data on antioxidative status in plasma, an unstructured type was used. For the plasma concentrations of flavonols, acute-phase proteins and Ig, a compound symmetry type was used. For data on heart and respiratory rate, as well as body temperature and feed intake, an autoregressive (1) type was applied. Least-squares means (LSM) and their standard errors (SE) were computed for each fixed effect in the models and all pairwise differences of LSM were tested by the Tukey-Kramer procedure. The SLICE statement of the MIXED procedure was used to conduct partitioned analyses of the LSM for interactions. Fecal score was analyzed by a generalized linear mixed model using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS/STAT and a Poisson model with the fixed factors diet, quercetin and day of life (repeated variable) and all interactions between these fixed factors. Repeated measurements on the same animal were taken into account by the RESIDUAL option of the RANDOM STATEMENT of the GLIMMIX procedure using a compound symmetry structure for the block diagonal residual covariance matrix. Sick frequencies of calves with respect to diet and quercetin were analyzed with the FREQ procedure of SAS/STAT software using two-way tables of diet by sick and quercetin by sick and the exact Pearson chi-square test.",

The pattern of flavonol fractions in the plasma in this study was different from the patterns in 29-day-old calves or adult cattle but comparable to observations in 2-day-old calves [24, 36]. This result can be explained by the maturation of intestinal metabolism because it has been shown for rats and pigs [37, 38] that orally administered flavonols undergo complete metabolism inside the intestinal mucosa, where glucuronidation is of major importance [39].",

Cortisol is crucial for initiation of parturition and catabolic activity, especially during hypoxia at birth. However, a decrease of the plasma cortisol concentration is delayed in formula-fed calves, as seen in previous studies [41, 42].

            "text": "As we expected, the concentration of total protein in the plasma increased only in the colostrum-fed groups, although the protein content of the formula and colostrum was similar. The decrease of the albumin concentration from day 1 to day 2 was probably caused by hemodilution after first feed intake and coincides with previous findings [49, 50]. Because only Ig, but not the albumin concentrations in plasma were affected by colostrum feeding, differences in total protein are most likely caused by absorption of colostral immunoglobulins after colostrum intake [42]. Colostrum intake is important not only for maturational processes but also to acquire passive immunity because the bovine placenta is impermeable to antibodies. As reviewed by Weaver et al. [51], calves with serum IgG concentrations below 10 g/L (total protein < 52 g/L) 24 h after birth suffer from failure of passive transfer, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as reduced performance. In our study, colostrum-fed calves exceeded this threshold; however, failure of passive transfer was a relevant problem in formula-fed calves, although they were parenterally supplemented with bovine immunoglobulins on day 1. Only formula-fed calves showed slight hyperthermia on the first days of life and a higher incidence of diarrhea, probably caused by gastrointestinal inflammation due to missing local immunity [52], accompanied by abdominal pain and diminished appetite. Obviously, parenteral and oral treatments with immunoglobulins could not prevent local or systemic infections in formula-fed calves, probably because of missing herd-specific immunoglobulins in the formula and the administered drugs. However, we did not perform microbiological analyses in the feces of the calves to determine pathogens that might have caused loose feces. The time course of plasma IgM concentration in formula-fed calves indicates that the indigenous production of IgM is evident as early as day 4 of life, but the concentrations are too low to effectively protect against infections [9].",

Because serum amyloid A is more susceptible to stress [53, 55], including physical stress, we suppose that the plasma concentrations were equally high in all groups due to the experimental procedures (e.g., continued venipuncture, restricted feeding, single penning, temporal fixation and dietary changes).",

Under immunocompetent conditions, the impact of various noxae leads to local production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin-1, which in turn induce the systemic acute phase response, including synthesis of acute phase proteins [57]. Within signal transduction, reactive oxygen species act as second messengers, thus enhancing TNF-induced gene expression, and oxidative conditions potentiate the activation of respective pathways [57, 58]. Although high doses of quercetin were repeatedly shown to reduce mRNA expression of TNF in vitro [59, 60], application of prophylactic doses increased the ratio of pro- to anti-inflammatory cytokines in murine macrophages [60]. We assumed that the hepatic quercetin concentration in our experiment did not exceed the prophylactic dose; thus, quercetin might have increased the expression of TNF. Unfortunately, we did not measure TNF protein concentration, but we suppose that posttranscriptional processes anticipated TNF signal transduction [17, 61], because quercetin scavenged reactive oxygen species necessary for signal transduction. Therefore, the observed quercetin effects on TNF gene expression could not have been forwarded on the expression of target genes, e.g., IL1B or acute phase proteins, as would have been expected otherwise.",

[62] and Stohrer, Lutz and Stangassinger [63] concluded from comparisons between calves and dams that the former are highly susceptible to oxidative stress due to immature defense systems, whereas Ga\u00e1l et al. [64] deduced from high FRAP values, despite the high reactive oxygen species, that calves are well-prepared to address oxidative stress. Although the increase of TEAC in this and a previous study of our group [65] indicates rising antioxidative capacity during the first week of life, this result was not supported by determination of FRAP, another marker of antioxidative capacity. Furthermore, the values of TBARS, which serve as a proxy to measure the products of lipid peroxidation, were unaffected by age in this study, which contradicts earlier studies [62, 64, 66]. However, the reliability of TBARS is criticized for low sensitivity and specificity, and the use of F2-isoprostanes is recommended as the most reliable approach to assess oxidative stress in vivo [67, 68]. The time courses of F2-isoprostanes were significantly decreased in all calves; thus, we support the theory that exposure to an oxygen-rich environment following hypoxia during birth results in severe oxidative stress in the newborn [5]. Although quercetin is known to exert antioxidative effects, we did not find improved antioxidative status in the plasma of calves nor increased hepatic expression of antioxidative enzymes, which is in line with previous findings of our group in research conducted on neonatal calves and lactating dairy cows [65, 69]. Orally administered quercetin is completely metabolized inside the intestinal mucosa; thus, the gastrointestinal tract is the first site of action for quercetin [39], as it is for pathogens and gastrointestinal disorders commonly occurring during the first weeks of life. Because we did not examine the intestinal tissue, we cannot exclude local effects of quercetin on antioxidative status. Except for F2-isoprostanes, the parameters of the antioxidative system in the plasma were higher after colostrum feeding. Colostrum is a source of reactive oxygen species, but it also contains a variety of antioxidative factors [66, 70], the latter increasing with time after parturition [71]. The absorption of pro- and antioxidants present in colostrum [72] might have contributed to the rise of the respective parameters in the plasma of colostrum-fed calves and triggered immunological processes, which in turn caused elevated plasma levels. However, the hepatic mRNA abundances of antioxidative enzymes seemed not to be affected by diet, but all groups were fed milk replacer from day 3 onwards and potential dietary effects on hepatic antioxidative status might not be long-lasting.",
