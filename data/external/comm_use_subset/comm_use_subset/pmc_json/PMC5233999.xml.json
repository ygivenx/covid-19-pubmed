The corresponding line scan and height profile of the sample are shown in Fig. 2(d). After activation by EDC-NHS, GO exhibits an increased thickness of about 4 nm, similar to what was reported before419. The line scan (arrow) gives a corresponding cross-sectional height profile in Fig. 2(d), showing a uniform surface of the GO. Because the antibody is very large (with a molecular weight of over 150 kDa), one can correctly expect that the antibody-conjugated GO should be much thicker. As shown in Fig. 2(c), we observed that the height of antibody-conjugated GO increased dramatically, with a typical thickness of about 10 nm, as suggested in the height profile in Fig. 2(d). Some bright peaks were observed on this sample, which was also similar to what Hosseini et al. had observed4. The bright peaks are likely due to the accumulation of antibodies on the GO surface. All of the surface morphology results implied that the antibody was successfully retained on the GO surface.",

Due to the fact that binding sites on the antibody-conjugated GO were limited, when more analyte IgG proteins adsorb on antibody-conjugated GO, fewer binding sites remain for IgG-FITCs, so that more free IgG-FITCs will be in the solution and produce more fluorescence signals. Therefore, there is a positive and quantitative correlation between the analyte IgG concentration and the fluorescence intensity of free IgG-FITCs. According to this principle, our assay relies on the effectiveness of GO as an energy acceptor to provide efficient fluorescence quenching.",

As we expected, the fluorescence of the free IgG-FITCs decreased when the IgG-FITCs bound to the graphene surfaces. In Fig. 3(a), a rapid decrease of fluorescence intensity was observed with the increasing amount of bare GO, exhibiting a quenching efficiency of about 90% with 10 \u03bcg mL\u22121 of GO. The signal change versus GO concentration is plotted in Fig. 3(d). The quenching efficiency of antibody-conjugated GO may be lower than bare GO, because the modification of GO with antibodies changed the electronic property of GO, changing GO to a semiconductor19 and making the transfer of energy from the excited state of FITC to bare GO easier than that to antibody-conjugated GO. In Fig. 3(b), the fluorescence intensity also decreased with the increasing amount of antibody-conjugated GO, and the quenching efficiency indeed dropped to about 60% at 200 \u03bcg mL\u22121, showing antibody-modified GO could still be a quencher. With 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 of antibody-conjugated GO, about 30% of IgG-FITC initial fluorescence had been quenched, as can be seen in Fig. 3(d). Therefore, with analyte IgG in the solution, the fluorescence intensity change of IgG-FITC will be between 0 to 30% with respect to initial fluorescence with no analyte.",

If the fluorescence of IgG-FITCs will be quenched no matter if it is free or attached to the GO surface, the design is meaningless. By blocking the GO surface with 2% BSA in the buffer solution, we found that the fluorescence intensity change remained almost unchanged with increasing amount of BSA-blocked GO. Only the IgG-FITCs adsorbed on the surface of the GO could be quenched. According to our results, the appropriate concentration of antibody-conjugated GO was 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 (~30% quenching). Although more GO might quench the fluorescence even further, a higher antibody-conjugated GO concentration could be less sensitive for sensing the analyte IgG with a very small concentration. Therefore, there is a delicate balance between the concentration of GO and the change of fluorescence signal. In the following experiment, antibody-conjugated GO always had a concentration of 100 \u03bcg mL\u22121.",

The results in Fig. 5 clearly show that the 3 possible interfering biomolecules gave no detectable signal change, as compared with the blank sample.

The activated GO was redispersed in PBS to react with 50 \u03bcg of rabbit anti-human IgG so as to modify the GO with the antibody. The samples were mixed on an electronic shaker at 15 \u00b0C for 2 h. Remaining active sites of GO were blocked with 2% BSA in 20 mmol L\u22121 of PBS buffer solution for 30 min.
