When multiple etiologies are being estimated, simulation experiments (pathogens A and B in Supplementary Figure 1) show that the coefficients are biased as a result of measurement error and inherent negative correlation among the predictors because in this simulation only 1 predictor can be positive (ie, in a case where pathogen A is the true cause, pathogen A will more likely be positive and the other pathogens will more likely be negative relative to other cases). Because pathogens with an odds ratio \u22641 result in a zero or negative attributable fraction, these pathogens do not appear in the etiologic distribution and are interpreted as not being causes of the disease. Attributable fraction analyses also typically do not account for imperfect sensitivity of the tests so implicitly assume a sensitivity of 100%; if the sum of attributable fractions across the multiple etiologies assessed is <100%, this implies that the remainder is due to other pathogens not tested for.",

            "text": "We illustrate using an example common to pneumonia etiology studies of integrating NP/OP PCR results from cases and controls with blood culture data from cases to estimate the etiologic fraction due to pneumococcus. Let us assume we observed 9 of 600 (1.5%) hospitalized cases with pneumococcus detected by blood culture, and based upon prior data from vaccine probe trials, we assume that blood culture sensitivity is between 5% and 20%, with 95% probability. After accounting for the false negatives, we would estimate the proportion of cases with pneumococcal pneumonia to be between 7.5% and 30% (ie, 7.5% of cases if the sensitivity is 20%, and 30% of cases if the sensitivity is 5%). For NP/OP PCR data, let us assume that high density NP/OP colonization with pneumococcus is a proxy for pneumococcal pneumonia but with imperfect specificity that can be estimated using the control data. Suppose that in the cases, we detected 30% with high-density NP/OP pneumococcal colonization and observed odds ratio of 2 when compared with controls. Using the attributable fraction method, we would estimate 15% of cases to have pneumococcal pneumonia if we assume NP/OP PCR test sensitivity is 100% (ie, 1\u2212[1/OR = 2] \u00d7 30%). However, the study data provide evidence regarding sensitivity of NP/OP PCR, which is the proportion of the 9 blood culture\u2013positive pneumococcal cases that also had high-density pneumococcal colonization. As with the first test, we also use prior knowledge about the sensitivity of the NP/OP PCR. Suppose that the observed rate of concordance of the 2 tests, combined with the prior knowledge, leads us to conclude that the true NP/OP PCR sensitivity is in the range 50%\u201390% with high probability. If so, then between 17% and 30% (ie, 15%/90% and 15%/50%) of cases would be estimated to have pneumococcal pneumonia based on the NP/OP PCR data. Note that although the estimates from the 2 measurements are not identical, they are relatively consistent in that both support estimates in the range of 17%\u201330% (ie, the overlapping range from the 2 data sources).",

They do so with an informed set of prior expectations based on the season of the year, knowledge about common causes of pneumonia, the age of the patient, and so forth. Likewise, in a Bayesian analysis, the study team must provide a set of principled evidence-based expectations about the state of the infection in the population of the cases (ie, etiology and sensitivity \u201cpriors\u201d), before incorporating the evidence from the observed data. Stating the assumptions regarding the sensitivity of each measure as was done above is an example of setting sensitivity priors. If there were no prior information to suggest that 1 pathogen is more likely responsible for the pneumonia over another for any given case, then setting every pathogen as equally likely is an example of an etiology prior. More technical details on the PERCH integrated analysis methodology are presented in the PERCH Integrated Analysis Statistical Methods section and in Table 1, and this is followed by simulation analyses demonstrating its advantage over attributable fraction.",

As a Bayesian method, the key unknowns (etiologic fractions, sensitivities) are assumed to have probability distributions that represent our uncertainty about their values. The analysis starts with the user-specified prior distributions that reflect our degree of uncertainty before the study and are updated by the evidence in the data to produce posterior distributions reflecting our reduced uncertainty after the study. This approach uses the prior as a starting place. Although providing starting values for the distribution of the etiology fraction may seem counterintuitive because this is what we aim to learn from the study, in PERCH we choose \u201cnoninformative\u201d priors that represent our starting assumption that each pathogen has an equal chance to be the cause for a particular child.

If odds ratios are estimated without adjusting for the results of the other pathogens, the resulting attributable fraction estimates are unbiased when sensitivity is 100% (blue box plots in Supplementary Figure 1).

The etiologic fractions of the pathogens are not constrained to sum to 100%, so the distribution will incorrectly sum to <100% when \u22651 pathogens have <100% sensitivity.

For example, the Aetiology of Neonatal Infections in South Asia (ANISA) case\u2013control study aims to determine the etiology of serious neonatal infections, including sepsis and meningitis [15]. The ANISA study needs to integrate multiple test results from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and NP/OP specimens collected from cases with those from blood and NP/OP specimens collected from controls. This suggests that the PERCH integrated analysis has applications beyond pneumonia etiology research.",

The PERCH integrated analysis is a novel analytic method that surmounts these limitations by integrating evidence from multiple, imperfect diagnostic measurements on cases and controls to estimate the etiologic distribution and assign etiology to individuals, all with estimations of uncertainty for the population of cases and for each individual case. This analytic advance has potential applications in etiology research beyond pneumonia.",
