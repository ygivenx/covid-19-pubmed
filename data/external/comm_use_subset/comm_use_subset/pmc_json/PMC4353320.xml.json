A random number table was used to generate assignments, in blocks of 4 or 6.

Participants in the vaccine group received one intramuscular injection of Fluviral\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada) 2008\u20132009 trivalent inactivated split virion influenza vaccine containing influenza A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 (H3N2) and B/Florida/4/2006. Participants in the antiviral prophylaxis arm were prescribed one 10 mg dose of zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae; GlaxoSmithKline) per day for the influenza season. Participants who experienced side effects and discontinued antiviral prophylaxis were given either Fluviral\u00ae or Vaxigrip\u00ae (Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, ON, Canada) but remained in the antiviral arm of the study for analysis. The influenza season was defined, a priori, as starting when the proportion of all specimens tested for influenza in the province was >3% positive for 1 week or >2\u00b75% for two consecutive weeks and ending when the proportion was less than 2% positive for two consecutive weeks. These definitions were established to keep the risk of exposure to influenza low for participants on prophylactic antiviral medication. This study was approved by Health Canada and Mount Sinai Hospital's Research Ethics Board, was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00784784) and was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines.",

Robust variance estimates were used to adjust for correlation due to several ARI reports from the same participants. All weekly reports for people without signs or symptoms of a respiratory illness were used as controls. Weeks without a reported illness were not eligible for inclusion in the analyses.

One participant randomized to antiviral prophylaxis, who reported taking 93% of prescribed doses, tested positive for influenza B by NAAT on 18 February 2009, but had no change in HAI titres. A second person taking antiviral prophylaxis did not report symptoms of an acute respiratory illness on questionnaires nor when questioned during the final study visit, but had a 16-fold increase in antibody titres to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1). This individual reported 100% compliance with the prophylaxis, stopped taking medication May 25th and had their final study visit (and blood draw) on July 15th.

Secondly, participants provided exposure information after they reported ARI, which likely biased their recall of exposure to people who had symptoms of an acute respiratory illness. Also, since the 2009 pandemic strain of influenza A started to circulate towards the end of the planned study period, it likely increased long-term adherence to the prophylactic antiviral medication. In a previous study, it was found that adherence started to wane towards the end of the influenza season.21 As most of the study participants worked in an acute care facility and had regular internet access, it is likely that our study population was of a higher socioeconomic status than the general population which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
