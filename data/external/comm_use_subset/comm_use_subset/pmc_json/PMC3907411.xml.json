As an initial effector of host antibacterial innate immunities, antimicrobial peptides distributed in skin tissues contribute to control surface (wound) infections [4]\u2013[7]. In severely burned patients, however, sufficient amounts of antimicrobial peptides are not produced in tissues surrounding the burn sites [8]\u2013[10]. The lack of antimicrobial peptide production leads to the invasion of pathogens from surface infections to systemic infections [11]. In our accompanying paper [10], lineage\u2212CD34+CD31+ cells (designated as CD31+ IMC) isolated from peripheral blood of severely burned patients (patient CD31+ IMC) were shown to be inhibitory on the HBD production by normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). Lineage\u2212CD34+ cells isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood were shown to be non-inhibitory on the peptide production by NHEK, and these cells were characterized as lineage\u2212CD34+CD31\u2212 cells. Lineage\u2212CD34+ CD31+ cells were not isolated from healthy donor peripheral blood. CCL2 and IL-10 released from patient CD31+ IMC were identified as inhibitory factors for the HBD production by NHEK.",

To test the beneficence of glycyrrhizin in a more clinical setting, in this study, the anti-pseudomonal effect of glycyrrhizin was investigated in a human model of the severe burn injury combined with pseudomonal skin infections. In addition, the effect of glycyrrhizin on the suppressor cell activities of patient CD31+ IMC on the HBD-1 production was investigated at the grafted site tissues in the chimeras. A human model of severe burn injury was \u03b3-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3null mice that were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients and inoculated with their syngeneic peripheral blood CD31+ IMC (patient chimeras), or grafted with cultured NHEK and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31+ IMC (patient chimera substitutes). Experimentally induced CD31+ IMC were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers 24 hours after intense exercise on a treadmill for 1 continuous hour, as previously described [13]. These cells have been shown to transiently appear after intense exercise (heart rate baseline: 130\u2013145 beats per minute) for one continuous hour (first appeared 12 hours after exercising, peaked 24 hours after exercising, and then disappeared).",

According to the recent information obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (http://jaxmice.jax.org/events/2011/032411UNIVIL nsg.pdf), we utilized these mice as mice that are deficient in both innate and adoptive immunities (without functional T cells, B cells, and NK cells). Also, these mice are carriers of defective functions (phagocytosis, digestion, antigen presentation, and activation) of macrophages [28]\u2013[31]. Before being used in our experiments, these mice were exposed to whole body \u03b3-irradiation (4 Gy) to deplete neutrophils. Bone marrow cells or peripheral blood cells taken from these mice have been tested morphologically for residual neutrophils after Wright-Giemsa and alkaline phosphatase staining. In the results, neutrophils were not recovered from these mice 1 to 7 days after \u03b3-irradiation, even when they were stimulated with pathogens. After \u03b3-irradiation, these mice were housed in the BSL-2 Animal Facility, and fed autoclaved food and water to avoid infectious complications.",

When glycyrrhizin is utilized in experiments, 1,000 \u00b5g of the compound was first dissolved in 1 ml of saline or serum free RPMI medium at room temperature (1,000 \u00b5g/ml). Then, it was further diluted to the appropriate concentrations with saline or serum free RPMI medium and stored at 4\u00b0C until utilized. Based on our previous data [12], [13], 1\u2013100 \u00b5g/ml concentrations of glycyrrhizin were added to the tissue cultures, and 1 to 10 mg/kg doses of the compound were administered to the chimeras. These concentrations of glycyrrhizin have been confirmed as non-toxic in many papers [19]\u2013[22].",

Because large numbers of CD31+ IMC were not obtained from severely burned patients, the same cells were experimentally generated from healthy donor peripheral blood cells and utilized in some chimera experiments (to set up experimental conditions and to determine survival effect of glycyrrhizin after P. aeruginosa infections). Thus, experimentally induced CD31+ IMC were prepared from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (heart rate baseline: 60\u201375 beats per minute) subjected to intense exercise on a treadmill (Cybex International, Medway, MA, USA), where their heart-rate was consistently kept elevated to 130\u2013145 beats per minute (metabolic equivalents: 6.5 to 7.8) for one continuous hour. As a result of this exercise program, lineage\u2212CD34+CD31+ cells first appeared 6 or 12 hours after exercising, peaked 24 hours after exercising, and then disappeared [13]. Therefore, lineage\u2212CD34+CD31+ cells isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers 24 hours after intense exercise for 1 hour were utilized as experimentally induced CD31+ IMC. Experimentally induced CD31+ IMC and patient CD31+ IMC were shown to have identical properties for producing IL-10 and CCL2 and inhibiting HBD-1 production by NHEK.",

Murine AMPs (MDB-1, MBD-2 and MBD-3) were not detected in skin homogenates of either group of chimeras treated with the IgG preparation. Anti-murine skin AMP rabbit IgG was purified from sera of rabbits that were immunized with the murine skin homogenates with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant, as described previously [33], [34].

The effect of glycyrrhizin was evaluated by the decrease in (i) the mortality rates of patient chimera substitutes and (ii) the growth of pathogen in kidneys of patient chimeras. Kidneys from infected patient chimeras were weighed, and disrupted with an Omni tissue homogenizer with 2 ml PBS. The number of bacteria in the homogenates was measured by a standard colony-counting method and expressed as per gram organ. To determine the percentage of survival, infected mice were monitored twice a day for signs of disease, which typically included piloerection, hunched gait, lethargy and eye discharge.

In our accompanying paper [10], lineage\u2212CD34+CD31+ cells (CD31+ IMC) that appeared in peripheral blood of severely burned patients have been shown to be responsible for inhibiting HBD-1 production by NHEK. In the first series of experiments in this study, the role of skin antimicrobial peptides on the resistance of mice against P. aeruginosa i.d. infection and subsequent sepsis was confirmed in \u03b3-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice depleted of murine skin antimicrobial peptides. \u03b3-Irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice lack functional immunocompetent cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and macrophages. As a result, all these mice depleted of murine skin antimicrobial peptides (mouse B) died after infection with 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa, while all of the mice with the peptides (mouse A) survived even though they were exposed to the same infection (\nFig. 1a-1\n). Also, murine antimicrobial peptide (MBD-1) was detected in skin homogenates of \u03b3-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice, while this peptide was not detected in those of the same mice treated with anti-murine AMP rabbit IgG. Human antimicrobial peptide (HBD-1) was not detected in the skin homogenates of \u03b3-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice treated with or without the IgG (\nFig. 1a\n\n-\n\n2\n). In the next experiments, these mice depleted of the murine peptides were grafted with NHEK (1\u00d7106 cells/mouse, i.d.) and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31+ IMC at the grafting site tissues. Then, these mice were infected with 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa at the grafted site tissues, and their mortality rates were observed. As a result, all of the chimeras created with NHEK alone (chimera A) survived after P. aeruginosa i.d. infection. However, all of the chimeras created with NHEK grafting and experimentally induced CD31+ IMC inoculation (chimera B) died within 3 days of the same infection (\nFig. 1b-1\n). All chimera B without any infections with P. aeruginosa survived for 2 weeks or more. HBD-1 was detected in homogenates of grafted site tissues of chimera A, while HBD-1 was not detected in grafted site skin homogenates of chimera B (\nFig. 1b\n\n-\n\n2\n). These results indicate that host antibacterial resistance of chimeras created with NHEK against P. aeruginosa i.d. infection is completely inhibited by experimentally induced CD31+ IMC. Chimera C, created with healthy donor lineage\u2212CD34+CD31\u2212 cells, were shown to be resistant against 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa i.d. infection (\nFig. 1c-1\n). As shown in chimera C, the amount of HBD-1 produced in chimera A was not influenced by healthy donor peripheral blood lineage\u2212CD34+CD31\u2212 cells (\nFig. 1c\n\n-\n\n2\n), indicating that lineage\u2212CD34+CD31\u2212 cells do not suppress HBD-1 production. The results shown in Figs. 1a, 1b, and 1c indicate that skin antimicrobial peptides (a, murine peptides; b and c, human peptides) are very important in the resistance of mice to P. aeruginosa i.d. infections, and CD31+ IMC are responsible for inhibiting HBD-1 production by skin tissues.",

Antibiotics are effective against topical wound infections and subsequent development of sepsis in severely burned patients [3]. However, antibiotic chemotherapies often encourage abnormal microflora and multi-antibiotic-resistant bacterial generation. Therefore, a new paradigm to treat opportunistic burn wound infections is urgent for severely burned patients. In our murine studies, P. aeruginosa burn wound infection and subsequent sepsis have been immunologically controlled by glycyrrhizin [12]. This suggests that a glycyrrhizin therapy may be the new paradigm to treat severely burned patients with P. aeruginosa burn wound infection. To establish anti-pseudomonal efficacies of glycyrrhizin in a more clinical setting, in this paper, the protective effect of glycyrrhizin on sepsis stemming from P. aeruginosa skin infections was studied in a chimera model of severely burned patients. The experiments were performed in \u03b3-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3null mice grafted with unburned skin tissues (discarded small pieces of skin that were utilized for autograft surgery) of severely burned patients and their syngeneic peripheral blood CD31+ IMC (patient chimeras). Also, in one part of the infection experiments, patient chimera substitutes (\u03b3-irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r\u03b3null mice grafted with cultured NHEK and experimentally induced CD31+ IMC) were utilized, because sufficient numbers of burn patient peripheral blood CD31+ IMC were not available. Immunological similarities of patient chimeras and patient chimera substitutes have been demonstrated by (i) impaired production of human skin antimicrobial peptides, (ii) increased susceptibility to P. aeruginosa i.d. infection, and (iii) remarkable production of human CCL2 and IL-10 (effector factors for patient CD31+ IMC to inhibit antimicrobial peptide production).",

The protective effect of glycyrrhizin against graft site P. aeruginosa i.d. infection was examined in patient chimeras that were previously eliminated of murine skin antimicrobial peptides. This syngeneic experimental system may display accurate antibacterial responses shown by severely burned patients with P. aeruginosa burn wound infection. After infection with P. aeruginosa at the grafted site, bacteria grew in kidneys of the chimeras, while bacteria were not detected in kidneys of the same chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin. These results indicate that sepsis stemming from grafted site P. aeruginosa infection is not developed in patient chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin. The effect of glycyrrhizin on the survival of patient chimera substitutes i.d. infected with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa was also tested. As a result, all of the chimeras treated with saline died within 3 days of infection, but 100% of the same chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin survived more than 7 days after the same infection.

These adverse effects are due to the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin in the intestine to the pharmacologically active compound glycyrrhetic acid, which inhibits the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that is involved in the metabolism of corticosteroids. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to increased cortisol levels in the kidneys [36].

Therefore, the protective effect of glycyrrhizin against grafted site pseudomonal infections in chimeras must be displayed through the host\u2019s antibacterial functions influenced by glycyrrhizin. In previous murine studies [12], glycyrrhizin-associated improvement on antimicrobial peptide production is shown to be key on the protection of severely burned mice with pseudomonal wound infections. The importance of skin antimicrobial peptides against invasion of pathogens in wound tissues has been well-described [4]\u2013[7]. However, antimicrobial peptides are not produced in skin tissues surrounding the burn wound [8], [11], and small numbers of the pathogen that invaded the burn wound can spread easily into the whole body [11]. Skin antimicrobial peptides were produced in tissues surrounding the burn area of mice treated with glycyrrhizin [12]. Since glycyrrhizin had no stimulating activities on the antimicrobial peptide production by skin keratinocytes, glycyrrhizin may improve the peptide production by keratinocytes indirectly. Gr-1+CD11b+ IMC have been identified as murine effector cells on burn-associated impairment of the peptide production [11]. In this human study, CD31+ IMC have been identified as cells that inhibit the peptide production by skin keratinocytes. Human antimicrobial peptides were not produced by unburned skin tissues in transwell-cultures with their syngeneic CD31+ cells. In this transwell-culture, the effect of glycyrrhizin on the improvement of the peptide production was tested. In the results, the peptides were produced in this transwell-culture supplemented with glycyrrhizin. Subsequently, CCL2 and IL-10 released from CD31+ IMC were shown to be inhibitory on the peptide production by skin keratinocytes, and these cytokines were not produce by CD31+ IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. All of these facts strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhizin on the production of IL-10 and CCL2 by CD31+ IMC may be important in the anti-pseudomonal activity of the compound.",

            "text": "How glycyrrhizin suppresses cytokine production by CD31+ IMC is not known. Recent studies have indicated that glycyrrhizin binds to the glucocorticoid-like receptor [37] and mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) [38]. Because the enhancer region of the CCL2 gene is inhibited by glucocorticoids, progesterone, and estrogen in cells stimulated with inflammatory mediators [39], [40], the binding of glycyrrhizin to the glucocorticoid-like receptor may result in the inhibition of CCL2 gene activation. The phosphorylation of HMGB1 by casein kinase I and protein kinase C promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines; however, the phosphorylation of HMGB1 is inhibited by glycyrrhizin after binding [38]. These inhibitory effects of glycyrrhizin on the transcriptional factors may be involved in controlling cytokine production by CD31+ IMC. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of glycyrrhizin on the activation of NF-\u03baB, STAT3 and MAPKs (including JUNK, p38 and ERK) in monocytes/macrophages have been demonstrated during acute inflammatory responses [41]\u2013[46]. The activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPKs is important for CCL2 production [47], and the increased production of CCL2 requires STAT3 activation [48]. These molecular mechanisms influenced by glycyrrhizin may also be involved in suppressing cytokine production by CD31+ IMC. Further analytical studies are required.",
