Porcine deltacoronavirus, which belongs to delta-CoV, was first reported in an epidemiology investigation in Hong Kong [5]. Thereafter, PDCoV was detected and isolated across the world [7\u201313]. The PDCoV genome is approximately 25-kb long, containing a 5\u2032 untranslated coding region (UTR), replication-associated genes (1a, 1b), a spike (s) gene, an envelope (e) gene, a matrix (m) gene, a nucleocapsid (n) gene, two nonstructural genes (ns6, ns7), and a 3\u2032UTR gene.",

In pigs infected with PDCoV, the symptoms of diarrhea are very similar to that of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV); therefore, it is difficult to clinically distinguish these viral pathogens.",

Based on detection target, these methods can be divided into virological and serological methods. For the detection of specific antibody, the most commonly used serological assays included virus neutralization (VN) test, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [16\u201318]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are the most commonly used virological methods for the detection of nucleic acid. Various PDCoV-specific RT-PCRs and RT-qPCRs have been developed to detect PDCoV [2, 11, 12]. However, the detection limit of the gel-based RT-PCR for PDCoV detection has not been established [11, 12]. Real-time RT-qPCR was more sensitive than conventional PCR [2, 19]. Although the detection limit of nested PCR was similar to that of real-time RT-PCR, the additional amplification procedure made this test more complicated and easier for contamination.",

Thus the aim of the present study was to improve the sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR used for PDCoV detection via screening primers and optimizing PCR reaction conditions. Meanwhile, there is no report about the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay for the detection of PDCoV. Thus, a SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay was developed to compare the detection limit against conventional RT-PCR. Furthermore, conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were used to evaluate clinical samples.",

Currently, there are no effective treatments and vaccines against PDCoV infection. To monitor the health of pig herds, scientists need to develop a rapid diagnosis method that is suitable for most laboratories in China. A rapid and accurate diagnosis would be helpful to identify and segregate infected animals in a timely manner. Therefore, the main objective of present study is to establish the conventional RT-PCR and SYBR green-based RT-qPCR methods with high sensitivity for PDCoV detection. The sensitivity of developed conventional RT-PCR is same as that of RT-qPCR. After comparing the results of clinical samples analyzed by both assays, we concluded that these methods were sensitive, rapid, reliable, and cost-effective in nature.",

Nevertheless, conventional RT-PCR is still widely used for detecting PDCoV [11, 12]. Although previous studies have used conventional RT-PCR to detect PDCoV, the detection limits of these assays have not been defined till date [11, 12]. A previous report has described that the detection limit of LAMP method was 10 copies, which was 100 times more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR [20]. This indicates that RT-PCR can detect PDCoV with a detection limit of 1000 copies. Recently, nano-particle-assisted PCR assays were used to increase the sensitivity of conventional PCR [22\u201324]. In the detection of duck Tembusu virus, the detection limit of nano-particle-assisted PCR was 1.8 \u00d7 102 copies [23]. This indicates that the sensitivity of nano-particle-assisted PCR was 10-fold more than that of conventional PCR assay [23]. In theory, PCR assay can detect as few as 1 DNA/RNA molecule. However, the limit of detection for conventional PCR commonly could not achieve theoretical value because of various factors, such as primer design and reaction inhibitor in genome extract.",

The conservation of the target gene is important to the broad reactivity of the RT-PCR assay for detection of heterologous strains. The PDCoV n gene was demonstrated to be highly conserved and chosen to be the target gene of RT-PCR and RT-qPCR in many studies [6, 12]. Thus, the n gene was selected as the target gene in our study. To improve the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR, we adjusted several primer pairs and optimized reaction conditions. It was found in our study that the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR assay could be significantly improved with selected primers. However, modulation of reaction conditions, such as annealing temperature and primer concentrations, had no effect on the performance of the assay. The optimal sensitivity of RT-PCR was 2 \u00d7 101 copies by using the primers PCR-F/R for PDCoV detection, which was equal to that of SYBR green-based RT-qPCR. The result was confirmed by the tests carried out in three independent days. The conventional RT-PCR had several advantages against the RT-qPCR as follows: RT-PCR does not require an expensive device for operation; moreover, RT-PCR is a cost-effective technique. In present study, it was proved that the sensitivity of RT-PCR was significantly improved in resource-limiting settings. Therefore, the high sensitivity of this method will reduce false negative results. The sequences of PDCoV n gene have been used to generate the phylogenetic tree to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV [13]. In our study, the n gene products were approximately 950 nt in length; these gene products could be sequenced directly, providing a robust tool for molecular epidemiology study.",

The detection result of the conventional RT-PCR assay was 100% in agreement with that of the RT-qPCR assay, indicating the high sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR assay. The positive rates detected by conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were both 41.7%. However, when the samples were tested by one-step RT-PCR [11], an assay reported in a previous study, the positive rate was only 26.2%. These results demonstrated that the previously reported conventional RT-PCR with low sensitivity would underestimate the prevalence of PDCoV infection in pig herd. Considering that most testing laboratories are equipped with thermocyclers rather than sophisticated quantitative PCR instruments, the highly sensitive conventional RT-PCR is more suitable for extensive applications in laboratories, which are specifically designed for PDCoV detection and surveillance.",
