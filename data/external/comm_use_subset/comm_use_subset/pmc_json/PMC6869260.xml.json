            "text": "Rice stripe virus (RSV), a typical member of the genus Tenuvirus, is transmitted mainly by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) (SBPH) in a persistent and propagative manner, and can infect many crops, such as rice, wheat, and several other gramineous plants, resulting in a severe loss of grain [1]; in addition, Sun et al. reported that the virus can also infect Arabidopsis thaliana [2]. The infected plants exhibit typical symptoms, such as alternating yellow and green stripes, curly and drooping leaves, and necrotic lesions [3]. Previous reports indicated that the plant chloroplasts were damaged by excessive accumulation of starch, which was triggered by RSV infection, resulting in alternating yellow and green stripes [4]. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MT), an amine hormone that was isolated and identified from the pineal gland in the late 1950s, has been revealed to possess a broad spectrum of biological functions in both animals and plants in many studies [5\u20139]. In particular, MT has been considered as a therapeutic indole for combating viral diseases, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and WNV (West Nile virus) [10]. Consistent with the benefits of MT in immunology and medicine in animals, MT can also induce plant resistance to pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, Alternaria spp., and Fusarium spp. [11, 12]. However, the detailed mechanisms of MT -triggered plant innate immunity to viruses are elusive. Recently, several studies also indicated the potential involvement of a gaseous signal molecule or plant hormone in the defense response triggered by MT. For example, it was reported that nitric oxide (NO) induced by MT is responsible for disease resistance to Pst DC3000 infection in Arabidopsis [13]. Indeed, the vital role of NO in plant-pathogen interactions has been demonstrated by many studies [14\u201318]. NO can be produced through the nitrate/nitrite-dependent pathway that is known to be catalyzed by nitrate reductase (NR) [19] and through the L-arginine-dependent pathway that is known to be catalyzed by a mammalian NO synthase (NOS)-like enzyme [20, 21]. Further, Lee et al. found that the disease resistance induced by MT correlates with plant hormones in Pst DC3000 [11, 22]. Thus, these studies may provide a potential mechanism for the effect of MT and NO in plant against other pathogen infections.",

Quantitative RT-PCR using RSV CP specific primers showed that RSV RNA accumulated similar in both RSV-inoculated Zhendao 88 and Nipponbare plants at 7, 14 and 21 dpi, but RSV RNA accumulated in Zhendao 88 plants was much lower than in Nipponbare plants at 30 dpi the expression level of CP was significantly higher in Nipponbare than Zhendao 88 at 28 and 35 dpi (Fig. 1b). Consistently, approximately 85% of the RSV-inoculated Nipponbare plants showed virus symptoms, while only approximately 10% of the RSV-inoculated Zhendao 88 plants showed virus symptoms (Fig. 1c). Thus, these two rice cultivars were used for further analysis.\n",

As shown in Fig. 3c, compared to the water-treated group, Old-SNP treatment failed to reduce the disease incidence as SNP did, and cPTIO can exacerbate disease, which indicated that NO may play a vital role in the rice response to RSV infection. In addition, cPTIO could eliminate the MT positive effect on the disease incidence, which suggested that NO serves as a mediator in MT triggered rice resistance to RSV infection. Overall, we speculated that MT and NO can promote rice resistance to RSV, and NO functions downstream of MT in this pathway.\n",

The results indicated that OsPR1b and OsWRKY 45 were induced by RSV infection and OsPR1b might act downstream of MT and NO signaling pathway, and OsWRKY 45 could be partially downstream of MT and NO signaling pathway, because of the low expression level after the treatments in uninfected plants.
