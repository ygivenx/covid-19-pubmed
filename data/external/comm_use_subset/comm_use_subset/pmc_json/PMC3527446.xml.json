            "text": "An emerging concept in cell biology is the formation of microscopically visible supramolecular assemblies involved in very distinct cellular processes, ranging from metabolism to RNA silencing. Noxious insults that activate the cellular stress response trigger the transient accumulation of stress granules (SGs) in the cytoplasm. SGs belong to a novel family of cellular structures collectively known as mRNA silencing foci that harbour repressed mRNAs and their associated proteins [1]. SGs assemble as a consequence of the global translation silencing provoked by the inactivation of the translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) by specific kinases that are activated upon cell stress. Processing Bodies (PBs) are related foci and are as well induced upon stress. There is controversy on whether SGs and PBs are cause or consequence of mRNA repression. SGs and PBs from different organisms appear to differ on composition and function and a continuous spectrum of entities exits. Nevertheless, SGs and PBs are highly dynamic and they may dissolve thus releasing the repressed mRNAs to allow translation according to cellular needs [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. SGs contribute to the cell survival response by regulation of specific signalling pathways [7], and the cellular mechanisms that control their assembly and disassembly are incipiently described (reviewed in [1]).",

            "text": "Cell damage induces the assembly of additional supramolecular complexes in both the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. The endoribonuclease Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (Ire-1) and UV-damaged RNA concentrate in cytoplasmic Ire-1 foci or UV-bodies, respectively. DNA replication factories form foci associated to damaged DNA [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Translational silencing is frequently linked to the formation of distinct aggregates. For instance, local translation regulation is relevant to synaptic activity and involves the dynamic formation of a plethora of mRNA silencing foci located at the synapse [14], [15]. The eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) bodies are another example linked to translation regulation and their integrity and dynamics are crucial for eIF2 recycling [16], [17], [18]. Finally, a number of dynamic supramolecular factories were reported to occur in several cell types. These include Purinosomes and glutamine synthetase foci, which concentrate specific biosynthetic enzymes and dissolve when the levels of the end-product metabolite increase [19], [20], [21]. Enzymes may also reversibly aggregate for storage in an inactive state, as is the case of the CTP synthetase in yeast cells, Drosophila embryo and mammalian axons [22]. In addition to all these structures, a large variety of cytoplasmic or nuclear supramolecular complexes such as nuclear stress bodies, eisosomes [23], U-bodies, splicing speckles and Cajal bodies, among others, assemble and disassemble dynamically, depending on changes in cell physiology (reviewed in [1], [24]).",

            "text": "Besides its relevance in mRNA silencing and decay, SGs and PBs are relevant to the pathophysiology of several conditions. SG and PB dynamics are affected by virus infections (reviewed in [25], [26], [27]). More recently, SGs have been linked to abnormal protein aggregates involved in neurodegenerative diseases [28], [29], [30], [31]. Thus, there is an increasing interest in identifying pharmacological and genetic enhancers and inhibitors of SG and PB formation. A pioneer work for identifying regulators of SGs and PBs involved the analysis of thousands of micrographs [32]. These high-throughput studies would be facilitated by automated methods. Here we report a MATLAB script that we named BUHO for the analysis of supramolecular aggregates in mammalian and Drosophila cells. Briefly, objects were identified by their similarity to a number of prototypes, which were of different size, shape and intensity. BUHO is easy to use and simple to adjust for the analysis of a variety of cellular components. We used it to analyze SG and PB induction in mammalian and Drosophila cells exposed to stress. With minor adjustments, the script was also useful to study the dynamics of specific neuronal mRNA silencing foci termed S-foci. Finally, we used BUHO to analyze the effect of candidate genes on SG formation in an RNAi-based experiment in Drosophila S2R+ cells. We found that focal adhesion kinase 56D (FAK56D), general control non-derepresible 2 (GCN2), and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) govern SG assembly. PP1 mediates SG dissolution and its role is conserved in mammalian cells, as judged by the enhancement of SG formation provoked by the PP1 inhibitor salubrinal. All these experiments were evaluated manually and by BUHO, and in all cases the differences were lower than 5% of the average value. The automated analysis of diverse cellular components by this user-friendly method allows massive image processing in short times as well as minimizes variations between different operators by providing a robust, flexible and reliable high-throughput alternative to the laborious and sometimes unfeasible visual scrutiny.",

To develop a MATLAB script for the computerized analysis of supramolecular aggregates we used SGs as a model system. These mRNA silencing foci are an ideal model since their size and number vary depending on the cellular physiology. Drosophila S2R+ cells were exposed or not to arsenite, a known inductor of oxidative stress that promotes SG formation [1], [33]. To visualize SGs and cell nuclei we co-stained the cells with oligodT-Cy3 and DAPI as indicated in Materials and Methods and 63\u00d7 confocal images of 512\u00d7512 pixels were taken. As expected, in addition to SGs the FISH for polyadenylated RNA stained also the nucleus as well as faintly the cytoplasm (Figure 1A). Six images of stressed cells and three images of untreated cells were then manually analyzed. As previously reported [33], SGs formed in half of the cells (Table 1). These images were used as a training set to adjust a MATLAB script to identify cells and the SGs inside them. MATLAB imported the Cy3 and DAPI images as 512\u00d7512 matrices where each matrix element has values from 0 to 65535 corresponding to the intensity of each pixel in the16-bit images. Then, MATLAB operations were adjusted iteratively to minimize deviation from the manual analysis (Table 1), as described below.",

            "text": "The first step was to identify the cells present in the micrographs. Cell segmentation was performed using the MATLAB watershed transform algorithm (watershed function). First, high-intensity noise was eliminated by setting a convenient threshold for each channel. Average DAPI nuclear intensity was 200 in the training set of images (available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/buho/) and less than 0.1% of DAPI-pixels reached values above 255. Cy3 intensities in SGs and cytoplasm were lower than 50 and less than 0.01% of the Cy3-pixels had values above 255. Thus, intensity was clipped to 255 in both the DAPI and the Cy3 channels. The contrast of the DAPI signal was adjusted with the imadjust function and the DAPI signal was used to create a nuclear mask image. All pixels with intensities lower than 60% of maximal values were converted to 0 and points above this threshold were converted to 1 with the image to black and white (im2bw) function. We combined the nuclear mask and the negative counterpart of the oligodT-Cy3 MATLAB matrices to generate a single image where all DAPI-positive pixels were converted to 0 and cells are brightly stained. Cells were clearly recognized in the image corresponding to this operation (Figure 1B). Next, to identify the cells by MATLAB, we calculated the watershed lines according to the topographic distances method. With this operation, the cell area corresponds to a catchment basin and the nuclei to its local minima or bottom of the basin. In summary, the nucleus acted as a marker for cell position and the inverted Cy3 intensity gradient in the cytoplasm allowed the identification of the cell border (Figure 1B, C). Previous to these operations, to compensate the faint overall cytoplasmic oligodT-Cy3 staining, values in the matrix corresponding to the Cy3 signal were multiplied by a factor of two, and additive noise was reduced using the Wiener 2-D adaptive noise-removal filtering method (wiener2 function). These adjustments allowed for a better identification of the cell border, and were not required when the cytoplasm is strongly stained, as in the case of SG detection by immunofluorescence against eukaryotic initiation factor 3\u03b7 (eIF3\u03b7) shown below (see Figure 2).",

In summary, BUHO informs the cell number, the proportion of cells with SGs, the number of SGs per cell and their size with minimal deviation from manual-counted values (Table 1).

Drosophila S2R+ or mammalian U2OS cells were exposed to oxidative or ER-stress as indicated in Materials and Methods, and PBs were visualized by immunostaining of the specific marker DCP1a (Figure 3A). Drosophila PBs were analyzed at 63\u00d7, 1024\u00d71024 pixels, a resolution that we found suitable for size determination of objects with these dimensions (0.2\u20131 \u00b5m2/11\u201356 square pixels). Low intensity noise was removed with the im2bw function and prototypes I\u2013VIII were compared at ST 0.8. Mammalian PBs were analyzed at 40\u00d7, 2048\u00d72048 pixels. In this case, low intensity noise was removed and prototypes I\u2013VIII were compared at STs 0.8, 0.88, 0.8, 0.8, 0.86, 0.86, 0.8, and 0.85 respectively. Adjustment of these parameters was performed by analyzing 123 representative S2R+ cells and 38 representative U2OS cells. Next, PB size was determined using BUHO and the manual method in parallel. As expected, both methods indicated that PBs were significantly larger after exposing the cells to oxidative stress (Figure 3A, B). Drosophila PBs enlarged by a factor of 3.5 and mammalian PB size by a factor 1.5 relative to their normal values. The difference of these values from manual parameters was less than 4% for basal PBs and 10% for induced PBs in Drosophila cells, and less than 7% for basal and 12% for induced PBs in mammalian cells. The total number of PBs in the micrographs was also measured, and we found that the BUHO-generated values (Drosophila basal, 350; Drosophila stress, 102; U2OS basal, 185; U2OS stress, 148) were comparable with the manual values (Drosophila basal, 309; Drosophila stress, 122; U2OS basal, 167; U2OS stress, 129). We concluded that BUHO successfully addresses changes in foci size and number. Moreover, as expected given that SGs and PBs are morphologically similar, we found that prototype SGs were useful to identify PBs.",

            "text": "To test the performance of BUHO in analyzing distances between objects, we focused on the presence of synaptic mRNA silencing foci at the synapse surroundings. Briefly, neurons contain a plethora of mRNA-silencing foci collectively termed synaptic activity-regulated mRNA silencing foci (SyAS). Different synaptic stimuli enhance or reduce the presence of SyAS and there is an increasing interest in understanding SyAS dynamics [14], [15]. For instance, we recently found that a specific kind of synaptic foci named S-foci dissolve upon N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) stimulation [14]. We studied the suitability of BUHO to assess this effect and compared it with the manual analysis. Primary neurons were exposed to NMDA as previously described [14] and S-foci and synapses were identified by immunostaining with specific antibodies as indicated in Materials and Methods. Using 63\u00d7 micrographs, 1024\u00d71024 pixels, we first evaluated S-foci size. The S-foci are morphologically similar to PBs ([14]\nFigure 4) and we used prototypes I\u2013VIII to analyze them. As we did for PBs, low intensity noise was removed and prototypes were compared at ST 0.8. As previously reported, S-foci size was reduced to 71% of basal levels when obtained manually and to 61% when evaluated with the MATLAB script, which are comparable values [14]. We recently reported that in addition to this general reduction in size, synaptic stimulation by NMDA provokes the complete dissolution of the S-foci located at the synapse [14]. To evaluate this important local response we counted the number of synapses with S-foci in their surroundings. Synapses were stained with a specific antibody and identified by correlation with the prototypes I to VIII. Optimal ST was determined to be 0.7 in a preliminary analysis. We used the bwdist function to measure the distances between each synapse and the closer S-foci, and calculated the percentage of synapses with S-foci at a distance lower than 0.5 \u00b5m, which is physiologically relevant [14] (Figure 4). We found that the presence of S-foci at the synapse surroundings was reduced to 50% of basal values. When evaluated manually, they were affected in a similar proportion (41%, Figure 4). We concluded that BUHO is a reliable bioinformatics tool to identify synapses and to assess the vicinity between different cellular structures.",

            "text": "Finally, to simulate a high-throughput RNAi screen, we used the BUHO script for the analysis of a pilot experiment aimed to identify SG regulators. We used Drosophila S2R+ cells in 384 MW plates with robotized manipulation for cell plating, stress induction, staining and imaging as indicated in Materials and Methods. We analyzed three candidate genes predicted to affect SG formation. Previous to the induction of oxidative stress, we treated the cells with dsRNA against FAK56D, GCN2, or PP1\u03b1-96A, or with a non-relevant dsRNA against LacZ. FAK56D is homologous to mammalian FAK, a kinase involved in SG disassembly [34]. GCN2 is an eIF2\u03b1 kinase that mediates SG formation upon oxidative stress in Drosophila\n[35]. PP1\u03b1-96A is the main phosphatase of eIF2\u03b1 and we speculated that this molecule affects SG stability. Triplicate plates including three well with a dsRNA for each gene, 20 wells with a dsRNA against LacZ and 68 wells with no dsRNA were analyzed. Seven images of each well were taken under the same conditions as those from the training set used for the script adjustment and analyzed manually and by BUHO using the prototypes I\u2013VIII, as in Figure 2A. As expected, the values for the number of cells and SGs, and the proportion of cells with SGs were equivalent with the two methods (Table 3) when this test set of images was analyzed. We defined a score as the ratio of the percentage of cells with SGs upon dsRNA-treatment relative to the average percentage of cells with SGs in the controls without dsRNA present in the same plate. As expected, we found that the dsRNA against LacZ had no effect on SG formation (Figure 5A). As previously reported [35], GCN2 knockdown impaired SG formation. FAK56D knockdown had a stimulatory effect, as reported before for the mammalian counterpart [34]. In addition, we found that the knockdown of PP1\u03b1-96A enhanced SG formation in S2R+ cells. To investigate whether the role of this phosphatase is conserved in mammalian cells, we followed a pharmacological approach by using the PP1\u03b1 inhibitor salubrinal. We exposed U2OS cells to a ER-stress insult in the presence or absence of salubrinal [36], which was added 1 hour after the stress-stimulus as indicated in Materials and Methods and investigated SG formation by immunostaining of eIF3\u03b7 at different time points. SGs were identified by BUHO as in Figure 2B. We found that paralleling the effect of PP1\u03b1-96A knockdown in Drosophila cells the pharmacological inhibition of mammalian PP1\u03b1 impaired SG disassembly in U2OS cells (Figure 5B). All these experiments were simultaneously assessed by manual analysis by an independent operator, and deviation from BUHO-obtained values was less than 5%. PP1 is the main eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase and we evaluated phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (PeIF2\u03b1) levels upon exposure to ER-stress in the presence or absence of salubrinal. As previously reported [1], [33], [37] we found that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation increased 13 fold relative to basal values one hour after stimulation, when SG formation is maximal (Fig. 5B and data not shown). At this time, salubrinal was added to inhibit dephosphorylation and PeIF2\u03b1 levels were monitored three hours after stress induction. Paralleling the prolonged occurrence of SGs in the presence of salubrinal, we found that PeIF2\u03b1 levels were 50% higher in the presence of the PP1 inhibitor (Fig. 5C, p\u22640.01). We speculate that dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 is key in regulating SG dissolution and this opens new lines of research. The success of BUHO in this pilot RNAi-based screen documented by automated microscopy underscores its potential in high-throughput imaging analysis.",

This MATLAB script, termed BUHO is easily commanded using Windows operating system and is based in the recognition by similarity to a collection of prototypes. The analysis of a pilot high-throughput experiment including 164304 images at 512\u00d7512 pixels was completed in 120 hours in a relatively low power computer (Perez-Pepe et al, unpublished). The script was optimized for the analysis of SGs in Drosophila cells, and is easy to adjust for the study of a wide variety of supramolecular aggregates in different cell types. With minor modifications, we have successfully applied it for processing images of different magnification and resolution of synapses, SGs, PBs and similar foci in mammalian and Drosophila cell lines as well as in primary cultured neurons. Remarkably, the deviation between BUHO and manual values was less than 5% of the average values. By using a different set of prototypes taken exclusively from confocal images or in combination with prototypes generated with Gaussian filters, we anticipate that BUHO will be also a valuable tool for the analysis of additional cellular structures and supramolecular aggregates that are emerging in the literature [17], [19], [20], [22], [23], [24].",

As expected, we found that this script is a reliable tool to assess changes in SG formation. As reported before for the mammalian FAK56D homologue, we found that the knockdown of this kinase in Drosophila cells enhances SG formation, whereas down-regulation of GCN2 impairs their assembly [34]. In addition, we found that the catalytic subunit of PP1 mediates SG dissolution. The role of this main phosphatase appeared conserved in flies and mammals, and furthermore, we found that PP1 affected the disassembly of SGs induced by different stress stimuli. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 provokes translation inhibition and concomitant SG formation, and dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 correlates with translation recovery after acute stress [1]. Accordingly, our results indicate that PP1 mediates eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, and we speculate that this plays an important role in SG stabilization upon PP1 KD or inhibition by salubrinal. The relevance of additional PP1 targets involved in SG dissolution is unknown. Salubrinal is a relatively new drug and its potential as therapeutic agent is expanding [36]. The contribution of SG regulation to the beneficial effect of this inhibitor remains to be investigated.",

            "text": "We anticipate that the high-throughput screening of natural or synthetic compounds will benefit from the automated analysis of SG formation described here. SGs always form when cells are exposed to stress insults and their formation will be indicative of cell toxicity, which is an important effect to assess when analyzing novel chemicals. The use of BUHO for the automated analysis of other mRNA silencing foci, protein aggregates and cytoplasmic structures in addition to SGs, PBs, synapses and S-foci will require only minor modifications. The spontaneous formation of microscopically visible aggregates that concentrate molecules involved in distinct pathways is common in many different cell types. A fraction of a yeast library including thousands of genes with C-terminal GFP-fusions was visually screened to reveal that numerous proteins form filaments and foci\n[20], [22]. The usefulness of these libraries will be greatly potentiated by high-throughput image analysis like the one described here. Purinosomes, glutamine synthetase foci and other supramolecular factories optimize the biosynthetic pathway by channeling substrates, minimizing diffusion to the cytosol and protecting labile intermediates [19], [20]. Conversely, a number of enzyme aggregates appears to serve as depots [22]. In addition to enzyme aggregates, UV-RNA granules, Ire-1 foci, splicing speckles, nuclear stress bodies, Cajal bodies, eIF2B bodies, and other cytoplasmic or nuclear structures assemble and disassemble dynamically depending on cellular needs. The script here described will result a suitable tool for the high-throughput analysis of these different supramolecular aggregates in diverse experimental settings. Among other outputs, BUHO addresses the number, size and distance between objects, and categorize them by similarity in shape, size and intensity to a variable number of prototypes isolated from original images. By adjusting the correct parameters BUHO can be adapted to the automated analysis of many different cellular components. This user-friendly script allows the analysis of high-throughput imaging data in short times and eliminates variations associated to tedious manual scrutiny that frequently involves more than one operator. This novel bioinformatics tool is a step forward in the expanding field of cellular supramolecular aggregates.",

Monochromatic images correspond to a 512\u00d7512, 1024\u00d71024 or 2048\u00d72048 MATLAB matrix, where the intensity of each pixel is a value ranging from 0 to 255 for 8-bit images (Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5B), or from 0 to 65535 for 16-bit images (Figures 1 and 5A). When indicated, resolution was scaled down to 512 pixels. The MATLAB script developed here, termed BUHO and the confocal images are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/buho/. The proposed collection of prototypes is available at PROTOTYPE.rar at the same URL.",

E, The proportion of false positives relative to the number of seeds and the proportion of positive hits relative to the manual-counted number of SGs was measured at different ST for the prototype IV, depicted in D. An ST of 0.85 allowed no false positives. SG recognition dropped from 80% to 20% at this ST value, and similar values were observed for the other prototypes (not shown). F, The number of positive hits that resulted by correlation with the indicated prototypes subsets was measured.
