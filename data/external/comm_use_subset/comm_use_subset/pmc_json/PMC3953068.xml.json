Dengue infection is caused by dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. There are four serotypes of the virus which are referred to as DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4. All four serotypes can cause the full spectrum of disease [2]. DENV is primarily transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. Other Aedes species that transmit the disease include A. albopictus, A. polynesiensis, and A. scutellaris\n[3]. Although uncommon, DENV can also be transmitted via infected blood products and through organ transplantation [4], [5].",

On the other hand, some patients experience more severe illness such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which can be life threatening [6]. Several factors have been associated with the development of severe dengue including prior infection with a heterotypic serotype, the strain of infecting virus, age and gender, and the genetic background of the patient. DENV-related illness is more common in children, and in contrast to other infections, well-nourished children are more predisposed to severe illness [7]. Polymorphism in genes coding for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), mannan-binding lectin 2 (MBL2), Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), DC-SIGN, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II alleles have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications [8]. Yet another genetic abnormality reported to have a link with DHF/DSS is the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a ubiquitous X-linked enzyme which is part of the innate defense mechanisms [9].",

High frequencies (6.0\u201310.8%) of G6PD deficiency have also been reported for Southeast Asian countries [12]. G6PD deficiency affects the production of reactive nitrogen (RNS) and oxygen species (ROS) such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O2\n\u2212), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) resulting in alterations of normal redox state of the cells [13]. Cells of immune system employ RNS/ROS to kill invading pathogens. A reduction of the redox state of immune cells may render immune cells less effective against invading organisms, resulting in an increased severity of the infection [14].",

Data analysis and anticipated results were obtained by generating a log FL1 (X-axis) versus a log FL2 (Y-axis) dot plot with quadrants added to it. Monocytes with increased production of superoxide demonstrated a bright orange fluorescence and detected using the FL2 channel appeared in the two upper quadrants of a log FL1 (X-axis) versus a log FL2 (Y-axis) dot plot. Monocytes with high production of oxidative stress demonstrated a bright green fluorescence and registered in FL1 channel appeared in the upper and lower right quadrants of a log FL1 (X-axis) versus a log FL2 (Y-axis) dot plots.

However, the underlying mechanism of this enhanced susceptibility was not investigated. Here we confirm Chao's findings and show in addition that reduced production of NO and O2\n\u2212 as well as earlier accumulation of oxidative stress contribute significantly to enhanced DENV2 infectivity in monocytes from G6PD-deficient subjects.",

We have not studied the up-regulation of viral receptors but did clearly see an enhanced production of viral particles in these cells. Based on our findings and those reported by others, we propose a model for the association between the redox status of the host cells and DENV. Following entry into the cell, DENV fuses with endosomal membrane to release its nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm where viral RNA is replicated and translated into proteins. These processes may be affected by the cellular redox state, being more efficient in an oxidizing environment, thus resulting in enhanced virus production.",

Several reports have shown a correlation between severe dengue and high viral loads [27],[28], [29], [30], [31]. G6PD deficiency is reported to cause granulocyte dysfunction [18], [32].

In Thailand, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the general population is approximately 14%. A cohort of 89 males diagnosed with DHF was studied to determine if G6PD deficiency was related to occurrence and/or course of dengue infection. Out of 89, a total of 17 (19.1%) DHF patients had G6PD deficiency, thus no significant association established between G6PD deficiency and DHF [15]. However, this study is based on only a modest number of hospitalized patients and therefore provides little information on the incidence of severe dengue in G6PD deficient individuals. High prevalence of G6PD is also reported in African population [33] but a low incidence of severe dengue is noted in populations of African origin in a couple of studies conducted in Cuba [34] and Haiti [35]. Since the outcome of these studies is inconclusive, well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate whether G6PD-deficient individuals are at risk of severe dengue with statistical significance. Such studies would be potentially beneficial in providing added knowledge of host defense mechanism, and may be clinically important for G6PD-deficient individuals travelling to or living in DENV endemic areas.",
