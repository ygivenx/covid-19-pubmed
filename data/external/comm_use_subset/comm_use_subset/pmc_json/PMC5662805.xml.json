            "text": "FOXO3A, also known as forkhead in rhabdomyosarcoma-like protein 1 (FKHRL1), is a transcription factor with important roles in embryonic development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis [1]. It is characterized by the presence of the distinctive forkhead DNA binding domain, a highly conserved winged helix motif, and regulates the transcription of genes involved in a variety of processes, including cell cycle regulation [2, 3], apoptosis [4, 5], DNA repair [6], and autophagy [7\u20139]. FOXO3A function is regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, which ultimately affect its nuclear/cytoplasmic transport and hence cellular location [10\u201312]. FOXO3A is considered to be a potential tumor suppressor gene and is involved in the regulation of differentiation in various cell types [13\u201316]. Furthermore, FOXO3A is inactivated, and its target genes are downregulated, following phosphorylation by oncogenic kinases such as AKT, MAPK1, and IKK, which are upregulated in many tumors [17\u201319]. Interestingly, the reexpression and activation of FOXO3A in tumor cells reportedly have potential in antitumor treatment [20].",

            "text": "A previous study showed that the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes could confer a growth advantage to a subgroup of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cell clones. Such epigenetic modifications are reversible, and the silenced genes can be reactivated using methyltransferase inhibitors such as decitabine (DAC). Indeed, high doses of DAC are known to impair gene methylation, resulting in the activation of various cellular processes such as apoptosis [21]. On the other hand, at low doses, DAC is incorporated into newly synthesized double-stranded DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle without affecting elongation and induces cell cycle arrest and cellular differentiation [22, 23]. Such S phase-specific DAC incorporation may be responsible for a plateau in DAC activity that was observed in AML cell lines, wherein cellular activity could not be lowered beyond 40% even when the DAC concentration was increased to 50 \u03bcM [24]. However, it is possible to enhance the impact of DAC on cellular activity by extending the treatment duration; a reduction to just 15% of the original activity has been observed after 6 days of DAC treatment [24]. Other reports have confirmed that DAC-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation depends mainly on treatment duration. Additionally, DAC-induced differentiation has been primarily observed at low doses, while high doses tend to be cytotoxic [25]. The optimal dosage of DAC has been explored; Cmax values of 0.3\u20131.6 \u03bcM have been reported in human plasma [26\u201328], while the reported EC50 for a variety of AML cell lines reportedly ranged from 0.4 to 0.8 \u03bcM [24, 29].",

This CD11b expression remained constant throughout DAC treatment, whereas CD14 expression gradually increased on exposure to DAC, with the proportion of CD14-positive cells reaching a maximum of 37.19% \u00b1 9.44% (P < 0.05) after 6 days of treatment (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). FOXO3A expression in SKM-1 cells was very low in the absence of DAC, but increased statistical significance on days 3 and 6 following the initiation of treatment (Figure 1(c)). Expression of the inactive, phosphorylated form of FOXO3A (p-FOXO3A) was predominant in SKM-1 cells, indicating that FOXO3A exists primarily in the inactive form. Interestingly, DAC treatment significantly reduced the relative expression of the inactive p-FOXO3A form, resulting in a consequent increase in the FOXO3A/p-FOXO3A ratio (Figure 1(c)) and strongly indicating that DAC induces FOXO3A activation in SKM-1 cells.",

Interestingly, however, when FOXO3A siRNA-SKM-1 cells were treated with DAC, the observed increase in CD14-positive cells was approximately 50% lower than in cells carrying the negative control siRNA (Figure 1(g)), suggesting that silencing FOXO3A expression before DAC treatment impairs, but does not abolish, DAC-induced SKM-1 cell differentiation into monocytes.

While, compared with control siRNA, silencing FOXO3A had no significant effect on the cell cycle (Figure 2(d)), expression of the FOXO3A downstream targets CDKN1A and CDKN1B was decreased, with the effect on CDKN1A being particularly striking (Figure 2(e)). MYC is another key transcription factor that plays an important role during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Some studies have reported MYC to be a downstream target of FOXO3A, and, indeed, MYC activity can be inhibited by FOXO3A via the MXI1-SR\u03b1 variant [31]. Consistent with this, MYC protein expression was promoted in cells where FOXO3A was silenced compared to in controls (Figure 2(e)). In the presence of FOXO3A silencing, DAC had no effect on either CDKN1A or CDKN1B protein expression, but MYC protein expression was downregulated (Figure 2(g)).",

Furthermore, the autophagy initiation protein BECN1 and the ATG5-ATG12-ATG16 complex proteins, which are associated with nucleation and elongation of the autophagosome, were both upregulated following DAC treatment, confirming the DAC-mediated induction of autophagy in SKM-1 cells (Figure 4(b)).",

While the exact mechanisms underpinning this transformation are unknown, the accumulation of genetic or epigenetic abnormalities is likely to play a role. In particular, the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes could confer a growth advantage and accelerate clonal evolution in abnormal MDS cells. In this study, we have demonstrated that FOXO3A, a potential tumor suppressor gene, is hyperphosphorylated and thus inactivated in SKM-1 cells. However, DAC treatment activated FOXO3A by both increasing expression and reducing phosphorylation, leading to the upregulation of the downstream effectors CDKN1A, CDKN1B, BCL2L11, BECN1, ATG5, ATG12, and ATG16. Consequently, DAC-induced differentiation of SKM-1 cells into monocytes, SKM-1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy were observed.",

While the CDKN1A promoter region is reportedly surrounded by CpG islands, a study of leukemic cells detected no methylation of these CpG motifs [4], suggesting that gene silencing caused by hypermethylation is not responsible for CDKN1A inactivation in leukemia cells and that other mechanisms may be involved in DAC-induced CDKN1A expression. In the ML-1 and BV-173 leukemia cell lines and the HCT116 colon cancer cell line, both of which contain wild-type TP53; DAC-induced apoptosis occurs in parallel with a TP53-dependent, but DNMT1-independent, upregulation of CDKN1A. This effect is not seen in the TP53-null HL-60 cell line, leading to the suggestion that DAC-induced CDKN1A upregulation is dependent on a DNA damage/ATM/TP53 axis [4]. As the SKM-1 cell line used in this study carries an inactive mutant form of TP53 [33], it is likely that DAC induces CDKN1A expression via other mechanisms. We observed that the expression and activity of FOXO3A, a gene that is involved in the regulation of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, increased significantly after DAC treatment. We therefore speculate that the upregulation of CDKN1A, a FOXO3A target gene, is associated with the DAC-mediated activation of FOXO3A in SKM-1 cells; this theory is supported by our FOXO3A silencing data.",

Both FOXO3A and MYC interact functionally with the forkhead binding element in the CDKN1B proximal promoter [34], meaning that MYC may inhibit the activation of CDKN1B by FOXO3A in tumor cells, potentially leading to the uncontrolled proliferation and invasiveness of a variety of tumors. MYC expression increased markedly when FOXO3A was silenced in SKM-1 cells, which could indicate that MYC is a downstream target of FOXO3A and that the tumor-suppressive properties of FOXO3A may be related to MYC inhibition. Furthermore, there is considerable overlap in the genes regulated by both FOXO3A and MYC, both in those related to growth promotion such as CCND2, CDK4, and CCNE2 and in those related to growth inhibition such as BBC3, CDKN1B, and GADD45A [35, 36], suggesting that the expression of such genes is regulated by both FOXO3A and MYC in an antagonistic manner. We found that FOXO3A silencing did not affect the MYC downregulation induced by DAC, which could explain why FOXO3A silencing Foxo3a could only partially reverse DAC-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in SKM-1 cells.",

High doses of 5-azacitidine (5-AZA; 2 \u03bcM) can reportedly activate FOXO3A and thus upregulate BCL2L11 expression and trigger apoptosis in AML cells [39]. We also observed the induction of BCL2L11 expression using low doses of DAC, although this treatment had no significant effect on FASLG expression.

            "text": "Autophagy, a vital mechanism for maintaining energy balance and metabolic homeostasis in cells, has a dual role in cellular biology that it can promote either cell survival or cell death. The effect of demethylation agents on tumor cell autophagy has been investigated previously, and azacitidine (AZA) treatment was found to induce apoptosis and autophagy in SKM-1 cells [40], with similar observations reported in CML cell lines [41]. In the latter study, autophagy occurred first and it was followed by apoptosis [41]. These studies, together with our results, show that demethylating agents activate cellular stress responses, eventually leading to autophagy and apoptosis. Previously, it was reported that cell death in BCR-ABL-positive CML cells was significantly increased following either treatment with an autophagy inhibitor or the silencing of the autophagy genes ATG5 and ATG7. Furthermore, the simultaneous inhibition of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and autophagy significantly reduced the activity of, and induced apoptosis in, BCR-ABL-positive CML cells, irrespective of whether they were sensitive or resistant to imatinib [42, 43]. Interestingly, silencing LC3 in MDS cell lines significantly increased AZA-induced cell death, indicating that AZA-induced autophagy may be a protective, rather than cytotoxic, mechanism in cells [44] and that the AZA-induced autophagy observed by Cluzeau et al. [40] may not be contributing to cell death. It is possible that the autophagy occurring with other traditional chemotherapy drugs, as with AZA, may constitute a compensatory mechanism to protect cells from drug-induced damage and apoptosis. It is therefore not possible to determine whether the autophagy that is observed in SKM-1 cells in response to DAC treatment is a drug-induced protective stress response or a cytotoxic response.",
