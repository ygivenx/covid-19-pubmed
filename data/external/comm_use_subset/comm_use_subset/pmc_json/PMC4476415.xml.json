Only the strains obtained from clinical samples containing the full length S, RdRp, and N genes retrieved from PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for the years 2003 to 2012 were used (see Supplementary Table S1 on line). A varying population size profile was observed (Fig. 1). The overall plot of OC43 (including genotypes B, C, D and E) showed two large bottlenecks. The first was found between 2006 and 2007, showing a decrease in relative genetic diversity in 2006, followed by an increase in 2007. The second was found between 2008 and 2009, with a transient decrease before 2008, followed by an increase in relative genetic diversity coinciding with a temporal epidemic in population size. Genotype B exhibited a transient increase in 2004, then followed a steady but slowly increased relative genetic diversity, corresponding to global increases in its detection17. Genotype D showed a decreased genetic diversity before 2007, then an increase after 2009, consistent with its dominant epidemic from 2007 to 201217. Genotype C and E both exhibited a short and steady relative genetic diversity during the study period. The history of the relative genetic diversity obtained here corresponds to global epidemic data, indicating that the relative genetic diversity measured by the S gene generally reflects the HCoV-OC43 dynamic in population size. The relative genetic diversity of genotype D corresponded to the two bottlenecks of OC43, indicating that genotype D accounts for much of the genetic diversity of OC43 and is the predominant genotype.",

All but one strain (5445/07) identified after 2007 contained the mutation of Y521H. All the strains identified after 2008 contained the mutation K90L. The mutations L195S and Y521H were found in strains identified between 2008 and 2011, but not in those of 2012. Other mutations, including N33D, T93K, D120H and K184N, were found in several strains.

Genotypes B and D, which have high genetic variability contained more selections sites than that of C and E genotypes. The possible link between the positive selection sites and the genetic variability of genotypes should be evaluated in the future studies. The evaluation of relative genetic diversity, substitution rate, dN/dS value, and positive selection sites further showed that genotype D had a significant influence on the relative genetic diversity of OC43 and that its S gene evolved towards heterogeneity. More positive selection sites were also found in the S1 subunit of genotype D. Amino acid substitutions in the surface proteins are considered an important adaption strategy for the persistence of a virus to evade host immune pressure818. Although the neutralizing epitopes have not been identified, the substitutions identified in the S1 subunit of OC43 in this study are predicted to be in the antigenicity region (data not shown), which may allow viruses to escape host neutralizing antibodies19202122. Collectively, these findings suggest that genetic drift may play an important role in maintaining the spread of genotype D in the human population. Whether the genetic variations affect the related antigenic phenotype will need to be confirmed by antigen analysis using S genes with such mutants.",

It has been reported that a single aa substitution in RBD can cause marked antigenic differences and enable the virus to escape host immunity in influenza virus and norovirus2425. Whether this single aa mutation can influence the host receptor binding activity needs to be investigated further. It is interesting that after 2012, the genotype D strains contained less mutations than those identified before 2012.
