Due to useful ethnomedicinal and pharmacological properties, Rubus species has been used in folk medicine [2]. The leaf extract of R. fairholmianus (R. moluccanus L.) collected in the early morning has been used by Koch-Rajbongshi and Rangia tribes to reduce headache by [3]. The leaves have been reported to possess insecticidal properties; fruits are edible and stimulant [4]. The total phenolic content and antioxidant and analgesic potential of R. fairholmianus extracts have been evaluated by George et al. [5]. R. fairholmianus root acetone extract showed significant anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties which may be due to the presence of analogues of quercetin and other related polyphenolic compounds [6].",

Berry fruits are characterized by a high content and wide diversity of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, organic acids, tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids [15]. Oxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between antioxidant systems and the production of oxidants, which is associated with many diseases like cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and inflammation related disorders [16]. A large number of naturally occurring antioxidant compounds have been identified from different plant sources, as free radical or active oxygen scavengers [17, 18]. Antioxidants protect organisms against free radicals and they are vital to neutralize the destruction caused by the radicals with a sufficient supply of antioxidants [19].",

The phenolic compounds in berries have been well characterized as natural antioxidants, which are believed to play a major role in certain health benefits. The naturally occurring phenolic antioxidants encompass a diverse range of chemical classes that protect against the damage caused by ROS to DNA and membrane and cellular components [33]. The strong antioxidant activities of R. fairholmianus may be due to the phenolic compounds. Previously, Vadivelan et al. [34] reported the antioxidant properties of R. ellipticus root. The root methanol extracts showed strongest radical scavenging activity (IC50: 12.2 \u03bcg/mL) against DPPH\u2219 and (IC50: 2.5 \u03bcg/mL) against ABTS radical. Comparing these results, the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of the isolated column fractions and compounds of R. fairholmianus are highly significant and are almost equivalent and more than that of the standards. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of an allied species R. sanctus has also been reported, which was found to scavenge the DPPH radical by 83.27% compared to vitamin C and BHT (97.15 and 96.47%) [35]. Comparing the literatures, the isolated compounds and fractions of R. fairholmianus root acetone extract have a commendable antioxidant activity in the tested assays.",

The docking score and hydrogen bond interactions of the compounds are showed in Table 3. 1-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one (G score: \u22124.7) has high binding with active site of BRCA1 protein followed by 2-[(3-methylbutoxy) carbonyl] benzoic acid (G score: \u22123.86). The standard drugs such as doxorubicin and letrazole also showed strong binding affinity (G score: \u22124.82 and \u22124.18, resp.). The docking results of BRCA1 revealed that the mode of molecular interactions of the isolated compounds and standard drugs was almost similar (Figure 2). Meanwhile, 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one and 4-methylpentyl benzoate also showed fairly good binding affinities towards the target protein BRCA2 with a G score of \u22124.5 and \u22123.8, respectively. 2-[(3-Methylbutoxy) carbonyl] benzoic acid also docked with a moderate G score (\u22123.1); the binding affinities were found to be more than that of the standards letrazole and paclitaxel (G score: \u22123.0 and \u22122.9). The standard drug doxorubicin showed a G score of \u221211.1 followed by tamoxifen (G score: \u22125.9). Among the 6 isolated compounds, only three compounds were found to have good docking with target protein. The molecular interaction and docking score of the compounds are shown in Table 4 and Figure 3. The molecular docking results showed that the isolated compound 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one is highly significant in binding (G score: \u22124.7) and formed three hydrogen bonds against SER 6: H (HG), GLY 1656: (H) H, and LYS 1702 (H) HZ2 residues of BRCA1. The residues involved in binding were more or less similar with that of standard drugs. The docking score of 2-[(3-methylbutoxy) carbonyl] benzoic acid, 4-methylpentyl benzoate, 2-(5-methylhexyl) benzoic acid, 3-(iminomethyl)-2,4-dimethylphenol, and 3-methylbutyl benzoate compounds ranged between \u22123.4 and \u22123.83 and the docking score of the standard drugs falls between \u22122.0 and \u22124.82. Docking score and H-bond interaction of all 6 isolated compounds were closely related to standard drugs. The docking results of BRCA2 with the isolated compounds 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one and 4-methylpentyl benzoate are significant. 1-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one formed three hydrogen bonds with the ALA 874: (O) O, ALA874: (H) H, and GLY1166: (H) H residues of BRCA2 protein and 4-methylpentyl benzoate formed 2 hydrogen bonds with the ALA 1063: (H) H and LYS 1062 (H) HZ2 residues of BRCA2. Some of the binding residues were common in both standard drugs and the isolated compounds. The G score of isolated compounds ranged between \u22124.5 and \u22123.1, whereas the standard drugs were in between \u221211.1 and \u22123.2. BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose individuals to breast, ovarian, and other cancers. These proteins are required for the maintenance of genetic stability and have function in DNA damage [53]. Previously, Raja et al. [54] studied the docking analysis of mangrove-derived compounds and revealed that, among six compounds triterpenoid, stigma sterol, and pyrethrin were efficient in destroying BRCA1. Saravanakumar and coworkers [55] proposed the docking of fungal metabolites against BRCA1. The docking score of phthalic acid was lowest (\u221213.71 kcal/mol) followed by 2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl acetate and 3-methylcyclopentan-1-ol having the value of \u221211.11 and \u22129.08, respectively. However, there is no report on the docking of isolated compounds from R. fairholmianus against BRCA proteins. So the information gained from this study will be useful for further development of novel breast cancer inhibitors.",

Transcription/antitumor protein BRCA2 contains two chains with a fragment c-terminal WD40 domain having residues 835\u20131186. The synonym is PALB2, Fanconi anemia group n protein. 19-meric peptides have been identified from BRCA2 protein. The second fragment interacts with PALB2 having residues 21\u201339. The early onset protein (BRCA2) is central to the repair of DNA damage. BRCA2 recruits recombinase RAD51 to sites of damage, regulates its assembly into nucleoprotein filaments, and thereby promotes homologous recombination. Localization of BRCA2 to nuclear foci requires its association with the partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), mutations which are associated with cancer predisposition, as well as subtype n of Fanconi anaemia. Oliver et al. [57] have determined the structure of the PALB2 carboxy-terminal beta-propeller domain in complex with a BRCA2 peptide.",

The docking results of isolated compounds with COX-2 are significant when compared with the standard drugs. The G score of the compounds ranged between \u22122.9 and \u22120.4; 2-[(3-methylbutoxy) carbonyl] benzoic acid had the highest G score in the isolated compounds, bound with HID 228: (H) HD1, LYS 543: (H) HZ1, and LYS 543: (H) HZ1 residues of the COX-2 protein.

Recent studies have shown that stellatin has COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities which was isolated from Dysophylla stellata. Docking study revealed the binding orientations of stellatin and its derivatives into COX-1 and COX-2 and thereby helps to design potent inhibitors [58]. Olgen et al. [59] reported the COX inhibitory activities of indomethacin derivatives (N-substituted indole-2-carboxylic acid esters). All the derivatives were shown to be docked at the site where intact flurbiprofen was embedded for COX-1 and s-58 (1-phenylsulphonamide-3-trifluoromethyl-5-para-bromophenylpyrazole) for COX-2. Three series of spiro derivatives have been synthesized and docked to COX-2 by Amin et al. [60]. The results showed nearest value of indomethacin. Abdel-Aziz et al. [61] designed a group of cyclic imides (1\u201313) and evaluated its selective COX-2 inhibition. The molecular docking study showed that the CH3O substituents of 5b were inserted firmly to COX-2, where the O-atoms of such group underwent a H-bonding interaction with HIS 90 (2.43, 2.83 \u00c5), ARG 513 (2.89 \u00c5), and TYR 355 (3.34 \u00c5). This revealed a similar binding mode to SC-558, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Basile and coworkers [62] have synthesised 14 sulfonilamidothiopyrimidone derivatives. Compounds 2\u20135 were able to fit into the active site of COX-2 with highest scores and interaction energies. Furthermore, compound 2, which showed an inhibition of around 50% on PGE2 production, was best scored. El-Sayed et al. [63] designed and synthesized new arylhydrazone derivatives and a series of 1,5-diphenyl pyrazoles from 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4,4-trifuorobutane-1,3-dione 1. The designed compounds docked into the COX-2. Docking study of the synthesized compounds 2f, 6a, and 6d into COX-2 revealed a similar binding mode to SC-558, a selective COX-2 inhibitor.",

[64] reported the crystal structure of COX-1 complex with the inhibitors ibuprofen, methyl flurbiprofen, flurbiprofen, and alclofenac at resolutions ranging from 2.6 to 2.75 A. These structures allow direct comparison of enzyme complexes with reversible competitive inhibitors (ibuprofen and methyl flurbiprofen) and slow tight-binding inhibitors (alclofenac and flurbiprofen). All the inhibitors bind to the same site and adopt similar conformations. In all four complexes, the enzyme structure is essentially unchanged, exhibiting only minimal differences in the inhibitor binding site. The different apparent modes of NSAID binding may result from differences in the speed and efficiency with which inhibitors can disturb the hydrogen bonding network around Arg-120 and Tyr-355. Chou [65] studied the various methods adopted to understand the molecular mechanism of proteins and conduct structure based drug design by timely using the updated information of newly found sequences. He has also reported three main strategies developed in structural bioinformatics, that is, pure energetic approach, heuristic approach, and homology modeling approach, as well as their underlying principles, in a review. These approaches help to understand the action mechanisms of proteins and stimulating the course of drug discovery. In the literature, the binding pocket of a protein receptor to a ligand is usually defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom (i.e., an atom other than hydrogen) with a distance < 5 \u00c5 from a heavy atom of the ligand. Such a criterion was originally used to define the binding pocket of ATP in the Cdk5-Nck5a\u2217 complex [66] and has later proved quite useful in identifying functional domains and stimulating the relevant truncation experiments. The similar approach has also been used to define the binding pockets of many other receptor-ligand interactions important for drug design.",

In this study well known docking program Glide module is used to dock the isolated compounds of R. fairholmianus root acetone and the standard drugs to the active pockets of BRCA and COX target proteins to study the mode of interaction and inhibitory properties. Many marvelous biological functions in proteins and DNA and their profound dynamic mechanisms, such as switch between active and inactive states [67], cooperative effects [68], and allosteric transition [69], can be revealed by studying their internal motions [70]. Likewise, to really understand the action mechanism between a drug compound and its target protein, we should consider not only the static binding structure but also the dynamical information obtained by simulating their internal motions or dynamic process. We will consider this in our future studies.",

No previous reports are available on the compound isolation and other bioactivity studies of this plant. The investigation describes the isolated compounds from acetone extract of R. fairholmianus root docked to the active pockets of BRCA and COX proteins to predict analogous binding mode of the BRCA and COX inhibitors. The results revealed that the compounds were docked more firmly and inhibited the breast cancer related BRCA1 and BRCA2 oncoproteins and COX-2 and COX-1 inflammatory proteins. Among the 6 compounds, 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-methylpentan-1-one and 2-[(3-methylbutoxy) carbonyl] benzoic acid were found to be more active in inhibiting BRCA and COX proteins, which also revealed the better results for antioxidant assays. Therefore, these compounds may be considered as the lead compounds for further development of therapeutic drugs.",
