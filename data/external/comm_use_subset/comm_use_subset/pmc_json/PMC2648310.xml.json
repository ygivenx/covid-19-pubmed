A key step in the reproduction of these pathogens is replication of their single-stranded RNA genomes. This process occurs in the cytosol of host cells in association with membranes and requires a virally-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [1]. During infections, the RdRp associates with other viral and host proteins to form the RNA replicase, which is the complex responsible for synthesizing negative-strand RNA intermediates and progeny viral genomes [2]. The mechanism by which replicase assembly occurs is fundamental to understanding genome replication and is currently the focus of intense study [3].",

Accordingly, these RNA genomes are multifunctional molecules that possess regulatory mechanisms to ensure that these different processes occur accurately and at the proper time during the infectious cycle. Integral to this control is the presence of different regulatory RNA elements within viral genomes that act as signals for modulating molecular events. Traditionally, such RNA elements have been viewed as localized sequences or structures (e.g. RNA hairpins); however, this perspective is rapidly changing due to increasing discoveries of functional viral RNA elements that are formed by long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions spanning significant distances [4]\u2013[9]. Consequently, our structural concept of a functional viral RNA genome is shifting from that of a \u201clinear\u201d molecule to one that is three-dimensional [4].",

The plus-strand RNA genome of TBSV is \u223c4.8 kb long and encodes five functional proteins [11]. The RNA replication-related proteins, p33 and its read-through product p92, are translated directly from the genome, while 3\u2032-proximally encoded open reading frames (ORFs) are translated from two subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that are transcribed during infections (Figure 1A) [10]. Interestingly, translation of p33 and p92 occurs via a 5\u2032 cap- and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail-independent mechanism that involves a long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction between a 3\u2032 cap-independent translational enhancer (3\u2032CITE) in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) and the 5\u2032UTR of the genome [12],[13]. Sg mRNA transcription also requires long-range RNA\u2013based interactions within the TBSV genome that involve sequences immediately upstream from transcriptional start sites and partner sequences far upstream [14]\u2013[16]. Accordingly, TBSV utilizes RNA\u2013RNA interactions spanning thousands of nucleotides in two different essential processes: translation and transcription.",

            "text": "Viral RNA replication in TBSV has been studied extensively in both plant and yeast cells and the latter system has served as a genetically-tractable surrogate host that supports authentic viral RNA replication [2],[10],[17]. Two TBSV proteins are required for viral RNA replication: p92, the RdRp, and p33, an auxiliary protein that plays multiple critical roles [10],[18]. Both of these viral proteins are part of the RNA replicase, and several host proteins have also been determined to be components of this complex [19]\u2013[21]. p33 contains peroxisomal targeting signals and transmembrane segments in its N-terminus [22]. This protein also binds, as a dimer, to an internal RNA element in the TBSV genome termed region II (RII; Figure 1) and recruits the genome to peroxisomal membranes, where active RNA replicase is formed [23],[24]. Only the central portion of RII, an extended stem-loop (SL) structure called RII(+)-SL, is required for p33-dimer binding (Figure 2A). p33 also interacts with p92, thus p92 is recruited into replicase assembly by associating with the p33 dimer bound to RII [25]. Interestingly, in addition to the internally-located RII segment, replicase assembly also requires a 3\u2032-terminal section of the viral genome, termed RIV (Figure 1) [26]. RIV is composed of a series of three RNA SLs, which form a compact structure that is located immediately downstream of the 3\u2032CITE (Figure 2A) [27],[28]. Consequently, two non-contiguous RNA elements in the TBSV genome (RII and RIV), separated by \u223c3,000 nts, are required for viral replicase assembly [26].",

Our results support this theory by identifying a long-range RNA\u2013RNA interaction in the TBSV genome that unites RII and RIV and is essential for efficient replicase assembly and viral RNA replication. This finding, along with previous results, has allowed us to generate an integrated higher-order RNA structural model for functional long-range interactions in the genome of a eukaryotic RNA virus. Mechanistic and evolutionary insights provided by this model are discussed.",

            "text": "Based on the demonstrated requirement for both RII and RIV for replicase assembly in vivo [26], we hypothesized that these two discontinuous RNA elements need to communicate with each other in order to coordinate this event. Considering the abundance of existing long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions in other fundamental tombusvirus processes [4], we entertained the possibility that the RII-RIV communication might also be RNA-mediated. To this end, all sequenced tombusvirus genomes were analyzed by the RNA secondary structure-predicting program mfold [29],[30] in an attempt to identify candidate RNA\u2013RNA interactions. This analysis revealed a potential RNA base pairing interaction involving two 11 nt long sequences, one located in RII and the other in RIII. The sequence in RII was located just 3\u2032 to the essential RII(+)-SL core structure and was termed upstream linker (UL), while its complementary partner sequence in RIII was termed the downstream linker (DL) (Figure 2A). Although the DL in RIII is located some 267 nts away from RIV in the linear RNA sequence, formation of the intervening and experimentally-confirmed Y-shaped domain (i.e. R3.5, which includes the 3\u2032CITE) would position the putative interaction close to RIV in the higher-order RNA structure (Figure 2A) [12],[13],[28]. Thus, the UL\u2013DL interaction would situate RII(+)-SL immediately adjacent to RIV, thereby allowing for communication between these two distal RNA elements. It should be noted that the UL\u2013DL interaction is not a direct interaction between RII and RIV; instead, it could function as an RNA\u2013based bridge that juxtaposes the two RNA elements. The functional relevance of the proposed UL\u2013DL interaction was further supported by comparative sequence analysis of tombusvirus genomes that revealed mono- and co-variations in the two sequences that would either maintain or not significantly disrupt the base pairing interaction (Figure 2B). Accordingly, both thermodynamically-based analysis of secondary structures of full-length viral genomes and comparative sequence analysis of the proposed paired segments support the formation of the UL\u2013DL interaction.",

            "text": "To assess whether the UL\u2013DL interaction was functionally relevant to viral infections, the partner sequences were subjected to compensatory mutational analysis in the context of the TBSV genome. In the genomic mutant T-dU, substitutions were introduced into the UL at wobble positions within the p92 ORF so as not to alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded p92 protein. The changes introduced into T-dU, which were predicted to destabilize the interaction (Figure 3A), reduced genome accumulation levels in plant protoplast infections to \u223c6% that of wt TBSV (Figure 3B, top panel). Similarly, disruptive substitutions in the DL in mutant T-dD reduced genome accumulation levels to \u223c20% that of wt TBSV (Figure 3B). However, when the two sets of disruptive substitutions were combined in mutant T-cUD, so as to restore base pairing potential, genome accumulation levels showed recovery to \u223c69% that of wt TBSV (Figure 3B). These results indicate that the UL\u2013DL interaction is functionally important for efficient TBSV genome accumulation, as well as for robust levels of both sg mRNAs. Additional analysis of these mutants for minus-strand viral RNA accumulation indicated that the interaction is required at an early step in genome and sg mRNA production, because the disruptions inhibited minus-strand synthesis for both of these classes of viral RNA (Figure 3B, lower panel). The findings with TBSV were confirmed by carrying out the same compensatory mutational analysis in the UL\u2013DL interaction in another tombusvirus, Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) (Figure 3C). It was also noted, for both viruses, that the dD mutants containing two central UG wobble pairs were \u223cthree- to fourfold more active than the corresponding dU mutants with CA mismatches (Figure 3B, C, upper panels). This difference suggests that the UL\u2013DL interactions are functionally relevant in the plus-strands of these viral genomes (refer to Figure 3A legend for additional information).",

            "text": "The above results indicated a defect at an early step in viral RNA synthesis. One possible explanation for this is that the UL\u2013DL interaction acts to facilitate translation of the RNA replication proteins p33 and p92 from the viral genome. Inhibition of this function would lead to lower levels of viral RNA replication and reduced RNA genome accumulation. Notably, the UL\u2013DL interaction is positioned directly adjacent to the 3\u2032CITE, a location that could potentially aid it in regulating 3\u2032CITE activity (Figure 2A). To address this possibility, the same set of genomic mutants that was analyzed in Figure 3C was assessed in a wheat germ translation extract. CIRV was used for this analysis as, unlike TBSV, its 3\u2032CITE is fully active in this plant-derived in vitro system [31], as illustrated by the significant decrease in translation observed in its absence (i.e. mutant CIRV\u0394TE in Figure 4A). In the translation assay, the level of p36, the homologue of p33 in TBSV, was monitored for the wt CIRV genome and each of its mutants. In general, the viral genomes yielded similar levels of p36, suggesting roughly equivalent efficiencies of translation (Figure 4A). This conclusion was supported by stability analysis of these messages, which showed comparable profiles of RNA decay (Figure 4B). Taken together, these data indicate that the UL\u2013DL interaction does not markedly affect translation of viral proteins.",

            "text": "The lack of involvement of the UL\u2013DL interaction in translation prompted us to refocus our attention to its possible role in directly mediating viral RNA replication. As proposed earlier, the interaction could function simply to juxtapose RII and RIV. However, the potential exists that the RNA helix formed by the UL\u2013DL interaction also contributes to the activity. To investigate this possibility, two mutant TBSV genomes were generated. The first mutant, CorP1, contained the UL and DL sequences, but lacked the intervening sequence between these two partner segments (Figure 5A). To facilitate formation of the UL\u2013DL interaction, the intervening sequence deleted in CorP1 was replaced by a stable GNRA-type tetraloop. In the second mutant, CorP2, the UL and DL sequences, along with their intervening sequence, were removed (Figure 5A). Both CorP mutants were defective for autonomous replication, because they encoded C-terminally truncated p92 ORFs. Consequently, replication of these viral RNAs had to be complemented with a genomic RNA, AS1m1, which provided full-length p92 in trans. AS1m1 does not transcribe sg mRNA1, due to a mutation in its RNA\u2013based transcriptional signal [15], and it was used as the helper genome so as to avoid obscuring the detection of the CorP RNAs, which have lengths that are similar to that of sg mRNA1. The results from co-transfection of AS1m1 with CorP1 into plant protoplasts revealed readily detectable accumulation of the latter; however, the corresponding co-transfection containing CorP2 resulted in significantly higher levels of accumulation of the CorP2 replicon (Figure 5B). The efficient accumulation of the viral replicon lacking the UL\u2013DL interaction indicates that the RNA helix formed by the interaction is not necessary for function and may in fact be somewhat inhibitory to efficient viral RNA replication (though this effect could be related to its stable hairpin context in CorP1). Regardless, these results support the notion that the primary role of the interaction is to mediate the juxtaposition of RII and RIV.",

Replicon DI-73 was selected for these studies as it contains both RII and a contiguous 3\u2032 end containing RIII-R3.5-RIV, thereby providing a potentially suitable context to study the UL\u2013DL interaction (Figure 1B) [32]. To validate that the UL\u2013DL interaction was functionally important for its accumulation, the same set of compensatory mutations that was tested in the TBSV genome (Figure 3A) was introduced into DI-73. As observed for the full-length TBSV genome, the disruptive mutations (mutants 73dU and 73dD) led to substantially reduced DI-73 levels of accumulation in plant protoplast co-transfections with helper genome, while restoration of the interaction (mutant 73cUD) led to notably recovered levels of accumulation, both at the plus- and minus-strand levels (Figure 6A and 6B). These results show that even though the UL and DL in DI-73 are separated by only 70 nts, the formation of the interaction is still required. This indicates that the UL\u2013DL interaction is needed to mediate a specific RNA arrangement that is required for optimal function. To determine if the differences in replicon accumulation were related to changes in RNA stability, stability assays were carried out (Figure 6C). No major differences in RNA decay rates were observed, suggesting that the UL\u2013DL-related defect was related to RNA replication efficiency.",

One possible explanation is that the interaction facilitates folding of the plus-strand viral RNA templates into conformations that are suitable for minus-strand synthesis. To test this idea, DI-73 replicons harboring the compensatory mutations in the interaction were tested in vitro for their ability to serve as templates for minus-strand synthesis using a tombusvirus replicase extract derived from plants [17]. All of the RNA templates tested directed the synthesis of terminally-initiated (ti) minus strands with similar efficiencies (Figure 6D). Internally-initiated (ii) products, commonly observed in such in vitro systems, were, for the most part, also produced at similar levels. These results indicate that the UL\u2013DL interaction neither promotes more efficient minus-strand synthesis by assembled replicase nor acts to redirect internal initiation sites to the 3\u2032-terminus. Accordingly, the UL\u2013DL-related function may act at a step in the RNA replication pathway that precedes minus-strand synthesis.",

            "text": "A possible early step in viral RNA replication that could require the UL\u2013DL interaction is replicase assembly. This concept relates back to our original hypothesis that RII and RIV, the only two discontinuous RNA regions required for this process, need to communicate in order to function. Importantly, the juxtaposition of RII and RIV by the UL\u2013DL interaction would satisfy this proposed condition. To address this possibility, a well-defined tombusvirus replicase assembly assay utilizing a yeast-based system was employed [26]. Before carrying out the replicase assembly assay, the DI-73-based compensatory mutants were tested in an in vivo replication assay to determine if the results observed in plant cells could be accurately recapitulated in yeast cells [33]. This replication assay involved expressing p33, p92, and the DI-73 replicon transcript from cotransformed plasmids and monitoring the accumulation of the RNA replicon by northern blot analysis. The relative levels of accumulation of the different viral replicons in yeast were similar to those observed in plant protoplasts, thereby validating use of the yeast system for further investigation (Figure 7A). For the assembly assay, replicase was purified from yeast cells (transformed as described above) and then assayed for its ability to synthesize a complementary strand to an exogenously added viral RNA template, DI-72(\u2212). DI-72(\u2212) is a negative-sense viral RNA and does not contain the UL\u2013DL interaction. Results from this assay showed that the added DI-72(\u2212) RNA template was copied efficiently only in extracts that were isolated from cells containing DI-73 replicons that retained a functional UL\u2013DL interaction (i.e. Y73 and Y73cUD; Figure 7B). Western blot analysis indicated that equal levels of p33 were expressed in the cells used for replicase purification (Figure 7C). Next, as a more stringent test of assembly, the wt and compensatory set of DI-73 mutants were modified at their 5\u2032 ends so as to make them replication-defective; as verified by the replication assay (Figure 7D). Under these conditions, DI-73 levels would be similarly low for both wt and mutant forms, thus reducing the effect of replicon levels on the efficiency of replicase assembly. When the replicase assembly assay was carried out under these more strict conditions, a similar trend was observed, where assembly was more efficient when the UL\u2013DL interaction was predicted to be stable (Figure 7E). Collectively, these data indicate that the UL\u2013DL interaction contributes to the efficiency of replicase assembly.",

            "text": "Different mechanistic variants can be envisioned for how the UL\u2013DL interaction facilitates assembly of the replicase by forming a discontinuous RNA platform. The three schemes presented here, however, are neither exhaustive nor necessarily mutually exclusive; moreover, hybrid versions are also possible. Scheme 1: The UL\u2013DL interaction forms first and allows proteins to associate with either RII or RIV; protein-protein interactions then mediate replicase assembly. Scheme 2: The juxtaposed RII and RIV together form a discontinuous binding site that recruits an important component(s) necessary for replicase assembly. Scheme 3: Protein factors bind to the individual non-united RII and RIV elements; the UL\u2013DL interaction then juxtaposes the bound factors, which mediates replicase assembly. With respect to the latter scheme, studies have shown that viral p33 is able to bind in vitro to RII(+)-SL in the absence of other RNA elements [24]. This suggests that, for at least some factors, formation of the UL\u2013DL interaction may not need to precede protein binding. Also, as p92 associates with RII by interacting with p33 [24],[25] (Figure 8A), a secondary function for the UL\u2013DL interaction may be to reposition the internally-bound p92 RdRp close to the 3\u2032 terminus of the RNA genome, thereby allowing it to efficiently initiate minus-strand synthesis (Figure 8A). This function, however, does not seem necessary for assembled replicase, as such complexes were able to effectively initiate minus-strand synthesis in vitro irrespective of the UL\u2013DL interaction and the interaction did not facilitate more efficient terminal initiation (Figure 6D). Nonetheless, if replicase assembly is tightly coupled to minus-strand synthesis in vivo, it is possible that the UL\u2013DL interaction also mediates 3\u2032-end positioning of the p92 RdRp. Indeed, this type of repositioning mechanism has been implicated in facilitating the function of an RNA hairpin enhancer element present in the minus-strand of a small TBSV defective interfering RNA [34].",

            "text": "Interestingly, RdRp-positioning roles for long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interactions have also been proposed for two different plus-strand RNA viruses that infect animal and bacterial hosts. For Dengue virus (DenV), an RNA\u2013based interaction spanning \u223c11,000 nts in its genome has been proposed to reposition the viral RdRp, bound to its 5\u2032-proximal promoter, close to the 3\u2032-end of the genome; thereby allowing it to efficiently initiate minus-strand synthesis [35] (Figure 8B). Similarly for Q-beta bacteriophage, the viral replicase was shown to bind to an internal site in the RNA genome that is juxtaposed to the 3\u2032-terminus by an RNA-mediated interaction spanning \u223c1000 nts [36] (Figure 8B). Long-range genomic RNA\u2013RNA interactions involved in viral RNA replication are thus prevalent and include viruses that infect organisms from three different kingdoms (Figure 8B). Interestingly, all three of these viruses belong to the supergroup-II class of RdRps [37], which suggests that in addition to having a common polymerase ancestry, they also share a history of employing long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interactions in their RNA replication processes. Possible selective advantages for separating codependent RNA replication elements throughout a viral genome have been reported [35], e.g. preferentially facilitating the amplification of full-length RNA templates, and such advantages may also be relevant to TBSV. However, TBSV is distinct from both DenV and Q-beta phage in that it produces 3\u2032-coterminal sg mRNAs (Figure 1A). Notably, these sg mRNAs do not include RII in their structure, a feature that would preclude replicase formation on these messages and could act to prevent interference with their primary function of viral protein translation. Accordingly, the underlying principles behind spatially separating functional RNA elements are likely varied and are undoubtedly influenced by viral reproductive strategy.",

Importantly, this finding has allowed us to generate a comprehensive higher-order RNA structural model of functional long-range interactions in the genome of this eukaryotic RNA virus (Figure 9B). This model effectively illustrates that the different interactions are highly integrated and thus require a significant level of coordination in order to function properly (Figure 9B). Indeed, the newly identified UL\u2013DL interaction places replication elements RII and RIV close to both translational (i.e. 3\u2032CITE/5\u2032UTR) and transcriptional (i.e. AS1/RS1 and AS2/RS2) RNA elements (Figure 9B). Thus, if all of the long-range interactions were to occur at once, as is depicted in Figure 9B, they would form a core of regulatory RNA elements. Notably, the large intervening segments, which are primarily coding regions, are predicted by mfold to form discrete domains (Figure S1). Based on this proposed configuration, the different regulatory RNA elements (and any associated proteins) could potentially communicate directly with each other in a common zone that could be used for coordinating different viral processes and/or sharing protein factors (Figure 9B).",

Accordingly, each of the different types of functional long-range RNA\u2013based interactions would need to be dynamic and able to form in parallel with this series of events. Mechanistically, some of these interactions are predicted to be inhibitory to others and, accordingly, some processes may be impeded by others. Such relationships could be integral to coordinating different events or may simply act as safe-guards to prevent two processes from occurring simultaneously. For example, the UL\u2013DL interaction would be inhibited by translation that is mediated by the 5\u2032-3\u2032 SL3-SLB interaction, because ribosomes translating the read-through portion of the p92 ORF would disrupt the UL\u2013DL interaction (as well as the RII structure) (Figure 9B). Conversely, minus-strand synthesis of the genome, which is mediated by the UL\u2013DL interaction, would cause the actively copying RdRp to disrupt the translation-related SL3-SLB interaction (as well as the 3\u2032CITE structure), thereby inhibiting translation (Figure 9B), as has been proposed for Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) [38]. Such incompatibilities could serve regulatory functions and aid the virus in switching from one process to another (e.g. translation to replication; [38]). In other cases, interactions, such as the UL\u2013DL replication-related interaction and the AS-RS transcription-related interactions, may be mechanistically compatible, because both of the associated viral processes require the RdRp and initiation of minus-strand synthesis [39]. The higher-order RNA genome structural model in Figure 9 serves to illustrate an extraordinary level of integration of long-range RNA\u2013based contacts and extends our fundamental view of RNA virus genome structure and function. Importantly, it also provides a useful molecular framework for future studies aimed at unraveling the dynamic regulatory interplay between these diverse sets of interactions.",

Similar types of distal RNA networks have also been reported in other positive-strand RNA viruses. For instance, the luteovirus BYDV utilizes two distinct sets of long-range RNA\u2013based interactions for mediating translational initiation [40] and readthrough [38]. The requirement for base pairing between terminal genomic UTRs for efficient translation was shown initially in BYDV [40] and subsequently in TBSV [12],[13]. Interestingly, a recent report on the nepovirus Blackcurrant reversion virus distinguishes it as an additional virus confirmed to have this terminal pairing requirement [41]. In contrast, translational regulation in the bacteriophage MS2 involves internally located RNA\u2013based interactions that modulate internal initiation events [42]. Accordingly, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosome function can be modulated by the activity of this type of RNA interaction.",

Using the above constructs, and the infectious clone of CIRV [62], additional viral mutants were made and the relevant modifications are presented in the accompanying figures. For yeast-based experiments, the p33- and p92-expression constructs pGBK-His33 and pGAD-His92 have been described previously [33]. The newly generated DI-73 containing plasmids (Y73 series; Figure 7) were based on pYES-DI-72(+)Rz [33] and expressed full-length DI-73(+) RNA transcripts in yeast cells. The corresponding replication-defective mY73 series contained substitutions in RI that are described elsewhere (see mutant m2 in Figure 6 in [63]). All modifications were made using PCR-based mutagenesis and standard cloning techniques [64]. The PCR-derived regions in the constructs were sequenced completely to ensure that only the intended modifications were present.",
