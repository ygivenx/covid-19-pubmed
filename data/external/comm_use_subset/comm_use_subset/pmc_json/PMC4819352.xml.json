The organism is classified into five toxinotypes (A to E) based on the production of four major toxins, namely alpha (cpa), beta (cpb), epsilon (etx), and iota (itx). C. perfringens Type A is implicated in ovine and caprine enterotoxemia in some parts of the world. The cpb2 producing C. perfringens Type A has also been linked to disease in several animal species, including sheep and goats and poultry [2,3].",

The enzyme concentration of 1.0 \u00b5l was found to be optimum for LAMP reaction in the present study (Figure-2). Same concentration of the Bst DNA polymerase enzyme was used by earlier workers for successful LAMP reaction for amplification of Bordetella pertussis, Capri poxviruses viral genome [6,12,13]. The outer primers concentration of 10 pmol/\u00b5l and 160 pmol/\u00b5l of inner primers (FIP and BIP) were found to be optimum for LAMP reaction in the present study (Figure-3). Similar combinations of outer and inner primers were successfully used previously for detection of enterotoxigenic C. perfringens from meat samples [14]. The double strandard DNA in LAMP reaction mixture will be in dynamic equilibrium at the temperature around 65\u00b0C and one of the LAMP primers could anneal to the complimentary sequence to initiate LAMP reaction. Hence, heat denaturation of the double strandard DNA into a single strand, like with PCR was not recommended in LAMP reaction [5]. However, initial denaturation step of template DNA was added in the present study to increase the reaction efficiency as recommended by several previous workers [6,12,13,15-17]. To confirm that the amplification product had corresponding DNA sequences in the present investigation, the amplified product was digested with restriction enzyme XmnI. The enzyme produced single cut at 81 bp within specific recognition sequences in the LAMP amplified product of size 162 bp (Figure-4). The product size was visualized as single band (Figure-5), similar methods were adopted by previous authors to test the specificity of the LAMP products during the amplification of west nile virus and coronovirus genome [6,10,17]. Out of 120 samples screened by LAMP for alpha toxin specific primers 112 (93.30%) samples showed amplification of alpha toxin gene in the samples. Similarly, PCR using 24 h broth culture of fecal samples collected from lambs revealed amplification of alpha toxins gene in all LAMP positive samples indicating similar sensitivity of LAMP and PCR. A similar type of comparison between reverse transcription (RT)-LAMP and RT-PCR was made and it was shown that RT-LAMP was more sensitive than RT-PCR for detection of SARS corona virus from the clinical sample [17]. Though LAMP was said to be having advantages over PCR, the inability of multiplexing in LAMP for simultaneous amplification of more than one gene which is possible with multiplex PCR cannot be over ruled [18]. Moreover, PCR is a basic technique of DNA amplification with several variants and potential applications in molecular biology apart from its use as a simple diagnostic tool.",

The test could be a suitable alternative to the PCR in detection of toxin types without help of sophisticated machinery like thermal cycler. Considering LAMPs simplicity in operation and high sensitivity, the test can be used for clinical diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases. To achieve these levels in resource-poor endemic areas, specimen processing methods, and a closed amplification and detection system need to be developed. This will facilitate the provision of a same-day testing strategy in even the most remote rural health facilities.",
