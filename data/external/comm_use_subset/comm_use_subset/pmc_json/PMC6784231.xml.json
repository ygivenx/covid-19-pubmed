They have a global distribution and, thanks to their ability to fly long distances, are capable of migrating across biological and geographical borders and over broad spatial scales [1,3]. Because of these characteristics, birds play an important role in the dispersal of microbes and, therefore, influence microbial dynamics, impacting the ecology and evolution of various viruses and bacteria [3,4,5].

In particular, RNA viral diversity can be high in the avian reservoirs, as exemplified by AIV [7] and coronaviruses [9]. Furthermore, recent virus discovery studies have highlighted how our knowledge about viral diversity in birds is still limited, with many novel RNA viruses discovered in different avian hosts [10,11,12]. Considering the vast geographic territory birds occupy and the richness of avian species, many more yet unknown viruses likely exist in birds in different environments.",

Within the genus Metapneumovirus (family Pneumoviridae), the species Avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) is a paraphyletic group encompassing viruses known to infect birds. This species officially includes four subgroups (A to D) with AMPV-C being more closely related to viruses within the species Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) than to other AMPVs [14]. A recent study also reported the identification of a potentially novel subgroup [15]. Avian metapneumoviruses are significant poultry pathogens as they cause an acute respiratory disease in turkeys, known as rhinotracheitis, and are one of the factors involved in swollen head syndrome in chickens [16]. AMPV has a worldwide distribution, except for Australia where it has never been documented [17], but the various subgroups are distributed differently. For example, subtype C has a global distribution, but only two subtypes have ever been found in North America, AMPV-C and the newly identified and yet unclassified subtype [15,18]. AMPV RNA has been identified in various wild birds, such as ducks, geese, gulls, starlings, and others [15,18,19,20,21,22].",

Although both genera include a variety of viruses of wild birds, the most studied avian coronaviruses are those within the genus Gammacoronavirus, as they are a cause for great concern for the poultry industry worldwide. In fact, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a gammacoronavirus within the subgenus Igacovirus, can cause a severe respiratory disease in domestic fowl, associated sometimes with nephritis and urogenital complications, with significant mortality [25]. Viruses belonging to the same species as IBV (Avian coronavirus) have been found worldwide in other avian hosts, such as turkey, where coronaviruses cause severe enteritis [26], ducks, gulls, and others [9,24,27,28,29,30,31]. Finally, recent studies have discovered that other igacoviral species exist in birds [32,33,34].",

Caliciviruses have non-enveloped virions whose capsid, formed by the two structural proteins VP1 and VP2, encloses a molecule of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA [35]. The first avian caliciviruses were identified in poultry, but so far, no clear links with disease have been established [36,37,38,39]. Currently, avian caliciviruses are classified within the two genera Bavovirus (species: Bavaria virus) and Nacovirus (species: Nacovirus A), two viral clades that are monophyletic and whose closest relatives are members of the genus Sapovirus [35,37]. However, recent studies have determined that the diversity of avian caliciviruses is higher than anticipated and several novel viral species, and possibly genera, have been identified in various avian hosts, including geese, ducks, shorebirds, and others [12,40,41,42].",

All samples were collected within the city of St John\u2019s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. St. John\u2019s is an isolated urban center, at the eastern edge of North America. Agriculture is limited in the region, but a modern (high biosecurity) poultry operation operates in the area. The local wild avifauna is typical of northern and productive marine areas, and aquatic species that are comfortable with human interaction (ducks and gulls) are abundant in the city. Gull samples were collected in 2015 at a regional landfill and ducks were sampled in 2015 and 2014 at two different ponds. This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The protocol was approved by the Memorial University Institutional Animal Care Committee (approved protocols 13-01-AL and 14-01-AL). Live birds were captured under federal authority (Canadian Wildlife Service Migratory Bird Banding Permit 10559). Samples, all AIV-negative, were paired individual oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs (polyester swabs, Starplex Scientific), submerged together in 3 mL viral transport medium (Starswab Multitrans System, Starplex Scientific). Samples were kept frozen until processing.",

ViDiT is an ultra-low-cost random-PCR-based library preparation method for metagenomic investigations that includes: An initial sample pre-treatment to eliminate unwanted background, a retro-transcription reaction to generate cDNA from RNA, an amplification with tailed random octamers, two final amplification rounds for library completion and enrichment, and Ion Torrent sequencing. Viral sequences identified with CACTUS, a Python-based wrapper script that handles PHRAP-based read assembly and BLASTn- and DIAMOND-based sequence taxonomy assignment, were used in this study as templates for primer design. To extend viral sequence information or obtain the complete viral genome, these primers were used to connect identified viral fragments by specific PCRs or to perform genome walking with the ViDiWa method as previously described [5], followed by Sanger sequencing. ViDiWa is a ViDiT-based nested-PCR method that uses tailed random octamers in combination with virus-specific primers to amplify unknown genomic regions flanking known sequences. An attempt was made to obtain the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 termini of the novel viruses with 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 RACE (5\u2019RACE System, 3\u00b4 RACE System, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the 5\u2019 termini of the gull metapneumovirus was obtained by a PCR involving a strain specific primer and an equimolar mixture of primers designed based on conserved terminal sequences of other AMPVs (Meta_End1: GAATGTATACGGTTTTTTTGCCGT; Meta_End2: GGATGAATACGGTTTTTTTGCCGT; Meta_End3: TGATGAATACGGTTTTTTTCTCGT).",

However, while AMPV PAR-05 was more closely related to the other avian viruses (average pairwise identity: 66.6%), GuMPV B29 seemed to be more closely related to the other clade (average pairwise identity: 69.3% vs. 65%) (Supplementary Figure S1). Similar results were obtained with the other genomic regions (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, while the complete genomic characterization of the novel GuMPV B29 virus supports its classification within the species Avian metapneumovirus, protein sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that it is clearly distant from all other known subgroups and it can be considered the first member of a new subgroup. Our discovery therefore increases the number of known AMPV subgroups to six.",

One GuMPV\u2013GuCoV co-infection was found. The complete sequence of the F gene was obtained for the virus infecting the herring gull and this was 99.8% identical to the strain identified in the original great black-backed gull. Three mutations, two of which were synonymous, distinguished the two strains. However, the same mutations were found in another partial F sequence obtained for a virus recovered in another great black-backed gull, while the remaining two partial F sequences were 100% identical to the original strain. Thus, we concluded that all of these gulls were infected with the same viral type.",

Furthermore, AMPV RNA was identified in a few ring-billed gulls found dead on a Minnesota turkey farm with a known history of AMPV [19], while HMPV-C was found in 22 European common gulls (L. canus) [20]. Our study further confirms gulls as AMPV hosts and indicates great black-backed and American herring gulls are additional host species. We also demonstrate that these viruses can spread among co-existing gull species and highlight how gulls may harbor a hidden viral diversity that deserves further investigation.",

Typically, the genome of avian coronaviruses is about 27\u201332 Kb in length and includes two short UTRs and six main ORFs, including those for the replicase gene on the 5\u2019 end (the two overlapping 1a and 1b ORFs), and those for the structural proteins on the 3\u2019 end, plus several accessory genes [23]. Unfortunately, we were only able to obtain a partial genomic sequence (approximately 10 Kb), which encompassed almost the entire sequence of the 1a ORF. Further attempts to extend the sequence, including genome walking and 5\u2019 RACE experiments, were unsuccessful. The replicase gene is normally translated into a polyprotein that is post-transcriptionally processed by virus-encoded proteases into 15 mature non-structural proteins (nsps) [23]. The partial sequence obtained for GuCoV B29 encompassed the first six proteins (nsp1/2 through nsp7) and, by exploiting the relatively high conservation of the polyprotein sequence, we were able to identify putative cleavage sites [34,54,55,56] and predict the sequence of the mature peptides (Figure 2). Finally, within the obtained sequences, we were able to localize two of the seven conserved replicase domains used for viral classification: The ADP-ribose 1-\u201cphosphatase (ADRP) domain in nsp3 and the 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), which corresponds to nsp5 [57,58,59].",

The obtained phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) included the two main clades representing the two currently defined gammacoronaviral subgenera, one of the viruses infecting marine mammals (Cegacovirus) and the other viruses infecting birds (Igacovirus). GuCoV B29 was located between these two clades, similar to two other recently discovered avian coronaviruses, the DdCoV and the Canada goose coronavirus (CGCoV), both proposed as novel species within the genus [33,34]. This tree topology was conserved when phylogenetic analyses were performed with the whole available polyprotein sequence, but not when the two replicase domains were used separately (Supplementary Figure S3). In fact, within the ADRP domain, GuCoV B29 and DdCoV formed a highly supported clade. When the 3CLpro region was used, DdCoV was included within the main Igacovirus clade, while GuCoV B29 still clustered separately (Supplementary Figure S3).

However, 5\u2019 RACE was unsuccessful, and the 5\u2019-terminal sequence remains undetermined. The obtained sequence was approximately 8.2 Kb and DuCV-2 B6 presented a genomic structure similar to what has been reported for other avian caliciviruses, with two main ORFs, the first one encoding a large polyprotein that undergoes cleavage by a virus-encoded protease to generate several mature nonstructural proteins as well as the major structural protein VP1, and the second one coding for the structural protein VP2 [35]. Additionally, we obtained a partial genomic sequence, covering 90% of the polyprotein sequence and the full VP2 sequence, of an additional strain detected in an American black duck (DuCV-2 B76).",

The helicase/NTPase motif GXPGXGKT was identified in all avian caliciviruses, except for one of the turnstone caliciviruses (MH453861), and was identical in both of our sequenced strains (GPPGIGKT). The 3C-like cysteine protease motif G(D/Y)CGXP was highly conserved in all avian viruses and identical in the two sequenced strains (GDCGLP). Finally, we were able to identify the three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) motifs: DYSKWDST, which was present in most viruses as DY(S/K)(K/G)WDST and in the two DuCVs-2 as DYKKWDST, and GLPSG and YGDD, which were 100% conserved among all viruses.

The novel identified viruses (DuCV-2 B6 and B76) clustered within one of the caliciviral clades that includes avian viruses, specifically in a clade that also includes the goose, chicken, and turkey caliciviruses classified within the genus Nacovirus (Figure 3). Specifically, the DuCV-2 sequences are included in a highly supported clade that includes the nacovirus goose calicivirus and two viruses recently reported in pink-eared ducks (Malacorhynchus membranaceus) [42] (within clade pairwise identity 45\u201397%). Overall, two main groups of avian viruses could be observed in the tree and the biggest of these clades, including 13 viruses, among which were those classified as nacoviruses, comprised viruses that were more closely related to each other than to other viruses (average within-group pairwise identity 46.9% vs. average between-groups identity 31.8%), suggesting they could represent a unique genus [35]. Interestingly, viruses identified in the bird family Anatidae (ducks and geese) could be observed in various branches of the tree (pink eared duck: PeDuCV; duck: DuCVs; goose: GoCVs; grey teal: GtCV; shelduck: SdCV). Phylogenetic trees built with the other genomic regions (VP2 and the nonstructural region of the viral polyprotein, Supplementary Figure S4) showed the same clade of anatine viruses composed of DuCVs-2, GoCV, and PeCVs, although bootstrap support for this clade was low in the VP2 tree.",

However, 10 of these variable sites in VP1 were due to polymorphisms within the black duck virus itself, highlighted by the presence of double-peaks in the electropherograms, indicating either intra-host mutations or co-infection by two or more strains.

One virus was identified in a pool of samples from different individuals and another one was identified in a grey teal (A. gracilis) and both samples were collected from birds in Southern Australia [12,42]. These two viruses, according to our analyses, are not the closest relative to DuCV-2 B6, suggesting the presence of several different viral lineages in ducks. Furthermore, avian caliciviruses have been identified in China [40,68,69], Germany [38,39], Australia [12,42], and Brazil [41] and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of avian caliciviruses in wild birds of North America.",

Although follow-up studies are required to determine additional aspects of their ecology and distribution, the discovery of these viruses, divergent from currently known avian strains and representing novel taxa, increases our knowledge about avian virus diversity and host ranges. Each one of the viruses identified in this study was observed in different related bird species, indicating limited host-specificity. Our results highlight one more time the limited knowledge about avian and, more generally, animal virology and show how a multitude of yet unknown viruses exist, even in species that are frequently subjects of metagenomic investigations.",
