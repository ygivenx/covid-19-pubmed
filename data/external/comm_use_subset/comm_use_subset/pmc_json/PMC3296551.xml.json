ALV has been classified into 10 subgroups, designated A-J. The subgroup J virus (ALV-J) is a relatively new strain of ALV that was isolated from Dorking fowl in the early 1990s [1]. ALV is an RNA virus with a genome of approximately 7.6 kb. The proviral genome of ALV-J contains three major genes, gag, pol, and env, which encode the viral structural proteins, RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, and the envelope glycoprotein, respectively.",

It has been demonstrated that some genes inhibited by siRNAs, such as p24, vif, nef, tat, and rev, can block Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in cells [2]. The infection of cells by HIV may be hindered by inhibiting the expression of the HIV receptors CD4 and CD8a, their coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5, or the virus Gag structural protein [3]. In some studies, transfection of siRNA designed to target C virus (HCV) remarkably inhibited the expression of virus-specific proteins and protected cells against HCV RNA, in vitro [4,5]. In another study, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication was successfully inhibited after plasmid expression of HBV siRNA transfected into mouse liver [6]. Hu et al. [7] adopted siRNA designed against the ALV gag gene and demonstrated significantly reduced virus replication. Chen et al. [8] indicated that ALV-B replication was significantly inhibited after knockdown of the ALV-B tvb and env genes.",

First, RNAi has sequence specificity. Second, the application of multi-series RNAi can target different genes or sequences simultaneously and hence can minimize the possibility of the virus acquiring mutations that confer resistance. Third, RNAi can be transmitted from non-pathogenic viruses to pathogenic viruses. Finally, due to its sequence specificity, siRNA designed against a virus can only inhibit that virus, leaving vaccine strains unaffected. To ensure a high level of RNAi gene silencing, multiple miRNAs can be designed. These can be transfected into cells using the same transfer medium, and by targeting different sequences, mutation of the target virus, and therefore the probability of evasion from the silencing effect of the miRNA is minimized.",

The gag and pol genes are highly conserved, sharing 96-97% homology in ALV-J, in contrast to subgroups A, C, and D. The pol gene mainly encodes the reverse transcriptase (RT; P68) and viral integrase (IN; P32). RT is responsible for the production of proviral DNA using viral RNA as a template, while IN is involved in the integration of proviral DNA into the host genome. The pol gene is necessary for reverse transcription of the RNA genome and the generation of viral DNA, and it is a key to the insertion of the viral genome into the host genome. RNAi has been applied to the inhibition of ALV replication by a number of research groups. Chen et al.

These results showed that miRNA expression could inhibit the duplication of the target gag gene, with mi-gag1318 having the highest inhibitory effect.

These miRNAs were grouped in pairs or together, and the tandem multi-target miRNAs target mi-g1318-p2516, mi-g1318-e1384, mi-p2516-e1384, and mi-g1318-p2516-e1384 were co-expressed, reducing the probability of evasion from the silencing effect of the miRNA due to virus mutation. When multiple miRNAs were expressed simultaneously, gene silencing was shown to be more effective. Tandem plasmids were transfected into DF-1 cells and then infected with ALV-J. IFA, western blotting, and quantitative PCR were used to evaluate the inhibiting effects on ALV-J replication at the cellular level. The results verified that all of the tandem plasmids could effectively inhibit the replication of ALV in DF-1 cells, with an inhibition efficiency of 85-91.2%. The enhanced inhibitory effects conferred by the multi-target miRNA expression plasmids demonstrated that the multi-target miRNAs could inhibit ALV synergistically.",
