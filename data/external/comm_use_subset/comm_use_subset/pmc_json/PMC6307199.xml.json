Since the first AIDS case was reported in early 1980\u2019s, China had initiated a set of measures to combat this emerging health problem. HIV and AIDS surveillance started in 1985. In 1995, the China Ministry of Health and the National Center for AIDS established 42 national sentinel sites in 23 of the 31 provinces [4]. However, the system had issues related to its accessibility and accuracy, which hampered timely understanding of the HIV and AIDS epidemic pattern and effectiveness of HIV and AIDS prevention measures.",

The notifiable infectious diseases were divided into Classes A, B and C. According to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act, all epidemic reports are time-sensitive. All Class A infectious diseases as well as pulmonary anthrax and SARS in Class B should be reported through the system within 2 h after diagnosis, and other disease in Class B and Class C infectious diseases should be reported within 24 h after diagnosis. As a result, the date of diagnosis and reporting is the same day. We extracted HIV and AIDS data from 2004 and 2014 from the Science Data Center of Public Health (http://www.phsciencedata.cn). AIDS patients in our study were those who had a previous HIV diagnosis, which had been identified or not, and then progressed to late stage.",

As linear trends were observed in most provinces and age groups, a linear model was applied for incidence data on the logit scale. Relative changes in HIV and AIDS incidence or mortality were presented by odds ratio (OR) as compared with 2004. In addition, we also calculated average annual percentage change (AAPC) in HIV and AIDS RIs [12]. All analyses were conducted using R (version 3.3.3).",

First, since the data were retrieved from a passive surveillance system, there might be some under reporting, especially during earlier years of the system. Second, the incidence could also be underestimated because of ascertainment bias by self-selection that individuals at high risk of HIV and AIDS were more reluctant to screening. Third, the increase of HIV and AIDS reporting incidence among older adults might be ascribed to the detection of long-standing infections, though more investigations should be warranted in the near future. Finally, key affected populations (e.g. the men who have sex with men) have not been particularized in our study due to the inaccessibility of corresponding surveillance data.",

The China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) is currently the largest web-based surveillance system in the world, and it stores the nationwide validated reporting data daily. Despite these challenges, our analysis is based on a large sample of people diagnosed with HIV and AIDS across 31 provinces and over 11 years, which strengthens the reliability of our findings.",
