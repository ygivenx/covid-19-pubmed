[4] used maximum likelihood methods to fit to the observed incidence time series, but did not attempt to fit to the spatio-temporal pattern of spread. In their later work, the same authors developed a more robust method for estimating species-specific susceptibility and infectiousness parameters and spatial kernel parameters (see Supplementary Information to [3]), but at the time the statistical basis for the methods developed was lacking. In retrospect, the methods developed turned out to be closely related to those developed during the SARS epidemic by Wallinga and Teunis [11], although the earlier work incorporated population denominator data to allow for spatial- and species-based heterogeneity in disease transmission. Nevertheless, the methods employed had the limitation of not being fully parametric, meaning they could not be extended to fit arbitrary transmission models to the observed data. Keeling et al. [5] used maximum likelihood methods to estimate transmission parameters, but it was also supplemented by more ad hoc least-squares matching to regional incidence time series.",

The susceptibility is a relative measure of animal sensitivity to the disease whereas infectivity represents the infectious risk posed by an animal to others. We use a continuous kernel to describe how the probability of contact between farms scaled with distance. Transmission is naturally assumed to decrease with the distance between farms according to the power law(1)where dij represents the Euclidian distance between the infected farm i and the susceptible farm j. The parameters a (kernel offset) and \u03b3 (kernel power) are to be estimated. The kernel captures all forms of movement and contact between farms and as such, the use of a simple 2 parameter function is inevitably a highly simplified representation of the true complexity of inter-farm contacts.

We fitted four separate time-varying model variants: (i) varying the cattle infectivity by a factor and keeping sheep infectivity constant through time (Cattle Infectivity model); (ii) varying sheep infectivity by a factor but not cattle infectivity (Sheep Infectivity model); (iii) varying both cattle and sheep infectivity by the same ratio (Cattle & Sheep Infectivity model); (iv) varying the kernel parameters (Time Varying Kernel model). For the last model variant we also fitted a version which includes non-assortative mixing between species (see equation (8)). Hence the most general mathematical expression of the transmission model is:(9)where(10)The scripts pre and post are self-explanatory for time varying parameters. When fitting models with time varying infectivity parameters we actually fit Ipost and the ratio \u03bc = Ipre/Ipost we called infectivity factor.

For instance, the expected number of CPs culled at the time  which are predicted to have been infected can be formally written as(14)This is a simplification, as in reality the delay from infection to report almost certainly depends on the size and species mix on a farm, but the result is nevertheless indicative of the expected level of infection in proactive culling. Also, at this stage, the calculations are made as if culling was a non-informative censoring process. This is a reasonable assumption for all proactively culled farms except for DCs (which by definition had been identified by veterinarian as having had a high risk of exposure) but our method may underestimate the infection rate. In calculating the infection to report delay distributions, we divided the epidemic after 23rd February into 3 time periods: 23rd February\u201331st March, 31st March\u20131st May and 1st May\u20135th October. In these intervals a total of 1332, 4498 and 1627 farms were slaughtered, respectively. Our best fit model conditioned on 23rd February predicts different infectivity regimes before and after 31st March (see Parameter Estimates and Table 2) but we split further the second period of time due to different delays in reporting to culling.

There are only 4 big farms with 1110, 1400, 2000 and 4500 pigs from which only the last two farms are exclusively pig farms. We denote by  the number of pigs in farm i, pigs susceptibility and pigs infectivity respectively. The simplest model similar to (1.2) conditioned on the first infection has been fitted, reducing the number of parameters in the same manner.(15)In addition we estimated pig\u2236sheep susceptibility ratio and pig infectivity, assuming all parameters constant through time. We found that cattle\u2236sheep susceptibility ratio is 6.8 (sd 0.44), 95% CI (5.99, 7.72). Cattle and sheep infectivity estimates are 8.44 (sd 0.1) 95%CI (6.68, 10.6) and 1.38 (sd 0.18) 95% CI (1.08, 1.77) respectively (the last two are scaled by a factor of 108).

We learned from this model that pigs are less susceptible than sheep, i.e. pigs\u2236sheep susceptibility ratio is estimated at 0.27 (sd 0.09) 95%CI (0.14, 0.48). Also, cattle are more infective than pigs by a factor of 1.89 (sd 0.49) 95%CI (1.18, 3.07), but pigs are more infective than sheep by a factor of 3.43 (sd 0.85) 95%CI (1.95, 5.27). A quick comparison with Table 1 shows parameter estimates for cattle and sheep are largely unaffected by ignoring the pig population, with none of the estimates from the two analyses being significantly different. We conclude that including pigs would not change the conclusions presented in Table 1 regarding cattle and sheep (given the very small number of IPs which had pigs) but it would decrease the power of the analysis and increase model complexity.",

Qualitatively, the results agree with those obtained by Keeling et al. [5] in identifying cattle as being the key species in the 2001 epidemic. Using the interaction model conditioned on 23rd February with time varying cattle infectivity, we estimated that 88% of IPs between 23rd Feb\u201331st March were infected by cattle and only 12% by sheep. Sheep-to-sheep transmission only accounts for 3.1% of IPs in that period. After 31st March (when we estimated that cattle infectivity increased slightly, see Table 2) 91% of the IPs were infected by cattle and 8.9% by sheep, with sheep-to-sheep transmission accounting for only 2.3% of infections. While these levels of transmission from sheep farms are even smaller than previously thought [5], they are consistent with the results of experimental analysis [28] which indicate sheep cannot sustain an epidemic of the Pan O Asian strain of FMD virus.",

Also we shared the concern of earlier work that the distribution of contact distances in traced contacts may well be biased [3]. We therefore estimated the kernel function, using an offset power-law functional form. The higher value of the kernel power parameter we estimated after 23rd February (2.67 vs. 1.70 before \u2013 Figure 3a) is consistent with the expected dramatic shortening in the typical contact distance following the national movement ban. This localized spread together with the higher estimated level of infectivity in cattle after 31st March explains the long tail of the epidemic seen in 2001.",

[5] reduced farm-level sheep population numbers by 30% in Wales and obtained a better geographic match to the data (Matt Keeling, personal communication). However, the discrepancy may also reflect model inadequacy. We have not here allowed for other farm-level risk factors, such as the farm fragmentation index considered by Ferguson et al. [3]. We have not explored more complex non-linear models of the dependence of susceptibility and infectiousness on the number of animals on a farm or relaxed our implicit assumption that contact rates between farms scale linearly with the local density of farms.

It should be noted though that these infection prevalence estimates are in part a result of the relatively non-local kernel estimated simultaneously. If kernel estimates change in a refined analysis \u2013 and if DCs were attributed a much higher risk of infection than estimated here due to their status \u2013 then it is possible that estimated infection rates in DCs and other proactively culled farms may increase somewhat.",
