            "text": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can invade and colonize almost any nucleated cell, resulting in life-long chronic infections that currently affect more than 30% of the world\u2019s population (Manger, Hehl & Boothroyd, 1998; Montoya & Liesenfeld, 2004). Toxoplasmosis infections in immunocompetent individuals are usually self-limiting and are quickly resolved by immune system, thus preventing acute infection. However, T. gondii can cause severe neurological birth defects when transmitted congenitally during a primary infection, with a devastating life-long impact on child health, development, and later productivity (Holliman, 1995). The parasite is also an opportunistic pathogen affecting immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients, by causing the reactivation of latent infection into fulminant disease, usually manifested as toxoplasmic encephalitis and chorioretinitis (Israelski et al., 1993; Luft et al., 1993; Holliman, 1995; Hunter & Sibley, 2012; McLeod et al., 2012).",

Such drugs are also teratogenic and therefore cannot be used during the first trimester of pregnancy (Goldstein, Montoya & Remington, 2008). These factors combined with the emergence of drug-resistant T. gondii strains (Sims, 2009) have created a pressing need for novel antiparasitic therapies. Passive immunization is a useful alternative strategy particularly for diseases characterized by chronic, life-long infections. Vaccination strategies have enjoyed little success because the parasites can evade the immune system, and the major challenge has been to establish sterile immunity, which is an elusive vaccination endpoint (Lim & Othman, 2014). Although preventive vaccines are desirable, most lethal cases of toxoplasmosis are reactivated infections in immunocompromised patients with insufficient cellular immunity (Luft & Remington, 1992). Recombinant antibodies are suitable in this context for passive immunization to inhibit pathogenesis, either as a replacement or adjunct for conventional interventions. Neutralizing antibodies against T. gondii have already demonstrated the feasibility of this strategy (Cha et al., 2001; Fu et al., 2011).",

Plants also achieve the efficient assembly of complex multimeric antibodies closely resembling those produced in mammalian systems, but there is no risk of exposure to animal-derived products and pathogens. Recombinant antibodies derived from murine sources can induce an undesirable human anti-mouse antibody response. Strategies to overcome this issue include antibody humanization (Mateo et al., 1997), phage-display chain shuffling (Kupper et al., 2005), chimeric antibody construction or complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting (Vaquero et al., 1999).",

Combinations of pTRAkc-HC and pTRAkc-LC transformants were mixed at a 1:1 ratio prior to infiltration. The suspensions of the five HC + LC combinations (corresponding to the five scFv variants) were co-agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves by standard syringe infiltration (D\u2019Aoust et al., 2009) and plants were incubated in phytotrons for 5 days before harvesting.",

We therefore converted the scFv antibody into a full-length IgG, which was produced by transient expression in N. benthamiana plants. We also attempted in vitro affinity maturation by VL-CDR3 site-directed mutagenesis, but the detailed functional analysis of the mutant variants demonstrated that no significant improvement was achieved over the performance of the parental antibody using this approach. All mutants were able to bind specifically to T. gondii tachyocytes with no cross-reactivity to human cells or murine ascites. Two variants (RT51 and LT3) showed similar efficacy in parasite invasion assays compared to the parental IgG TG130, but the in vitro performance of variant RA15 was poor. The lack of antibody improvement achieved through the affinity maturation strategy could be due to the inherent limitation of low signal-to-noise ratios as equilibrium selection methods require antigen levels in the range of the antibody KD. The use of tachyzoite cells as native antigens was also likely to contribute to the high noise in the selection phase owing to the complex cell surface landscape. Similar work in the future to improve antibody affinity should consider the use of more nonstochastic methodology such as look-through mutagenesis which systematically generates single amino acid substitutions at each CDR positions; and computational design to predict binding affinity by calculation of binding free-energy of antibody models before generating the antibody mutants. These methods, combined with the use of competitive binding strategy in the selection phase could enable the enrichment for clones with slower-disassociation kinetics than the parent antibody and result in improved affinity.",

However, we found that multiple rounds of biopanning on T. gondii cells resulted in the recovery of predominantly truncated proteins instead of full-length scFvs, as previously reported for other antigens (Yan, Ko & Qi, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Mart\u00ednez-Torrecuadrada et al., 2005) including the selection of Fab antibody fragments against the T. gondii protein SAG1 (Fu et al., 2011). Whole-cell biopanning can be challenging because heterogeneous and sticky cell surfaces tend to trap nonspecific binders, a problem compounded by the propagation of these nonspecific binders in subsequent amplification rounds (Kramer et al., 2003). However, this is offset by the advantage of screening native antigen conformations including carbohydrate epitopes in the context of complex cell-surface landscape (Siegel, 2001). Therefore, we used a single round of selection on tachyzoites resulting in the recovery of functional full-length scFv antibodies, as previously used to isolate functional antibodies against botulinum toxin (Chahboun et al., 2011).",

We therefore carried out extensive bioinformatics analysis on the putative T. gondii-binding scFv sequences to rule out false positives and immature antibodies similar to germline antibody sequences (Vodnik et al., 2011). The antibody sequences were screened against the SAROTUP and MimoDB databases to exclude clones with TUP motifs and identical peptides selected on different targets, which would indicate nonspecific binding. We found that scFv TG130 and its affinity-matured counterparts lacked known TUP motifs and contained no identical peptide hits in the MimoDB database, making them the most likely candidates to show specific high-affinity binding to T. gondii and low cross reactivity. The molecular structure of TG130 revealed more changes of amino acid residue in the CDRs than the framework regions (14.3% and 5.1%, respectively). This is in close agreement with observed somatic hypermutation trends during the humoral response, whereby average mutational probabilities for antigen-combining site and core residues are \u223c12% and \u223c4%, respectively (Clark et al., 2006). Somatic mutations in the variable regions provide increased ligand diversity and are also an established hallmark of in vivo affinity maturation resulting from antigen exposure (Tonegawa, 1983; French, Laskov & Scharff, 1989). As such, the significant sequence and structural changes found within scFv TG130 indicate an antigen-driven selective process during antibody maturation from its germline precursors.",

Hotspots are found either in the germline sequences or close to non-germline sequences, but we focused on germline sequences because previous studies have shown they are more suitable for affinity maturation in vitro (Ho et al., 2005). We chose the germline RGYW hotspot sequence within VL CDR1 for a preliminary round of affinity maturation.

However, the characterization of the IgGs showed that the affinity-matured IgGs did not confer greater binding affinity for the parasite antigen compared to the parental IgG. To avoid this issue, incorporation of an ELISA test of mutated scFvs to help inform selection of higher affinity antibodies as candidates for IgG conversion should be considered in similar work. We found that immunoblotting data was not completely commensurate with the strong ELISA signals. Of five recombinant IgG antibodies tested, only two (parental TG130 and RT51) showed clearly positive immunoblot signals, revealing that one or two substitutions in the CDR can result in a conspicuous difference in antibody binding characteristics. This is expected as mutagenesis often occurs on hotspot residues, which serve as a ligand binding site. Immunoblot analysis using fractionated, non-reduced parasite lysate showed that all two positive antibodies bound to antigens of \u223c55 and \u223c60 kDa, suggesting that the same epitope was recognized by the parent antibody and derivatives. The reducing and non-reducing immunoblots (Fig. 5) showed different banding patterns, with the non-reduced blots showing fewer bands compared to the reduced blots\u2014indicative of the parasite\u2019s multimeric proteins with its disulfide bonds intact. As has also been shown in another study, an immunoblot analysis of T. gondii parasite lysate under reduced conditions would tend to result in multiple non-specific bandings, with a more prominent banding of the protein-of-interest (Besteiro et al., 2009). Therefore, it was important to run an immunoblot analysis under both reduced and non-reduced conditions to gain better clarity on the specificity of the antibodies.",

Overall, our results showed that paired amino acid substitutions within the VL CDR1 had a significant impact on ELISA and immunoblot performance but these changes were better tolerated in IFA experiments. Sequence bias in the affinity-matured antibody library can have this effect but is unlikely in our case because an evaluation of sequence diversity showed a near-even sequence distribution at the target loci (Table S4). However, it is possible that above an affinity threshold, other factors can affect the formation of an antibody-antigen complex, as documented for several cancer-targeting antibodies (Nielsen et al., 2000). This is supported by the lack of correlation between antibody affinity, specificity, and functionality (Nap et al., 1992), with instances where lower-affinity antibodies have shown better targeting and retention properties (Nielsen et al., 2000; Rudnick et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011; Bien-Ly et al., 2014). These findings confirm that the functionality of antibodies is influenced by many different factors, and we are currently investigating the context of such interactions by identifying the parasitic epitopes involved.",

            "text": "We also found that treating tachyzoites with the plant-derived IgGs inhibited the invasion of host cells by up to 75%. Murine polyclonal antibodies against T. gondii surface antigens P30 and AMA1 were previously shown to inhibit invasion by 87% and 40%, respectively (Mineo et al., 1993; Hehl et al., 2000), whereas a murine monoclonal IgG raised against a P. falciparum erythrocyte-invasion antigen achieved a 38% inhibition of invasion (Triglia et al., 2011). The monoclonal IgGs in this study therefore achieved a potent inhibition of invasion comparable to the levels afforded by polyclonal antisera. More remarkably, our experiments showed that the plant-derived chimeric IgGs also inhibited plaque formation by T. gondii on HFF monolayers by 87% (TG130 and RT51) even at a low antibody dose of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml. The individual attachment data sets showed substantial variability between the experiments but all IgG variants except RA15 demonstrated positive blocking activity. We therefore conclude that defective parasite attachment to host cells may not be the main inhibitory mechanism but it plays a substantial contributory role. Based on these encouraging findings, we are currently investigating the in vivo efficacy of our antibodies during toxoplasmosis infections. Taken together, our results demonstrate that plant-derived monoclonal antibodies can substantially inhibit the in vitro activity of T. gondii and, if these results can be confirmed in vivo, the antibodies could be developed into a therapeutic option for immunocompromised patients suffering from toxoplasmosis.",

            "text": "Antibody-based pharmaceuticals are one of the fastest-growing market segments in the biopharmaceutical industry, but the deployment of antibodies against infectious diseases is restricted by high production costs. Plants can address this issue by reducing the cost of antibody production by up to 90% compared to fermenter-based manufacturing (Daniell, Streatfield & Wycoff, 2001; Beasley, 2014), as well as offering further advantages in terms of safety and scalability (Stoger et al., 2005). We chose N. benthamiana as the production platform for our antibodies because the tobacco family is well-established as a host for recombinant protein expression and is recognized by the regulatory bodies governing the production of biopharmaceuticals (Schillberg, Fischer & Emans, 2003; Stoger et al., 2005). Tobacco plants can produce high antibody yields, including a tumor-specific full-length human IgG at 500 mg/kg fresh biomass (Giritch et al., 2006; Frenzel, Hust & Schirrmann, 2013) and up to 600 mg/kg for a scFv (Rosenberg et al., 2013). Our yields of 33\u201372 mg/kg fresh biomass are satisfactory for a preliminary proof-of-concept study with no optimization and could be improved by co-expression with protease inhibitors or the viral p19 protein to prevent gene silencing.",

We also demonstrate that the chimeric IgG derivatives of the scFv antibody fragment can be expressed in and purified from N. benthamiana plants and retain their functionality and specificity against T. gondii, making them suitable candidates for the treatment of vulnerable patient groups suffering from toxoplasmosis.",
