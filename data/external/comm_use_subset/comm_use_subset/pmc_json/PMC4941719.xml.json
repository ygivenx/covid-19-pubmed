Mont et al.1 studied 101 MFON cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1996 from 21 centers in the United States. According to the available data from 12 centers concerning their total number of patients with osteonecrosis, 81 patients had MFON of the 2484 patients (3.3%) diagnosed with osteonecrosis. In 2003, we screened post-SARS medical workers with corticosteroid use and found 37 patients had MFON of the 176 patients (21%) with a diagnosis of osteonecrosis. By contrast, between 2005 and 2009, we found only 17 patients with MFON of the 657 patients (2.6%) diagnosed with osteonecrosis who were admitted to our center. The incidence of MFON in post-SARS osteonecrosis patients was obviously higher than that in daily clinical practice. This is because the lesions found in joints, such as the knees, shoulders and ankles, in the early stages of MFON cases may not have any signs or symptoms. In our screening of post-SARS patients, all of them had a comprehensive MRI evaluation of their bilateral hips, knees, shoulders and wrists or ankles, which revealed the asymptomatic osteonecrosis. However, in daily clinical practice, we often focus on the osteonecrosis diagnosis of the femoral head without performing an MRI on the other joints. This implies that there are possible missed diagnoses of asymptomatic MFON patients. A recent study also showed a higher incidence of MFON than that typically reported in literature4.",

In the cases reported by Mont et al.1, 91% had a history of corticosteroid use, and the rest had a coagulation disorder. Our study showed that 94 of the 96 (98%) MFON patients admitted to our center had a treatment history of high-dose corticosteroids, and the two remaining patients had a history of alcohol use. Moreover, the dosage and route of administration of the corticosteroids were obviously related to the incidence of MFON. A study by Hernigou4 demonstrated that the total dose and the daily dose of venous injection were closely related to the occurrence of MFON.

MFON is recognized as a complication in the maintenance treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin\u2019s disease, and its incidence in these diseases is also higher than that reported in the literature. Solarino et al.9 performed MRI screening in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia after chemotherapy and found that 82% of them had MFON9. In the MFON cases presented in this study, most were SLE, followed by hematological diseases, nephropathy, organ transplantation, dermatomyositis and multiple sclerosis. MFON was especially prevalent in leukemia patients; 17 of the 20 osteonecrosis patients with leukemia under our care were found to have MFON. Three of the four patients who received pulse steroid therapy for trauma emergency had a spinal cord injury, for which steroid therapy was considered appropriate. However, one patient received pulse steroid therapy for only an eye injury and was found to have osteonecrosis in eight joints, including the hips, knees, shoulders and ankles. Caution should be taken for such cases in the future.",

Plain film X-ray is not sensitive enough to diagnose asymptomatic MFON, but there is still an advantage to carrying out an X-ray examination. Even if the X-ray result of a joint with pain is negative for osteonecrosis, it provides a preliminary examination of the local bone structure, which serves as a reference for further investigation by MRI. Other methods include a short time inversion recovery (STIR) MRI test followed by MRI or a radionuclide scan of specific joints. Nevertheless, further studies are required to determine the optimal method for early detection of osteonecrosis. Moreover, as the majority (70\u2013100%) of osteonecrosis cases reported in the literature are bilateral, patients diagnosed with osteonecrosis of a joint on one side should be radiologically examined on the other side.",

            "text": "The treatment of MFON remains controversial. The general principle is to estimate the prognosis of each lesion. In addition, predicting the presence of collapse of the joint surfaces is the basis for determining the order of treatment. The progress of osteonecrosis is often different for each joint. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head progresses the fastest and attention should be paid to the early appearance of symptoms. This is followed by the progression of osteonecrosis to the knees and shoulders. Patients who have osteonecrosis of multiple weight-bearing joints and a large necrotic lesion area may develop joint destruction, and early intervention should be used. The progression of osteonecrosis to the elbow and wrist is relatively slow; however, we still lack experience regarding the appropriate treatment method for this area. Bone infarction often leads to calcification and self-repair. Hence, osteonecrotic elbows and wrists should mainly be managed by monitoring, and over treatment should be avoided if there are no clinical symptoms. In addition, an appropriate treatment strategy should be selected according to the stage of osteonecrosis in each joint involved20. For symptomatic patients at an early stage (i.e., ARCO Stages I, II or China Stages I\u2013III), joint-preservation treatment options are commonly used, such as extracorporeal shock wave, core decompression, and vascularized and nonvascularized bone grafting. When >2 mm of the articular surface has collapsed or the necrotic lesion area is >50%, joint-preservation treatments may not provide good efficacy. In the advanced stages of the disease (i.e., ARCO Stages IIIc and IV, or China Stages V\u2013VI), arthroplasty is required when joint preservation is not possible.",

            "text": "Our general survey on the bones and joints of post-SARS medical workers who used corticosteroids revealed that the corticosteroid dose was approximately 2000 mg in unifocal osteonecrosis patients. By contrast, the dose was >5000 mg in all MFON patients except for one patient who received 2000 mg, with the highest dose at 31,000 mg. The MFON patients also had prolonged corticosteroid treatment (\u226530 days)3. Of the 17 MFON patients diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2009, one had a 30-year history of alcohol abuse (average daily alcohol consumption of 500 g). The remaining 16 patients had a history of intensive steroid use for the following diseases: SLE (7 patients), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (4 patients), chronic nephropathy (3 patients), anaphylactoid purpura (1 patient) and pulse steroid therapy for traumatic shock (1 patient). Therefore, we summarized the high risk factors for MFON to include: a medical history of SLE, chronic nephropathy, hematological diseases or coagulation abnormalities (especially leukemia); total corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) dose >5000 mg, especially for patients with a history of intravenous pulse therapy; and a total corticosteroid administration time of >30 days.",
