            "text": "Mammalian fertilization is underpinned by a number of sequential interactions between sperm and oocytes that culminate in a complex process of membrane adhesion and fusion [1]. The understanding of the molecular basis of gamete interactions has been advanced by an elegant series of transgenic and biochemical studies focusing on the sperm protein IZUMO1, and its oolemmal binding partner, IZUMO1R (sperm-egg fusion protein Juno) [2]. IZUMO1 is a type 1 transmembrane protein [3] that localizes to both the inner and outer acrosomal membranes of spermatozoa before undergoing dynamic relocalization to the cell surface upon completion of an acrosome reaction [4]. From this latter position, IZUMO1 directs gamete recognition and adhesion via multiple low-affinity interactions with IZUMO1R, a GPI-linked receptor that resides on the surface of the oolemma [5]. The indispensable nature of this interaction has been confirmed through complementary in vitro antibody inhibition and in vivo knockout studies targeting Izumo1 and Izumo1r, all of which effectively block the fertilization cascade at the level of gamete adhesion/fusion [2]. Bianchi and colleagues [6] have, however, shown that the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not directly promote membrane fusion. Indeed, while the ectopic expression of IZUMO1R in HEK293 cells is successful in promoting their adhesion, it fails to induce the formation of syncytia among these cells [6, 7]. Similarly, cultured cells expressing mouse IZUMO1 can bind to oocytes, but fail to fuse with them [8\u201310]. Such findings are seemingly at odds with the demonstration that sperm from Izumo1 null males are capable of binding to but not fusing with the oolemma [3].",

            "text": "These apparently contradictory results may be reconciled by the existence of alternative IZUMO1 receptor(s) that mediate gamete membrane fusion [7] or by the propensity of IZUMO1 to associate with other, as yet unidentified sperm surface proteins, leading to the formation of several higher-order multiprotein complexes [11]. Thus, in addition to its direct binding to IZUMO1R, it has been suggested that IZUMO1 may play a secondary role in gamete fusion by virtue of its ability to organize and/or stabilize fusogenic proteins within the sperm membrane [12]. Alternatively, and as explored herein, IZUMO1 may be associated with other key regulators of sperm receptor organization and fusion. Such models of gamete fusion share analogy with the mechanisms that underpin membrane fusion in many other biological systems where the concerted action of multiprotein complexes is a well-established paradigm. For instance, it is widely accepted that a majority of enveloped viruses use protein complexes to regulate their progression through the sequential phases of fusion with a suitable target cell membrane, i.e., receptor recognition, triggering of fusion, and fusion execution [13, 14]. The complexity of this membrane fusion machinery ranges from the use of multiple copies of a single glycoprotein for the entire fusion reaction [15], through to the segregation of the activities responsible for membrane attachment and membrane fusion into different proteins and separate multimeric complexes [16].",

It is proposed that the N-terminal IZUMO domain participates in formation of smaller complexes, whereas the transmembrane domain and/or the cytoplasmic tail direct the formation of larger complexes. The existence of unique pools of IZUMO1 complexes is further supported by the demonstration that different IZUMO1 antibodies localize the protein either exclusively within the equatorial segment [17] or, alternatively, on the entire/anterior acrosomal region of acrosome-reacted sperm [3, 11]. While the identity of the putative IZUMO1-interacting proteins has yet to be established, the use of genomic and proteomic techniques has uncovered several candidate molecules with putative roles in sperm-oocyte interaction [18], including various members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain) [19] and CAP (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins) superfamily of enzymes [20].",

To validate these findings, IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 antibodies were used to probe extracts of mouse spermatozoa under reducing and native conditions. Consistent with our previous work [21], under reducing conditions, the GLIPR1L1 antibody bound to a predominant band with a molecular weight of 37 kDa, while the IZUMO1 antibody bound to a protein with a mass of ~ 56 kDa (Fig. 1b). Further, immunoblot analysis of native sperm lysates with these antibodies revealed strong binding with several very high molecular weight protein bands, raising the possibility that both IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 associate with additional sperm proteins to form multimeric complexes (Fig. 1c). Specifically, probing with IZUMO1 antibodies labeled at least six protein bands of ~ 150\u2013750 kDa, supporting previous work that IZUMO1 associates with other proteins to form multimeric complexes on the surface of mouse spermatozoa [11]. GLIPR1L1 was detected in association with six predominant complexes of ~ 200\u20131000 kDa. The number of complexes recognized by both antibodies did not appear to change between non-capacitated, capacitated, or capacitated and A23187-treated sperm, although quantitative changes were observed wherein there appeared to be some loss of each complex in the latter sample. Importantly, both IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 were localized with a band consistent with oolemmal protein-binding complex I (~ 750 kDa). They also colocalized to complex IV (Fig. 1a, c, complexes I and IV, marked in red arrowheads).

Rather, a relatively large number of discrete foci of colocalization were observed, few of which were present in the developing acrosomal domain. Unexpectedly, PLA staining for the complex was virtually absent in epididymal spermatozoa before re-emerging within the head of > 90% of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa (Fig. 5b, c). Importantly, a suite of controls utilizing antibodies against proteins that should not interact with IZUMO1, such as acrosin and \u03b1-tubulin, as well as single antibody only controls, failed to demonstrate the presence of any fluorescent signals (Additional file 1: Figure S1) indicating that the interaction observed between IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 was specific.

Consistent with the hypothesis, both proteins displayed strong colocalization with GM1 gangliosides in the peri-acrosomal region of the head of capacitated spermatozoa (Fig. 6). Consistent with previous data, upon the induction of acrosomal exocytosis, GM1 became more widely distributed throughout the anterior region of the sperm head (Fig. 6).

Similarly, no significant differences were seen in the number of pups per litter, body weight, testis weight, or daily sperm production between genotypes (Additional file 3: Figure S3A-C, Fig. 8b). Sperm motility was assessed using a computer-assisted sperm analyzer, revealing no significant differences in total or progressive motility and other sperm velocity parameters between genotypes (Fig. 8c\u2013e). Similarly, sperm appeared to capacitate normally as assessed by the time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation in capacitation permissive media (Fig. 8f, Additional file 4: Figure S4). By contrast, sperm from Glipr1l1\u2212/\u2212 mice had a significantly reduced ability to undergo the progesterone-induced acrosome reaction compared to wild type (54% in WT, 17% in knockout sperm, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 8g).

            "text": "In previous studies, we have isolated biologically active, native protein complexes from mouse and human spermatozoa and demonstrated that several of these multimeric entities possess affinity for homologous zona pellucidae [25, 26]. Herein, we have extended the analysis to focus on complexes that are present in acrosome-reacted mouse spermatozoa, which may participate in downstream interactions with the oolemma. These studies revealed that sperm do indeed possess multimeric protein complexes with the potential to adhere to solubilized oolemmal proteins. Furthermore, in agreement with independent data [11], we were able to identify the sperm adhesion molecule, IZUMO1, as a key constituent of some, but not all, of these complexes. IZUMO1 has been the subject of intense interest since it was identified as being essential for fertilization [2, 3, 27, 28]. Interestingly, the protein lacks a fusogenic domain and properties commensurate with those expected of a membrane fusion-inducing molecule. Additionally, while the ectopic expression of IZUMO1, or its complementary oolemmal receptor IZUMO1R, in model cell lines is sufficient to support their adhesion, it fails to promote cell fusion [6\u201310]. Taken together, these data raise the prospect that IZUMO1 may either bind other receptor(s) or it may bind to other ancillary proteins with roles involved in oolemma adhesion and fusion. The data presented here indicated that GLIPR1L1 is one such protein and that it is required for optimal fertilization. The latter model is analogous with the concerted action of the multimeric fusogenic complexes that have been implicated in membrane fusion events as diverse as viral envelope and synaptic vesicle fusion [14, 29\u201332].",

            "text": "In regard to potential IZUMO1-interacting proteins in spermatozoa, we identified GLIPR1L1 as a key candidate in at least two high molecular weight complexes. Mouse GLIPR1L1 has a testis-enriched expression profile and undergoes extensive post-translational modifications during spermatogenesis before becoming localized to the post-acrosomal region and connecting piece of elongated spermatids and spermatozoa [21]. GLIPR1L1 is also present on the plasma membrane of at least rat, bovine, and macaque sperm and depending on species, variably anchored by a GPI linkage within lipid rafts within the membrane [24, 33]. In the bovine, GLIPR1L1 surface association appears to result from the uptake of this protein from the microvesicles that spermatozoa encounter during their maturation in the epididymis [34]. By contrast, the mouse GLIPR1L1 orthologue is acquired during spermatogenesis. It does not contain a consensus GPI anchor site and cannot be released from the sperm surface by GPI-specific phospholipase C [21], confirming that the mechanism of GLIPR1L1 association with the sperm surface varies between species. Nevertheless, as an interesting example of evolutionary divergence in the means by which a protein becomes localized to an orthologous domain within sperm, our data suggest that mouse GLIPR1L1 does partition into lipid rafts on the surface of sperm; a finding that is of importance owing to the ability of rafts to serve as platforms for the assembly of multimeric complexes that coordinate a variety of specialized functions, including fertilization [22]. While we have yet to definitively demonstrate that lipid rafts facilitate the formation and/or repositioning of GLIPR1L1-IZUMO1 complexes in mouse spermatozoa, it is noteworthy that IZUMO1 has also been independently identified as a constituent of mouse sperm lipid rafts [17, 35].",

            "text": "GLIPR1L1 is a member of the CAP superfamily which has putative roles in processes as diverse as carcinogenesis, immune tolerance, and potentially cell adhesion [20]. Of note, several additional members of the CAP family play roles in mammalian male fertility, including roles in spermatogenesis, epididymal sperm maturation, and potentially at the site of fertilization [36\u201339]. However, despite previous findings implicating GLIPR1L1 in sperm binding to the zona pellucida in both mouse and bovine models [21, 24], we noted only a relatively modest, non-statistically significant reduction in the ability of Glipr1l1\u2212/\u2212 spermatozoa to participate in this cellular interaction. These data raise the prospect that deficits in sperm-zona pellucida adhesion may, at least in part, be attributed to GLIPR1L1 antibodies eliciting non-specific steric hindrance and/or masking of zona pellucida receptors. While the precise molecular function of GLIPR1L1 therefore remains to be established, data from other CAP proteins supports a putative fusogenic role and indicates that this role is most likely associated with the evolutionarily conserved CAP domain at the N-terminal half of the protein [20, 40]; potentially involving the first 101 amino acids, which have been implicated previously in cell-cell adhesion [41]. Consistent with this hypothesis, the ability of GLIPR1L1 to regulate the acrosome reaction, an event in which the plasma membrane and outer acrosomal membranes fuse, is analogous to the membrane fusion processes required at the time of fertilization. Our data is also consistent with the identification of the sea squirt sperm plasma membrane CAP proteins, HrUrabin and CiUrabin, as sperm receptors for the vitelline coat in two species of these marine invertebrates [42, 43], and with the ability of the mammalian CAPs, CRISP1, CRISP2, and CRISP4, to promote acrosome exocytosis in the mouse. The latter also raises the possibility that CAP domains, from a number of individual proteins, may act redundantly in acrosome function and/or fertilization [36\u201338, 40].",

Specifically, sperm fusion to the oocyte is known to occur at the equatorial segment. By contrast, IZUMO1-GLIPR1L1 complexes are localized within the post-acrosomal region.

Although we have yet to determine how the repositioning of IZUMO1 and GLIPR1L1 is achieved, our data show that the movement of IZUMO1 is dependent on GLIPR1L1 function.

Indeed, Glipr1l1 knockout males sired litters of equivalent size to that of WT control males, indicating that GLIPR1L1 is not essential for male fertility. Such findings mirror those of previous studies in which numerous gene-manipulated mouse models have been shown to retain normal fertility despite the selective ablation of sperm proteins that were originally proposed as essential for fertilization based on in vitro experiments (reviewed in [44, 45]). In seeking to reconcile this apparent dichotomy, it is conceivable that knockout mice experience a genetic compensation response whereby the transcription of gene(s) related to the inactivated target is upregulated [46, 47]. Alternatively, it is possible that spermatozoa harbor multiple intrinsic oocyte receptors that work synergistically and thus impart some level of functional redundancy to key aspects of the fertilization cascade [48]. Thus, while subtle defects in sperm function may result in sub-optimal fertilization rates in an in vitro setting, these do not necessarily directly translate to reduced fertilization in vivo. Alternatively, it is possible that differences exist in the mechanistic basis by which agonists, such as the steroidal hormone progesterone, stimulate acrosomal exocytosis versus that of the physiological stimuli sperm encounter upon interaction with the oocyte vestments [49]. In any case, we noted that ~ 17% of the spermatozoa from Glipr1l1 knockout males retained their ability to undergo an acrosome reaction (compared to 54% WT spermatozoa), thus contributing a sufficient population of fertilization-competent spermatozoa to achieve normal rates of fertilization after natural mating.",

Where indicated, negative control (non-capacitated) incubations were conducted using non-capacitation medium prepared without NaHCO3 but with additional NaCl incorporated to maintain an osmolarity of 300 mOsm/kg. The formation of bicarbonate in these samples was prevented by capping the tubes throughout the incubation at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2: 95% air. Positive control (capacitated) incubations were conducted in media supplemented with 1 mM pentoxifylline (ptx) and 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP).

Briefly, Glipr1l1 was modified at exon 1 (ENSMUSE00000640359) by the guide RNA (gRNA) sequence: forward-TCCTAGGGTGCCAACTATCA and reverse-TGATAGTGCCTAGGCTTTAA, which includes the scaffolding required to form a complex with the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9. The resulting Cas9/gRNA complex bound to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and cleaved the double-stranded DNA three nucleotides upstream of the PAM site leaving blunt ends. This break in the DNA stimulated an imprecise non-homologous end joining repair which resulted in a 7-bp (ACTATCA) deletion in exon 1 of the Glipr1l1 gene. This resulted in a truncated mRNA containing exon 1, which encoded the first 39 N-terminal amino acids of the GLIPR1L1 protein (Additional file 2: Figure S2A-B).

Sperm from cauda epididymis and vas deferens were collected using the backflushing technique. The spermatozoa suspension was equilibrated in vitro for 15 min and loaded into a CASA chamber (80 \u03bcm depth) for analysis.
