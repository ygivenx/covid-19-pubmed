Identification of NTHi as the predominant pathogen further supports our hypothesis that persistent wheezers present an underlying inflammation induced by chronic bacterial infection. Chronic NTHI infection, resulting from the ability of NTHI to persist in the lower airways through several escape mechanisms from the host immune responses, has previously been reported by others [31-33]. Moreover, in the lower airways of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, NTHI has been demonstrated to be a major inflammatory stimulus [31,34].",

In the middle ear, biofilm formation has been demonstrated to be one of the major mechanisms for persistence and provides an explanation for unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy [39,40]. Moreover, biofilm formation and intracellular infection are well established mechanisms of NTHi for persistence in the lower airways [31-33]. Although our study does not provide evidence of biofilm formation in the lower airways of young unresponsive wheezers, our findings of poor response to and frequent relapse after a short course of antibiotic treatment are suggestive for involvement of biofilm. Biofilm formation should be addressed in future studies, because its presence may have consequences for treatment.",

These microbiological findings and the presence of a pronounced neutrophilic inflammation in BAL-fluid, sampled in patients not presenting an acute exacerbation episode, favours the hypothesis that chronic bacterial infection is an ongoing inflammatory stimulus providing a possible explanation for persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy in these young patients. These elements suggest that the use of antibiotic treatment, although not currently recommended, should be considered in selected young children presenting with chronic wheezing. However, as these patients are indistinguishable without the use of invasive procedures, and biofilm formation and other escape mechanisms may decrease the bactericidal efficacy of antibiotic treatment, additional research is necessary before specific treatment recommendations can be provided. Future research should focus on population characteristics, determination of risk factors for acquisition of bacterial bronchial infection, pathogenicity mechanisms of chronic bronchial infection and possible prevention and treatment strategies.",
