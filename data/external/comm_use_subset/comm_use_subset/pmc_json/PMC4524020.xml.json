The sources of serum samples where the virus was identified were from patients infected in 2009 and 2010 in China. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), the disease caused by the virus has a major clinical presentations that include fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurological symptoms, bleeding tendency, as well as less specific clinical manifestations [1, 2]. This disease has a case-fatality rate ranging from 2.5 to 30 % in different areas of endemicity [4]. Human-to-human transmission of SFTSV was reported to occur through close contact with the blood and/or body secretions of infected patients [5\u20139].",

Recently, the existence of this disease has also been confirmed in Japan and South Korea [11\u201315]. In Japan, the case-fatality rate of 55 % (6/11) was apparently higher than that in China, where an average of 12 % of cases was fatal [13]. Data on the high fatality rate due to SFTSV indicate that SFTSV is a threat to human health. Another tick-borne phlebovirus, the Heartland virus, which was detected in Missouri, is phylogenetically associated with SFTSV. It causes severe febrile illness with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia in the total blood cell count, and elevated levels of liver enzymes [16].",

Virus isolation from the blood of viremic patients is the direct evidence of SFTSV infection, however, it is time-consuming and needs high security biocontainment facility [1, 2]. Detection of SFTSV genome could be achieved by different nucleic acid detection techniques such as reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) [1, 2], real-time RT-PCR [14, 17], reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RT-LAMP) [18\u201320], reverse transcription-cross-priming amplification coupled (RT-CPA) with vertical flow (VF) visualization [21]. Although these techniques have high sensitivity and specificity in early diagnosis, the duration of viraemia in SFTSV infection is very short, generally 1\u20136 days after the disease onset [22]. Hence, the nucleic acid detecting techniques are applicable only during the acute phase of the disease which is within 1 week after its onset. The final confirmation of infection in many cases may rely on the detection of the specific antibodies to SFTSV.",

Like other bunyaviruses, the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; the M segment has an open reading frame (ORF) coding for a GnGc precursor in the order Gn-Gc; whereas the S segment uses ambisense coding to express two proteins: one is a nucleocapsid (N) protein encoded by the 5\u2032 half of viral complementary sense S RNA, and the other is a nonstructural (NS) protein encoded by viral sense S RNA [1, 2, 23]. Nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most immunodominant viral proteins among members of the Bunyaviridae family. Recombinant N protein of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus, another member of the Phlebovirus genus, was reported to be used in a detection system for the laboratory diagnosis of RFV infection in humans and animals [24\u201326]. In SFTSV, Jiao et al. developed a recombinant N protein based sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting the total antibodies against this virus in humans and animals [27]. In our present report, recombinant SFTSV-N (rSFTSV-N) protein was expressed by using Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system and then purified. rSFTSV-N protein based IgG ELISA and IgM ELISA systems were established. Serum samples from clinically-suspected SFTS patients were used to evaluate the newly established systems and results were compared with those obtained by using the total antibody detecting sandwich ELISA system.",

The sequence and reading frame of the N gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the recombinant plasmid. The recombinant protein was successfully expressed in E. coli. Most of the expressed protein was soluble (Fig.1b lane 2). The rSFTSV-N protein was purified from the supernatant under native conditions. Analysis of purified recombinant protein by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining revealed a single protein band of 26kD as predicted by the amino acid sequence of the nucleocapsid protein (Fig. 1b lane 4).

It is well known that the IgG competes with the IgM in binding to antigen thereby reducing the sensitivity of indirect IgM ELISA [30].

Our SFTSV-N protein based systems detect IgG and IgM separately, so it can distinguish previous or recent infection, respectively.
