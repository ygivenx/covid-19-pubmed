            "text": "Respiratory virus infections are among the most common diseases in humans and cause significant morbidity and mortality across seasons and populations (1). While respiratory virus infections can often be mild, these infections are typically undocumented, as individuals may not seek medical care because either the infection is asymptomatic or it elicits symptoms not severe enough to warrant seeking care. As a consequence, standard medical surveillance provides an incomplete picture of the epidemiology of respiratory infections. In this study, which was an extension of a previously published study focusing on infection in this population during only the summer months (2), we focused on ascertaining the rates of asymptomatic infection for the following suite of respiratory viruses: adenovirus, coronavirus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza virus (PIV). The population in this study was not only largely asymptomatic but also specifically ambulatory; we recruited participants from among visitors to a New York City tourist attraction. We therefore might have missed sampling severely symptomatic patients who were not well enough to visit the attraction, but we nonetheless can estimate the levels of prevalence in a setting where transmission is likely.",

A study carried out in Nashville, TN, and Salt Lake City, UT, recruited 238 completely asymptomatic adults (no symptoms within 14 days of recruitment), who were controls for patients with pneumonia, from among visitors to outpatient primary care clinics for routine health checks. Of these individuals, only 5 (2%) tested positive for human rhinovirus (HRV), coronavirus (CoV), or human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (3). A different study, also based in Salt Lake City, UT, which prospectively recorded infection and symptoms over time within families recruited from the University of Utah campus community, found that 47% of respiratory infections among adults were asymptomatic. Influenza A virus, hMPV, CoV HKU1, and CoV OC43 were more frequently associated with symptoms (4). Among elderly adults enrolled in prospective surveillance in Rochester, NY, two studies have shown that very high proportions (80% to 90%) were symptomatic when infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, and hMPV (5, 6).",

In one study, 52% of asymptomatic children recruited from an Alaskan community tested positive for shedding respiratory virus in a one-time sampling scheme, with the majority having HRV and adenovirus (7). In another prospective surveillance investigation comparing positivity levels of symptomatic and asymptomatic infants in Perth, Australia, respiratory viruses were detected in 70% of samples from symptomatic infants and in 24.6% of samples from asymptomatic infants (8). In general, among children, studies have found that 24.6% to 64% of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections are asymptomatic (7\u201310). A number of studies have also documented the fraction of asymptomatic children who are shedding virus rather than the fraction of infected children who are asymptomatic. Calvo et al. documented an HRV shedding rate of 12.3% among healthy children (9). Van Benten et al. found that 20% of asymptomatic infants \u22642 years old tested positive for HRV (11). Similarly, Nokso-Koivisto et al. found that 20% of children without any past or recent respiratory infection symptoms tested positive for HRV or coronavirus (CoV) (12). Other studies examining multiple respiratory agents documented respiratory virus infection in 40% and 42% of children without symptoms (13, 14). The definition of symptomatic infection is not standardized, but most of these studies defined asymptomatic patients as those free from symptoms at the time of study participation or within a window around the time of enrollment.",

            "text": "This wide variation in symptomatic versus asymptomatic presentations underscores the need for further studies to understand the distribution of symptoms across infection statuses. Here, we document the shedding prevalence of a number of common respiratory viruses in an ambulatory adult population, as well as the distributions of symptomatology and symptom severity. Sampling was conducted in two seasonal arms: one carried out in the late spring/early summer (summer arm), which has been previously reported (2), and one carried out in the late winter/early spring (winter arm). In the summer arm, we found that over 5% of individuals tested positive for respiratory virus, with the majority testing positive for HRV, but with over half also reporting being asymptomatic. We hypothesized that these numbers might vary by season, as many respiratory infections, as well as ambulatory population contact dynamics, display seasonal patterns. (Since we published our previous study, GenMark Diagnostics, the manufacturer of the respiratory viral panel [RVP] assay used to analyze these samples, determined that a higher cutoff value for positivity was warranted for some of the assayed viruses. This paper thus rereports the summer study with a cutoff value of 25 nA/mm2 rather than 3 nA/mm2, so the numbers differ from those reported in Shaman et al. [2].)",

Some of the best-fit models also included the age category, although the only statistically significant result was that individuals aged 30 to 39 years were more likely to be positive than individuals aged 18 to 29 years. This association might be due to the fact that 30-to-39-year-old adults may be more likely to have or to be in contact with young children, who classically have a high prevalence of respiratory virus infection and frequently transmit infection to their parents (M.

While the sampling scheme was designed to capture individuals from a population different from those represented in studies of persons seeking medical attention, it would not capture individuals who stay home with severe symptoms. However, given that the site used in the study is frequented by tourists, who usually only have a limited amount of time in New York City, we hypothesize that many people might still visit the site despite having symptoms that would otherwise keep them home. Consequently, our sample may be less skewed in symptom distribution than a random sample from the street. Conversely, among tourist attraction visitors, those with symptoms might have been more inclined to participate in this study. Symptoms were self-reported, which can introduce error, and were reported only for the previous 48 h. For some viruses, RNA can be detected for several weeks following infection, so some seemingly asymptomatic individuals who tested positive may have been previously infected and symptomatic. Further, shedding prior to symptom development also occurs (19). These dynamics preclude calculation of the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic, but not estimation of asymptomatic prevalence in the ambulatory population, as the participants were asymptomatic at the time and were still shedding. Also, the study was run over two seasons, but there were no samples taken during the late summer or fall or early winter season, when prevalence levels may be different. For the diagnostic analysis, we performed a molecular test but did not try to isolate viruses or determine titers and therefore cannot confirm whether the virus collected in samples was viable. Lastly, this study excluded children, who have a high burden of respiratory virus infection.",

            "text": "We conducted a range of statistical tests to identify associations between various demographic factors and both symptom scores and viral positivity. For categorical variables, such as gender and age group, we used ANOVA and Tukey tests to determine whether there were statistical differences in the average symptom scores between categories of the variable. We used chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact tests to compare differences across each categorical variable with respect to positivity. We performed univariate and multivariate regression to test associations between each set of variables (race, gender, age group, allergies, travel, residence, and Hispanic self-identification) and quantitated positivity scores (measured in nanoangstroms per square millimeter) for all viruses and for HRV and CoV separately. Logistic regression was used to conduct a similar analysis on associations between the demographic variables and positivity as a binary variable (positive versus negative) for all viruses and for HRV and CoV separately. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to identify the best-fitting models.",
