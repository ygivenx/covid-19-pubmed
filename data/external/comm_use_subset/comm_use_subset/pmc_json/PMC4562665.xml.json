The vaccine could provide protective immunity against the classic CPV-2 infection in canine populations, reducing the mortality of animals and spreading of the virus. However, the long-term interaction of the virus and its host may have led to the emergence of CPV-2 antigenic variants. During the past decades, new antigenic types of the CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, new CPV-2a, and new CPV-2b were frequently reported in the dog population, and they replaced the original CPV-2, which has caused widespread concern [2\u20139]. Therefore, molecular epidemiological investigation of CPV-2 is an undergoing hotspot issue worldwide.",

At present, VP2 is widely used for the identification and monitoring of the types of CPV-2 circulating in the canine population based on the amino acid residues of the VP2 protein at positions 426Asp/Glu/Asn and 297Ser/Ala [10, 12\u201315]. In the current study, the molecular epidemiology of the CPV-2 strains circulating in northeast China was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the partial VP2 gene. Moreover, potential recombination events of the identified CPV-2 strains were analyzed using the selected entire VP2 gene. Our aim was to provide insights into the epidemiology and genetic diversity of the CPV-2 strains circulating in northeast China, which can be useful for preventing and controlling CPV-2 infections.",

This study indicated that the new CPV-2a (Ser297Ala) variant, accounting for 64.21% of CPV-2 infections, was the predominating strain circulating in the three districts of Heilongjiang province in northeast China. The new CPV-2b (Ser297Ala) variant, accounting for 21.05% of CPV-2 infections, was the second most predominant strain circulating in the Harbin and Daqing districts of Heilongjiang province. In our study, the prevalence of the new CPV-2a is in agreement with most of the reports that were recently conducted in China [8, 15, 30, 34, 35], African countries [36], other Asian countries, including Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Turkey, and Australia [6, 37\u201339]. However, the prevalence of the new CPV-2b variant reported here in CPV-2-positive samples was higher than those in other reports in China. Interestingly, the presence of the rare CPV-2c, accounting for 14.74% of the CPV-2-positive samples, was confirmed in the Harbin and Mudanjiang of Heilongjiang province. The co-circulation of the CPV-2c, new CPV-2a, and new CPV-2b has previously not been reported in China. It has been reported that the CPV-2c variant is widely distributed and co-exists with other CPV types in Europe and North and South America [40\u201345]. Compared with an earlier report that detected the CPV-2, new CPV-2a, and CPV-2b variants in China [46], the emergence of the CPV-2c in northeast China suggests that CPV-2 strains circulating in China exhibit genetic variations. Additionally, our results are similar to those reported for the genotypes of CPV-2 strains circulating in India, where the new CPV-2a and new CPV-2b were the predominant strains [14], and the co-circulation of the CPV-2c was also found [47].",

Presumably, this mutation may result in stronger receptor binding. In our study, all 95 identified CPV-2 strains, including the new2a, new2b, and 2c types, contained the unique Tyr324Ile mutation. The Tyr324Ile mutation in CPV-2a strains has been reported in China [8, 15, 30, 46], South Korea [38], Thailand [48], Uruguay [49], Japan [50], Taiwan [6], and India [51]. These data support the view that the Try324Ile substitution in CPV-2 strains may be a common amino acid alteration in Asia countries, especially in China. This conclusion needs to be validated by an extensive epidemiological survey in a future study. In addition, further studies should be conducted to understand the relationship between the Try324Ile substitution and the severity of clinical symptoms.",

These data demonstrated that type new2b and 2c strains of CPV-2 circulating in northeast China exhibited genetic stability. However, compared with CPV-2 reference strains, the type new2b strains showed a unique Thr440Ala substitution (100%), and the type 2c strains exhibited a unique Gln370Arg substitution (100%). The amino acid substitutions resulted in phylogenetic changes in the new2b and 2c strains identified in our study. The new2b and 2c strains (except one strain) differed genetically from the reference strains of other countries, forming one group (GI) with Chinese reference strains of the new2b and 2c types. In our study, the close relationship between the new 2b and 2c types suggests that these two types share a similar evolutionary history in China. For the identified type 2c strains, the unique Gln370Arg substitution, which was previously not described, was highlighted as evidence of a potential CPV-2c variant or new CPV-2c. Further studies regarding potential variant CPV-2c strains should be conducted to understand the relationship between the Gln370Arg substitution and viral pathogenicity.",

Of the 61 new2a strains, a total of two amino acid substitution sites were revealed, Asn419Ser and Thr440Ala. The two amino acid substitutions, as well as some non-synonymous substitutions, accounted for the genetic diversity of the new2a strains in the phylogenetic tree. In our study, the Asn419Ser substitution was detected in only three of the 61 new2a strains. We suggest that the Asn419Ser substitution, first described here, should be the focus of further epidemiological investigations of CPV-2. Accumulating reports have indicated that the new CPV-2a strains, accounting for high positive rates among CPV-2 types, are the predominating strains circulating in China. The high variability of the new CPV-2a strains in our study may be attributed to long-term interactions between the new CPV-2a strains and their hosts. It is suggested that vaccinations against CPV-2 should be updated on the basis of these new CPV-2a strains.",

P\u00e9rez et al. (2014) revealed that a recombinant strain arose from inter-genotypic recombination between CPV-2c and CPV-2a strains within the VP1/VP2 gene boundary [55]. In our study, two inter-genotypic recombination events between the 13 CPV-2 strains in this study and the Chinese reference strains were identified in the VP2 gene. The two recombination events occurred between type new2a and 2c strains, resulting in two potential recombinant type new2a strains. Our finding is in line with the occurrence of a possible recombination event in the CPV-2 strain 364-rec, as described by P\u00e9rez et al. (2014) [55]. Although the evidence of naturally occurring recombination events was not obtained in our study, possible recombination events among Chinese CPV-2 strains suggest that co-infections with CPV-2 strains with different genotypes, especially types 2a and 2c, as well as potential recombinant strains of CPV-2, should be monitored in China by extensive molecular epidemiology investigations in the future.",

Compared with the previous epidemiological investigation of CPV-2 in China, the detailed information of samples used in our study, including collection date, location, animal breed, animal gender, animal age, animal immunization, and coinfection with other enteric viruses, resulted in the generation of more precise and valuable epidemiological data which not only enriches basic epidemiological data of Chinese CPV-2 strains, but also increases the understanding of epidemic characteristics of CPV-2 strains circulating in northeast China. In addition, our findings revealed novel epidemiological information of CPV-2 in China, involving in the co-circulation of new CPV-2a with high variation, new CPV-2b, and rare CPV-2c in Heilongjiang province of northeast China, the unique amino acids substitutions including Gln370Arg substitution in identified CPV-2c strains, and Thr440Ala substitution in identified new CPV-2b strains, and the potential recombination events which could happen among type new2a and 2c CPV-2 field strains circulating in China.",
