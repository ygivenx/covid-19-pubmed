            "text": "The Maastricht Treaty from 1992 marked the beginning of the health mandate of the European Union (EU) as enshrined today in Article 168 of the Lisbon Treaty (TFEU, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union)\n[1]. The original EU health mandate focused primarily on stimulating cooperation between member states and supporting national actions (Art. 129 (1), Treaty of the European Union (TEU))\n[2]. It embodied the Union with only limited legislative powers on health matters. Although this initial mandate was enhanced through subsequent Treaties, today Article 168, still gives the EU relatively circumscribed power in areas of public health (Art. 168 (4), TFEU). Healthcare continues to remain a national competence and in this regard, the EU \u201cshall respect the responsibilities of the member states for the definition of their health policy and for the organization and delivery of their health services\u201d (Art. 168 (7), TFEU). Despite the restricted Treaty-based mandate for health, the EU has a relevant role to play in national public health and health systems policies and has expanded its remit in areas beyond the Treaty\n[3]. Areas affected by EU provisions are extensively described in the literature\n[4-11]. To illustrate the main developments in the area of what can be called \u201cEU health policy\u201d a timeline is illustrated in Table \n1. However, because of its limited legal mandate, some EU legal initiatives were highly contested\n[12,13].",

            "text": "Therefore, one can pose the question of what has been achieved over the last twenty years. It may be argued that, despite its narrow legislative scope, the health mandate has triggered important European actions in certain public health areas like tobacco control\n[14,15], infectious disease control\n[16,17], European guidelines\n[18-20] and the development of an EU public health infrastructure\n[21]. In recent years, the EC has summarized in annual reports a diverse nature of key public health achievements such as communications and recommendations, health policies, EC co-financed actions and established networks (e.g. high level groups, scientific committees, platforms)\n[22-24]. However, stakeholders in the field provide examples indicating that public health relevant EU policies such as single EU policy assessments on the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP)\n[25,26], pharmaceuticals\n[27], or the Health in All Policy (HiAP) approach\n[28] do not always meet the expectations of the public health community. In these papers the authors express concerns about potentially detrimental health effects\n[25,26] or disappointment about the support of the policies and approaches aimed at improving health in Europe\n[27,28]. Also, EU agencies such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are described as agencies with a limited legal mandate, competences and resources for EU public health but, at the same time, with promising prospects to develop as a renowned international player in the field\n[29].",

During the course of this process, a list of public health relevant EU policy outputs, processes or procedures that were regarded as achievements, failures or missed opportunities were first gathered individually and then, following a group discussion, a common list was compiled. This output was used to construct the interview guide containing six guiding themes from which open-ended questions were formulated. The guiding themes included (1) a description of the individual role of the expert in European public health, (2) the individual definition of European public health, (3) the assessment of public health relevant EU-level actions as being an achievement, missed opportunity or failure, (4) the formulation of five influential European policy outputs, (5) consequences of European health policy, and (6) the policy process at the European level. The semi-structured interview guide was used as a framework for the interviews and allowed the interviewers to address other relevant topics that emerged during the interviews.",

Afterwards, a directed (or deductive) content analysis approach\n[35,36] was applied whereby the initially predefined coding scheme with the main categories of interest (achievement, failure, and missed opportunity) was used to summarize the respective topics and the reasoning that appeared during the interviews. Topics that did not fit into one of these main categories were added as new codes and were organized into new categories. The analysis was jointly performed by the principal investigators using NVivo 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 9).",

Thematic discussions on actions or policies related to the development of guidelines and indicators appeared with regard to infectious disease surveillance and management of rare diseases but were not a major theme across interviews. The EU-level task to promote best practice exchange among member states was regarded as influential, which is represented by a top position in one of the rankings presented in this paper. With regard to the task of establishing monitoring and evaluation structures, some respondents perceived the status of the EU health information system rather as a failure. This corresponds to observations in the literature indicating that although ground work such as the development of a common EU health indicator set is acknowledged\n[50,51] further efforts are needed to implement and maintain health indicators\n[51] and to develop a permanent and sustainable EU public health monitoring and reporting infrastructure that supports decision making in public health on EU level\n[50,51]. Respondents agreed that cooperation in the area of public health between member state representatives and experts as well as with other stakeholder groups has increased and has been facilitated by the EU through various projects, networks, forums, and platforms. This trend was mainly positively perceived since it supported EU-level public health policy by accumulating and exchanging knowledge, generating public support and a legitimacy to act on certain fields\n[3]. This finding is corroborated by the literature on the potential of new governance instruments for health- and social policy-making at EU-level\n[11,52-54]. However, these new governance instruments can also be regarded as a rather strategic investment of the EC to keep topics on the agenda until a political window of opportunity opens but as an ineffective policy tool to enforce and implement action in due course\n[6]. The collaboration of a diverse set of stakeholders as it is the case for example in the EU Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health can lead to actions that constitute rather a compromise of various interests. Consequently, the results might be disappointing from the viewpoint of public health experts\n[6,55]. A final judgment on the impact of facilitating collaboration is to be awaited and may only be made in the long term future. It will require different ways of measuring \u2018impact\u2019 compared to the analysis of domestic adaptations when implementing EU hard law\n[56].",

Therefore, convincing evidence is required to demonstrate the health impact of policies outside the health domain and strong partnerships are needed to counter strong industrial lobbying groups\n[6,57,58]. The ease of cooperation and the potential to achieve policy coherence between DG SANCO and DGs with stronger regulatory competences like the internal market (e.g. regarding tobacco, pharmaceuticals) or agriculture policy (regarding food safety, subsidies of unhealthy versus healthy food products) represented another characteristic that influenced the individual perception of EU public health policies. Experts who assessed the value of EU health policy actions under the reality of a rather weak health mandate were more likely to perceive EU actions as achievements. This was in contrast to others who strove for more appreciation of social and health matters in EU policies and who perceived a lot of missed opportunities or failures in this regard as the power of the EU was too weak to realize change and to fulfill the objective of the health mandate to ensure human health protection for citizens in the EU.",
