The long halftime points toward a complex cascade of events at the cell membrane prior to virus entry into host cells. It is assumed that the sequence is initiated upon virus binding to a primary receptor, from which the virus is released in a modified form, followed by re-binding to a secondary receptor complex, which is then endocytosed (Ozbun, 2019; Raff et al., 2013; Mikuli\u010di\u0107 and Florin, 2019).",

            "text": "To date, the requirements for virus association with the secondary entry receptor and the composition of the receptor complex are not well understood. One of its main components is the tetraspanin CD151. It localizes to the cell surface, enriched in domains that associate with HPV16 particles (Spoden et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2013). CD151 is essential for viral endocytosis (Spoden et al., 2008; Scheffer et al., 2013; Spoden et al., 2013; Scheffer et al., 2014; Fast et al., 2018) and co-internalizes with the virus via a clathrin-, caveolin-, and dynamin-independent endocytic pathway (Spoden et al., 2008; Spoden et al., 2013). Integrin complexes (\u03b16\u03b21/\u03b24) (Scheffer et al., 2013; Evander et al., 1997; McMillan et al., 1999), the annexin A2 heterotetramer (Woodham et al., 2012; Dziduszko and Ozbun, 2013), the cytoskeletal adaptor obscurin-like one protein (W\u00fcstenhagen et al., 2016), and the tetraspanin CD63 (Spoden et al., 2008) are further components of the entry receptor complex. In addition, growth factor receptors (GFR), in particular the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), were proposed as entry receptors for HPV16 (Surviladze et al., 2012) and multiple other viruses such as vaccinia, cytomegalo, herpes simplex, influenza, and hepatitis C virus (Sch\u00e4fer et al., 2015). Moreover, signal transduction like the activation of EGFR and ERK signaling is a prerequisite for HPV infection (Schelhaas et al., 2012; Surviladze et al., 2012).",

TAPI-0 and GW diminished infection, whereas the ADAM10 inhibitor GI showed no significant effect. This is pointing toward a requirement of ADAMs, in particular of ADAM17 rather than ADAM10. To differentiate between these two ADAMs with a more specific approach, ADAM17 or ADAM10 were depleted by siRNA knockdown. For ADAM10 and ADAM17, respectively, two different siRNAs were employed in three epithelial cell models, including HeLa cells, HaCaT cells, and primary normal human epithelial keratinocytes (NHEK). Under all conditions ADAM17 depletion consistently and strongly decreased infection (Figure 1A\u2013C). In contrast, ADAM10 depletion showed no clear effect (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D). ADAM17 was also required for the infection by two other highly oncogenic HPV types, HPV18 and HPV31 (Figure 1D). Altogether, this indicates that ADAM17 is important for the infection with oncogenic human papillomaviruses.",

Therefore, we asked whether ADAM17 is required for the association of HPV16 with CD151. Prior to testing the role of ADAM17, we characterized the time course of virus colocalization with the entry receptor component CD151. HaCaTs were incubated with PsVs for 15 min, washed, and fixed or incubated up to several hours prior to fixation. Directly after virus incubation (marked as time point 0:00), we found virus particles associated with the cell surface, but they poorly overlapped with CD151-enriched domains (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). One hour after adding PsVs (corresponds to time point 0:45), there was a moderate increase in CD151-L1 overlap that further increased in the next 2 hr, apparently plateauing after about 5 hr (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). This is in line with our previous time course analyses of the CD151-L1 interaction on HeLa cells (Spoden et al., 2008). This slow association of viral particles with CD151-enriched domains implies the idea of a slowly maturating HPV16 entry platform.",

Superresolution STED microscopy revealed a defined nanocluster pattern suggesting that larger CD151-enriched domains, as recorded by diffraction-limited microscopy, are in fact closely associated CD151 nanoclusters. The resolved nanocluster pattern enabled us to determine the distance between a bound viral particle to its next nearest CD151 nanocluster (Figure 2A). The average size of a CD151 cluster is roughly 200 nm (see Figure 4), and an HPV particle has a size of 55 nm (Baker et al., 1991). Therefore, distances shorter than 150 nm allow for physical contact between a viral particle and a CD151 nanocluster. Interestingly, we uncovered a large fraction of PsVs in close proximity to CD151 nano-clusters already directly after virus binding. The fraction of such closely associated viral particles strongly increases over time (Figure 2A and B). We cannot exclude that we underestimate the increase of this fraction due to preferential internalization of tight CD151-viral particle associates. Importantly, as well the CD151 brightness at the site of viral particle binding increases (Figure 2C), suggesting that the viral particle enriches CD151 in preparation of endocytosis.",

With TIRF microscopy, we studied the dynamics of viral particles and CD151. While viral particles were clearly immobile, CD151 moved fast (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). These observations are in line with previous reports showing HPV16 PsV confinement on the cell body (Schelhaas et al., 2008) and that CD81 tetraspanin clusters are stable only for a few seconds (Homsi et al., 2014). We cannot exclude that in our CD151 tracking study, in which diffraction limited microscopy did not well resolve individual CD151 nanoclusters, we monitor larger intracellular vesicles. However, if viral particles are stationary and tetraspanins are mobile (Espenel et al., 2008), platform maturation presumably involves CD151 nucleation at viral particle binding sites. The increase in CD151 intensity at PsVs binding sites (Figure 2C) illustrates this is a slow process that can take up to several hours.",

            "text": "Next, we tested whether ADAM17 plays a role in the association of viral particles and CD151-enriched domains in two different epithelial cell lines. 5 hr after initial PsVs contact, we found a significant effect. ADAM17 depletion reduced virus-CD151 overlap by roughly a third in HaCaTs or NHEK (Figure 2D\u2013F). The data reveals ADAM17-dependent spatial proximity between virus and CD151. Still, it is possible that viral particles and CD151 domains, although overlapping in the micrographs and exhibiting distances to each other below 150 nm, do not physically interact with each other. To corroborate spatial proximity with a better resolution, we turned to the Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Fredriksson et al., 2002; S\u00f6derberg et al., 2006). In the PLA bright fluorescent spots form at sites where two different molecular entities are closer than \u2248 40 nm (Bagchi et al., 2015; Mendez and Banerjee, 2017). Hence, in this assay fluorescent spots indicate sites at which viral particles and CD151 domains should indeed be close enough to interact physically. In the PLA, we found that the PLA signal was strongly dependent on ADAM17 (Figure 2G and H). Thus, the microscopic analysis and the PLA suggest that ADAM17 mediates close association between HPVs and CD151-enriched domains. This means that ADAM17 either is required for initial virus binding, or it plays a role somewhere between binding and endocytic platform formation, for example for L1 cleavage/priming by ADAM17 or another protease.",

Therefore, we exclude ADAM17 requirement for initial virus binding to the cell surface. Investigating the activity of ADAM17 (using TGF-\u03b1 as positive control) and the cleavage pattern of the viral L1 protein (L1 priming), we find that L1 is neither a substrate for ADAM17 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A and B) nor is internalization of viral particles efficiently inhibited by ADAM17 depletion (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C\u2013D). Instead, L1 cleavage products substantially decreased in ADAM17-depleted cells (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4E and F). Therefore, we speculate that ADAM17 activity is required for viral particle association with L1-priming proteases such as kallikrein-8 prior to endocytosis and additional proteases in intracellular compartments of the infectious entry pathway (Cerqueira et al., 2015). Inhibition of these early steps on the plasma membrane rather leads to virus internalization into a non-infectious entry pathway as described earlier (Selinka et al., 2007).",

This treatment ensures that only structures located at the plasma membrane are analyzed (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1). We find that CD151-enriched domains in PsVs-non-exposed cells have an average size of \u2248 210 nm (Figure 4B). Often several individual CD151 clusters gather together to groups (Figure 4A). PsVs reduced the cluster diameter to \u2248 150 nm, which is accompanied by a \u2248 25% reduction of the overall CD151 staining intensity (Figure 4B and C). A reduction of the CD151 plasma membrane level after viral uptake is expected, as CD151 is co-internalized with viral particles (Scheffer et al., 2013).

As expected, ADAM17 depletion in donor cells strongly diminished their infection, but also halved the infection of non-ADAM17-depleted recipient cells (Figure 5C). This demonstrates that virus particles were released from donor cells and diffused to the recipient cells. However, there are several possible explanations for the lower infection rate of non-ADAM17-depleted recipient cells: recipients have received (i) less virus particles, (ii) the same amount but less infectious particles, or (iii) less bioactive molecules required for signaling pathway activation.",

            "text": "Are then virus particles less infectious when released from ADAM17-depleted cells? To test this, the co-culture assay was performed under inverted conditions. Non-treated donor cells were incubated with HPV16 PsVs to ensure the release of identical virus particles for control and ADAM17-depleted recipient cells. In the case that released viral particles require ADAM17 for being infectious, ADAM17 depletion in recipient cells should have no effect on their infection rate. However, we observed the opposite, infection in recipient cells was almost completely blocked (Figure 5E, lower panel). Therefore, the involvement of ADAM17 in the release of soluble bioactive compounds, as for example growth factors, which activate specific signaling pathways for infection and can also decorate the virus (Surviladze et al., 2012), might explain these findings. Hence, bioactive molecules are required for viral infection, no matter whether the viral particle is released and re-binds to the cell or not. The hypothesis on the involvement of released growth factors is supported by the observation that the non-ADAM17-depleted donor cells in the inverted assay configuration are significantly less infected when the corresponding recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted (Figure 5E, upper panel). In contrast to one-directional diffusion of virus particles, bioactive compounds are exchanged in both directions, meaning that the donor cells sense less bioactive compounds when the recipient cells are ADAM17-depleted. However, the effect is small, suggesting that biomolecules rather act locally and do not diffuse over large distances. We further speculate that, although viral particles are released, they relatively fast rebind to cell surface receptors, explaining the large fraction of virus particles binding close to CD151 clusters already after 15 min (Figure 2B).",

The literature suggests a link between ADAM17 and infection pathways regulated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 signaling pathway because HPV16 infection requires activation of ERK signaling via EGFR (Surviladze et al., 2012) and ADAM17 mediates cleavage of growth factors that activate ERK1/2 (Kansra et al., 2004; G\u00f6oz et al., 2006; Sommer et al., 2016). Thus, we used the EGFR blocking-antibody Cetuximab to confirm the functional requirement of EGFR in HPV16 PsVs infection (Figure 6A). Next, we tested whether ADAM17 is required for ERK1/2 phosphorylation in our system (Figure 6B and C, and Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A and B). We found that in HaCaT cells ADAM17 depletion reduces ERK1/2 phosphorylation, independent from the treatment with PsVs.",

Moreover, infection analyses showed that infection rates were significantly reduced when AREG or TGF-\u03b1 neutralizing antibodies were added to the cells 1 hr before HPV16 PsVs addition (Figure 7C).

For example, EGF increases the infection rate of ADAM17-depleted cells, EGF increases the proximity between L1 and CD151 after ADAM17 knockdown, and ADAM17 knockdown diminishes the overlap between L1 and EGFR. However, EGF is not classically generated by the action of ADAM17 (Sahin et al., 2004; Horiuchi et al., 2007). Therefore, we tested the involvement of additional EGFR ligands generated by ADAM17 ectodomain shedding. We find less AREG and TGF-\u03b1 in the supernatant of ADAM17-depleted cells, corroborated by a reduction of the infection rate after treatment with AREG and TGF-\u03b1 neutralizing antibodies. Adding ADAM17 cleavage products such as AREG, TGF-\u03b1, and HB-EGF to the supernatant of serum-starved or ADAM17-depleted cells increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation and infection. The effect of EGFR, AREG or TGF-\u03b1 inhibition is much lower than that of the ADAM17 siRNA, therefore, we have to assume that ADAM17 activates not only the EGFR but also the additional GFRs.",

Due to the plethora of ADAM17 substrates (Gooz, 2010; Reiss and Saftig, 2009; Edwards et al., 2008) and the complex crosstalk between signaling pathways, also, ADAM17-dependent shedding of additional membrane-bound precursors and cleavage of integral membrane proteins might be involved in this scenario.",

Accordingly, we observed a reduction of CD151 levels in the plasma membrane only in the presence of PsVs and ADAM17. Furthermore, we observed an ADAM17-dependent cleavage of the L1 protein. It has been described that L1 cleavage occurs by the action of specific proteases on the cell surface and after internalization via the infectious entry pathway (Cerqueira et al., 2015). However, our findings suggest that ADAM17 has no direct effect on extra- or intracellular processing of the virus particle or virus internalization. Instead, affected L1 cleavage is a consequence of virus internalization into a non-infectious pathway and reduced capsid interaction with proteases resident within the entry platform complex or in the endosomal pathway. Thus, ADAM17 mediates virus association with the functional HPV-endocytic platform enabling host cell entry via the infectious pathway.",

This points toward a general scheme in viral uptake independent from the virus structure, further supported by the notion that tetraspanins stand for essential components of entry receptor complexes for corona-, influenza-, hepatitis C and other viruses (Zona et al., 2013; Earnest et al., 2015; Fast et al., 2017; Florin and Lang, 2018).

Furthermore, tetraspanin CD151 regulates integrin activities by influencing their positioning within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (Berditchevski et al., 2001; Stipp, 2010; Yang et al., 2004). Crowding of CD151 at the sites where virus particles are bound results in co-accumulation of additional virus interacting molecules, laminin and integrin complexes, which is in line with our previous analysis on CD151 mutants demonstrating the importance of CD151/integrin complex formation in HPV16 infection (Scheffer et al., 2013).

            "text": "In summary, much work has been done to unveil the process of human papillomavirus entry. Although for this puzzling process diverse host cell factors and many steps have been proposed so far, the precise description still remains controversial. In order to deepen our understanding of these early steps of infection, we investigated the requirements for HPV16 entry platform formation. We propose a model in which ADAM17 acts by the shedding of growth factors. These molecules trigger ERK signaling activation and thereby mediate the co-clustering of preformed larger CD151-EGFR microdomains and HPV16 in the plasma membrane. These events lead to the assembly of a functional virus entry platform, priming of the HPV capsid proteins, endocytosis into the infectious pathway and eventually infection.",

Two-color STED-microscopy was realized by sequential imaging of the two channels, using pulsed 561 nm and 640 nm lasers for the excitation of Alexa 594 and 647, respectively. For depletion, a pulsed 775 nm STED laser was used. Signals emitted from Alexa Fluor 594 and Alexa 647 dyes were detected using 580\u2013630 nm and 650\u2013720 filters, respectively. Depending on the experiment, pixel size was set to 15 nm for membrane sheets and 25 nm for cells. For all images, pinhole size was set to 60 \u00b5m. For the imaging of membrane sheets, the focal plane was adjusted slightly above and below the membrane sheet in order to check its two-dimensional structure briefly before imaging. This is possible because membrane sheets become immediately unfocussed when the focal plane is displaced in the z-axis, whereas cells or incompletely generated membrane sheets still show structural elements (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1).",

The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between two channels was calculated with a custom ImageJ macro. For analyzing maxima parameters (size, distances, intensity), a custom ImageJ macro was used. The macro is based on the ImageJ function \u2018Find Maxima\u2019 which is used to detect clusters or viral particles and gives their position in pixel coordinates. Prior to maxima detection, images were smoothed with a Gaussian blur (\u03c3 = 1) to reduce false positive maxima due to noise. Cluster intensities were calculated by centering five pixel diameter circular ROIs onto the cluster positions. Cluster intensities were averaged for each cell. The exact cluster and PsV positions were determined by calculating the center of mass of fluorescence within the circular ROIs and used for further analysis. Maxima with low mean intensity (< 2 - 5 a.u., depending on the experiment and channel) were excluded. Intensity measurements were corrected for local background measured next to the cell. For each PsV, the distances to the CD151 clusters were calculated, and the shortest distance was determined. In some cases, we found only a few PsVs per cell. Therefore, all PsV distances were averaged for one condition from one biological replicate (roughly 20 cells). The cluster size was determined by applying a horizontal and a vertical 3 \u00d7 31 pixels line scan centered at the cluster position. The linescans were fitted to a Gaussian yielding the full width at half maximum, which corresponds to the cluster size. Depending on the fit quality, either the value from the horizontal or vertical line scan was used. Clusters that have both fits with a R-square R2 < 0.8 (centered peak) were excluded. The cluster size values for each membrane sheet were averaged. Measurements of the CD151 level were performed in the same ROIs as used for the cluster size analysis. Intensity measurements were corrected for local background measured next to the membrane sheets.",

HaCaT cells were depleted of ADAM17 for 48 hr, afterwards starved in medium without FCS and 24 hr later supernatants were collected. Supernatants (n = 24) were analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test: p=3.06E-09. Release of AREG is given as mean \u00b1 SEM and the mean for control siRNA-treated cells (contr. si) was set to 100%. (B) Knockdown of ADAM17 decreases release of human TGF\u03b1 (Ectodomain shedding assay). HeLa cells were treated with ADAM17-specific siRNA, 24 hr later transfected with alkaline phosphatase-tagged TGF\u03b1 plasmid and the next day incubated in the fresh medium without FCS for 3 hr at 37\u00b0C. Supernatants (n = 7) were analyzed with two sample t-test: p=1.83E-09. The release of transfected AP-tagged TGF\u03b1, used as readout for ADAM17 activity, is shown as a percentage and the mean for control siRNA-treated cells was set to 100%. (C) AREG and TGF\u03b1 neutralizing antibodies significantly diminish HPV16 infection rate. HaCaT cells were pre-treated with specified antibodies murine IgG (contr.), AREG or TGF\u03b1 for 1 hr, infected with PsVs and analyzed 24 hr later. Data for AREG (n = 6) were analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test: p=0.227 (AREG 0.1 ng/ml), Welch two sample t- test: p=0.011 (AREG 1 ng/ml) and two sample t-test: p=1.05E-04 (AREG 5 ng/ml). Data for TGF\u03b1 (n = 6) were analyzed with two sample t-test: p=1.35E-06 (TGF\u03b1 0.1 ng/ml) and p=1.20E-03 (TGF\u03b1 1 ng/ml) and Wilcoxon rank sum test: p=4.77E-03 (TGF\u03b1 5 ng/ml). The values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM and the mean of all tested concentrations for murine IgG-treated cells (contr.) was set to 100%. (D) HaCaT cells were depleted of ADAM17 for 48 hr. Next, cells were starved for 4 hr in medium without FCS, either left non-treated or treated with depicted concentrations of different GFs for 15 min. Western blots show phosphorylated and total ERK1 and ERK2 for the indicated conditions; \u03b1-tubulin was used as a loading control. (E) The amount of phosphorylated ERK1 (in black) and ERK2 (in gray) is shown as a ratio of phosphorylated to total ERK form. Data for ERK1 (n = 4) were analyzed with Welch two sample t-test: p=0.034 (HB-EGF 20 ng/ml), p=0.036 (TGF\u03b1 20 ng/ml), p=0.022 (AREG 20 ng/ml), p=0.018 (AREG 100 ng/ml) and p=3.70E-03 (pool).
