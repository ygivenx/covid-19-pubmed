Recently, we engineered a soluble one domain CD4 (mD1.22) which can bind and neutralize all tested isolates as a component of a bispecific multivalent protein9. Thus, we have hypothesized that a bispecific fusion protein containing mD1.22 fused to an antibody arm that binds to CD16A on NK cells, not only would presumably neutralize all HIV-1 isolates but also could guide and activate natural killer (NK) cells to find and kill HIV-1 infected cells expressing its envelope glycoprotein (Env, gp120-gp41) at their surface. The capability of NK cells to kill target cells specifically by using bispecific antibodies to both CD16 and target cells was demonstrated more than 30 years ago10. However, it was not until relatively recently when such bispecific molecules called Bispecific Killer cell Engagers (BiKEs) were successfully used against cancer in a clinical trial11.",

Decreasing the size of the proteins can dramatically increase their effective diffusion coefficients, e.g., decreasing the size from 150 kDa to about 15 kDa can increase the diffusion through normal solid tissue about 100-fold12. Therefore, in an attempt to decrease the size of BiKEs we also used antibody domain binders to CD16A which we recently identified and described13. We have hypothesized that BiKEs generated by fusing the one domain CD4 through a flexible linker to an antibody domain binder to CD16A would have relatively small size which could allow them to effectively penetrate tissues and guide the NK cells to kill HIV-1 infected cells.",

Importantly, in the presence of cells expressing Env, these BiKEs activated specifically the CD16A-expressing Jurkat T cells as well as induced the degranulation of NK cells and resulted in killing of the Env-expressing cells. Furthermore, these BiKEs mediated effective killing of HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To our knowledge these are the first human domain-based BiKEs and the first against HIV-1 based on CD4; we found only one other report published as an extended abstract about BiKEs against HIV-1 based on an anti-CD16A llama domain and the VRC01 Fab18. The possibility that our CD4-based BiKEs can bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with their high-affinity and specific, activating interactions with CD16A resulting in lysis of HIV-1 infected cells suggest that they are promising candidate therapeutics and worth of further evaluation in animal models and potentially in humans for therapy of HIV-1 infections with the final goal of its eradication.",

Both BiKEs bound comparably to 293 T cells and CHO-ZA cells permanently expressing gp160 (gp120-gp41) (Fig. 3b,d\n) but not to un-transfected 293 T cells and CHO-ZA cells (Fig. 3c,e\n). Interestingly, the fluorescence shift for BiKEs binding to CHO-ZA-gp160sc cells was substantially larger than binding to 293T-gp160sc cells, which is consistent with binding of other two Env binders, b1219 and LSEVh-LS-F20, to these two cell lines (Supplemental Fig. 1\n) and indicated that CHO-ZA cells expressed higher level of surface-associated gp160sc than 293 T cells did after transfection.

In Jurkat T-CD16A cells, engagement of CD16A initiates activation signals through the CD3-\u03b6 chain, ultimately leading to de-phosphorylation of NTAFp (Nuclear factor of activated T-cells) and expression of luciferase (Promega, ADCC Reporter Bioassay). Thus, the activation signals could be monitored by testing luciferase activity. To compare the ADCC capacities of BiKEs and IgG1-Fc, we also measured the ADCC activation signals mediated by mD1.22-Fc, an Fc fusion protein with bivalent mD1.22. BiKEs and mD1.22-Fc can specifically activate Jurkat T-CD16A cells in the presence of 293T-gp160SC cells (Fig. 4a\n). The incubation of BiKEs with Jurkat T-CD16A cells in the absence of target cells or in the presence of 293 T cells non-expressing gp160 could not induce luciferase signals, demonstrating the high specificities of these BiKEs. Importantly, they can activate Jurkat T-CD16A cells at low concentrations (50% RLU at 0.2 nM). In this case the activity of mbk6 was higher than that of mbk11 and mD1.22-Fc indicating a correlation of binding affinity of BiKEs to CD16A (mD1.22-Fc < mbk11 < mbk6) with their functional activity.\n",

Co-incubation of Jurkat T-CD16A cells with BiKEs opsonized 293T-gp160SC cells resulted in release of IL-2 (Fig. 4b\n), which is consistent with the results obtained by using a positive control, bivalent 3G8. By contrast, the BiKEs alone or incubated with 293 T cells, or 293T-gp160SC alone did not induce IL-2 secretion, demonstrating the high specificity of these BiKEs. The higher affinity mbk6 induced more IL-2 than mbk11 (p = 0.022) but less than 3G8, which again indicates that there could be correlation between affinity/avidity and cytokine release activity. However, when T cells were stimulated by 293T-gp160SC cells, mbk6 was almost as effective as 3G8 suggesting a role for avidity effects. These results demonstrate that both BiKEs could specifically engage CD16A on the effector cell surface, and activate signals leading to cytokine release.",

It should be also noted that the CHO-ZA-gp160SC cells and CHO-ZA cells in the absence of BiKEs also could induce relatively weak NK cells degranulation, which may result from killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) recognition of Env or other ligands on target cells21. This is independent on CD16A mediated NK cells engagement. Induced expression of intracellular IFN\u03b3 was also observed although the level was not as high as the CD107a expression (Supplemental Fig. 2\n). This is consistent with previous observation that CD107a is a more comprehensive and sensitive marker of NK cells activation than cytokine secretion22. It should be noted that our CD107a and IFN-\u03b3 levels are lower than those induced by the VRCO1 based BiKEs18, which may result from the different experimental conditions such as different Env expression levels or NK cells donors or incubation time.

Thus, mbk6 and mbk11 could potentially bypass the hurdles encountered by IgG-Fc mediated ADCC, such as competition by endogenous IgG29 and limitations due to the CD16A 158 V/F polymorphism30 as well as non-specific engagement of other Fc\u03bbRs31. Our antibody domains are also devoid of N-glycosylation, i.e., they do not contain glycans (as Fc does) which could complicate IgG-Fc mediated ADCC by different glycoforms32.",

            "text": "Mbk6 and mbk11 were constructed by linking two single fully human domains via three repeats of a poly-peptide, GGGGS. Unlike the typical BiKEs consisting of two tandem single chain variable fragments (scFv), which usually encounter undesirable expression and folding issues33, our BiKEs only contain two immunoglobulin domains with total molecular weight of ~ 28 kD (Fig. 1b\n). This simple format renders our BiKEs with high expression in E. coli (50 mg/L) and homogenous folding in solution (Fig. 1c\n). To our knowledge, these are the first BiKEs reported which are entirely based on domains and therefore are of relatively very small size. The small size is important because their penetration in normal tissues including lymphoid tissue where HIV-1 mostly replicates could be significantly higher than antibody fragments and antibody fusion proteins. For example, a previous study has shown that a full size antibody (IgG1) of MW about 150 kDa has an effective diffusion coefficient about 100-fold lower in solid tissues than molecules 10-fold smaller12. Therefore, the effect of size could be significant. Our BiKEs are also fully human and may not exhibit immunogenicity if administered to humans. However, only further experiments in animal models of HIV-1 infection and ultimately human clinical trials will show whether they are immunogenic or not, and if immunogenic how immunogenic they are. Previously, a llama antibody domain that binds with high affinity to CD16A was identified16 and used for generation of two BiKEs targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)34 and Her235. These BiKEs were successful in CD16A mediated lysis of target cells thus demonstrating for the first time that antibody domains are functional as components of BiKEs. Here, we present evidence confirming such statement and further expanding it with the use of fully human domains fused to another human protein domain (mD1.22).",

These BiKEs could also induce NK cells degranulation after encountering target cells and the activated NK cells could kill target cells expressing the HIV-1 Env (CHO-ZA-gp160SC). Importantly, our small BiKEs could effectively engage PBMCs to kill chronically HIV-1 infected cells (8E5 cells) constitutively expressing the Env as well as acutely HIV-1 infected CEM cells by a subtype B strain, HIV-1NL4-3 and a recent primary isolate 2016GXEU02. These results are very promising although only further experiments in animal models of HIV-1 infection and ultimately human clinical trials will show whether they are highly effective in vivo.",

Interestingly, in these assays, mbk6 could engage effector cells more efficiently than mbk11, and mbk11 was more effective than mD1.22-Fc, which correlates with their CD16A binding affinity: mbk6 (~1 nM) > mbk11 (~21 nM) > Fc (0.1\u20131 \u03bcM). These results indicate that binding affinity of mbk6, mbk11 and mD1.22-Fc to CD16A correlates with their functional efficacy, given their identical epitopes on gp120 (CD4 binding site) and similar epitopes on CD16A13. Therefore, one could speculate that our high affinity BiKEs could function more effectively than HIV-1 bnAbs with CD4 binding site epitopes although we did not compare side by side the ADCC efficacy of BiKEs and bnAbs in this study.",

The high affinity to CD16A of BiKEs could result in binding to NK cells even when the CD16A expression level is low. Another consideration is that NK cells in the solid lymphoid organs and mucosae, where HIV-1 mostly replicates, are mainly CD56pos phenotype, rather than the cytotoxic CD16pos due to the decreased expression of the tissue-homing receptors on CD16pos NK cells during the HIV-1 progression28, 38. The high affinity to CD16A could maximize the engagement of the low CD16pos cell number in solid lymphoid tissues to kill HIV-1-infected cells. It can be also important in cases when the Env is expressed at low surface concentrations especially in chronically and latently infected cells39. Therefore, the high binding affinity of our BiKEs to both CD16A and gp120 could be important for their in vivo efficacy.",

All results, including activation and cytokine secretion by Jurkat T-CD16A cells, NK cell degranulation and killing of Env-expressing cells or HIV-1 infected cells, consistently were highly dependent on the presence of both BiKEs and target cells. BiKEs alone could neither activate Jurkat T-CD16A, nor induce degranulation of NK cells. Co-incubation of target cells with effector cells in the absence of BiKEs or co-incubation of Env-negative control cells with effector cells in the presence of BiKEs could not lead to the target cell killing. Although in the NK cell degranulation assays, co-incubation of NK cells with CHO-ZA-gp160SC cells in the absence of BiKEs did induce very low expression of CD107A, it may result from the direct engagement of other receptors on NK cell surface such as KIRs and NCRs21, 24, which is independent of CD16A and BiKEs. Of note is that we have previously shown that one-domain CD4 (mD1.22) doesn\u2019t bind MHC class II molecules9. Thus, our data suggest that the activity of these BiKEs is highly specific.",
