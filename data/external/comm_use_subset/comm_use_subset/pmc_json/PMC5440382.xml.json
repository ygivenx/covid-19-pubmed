These viruses are speculated to have spilled over from bats to humans and other animals, directly or through intermediate hosts, causing severe and often fatal disease. Despite evidence of bats harbouring these viruses, or viruses closely related to them, bats do not appear to show overt symptoms or clinical signs of infection6. Infecting Pteropid, Jamaican and Egyptian fruit bats with Nipah and Hendra viruses, MERS-CoV and Ebolavirus yielded no evidence of disease. The bats sero-converted and in some cases virus could be detected post infection7\u201310, but these bats did not demonstrate signs of illness. We do not completely understand why bats are less susceptible to these viral infections than other mammals that often succumb.",

Both branches are distinct, although there is interaction between them. During viral infection, the innate response is the first line of defence and primes the adaptive immune response against the virus12, 13. A virus infected cell detects several pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with the virus through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in endosomal compartments, cytoplasm and cell membrane [reviewed by Mogensen14]. Some of these PRRs, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, 8, 9, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5), have specifically evolved to recognise microbial nucleic acids [reviewed by Lee and Kim15]. Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] is a known double-stranded RNA analogue which is detected by TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5. After detection, PRRs signal through mediators to activate two pathways - the antiviral cytokine (interferons) and inflammatory pathways16.",

Five members of the NF\u03baB family of proteins have been identified in humans, namely, RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF\u03baB-1 (p50) and NF\u03baB-2 (p52). All five members form homo- or hetero-dimers and share some structural features. These dimers are bound by molecules of the inhibitor of NF\u03baB (I\u03baB) family and retained in the cytoplasm of the cell in an inactivated state. After PAMP recognition, downstream signals mark the inhibitors for degradation and the dimers translocate to the nucleus of the cell to cause expression of antiviral and inflammatory genes17 (Fig. 1). Different combinations of the proteins have vastly different effects on gene expression18. For instance, hetero-dimers of p50 or p52 and p65 or RelB activate transcription. In contrast, c-Rel as a homo-dimer or in association with p50 or p65, represses transcriptional activation by NF\u03baB19.\n",

These are known stimulants for human TLRs 3, 7/8 and 9 respectively. We compared the response of immortalized E. fuscus kidney cells (Efk3)35 as well as E. fuscus bone marrow derived myeloid cells stimulated with poly(I:C) with that of human fibroblast cells (MRC5). We quantified the expression of innate response genes including IFN\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), interleukin 8 (IL8) and others using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We observed that both bat and human cells mounted a strong IFN\u03b2 response but only human cells expressed high levels of transcripts for proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL8 after TLR ligand treatments. To further explore the low TNF\u03b1 response in bat cells, we analyzed the E. fuscus TNF\u03b1 promoter for transcription factor binding motifs and identified a potential binding site for c-Rel proto-oncoprotein, a known suppressor of gene expression36. Ectopically expressed c-Rel bound to DNA containing this motif and the protein localized to the nucleus of bat cells in response to poly(I:C). Deletion of this motif in the promoter enhanced activation by poly(I:C) and partial knockdown of bat c-Rel RNA by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased basal levels of TNF\u03b1 transcripts in bat cells. We could detect c-Rel transcripts in every major big brown bat tissue, such as spleen, gut, ileum, kidney, lung, liver and the bat kidney cell line, unlike in humans, where it is found predominantly in hematopoetic cells37. Finally, we could also demonstrate that bat c-Rel bound to the potential motif as promoters containing the motif were co-immunoprecipitated to higher levels than promoters that lacked this motif. Our results suggest that bats might have evolved a unique mechanism to suppress an exaggerated inflammatory response to viruses.",

We observed a heightened innate response with poly(I:C) in bat cells but not as much with ssRNA and CpG ODN (see Supplementary Table S2). We therefore decided to further analyse the cytokine response in bat and human cells to poly(I:C). While both MRC5 and Efk3 cells responded to poly(I:C) with a robust increase in IFN\u03b2 transcripts (Fig. 2a), only MRC5 cells responded with increased levels of TNF\u03b1 RNA (Fig. 2b). Poly(I:C)-treated Efk3 cells contained, on an average, 2.4 fold more TNF\u03b1 transcripts than mock-treated cells, as compared to a 315-fold increase in human cells (Fig. 2b). We therefore examined further the response of these two genes. To determine when IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 transcripts are expressed following poly(I:C) treatment, we quantified IFN\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 transcripts in MRC5 and Efk3 cells at different times after poly(I:C) treatment. Both MRC5 and Efk3 cells showed highest IFN\u03b2 transcript levels at 9 h post-transfection (Fig. 2c). TNF\u03b1 transcript levels were highest at 12 h post-transfection in MRC5 cells and there was relatively little expression in Efk3 cells (Fig. 2d). To rule out the possibility of Efk3 cells not being able to mount a TNF\u03b1 response, we transfected bone marrow derived myeloid cells from big brown bat long bones with poly(I:C).

We challenged big brown bat bone marrow derived myeloid cells and the kidney cell line with poly(I:C) and quantified the transcripts for representative antiviral and inflammatory genes. Inflammatory cytokine transcripts for TNF\u03b1, IL8 and IL1\u03b2 (see Supplementary Table S2) in Efk3 cells and TNF\u03b1 in big brown bat bone marrow derived myeloid cells were not expressed to levels observed in MRC5 cells.

For instance, hetero-dimers of p50 or p52 and p65 or RelB activate transcription. In contrast, c-Rel as a homo-dimer or in association with p50 and p65, repress transcriptional activation by NF\u03baB19 and c-Rel has been previously shown to be a repressor of certain gene promoters in human cells, such as Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EPHB2) in colorectal cancer cells36. We detected a putative c-Rel binding motif in the big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter. Deleting this motif reversed the bat promoter activity after poly(I:C) treatment and partial knockdown of c-Rel RNA significantly increased basal TNF\u03b1 transcript levels in bat cells demonstrating the ability of c-Rel to repress the TNF\u03b1 promoter in bat cells.",

In addition, Ench\u00e9ry and Horvat have also speculated that the positive selection of c-Rel may contribute to bats\u2019 immunovirological peculiarities55. Our results suggest that the positive selection of c-Rel may also have been driven by the need to dampen the destructive effects of inflammation in response to viral infections. Zhang et al. also identified mutations in the REL homology domain (RHD) of c-Rel that could potentially affect the binding of I\u03baB and speculated that this may allow nuclear transport in the absence of TLR3 stimulation54. These mutations are also present in big brown bat c-Rel (see Supplementary Fig. S4). However, we did find that while ectopically expressed bat c-Rel was present in both cytoplasm and nucleus, poly(I:C) stimulation increased translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 7a). The mutations, therefore, do not completely obviate TLR3 control.",

Primers for Efk3 cells were designed using the annotated big brown bat genome (Accession No. PRJNA72449). Primer sequences for MRC5 cells were obtained from PrimerBank58, 59 or nucleotide database on National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). When primer sequences were not available for MRC5 or genes not annotated for big brown bat, multiple sequence alignment was performed with other mammalian homologues and primers were designed against conserved regions. One of the cytokines, IL8, is not annotated in the big brown bat genome. Primers for IL8 were designed using the annotated Myotis lucifugus genome. The products were quantified based on the amount of relative gene expression. All amplified products were confirmed on a gel and sequenced (Macrogen). Reaction efficiencies for qRT-PCR primers were between 95 and 105%.",

RNA viruses during replication produce double-stranded RNA intermediates (PAMPs), which are detected by cellular receptors (PRRs). Poly(I:C) is a known double-stranded RNA analogue (activator) which is detected by sensors such as TLR3 (black), RIGI and MDA5 (blue, CARD domains in yellow) in a cell. These sensors, when stimulated by the activator, lead to the expression of interferons (IFN\u03b2) and inflammatory genes (TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL8) through adaptor proteins (MAVS and MyD88) and signal mediators such as NF\u03baB (orange and yellow subunits) and IRF3. NF\u03baB is retained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm by inhibitory molecules such as I\u03baB (blue). Upon receiving an activation signal via a sensor, kinases (TBK1) phosphorylate IRF3, which then translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription. Kinases, such as IKK \u03b1, \u03b2 or \u03b3 phosphorylate I\u03baB inhibitors and mark them for degradation, thereby activating NF\u03baB.

We co-transfected plasmids expressing HA-tagged bat c-Rel and human/bat TNF\u03b1 wildtype/mutant promoters in HEK293T cells. We immunoprecipitated c-Rel using HA-specific antibodies and quantified the amount of TNF\u03b1 promoter pulled down by qRT-PCR. (a) Bat c-Rel pulled down a significantly (P = 0.021) higher amount of wildtype big brown bat TNF\u03b1 promoter that contained the putative c-Rel binding motif over the mutant promoter in which the motif was deleted (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 4). (b) Bat c-Rel pulled down a significantly (P = 0.021) higher amount of mutant human TNF\u03b1 promoter which contained the putative bat c-Rel binding motif over the human wildtype TNF\u03b1 promoter, which lacked the c-Rel binding motif (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 4). qRT-PCR products obtained from quantifying the immunoprecipitated samples were electrophoresed on a gel and their representative cropped images are shown. Full length gel images are shown in Supplemental Fig. S5. Images have been acquired from two different gels.
