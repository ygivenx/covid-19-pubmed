Researchers, physicians, and healthcare professionals work together to evaluate their pandemic potentials and plan mitigating strategies. For entry into hosts, viruses bind to surface molecules on the plasma membrane of susceptible cells \u2010 such as macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, endothelial cells, and hepatocytes and lead to them being internalized into vesicles which traffic through the endosomal/lysosomal pathways (Kissing et al. 2014; Shivanna et al. 2014; Bekerman and Einav 2015; Ekins et al. 2015; Kraft et al. 2015; Long et al. 2015). In order to infect susceptible cells, the viruses require endosomal/lysosomal acidification and the acidic pH dependent endosomal proteases cleave the viral glycoprotein segments to cross the replication events (Chandran et al. 2005; Marzi et al. 2012). Without endosomal acidification and cleavage processes, the viral replication and infection are abrogated (Martinson et al. 2014; Shivanna et al. 2014). Therefore, targeting the endosomal/lysosomal acidification and their acidic pH dependent proteases by the therapeutic agents will be highly effective in combating the present world viral epidemic.",

If the immune system of patients is able to control the infection, the patients recover, though convalescence is prolonged and recovered patients have been shown to produce infectious virus up to 3 months after clinical symptoms have disappeared. However, if the immune system of patients is unable to regulate the infection, further susceptible cells are infected, leading to excessive release of the above cytokines. This manifestation is fatal because extensive necrotic cells are present in many organs \u2010 including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and kidney (Leroy et al. 2000; Baize et al. 2002).",

Concomitant with the emergence of chloroquine\u2010resistant Plasmodium strains and a subsequent decrease in the use as antimalarial drugs, new potential uses of the cheap and available analogs have been investigated. Due to their immunomodulatory effects, the analogs have been used as secondary drugs to treat a variety of chronic autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus etc.), tumors, and nonmalarial infections (Al\u2010Bari 2015). Recently, several efforts have been made to identify effective, inexpensive, and universally available antiviral agents. In these senses, the analogs have been suggested as such antiviral agents by inhibiting the replications and infections (Geisbert et al. 2003; Savarino et al. 2003; Barrow et al., 2013).",

The unprotonated form of chloroquine diffuses spontaneously and rapidly across the membranes of cells and organelles to acidic cytoplasmic vesicles such as endosomes, lysosomes, or Golgi vesicles and thereby increases their pH (Al\u2010Bari 2015). On oral administration, the analog is readily absorbed and concentrated in tissues such as the liver, spleen, and kidney (Al\u2010Bari 2015)\u2010 where several fatal viruses harbored, replicated, and infected (Geisbert et al. 2003). In cellular levels of the tissues, chloroquine becomes highly concentrated in such acidic organelles leading to dysfunction of several enzymes, e.g. those required for proteolytic processing and post\u2010translational modification of viral proteins (Fig. 1) (Savarino et al. 2003; Marzi et al. 2012). Consequently, chloroquine analogs inhibit the production of several cytokines, chemokines or mediators, whose excessive appearance contributes the severity of viral infections. Therefore, the inhibition of endosomal acidification by chloroquine analogs may become a potential therapeutic strategy for viral infections and associated pathologies.",

            "text": "The increasing evidence suggests that the entry, replication and infection processes of several viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, dengue, Chikungunya, HIV etc. are highly dependent on endosomal\u2010lysosomal acidification and the activities of several host endosomal proteases \u2010 which are also active in acidic pH environments (Sun and Tien 2012; Barrow et al. 2013). By neutrality of acidic pH in endosomes, chloroquine analogs inhibit these viral entry and replication processes into the cytoplasm of susceptible cells and thereby abrogate their infections (Chiang et al. 1996; Savarino et al. 2003). Furthermore, the dysfunction of various enzymes e.g. glycosylating enzymes, glycosyltransferases caused by increased acidic pH and/or structural changes in the Golgi apparatus with hydroxychloroquine or by specific interaction with chloroquine, have been shown to suppress not only glycosylation of SARS\u2010 coronaviruses (Vincent et al. 2005; Savarino et al. 2006) but also that of the HIV\u20101 gp120 envelope protein, resulting in structural changes in the gp120 glycoprotein, which in turn reduce the reactivity and infectivity of newly produced virions (Savarino et al. 2004; Naarding et al. 2007). Since the surface glycoproteins of filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) involve in initiation of infection (Takada et al. 1997; Yang et al. 2000), and cytotoxicity (Yang et al. 2000), the inhibition of glycosylation by the analogs prevents the viral entries for a wide variety of host cells and leads to suppress their pathogenicity by producing of noninfectious or decreased infectivity viruses. This inhibited glycosylation will therefore allow time for the adaptive immune response to deal with the infection (Baize et al. 1999).",

            "text": "The anti\u2010inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of chloroquine analogs have also been beneficial in the treatment of viral infections and associated pathologies (Al\u2010Bari 2015). Several studies have suggested that multiple organ failure and hypovolemic shock observed in fatal cases are most likely associated with not only the direct viral infection and destruction of susceptible cells (e.g., endothelial cells), but also the effects of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators released from infected and activated cells such as monocytes and macrophages (Yang et al. 1998; Baize et al. 2002; Marzi et al. 2012; Geisbert et al. 2015). One of the cytokines strongly implicated in filoviral pathologies is tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) which is able to activate macrophages to release mediators such as ROS, NO and other molecules of TNF\u2010\u03b1. These cytokines cause to increase both the permeability and infectivity of endothelial cells (Tracey and Cerami 1994; Baize et al. 2002). It is suggested that therapeutic agents like chloroquine analogs which are able to prevent the activation of macrophages and inhibit the secretion of TNF\u2010\u03b1 from various cells at clinically relevant concentrations (Al\u2010Bari 2015) would confer some benefits in the treatment of viral infections. Another cytokine, interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3) has also been implicated in the pathologies of viral infections (e.g., Ebola). It has been reported that IFN\u2010\u03b3 increase cellular sensitivity to apoptosis by up\u2010regulating the expression of Fas and Fas ligand (Schroder et al. 2004), in fatal case of Ebola infection (Baize et al. 1999). IFN\u2010\u03b3 also takes a part of massive apoptosis by stimulating monocytes/macrophages which produce neopterin (Baize et al. 2002) and its concomitant derivative, 7\u20108\u2010dihydroneopterin (Murr et al. 2002). It has been shown that the plasma concentration of neopterin significantly and progressively increases throughout the disease course of Ebola infections (Baize et al. 2002). Therefore, therapeutic agents like chloroquine analogs, which inhibit various cytokine production (e.g., IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, neopterin) from various cells and also able to prevent the activation of macrophages (Baize et al. 2002; Al\u2010Bari 2015), these analogs may become a great therapy in the treatment of patients infected with emerging viruses.",

The analogs reduce systemic T\u2010cell activation (Murray et al. 2010; Leroux\u2010Roels et al. 2014; Routy et al. 2014) and immune hyperactivation in HIV/AIDS (Savarino and Shytaj 2015). Thus, the analogs are beneficial for chronic HIV\u2010infected individuals. As an endosomal inhibitor, chloroquine blocks Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) mediated activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) signaling by the decrease in levels of the downstream signaling molecules, interleukin\u20101 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK\u20104) and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF\u20107) and by the inhibition of IFN\u2010\u03b1 synthesis (Martinson et al. 2014). In addition to suppress pDC activation, the analogs also block the negative modulators of T\u2010cells such as indoleamine 2,3\u2010dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL\u20101). Since TLR stimulation and production of IFN\u2010\u03b1 by pDC contribute to immune activation, blocking the pathway using chloroquine analogs will interfere emerging viral pathogenesis (Martinson et al. 2014).",

Chloroquine also inhibits HIV\u20101 in post\u2010integrational event by affecting newly produced viral envelope glycoproteins. In vitro, chloroquine exerts an additive anti\u2010HIV\u20101 effect in combination with other anti\u2010retroviral agents (e.g. zidovudine, didanosine and hydroxyurea) without cellular toxicity or apoptosis (Boelaert et al. 2001a; Savarino et al. 2004). Since chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine appear to have a similar site of action (i.e. post\u2010transcriptional inhibition of gp120); these drugs can be useful in combination with other anti\u2010retroviral agents for the treatment for HIV\u20101 infected individuals in the developing world (Boelaert et al. 2001a; Savarino et al. 2001b; Naarding et al. 2007). As a HIV inhibitor, chloroquine alone inhibits HIV replication and viral particle glycosylation and synergizes the inhibitory effects with protease inhibitors such as indinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir (Savarino et al. 2004). Thus, it is suggested the use of chloroquine analogs in the management of routine HIV disease in vivo (Romanelli et al. 2004; Parris 2006; Naarding et al. 2007). HIV\u20101 transmission and replication on CD4+ T\u2010lymphocytes are reduced in presence of chloroquine, suggesting that the analogs exert anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity through a number of mechanisms in vivo including modulations of the gp120 structure (Naarding et al. 2007). As an inhibitor of route of entry, chloroquine vaginal gel formulation also exerts anti\u2010HIV\u20101 activity in vitro (Brouwers et al. 2008). pDC cells recognize microbial products and viruses via TLR7 or TLR9, and produce IFNs. The presence of elevated IFN\u2010\u03b1 level in HIV infected cells leads to contribute the immune activation. Chloroquine blocks TLR\u2010mediated activation of pDC and MyD88 signaling by decrease in the levels of the downstream signaling molecules IRAK\u20104 and IRF\u20107 and by inhibition of IFN\u2010\u03b1 synthesis (Ewald et al. 2008; Martinson et al. 2014). Chloroquine also decreases CD8+ T\u2010cell activation induced by HIV\u20101. These results suggest that chloroquine analogs have a preventive role in HIV pathogenesis by blocking TLR stimulation and IFN\u2010\u03b1 production pathway (Martinson et al. 2014). Interestingly, recently in order to find out, screen and evaluate other anti\u2010HIV compounds such as cell\u2010penetrating peptides or polyfunctional styryl thiazolopyrimidines, the analogs can be used as standard drugs for comparison purposes (Fatima et al. 2012; Mizuguchi et al. 2015).",

Chloroquine in combination with zidovudine and didanosine has a therapeutic potential for HIV\u20101 infected children (Engchanil et al. 2006). Increased level of activated T cells is a hallmark of chronic HIV infection and the treatment with chloroquine reduces systemic T\u2010cell immune activation, suggesting that its use might be beneficial of HIV\u2010infected individuals (Murray et al. 2010). Malaria and HIV co\u2010infection are coendemic in a wide portion of the world and remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality (Uneke and Ogbonna 2009; Kraft et al. 2015). The analogs offer significant advantages to current therapy due to lack of cross\u2010resistance with other antiretrovirals and low cost (Romanelli et al. 2004; Savarino et al. 2004). As chloroquine analogs inhibit HIV replication and glycosylation with limited toxicity in vitro as well as the antiviral effects of the analogs in combination with other antiretrovirals have been confirmed in vivo (Table 1), the analogs have been attempted to use in several ongoing clinical trials (Table 2). Recently, one of the review papers suggests the rational uses of chloroquine analogs counteract immune activation in HIV infection (Savarino and Shytaj 2015). However, another retrospective review confronts the statement of \u2018dampening of immune activation by the analog\u2019 (Chauhan and Tikoo 2015). Thus, if the analog\u2010based strategies pursue in future studies, some factors must be taken into considerations such as dose\u2010 and dosage form selection, starting time for treatment etc., in order to maximize the effectiveness of the analogs in vivo.",

These viruses display a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations which may vary from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal features (Dedania and Wu 2015). The dengue viral envelope glycoprotein E, and HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 play important roles for their attachments and entries into cells through two main pathways: direct fusion at the plasma membrane and receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis. The fusion process of these viruses is facilitated by low pH within the endosome (Peng et al. 2009; Matsuda et al. 2014; Piccini et al. 2015). Once exposed to acidic pH containing endosomal vesicles of the target cells, the viruses rearrange their structural conformational modifications of envelope glycoproteins (e.g., trimerization of dengue glycoprotein E) and finally initiate their replications (Ashfaq et al. 2011; Gandini et al. 2013; Vausselin et al. 2013; Bekerman and Einav 2015).",

Although there is no generally recommended specific antiviral therapy, the use of chloroquine, ribavirin and interferon\u2010alpha might be useful (Stock 2009). A milestone in the fortunes of chloroquine analogs is occurred since 1984 through an open pilot study on the efficacy of chloroquine in the treatment of chronic CHIKV arthritis and the observations indicated that antimalarial treatment improved significantly the articular index and morning stiffness in patients with CHIKV infection (about 50% patients improve their conditions) (Brighton 1984). This result leads to justify further studies of chloroquine in CHIKV infection. In vitro range, chloroquine analog shows a potential antiviral activity against CHIKV (Kaur and Chu 2013). Inhibitory effects are observed when chloroquine is administered preinfection, postinfection, and concurrent with infection, suggesting that chloroquine has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. Chloroquine diminishes CHIKV infection in a dose\u2010dependent manner (range of effective concentration, 5\u201320 \u03bcmol/L). The maximum inhibitory effect is observed within 1\u20133 h postinfection, and treatment is ineffective when the virus successfully passes through the acidification pathway in early stages of infection (Stock 2009; Kaur and Chu 2013). Thus, the starting time of treatment, doses and dose regimens of chloroquine are important considerations for successful treatments of CHIKV infections. In vivo, chloroquine is not or poorly active against acute CHIKV infections (De Lamballerie et al. 2008, 2009). This may be proper prognosis of the infection and the initial time of treatment, as well as dose regimens of chloroquine has not been established at yet.",

Moreover, there is a clear correlation between the EC50 of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of HA mediating the virus/cell fusion process. Thus, treatment should be started within time of virus/cell fusion process with exact effective concentration.",

In vitro, optimal NDV infection of the host cells is significantly affected by drugs such as chloroquine that inhibit endosomal acidification (Sanchez\u2010Felipe et al. 2013). NDV infection induces autophagy and inhibition of autophagy by the analog reduces the viral replication and infection (Meng et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2013).

The peplomers of Ebola viruses are composed of trimerized heterodimers of glycoproteins 1 and 2, which are heavily glycosylated with both N\u2010linked and O\u2010linked glycans (Geisbert et al. 2015). The glycoproteins of Ebola peplomers have broad tropism for a variety of host cells due to their ability to bind either specifically or non\u2010specifically to various cell surface molecules and facilitate the pH\u2010dependent endosomal entry to the host cells (Yang et al. 1998, 2000; Bhattacharyya et al. 2010). Thus, despite this broad tropism, infection by filoviruses greatly depends on acidic pH (Chandran et al. 2005; Marzi et al. 2012). Using in vitro cell culture assays, a systematic screening of FDA\u2010approved drugs for inhibitors of biological threat agents such as Ebola and Marburg viruses has been performed and found that chloroquine is the most noteworthy antiviral compound among the identified multiple virus\u2010specific inhibitors. In this report, it has been suggested that chloroquine disrupts viral entry and replication in vitro; protects mice against Ebola virus challenge in vivo (Madrid et al. 2013). Long 2015 (Long et al. 2015) confirmed that chloroquine is capable to inhibit viral entry in a pH specific manner and considered it as a priority candidate for treatment of Ebola viruses. Later on, reports suggested chloroquine inhibits the virus replication in vitro but is unable to treat in patient (Bishop 2014); mouse, hamster (Falzarano et al., 2015) and guinea pigs (Dowall et al. 2015).",

It has been reported that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS\u2010CoV infection and spread in vitro (Keyaerts et al. 2004; Vincent et al. 2005; De Wilde et al. 2014). In addition to the well\u2010known functions of chloroquine such as elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, ACE2. This may negatively affect the virus\u2010receptor binding and abrogate the infection. The IC50 of chloroquine for inhibition of SARS\u2010CoV in vitro (8.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcmol/L) is significantly lower than its cytostatic activity which approximates the plasma chloroquine concentrations reached during treatment of acute malaria. More interestingly, the suppressing effect is observed when the cells are treated with chloroquine either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage (Keyaerts et al. 2004; Vincent et al. 2005). There are screened a library of 348 FDA\u2010approved drugs for anti\u2010MERS\u2010CoV activity in cell culture and only four compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) have been identified to inhibit the viral replication (50% effective concentrations, EC50 3\u20138 \u03bcmol/L). Although the protective activity of chloroquine (alone or in combination) remains to be assessed in animal models, these findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with zoonotic coronaviruses like MERS\u2010CoV (De Wilde et al. 2014).",

Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a major causative agent of respiratory disease in cats. FCV infects cells via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis. Inhibitors of endosome acidification such as chloroquine block the viral permeabilization event in endosome (Stuart and Brown 2006). Treatment with chloroquine significantly reduces the replication of caliciviruses including porcine enteric calicivirus, murine norovirus\u20101 and feline calicivirus in vitro (Shivanna et al. 2014). Borna disease virus (BDV), mainly seen as the causative agent of borna disease in horses and other animals, exhibits high neurotropism and provides an important experimental model system for studying virus\u2010cell interactions within the central nervous system. Lysosomotropic agents including chloroquine prevent BDV infection, indicating that BDV enters host cells by endocytosis and requires an acidic intracellular compartment to allow membrane fusion and initiate infection (Gonzalez\u2010Dunia et al. 1998; Clemente and De La Torre 2009).",

Although there is a considerable intersubject variability in the steady state blood concentrations of chloroquine analogs, the maximum safe serum concentration of chloroquine diphosphate is 250\u2013280 ng/mL at maximum safe dose of 4 mg/kg per day (Laaksonen et al. 1974) and whole blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine is 1.0\u20132.6 \u03bcg/L (Munster et al. 2002). However, the doses and dose regimens should be adjusted to optimize the benefit/risk ratio on the rational basis of pharmacokinetics and pharmaco/toxicodynamics considerations. Moreover, the plasma levels of chloroquine analogs depend on some other factors such as methodology as well as storage conditions of samples because the analogs have been trapped in erythrocytes, lymphocytes and platelets. Chloroquine is also a racemic mixture. It has been reported that the kinetic behavior of separate enantiomers differs in humans (Augustijns et al. 1992). There is nothing to know about the relevance of stereospecificity in the therapy of emerging viral infections.For pharmacokinetic parameter considerations, chloroquine has been disputed for its narrow therapeutic indexes and poor penetration in specific tissues (Augustijns et al. 1992). It is reported that there are differences in efficacy and toxicity between chloroquine and its analog, hydroxychloroquine for long\u2010term effectiveness in rheumatoid diseases (Avina\u2010Zubieta et al. 1998). In rheumatoid arthritis therapy, it is reported that hydroxychloroquine is one half to two\u2010thirds as effective as chloroquine but one half in the toxicity (Tobin et al. 1982; Mackenzie 1983). Thus, hydroxychloroquine is generally regarded as a safe, reasonably effective and less toxic for the treatment of rheumatoid diseases, with a recommended daily dose of <6.4 mg/kg per day and a maximum dose of 400 mg/day. It is suggested that the blood concentration of desethylhydroxychloroquine, one of the oxidative metabolites of hydroxychloroquine is related to treatment efficacy, and that the blood hydroxychloroquine concentration is associated with toxicity (Munster et al. 2002). Thus, selection of chloroquine analogs or its metabolite is also an important factor for successful treatment of viral diseases. Chloroquine analog in combination with other antiviral drugs is considered for effective treatment of the viral diseases in order to avoid the interaction of P\u2010glycoprotein and multidrug\u2010resistance associated proteins of these viruses, which extrude drugs from the cells and other anatomic compartments (Savarino 2011). It is also noted that the combined drugs must not be interacted with the analogs (Zhou et al. 1995).The maximum inhibitory effect of chloroquine analogs is observed immediately started and treatment is ineffective when the virus successfully passes through the replication events (Stock 2009; Kaur and Chu 2013). It is also noted that the efficacy of chloroquine analog is markedly dependent on the acute stage and severity of infections (De Lamballerie et al. 2008). Thus, the starting time of treatment, doses and dose regimens (therapeutic loading dose and subsequent maintenance dose to achieve steady state blood chloroquine concentration) are important factors for efficacy in these viral infections.\n",
