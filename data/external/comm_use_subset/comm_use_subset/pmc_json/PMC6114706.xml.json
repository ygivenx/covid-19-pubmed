Due to rapid growth, low iron content in milk, and no access to soil, which is the main source of dietary iron for farm animals [2\u20134], housed lambs may develop anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia is well recognised, both in housed piglets [5\u20137] and in housed lambs [8\u201312]. Dietary deficiency in iron may lead to pica, i.e. ingestion of material other than normal food, including soil [13]. In Norway, anaemia is occasionally seen in connection with abnormal appetite and development of abomasal bloat in lambs [11, 14]. Pica in lambs on spring pasture, leading to ingestion of excessive amounts of soil, could potentially result in uptake of high numbers of Eimeria spp. oocysts as they can survive for at least 1 year in soil under Norwegian conditions [15].",

During summer, ewes and lambs normally graze on mountain, forest or otherwise uncultivated pastures, before the lambs are weaned in the autumn, at around 4\u20135 months of age [16]. Lambs become infected with Eimeria spp. either during the housed period or immediately after turnout [15]. Coccidiosis in sheep caused by Eimeria spp. leads to reduced welfare, increased mortality, and substantial production losses [18\u201320]. Clinical signs of coccidiosis include abdominal pain, anorexia, diarrhoea (\u00b1 haemorrhagic) and weight loss/reduced growth [21]. Control strategies include adequate nutrition, hygienic measures, and pasture rotation [22, 23]. However, prevention of outbreaks in Norway is largely based on chemoprophylaxis with anticoccidials, usually with toltrazuril treatment at turnout or about 1 week later [24, 25]. Resistance in poultry has been reported for several anticoccidials [26, 27]. In addition, toltrazuril resistance has been confirmed in a field isolate of Cystoisospora suis [28]. Widespread use of anticoccidials in Norway, combined with unverified reports of reduced anticoccidial efficacy in ovine Eimeria spp. [25, 29], accentuate the importance of alternative control strategies.",

Flocks were selected based on known clinical problems with coccidiosis (unpublished data), and proximity to the laboratory at Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), Sandnes, Norway. Twin pairs born within a period of 6 days were selected from each flock. The twins were randomly allocated (coin toss) to either iron supplementation (treated) or control groups. Treated lambs were injected with 600 mg gleptoferron (Gleptosil vet., Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale, France) subcutaneously in the inguinal fold, 0\u20133 days after birth. At the same time, the twin was injected with a corresponding volume (3 mL) of 9 mg/mL sterile NaCl (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany). Lambs were housed with their dam for 16\u201331 days before turnout, which was considered day 0. All included lambs were kept on slatted floors (plastic in flocks A, B, and E, and expanded metal in flocks C and F). In flock C, 18 lambs (9 treated and 9 controls) were kept for about 1 week on solid floors with wood shavings after injection. All five flocks used cultivated pastures for spring grazing, and all pastures had been grazed by lambs during the previous year. The farmers treated against helminths at around 3 weeks after turnout using either benzimidazole or ivermectin.",

However, unpublished data (Vatn, personal communication) indicated a significant reduction in Eimeria oocyst excretion three to 5 weeks after turnout that was associated with iron supplementation. These findings were not supported by the present study, in which iron supplementation of lambs did not reduce excretion of Eimeria oocysts 3 weeks after turnout. This may indicate that reduction of geophagia by iron supplementation is not an efficient way to reduce Eimeria oocyst uptake and excretion in lambs. Regardless of the reason for decreased oocyst excretion in the study by Vatn, a similar reduction in oocyst excretion did not occur in our study despite the larger number of animals and farms included. There was however, an apparent reduction in oocyst excretion in iron supplemented lambs 2 weeks after turnout. Although this was mostly non-significant, the potential that this may reflect a delay in uptake and excretion of Eimeria oocysts might suggest that development of immunity could be affected.

[8] administered 200 mg iron dextran intramuscularly within 24 h of birth, Vatn and Torsteinb\u00f8 [14] injected 300 mg iron dextran subcutaneously to lambs within 1 week of birth, and in our study we used 600 mg gleptoferron subcutaneously within the first 3 days of life. In addition, Pollmann et al. [42] showed that there was no difference in serum Fe concentrations, serum Fe-binding capacities, RBC, HGB or HCT between piglets supplemented with iron dextran, compared to piglets supplemented with gleptoferron. The dose employed might be of importance, as the need for iron is largely dependent on growth rates; i.e., rapidly growing animals require iron to maintain haematopoiesis during the 1st weeks of life [9, 43]. The dose used in our study, 600 mg gleptoferron, should be sufficient to cover the lambs\u2019 requirements. However, treated lambs showed significantly lower levels of iron, HGB and HCT at day 14, compared with their blood samples from day 0, indicating that their iron storage was low, and that higher or repeated doses of iron might have been beneficial. Should an increased or repeated iron dose be used, then the risk of reaching toxic levels must be evaluated. Clinical signs of acute iron toxicity in ruminants include anorexia, respiratory distress, icterus and central nervous signs [1, 44]. In our study, no signs related to iron toxicity were observed.",

In the present study, weight gain was not significantly affected by iron supplementation in any of the flocks when considering the growth period from birth to autumn. The difference in growth rates in the period from iron injection to 21 days post turnout (lamb age: 37\u201352 days) might be the result of iron supplementation, as control lambs in many cases showed blood values for iron below the reference level at turnout. However, although no significant differences were found, the control lambs grew better than the iron-supplemented lambs in four out of five flocks during the subsequent summer grazing period. This might be explained by the lambs\u2019 capacity for compensatory growth [48]. In addition, it is important to remember that lamb growth is dependent on several other factors, such as nutrition [49], mastitis in the dam [50], and gastrointestinal helminths [51].",

In one of the flocks (C), differences in blood parameters between treated and untreated lambs could not be demonstrated. The lambs from this flock were around 1.5 weeks older than lambs from the other flocks, and might have started ingesting solid feed, such as concentrates, prior to turnout. Additionally, these lambs had access to wood shavings during the indoor period, which may also have affected the blood parameters.",

These results indicate that iron supplementation of young lambs does not provide an appropriate alternative control strategy for prevention of coccidiosis.
