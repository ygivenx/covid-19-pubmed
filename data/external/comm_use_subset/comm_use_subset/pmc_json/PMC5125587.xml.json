            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is classified as a mosquito-borne arbovirus of the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus [1]. This virus was first isolated from a blood sample of a Rhesus monkey in Uganda in 1947 and, before its outbreak in Oceania in 2007, it was confined to Africa and Southeast Asia [1]. Since then, ZIKV has been circulating in the Americas, and in May 2015, the first case of ZIKV originating from the Americas was reported in Brazil. Thus far, ZIKV has expanded from South America to more than 28 countries and has aroused the attention of the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as that of many governments [2, 3]. Clinical presentation of ZIKV fever is non-specific; the most common symptoms are rash, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, asthenia, and conjunctivitis. ZIKV is thought to be transmitted to humans mainly by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The genome of ZIKV is a 10794-bp linear single strand of RNA that contains a large open-reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein, which can be spliced into capsid protein (C), pro-envelope protein (prM), envelop protein (E), and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins [4]. The ZIKV genome has been detected in the blood, saliva, urine, amniotic liquid, and tissue samples [5\u20137]. Although ZIKV infection is often asymptomatic, symptomatic infections have also been described, and these patients usually report mild symptoms [2]. Importantly, ZIKV infection in pregnant women may lead to the fetal malformation. Specifically, ZIKV has been linked with the occurrence of microcephaly in the babies [8]. Currently, there is no effective medicine or vaccine against this virus.",

The alternative synonymous codons do not occur equally; they instead follow a special codon usage pattern, a phenomenon termed codon usage bias [9]. Several factors are known to contribute to codon usage bias, such as mutational bias, translational and transcriptional selection, protein structure, tRNA abundance, RNA stability, GC content, gene expression level, and gene length [10\u201312]. The codon usage bias is regarded as a consequence of the balance between the mutation and translational selection [13]. Analysis of codon usage bias can provide useful insights into the molecular evolution of species and their genes.",

A possible explanation for this is that the low codon usage bias may be beneficial for the efficient transcription and translation of virus genes in host cells [22]. In addition, ZIKV shows the high CAI value (0.740) for H. sapiens, suggesting that natural selection from H. sapiens can affect the codon usage of ZIKV and the evolution of codon usage in ZIKV has made it to utilize the translation resource of H. sapiens more efficiently.

Interestingly, the role of the translational selection from H. sapiens in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV is different from that of its insect hosts (A. aegypti and A. albopictus). Compared with the codon usage pattern of A. aegypti or A. albopictus, the codon usage pattern of ZIKV is more similar to that of H. sapiens. This discrepancy of similarity in the degree of codon usage between ZIKV and its hosts may be caused by the various defense mechanisms from different hosts against ZIKV infection. Indeed, a recent study indicated that skin immune cells, including fibroblasts, epidermal keratinocytes, and immature dendritic cells, are highly permissive to ZIKV infection and replication, which can lead to the activation of an antiviral innate immune response [39]. Another study found that although A. aegypti and A. albopictus are susceptible to ZIKV infection, they are both low-competent vectors for ZIKV [40]. It is presumed that the evolution of the flavivirus genome sequence involved in anti-host countermeasures may be faster than that of other flavivirus sequence [41]. This may be one reason why the codon usage pattern of ZIKV tends to show more similarities to that of H. sapiens.",

Therefore, we determined the relative abundance of 16 dinucleotides in ZIKV polyprotein-coding regions. The results show that the occurrences of dinucleotides in ZIKV are not randomly distributed and no dinucleotide is present at the expected frequency (Table 3). Specially, the dinucleotides UG and CA are over-represented (\u03c1xy > 1.23) while UA and CG are markedly under-represented (\u03c1xy < 0.78). These data is consistent with previous study, which suggested that the dinucleotides UA and CG are under-represented in many sequence sets [21]. Moreover, the analysis of RSCU values of the eight codons containing CG (UCG, CCG, ACG, GCG, CGU, CGC, CGA, and CGC) suggests that these codons are not preferentially used. Meanwhile, in case of UA containing codons, most of codons are not preferentially selected, except for UAC. Taken together, the composition of dinucleotides plays a role in the synonymous codon usage pattern of ZIKV.",

This study found that Axis 1 has a significant role in shaping the ZIKV codon usage pattern and is significantly correlated with aromaticity and hydrophobicity indices, implying that the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of proteins are related to the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Aromaticity and hydrophobicity are known to play a role in peptide self-assembly and protein aggregation rates [55, 56]. A recent study showed that the structure of ZIKV particles is thermally stable, and this feature may help the virus to survive in the harsh conditions of semen, saliva, and urine [57].",

The resulting coordinate spots are separated into three groups, classified as group I, II, and III (Fig 7). Some strains isolated in Uganda clustered together with the strains isolated from Senegal, and were classified as group I. Additionally, some strains isolated from Central African Republic also clustered together with the strains isolated from Senegal, and these were classified as group II. Most of the strains isolated, regardless of their isolation countries, tended to cluster together and were classified as group III.
