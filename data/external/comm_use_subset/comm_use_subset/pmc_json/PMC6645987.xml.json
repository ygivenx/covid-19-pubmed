It is well established that viruses account for a significant proportion of emerging infections in humans and the majority are have a zoonotic origin, as highlighted by the recent Ebola epidemic in Africa and the repeated MERS CoV outbreaks in the Middle East. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern, as it causes an estimated 20 million human infections annually, with over three million symptomatic HEV cases and 56,600 deaths worldwide (Kamar et al., 2012). Mortality in immunocompromised patients and pregnant women can approach 25% for those infected with genotype 1 (Kamar et al., 2012). HEV infections are responsible for >50% of cases of acute viral hepatitis in endemic countries (Kamar et al., 2012). HEV is generally associated with a self-limiting hepatitis, as the infection clears within 3 months from onset of symptoms. Recently, it was observed that infection with HEV GT3 can become chronic in immunocompromised patients, such as organ transplant recipients or those infected with HIV (Galante et al., 2015).",

It has only one serotype and four genotypes (GTs), although a reclassification into seven GTs has been proposed (Smith et al., 2016). Of the four genotypes, GT1 and GT2 are able to sustain human-to-human transmission and sporadically cause large human outbreaks in endemic regions due to faecal contamination of the water supply. Genotypes 3 and 4 are typically zoonotic; infection can occur from eating undercooked pork or venison, via direct exposure to animal faeces, and sporadically through blood transfusion or liver transplantation (Berto et al., 2013; Christou & Kosmidou, 2013; Lu, Li, & Hagedorn, 2006; Renou et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2007; Sridhar, Lau, & Woo, 2015; Tedder et al., 2017). There is now evidence that HEV GTs 3 and 4 infections mainly originate in swine, and local zoonotic transmission of HEV has been recorded worldwide (Christou & Kosmidou, 2013).",

It has been shown that seroprevalence of HEV in human populations varies between 10% and 50% in blood donors, depending on the geographical location (Dalton et al., 2008; Scotto et al., 2012; Slot et al., 2013; Vollmer et al., 2012). Furthermore, it is possible that the majority of patients with unexplained and undiagnosed hepatitis may be HEV positive as HEV is generally not considered as a potential cause especially in developing countries, due to the lack of diagnostic tests (Kamar et al., 2012; da Silva et al., 2012). The seroprevalence of HEV in pigs in various European countries varies between 12.5% and 80% (Berto et al., 2012; Mccreary et al., 2008), and antibodies against HEV have also been detected in several other species worldwide, such as rabbit, rats, cattle, sheep, goats, chickens and dogs (Drexler et al., 2012; Johne et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2004).",

From each farm up to 15 individual animals were sampled. As this study was a part of the WT-VIZIONS project, which aimed to assess the circulation of many different pathogens in addition to HEV, the number of animals to sample from each species was a function of the relative number of animals of each species present on the farm. For the above reason, a scoring system was developed to assign different weight to each species and calculate the number of individuals to sample. Therefore, for each farm between 1 and 15, pigs were randomly sampled depending on the total number of different animals species present on the farm (Carrique-Mas et al., 2015; Rabaa et al., 2015). The total number of pigs for each farm was not recorded. The age of the pigs varied between 6 weeks and 4 years, but the precise age of the individual sampled pig was not recorded, although the majority of the animals were adult pigs. In all farms, samples of a minimum of 1 g of faeces were collected aseptically in a sterile plastic container and resuspended in 1 ml of viral transport medium (VTM); rectal swabs were placed in tubes containing 1 ml of VTM. The collected samples were maintained at 4\u00b0C (max. 24 hr), subsequently transported to OUCRU and frozen at \u221220\u00b0C until processing.",

In each collection, a minimum of 50 samples were required from each of the age bands 0\u201319, 20\u201339 and 40+. For the subsample used in this study, 1,726 samples were selected.

We report an observed prevalence of HEV RNA in pigs in southern Vietnam that is similar to countries in Europe and Asia (Liu et al., 2015). The HEV prevalence observed in pig rectal swab samples was 8.2%, which is lower in comparison with previous studies, but the sensitivity of PCR screening is considerably lower using rectal swabs than faecal samples. We additionally found that all sequences obtained from pig samples were HEV GT3. Despite all samples being collected in the same province, these data show that HEV sequences clustered into three distinct clades within GT3, and the clusters were not associated with the farm or year of collection. Further, although the sequences clustered with HEV GT3, they did not cluster with previously known subgenotypes. These data confirm the substantial genetic variability that exists within the various HEV genotypes (Cao, Dianjun, & Meng, 2012).",

The same type of comparison is performed in other epidemiological studies where blood donors, for logistic reasons (e.g., easier recruitment), are recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias. As our study assessed the HEV seroprevalence in the hospital-attending population, it is important to highlight this distinction because some socioeconomic or occupational groups may have more reason to attend a hospital than others. Thus, these samples may represent individuals that have higher disease risk or vulnerability, to HEV or to infections in general, and hence may not be representative of the population at large. In particular, children in this sample are likely to be more vulnerable than children in a true general-population sample. The observed low seroprevalence in young children from the farmer cohort is in agreement with previous published data from endemic and non-endemic countries, such as Nepal, Bangladesh and France (Izopet et al., 2015), contrary to what was observed in the same age group in the hospital population sample in Dong Thap.",

In particular, despite HEV GT3 being a zoonotic infection, a higher seroprevalence was not found in adult farmers than in other adults. This suggests that additional HEV risk factors need to be identified and evaluated. Confounders associated with the high HEV seroprevalence detected in both farmers and the hospital-attending population may be due to other risk factors rather than just direct contact with pigs. One potential risk factor might be consumption of internal pig organs, which is common in Vietnam. Other risk factors associated with high seroprevalence in human may be due to household flooding, drinking contaminated water or poor household hygiene. Future population-based studies, using random controls chosen by geographic area, should be performed to confirm or contradict these results. Farmers do not have a higher HEV seroprevalence than adults in the DTPH sample; however if they did, the relative risk of zoonotic HEV genotypes (i.e., GT3 or GT4) would be impossible to estimate using this seroprevalence assay.",

We did not find evidence to support this hypothesis. However, our study had certain limitations; first no viral characterisation was performed in the two human cohorts, as no individuals presented with symptoms of liver diseases or jaundice during the study. Therefore, we could not link human HEV genotypes to pig HEV genotypes; only presence of anti-HEV IgG was measured, and direct evidence of HEV zoonotic infection was not identified. Furthermore, it was not possible to determine the genotype of HEV exposure in humans because HEV has only one serotype, and the ELISA cannot distinguish the different GTs. Our farm-based individuals work and live in close contact with pigs, and Dong Thap is a semi-rural region with a high density of pig farms; therefore, we speculate that the majority of the individual anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals have been exposed to HEV GT3 rather than other HEV genotypes (only HEV GT3 was identified in the pigs in our sample).",
