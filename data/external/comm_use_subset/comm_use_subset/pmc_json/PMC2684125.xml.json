We observed that stepwise genetic distance was greatest immediately following initial infection and diminished to a plateau then after (Fig. 1). Recognizing that this change in substitution rate would violate a molecular clock assumption and could cause pairwise genetic distances to yield inaccurate evolutionary divergence estimates (especially if genetic distance calculations were performed with respect to a reference sequence representing an hypothetical common ancestor), we quantified the extent to which failing to account for dynamic SARS-CoV evolution might affect estimating an origin time.",

We used this gamma function (\u03b1 = 1, \u03b8 = 4, implemented using the function Gamma Distribution[1, 4] + 0.18 in Mathematica (Wolfram Research Inc, 1988)) in the computer simulation program to evolve sequences according to the phylogenetic tree, which was rooted by using as outgroups sequences obtained from strains found in civet cats (He et al. 2004). Comparable results were obtained using one- and two-parameter molecular substitution models (Jukes and Cantor, 1969; Kimura, 1980). Reassortment was unconsidered. The computer simulation program calculated Hamming distances between an hypothetical ancestor and the sequences; paired time points with these distances according to the phylogenetic tree; performed linear regressions; and extrapolated backward to 0 distance, to estimate origin times. We ran 1000 replicates and determined the median and 95% confidence interval for the resulting distribution (Fig. 2), which allowed us to estimate a representative index case date.",

The points represent nucleotide substitution rates r among 51 SARS-CoV sequences obtained between November 2002 and March 2003, inferred on the basis of a recently published phylogenetic tree (He et al. 2004). The upper and lower points at t = 0 represent r (civet sequence SZ16, human sequence GZ02) and r (human sequence GZ02, human sequence GD01), respectively. The curve is a gamma distribution function that is similar to the gamma distribution function that was used in computer simulations. t = time (days since estimated initial transmission from civets to humans); r = sequence divergence rate (substitutions per site per evolutionary step).",
