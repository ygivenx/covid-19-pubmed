It has been estimated that among its 14.9 million inhabitants, each year more than 900,000 pneumonia episodes occur in children under 5 years of age, leading to almost 8,000 deaths annually [7]. A previous descriptive study reported that pneumonia was the most frequent cause of admission, representing 18% of total hospital admissions [8]. However, detailed information was not available on clinical presentation and on the etiology of suspected pneumonia cases [8]. Moreover, no control group was included. The presence of a control group of children without pneumonia would allow better interpretation of microbiological findings, particularly with nasal sampling [9]. In March 2011, Mali included pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) in a routine immunization program; but vaccine coverage is still low [10].",

In a Western Kenya case-control study, S. pneumoniae, RSV, and influenza A virus were the predominant causes of pneumonia in children [16]. We noted almost similar results in Mali.

The clinical significance of microbial detection by PCR is problematic at the individual level because most detected pathogens are not causes of pneumonia. However, number of pathogens is predictive of the risk of pneumonia, suggesting that simple quantification of species detected would permit the evaluation of pneumonia risk. At the population level, nasal samples are interesting because the prevalence of carriage in the controls is considered.",

The results should serve to better manage pneumonia not only in these children but also in those from neighboring countries. Data quality was enhanced by centralized microbiological analysis in the Emerging Pathogens Laboratory (Lyon, France). In addition, this analysis should serve to better focus multicentric pneumonia studies that will permit us to assess the global etiologies of pneumonia and to compare etiologic agents between countries and continents.",

Then, at the individual level, it is difficult to establish if a positive nasal swab denotes etiology or nasopharyngeal colonization; particularly for bacterial agents such as S. pneumoniae because of the high asymptomatic carriage. However, at the population level, addition of a control group permits to evaluate and control for the prevalence of carriage in asymptomatic children. In a pneumonia etiology study, it would be interesting to correlate the threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from RT-PCR with lower airway specimens to establish more precisely the relationship between positive nasal swab and etiology of pneumonia, according to the microorganism [30]. Second, because the study was implemented in one hospital in Mali, external validity might be limited. However, Gabriel Tour\u00e9 University Hospital is a reference center in the country, and then source population is not limited to the city of Bamako. Third, study power was confined to detecting some linkages (i.e. serotypes associated with the risk of pneumonia).",
