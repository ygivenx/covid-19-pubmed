In the second approach, A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1, and cells were fixed at 5 and 16 h p.i. followed by immunofluorescence (Figures 2c\u2013e). As shown in the Figure 2b, NP of IAV colocalizes with API5 in the nucleus. Similar observations were also made in cells infected with PR8 strain of IAV (Figures 2d and e). It is interesting to note that API5 is a nuclear protein containing an NLS at its C terminus.30 Further, strong evidence suggests that API5 is a negative regulator of apoptosis induced by E2F1 (a nuclear protein).31 In light of these reports, nuclear colocalization of API5 with NP of IAV raises an interesting possibility that NP exploits E2F1-mediated apoptotic pathway via its interaction with API5.",

Influenza virus is known to induce apoptosis during later stages of infection in order to facilitate effective viral propagation and dissemination.34 Concurrent with these findings, we observed a time-dependent increase in APAF1 protein levels, cleaved forms of both caspases 9 and 3 in infected cells (Figure 4a), indicative of progressive apoptosis. PARP cleavage was used as a marker of caspase activity. In addition, the relative levels of APAF1 mRNA were elevated significantly (~2-fold) in infected cells (Figure 4b). Interestingly, overexpression of NP in A549 cells mirrored the effect of IAV infection on cellular apoptosis. As observed during IAV infection, NP overexpression (pcDNA3.1-myc/His-NP) too was marked by elevated levels of cleaved caspases and PARP, underscoring role of NP in IAV-induced apoptosis (Figure 4c). Importantly, APAF1 mRNA levels were also increased (Figure 4d) indicating involvement of E2F1-dependent apoptosis in IAV infection via cross talk with API5.",

As shown in Figure 6a, siRNA-mediated knockdown of API5 expression facilitated increased recruitment of E2F1 to APAF1 promoter. By contrast, enforced expression of API5 in infected cells led to abrogation of E2F1 occupancy on APAF1 promoter (Figure 6b). On the basis of these observations, we conclude that API5, in order to obstruct the proapoptotic pathway, interferes with recruitment of E2F1 transcription factor to target gene promoters such as APAF1. Hence, it is of paramount importance for IAV to direct downregulation of this antiapoptotic factor, in order to ensure successful viral infection and spread.",

First, cells were transfected with either control, NP (NP-myc) alone, API5 (API5-Flag) alone or both constructs. Second, cells transfected with either control or API5 (API5-Flag) expression construct followed by infection with PR8 strain. In both cases cells were subjected to analysis for apoptosis using annexin V (an early apoptotic marker) and 7AAD (a late apoptotic marker) staining. As evident in Figures 7a and b, NP of IAV possesses a proapoptotic function, which is in agreement with previous reports.21 NP induces ~2-fold increase in 7AAD positive and ~2.5-fold increase in annexin V positive cells, when compared with control. Interestingly, API5 overexpression mitigates the proapoptotic effect of NP and significantly decreases the percentage of annexin V and 7AAD stained cells. Further substantiating these observations, cells stained positive for annexin V and 7AAD under conditions of IAV infection decreased markedly upon overexpression of API5 (Figures 7c and d). In all, these observations clearly demonstrate that NP and IAV induce apoptosis in cells, which is significantly attenuated by overexpression of API5.",

Further, our results also indicate that suppression of API5 by NP is instrumental in ensuring IAV-induced apoptosis. In this regard it is worthy to note that IAV-mediated apoptosis of infected cells favors viral replication and propagation.36, 37 Considering that API5 plays a critical role in IAV-induced apoptosis, it was imperative for us to evaluate the significance of API5 in IAV replication. For this purpose, we quantified the levels of NP mRNA in IAV-infected cells under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression. Upon knockdown of API5 expression in A549-infected cells there was a significant upregulation of relative mRNA levels of NP when compared with control (Figure 8b). Conversely, enforced expression of API5 led to the downregulation of relative mRNA levels of NP (Figure 8f). In addition, NP protein levels were in agreement with mRNA levels under conditions of API5 depletion and overexpression in infected cells (Figures 8a and e). Importantly, API5 depletion in infected cells led to ~5-fold increase in the viral titers as determined by plaque assay when compared with control (Figure 8c). Conversely, API5 overexpression severely attenuated viral titers (~6-folds) (Figure 8g). These results were further confirmed using a replicase assay, wherein A549 cells were treated with either non-targeting siRNA or API5-specific siRNA followed by co-transfection with plasmids encoding PR8 polymerase complex genes PB2, PB1, PA, and NP in conjunction with a reporter plasmid containing the UTR of the NS1 segment upstream of the luciferase gene driven by the human RNA pol I promoter. Strengthening our previous observations, replicase assay results showed sixfold elevation in replicase activity upon depletion of API5 (Figure 8d). Upregulation of NP mRNA, protein levels, polymerase activity as well as viral titers in API5-depleted cells are clear indicators that viral replication is inhibited by the host factor API5. NP interacts and downregulates API5 to relieve suppression of the E2F1\u2013APAF1 apoptotic pathway.",

However in the later stage of the IAV life cycle, it disables antiapoptotic pathways for efficient viral replication and dissemination. IAV proteins such as PB1F2, HA, M1, M2, and recently NP have been demonstrated to participate in IAV-induced apoptosis.15, 18, 19, 20, 21 The virus does so by hijacking various pathways and functions of host-cellular proteins. Several cellular signaling pathways hijacked by the virus have been studied, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K)/Akt pathway, MAPKinase pathway or the protein kinase C (PKC)/protein kinase R (PKR) signaling, and NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB pathway. The Akt signaling pathway has been associated with both viral replication and host survival.11, 12, 43",

Importantly, the interaction is conserved in H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes, underlining its relevance in IAV pathogenicity (Figures 1a and b). It is worth noting that API5 and NP interact primarily in the nucleus (Figures 2b and d) and incidentally the nuclear localization of API5 is known to be instrumental for its control of E2F1-dependent activation of proapoptotic gene APAF1.30, 31 Thus, we expected nuclear localization of NP and API5 to have a bearing on APAF1 transcriptional status. Indeed, NP induced APAF1 transcription, which was further facilitated by API5 depletion, whereas it was remarkably dampened by API5 overexpression (Figures 5b and c). Importantly, silencing of API5 expression led to E2F1 enrichment on APAF1 promoter in infected cells (Figure 6). Hence, we propose that interaction of API5 with NP of IAV sequesters it, rendering it unable to oppose E2F1-dependent transactivation of proapoptotic genes. Not surprisingly, proteins encoded by other viruses such as EBNA3C protein encoded by Epstein barr virus and Hepatitis B virus X antigen (HBx) encoded by hepatitis B virus have been previously reported to regulate E2F1-mediated apoptosis in favor of virus.44, 45 Previous reports have shown that IAV sequesters host antiapoptotic protein bcl2 through its phosphorylation by activating cellular p38MAPK, facilitating viral-induced apoptosis.46",

Importantly, our data suggest that API5 overexpression antagonizes this function of IAV by abrogating E2F1 recruitment to the APAF1 promoter (ChIP assays, Figure 6), thus preventing its transactivation. There is documented evidence which indicates that caspase 3 activation during the onset of apoptosis is a crucial event for efficient influenza virus propagation.36 In agreement with this report, we show that IAV infection and NP expression induce activation of caspases 9 and 3 (Figure 4). API5 knockdown facilitated activation of caspases in IAV microenvironment, highlighting the negative role of API5 in IAV-induced apoptosis (Figure 5). Essentially, API5 downregulates APAF1 and prevents activation of caspases, thus impeding apoptosome formation under infection conditions. Further, IAV employs NP to interact with and sequester API5 along with transcriptionally suppressing it, thus ensuring uninterrupted activation of the apoptotic pathway. Hence, taking all our current observations in view, it appears that different proteins encoded by IAV, such as NP and M1, utilize multiple mechanisms to target strategic host proteins involved in regulation of the cellular apoptotic network for instance Hsp70, clusterin, Bax, and now API5.",

In agreement with previously reported role of NP in IAV-induced apoptosis, 7AAD, and annexin V staining results indicated higher number of apoptotic cells upon NP overexpression (Figure 7). Interestingly, ectopic expression of API5 either alone or with NP led to a significant reduction in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, reinforcing the notion that API5 opposes the apoptosis-inducing function of NP. Apoptosis is critical for viral replication and dissemination,48 which is also the case with influenza virus replication as overexpression of antiapoptotic factor API5 led to a decrease in viral transcription, which was concurrent with decrease in viral protein levels (Figure 8). Consistently, API5 depletion increased viral polymerase activity and viral titers, further confirming that expression of antiapoptotic protein API5 is detrimental for viral replication and propagation (Figure 8).",
