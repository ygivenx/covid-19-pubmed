This mosquito-borne flavivirus causes a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in humans, which include an acute self-limited flu-like illness known as dengue fever (DF). DF is characterized by headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain and sometimes maculopapular rash. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe illness documented by haemoconcentration (haematocrit increase by 20%) and evidence of plasma leakage such as pleural effusion and ascites as the major pathophysiological features. In some patients, DHF may progress to hypovolemic shock (Dengue Shock Syndrome, DSS) with circulatory failure [2,6-8].",

Based on serological analysis, DENV can be differentiated as four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4), each one with the capacity to infect and cause even the more severe manifestation, although some serotypes have been isolated more frequently in DHF epidemics. On the other hand, evolution studies and molecular epidemiology using nucleotide sequences from the DENV genome have demonstrated the occurrence of genotype clades within each serotype [9-28]. For this reason, genetic characterization of DENV has become a critical issue for understanding epidemic patterns of viral spread. At the same time, the important role of DENV itself in disease severity has also been proposed rather than the immune enhancement developed after subsequent infection with heterologous serotypes [1,7,29]. The increase in virus transmission over the last 50 years has possibly increased its adaptive potential. In addition, host factors such as the age, race, presence of non-neutralazing cross-reactive antibodies and possibly chronic diseases could act as selective pressures, resulting in more virulent genotypes that may be associated with DHF/DSS [9,17,29-34].",

Moreover, since the first case of DHF in Colombia at the end of 1989, these two serotypes have been associated with severe disease. To date, DENV-1 falls into five clades designated as genotype I (Southeast Asia, China and East Africa), genotype II (Thailand), genotype III (Malaysia), genotype IV (South Pacific) and genotype V(America, Africa). Additionally, the existence of lineages with distinctive geographical and temporal relationships had been suggested [12,20,26,28,35-38]. Due to the importance of DENV in public health, the particular goals of this research were to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of DENV-1 and to date the phylogenetic tree using isolation time as calibration points to establish date of introduction of virus and rate evolution patterns of virus in Colombia.",

BEAST allowed the use of isolation year as calibrating point to estimate divergence time and then generated a posterior probability (PP) distribution of trees instead of a bootstrap value [41-44]. The resulting tree clearly placed the genotypes of DENV-1 already circulating globally before the first appearance of this serotype in the Americas between 1970 and 1980 (figure 3). According to the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) beneath the strict clock model, the estimated root for this phylogeny was 1929 and the substitution rate was 8.58 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions per site, per year. To increase resolution, we use the strict molecular clock model to reconstruct Colombian isolates (figure 4). Under the assumption of a constant substitution rate, the estimated root indicates 1945 as the date of the more recent common ancestor. In addition, there was a split up around 1987 between DENV-1/CO/188_Guaviare/1987 isolates and the remaining strains (PP = 0,82). As the time goes by, we can see a sustained increase in number of isolates and a rapid spread of viruses, which included few changes among them as seen with the branch lengths. By the year 1992 (approximately), another remarkable partition event occurred to generate 2 well defined clades (PP = 0,77 and 1), evolving independently since the early 90's until recent time.",

            "text": "The huge genetic diversity of DENV has been vastly documented, starting perhaps with the Rico-Hesse proposal of different \"genotypes\" comprising serotypes 1 and 2 [10], following by several studies and genotype definition of DENV-3 and DENV-4. In this way, five different genotypes has been previously defined for DENV-1 (genotypes I to V) suggesting a significant genetic variation. In fact, various lineages had been proposed based on time-spatial clustering and clade distribution [26,28,35-38]. In the present study, 74 Colombian DENV-1 sequences were analyzed to try to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the virus in this country. Different genome regions have been used to infer DENV phylogeny including those with short fragments [10,27,28]. Here we employed a sequence from the carboxi terminal of the envelope (E) protein which has demonstrated to provide a useful phylogenetic signal to define genotype clustering [26]. It is important to note that the better resolution of evolutionary patterns should be obtained from complete genomes. However, it was not possible to obtain largest fragments from the oldest isolates, probably because of RNA degradation across the time. As expected, all strains were clustered with those from Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and different Caribbean Islands, corresponding to the formerly named genotype V (America/Africa), showing a well supported clade clearly separated from the others genotypes. Colombian strains DENV-1/CO/261_Atlantico/1978, DENV-1/CO/263_Choco/1979 and DENV-1/CO/150_Choco/1979, were separated from the remaining isolates and appeared closer to those from the Caribbean islands, which represent the entrance of serotype 1 into the Americas. It was reported for the first time in 1977 in Jamaica and rapidly spreading to the Antilles including Cuba, Antigua & Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Cura\u00e7ao, Dominica, Grenada, Guadaloupe, Guyana, Haiti, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, St. Kitts, St. Martin, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad, Turks and Caicos, and the Virgin Islands [5]. In 1978, DENV-1 was implicated in large mainland outbreaks perhaps occurring at the same time in Colombia, Venezuela, Surinam, French Guyana, and eventually Centro America and Mexico. In Colombia, DENV-1 was isolated between 1977 and 1978, so the strain DENV-1/CO/261_Atlantico/1978 represents perhaps the first virus entrance to the country. It rapidly spread until the next isolation in Choco (DENV-1/CO/263_Choco/1979 and DENV-1/CO/150_Choco/1979) and then it fades away (or at less it was not reported) probably displaced by DENV-2 (maintaining DENV-1 in a silent low circulation) until 1985 when it established in different localities. It is important to note that even with the mobility between countries and increasing opportunity of viral introduction, only one DENV-1 genotype is circulating in America, different to DENV-2 and DENV-3 of which at least 2 genotypes has been detected (America/Asia genotypes and I/III genotypes respectively) suggesting perhaps, dissimilar patterns of viral spread and transmission between DENV genotypes and even different adaptation capacity.",

In our study, a remarkable cladogenesis event occurs around 1992 according to the molecular clock, generating two well supported clades corresponding to putative Colombian DENV-1 lineages. Despite the eco-epidemiology similarities between Colombia and neighbor countries were dengue is a major concern, lineages have not been previously demonstrated for DENV-1. In fact, according to ML phylogeny, most of the American strains (Argentina and Brazil) correspond to the lineage-1, leaving the lineage 2 restricted to Colombia.

            "text": "Despite the emergence and rapid diversification of DENV has been a matter of special concern, precise mechanisms of evolution remain unclear [45-50]. It is a fact that human RNA viruses including Influenza, HIV, Coronavirus, etc., have particularly increased mutation and evolution rates mostly because of the lack of proofreading activity of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase [51,52]. Nevertheless, arthropod-borne viruses (Arboviruses) have demonstrated slower mutation rates comparing with those infecting directly human host, probably because of the trade-off effect occurring when the virus is obligated to adapt alternatively into the invertebrate vector and vertebrate host [51]. This resulting constrain has been experimentally assessed in vivo to Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis [52] and in vitro to DENV [51] demonstrating that fitness improves when virus specialize in a single cell line but decreases in virus undergoing alternative passages in different cells. In view of that, over all DENV mutation rates have been previously inferred, ranging from 4.55 \u00d7 10-4 (DENV-1) to 9.01 \u00d7 10-4 (DENV-3) [19]. In the present study, we found a mutation rate of 8.58 \u00d7 10-4 substitutions per site, per year, suggesting faster evolution rates for Colombian strains, perhaps because of the high transmition occurrence especially in hyperendemic areas, where virus replicates in several human hosts, reducing the constraining effect occurred in the vector. However, this high mutation rate does not necessarily reflect a fitness advantage or a successful adaptation process. Actually, positive selection for DENV seems to be serotype/genotype dependent and even more, protein specific. In fact, envelope (E) protein apparently exhibits some adaptation evidence in DENV-3, DENV-4 and various DENV-2 genotypes, but not for DENV-1, strongly suggesting a purifying selection pressure, at least over this gene. Nevertheless, further studies have to be done to try to understand the adaptation process in DENV.",

Thus, establishment of Asian colonies increased visitors and perhaps favored the entrance of viral strains.

Nevertheless, two different lineages have been evolving fast since the earliest 90's according to molecular clock.

Briefly, 140 \u03bcl of each supernatant was placed into 560 \u03bcl of AVL buffer with 5.6 \u03bcl of carrier RNA and mixed with ethanol (96-100%) before passed through a column by centrifugation. After washing with buffers AW1 and AW2 RNA was finally eluted with 60 \u03bcl of AVE buffer and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Five microliters from each RNA extraction were used as template in a one step RT-PCR reaction (Qiagen, One-Step RT-PCR kit) as previously described [55]. Primers used [DEN1S1871 (5'-TGGCTGAGACCCARCATGGNAC-3') and DEN1AS2622 (5'-CAATTCATTTGATATTTGYTTCCAC-3')] were designated to amplify 751 bp from de joining region E/NS1. Reactions were evaluated in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidum bromide and reactions observed as negative were then subjected to nested PCR as follow: 1 \u03bcl of initial RT-PCR product, 1 \u00d7 buffer B (60 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 15 mM (NH4)2SO4), 40 pmol of each primer [DEN1S2133 (5'-GGAAAATGTTYGAAGCAACYGCCC-3'), DEN1AS2553 (5'-TCCTCCCATGCCTTCCCRATGG-3')] and 2.5 U of Taq DNA Polimerase (Invotrogene) in a final volume of 50 \u03bcl. PCR reactions were first denaturated at 94\u00b0C (2 minutes) and then subjected to 40 cycles of denaturation (94\u00b0C, 30 seconds), primer annealing (57\u00b0C, 4 minutes), primer extension (72\u00b0C, 30 seconds) and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. Nested PCR was evaluated in 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.",

We analyze the data using the year of isolation as calibration points to estimate divergence time in years. In order to avoid duplicates, sequences identical to other on the dataset were removed. Rate variation among branches was inferred under the strict molecular clock model, whereas substitution rate among sites was calculated with the General Time-Reversible model (GTR) combined with the gamma parameter and proportion of invariant sites (GTR+\u0393+I ) model. MCMC was run for 10,000,000 steps and sampled every 500 steps and the 10,000 first steps of each run were discarded. BEAST format files were obtained in the provided BEAUti graphical interface and the generated trees were visualized with the FigTree 1.2.2. program.
