Incidents of human salmonellosis in Europe (EU) are relatively common (EU notification rate of 23.4 cases per 100,000) and most are attributed to the consumption of contaminated foods (55%) but fairly high percentages are linked to environmental sources (13%) and even to direct animal contact (9%) [2].

The RMBD results disclosed the presence of Salmonella spp. DNA by real-time PCR and the isolation of Salmonella spp., that was serotyped as Salmonella Typhimurium Group B 1,4,(5),12:i:1,2, whereas C. perfringens was counted as <10 colony forming units (cfu)/g.

In this report, the culture results of RMBD, the clinical signs of the two cats, the detection of Salmonella spp. DNA in cat number 2 and the exclusion of other potential aetiological agents (with the exception of C. perfringens toxin A gene detection) suggest this is a case of salmonellosis.",

            "text": "In relation to the C. perfringens toxin A gene detected in the faeces of case number 2, C. perfringens biotype A is the most common genotype in dogs and cats and part of the normal canine intestinal microflora [7]. Its role as an enteropathogen is not fully understood and it is suspected to be associated with anything from mild, self-limiting diarrhoea to rapidly fatal necrohaemorrhagic enteritis. Most studies indicate this as a primary enteropathogen but some authors suggest it could act as an opportunistic agent in dogs and cats [20]. Disruption of the normal microbiota, such as a sudden change to a high protein diet, or enteric infection by other pathogens, like parvovirus, are considered predisposing factors in dogs [11, 21]. Diagnosis of C. perfringens type A associated diarrhoea in companion animals is challenging because the clinical signs cannot be differentiated from enteritis caused by other enteropathogens. Recent studies correlating the presence of cpe in feces with diarrhoea in dogs suggest that the detection of this toxin in stool samples could be useful to diagnose C. perfringens type A-associated diarrhoea. However, no study has confirmed the role of the C. perfringens enterotoxin in dogs and both enterotoxin and isolates positive for the cpe gene can be found in healthy dogs, so these methods could suggest that C. perfringens is involved, but they are not confirmatory [20]. Similar observations are reported to explain the results from the IDEEX available for case no. 2. The notes linked to cpa and cpe laboratory results highlight that the presence of the DNA of the C. perfringens alpha toxin over 300,000 copies/g could be implicated in the clinical signs but, in case of cpe copies under the limit or absent, as in our case, it is unlikely that cpa is the cause of diarrhoea and definitely not cpe. All these aspects led us to speculate that a co-infection was responsible. It is important to note that unlike studies in dogs, no association has been found between diarrhoea and detection of the enterotoxin in stool samples or detection of cpe in C. perfringens strains isolated from cats. Hence, the diagnosis should be based only on the isolation of C. perfringens (positive or negative for cpe) in conjunction with the absence of other enteropathogens [20].",

However, no cultural examinations were performed in faeces of the two cats to avoid isolates from animals and feed being characterized by a discriminative typing method, therefore representing a major limitation of our findings. Considering that the sources of Salmonella exposure are dependent on whether cats are indoor or outdoor pets [17] and that both cats were households pets with no contact with other animals or the outside environment, the most likely source of exposure is consumption of food contaminated with Salmonella. In this context, veterinary practitioners should be trained and encouraged on the need for faecal culture in case of positive PCR findings in order to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in companion animals [7].",

Several Salmonella-related recalls of raw foods have been reported in recent years, including frozen cat food in the USA [1], in contrast with the decreased Salmonella prevalence in dry feeds [24]. Raw food is well-known to pose a substantial risk of infectious disease to the pet, the pet\u2019s environment and the humans in the household, but there are no data on the number of dogs and cats that have become ill after eating contaminated food, or the percentage of pet owners who feed commercial or prepared RMBDs [18].
