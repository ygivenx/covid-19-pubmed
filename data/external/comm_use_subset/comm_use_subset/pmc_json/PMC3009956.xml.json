However, safety considerations may limit vaccination of humans with live organisms. Development of peptide-based vaccines created with epitopes which elicit IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8+ T cells[16] is a promising strategy to mobilize the immune system against T. gondii in humans[16-20].

Then, bioinformatic algorithms to identify HLA-A03 supertype bound peptides were utilized to find additional, novel T. gondii-derived, potential CD8+ T cell eliciting epitopes restricted by the HLA-A03 supertype. We screened peptides from tachyzoite, bradyzoite and sporozoite proteins (GRA10, GRA15, SAG2C, SAG2D, SAG2X, SAG3, SRS9, BSR4, SPA, MIC) of the type II T. gondii strain, ME49, searching for those with high binding scores in a bioinformatic analysis (IC50 < 50 nM) and then in binding assays. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seropositive and seronegative persons were tested for response to these peptides using an IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay. These latter studies were performed to attempt to identify other peptides that would be promising candidates for inclusion in a multi-epitope, next generation immunosense vaccine. Then, information obtained from testing the first three peptides studied was used to guide formulation and administration of a peptide pool. This pool included the first three peptides identified earlier and tested in the initial experiments combined with the newly identified peptides that elicited IFN-\u03b3 from human HLA-A03 supertype restricted CD8+ T cells. All the peptides in this pool were tested with a universal T helper epitope called PADRE and a new, promising adjuvant called GLA-SE with Pam2Cys in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. Capacity to induce IFN-\u03b3 production by spleen CD8+ T cells, and to protect against parasite burden following subsequent challenge were determined. For parasite challenge, a luciferase transfected Type II Prugneaud parasite was administered, followed by luciferin administration and imaging with a Xenogen camera system a week later. This allows detection and quantization of bioluminescent parasites as a biomarker to assess efficacy of immunizations in protection.",

Mice were inoculated three times at intervals of two weeks. Eleven to fourteen days post immunization, spleen cells were isolated and exposed to each individual peptide. A peptide was considered immunogenic if it induced IFN-\u03b3 spot formation that was significantly higher in the immunization group compared with the group inoculated with PBS. After the immunizations, only KS9 and AM9 were found to be immunogenic in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice, and only when the iniversal CD4+ helper T cell peptide epitope PADRE was included. Robust responses were observed when GLA-SE was added in the vaccine. Greater responses were elicited when Pam2Cys was used as an adjuvant for some peptides but did not enhance responses to all of them, and in fact reduced the effect of some peptides. Figure 4 shows the representative data of IFN-\u03b3 spot formation from the four immunization groups which were stimulated by individual peptides.",

As a next generation vaccine that might be even more robust, elicit CD8+T cells that would be effective against all three life cycle stages and Type I and II genetic types of the parasite, we sought to identify additional HLA-A11 epitopes to be used for vaccine development. In order to identify additional peptides from T. gondii that were present in tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites of Type II strains for HLA-A03 supertype restricted CD8+ T cells, we screened candidate peptides from tachyzoite, bradyzoite and sporozoite proteins (GRA15, GRA10, SAG2C, SAG2X, SAG3, SRS9, SPA and MIC) of the Type II T. gondii strain (Tables 1 and 2). For parsimony in numbers of peptides utilized, we attempted to include peptides present in Type I as well as Type II parasite genetic types. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from seropositive T. gondii donors were tested for response to these peptides by using the IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assay. Pooled peptides were tested initially. Pools 2 and 5 were significantly different (p < 0.05) from the control (data not shown). Then the individual peptides were tested (Figure 6). Three out of 34 epitopes elicited responses greater than 50 IFN-\u03b3 SFC from seropositive donors PBMC, but not from seronegative donors PBMC (Figure 6). These peptides and the proteins from which they are derived are: STFWPCLLR (SAG2C13-21); SSAYVFSVK (SPA250-258); and AVVSLLRLLK (SPA89-98) adding proteins expressed in sporozoites and bradyzoites to the peptides selected. All peptides identified herein then were found to show high binding affinity to three to five HLA-A03 supertype alleles in the MHC-peptide binding assay (Table 3). The numbers in Table 3 which indicate high binding affinity are those less than 500 IC50 nM. They are indicated by bolded font numbers in Table 3.",

Lipopeptides hold several advantages over other conventional vaccine formulations; for instance, they are self-adjuvanting and display none of the toxicity-associated side effects of other Th1-inducing adjuvant systems. In our work, transgenic mice that were immunized with three short lipopeptide vaccines had T cells that produced IFN-\u03b3. Among them the lipopeptide vaccine formulated with KS9 or AM9 stimulated higher IFN-\u03b3 production than the lipopeptide vaccine formulated with RS9. Unexplained and variable responses have been observed to high affinity binding peptides in other models, e.g., studies of Livingstone, Alexander, Sette et al with Lassa fever virus. It will be of interest to better understand possible mechanisms for such lack of response in future studies. However, the lipopeptides with three epitope peptides linked together with alanine spacers did not stimulate an IFN-\u03b3 response by splenocytes from immunized mice when the splenocytes subsequently were exposed to each of the peptides in vitro. The reason why the lipopeptides with the three linked peptides did not work well in the transgenic mice might be related to a frame shift caused by the linkers that altered the response to the original peptides rather than the alanines functioning for the intended purpose of introducing a cleavage motif. The three linker \"AAA'' between the peptides had previously been demonstrated in other systems to result in sensitization to each linked peptide. However, surprisingly, it did not appear to work well herein.",

            "text": "Adjuvanting antigens contributes to the success of vaccination. An example herein is that 3-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A(GLA-SE), a detoxified derivative of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Salmonella minnesota R595 was a potent adjuvant. This GLA-SE is a novel adjuvant which was formulated in an emulsion[21-24]. This is a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist that is a potent activator of Th1 responses [21-24]. It has been used as an adjuvant in human vaccine trials for several infectious disease and malignancy indications. It has been very effective as an adjuvant providing CD4+ T cell help for immunizations against other protozoan infections such as leishmaniasis [21-24]. In our study, a robust response was observed when GLA-SE was included in preparation for immunization of mice. Pam2Cys (S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]cysteine) is a lipid component of macrophage-activating lipopeptide. Pam2Cys binds to and activates dendritic cells by engagement of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)[24]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) function as pattern-recognition receptors in mammals[36]. We have found that both TLR2 and TLR4 receptors participate in human host defense against T. gondii infection through their activation by GPIs and GIPLs(Melo, Hargrave, Miller, Blackwell, Gazinelli, McLeod et al, in preparation, 2010). TLR2 and TLR4 likely work together with other MyD88-dependent receptors, including other TLRs, to elicit an effective host response against T. gondii infection[36]. In our study, there was a slightly more robust response observed when Pam2Cys was co-administered for some peptides, but not all of them.",

Robust protection was achieved in the HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice challenged with Type II parasites following immunizations. In order to identify additional peptides from T. gondii that were present in tachyzoites or bradyzoites[37,38] or sporozoites of Type I and II strains and elicited IFN-\u03b3 from HLA-A03+ supertype (which includes the HLA*1011 allele) restricted CD8+ T cells, bioinformatic algorithms were utilized to identify novel, T. gondii-derived, epitopes restricted by the HLA-A03 supertype. Then PBMC cells were tested to determine whether the peptides elicited IFN-\u03b3 from human CD8+ T cells from seropositive persons. This was intended to collectively provide broad coverage for the human population with HLA-A03 supertype worldwide. The additional peptides we identified as immunogenic for human peripheral blood cells were also robust in eliciting IFN-\u03b3 from splenocytes of HLA-A*1101 mice and protection when used to immunize these mice. These findings will facilitate development of an immunosense epitope-based vaccine for human use.",
