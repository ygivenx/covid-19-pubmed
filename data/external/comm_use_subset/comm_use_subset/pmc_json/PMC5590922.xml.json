Since the goals of healthcare services are always multiple, conflicting, intangible, and complex, it is difficult and intractable to set up an overall measurement of performance. Regarding the multiple inputs and outputs, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been recognized as an effective nonparametric model to assess the relative efficiencies of a set of decision-making units (DMUs) [3]. Particularly, in recent decades, DEA has been widely applied to improve the productivity of healthcare-related fields in many countries [4\u20137], such as the United States [8], Japan [9], China [10] and India [11]. As discussed in [12], DEA is more suitable for managerial decision-making, which makes it the best choice to evaluate the efficiencies of HKHA hospitals.",

An ideal scenario with the highest efficiency is producing the most outputs (e.g. the number of treated patients) using the least inputs (e.g. healthcare expenditure); and such inputs and outputs are called desirable factors. However, the maximum quantities of desirable outputs are usually bounded, given the limited desirable inputs. The reception of the patients beyond the hospital capacity will generate a congestion problem, even resulting in some unexpected mortality. A high patient mortality rate not only reflects a poor medical quality, but also may cause a dispute. Thus, the mortality rate of patient, as an undesirable output, is expected to be lower. The measurement of hospital efficiency might be biased if the undesirable factors are ignored.",

            "text": "In order to integrate undesirable factors into modeling, one straightforward idea is applying inversion transformation on the value of undesirable factors [13]. However, the transformed values are usually negative, making it difficult for DEA modeling. To circumvent this difficulty, one solution is adding a constant to the transformed undesirable factors to keep them positive [14\u201316]. However, the determination of this constant has a significant impact on DMU ranking and classification. Another widely used transformation is the reciprocal transformation [17\u201319], but the computation complexity of this nonlinear transformation is much higher. F\u00e4re and Grosskopf [20, 21] propose an alternative approach which handles the undesirable factors by using a directional distance function. However, the form of direction vector could affect the DMU ranking. Thus, it is a critical issue to design an appropriate transformation function. In some cases, an improper transformation may generate the inverse result as it is expected. To avoid the transformation problem and preserve the original data, Liu and Sharp [22] treat the undesirable inputs as desirable outputs and vice versa, based on the physical relationship between the input and output. It has been proved as an effective approach which considers computing the operational efficiency by maximizing the undesirable inputs and desirable outputs and minimizing the desirable inputs and undesirable outputs, simultaneously. This idea is further extended by [23], where a unified model with several different DEA approaches dealing with undesirable inputs or outputs is proposed. Besides, it is suggested that the weighted additive model [24] can be applied to handle the problem with undesirable inputs or outputs. In [25], a slacks-based measure (SBM) is proposed, in which the unit invariant, monotone, and reference-set dependent properties are analyzed in details. The proposed SBM model outperforms CCR, BCC and Russell model in efficiency evaluation, where both the slacks for the input and the output are calculated. In [26], a more generalized slacks-based DEA model with undesirable factors considering preference is proposed, which combines the advantages of all the factors stated above and makes several DEA models unified. The proposed method also outperforms some state-of-the-art DEA models on different databases of real applications.",

However, it is shown in Table 7 that there are only 55% hospitals have higher efficiency values than the average, 0.870, which reveals the fact that there exists unfair resource allocation, inefficient resource utilization and poor management in HKHA. For example, Pok Oi Hospital has relatively lower efficiency in the earlier years, because it had no ED service before 2010. Queen Mary Hospital is regarded as one of the best hospitals in HK, but it faces the over-investment problem which lowers the efficiency value.",

We observe that from 2000 to 2013, all the productivities of hospitals have made significant improvement. There are two major reasons: (i) SARS outbreak and (ii) Health services fees\u2019 reformation. The first diagnosed patient with SARS was on 21 February 2003 and the disease had widely spread in HK within just two weeks. The peak of the epidemic started from 24 March 2003, and there was a rapid influx of infected residents in HA hospitals, particularly the United Christian Hospital which was soon overwhelmed. Therefore, its productivity improves by 17.87%, particularly, the TEC and FS improve by 4.77% and 13.76%, respectively (see Table 11). On 29 March 2003, the Government and HA decided to designate the Princess Margret Hospital, due to its specialty in treating infectious disease, to receive SARS patients after diverting all its existing patients to other hospitals. Thus, its FS only improves by 1.81%. However, since the government intensified a strong technical support to the Princess Margret Hospital for resisting SARS, its TEC improves by 9.87% during 2000-2003 (see Table 11). Besides, the speed of the patient flow increase was unexpected. The additional manpower from other hospitals was deployed to Princess Margret Hospital for help, which is to reduce the medical resources input equivalently for the other hospitals. With the contribution from other hospitals to share the workload, the designation of Princess Margret Hospital officially ended on 11 April 2003. Furthermore, with the assistance of the necessary operational and information technology systems, a revised public hospital fees structure was implemented at the beginning of 2003 together with an enhanced waiver mechanism to better provide the available public resources to those in need. Along with the soaring SARS attendances, there is improvement in TEC for almost all the hospitals.",

In conclusion, the geography factor has no significant influence on HA hospital efficiency.",

An ideal scenario with the highest efficiency in a healthcare setting would be treating the most patients using the least healthcare expenditure. However, the reception of the patients beyond the hospital capacity will generate a congestion problem, even resulting in some unexpected mortality, where a high patient mortality rate not only reflects a poor medical quality, but also may cause a dispute. Thus, it is regarded as an UO and is expected to be as low as possible. On the other hand, the in-patient discharge rate is a powerful indicator to represent whether this hospital could provide a good quality of service, which is expected to be as high as possible, as an UI. Moreover, the measurement of hospital efficiency might be biased if the undesirable factors are ignored.",

Then, through the Tobit regression model, some exogenous factors\u2019 influences are tested. The empirical results show that the HKHA hospital efficiencies of each hospital and cluster are significant different. In general, the healthcare efficiency of hospitals belonging to the KEC and NTWC are significantly higher than the other hospitals, which has a close correlation with demographic composition, geographic condition and economic position. By analyzing the evaluation of productivity change over time, we observed that the SARS outbreak has a strong impact on the hospital efficiency. In addition, we found an interesting phenomenon that the public hospital serving in a richer district with high population density has a relatively lower efficiency, as HK people with better economic condition prefer to accept higher quality service from the private hospital.",

One critical consequence of these problems is low healthcare efficiency of hospitals, leading to low satisfaction among patients. In conclusion, we provide two suggestions on how to improve the HKHA hospital efficiency in the future: (i) according to the original resource allocation system, the HKHA policy makers need to properly increase the input for the inefficient hospitals with IRS, such as Tung Wah Eastern Hospital and save some investment for the inefficient hospitals with DRS, such as Tung Wah Eastern Hospital Prince of Wales Hospital. (ii) It is necessary to change the medical investment standard. It may be better to consider patient attendance and hospital current efficiency simultaneously. Such a new system can solve the problem of unfair resource allocation effectively.",

Thus, we will also attempt to investigate the simulation methods for resource optimization by integrating heterogeneous factors at individual level in our future works.",
