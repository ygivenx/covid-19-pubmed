The presence of natural viral co-infection at baseline was detected in 9.6% of samples. We first assessed the associations between baseline nasal microbiota composition, natural viral co-infection (i.e. before pneumococcal inoculation and vaccination) and pneumococcal carriage outcome. We detected a significant association between baseline nasal microbiota composition and consecutive pneumococcal carriage outcome. This effect was stronger for carriage3 outcome, that is, when volunteers were stratified in high-dense, low-dense and non-carriers based on both conventional culture and qPCR data (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), R2 = 3.1%, p = 0.048; Fig. 2, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), compared to carriage2 outcome, where volunteers were dichotomized in carriers or non-carriers based on culturing only (Supplementary Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3A). The importance of semi-quantitative information on pneumococcal density in these analyses was further supported by a borderline significant association between baseline microbiota composition and density of pneumococcal colonization at day 2 (R2 = 1.7%, p = 0.076; Supplementary Table 3B). Interestingly, volunteers who became low-dense carriers demonstrated the lowest presence of natural respiratory viruses at baseline (before intervention) and showed the lowest rate of (replicating) influenza virus following LAIV vaccination compared to both high-dense and non-carriers (Supplementary Table 4). These associations were independent (Supplementary Table 4E). We thus studied the potential interaction between viral co-infection, microbiota composition and pneumococcal carriage3 outcome; we observed that the association between baseline microbiota and pneumococcal carriage acquisition was dependent on viral co-infection at baseline, but not on LAIV vaccination (p = 0.011 and p = 0.640, respectively; Table 1). Stratified analysis suggests, however, that the association between microbiota and carriage3 outcome was slightly weaker for the LAIV cohort compared to the control cohort (R2 = 2.9 vs. R2 = 4.2%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 3B and 3C), suggesting interactions between both natural viral co-infection and iatrogenic LAIV infection, and (1) baseline nasal microbiota and (2) pneumococcal carriage receptiveness.",

We found 18 clusters of microbiota profiles, of which 8 clusters comprised of \u226510 samples, representing in total 418/451 samples (Supplementary Fig. 4). We identified the OTUs that discriminated most between clusters using a random forest algorithm (referred to as biomarker species; Supplementary Fig. 5A). The largest cluster (STA; n = 132 [31.6%]) was characterized by Staphylococcus spp., followed by a cluster typified by several Corynebacterium (of which the most abundant was Corynebacterium\n[3]) and Dolosigranulum spp. (CDG; n = 104 [24.9%]), and a separate Corynebacterium (1) cluster (COR; n = 102 [24.4%]). The other five rarer clusters, characterized by Haemophilus spp. (HPH; n = 20 [4.8%]), Peptoniphilus, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia spp. and Streptococcus salivarius (PEP/MIX; n = 17 [4.1%]), Moraxella spp. (MOR; n = 17 [4.1%]), Fusobacterium (FUS; n = 14 [3.3%]) and Streptococcus spp. (STR; n = 12 [2.9%]), each comprised <5% of samples (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 5B and Supplementary Table 5). In line with previous findings, the cluster distribution at baseline was significantly different between low-dense and non-carriers (Fisher\u2019s exact test with Monte Carlo simulation; p = 0.039). Baseline differences were related to a higher proportion of CDG profiles in low-dense carriers vs. non-carriers (37.0 vs. 10.8%, respectively, p = 0.042). Contrariwise, although non-significant, low-dense carriers specifically lacked STA-dominated profiles compared to both non-carriers (18.5 vs. 43.2%, respectively, p = 0.058) and high-dense carriers (39.5%, p = 0.111). These results were confirmed by a stratified analysis where clustering was based on baseline samples only, ruling out potential confounding of these associations by profiles that emerge post-challenge.",

Intriguingly, the OTUs that were most strongly related to the first two axes of both CCA and dbRDA were mostly oral-type species, including Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and other previously identified acquisition-associated microbiota members, including Dolosigranulum\n(4) and Corynebacterium (3) (dbRDA).

Cytokine levels at day 0 were significantly lower in volunteers who became low-dense carriers compared to non-carriers, although this was only significant in the LAIV but not in the control group upon stratification (GM-CSF, interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2 and IL-4, within LAIV; linear model, p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 8A). In general, volunteers who became high-dense carriers had intermediate cytokine levels at baseline. Following we combined baseline microbiota plus cytokine data to study whether the combined data improved the classification strength of carriage3 outcome. Indeed, combining these data showed larger data separation than microbiota data alone (Fig. 4), suggesting that both baseline microbiota composition and baseline host responses are driving pneumococcal receptiveness.",

This finding was in line with previous observations by our group, demonstrating that pneumococcal exposure not followed by colonization was still associated with augmented anti-protein immunoglobulin responses, suggesting induction of host immune pathways25. Apart from a difference in Dolosigranulum and Corynebacterium spp. in non-carriers compared to high-dense carriers, these phenotypes were very alike, which suggests that in both cases the physiological balance between microbiota and immune surveillance is perturbed, presumably contributing to a self-enforcing dysbiosis-inflammation cycle26. This feedback loop acknowledges the bidirectionality of the links between immune response and microbiota, which likely explains our observations in both high-dense carriers and non-carriers. The unimodal, rather than linear relationship between microbiota composition and carriage receptiveness has not been identified before, since we previously had no access to samples obtained before pneumococcal inoculation.

For this manuscript, we therefore decided to test two carriage outcome variables on the basis of nasal washes from days 2, 7 and 9: (1) carriage2 outcome (based on pneumococcal detection using conventional culture only), carriers, with a culture-positive sample at any point and non-carriers, who were culture-negative at all times; and (2) carriage3 outcome (combination of pneumococcal detection using both conventional culture and molecular techniques), coded as high-dense carriers (culture-positive at any point), low-dense carriers (qPCR-positive and culture-negative) and non-carriers (qPCR- and culture-negative at every point). Initial explorative analyses demonstrated higher explanatory power of carriage3 outcome, that is, the variable incorporating qPCR results.

In conjunction, we assessed the association between microbiota composition and month (i.e. seasonal effects), the presence of virus(es) at baseline and the interaction between LAIV or presence of viruses at baseline and carriage outcome. The relationships between microbiota composition and carriage outcome were visualized using NMDS plots. Differentially abundant OTUs at baseline associated with pneumococcal carriage3 outcome were detected using several statistical techniques, including (1) ANCOM45 and (2) metagenomeSeq46. Differences in \u03b1-diversity according to carriage3 outcome were tested using (1) Wilcoxon\u2019s rank-sum tests and (2) linear mixed-effects models with carriage outcome, time point and the interaction between carriage outcome and time points as fixed effects and subject as random effect. We used the multcomp package to determine significant differences within specific contrasts. To assess the microbiota dynamics related to carriage3 outcome over time, we performed an unsupervised average linkage hierarchical clustering based on the Bray\u2013Curtis dissimilarity matrix. The optimal number of clusters and biomarkers for each cluster were determined as previously described7. Comparisons of cytokine levels according to carriage3 outcome was performed using a linear model, including vaccine, carriage outcome and the interaction between vaccine and carriage outcome. We simultaneously assessed the associations between baseline nasal microbiota and day 0 cytokine levels using CCA and dbRDA.",

Clusters were characterized by Staphylococcus (2; STA); Corynebacterium\n(3) and Dolosigranulum (4; CDG); Corynebacterium (1; COR); Haemophilus (9; HPH), Moraxella (6; MOR), Fusobacterium (10; FUS), Streptococcus (7; STR), and Peptoniphilus\n(5), Finegoldia\n(8), Anaerococcus\n(11) and Streptococcus salivarius (13; PEP/MIX).

The height of the figures corresponds with the total number of samples within that group. In addition, the height of the nodes and the thickness of the edges connecting the nodes is proportional to the number of samples. The number of samples in each cluster at each time point, stratified by carriage3 outcome, is provided in Supplementary Table 5. The number of cluster changes was lower in low-dense carriers compared to both high-dense and non-carriers (see Tables 2 and 3).

Using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (a) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) (b), we assessed the links between cytokine levels day 0 and baseline nasal microbiota. It is assumed that the dependent variables (log10 + 1-transformed relative abundance operational taxonomic units [OTUs]) respond in a unimodal or linear fashion to the predictor variables (log2-transformed cytokine levels) for CCA and dbRDA, respectively. We simultaneously plotted the samples (data points, n = 71), significant (p < 0.05) predictor variables (cytokines; arrows) and the OTUs that were most strongly associated with the first two axes (n = 10 for each axis, excluding overlapping OTUs). Samples were coloured according to carriage3 outcome (red, high-dense carriers, n = 36; blue, non-carriers, n = 18 and orange, low-dense carriers, n = 17), ellipses denote the standard deviation of the samples in each group. Note that carriage3 outcome was not accounted for when simultaneously modelling cytokine/microbiota data, yet still are clearly discriminated, suggesting that baseline microbiota and cytokine levels at day 0 (following live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and prior to pneumococcal challenge) are related to pneumococcal receptiveness. Data separation by carriage3 outcome was higher when ordination was based on both microbiota and cytokine data (dbRDA and CCA; standardized absolute \u03b2-coefficient 0.43 and 0.32, respectively) compared to microbiota alone (non-metric multidimensional scaling [NMDS]; 0.22; Fig. 2). This was also true when coefficients were split between X- or Y-coordinates.
