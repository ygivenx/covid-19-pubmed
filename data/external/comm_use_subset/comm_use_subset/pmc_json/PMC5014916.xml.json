Globally, as of 16 May 2016, the WHO has been notified of 1,733 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 628 related deaths, in 27 different countries (http://www.who.int/csr/don/16-may-2016-mers-saudi-arabia/en/). While gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and queasiness, are also occasionally observed (3, 4), MERS-CoV causes mainly respiratory diseases.",

Following infection, there is translation of two large replicative polyproteins, pp1a (the ORF1a polyprotein) and pp1ab (the polyprotein made from ORF1a and ORF1b through a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift during translation). These polyproteins are processed by the virus-encoded papain-like proteinase (PLpro) and nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). This auto-proteolysis leads to the formation of 16 nonstructural proteins, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and a nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) and helicase that are known as nsp12 and nsp13, respectively (3, 6\u20138). These are likely to form the core of membrane-bound replication-transcription complexes in double-membrane vesicles at perinuclear regions (9).",

Helicases are known to unwind nucleic acids during replication, recombination, and DNA repair (14), and recent reports have shown that they are also involved in other biological processes, including displacement of proteins from nucleic acid, movement of Holliday junctions, chromatin remodeling, catalysis of nucleic acid conformational changes (18\u201323), and several aspects of RNA metabolism (transcription, mRNA splicing, mRNA export, translation, RNA stability) and mitochondrial gene expression (9). A more recent biochemical study revealed a dual function of human enterovirus nonstructural protein 2CATPase as both an RNA helicase and an ATP-independent RNA chaperone which may destabilize RNA duplexes and assist in the formation of more globally stable RNA structures (24). Defects in helicase function have been associated with some human diseases, including Bloom\u2019s syndrome, Werner\u2019s syndrome, and xeroderma pigmentosum (25\u201328).",

We assessed the unwinding activity of M-nsp13 with the various 5\u2032-RNA partially duplex substrates with different overhang lengths in the presence of various ATP concentrations from 0.25 to 5 mM. Using the Michaelis-Menten equation, the unwinding activities under different ATP concentrations were plotted as the fraction of the released RNA from the total RNA helix substrate at each ATP concentration. The results showed that increasing ATP concentrations up to ~2 mM ATP apparently enhanced the helix unwinding of each RNA substrate (Fig. 7A), after which no significant difference in substrate unwinding was noticeable. Moreover, M-nsp13 could not completely unwind the 5\u2032-RNA-0 (blunt substrate), 5\u2032-RNA-2 (2-nt overhang), and 5\u2032-RNA-5 (5-nt overhang) partially duplex RNA substrates even at 5 mM ATP.

The longer the length of the loading strand, the lower the amount of ATP required for optimal unwinding. As noted in Fig. 6B, M-nsp13 was able to partially unwind the substrate with the longest 5\u2032 loading strand without inclusion of ATP in the reaction mixture. A recently characterized human enterovirus helicase, nonstructural protein 2CATPase, was shown to possess an ATP-independent RNA chaperone activity (24). The RNA chaperone activity was observed along the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 direction in the absence of ATP. Given the presence of an ssRNA product in the absence of ATP, when M-nsp13 was incubated with the 5\u2032-RNA-20 partially duplex RNA substrate, we wanted to confirm a possible RNA chaperone activity by M-nsp13. As shown in Fig. 6C, M-nsp13_K288A (the control protein that lacks the ability to hydrolyze ATP) did not unwind either substrate, thereby ruling out an RNA chaperone activity by M-nsp13. The small amount of the ssRNA product observed with the 5\u2032-RNA-20 partially duplex RNA substrate in the absence of ATP may be due to residual cellular ATP purified with the helicase as well as the longer overhang length of 5\u2032-RNA-20 substrate relative to other substrates that enhances M-nsp13 unwinding activity.",

The 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 helicase activity of M-nsp13 may be similar to what was previously proposed for SARS-CoV (31). It was suggested that SARS-CoV nsp12 and nsp13 may work together to carry out one of the replication complex functions, i.e., synthesis of subgenomic transcripts containing the leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome (29, 30). To achieve this, nsp12 would have to transcribe RNA in a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 template direction, followed by pausing at transcription regulatory element sites. Such pauses may activate motion in the opposite direction, allowing nsp13 (aided by nsp12 and possibly other viral and host proteins) to unwind the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA primer and facilitate transfer to the complementary region of the 5\u2032 leader genomic sequence.",

Other RNA virus helicase-associated NTPase activities were also shown to lack any noticeable specificity for specific nucleotides (30, 35, 39\u201341). This may suggest that the lack of selectivity for specific nucleotide cofactors is a general feature of RNA virus helicases. Due to the high nucleotide consumption necessary for maximum viral RNA synthesis in the host cell, it may be beneficial for the helicase\u2019s duplex-unwinding activity not to depend strictly on a specific nucleotide. As such, there is lower risk for depletion of cellular NTP pools.",
