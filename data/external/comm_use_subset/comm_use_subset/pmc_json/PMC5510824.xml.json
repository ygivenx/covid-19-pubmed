All these techniques have a low sensitivity or can detect only a limited number of viruses. Sensitivity and the time required to obtain a result have been improved by the recent development of molecular tests, which can also detect viruses that were previously undetected, such as coronaviruses NL63, HKU1 and bocaviruses. The use of such tests has also demonstrated that the carriage of respiratory viruses is very rare in adults (2.1%) [6].",

However, such tests are expensive and not yet taken into account by regulations or guidelines, so they are widely used. Nevertheless, their use has already improved descriptions of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in various high-risk populations, such as neonates and preterm infants [11,12], children [13,14], immunocompromised patients [15], and the elderly [16]. For the general adult population, recent studies have shown that viral pathogens can be detected in 53% of patients attending the emergency department with acute respiratory symptoms [17], and in 23 to 28% of those with community-acquired pneumonia [18,19]. In the ICU, respiratory viruses are detected in 30 to 36% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia, and are associated with high mortality rates [20\u201323]. However, the studies published to date were subject to several limitations, as they were based on different methods for detecting respiratory viruses, and were performed in specific populations, often only during the winter.",

These changes in the tests used over time were made to decrease the time to results. None of these tests could differentiate between rhinovirus and enterovirus. These two types of virus were therefore grouped together as \u201cpicornavirus\u201d (rhinovirus + enterovirus) for the purposes of this analysis. The Respifinder\u00ae 19 and FilmArray\u2122 tests, accounting for 26.4% of all the tests included in the analysis, cannot detect bocaviruses. The various tests used have been reported to have similar performances [8,9,24], as confirmed by our internal comparisons and method validations.

We refer to this period as the \u201cwinter period\u201d here. The frequency of positive tests for viruses was higher during the winter period than during the summer period (33.3 vs. 22.2%, p<0.0001), and, as expected, the distribution of viruses differed between these two periods (Fig 2, p<0.0001). The distribution of influenza followed the typical seasonal pattern observed in Europe, with active circulation from January to March. RSV, coronavirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus were also more frequently detected in the winter, with a period of circulation extending from November to May. Two groups of viruses circulated throughout the year: picornavirus and parainfluenza virus. Together, these two groups accounted for 78.6% of all viruses detected during the summer period and picornaviruses constituted the second most frequent group of viruses during the winter (26.1%), after influenza (34.4%). Adenovirus had a more complex seasonal pattern over the years covered by this study. It was very rare in adults during 2011 and 2014, circulated throughout the year in 2012 and caused an epidemic exclusively during the winter in 2013.",

We also found differences between children and adults, as also reported by other groups, especially for influenza [26]. Interest in respiratory viruses present in adult populations is also increasing. However, many previous studies have focused exclusively on the winter period or influenza detection and may have underestimated the potential role of other respiratory viruses. A Canadian study performed with Canada's national hospitalization database showed that influenza and other respiratory viruses are associated with morbidity requiring hospitalization, in both children and adult populations [27]. Other studies have also described the high frequency of non-influenza viruses in adults hospitalized in China [17,28], Spain [29] and France [18]. However, due to differences in populations, age groups, climate conditions, sampling or laboratory methods, the incidence and seasonality of respiratory viruses may differ slightly between countries and studies.

In our study, 29.2% of the 7196 samples tested were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Nasopharyngeal samples, collected mostly during the winter period, had a positivity rate of 32.0%. This is slightly lower than reported in previous clinical studies based on mPCR testing of nasopharyngeal samples, in which positivity rates ranged from 40 to 45% [30\u201332]. This difference can be explained by the use of a strict case definition linked to the prospective aspects of these studies, whereas our study was retrospective and may be more representative of the real conditions in our hospital units. The lower respiratory tract was sampled at a constant frequency throughout the year and its positivity rate was non-negligible, at 26.2%. This finding is consistent with those of previous studies on pneumonia cases admitted to ICUs, in which positivity rates ranged from 16% to 36.4% [20,21,33]. Interestingly, the main viral group identified in the LRT samples was also the most neglected: the picornavirus group.

It is commonly thought that picornaviruses, which cause most \u201ccommon colds\u201d, are associated only rarely, if ever, with severe pneumonia, and that the detection of viruses from this group in cases of severe pneumonia must reflect asymptomatic carriage. However, despite the frequent detection of picornaviruses in asymptomatic children [34,35], recent studies have shown that the asymptomatic carriage of respiratory viruses, including picornaviruses, is rare in asymptomatic adults [6,19]. It has also been suggested that the viruses of this group are better adapted for URT infection than for LRT infection, as they replicate in vitro more effectively at 33\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C [36]. However, experimental picornavirus infections are not restricted to the URT and are also detected in the LRT [37]. They may also be associated with increases in the number of the bacteria classically associated with secondary infections in the bacterial microbiota, accounting for the predisposition to bacterial otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia conferred by picornavirus [38]. Picornaviruses are known to be associated with asthma exacerbation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and they have also been implicated directly in the development of asthma [39]. Some previous studies have revealed an association between specific subtypes of picornaviruses and greater pathogenicity in immunocompromised patients [40,41]. More importantly, picornaviruses are increasingly being associated with both community- and hospital-acquired severe pneumonia [20\u201323,42]. In these studies, viral pneumonia was frequently found to be associated with picornaviruses and to display non-negligible pathogenicity or a complicated clinical course in co-infections involving both bacteria and viruses. The huge predominance of picornaviruses in the LRT observed in our study also highlights the potential role of these viruses in severe pneumonia.",

Indeed, despite the objective of 75% vaccination rates in at-risk populations in France, only 60.2% of these populations in 2009 and 48.9% in 2013 were effectively vaccinated [44]. In our study, influenza was also highly prevalent in the URT, but not the LRT, of patients under the age of 40 years, suggesting that this population present less severe disease due to this virus but nevertheless play a major role in driving the influenza epidemic, as also suggested for populations of children in previous studies [45]. Not all our mPCR tests were able to fully discriminate influenza subtypes, but the data obtained with the others indicates a similar distribution of subtypes to that described for the corresponding period in France (data not shown) [46,47].",

It is not, therefore, possible to assess the clinical impact of respiratory viruses, their nosocomial or community origins or potential associations with bacteria. Another limitation is the absence of international, national or uniform local recommendations concerning the use of mPCR. The local case definition requiring mPCR may have changed, accounting for the gradual increase in the number of tests performed over the study period, from 854 in the first year to 2296 in the last. Thus, no data are available concerning the number of suspected cases not tested by mPCR, although our lower global positivity rate than observed in previous studies may suggest that these tests are widely used by physicians in our hospital group. Concerning the picornavirus group, none of our mPCR test can discriminate between rhinovirus or enterovirus subtypes with a strong robustness. Thus, we cannot assess in the current work any differential distribution or pathogenicity within this large viral group and specific studies are needed. The prevalence of the bocavirus group was clearly underestimated in this study, as these viruses are not detected by the Respifinder 19\u00ae or FilmArray\u2122 tests (26.4% of the total number of samples tested). However, bocaviruses were found to be very rare in our adult population, accounting for only 1.3% of all viruses identified. A last limitation is the change of mPCR tests used in our laboratory during the study period. All these changes were made with the aim of shortening the time required to obtain the results (48 worked hours for the Respifinder\u00ae test, 24 h for Anyplex\u2122 and less than 2 h for the FilmArray\u00ae test). These changes may have introduced some bias into the viral distribution despite the good year-to-year reproducibility of our results and the local assessment of mPCR performances before the introduction of each test.",

In pediatric populations, in which respiratory virus pathogenicity has been well demonstrated for some viral groups, rapid mPCR assays have been shown to improve the detection of respiratory viruses and to decrease the time required to obtain results, thereby making it possible to decrease the duration of antibiotic treatment or the time spent in the emergency department [25,48]. In adults, evidence for the pathogenicity of respiratory viruses is increasingly evidenced [6,19\u201323], but antibiotic treatment is often continued after positive PCR tests for viruses, even with a normal chest radiography; further studies and new recommendations are therefore required today [49]. A recent study, paving the way for a future large trial, reported a halving of the duration of antibiotic treatment with a diagnostic strategy based on both PCT and mPCR testing [31]. Respiratory viruses also present a burden in hospital settings through the risk of nosocomial infections. Only influenza tests are currently performed, during epidemic periods, to isolate infected patients and to use specific treatments. Recommendations for patient isolation in cases of infection with other respiratory viruses are unclear, despite recent studies showing that viral infections are neither frequent nor uncommon in patients with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia [22,23]. Larger studies are required to determine the need to enlarge viral detection and patient isolation measures to non-influenza viruses in adults and children.",

However, the high rates of positivity obtained in this study in real-life hospital settings highlights the large burden of these infections. This is particularly true for groups of viruses that have been largely neglected, such as picornaviruses, when current research efforts focus principally on the development of vaccines and drugs against influenza and RSV. Large prospective studies, including clinical observations and bacterial investigations, are much needed to assess the pathogenicity of picornaviruses and other non-influenza respiratory viruses more precisely, as well as to evaluate and establish new recommendations for their management in hospital settings.",
