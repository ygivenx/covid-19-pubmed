Once activated, caspase-1 proteolytically cleaves interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18 precursors (pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18), leading to the release of mature forms [2, 3]. Among identified inflammasomes, the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome containing NLRP3, adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 is the most fully studied [4]. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a two-step process. The first step involves a priming signal provided by microbial molecules or endogenous cytokines, which upregulates the transcription of inactive NLRP3, pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18. The second step is characterized by the oligomerization of NLRP3 and subsequent assembly of NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1 into a complex [5]. This signal is provided by numerous stimuli such as ATP, pore-forming toxins, viral RNA, etc. Most of them induce potassium efflux, calcium signaling, reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal rupture [6].",

Surprisingly, although NLRP3 inflammasome could be activated by vesicular stomatitis and encephalomyocarditis viruses, it seemed to have no influence on the pathogenesis of these two viruses [16]. In the case of influenza A virus infection, several studies investigating the role of NLRP3 inflammasome have yielded controversial results [17\u201320], leading to the conclusion that NLRP3 inflammasome might play a dual protective or detrimental role at different stages of influenza A virus infection [21].",

This virus is one of the leading causes of respiratory tract disease in both children and adults. The adaptive immune response generated against HMPV is usually inefficient at protecting from reinfections, which are repeated throughout life [23]. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent HMPV infection and its treatment is still limited to the use of ribavirin, a weakly effective antiviral agent, and immunoglobulins [24]. Thus, highlighting the role of NLRP3 inflammasome during HMPV infection may provide a new perspective on the prevention and treatment of this viral disease. To date, only one study has reported increases in the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, accompanied by an upregulation of NLRP3 mRNA expression in HMPV-infected children, as compared to control healthy individuals [25]. However, the authors did not clarify the role of NLRP3 inflammasome during HMPV infection.",

A recent study has reported that MCC950 did not impact the viability and proliferation of high-glucose-induced human retinal endothelial cells at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM [28]. In the current study, we also showed that this inhibitor was safe and usable for both human THP-1 (CC50 > 250 \u03bcM) and murine J774.2 (CC50 > 125 \u03bcM) cells (S1 Fig). To determine if NLRP3 inflammasome impacts HMPV replication, THP-1 or J774.2 cells were treated or not with 10 \u03bcM of MCC950 because this dose has been shown to be able to block NLRP3 activation in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages, human monocyte derived macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [26], and then infected with HMPV. The viral loads evaluated on days 1, 2 and 3 post-infection did not differ between MCC950-treated and control DMSO-treated groups (Fig 1A). We also observed that viral titers were relatively low, but as expected since no trypsin was added during the cell culture assay.

We also confirm that NLRP3 is responsible for the maturation of only IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 [29], as evidenced by no difference in IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels between MCC950-treated and control groups during HMPV infection (Fig 1C). Of note, we observed no IL-6 production in THP-1 cells upon HMPV inoculation. In order to confirm those results, we used wild-type (WT) bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) and NLRP3 KO BMDM cell lines and observed that HMPV-infected BMDM cells induced the production of IL-1\u03b2 at 48 h, but not HMPV\u0394SH-infected BMDM (S2 Fig).

No difference in survival and weight loss between IL-18BP-treated and non-treated mice was observed during HMPV infection (Fig 5A). Thus, the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of HMPV is IL-18-independent. Interestingly, we noticed that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition always protected mice against HMPV disease even if virus was administered at a lethal dose, as evidenced by no mortality and slight weight loss (<10% initial weight) in MCC950-treated compared to DMSO-treated mice.

We then evaluated caspase-1 cleavage as a marker of NLRP3 inflammasome activation because caspase-1 cleavage depends on the assembly of NLRP3, ASC and procaspase-1 to form inflammasome [5]. Western Blot analysis showed that HMPV inoculation induced caspase-1 cleavage in THP-1 cells (Fig 6). This cleavage, however, was prevented by MCC950 treatment. These results confirm the capacity of HMPV to induce NLRP3 inflammasome. In parallel, we found that HMPV \u0394SH could not induce caspase-1 cleavage in THP-1 cells (Fig 6). Thus, SH protein seems to be the viral component triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation, but other experiments are needed to determine if the mutant virus simply becomes inaccessible to pro-inflammatory danger sensors via compartmentalization or if it is physically unable to prime or activate the inflammasome. Cleaved caspase-1 was detected in both cell lysates and supernatants at 1 h but was only present in the cell supernatants at 24 h post-infection. This indicates that caspase-1 was rapidly cleaved and released into the supernatants [33] upon HMPV inoculation.",

Herein, we demonstrate that the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of HMPV only proceeds via its pro-inflammatory effect. Indeed, both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that viral replication was almost unaltered whereas inflammation was attenuated upon NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition during HMPV infection. This finding is consistent with two other studies which have also shown that NLRP3 inflammasome did not impact on viral replication during influenza and chikungunya diseases [21, 38]. Nevertheless, the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome has been demonstrated to decrease fulminant hepatitis and Zika virus replication [10, 13] but increase Newcastle virus replication [9]. In other words, NLRP3 inflammasome plays distinct roles in the replication of RNA viruses.",

Furthermore, three other inflammatory parameters including the alteration of pulmonary capillary permeability, leukocyte recruitment and lung histopathological scores were also decreased upon NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. These data are not unique and they are consistent with several previous reports [17\u201319, 21, 26, 38].

We suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome exerts pro-inflammatory effect during HMPV infection through biological activities of IL-1\u03b2. Indeed, this cytokine has been identified as an important regulator of inflammation, as evidenced by its capacity to stimulate neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and infiltration in some conditions [42, 43] and induce lung vascular permeability damage [44]. IL-1\u03b2 has also been identified as an activator of IL-6 and IL-8 production [45, 46]. Most importantly, we reported that both NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition (BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice) and deletion of the gene encoding IL-1\u03b2 (C57BL/6 mice) induced less weight loss with decreased mortality and inflammation in HMPV-infected mice. Moreover, the protective effect against HMPV disease did not differ between NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and IL-1\u03b2 deletion (C57BL/6 mice). Briefly, NLRP3 inflammasome-induced IL-1\u03b2 release plays a crucial role during HMPV infection, at least in mice.",

Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition was found to decrease IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 levels in BAL from BALB/c mice (Fig 3) but only IFN-\u03b3 levels in the case of C57BL/6 mice on day 5 post-infection (Fig 5C). In parallel, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in BAL from BALB/c mice were strongly higher than those from C57BL/6 mice (Figs 3 and 5C & S4A Fig). All these findings indicate that HMPV-induced inflammation is more severe in BALB/c than C57BL/6 mice and that the role of NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1\u03b2 is more important in the former mice during HMPV infection.

This finding is not surprising since IL-1\u03b2 as well as other IL-1 family cytokines are widely considered as early-response cytokines as they are released in the earliest stage of an immune response [48]. By contrast, IL-18 secretion was unaltered during infection and had no influence on the pathogenicity of HMPV in mice. This might be explained by the limited presence of macrophages during HMPV infections, which were shown to be an abundant source of IL-18 during in vitro studies [49] (Fig 1B). By contrast, polymorphonuclear neutrophils were abundant on day 1 and then lymphocytes were dominant on days 3 and 5 post-infection (Fig 4C).",

In general, the first signal permitting the generation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 is triggered by the recognition of viral pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors [5]. Herein, we did not investigate the mechanisms by which the first signal occurs. However, we think that the TLR4 receptor may be responsible for this process because a recent study has demonstrated that among various TLRs including TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8, only TLR4 provides the first signal of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in RSV-infected lung epithelial cells [39]. Furthermore, TLR4-/- mice induced less weight loss, decreased inflammation and no difference in viral replication, as compared to wild-type mice during HMPV infection [50]. These findings are consistent with our results when using either IL-1\u03b2-/- mice or pharmacological approach for blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",

            "text": "Recently, it has been shown that RNA viruses trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation through a receptor interacting protein (RIP) 1/RIP3/dynamin-related protein 1 signaling pathway [51, 52]. Briefly, RNA virus infection initiates the assembly of RIP1/RIP3 complex, promoting activation of dynamin-related protein 1 and its translocation to mitochondria. This results in mitochondria damage, excessive reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation [6]. RNA viral components responsible for triggering this pathway have been identified in several viral infections such as influenza virus M2 and PB1-F2 proteins [53\u201355], Measles virus V protein [56], RSV SH protein [39], encephalomyocarditis virus and rhinovirus 2B proteins [57, 58], coronavirus E protein [59] and enterovirus 71 3D protein [60]. Among these proteins, encephalomyocarditis virus and rhinovirus 2B proteins as well as RSV SH protein were recognized as viroporins. Viroporins from RNA viruses have been reported to be responsible for mitochondrial alteration [61]. Furthermore, once inserted on host cell membrane, viroporin will enable virus to tune ion permeability to stimulate a variety of viral cycle stages [62]. Taken together, we hypothesized that HMPV SH protein may be an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome during HMPV disease because it has been suggested to act as a viroporin [63] and the genomic structure of HMPV is closely related to that of RSV [40].",

Here, we generated HMPV \u0394SH using C85473 strain (group A) to verify our hypothesis [64]. In addition to the blockade of caspase-1 cleavage, a reliable marker of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting from the lack of SH protein or MCC950 treatment, we found that identically to MCC950 treatment, SH deletion had no effect on the viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. This finding is consolidated by previous studies using other HMPV \u0394SH viruses [34, 35]. We also detected that HMPV \u0394SH-infected mice were protected against severe infection, as evidenced by no mortality, less weight loss and reduced inflammation. The evolution of HMPV infections was not different between HMPV \u0394SH- and wild-type HMPV-infected mice receiving MCC950 treatment, but we acknowledge that no measures were taken to detect defective interfering particles in both viral preparations. In parallel, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition had no influence on the pathogenesis of HMPV \u0394SH. Taken together, we conclude that HMPV SH protein might be an activator of NLRP3 inflammasome in addition to its identified other roles to modulate type I IFN signaling pathway [65, 66], deteriorate cell host membrane permeability, regulate viral fusogenic function [63] and reduce CD4+ T cell activation [67].",

Mechanistically, HMPV SH protein triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to form mature IL-1\u03b2. Although this cytokine is not crucial for controlling viral replication, it plays a major role in inflammatory process which is identified as an important feature for the pathogenicity of HMPV. Thus, the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome in HMPV disease occurs via IL-1\u03b2-related inflammatory process rather than virus replication. In such a context, we believe that anti-inflammatory treatments in general and anti-IL-1\u03b2 drugs in particular (i.e. the use of NLRP3 inhibitors) may be considered as novel potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of HMPV disease.",

Briefly, the full-length genomic cDNA of HMPV A1/C-85473 strain was generated by RT-PCR using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and amplified by Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Whitby, ON, Canada). A Gibson Assembly (Cloning Kit, New England Biolabs) was performed to integrate the genomic viral cDNA into a pSP72 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) containing a T7 terminator, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme and a T7 promoter. To generate HMPV \u0394SH virus, the mentioned plasmid was amplified using specific primers, designed to match before the SH gene start sequence (5\u2019-GGGACAAGTAGTTATGGA-3\u2019) and after the intergenic SH-G region (5\u2019-ACTCTGATGTGTTTTTACTAAC-3\u2019), in order to extract completely the SH gene sequence. After amplification, linear DNA was phosphorylated and ligated with the T4 Ligase to re-circularize the shortened HMPV genome. The newly generated HMPV \u0394SH genomic plasmid was validated by complete sequencing prior to transfection. BSR-T7 cells were then co-transfected (Lipofectamin 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the HMPV \u0394SH genomic plasmid and 4 supporting plasmids expressing the N, P, L, and M2.1 viral ORFs. Seven hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by Opti-MEM supplemented with 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for four days. At this point, LLC-MK2 cells were added to the transfected BSR T7 cells and co-cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 with the addition of fresh trypsin (0.0002%) after two days. Two or three days after co-culture, cells were harvested, sonicated and centrifuged at 2000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected, diluted into infection medium (Opti-MEM supplemented with 0.0002% trypsin), and inoculated onto confluent LLC-MK2 monolayers. Infected monolayers were monitored for the appearance of characteristic cytopathic effect, and the harvested virus was further amplified through serial passages in LLC-MK2 cells.",

(C) BALB/c mice were inoculated or not with HMPV at a LD50 dose (5 x 105 PFU per mouse) or HMPV \u0394SH in the presence or absence of MCC950 (5 mg/kg). MCC950 treatment was repeated for the next two days (1 time/day). The animals were monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days after infection and euthanized if humane end points were reached (\u2264 20% of initial weight). Values are shown as mean of weight \u00b1 S.E.M or average percent survival (Kaplan Meier survial curves, *** P < 0.001 HMPV/MCC950, HMPV\u0394SH or HMPV \u0394SH/MCC950 vs HMPV, n = 10 per group). The lungs and BAL were harvested on day 5 post-infection. (D-F) IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, total protein and leukocyte recruitment were evaluated in BAL (n = 5 per group). (G) histopathology was assessed in the lungs (n = 4 per group). Values are shown as mean \u00b1 S.E.M (Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s post hoc, * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01 HMPV/MCC950, HMPV\u0394SH or HMPV \u0394SH/MCC950 vs HMPV). (H) Viral titers were evaluated in lung homogenates. Values are shown as mean \u00b1 S.E.M (Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn\u2019s post hoc, n = 5 per group).",
