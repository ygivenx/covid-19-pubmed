            "text": "In the past few decades, a basic but crucial task in biology is comparing genes and proteins for predicting the structure and function of these biological sequences. Many methods have been proposed to compare genetic sequences. Traditionally, most of these approaches are the widely used alignment-based methods. In these methods, molecular sequences are optimally aligned based on selected scoring systems. The alignment-based methods often give high accuracy and may reveal the relationships among sequences. Some algorithms have been established and incorporated into softwares for sequence alignments1,2. However, one of the main drawback of these techniques is that they are very time-consuming and expensive in memory usage. As a result, alignment-free approaches have attracted more and more attention and have been applied to biological sequence comparison as well as phylogeny analysis recently3\u20137. The noticeable characteristic of these methods is to incorporate some ad hoc numerical feature of sequences. These methods are fast in computational speed when comparing genes and proteins. Generally, alignment-free are categorized into four groups: methods based on k-mer or word frequency, methods based on substrings, methods based on information theory, and methods based on graphical representation. Firstly, methods based k-mer or word frequency are very popular and studied extensively. The classic k-mer method was proposed to compare genetic sequences, in which it counts the frequencies of substrings with k letters appearing in respective sequences8. Afterwards, a lot of k-mer based methods have been developed and applied in sequence analysis and phylogeny for viruses and bacteria. Such as feature frequency profile (FFP)9 which counts the number of substrings with fixed length k occurring in a genome9 and a vector consisting of these numbers is formed for each genome, return time distribution (RTD)10, frequency chaos game representation (FCGR)11, an improved complete composition vector method (ICCV)12 which was proposed by optimizing composition vector (CV)13 and complete composition vector (CCV)14. ICCV is under the assumption of a uniform and independent model to estimate sequence information. Comparing with CCV and CV method, ICCV method is more robust and efficient in performing sequence comparison. Secondly, methods based on substrings employ the similarity of substrings in a pair of sequences. These algorithms are mostly used for string processing in computer science, like average common substring (ACS)15, k-mismatch average common substring approach (kmacs)16. Thirdly, methods based on information theory include global and local characterization of sequences and estimate genome entrop to regions. Among them base-base correlation (BBC)17, information correlation and partial information correlation (IC-PIC)18 are representative articles. Finally, methods based on graphical representation also play important roles in sequence comparison in alignment-free area19\u201321.",

            "text": "Although k-mer models are widely used in many biological studies, the position information and the properties of nucleotides is ignored in these methods. The second kind of methods are computationally expensive among alignment-free methods. For the third algorithms, most of them are alignment based. The graph based methods are often used to display some characteristics of sequences directly by curves. Therefore, it is better to use these information for sequences comparison. In this paper, we develop an 18 dimensional feature vector to characterize a DNA sequence. The vector includes the occurrence frequency of each of the four bases, the average position of nucleotides and the biochemical properties of nucleotides. To validate the advantages of our approach, we test it on several data sets and further make comparison with some state-of-the-art sequence analysis techniques. Our method performs as good as alignment methods in accuracy and spends far less time than them. For one viral dataset, it even provides better result than alignment methods. It also works better than k-mer based methods in accuracy.",

In these mammals, the structure of mtDNA is circular and double-stranded. One strand of each mtDNA has rich guanine referred to as the heavy strand and the other strand includes rich cytosine referred to as the light strand. In our study, the heavy strands of mtDNA are chosen. These sequences are not highly conserved and have a fast mutation rate22. Using our proposed method along with UPGMA algorithm, the phylogenetic tree of 41 mitochondrial genomes is constructed. As displayed in Fig. 1, the 41 species are correctly grouped into 8 clusters: Primates (red), Cetacea (green), Artiodactyla (pink), Perissodactyla (light green), Rodentia (black), Lagomorpha (dark red), Carnivore (blue), and Erinaceomorpha (grey). According to the FFP method, length of substrings is chosen to be 7 and thus the phylogeny of the 41 species is obtained. The phylogenetic tree is provided in the supplementary file. As displayed in Fig. S1, the 8 clusters are not classified well. The four species in Perissodactyla are improperly clustered into two clades. Indus River Dolphin from Cetacea is separated from other species from Cetacea. The Carnivore, Primates and Artiodactyla clades are all mistakenly divided into more than one group. Obviously, for this dataset our new method gets a greater result.\n",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses may cause influenza disease in birds and mammals23. Influenza A viruses are single-stranded, negative-sense, segmented RNA viruses. The genome of flu virus contains around 13500 nucleotides and is divided into 8 segments. The subtypes of Influenza A viruses are classified according to an H number for the type of hemagglutinin (H) and an N number for the type of neuraminidase (N) in viral surfaces24. The viruses have 18 different H serotypes (H1-H18) and 11 different N (N1-N11) serotypes. For instance, the recently appearing H7N3 is an Influenza A strain with a type 7 hemagglutinin (H) and a type 3 neuraminidase (N). The several subtypes of Influenza A viruses are able to infect many species including wild birds, swines, dogs, horses, and even humans. It is known that H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes can circulate among humans. In this study, we utilize Segment 6 gene encoding N (neuraminidase) of Influenza A virus to perform phylogenetic analysis. Using our method, the 38 flu viruses are correctly clustered into five groups as show in Fig. 2. Our result is consistent with previous study25. According to the FFP method, the choice for length of k-mer of these viruses is 5 and their phylogenetic tree is constructed. As shown in Fig. S2 (in the supplementary file), however, some of the H1N1 viruses and some H5N1 viruses are placed together. Therefor, on this dataset our method is also superior than FFP.\n",

HRVs are the major cause of the common colds and lead to more than one-half of cold-like diseases. HRVs are single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses of about 7200 nucleotides in length. The genome of Human rhinovirus contains a single gene encoding one polyprotein, which is then cleaved to yield 11 proteins. HRVs belong to Enterovirus genus and Picornaviridae family. They form three phylogenetically distinct clusters: HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C4,26. In the previous work, 113 complete genomes composed of the three clusters are used to explore their evolutionary relationships. In addition, 3 HEV-C genomes were also added to the dataset as outgroup. Based on multiple sequence alignment (MSA), the evaluation was very time-consuming although the classification performed well. Unlike the MSA, our new approach is very fast to finish conversion from the genome sequences to 18 dimensional vectors. As shown in Fig. 3, the three groups of 116 genomes are identified and the remaining 3 outgroup viruses are clustered together alone. According to the FFP method, the length of words chosen for this dataset is 6 and the phylogenetic tree of 116 HRVs is obtained. As shown in Fig. S3 (in the supplementary file), two HRV-A viruses are mixed with the outlying HEV-C viruses.\n",

The EBOV strains in the 2014 epidemic in Guinea are clustered together. The EBOV strains in Zaire (DRC) pandemic in 1976\u20131977 are placed together as a clade. The three EBOV strains from the 1995 outbreak in Zaire (DRC) form a clade. The EBOV strains in DRC pandemic in 2007 are clustered together. The strains from the two epidemics occurred in Gabon are divided into two different clusters according to the outbreak periods. The SUDV branch is clustered with the RESTV branch. BDBV and TAFV viruses are positioned together. Our results are consistent with those in previous work27,29. Since the viral genomes in this dataset have about 19 kilobases, the k-mer length is thus 7. The phylogenetic relationships among these viruses using FFP method are depicted in Fig. S4 (in the supplementary file). However, the SUDV branch is not clustered with RESTV branch in this figure, which is not consistent with the confirmed taxonomy of Ebolavirus genus.\n",

The new isolated HCoV-HKU1 was thought as a distinct member of group 231. However, the HCoV-HKU1 was designated as a member of a new group 532. Using our novel method, the phylogeny of the coronaviruses is reconstructed based on the UPGMA algorithm. As shown in Fig. 5, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E are grouped into group 1 as validated in the previous research33. Group 2, group 4, and new group 5 are separated in the tree, which is consistent with the studies in published papers31,32. According to the FFP method, the length of substrings chosen for these organisms is 6 and the phylogeny is constructed. As displayed in Fig. S5 (in the supplementary file) the HCoV-229E virus from group 1 is not correctly classified into group 2. Besides, the four viruses as outgroup are not clustered together.

As a result, the classification of bacteria based on whole genome sequences have attracted more and more attention. Due to long genomic sequences of bacteria with more than 1 million base pairs (Mb), the tradition multiple sequence alignment methods are computationally infeasible to perform phylogeny. To test our model, we analyze a dataset consisting of 59 bacterial species. This set contains 15 families: Aeromonadaceae, Alcaligenaceae, Bacilleceae, Borreliaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, Desulfovibrionaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Erwiniaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Mycoplasmataceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Staphylococcaceae, Yersiniaceae. The genome length in this dataset mainly range from 3 to 10 Mb. As displayed in Fig. 6, the 15 families are well separated using our method. Based on the 9-mer FFP method, these families are also separated as illustrated in Fig. S6 (in the supplementary file). The two results are same for the phylogeny of 59 bacteria at the family level. However, our tree has some advantages at the phylum level. In Fig. 6, the three families Lactobacillaceae, Clostridiaceae and Staphylococcaceae from phylum Bacilli are clustered together. In the tree constructed by FFP model (Fig. S6), however, Lactobacillaceae are placed near to Mycoplasmataceae from phylum Tenericutes. Family Desulfovibrionaceae from phylum Proteobacteria are positioned in phylum Bacilli. Moreover, family Clostridiaceae from phylum Bacilli are grouped with Borreliaceae from pylum Spirochaetes. For the running time of algorithms, it is very time-consuming to calculate feature frequency profiles vectors with 49 = 262144 dimensions. Since our vectors have 18 features, it takes only about 5 minutes to get these vectors.\n",

According to the results mentioned above, our proposed alignment-free method shows its advantages on accuracy over alignment-based methods. Compared to a state-of-the-art method based on k-mer, the new technique still has the merit to construct correct evolutionary relationships.
