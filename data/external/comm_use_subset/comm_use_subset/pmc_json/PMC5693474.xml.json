It is well established that peripheral inflammation can give rise to neuroinflammation and is linked closely to the etiology and progress of neurodegenerative diseases [4, 5]. One famous study showed that a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in an elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the delayed loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SN [6]. On the other hand, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could decrease the incidence of PD [7, 8].

Recently, a growing body of research is concentrated on the role of monocytes play in disorders of the CNS [13]. One of our recent studies showed that depletion of peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) attenuated not only peripheral inflammation but also neuroinflammation induced by peripheral LPS injection. Our results demonstrated that monocytes are the peripheral decisive elements in the process of neuroinflammation induced by peripheral inflammation [14]. Moreover, monocyte and microglia are considered to share the same origin of the myeloid lineage [15, 16]; mounting evidence reveals that monocytes could infiltrate into the brain and develop into microglia [17] or construct a special group of macrophages [18]. These findings imply that the immune response of peripheral blood monocytes is of profound significance to the progression and prognosis of the neuroinflammation.",

This sampling technique was previously described in detail with some modifications [25, 26], which is unaffected by the volume of reference or the size of the counted elements [27]. The coronal serial sections (20 \u03bcm) used for counting covered the entire SN, from the rostral tip of the pars compacta (AP, \u2212 4.30 mm) back to the caudal end of the pars reticulate (AP, \u2212 6.72 mm). This generally yielded about 120 sections in each rat. For the estimation of the total numbers of TH-positive neurons in the SN, every sixth section was counted; moreover, a counting frame of 40 \u00d7 40 \u03bcm and a grid size of 150 \u00d7 150 \u03bcm was used. Guard volume (4 \u03bcm from the top, 4\u20136 \u03bcm from the bottom of the section) was excluded from both surfaces to avoid the problem of lost cap, and only the profiles that came into focus within the counting volume (with a depth of 10 \u03bcm) were counted. The estimate of the total numbers of TH-positive neurons was calculated according to the optical fractionator formula [27].",

Endotoxic tolerance is always induced by a low dose of LPS and deemed as the most essential component of immune tolerance when suffering from subsequent inflammatory challenge [20, 30]. Our study indicated that repeated intraperitoneal injection of 0.3 mg/kg LPS for consecutive 4 days is indeed to induce the endotoxic tolerance of PBM characterized by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and downregulated TLR4 expression under further LPS restimulation [31, 32]. Decreased inflammatory cytokines showed the peripheral immune tolerance induced-hypoactive state of PBM. TLR4 serve as the major pattern recognition receptors involved in the detection of LPS so that downregulation of TLR4 expression means diminished inflammatory response of PBM [33, 34].

[6]. However, the dose of LPS we used in the present study was considered to be a low-dose (0.3 mg/kg). Intracephalic immune status was monitored after repeated low-dose LPS injection-induced peripheral immune tolerance. The results indicated that repeated low-dose LPS intraperitoneal injection was insufficient to cause inflammation within the SN of healthy rats (there was neither an increase of inflammatory cytokines nor an upregulation of Iba-1). Previous studies demonstrate that the levels and distribution of inflammatory factors in the brain vary with the various dosage of peripheral LPS administration [4, 35]. Quan et al. confirmed that high dose of LPS induced global expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain, whereas low dose of LPS increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression only in the choroid plexus, circumventricular organs, and meninges without brain parenchyma [36]. This conclusion coincides with our results, although other regions outside the SN have not been measured in our study. In addition, we also observed the neuronal morphology and the total numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the SN after repeated intraperitoneal LPS administration. Our results revealed that the immunoreactivity of TH expressed on dopaminergic neurons was preserved in the SN.",

Our results showed that peripheral immune tolerance preconditioning attenuates the intracranial LPS injection-induced neuroinflammation, manifested as the decrease of inflammatory cytokines and the inhibition of microglial activation. This suggests that the regulation of PBM immune status could affect the progression of neuroinflammation [13]. We speculated that the neuroinflammatory alleviation was induced by peripheral immune tolerance preconditioning through the following ways: (a) Monocytes and microglia are considered to share the same origin of the myeloid lineage [37]; thus, immune tolerance pre-treatment induced hypo-responsiveness of monocytes may reflect the weakened immune activity of microglia in the brain correspondingly [38]. (b) Immune tolerant PBM may decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines infiltrating from periphery into the brain correspondingly [39, 40]. (c) Peripheral immune tolerance may impair immune activity of PBM, which would migrate from the periphery into the brain through development into microglia directly or interacting with microglia indirectly to aggravate neuronal damage after neuroinflammation [41, 42]. (d) Peripheral immune tolerance may reshape the central microenvironment under neuroinflammation challenge by lessening interaction between PBM and other cells in the brain, such as perivascular cells [43] as well as endothelial cells of the BBB [44]. (e) Hypo-reactive PBM induced by peripheral immune tolerance may be associated with reduced T cellular infiltration into the brain [17, 45].",

Besides, LPS preconditioning conferred neuroprotection has been proved in traumatic brain injury [22] and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest [23]. In accordance with these results, we observed that peripheral immune tolerant preconditioning-induced hypo-responsiveness of PBM led to a significant neuroprotection from subsequent neurodegeneration.
