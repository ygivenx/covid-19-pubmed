            "text": "Oncolytic adenoviruses (Ad) have emerged as a promising new therapy in the fight against cancer. Adenoviruses are a family of non-enveloped DNA viruses comprised of 51 different serotypes organized into 6 species (A\u2013F) [1]. The viral capsid is an icosahedron which is composed of hexon and penton base proteins. Attached to each penton base is a fiber protein which consists of three regions, the tail, the shaft, and the knob regions. Initial binding of these viruses to cells is mediated through interactions between the viral fiber protein and various cell receptors which differ somewhat between the species. After initial binding, all adenoviral species undergo internalization via engaging \u03b1\u03bd integrins as secondary receptors [2].",

The cellular protein, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), has been found to be the main receptor implicated in binding of most adenoviral serotypes. Species A and C\u2013F all utilize CAR for initial binding [3,4,5]. Species B adenoviruses comprise two subspecies: the B1 group (Ad3, Ad7, Ad16, Ad21, and Ad50) and B2 (Ad11, Ad14, Ad34, and Ad35). Species B viruses are associated with infection of a variety of human organ systems including the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, the kidney, and the eye [5]. Discovery of the receptors utilized by group B adenoviruses proved to be quite challenging. The membrane regulator protein of complement activation named CD46 was found to bind most of the serotypes of Species B adenovirus [6]. Marttila et al. concluded that CD46 was used by all group B serotypes except Ad3 and Ad7, while Sirena et al. demonstrated that Ad3 also binds CD46 [7,8]. A second receptor, initially known as receptor X and later identified as a cell adhesion molecule called Desmoglein 2 (DSG2), is also implicated in initial binding for Ad3, Ad7, Ad11, and Ad14 [9,10]. CD80 and CD86 have also been reported to play a role in binding, although these are currently thought to be of less importance [11].",

The majority of conventional Ad-based vectors utilize the human Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) serotype which belongs to the species C adenoviruses. The Ad5 genome has been well characterized and is easily manipulated. Because species C viruses utilize CAR for initial binding, replication-competent Ad5-based cancer therapeutics are effective for cancers with upregulated CAR expression. Unfortunately, these viral constructs have understandably exhibited low-efficacy in CAR-deficient cancers such as pancreas, gastric, melanoma, prostate, colon, ovarian, breast, and others [12]. To overcome this problem, intensive work has been done to develop Ad-based vectors that can undergo CAR-independent entry.",

Since then, infectivity-enhanced vectors utilizing species B binding domains (Ad5/3, Ad5/35, Ad11) have demonstrated remarkable superiority in many cancers relative to the parental Ad5 strain and have revolutionized the field of oncolytic virus therapy [10,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22].",

Their widespread use has been hampered because they are a difficult species to work with and have limited commercial availability [26]. Syrian hamsters have emerged as an essential animal model for evaluation of species C serotypes [26,31,32,33,34,35,36]. These animals have been studied extensively and are known to support Ad5 replication.

Jogler et al. took the experiments further, evaluating Ad5 in vivo, and showed evidence of effective replication in pigs [23]. While this study did provide some promising data, it was limited by the early time points used to demonstrate productive viral replication and by the use of only a single animal in each group for the in vivo studies. Difficulty and expense of working with such a large animal with few commercially available cell lines have limited the wide acceptance of this model.

In fluorescent captured images (Figure 5b), we observed expression of both Ad hexon and NIS in PK15 cells infected with both Ad5 and Ad5/3 viruses. Quantitative assessment of NIS positive PK15 cells using flow cytometry analysis (Figure 5c) revealed similar levels of NIS-positive cells 2 days after infection with either Ad5- or Ad5/3. By 5-days post infection, after giving the virus sufficient time to replicate, we observed that the percentage of NIS-positive PK15 cells after Ad5/3 infection was 4-fold greater than that observed after Ad5-fiber unmodified infection (p < 0.05). These in vitro experiments are the first to demonstrate the ability of porcine cells to support replication-dependent gene expression associated with Ad5/3-retargeted vectors and even suggest its superiority over Ad5 vectors.",

Liver biopsies were obtained on days 1, 2, and 4. Necropsy was performed on day 7 and major organs were evaluated for viral infection. Seven days post infection with either vector, adenoviral DNA was detected in the pigs\u2019 lung and spleen (>1000 AdE4 copy/\u00b5g DNA) (Figure 6a). The viral DNA quantity in lungs and spleens correlated well with replication-dependent Luc expression (~2500 RLU/\u00b5g and ~2000 RLU/\u00b5g, respectively), measuring similar levels of Luc activity with both Ad5- and Ad5/3-\u2206E3-Luc (Figure 6b). Interestingly, unlike in mice, no liver tropism was observed in pigs. Viral replication in liver tissues was almost negligible, demonstrating much lower levels of viral DNA in liver biopsies at earlier time points (<30.0 AdE4 copy/\u00b5g) and background values 7 days post infection. Again, DNA copy numbers correlated well with the Luc expression in liver biopsies. These results confirm the ability of adenoviral vectors to actively replicate in live swine after systemic administration, further supporting the usefulness of pigs as a potential model testing adenoviral vectors, including species B-retargeted viral constructs.",

Because of the difficulty in establishing an animal model for Ad5 vectors, coupled with the known difference of Ad3 receptors, we felt that it was essential to directly address the Syrian hamster\u2019s ability to undergo productive infection with chimeric serotype Ad5/3 vectors. Our studies suggest that Syrian hamsters are far less permissive for Ad5/3 than for Ad5. While we confirmed clear evidence of Ad5 replication and replication-dependent cell death in hamster cells, similar results were absent in cells infected with Ad5/3 vectors. Poor infectivity after Ad5/3 infection of Syrian hamster cells has been reported in literature by others [47].",

Indeed, a few groups have reported CD46 expression in mice and rats is limited to the testes [48,49]. Our binding and gene transfer assays, which directly assess viral entry, demonstrated very low viral entry and negligible transduction efficiency in hamster cells infected with Ad5/3 viruses. When directly compared to human A549 control cell line, hamster cells infected with Ad5/3 showed 40 to 80-fold lower virus biding and at least 5000-fold lower transduction efficiency. A complete and more detailed analysis of Ad5 (CAR) and Ad3 (CD46 and DSG2) receptor expression in non-human cell lines is needed to further elucidate the reasons that lead to differences in infectivity. However, due to major differences in the nucleotide sequences between species, a single primer or antibody will be insufficient to objectively compare the receptor expression pattern. Therefore, we believe that the functional binding assay provides the most accurate evaluation of the binding ability of Ad5/3 vectors in non-human species. Cell viability and replication assays showed no Syrian hamster cell death with Ad5/3 viruses. When compared to constructs expressing Ad5 binding domains, replication dependent gene expression was nearly two orders of magnitude lower when hamster cells were infected with viruses expressing Ad3 binding domains. This series of experiments convincingly demonstrates that Syrian hamsters are not a permissive host for productive infection with Ad5/3 adenoviral vectors and as such, these animals cannot provide meaningful preclinical data.",

Because this viral DNA could potentially be secondary to sequestration of the inoculated viral particles and not actually from viral replication, we have examined the tissues for replication-dependent luciferase expression. The pig tissues exhibited the same pattern of Luc expression, with the highest levels of transgene being seen in the lungs and spleen. Again, the levels of gene expression between the two different viral constructs were not significantly different.

All Ad5/3 vectors had a chimeric fiber composed of the Ad5 shaft and the Ad3 knob which was incorporated as we described previously [14]. In the binding and killing assays we used replication-competent wild type Ad5 (Ad5Wt) and its retargeted counterpart with the Ad5/3 modified fiber (Ad5/3Wt) [14]. To assess the gene transfer, we used a pair of replication-deficient vectors with the luciferase (Luc) inserted under control of the CMV promoter (Ad5CMV-Luc and Ad5/3CMV-Luc) [46]. To assess replication-dependent gene transfer, we used replication competent vectors expressing Luc or Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) (Ad5Wt-\u2206E3-Luc, Ad5Wt-\u2206E3-NIS, respectively). These viral vectors were constructed based on the \u2206E3 structure as was described previously [46,53]. Briefly, we have deleted the non-essential genes within the AdE3-region (\u2206E3) while maintaining the Adenoviral Death Protein (ADP) gene. Replication-competent viruses were propagated in A549, while 911 cells were used to amplify replication-deficient counterparts. The viral vectors were purified by double CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation, followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 10% glycerol. Virus preps were stored in aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C until used.",
