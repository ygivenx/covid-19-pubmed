Despite medical advances, infectious diseases are still a cause of death for millions around the World. Of the estimated 57 million deaths that occur throughout the World each year, more than 25 percent are directly caused by infectious diseases [1]. More than 90 percent of the worldwide mortality from infectious diseases is caused by only a handful of diseases, including lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria and measles (Figure 1) [1]. New targets for novel anti-infective drugs need to be identified, particularly in the light of the emergence of drug resistant strains.",

            "text": "Many herbal medicines have ethnomedicinal uses for the treatment of infectious conditions such as respiratory ailments. However, research programmes are important for validating the traditional use, providing evidence for the safety and the quality of the plant material. That traditionally used herbal medicines may well provide the basis for the development of a modern and highly successful phytopharmaceutical that meets the internationally required criteria of quality, safety and efficacy for an evidence-based therapy is exemplarily shown for Pelargonium sidoides. Members of the genus Pelargonium are highly valued by traditional healers and the South African native population for their curative and palliative effects in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, while interest in P. sidoides has been heightened by reports of therapeutic benefits in infectious conditions of the respiratory tract such as tuberculosis and related diseases. The interesting ethnobotanical and commercial history, as well as the phytochemical profile of this medicinal plant, have been reviewed in detail elsewhere and are thus not reiterated (vide infra). This report is aimed at reviewing the current knowledge on the mechanisms of the underlying beneficial effects of P. sidoides and the related herbal drug preparation EPs\u00ae 7630. Notably, this special extract has been the subject of 20 clinical studies involving more than 9,000 patients, including 3,900 children as young as 1 year, reviewed repeatedly elsewhere (vide infra). The objective of this review is to show the potential of a traditional plant, P. sidoides, for the defence against pathogens and the improvement of immune functions at various levels and, thus, the invaluable role that natural products continue to play in the drug discovery process in the areas of infectious and other diseases.",

In this context it appears important to note the general problems surrounding the taxonomic classification of Pelargonium species, as reflected in the past by numerous revisions. In southern Africa, tuberculosis is one of the most commonly notified diseases. In the absence of an effective chemotherapy in earlier days, traditional healers were widely consulted and many local plants were used to alleviate tuberculosis-related symptoms. As for P. sidoides, a key role in the successful introduction of a profound traditional herbal remedy in modern phytotherapy in Europe is linked to Charles Henry Stevens, who believed he was cured by taking a brew prepared from the roots and subsequently tried to introduce \u201cStevens' Consumption Cure\u201d on the market in Great Britain [5-8].",

Following the well-documented therapeutic benefits in infectious conditions of the respiratory tract, a modern formulation of the roots of P. sidoides, EPs\u00ae 7630 (exclusively contained in Umckaloabo\u00ae, marketed by Spitzner Arzneimittel, Ettlingen, Germany), has been elaborated from this traditional herbal medicine. EPs\u00ae 7630 is a special aqueous ethanolic extract. Results from a number of clinical studies including several randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials, support the use of Umckaloabo\u00ae in respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis, sinusitis and tonsillitis. Several post-marketing surveillance studies are available, demonstrating the safety and tolerability of the traded product [10-18]. Umckaloabo\u00ae was approved in Germany as a drug for treating acute bronchitis. This illness is one of the most frequent diagnoses in medical practice and predominantly caused by RNA viruses. Only in less than 10% of cases non-viral agents play a role in its etiology [19]. Surprisingly, prescription of antibiotics for infections of viral origin is still wide-spread even though their efficacy is limited to bacterial infections [20]. One purpose might be to avoid a secondary bacterial superinfection with group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci. Development of resistant bacteria is a disadvantage of non-indicated antibiotic therapy. Based on clinical studies, the Pelargonium-based preparation offers an alternative therapeutic agent to otherwise not indicated antibiotic treatment.",

Using the radiorespirometric BACTEC method, the extracts showed antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (96% at 12.5 \u03bcg/mL), while none of the purified compounds tested exhibited any antimycobacterial activities under these experimental conditions. The same extract exhibited weak activities against M. tuberculosis (MIC of 100 \u03bcg/mL) as assessed in a broth microdilution alamar blue assay. Rifampicin, used as reference, showed an MIC of 0.06 \u03bcg/mL under the experimental conditions used. Independent support of the weak antimycobacterial activity of P. sidoides was provided by similar studies of acetone and ethanol root extracts using M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis as test organisms, while coumarins and flavonoids isolated from this plant source again proved inactive [4]. With MICs of >1,024 \u03bcg/mL, an aqueous acetone extract of P. sidoides showed negligible antimycobacterial activities against the rapidly growing avirulent M. smegmatis in a broth microdilution assay [21]. Similar results were obtained from testing the extracts against M. aurum, a species reported to be predictive of activity against M. tuberculosis because of their comparable drug sensitivity profiles. This finding suggests that direct antimycobacterial activity apparently depends not only on the strain of mycobacterium, but also strongly on extract preparation and composition.",

Interestingly, all the saturated fatty acids except lauric acid were devoid of any antimycobacterial activity, whereas unsaturated analogues, including oleic acid and linoleic acid, were active, with the latter being the most potent one (MIC of 2 \u03bcg/mL against M. aurum). However, these data do not provide convincing evidence for an antimycobacterial principle of P. sidoides. In traditional medicine decoctions and infusions are used, thus putting into question the presence of effective levels of lipophilic constituents in aqueous preparations. Furthermore, it should be noted that Mycobacteria are intracellularly residing pathogens, while the in vitro protocols conducted reflect a direct action on these pathogens. That P. sidoides root extracts apparently show limited antimycobacterial activity under these test conditions is reflected in further studies [24,25]. Taking into account the overall moderate antimycobacterial activity in experiments carried out so far, it is highly likely that the claimed effective use of P. sidoides in the treatment of tuberculosis may be due to stimulation of the non-specific immune system rather than any direct action on Mycobacteria pathogens. The antimycobacterial principle of this popular Pelargonium species remains to be identified.",

Inactivation of the trapped microorganisms may be explained by the fact that the decaying buccal cells are physiologically sloughed off and swallowed with the saliva. In this way the intercepted pathogens are not available for adhesion to intact cells. Taking into account the fairly high inhibition of bacterial adhesion to viable epithelial cells, these indirect antibacterial activities have beneficial effects on infectious conditions. The impact of EPs\u00ae 7630 on microbial adhesion was also demonstrated in studies with Helicobacter pylori [31,32]. Again, pre-treatment of fluorescent-labelled H. pylori with the P. sidoides extract inhibited the adherence to human gastric mucosa cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the underlying biologically active principle remains to be identified.

From a more medicinal viewpoint, inhibition of the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells protects the host from pathogens that evade host defences and antibiotic therapy.

            "text": "Since respiratory tract infections are frequently caused by viruses (> 90% of cases) [19], it is noteworthy that EPs\u00ae 7630 exhibited antiviral effects in a number of assays. For example, prominent cytoprotective effects were observed in a fibroblast-virus protection assay [34]. In this test model, supernatants of activated macrophages were transferred to a monolayer of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)- and IFN-sensitive murine L 929 fibroblasts (ML929F) before exposure to EMCV suspensions. IFN activity was assessed by observing the protection of ML929F against the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by infection with EMCV. The relative number of viable cells was determined spectrophotometrically using crystal violet as staining reagent for protected cells [35]. Antiviral protection was expressed in U/mL, defined as the reciprocal value of the supernatant dilution that would inhibit 50% of the CPE induced by EMCV in ML929F. These values were correlated with the IFN standard (100 U/mL) to account for any fluctuation in assay sensitivity. Prominent cytoprotective effects (ca. 60%) were observed for EPs\u00ae 7630 at remarkably low doses (0.8 \u03bcg/mL), with complete inhibition of CPE at 1.4 \u03bcg/mL sample concentration [34]. Recent refined work showed that the supernatant of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM\u03a6) stimulated with 10 \u03bcg/mL of EPs\u00ae 7630 produced an antiviral activity of ca. 80 U/mL, which was similar to that of the LPS (1 ng/mL) response [36]. Known antiviral factors are members of the IFN family classified in type I and type II interferons according to receptor specificity and sequence homology [37,38]. Since the functional assay does not discriminate between IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, the authors' interest focused on their detection using ELISA. All attempts to identify any potential antiviral compound were unsuccessful, suggesting that either the production of effective IFN levels was below the detection limits of the assays, synergistic effects may contribute to the powerful overall action or other elements of the immune system such as type III IFN [39] are the responsible effective agents. That eicosanoids may play a role in the control of viral infection may be excluded. EPs\u00ae 7630 was shown to suppress their production in calcium-ionophore stimulated human granulocytes [40]. Previous studies with a range of proanthocyanidins indicated that members of this class of compounds possess pronounced IFN-like activities [41]. Their presence in the extract may also be an inducing factor. Worthy of mention is that the extract did not induce any cytoprotective effects when directly exposed to ML929F, clearly indicating an indirect mode of action.",

Both herpes viruses cause common infections with recurrent orofacial (HSV-1) and genital lesions (HSV-2). Only pretreatment of viruses with the extract and subsequent infection of RC-37 cells revealed pronounced antiviral effects in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 0.6 \u03bcg/mL and 0.05 \u03bcg/mL for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Taking into account the excellent selectivity index defined as the ratio of IC50 values between the cytotoxicity on RC-37 cells (0.04 mg/mL) and the antiherpes activity, the antiviral effect is likely due to interactions between the virus and extract components which, however, remain to be identified. Notably, at the maximal noncytotoxic sample concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL, plaque formation was reduced by ca. 99.9% for HSV-1 and HSV-2. The mode of action was investigated by a set of experiments with incubation during the adsorption or replication period of the virus.

With the exception of coxsackie, all sensitive viruses are enveloped, suggesting that EPs\u00ae 7630 inhibits preferably the replication of viruses of this category. This was in line with the potential antiviral effects on enveloped herpes viruses [43]. In fact, EPs\u00ae 7630 did not show any influence on non-enveloped rhino- and adenoviruses-induced cytopathogenic effects. Observed varying susceptibilities to EPs\u00ae 7630 of influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H3N1, H5N1) can be rationalized by mutant haemagglutinins present on the surface of the individual influenza viruses.

In view of the claimed antiviral potential related to common colds, EPs\u00ae 7630 was originally tested for its in vitro neuraminidase inhibiting activity using a fluorometric-based assay [46]. Compared to zanamivir (IC50 of 71 \u03bcg/mL), the extract exhibited pronounced inhibitory activity for the bacterial neuraminidase from Vibrio cholera, with an IC50 value of 0.9 \u03bcg/mL [47]. The evidence, however, that EPs\u00ae 7630 has similar inhibiting activity for the viral neuraminidase in this in vitro model demands further investigation. Even more interesting, treatment of the extract with skin powder for the removal of tannins produced an inactive sample. The loss of activity of the polyphenol-free extract clearly indicated that proanthocyanidins apparently represent the underlying active principle. The specificity of EPs\u00ae 7630 polyphenols for this biological activity was demonstrated by testing a range of proanthocyanidin samples comprised of different flavanyl constituent units (procyanidins, prodelphinidins, A-type proanthocyanidins).The data suggested that the neuraminidase inhibiting activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 may be related to prodelphinidin extender units in oligoflavanoids.",

All NO synthases convert L-arginine and molecular oxygen to L-citrulline and NO. However, expression of iNOS in activated macrophages in response to immunological stimuli induces the release of large amounts of NO for long periods. Although NO species function beneficially as antimicrobial effector molecules in the immune protection against bacteria, parasites and viruses and regulate cell survival, the relatively high and sustained level of inducible NO produced during the immune response may be harmful, as dramatically shown in septic shock.

They act at all levels of the immune response and form a complex network of molecules. Among the macrophage-associated cytokines, release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 is an essential early step in a signalling cascade leading to production of antimicrobial NO [54,55]. Also, TNF-\u03b1 synergizes with IFN-\u03b3 in the induction of iNOS and NO production by macrophages, though IFN-\u03b3 alone was shown to be capable of independently enhancing iNOS transcription and NO release [56,57]. The role that these cytokines play in NO-mediated destruction of microbial pathogens prompted in the beginning exploration of Pelargonium-induced immune modulatory effects on macrophage functions using functional assays such as a fibroblast-lysis assay for release of TNF and a cytopathic effect inhibition assay for IFN-like properties (vide infra). Importantly, control of viruses is achieved through IFN-\u2329 and IFN-\u00df which are produced by host cells, while IFN-\u03b3 mediates macrophage activation.",

Using a whole blood-based, flow cytometric assay with Candida albicans as the target organism, EPs\u00ae 7630 significantly increased the number of phagocytosing cells (maximal enhanced by 56% after 2 min upon addition of 30 \u03bcg/mL of the extract sample) in a concentration-dependent manner.

The stimulation of the burst activity was still detectable even when all Candida organisms have already been ingested.

For safety reasons and convenience, an established in vitro model for infectious diseases was selected in which murine macrophages were infected with obligate intracellular Leishmania parasites rather than pathogenic Mycobacteria strains [60]. A colorimetric assay was used for assessing the activation of macrophages against the intracellular parasites, based on infection of macrophages in suspension culture, exposure to the Pelargonium extract, and lysis of the host cells with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [61]. Surviving Leishmania organisms were then quantitated by their conversion of yellow 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) into a blue formazan product. While Pelargonium extracts, including parent aqueous acetone and methanol extracts as well as organic fractions (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol), proved to be inactive against extracellular promastigote forms of Leishmania species, pronounced antileishmanial effects were observed against intracellular amastigotes that are of clinical and pharmacological importance, with EC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 3.3 \u03bcg/mL compared with that of 7.9 \u03bcg/mL for Pentostam\u00ae as positive control [60]. Confirmatory evidence was recently provided by fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis using transgenic L. major expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) [62]. This method has significant advantages over those involving counting parasites in microscopic preparations and the SDS lysis/MTT protocol. Treatment of infected BMM\u03a6 with EPs\u00ae 7630 resulted in a significant decrease of the intracellular GFP signal in a dose dependent manner and reaffirmed previous results concerning the activation of immune defence mechanisms but at single cell levels (Figure 4). That reduction of the parasite load was not due to general cytotoxicity followed from addition of propidium iodide before FACS measurement in order to discriminate dead (PI-positive cells< 10% in all experiments) from living cells. Exposure of infected cells to EPs\u00ae 7630 in combination with IFN-\u03b3 markedly enhanced the effects. For example, the combination of EPs\u00ae 7630 (10 \u03bcg/mL) plus IFN-\u03b3 (100 U/mL) was almost as effective as IFN-\u03b3 (100 U/mL) plus LPS (10 ng/mL) in killing intracellular parasites [36].",

That the immune response was considerably more expressed in infected cells suggests effective stimulation of the non-specific immune system when needed. Compared with the positive control (100 U/mL IFN-\u03b3 + 10 ng/mL LPS), the NO inducing potential of hydrophilic Pelargonium extracts was significantly less prominent. However, it should be noted that the induced NO production strongly depended on the kind of macrophages (BMM\u03a6; RAW 264.7) used in experimental models [63]. Inhibition of iNOS by addition of L-NMMA produced significantly lower NO levels and concomitantly increased the GFP signal, providing strong evidence for the crucial role of NO as toxic effector molecule in the host defence to microbial infections and the pronounced NO-inducing capabilities of EPs\u00ae 7630. Although a strong inverse correlation between NO production and parasite kill was observed, the involvement of additional NO-independent defence mechanisms cannot be ruled out.",

Conspicuously, NO production was already increased at an early time point post infection (6 h). Although the survival rate was not measured in this FACS-based assay due to non-availability of labelled L. monocytogenes organisms, an efficient elimination of the invading pathogens may be anticipated. The data suggest that EPs\u00ae 7630 induces NO release in a broad spectrum of infectious conditions and, importantly, in therapeutically relevant doses (\u2264 30 \u03bcg/mL). Accordingly, stimulation of the non-specific immune system may be anticipated for intracellular residing mycobacteria. Although this still remains to be demonstrated, the present data provide a clue for the claimed efficacy of this herbal medicine in the earlier treatment of tuberculosis and related diseases in traditional medicine.

Measurement of TNF-activity induced by the above mentioned Pelargonium extracts was therefore another important immunological parameter in the evaluation of the anti-infective potential of this herbal medicine. Initially, TNF-release was assessed in a functional assay [66], in which TNF-sensitive ML929F treated with supernatants of sample-activated BMM\u03a6 were rapidly lysed in its presence. Surviving cells incorporate crystal violet dye and their relative number was spectrophotometrically determined. At the concentration of \u2264 25 \u03bcg/mL, the ethyl acetate (ca. 20 U/mL) and the n-butanol phase (ca. 19 U/mL) were found to possess a moderate TNF-inducing potential. All remaining samples showed only a negligible effect (< 5 U/mL) compared to the LPS stimulus (10 ng/mL; 184 U/mL) as positive control [60]. Having in mind that systemic TNF can be fatal the moderate TNF-inducing capability of the Pelargonium extracts in non-infected cells may be beneficial. This functional bioassay has hitherto not been extended to infected macrophages. However, gene expression analysis clearly showed augmented and prolonged up-regulation of TNF- \u03b1 transcripts in infected cells (vide supra). Confirmatory evidence of increased intracellular TNF- \u03b1 levels induced by EPs\u00ae 7630 in infectious conditions compared to non-infected cells was recently obtained from FACS analysis at single cell levels [64]. Conspicuously, the accumulation of this membrane-bound cytokine in stimulated infected cells (ca. 35%) was less pronounced than that in untreated cultures (ca. 45%). This phenomenon may be explained by an enhanced activity of the TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme mediated by the herbal extract. This conjecture found support by increased soluble TNF-\u03b1 protein levels detected by ELISA in the supernatant of infected cells treated with EPs\u00ae 7630. The TNF-\u03b1 titers (ca. 10\u201316 ng/mL; EPs\u00ae 7630 test concentrations 1\u201330 \u03bcg/mL) were conspicuously above those of both the positive LPS control and infected cells (ca. 10 ng/mL in each case).",

CD40 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells including macrophages. This surface marker was found to be an important regulatory receptor for IFN-\u03b3 dependent and independent host defence mechanisms [76,77] and to be essential for the development of a CD4+ T cell mediated immune response [78]. Stimulation of non-infected and Listeria-infected BMM\u03a6 with EPs\u00ae 7630 moderately enhanced the expression of CD40 [63]. However, it was suggested that this herbal medicine may sustain up-regulated CD40 expression in infected conditions as concluded from prominent expressions at the very low concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL.",

The down-regulation of this receptor under infectious conditions was consistent with similar effects in L. monocytogenes infected BMM\u03a6 [79]. Changes in the expression of CD119 are suggested to affect the sensitivity of the cell in responding to IFN-\u03b3 [80]. These limited molecular studies do not allow definite statements, but, at the very least, they do provide encouragement for further study of the P. sidoides extract's mode of action in anti-infective assays.",

In addition to recruiting and activating other immune cells, PMNs have been demonstrated to release soluble peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity such as the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and the defensins, human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1\u20133. Recently EPs\u00ae 7630 was shown to enhance the release of these antimicrobial peptides in a concentration-dependent manner [81]. At 30 \u03bcg/mL EPs\u00ae 7630 increased the levels of HNP 1\u20133 and BPI by 150% and 127%, respectively. It should be noted that the extract was a much better inducer for the release of the defensins than LPS (82%, 10 ng/mL), whereas LPS proved to be more effective for BPI (356%). Interestingly, the combination of both stimuli enhanced the release of the studied antimicrobial peptides disproportionately (531% and 294% for BPI and HNP 1\u20133, respectively). This finding provided further evidence that the immune system reacts faster and most likely more effective against pathogens under the treatment of EPs\u00ae 7630 than in the absence of this herbal medicine.",

Recent chemical, pharmacological and clinical studies of a special extract, referred to as EPs\u00ae 7630 and developed from this traditional medicine, proved its efficacy in these conditions. Studying herbs such as P. sidoides for effects on the non-specific immune system may lead to the identification of novel chemical structures on which newer therapeutic agents can be derived and provide additional insight into the mode of action at the molecular level. This example provides a compelling argument for continuing the exploration of Nature and traditional medical systems as a source of therapeutically useful herbal medicines which satisfy current criteria of quality, safety and efficacy for an evidence-based therapy.",
