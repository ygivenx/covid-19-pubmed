This study divided the time series into two segments, pre- and post-intervention. We used segmented regression analysis to assess the longitudinal effect of the IDS-led ASP. Parameters used in segmented regression analysis were defined as follows. The level was considered the value of a measure at the beginning of a time segment. The trend was considered the rate of change for the measure during the given time interval. The level change after intervention was considered the average value of change after intervention, reflecting the immediate effect of the intervention. The trend change after intervention was considered to be the change in slope during the period after intervention, constituting a gradual change during the segment. The Durbin\u2013Watson statistic was used to test for the presence of autocorrelation, and we verified no serious autocorrelation.

Compared with the rate at this major teaching hospital, our current study demonstrated a similar usage rate of antibiotics in the NAC hospital. Other studies have also reported that hospital size is not important in predicting the amount of antibiotic use [18,19]. Given these findings, regardless of bed size or medical school affiliation, all hospitals should be required to implement ASPs. However, the majority of Korean NAC hospitals still do not have these programs because of insufficient human, financial, and information technology resources as compared with large, academic medical centers. For example, a pharmacist should be involved in an ASP; however, most Korean NAC hospitals do not have a staff member with drug expertise as one of the core elements for a successful hospital ASP [20]. In addition, although NAC hospitals do implement ASPs, there are barriers to the success of these programs. First, a large proportion of patients in NAC hospitals come from long-term care facilities; therefore, they are likely to suffer from recurrent aspiration pneumonia or severe decubitus ulcers, which result in an increased chance of antibiotic use [21]. Second, compared to in large academic hospitals, reducing antibiotic use, especially well-reimbursed drugs, may not be financially beneficial in NAC hospitals [12]. Therefore, ASPs may not be receiving sufficient support from hospital leadership.",

In this study, the use of 1st/2nd generation cephalosporins tended to increase after the intervention (coefficient 1.891, p = 0.061), although these results were not statistically significant.

In these studies, ASPs have also been proven to reduce antibiotic use, lower medical costs, and improve antibiotic susceptibilities to specific pathogens [24,25,26,27]. Even though IDSs spent much less time on the ASP than that in our study, they demonstrated successful results after implementation of ASP. However, key differences exist in our study compared to these other studies. First, most of the hospitals had pharmacists who were dedicated to the ASP and facilitated the intervention, but we did not have a pharmacist as a member of the ASP team because of the lack of available pharmacists in Korean NAC hospitals. Second, it takes less time to develop and maintain an ASP in smaller hospitals. Stenehjem et al. [12] reported that the average time spent on the ASP is 5\u201310 hours per week in hospitals with 70\u2013150 beds. In contrast, in our study the IDS was required to work full time in the hospital, which has 402 beds, and dedicate the most time to ASP activities. In addition, a low volume of patients and staff members means that once IDS-led ASPs are well established in smaller NAC hospitals, we can expect more rapid effects and better compliance than in larger NAC hospitals. Therefore, we think that this study, conducted in moderate-sized, resource-limited NAC hospital, is worthwhile.",
