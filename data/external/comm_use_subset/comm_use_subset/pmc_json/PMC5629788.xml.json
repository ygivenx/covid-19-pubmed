The majority of FCoV infections are asymptomatic or are associated with mild intestinal disease. However, an estimated 1 to 5% of infected cats develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [3, 4], characterised by the development of a variable combination of pyogranulomatous polyserositis, vasculitis and granulomatous lesions in organs, and an extremely high mortality rate [5, 6]. Avirulent or self-limiting FCoV infection was believed to be confined to the intestines, but we now know that healthy FCoV-infected cats can have systemic FCoV infection, albeit with lower FCoV viral loads than cats with FIP [7\u201310].",

As IHC requires an invasive sampling procedure, and has significant cost and time implications, alternative diagnostic techniques have been investigated, such as detection of FCoV and characterisation of FCoV genomic sequences, using pyrosequencing, Sanger sequencing or sequence specific hydrolysis probes. Recent studies have identified mutations in the gene encoding spike (S) protein of serotype 1 FCoVs that are implicated in monocyte/macrophage tropism [18]. Two amino acid substitutions, M1058L and/or S1060A corresponding to nucleotide mutations 23531A>T/C and 23537T>G respectively in the S gene, together distinguished FCoVs found in the tissues of FIP cats from those found in the faeces of healthy cats without FIP in > 95% of cases. A subsequent study, which compared detection of FCoV by RT-qPCR alone to detection of FCoV by RT-qPCR combined with sequence analysis to confirm the presence of nucleotide mutations 23531A>T/C and 23537T>G, concluded that the addition of an assay for S gene mutation analysis did not alter the specificity of the FIP diagnosis, which was already 100%, but did decrease the sensitivity from 9.4 to 6.3% for serum/plasma samples and from 72 to 64% for effusion samples [19]. However, we have shown that the nucleotide mutations 23531A>T/C and 23537T>G are likely to be markers of systemic FCoV infection rather than FIP per se, being present in 91% of the FCoV-positive tissue samples from cats with FIP and 89% of the FCoV-positive tissue samples from cats without FIP [20].",

Overall, however, FCoV RT-qPCR was more sensitive (89.7% vs. 62.1%; calculated from Table 4) than IHC at detecting FCoV in tissues from cats with FIP. Therefore, not surprisingly, to maximise the sensitivity of both IHC and RT-qPCR at detecting FCoV in cats with FIP, biopsies should be collected from tissues with imaging changes or gross visual changes consistent with granulomata, and from lesion sites, whenever possible. Distribution of granulomatous lesions within a tissue, and virus laden macrophages within a lesion, is not uniform, which could account for the failure to detect viral antigen in some FIP lesions, and the negative FCoV RT-qPCR result in some cats in which the combined histological and IHC examination confirmed FIP. However, application of the calculated sensitivity to suspect FIP cases has to be viewed with caution, as not all samples included in the study were selected on the basis of clinical signs and gross pathological changes. In contrast, 10% of tissue samples from cats without FIP had a positive FCoV RT-qPCR result even though there were neither histological changes consistent with FIP nor was there evidence of viral antigen expression in tissue macrophages by IHC, resulting in a specificity of 90% for FCoV RT-qPCR, as compared to 100% for the reference standard of IHC. Persistence of FCoV in both intestinal and extraintestinal tissue macrophages in the absence of disease has been reported in healthy cats experimentally infected with FCoV, albeit with authors reporting IHC to be a relatively insensitive method of FCoV detection compared with RT-qPCR [7].",

The other study evaluated the use of RT-qPCR for the diagnosis of FIP, where the sensitivity was 42%, but specificity was 100 percent [29]. The results of the latter study are comparable with those of the current study (sensitivity 50%; specificity 100%). However, the apparent effect of the site of cerebrospinal fluid collection on diagnostic sensitivity of FCoV infection warrants further investigation. In cats with FIP there may be concern that some clinical signs could relate to increased intracranial pressure, where lumbar sampling could provide lower risk of herniation cf. cisternal sampling; however, FIP lesions rarely go beyond the leptomeninges of the brain stem (unpublished results).",

In the 2 of the 3 cats where faeces were available for testing there was no detectable viral shedding. In 1 cat the FCoV was non-mutated, another cat had mutated FCoV, and in the remaining cat mixed non-mutated and mutated FCoV was detected. Of note, the cat with pyothorax also had non-mutated virus detected at a low level in its brain, and mutated virus detected at low level in its liver, suggesting that it was viraemic at the time of death and that the virus persisted not only in the colon but also in extraintestinal tissue macrophages [7]. If colonic tissue samples are excluded, all but one tissue sample from the non-FIP cats that were FCoV RT-qPCR-positive for which sequence data were available (n = 13) had mutated FCoV, confirming our previous findings that S gene mutations are a marker of systemic spread [20].",

FCoV RT-qPCR assays amplify both cell-associated subgenomic mRNA, as well as cell-associated or virion-associated genomic RNA, with relative abundance determined by the positioning of primers. As viral transcription starts at the 3\u2032 end of the FCoV genome there are more subgenomic mRNAs containing viral 3\u2032 sequence than those containing viral 5\u2032 sequence, hence assays directed at the 5\u2032 end of the genome (e.g. viral replicase complex genes) are less susceptible to viral load overestimation than those directed at the 3\u2032 end of the genome (e.g. 7a/b accessory protein genes). The RT-qPCR assay used in the present study targets the region spanning the membrane-nucleocapsid gene junction (nucleotides positions 26655\u201326826 of FCoV isolate FIPV 79\u20131146 DQ010921) [24]. Overestimation is less of an issue in the faecal samples, firstly as faeces has a high level of bacteria, and is thus rich in RNases that would degrade any RNA released from cells shed into the gut lumen, and secondly as the viral RNA is most likely to be present in its virion form, which does not contain subgenomic mRNA and is protected from RNase degradation by the viral envelope. Any cell-associated viral RNA is likely to be degraded due to cell death and the abundant RNases. This study did not determine whether any faecally shed FCoV was infective; this is an important concept as faeces containing mutated FCoV theoretically has increased potential to cause FIP following faeco\u2013oral transmission, assuming the mutated virus can enter enterocytes and replicate. Previous studies have reported 39\u201385% of FCoVs detected in tissues from cats with FIP had loss of 3c gene functionality [33\u201335], which has been associated with a loss of ability to replicate in enterocytes and therefore infectivity via the natural route [35, 36]. Enterocyte cell cultures have been used to more accurately assess FCoV infectivity and virus copy number in a recent study [8]. However, use of enterocyte cell cultures was not possible in this study, nor was 3c gene sequencing attempted.",

We were not able to obtain pyrosequencing data in all samples; this was attributed to low relative FCoV copy number, failure of amplification primer binding, or failure of pyrosequencing primers to bind to viral cDNA as a result of sequence mismatches. Conventional sequencing of the pyrosequencing amplicon was possible in 21 cases in which pyrosequencing failed (n = 48 of 320 samples where pyrosequencing was attempted), significant secondary structure was predicted in these amplicons at the pyrosequencing primer binding site, which could account for the failure to pyrosequence [26]. Mixed non-mutated and mutated FCoV infections may also have been missed by the pyrosequencing assay as the amplification step biases the detected sequence towards the dominant virus type. In addition, both serotype 1 and serotype 2 FCoVs have been associated with the development of FIP; however, only mutations within the S protein fusion peptide of the more prevalent serotype 1 FCoVs have been associated with systemic infection and development of FIP [18, 20]. As the recombination events that result in the formation of serotype 2 FCoVs include the S protein gene, assays that characterise this portion of the genome are not applicable to serotype 2 FCoVs. Therefore, it was predicted that pyrosequencing would fail for those samples containing serotype 2 FCoV; however, both serotype 1 and 2 FCoVs were detected by the RT-qPCR assay used in this study, as this assay targets a section of the genome not affected by the recombination events [24]. In this study only cats that failed pyrosequencing were assessed for the presence of serotype 2 FCoVs, therefore it cannot be excluded that more cats had a dual infection with both serotypes. Spike gene mutation analysis, in combination with FCoV RT-qPCR, results in a modest increase in specificity, but this is offset by a decrease in sensitivity resulting in decreased accuracy. Independent of disease prevalence within a population, there was no significant difference in the proportion of mutated FCoVs detected in tissue and body cavity fluid samples between cats with FIP and cats without FIP that were FCoV RT-qPCR-positive (\u03c72 = 2.96, p = 0.086). Overall, the combination of FCoV RT-qPCR and S protein mutation analysis does not enhance the diagnosis of FIP over FCoV RT-qPCR alone, and S gene mutation analysis has significant time and cost implications.",

            "text": "It has been previously proposed that the M1058L or S1060A substitutions could affect the fusogenic activity and cell receptor specificity of the FCoV S protein [18, 20], permitting entry into macrophages and monocytes. It is further proposed that additional FCoV mutations, along with changes within the host\u2019s immunological response, are required to permit the seemingly uncontrolled replication seen during the development of FIP. These hypotheses are supported by the present study: firstly, the finding that the majority of FCoV detected in tissue samples from both cats with FIP and cats without FIP have M1058L or S1060A substitutions in the FCoV S protein; and secondly, as also described in a previous study of naturally infected cats [10], the finding that FCoV RNA was detected in a far greater proportion of tissue samples from cats with FIP (90.4%) than tissue samples from cats without FIP (7.8%), and, in those samples that were RT-qPCR positive, significantly higher FCoV relative copy numbers were found in the FIP samples (median 8.3 \u00d7 103 vs. 25; U = 2161.5, p \u2264 0.001). Other viral genomic mutations have also been associated with FIP, but were not evaluated as part of this study. For example, mutations in the S protein gene encoding amino acid differences in the furin cleavage motif [37] and the heptad HR1 region of the S2 subunit [38] have been correlated with disease. Truncations of the accessory protein 3c gene have also been associated with loss of ability to replicate within enterocytes and, as such, have only been reported in FIP-associated FCoVs [35]. However, characterisation of these viral genomic mutations was not within the aims of this study, and use of these viral genomic mutations in the diagnosis of FIP has, so far, not been suggested.",

However, a number of other studies have examined the use of immunocytochemistry on fluid in the diagnosis of FIP [30, 39], and reported similar sensitivities for the diagnosis of FIP to the FCoV RT-qPCR used in this study, but observed increased false positive results resulting in reduced specificities. However, in our experience, false positive results are not a relevant issue, provided sufficient cell numbers can be examined; this can be achieved when cells are concentrated in cytospins or when fluids are used to prepare formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded cell pellets that can then be treated like a tissue specimen for IHC (unpublished observations; Anja Kipar) [5].

            "text": "The University of Bristol FIP Biobank cats included in this study represent a convenience population, including cats for which FIP was not necessarily a differential diagnosis, and cats for which the samples available do not necessarily reflect clinical signs reported and, as such, clinically relevant samples of tissues essential for a definitive diagnosis may not be included. Differences between the cats with FIP and cats without FIP in this convenience population are clearly demonstrated when age at diagnosis is compared, which reflects the diseases for which these cats were euthanased, with neoplasia being the most common reason for euthanasia in the significantly older cats without FIP. This significant difference in the age could complicate comparison of faecal FCoV shedding between each clinical group (20% for non-FIP vs. 64.6% for FIP group), as younger cats are more likely to have been recently exposed to factors that could increase likelihood of enteric FCoV infection such as multicat households (i.e. breeding cattery or rehoming shelter). One study found FCoV shedding was most common in young cats (90% in cats aged 8\u201356 weeks cf. 39% for cats > 56 weeks) [1]; however, another study of faecal FCoV shedding found no difference between different age categories (34.6% < 1 year of age, 31.6% 1\u20135 years, and 35.3% > 5 years) [40]. Ideally the cats without FIP would have been age and clinical sign matched to the cats with FIP; however, this was not possible and is generally very difficult to achieve in an unbiased clinical patient cohort. Previous case-controlled studies of FIP have either not reported age of either FIP or control cat populations [29, 31, 41], or recruited healthy control cats [42]. One advantage of the increased age in the cats without FIP is that it does imply that these cats would be unlikely to have gone on to develop FIP had their concurrent disease not resulted in euthanasia. The absence of clinically relevant samples of tissue for some cats resulted in their exclusion from analysis, as a definitive diagnosis could not be achieved.",
