However, infections remain a major global health concern, particularly in the developing world [2], where the human immunodeficiency virus and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), viral hepatitis, tuberculosis and malaria, still kill millions of people around the globe every year [3, 4]. Parasitic diseases, e.g., malaria and schistosomiasis, do not always remain limited to their age-old geographic distributions complicating control efforts and challenging the progress towards their elimination [5\u20138]. Additionally, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, Ebola virus disease (EVD), dengue, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Zika virus disease threaten human health and global security [9\u201318].",

In a global perspective, this leads to huge economic losses, both for the individual and society, and a global platform to communicate and share the research on the infectious diseases of poverty was felt to be needed to facilitate the translation of knowledge into effective approaches and tools for the elimination of these diseases.",

Its preferential aims are to identify and assess research and information gaps that hinder progress towards new interventions for public health problems, in particular those connected with poverty in the developing world. Based on the \u201cOne health, One world\u201d mission mentioned in the Global Report on Research for the Infectious Diseases of Poverty [21], the journal publishes work on topics and approaches that address essential public health questions related to this issue. Along with the actions proposed by this report, IDP, aims to achieve the goal of improving research capacity and create a better environment for the research on the infectious diseases of poverty [19, 22].",

Table 4 presents the 10 most highly cited publications, which includes five reviews, two editorials, one opinion article, one research article and one letter to the editor. Interestingly, the most highly cited publication in IDP is an editorial published in 2013 [25], which may be explained by the fact that it dealt with surveillance and response defining this approach as a research priority during the stage moving towards elimination of tropical diseases, which received much global attention [26\u201330]. The importance and significance of the surveillance and response approach are also highlighted by two other highly cited publications in IDP [26, 31]. We refer here to two reviews, one discussing gap analysis of the Chinese three major tropical diseases (schistosomiasis, malaria and echinococcosis), and the other assessing the morbidity due to schistosomiasis japonica in China [32, 33]. In addition, an editorial opinion focusing on the Chinese schistosomiasis control and health systems and a research article reporting on Babesia microti and Plasmodium co-infections along the China-Myanmar border were also commonly cited [34, 35]. Among three other publications, which have been cited 26 times and more, are two reviews describing global epidemiology: the burden of infectious diseases of poverty [2] and that of clonorchiasis [36], together with an editorial introducing the mission, aims and scope of IDP [37].\n",

They include three research articles, one focusing on the interplay between infectious disease emergence and global climate change [38], one dealing with the risk factors of malaria among pregnant women in Nigeria [39] and one discussing the reaction of Chinese social media to the outbreaks caused by the MERS coronavirus and avian influenza A (H7N9) [40]. Two reviews, one on tuberculosis [40] and the other on malaria and other vector-borne protozoan diseases [41] were also often downloaded. Interestingly, the most highly accessed publication is a research article exploring the potential correlation between the emergence of infectious diseases and global climate change, perhaps explained by the currently worldwide focus on a large number of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in this context [42, 43].\n",
