G1a includes historic PEDV isolates such as CV777 and attenuated variants distributed in Europe and Asia, whilst G1b includes the so called S-INDEL strains which can be found in Europe, Asia and North America. G2a isolates are restricted to Asia whereas G2b isolates are present in Asia and the Ukraine [9], and since US introduction in 2013 are widespread in the US and considered the US prototype [8, 10]. Differences in pathogenicity between representative isolates of different genogroups have been demonstrated [10\u201312], with G2b isolates usually being more pathogenic compared to G1b isolates. Partial cross-protection between PEDV G1b and G2b isolates has been demonstrated experimentally [12].",

While the use of these vaccines is often beneficial in previously exposed herds, they often fail in na\u00efve herds [14]. One reason for the variable vaccine efficacy observed under field conditions may be the usage of inactivated vaccines given intramuscularly rather than live virus vaccines given orally to induce a strong local enteric immunity. It would be risky to use a known pathogenic G2b live vaccine virus in a pig population; however, using a less virulent variant such as G1b instead may be safe and efficacious.",

All groups were fed ad libitum with a balanced, age-appropriate, pelleted feed ration. At 3 weeks of age or dpv 0, EXP-IM-1b, EXP-ORAL-1b and VAC-IM-2b groups were vaccinated with different vaccines and routes as outlined in Table 1, whereas POS-CONTROL and NEG-CONTROL pigs were sham-vaccinated with saline. VAC-IM-2b pigs were revaccinated at 5 weeks of age (dpv 14). At day post-challenge (dpc) 0 or dpv 28, when the pigs were 7 weeks old, they were challenged as shown in Table 1.

Half of the pigs in each group were necropsied at dpv 31/dpc 3 and the remainder at dpv 42/dpc 14. The experimental design and sample collection details are summarized in Figure 1. Blood was collected in serum separator tubes on a weekly basis (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, and the serum was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until testing. Rectal swabs were collected at dpv 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 followed by daily collection until dpv 41/dpc 13 using polyester swabs and stored in 5 mL plastic tubes containing 1 mL of sterile saline solution at \u221280 \u00b0C until testing.

After cell culture adaption this virus was used to infect 5-day old pigs previously and had reduced pathogenicity compared to G2b isolates [10]. For the intramuscular vaccination, 2 mL of the G1b virus stock with a titer of 5 \u00d7 104 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL was mixed with 0.4 mL Adjuplex\u2122 vaccine adjuvant (Lot Number SLBP5255 V; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) prior to injection. The same G1b cell culture adapted virus stock used in this study has been shown to have moderate to severe enteric pathogenicity in 5-day old pigs [10]. Each pig in the EXP-IM-1b group received 2.4 mL intramuscularly into the neck, with a total PEDV dose of 1 \u00d7 105 TCID50. For the oral vaccination route, each EXP-ORAL-1b pig was administered 10 mL of the G1b virus stock with a titer of 6.8 \u00d7 103 TCID50 per mL by slowly dripping the vaccine into the mouth of each pig with a total dose of 6.8 \u00d7 104 TCID50.

            "text": "Pig veterinarians and producers often prefer intramuscular administration to assure each pig gets vaccinated with the appropriate dose. Intramuscular administration is known to induce a systemic immune response [22]. In this study, VAC-IM-2b pigs had a strong anti-PEDV IgG response in serum which was significantly higher compared to EXP-ORAL-1b pigs. This could be due to the adjuvant Amphigen\u00ae used in the commercial product or due to the booster dose that the VAC-IM-2b pigs received. In contrast to live virus exposure, inactivated vaccines are almost always given in 2 dose regimens; hence in this study the VAC-IM-G2b group received a booster dose whereas the EXP-IM-G1b and EXP-ORAL-G1b pigs did not. In contrast to oral exposure to a live virus, pigs vaccinated with the commercial inactivated virus had a weak anti-IgA response in serum and no anti-PEDV IgA response in feces. This is not surprising as inactivated vaccines often do not induce effective mucosal immunity in na\u00efve pigs whereas oral exposure elicits better gut immunity [22]. It has been shown that IgA levels in serum correlates with IgA measured in feces from experimentally infected piglets [18] and in serum and colostrum and milk samples of sows orally immunized [13]. These studies indicate that measuring IgA levels in serum samples may be a marker of protection.",

However, for some viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), it has been shown that inactivated vaccines are largely ineffective [23]. PRRSV requires live virus to migrate to the lung and replicate at low levels to induce protection. Similarly, PEDV may also require local activation of the gut-associated mucosal system. In Asia, where PEDV vaccines have been available for decades, attenuated G1a-based intramuscular vaccines are commonly used [4, 24]. We attempted to inject a G1b isolate intramuscularly with an adjuvant. Under the study conditions, except for 2/7 EXP-IM-1b pigs with low levels of PEDV RNA in rectal swabs at 7 dpv, there was no sign of infection in this group based on lack of seroconversion and lack of detectable PEDV RNA in serum or feces. The two PEDV RNA positive EXP-IM-1b samples were retested and results confirmed (data not shown).",

Viral titers to determine infectivity were not determined, but it has been shown previously that contact pigs can be infected for up to 14 days after initial infection of a seeder pig group [25]. In this study a homologous G1b challenge for pigs vaccinated with the experimental G1b live vaccine was not included due to space and cost reasons. In addition, G2b isolates, considered to be more pathogenic compared to G1b isolates [10, 12], appear to be the primary cause of clinical disease associated with PEDV under field conditions and are more widely distributed compared to G1b isolates. Pigs orally vaccinated with an experimental heterologous G1b live vaccine had a tendency for a shortened viral shedding duration; whereas pigs vaccinated intramuscularly with an experimental heterologous G1b live vaccine were not protected. It has been shown that piglets orally inoculated with a virulent CV777 strain were fully protected after challenge, while protection was not complete in pigs orally inoculated with an attenuated CV777 strain [26]. Prior to usage the G1b stock was passaged seven times which could have resulted in a low degree of attenuation. It is worth noting that pigs orally immunized with the G1b live vaccine presented mild diarrhea and shed high levels of virus for at least 2 weeks after immunization. This could pose risks of infection and potentially more serious clinical signs in younger piglets.",

A previous study showed that although G1a-based vaccines (CV777 and DR13 strains) could provide protection against homologous challenge, they were not protective against contemporary Chinese G2b strain YC2014 [27]. It has been suggested that sows naturally-infected with a G1b strain produce heterologous lactogenic protective immunity against G2b strains 7 months after initial infection [28]. However, infection of 3\u20134 day old piglets with G1b strain provided variable protection against a G2b challenge 21\u201329 days later and the extent of protection was shown to be litter-dependent (mortality 0 to 75%) [12]. Additionally, the antigen concentration in the commercial (106\u2013108 TCID50/dose) and experimental (104\u2013105 TCID50/dose) intramuscular vaccines may have contributed to differences in the protection observed in the current study.
