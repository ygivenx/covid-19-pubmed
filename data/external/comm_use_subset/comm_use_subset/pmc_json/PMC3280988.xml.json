            "text": "All eukaryotic plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses have similar replication cycles in infected cells. After translation of their mRNA-sense genomic RNA(s), the viral RNA and the viral replication proteins are recruited to the site of viral replication in membranous compartments. After the assembly of the membrane-bound viral replicase complexes (VRC), the viral replicase uses the viral RNA as a template to produce complementary (\u2212)RNA. This is then followed by (+)-strand synthesis in an asymmetric manner, producing excess amounts of (+)-strand progeny, which is released from replication for other viral processes. For efficient replication, (+)RNA viruses recruit numerous host proteins [1]\u2013[5]. Among the identified host proteins are RNA-binding proteins, such as translation factors, ribosomal proteins and RNA-modifying enzymes [1]. The co-opted host proteins likely affect several steps in viral RNA replication, including the assembly of the replicase complex and/or viral RNA synthesis. However, the functions of host factors in (+)RNA virus replication are known only for a small number of host factors [1]\u2013[9].",

Although the functions of several of these proteins have been studied in some details, additional host proteins might be also present in tombusvirus VRC [5], [10], [21]\u2013[23], [25]. One of the intriguing questions is if tombusviruses use host-coded helicases for their replication. This is because, unlike larger RNA viruses, the tombusvirus genome does not code for a protein with helicase function. Thus, can tombusviruses and other small RNA viruses replicate without the use of a helicase or they subvert a cellular helicase(s) to assist their replication?",

It is involved in initiation of translation of every yeast mRNA [37]\u2013[39] and down-regulation of Ded1p level also reduced p33 and p92 levels in yeast [20].

We define that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand (+)RNA synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus VRC and binds to the 3\u2032-end of the viral minus-stranded (\u2212)RNA. The obtained data support the model that Ded1p unwinds the 3\u2032-end of the TBSV (\u2212)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and GAPDH play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (\u2212)RNA and the replication proteins.",

To circumvent this problem, we used whole cell extracts (CFE) prepared from yeast containing reduced level of Ded1p (Figure S1) to support cell-free TBSV replication. As we have shown previously, TBSV (+)RNA can perform one complete cycle of replication in the CFE-based replication assay when purified recombinant p33 and p92pol replication proteins are provided [23], [40]. The CFE-based replication assay showed that both (+) and (\u2212)RNA synthesis decreased by over 4-fold when Ded1p was down-regulated as compared with the control CFE prepared from yeast with high level of Ded1p expression (Figure S1, lanes 4\u20136 versus 1\u20133). Thus, these data confirm that Ded1p is important for TBSV replication. However, the observed decrease in the CFE-based TBSV replication could be due to either reduced replication when Ded1p is limiting (direct effect) or lesser amounts of other critical host factors needed for TBSV replication in the CFE with reduced level of Ded1p (indirect effect due to Ded1p's role in host translation). To address these points, we first studied if Ded1p is present within the tombusvirus replicase and then, what is the mechanistic role of Ded1p during TBSV RNA synthesis.",

Since Ded1p is an RNA helicase [39], [41] and the ATPase/helicase function of Ded1p is needed for stimulation of (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus and FHV replicases, we wanted to examine if Ded1p might facilitate RNA synthesis on a partial DNA/RNA duplex. We chose partial duplex for this assay, since Ded1p and other DEAD-box helicases are not processive enzymes and can only unwind short duplexes [34]. Also, we have shown previously that short DNA oligos hybridized to the promoter region of (\u2212)RNA can inhibit (+)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus replicase in vitro\n[42], [47], [48]. Interestingly, addition of purified Ded1p to the tombusvirus replicase assay containing the short RNA/DNA duplex (Figure 7A) enhanced (+)RNA synthesis by \u223c70% (Figure 7B, lane 2 versus 1). Similarly, Ded1p also promoted (+)RNA synthesis by the FHV replicase using the same RNA/DNA duplex (Figure 7C, lane 2 versus 1). D1 ATPase deficient mutant could not stimulate RNA synthesis on the RNA/DNA duplex by tombusvirus or FHV replicases (Figure 7B\u2013C, lane 3). Thus, the ATPase/helicase function of Ded1p is needed for the stimulatory effect on RNA synthesis on a short RNA/DNA duplex, suggesting that RNA unwinding by the Ded1p is a function provided by this host factor.",

While Ded1p mostly stimulated de novo (+)RNA synthesis initiated from the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212)repRNA up to \u223c3-fold (Figure 8B, lane 6), Tdh2p enhanced both de novo (+)RNA synthesis and 3\u2032TEX by \u223c2- and \u223c3-fold, respectively (Figure 8B, lane 7). Interestingly, the two host proteins together had the largest (4.5-fold) effect on (+)RNA synthesis, while their effect on 3\u2032TEX was only \u223c2-fold. Based on these data, we suggest that Ded1p and Tdh2p have a synergistic effect on (+)RNA synthesis by promoting de novo initiation from the 3\u2032 end of the (\u2212)RNA template.",

For example, AtRH20 has been shown to boost TBSV (+)RNA synthesis in vitro (Figure 6) and bind to p33 replication protein (Figure S6A), which can facilitate its recruitment into the VRC. Since more than 50 RNA helicases are present in plants, further experiments will be needed to define if additional host helicases might also be involved in TBSV replication.",

The ATPase activity of Ded1p is required for this stimulatory effect, suggesting that the helicase function of Ded1p is likely important for unwinding the secondary structure of (\u2212)RNA template with the purified tombusvirus replicase or destabilizing the replication intermediate with the membrane-bound VRC, which might contain dsRNA structure. This function of Ded1p can explain why yeast with down-regulated Ded1p level produced small amount of (+)-stranded RNA progeny, albeit it has also shown that depleted Ded1p reduced the level of p33/p92 in yeast [20]. However, the decreased p33/p92 levels are expected to reduce both (+) and (\u2212)RNA levels [55] (Figure S1). Since the recombinant Ded1p enhanced (+)-strand synthesis by the purified recombinant tombusvirus replicase, we propose that Ded1p directly affect TBSV RNA synthesis via affecting the structure of the RNA templates. However, we cannot exclude that Ded1p could also affect the activity of the VRC due to its interaction with p33, albeit the assembly of the VRC was not affected by Ded1p in the CFE-based assay (Figure 3). Overall, the recruitment of a host DEAD-box helicase for replication of a small RNA virus is remarkable, since RNA viruses with less than 6 kB genomes are usually do not code for their own helicases [51]. These viruses are thought to replicate without needing a helicase by using RNA chaperones or possibly recruiting host helicases. The emerging picture with TBSV is that this virus utilizes both the viral-coded p33 RNA chaperone [48] and the host Ded1p helicase for replication by promoting (+)-strand synthesis. Both p33 and Ded1p have been shown to open up short DNA/RNA duplexes, although the activity of Ded1p was more robust than that of p33 in vitro\n[48]. Why would TBSV utilize both an RNA chaperone and an RNA helicase? It is possible that both proteins are needed for robust (+)RNA synthesis to make excess amount of progeny RNA. Also, Ded1p helicase could be involved in remodeling the viral RNA bound by the viral RdRp or host proteins prior or during RNA synthesis. Since Ded1p can work in both 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 and 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 directions [56], it could be used for multiple purposes during RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Based on the available data, it seems that TBSV (+)RNA synthesis is not only affected by the p33/p92 replication proteins, but by GAPDH and Ded1p host proteins as well. Since the viral replication proteins were shown to bind to TBSV (\u2212)RNA nonspecifically [57], we propose that the above host proteins, which bind strongly to the TBSV (\u2212)repRNA, are involved in facilitating the proper and efficient recruitment of the p92 RdRp protein to the (\u2212)RNA template (or alternatively to the dsRNA intermediate) within the VRC as shown in Figure 9. For example, Ded1p might unwind either local secondary structure in (\u2212)repRNA or dsRNA region and that, in turn, could favor binding of GAPDH or p92 to the (\u2212)RNA template. This is followed by binding of GAPDH to an AU-rich internal site and proper positioning of the p92 RdRp (bound to GAPDH, [50]) over the (+)-strand initiation promoter, leading to (+)RNA synthesis. The synergistic effect of these host proteins could promote efficient recycling of the viral RdRp resulting in multiple rounds of (+)RNA synthesis (Figure 9). Thus, the roles of these host proteins are to serve as \u201cmatchmakers\u201d between the viral RNA template and the viral RdRp. It is intriguing that two host proteins, eEF1A and eEF1B\u03b3, are proposed to serve somewhat similar functions during (\u2212)RNA initiation for TBSV [27], [29]. Therefore, the emerging picture is that TBSV utilizes different host proteins for promoting (\u2212) versus (+)RNA synthesis. This strategy could be beneficial for the virus by allowing asymmetric RNA synthesis, thus leading to excess amount of progeny (+)RNA.",

The CNV p33 protein has very high sequence identity with the closely related TBSV p33, but the CNV p33 is expressed better and more active in yeast than TBSV p33. Recombinant yeast Tdh2p protein was produced in E. coli as GST fusion using plasmid pGEX-TDH2, described earlier [50]. Recombinant Ded1p helicase proteins were produced in E. coli as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusions [48]. The expression plasmid pMal-DED1 was prepared by PCR using primers #3956 (CCAGCTGCAGTCACCACCAAGAAGAGTTG)/ #3957(CCAGGAATTCATGGCTGAACTGAGCGAACAAG) and the yeast genomic DNA as a template. The plasmids pMal-Dx, expressing different Ded1p mutants, were prepared by PCR using #3956/ #3957 primers and plasmids containing mutated DED1 sequences [41], [53]. The PCR products obtained from DED1 wt and mutant sequences were digested with EcoRI and PstI and inserted between EcoRI and PstI sites in pMalc-2\u00d7 (New England Biolab).",

The extract was then centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min, followed by incubation with amylose resin (NEB) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. After washing the resin 2 times with the column buffer, the proteins were eluted with column buffer containing 0.18% (V/W) maltose. Purification of GST-tagged TDH2 (pGEX-TDH2) [50] was carried out using glutathione resin and eluted with 10 mM glutathione, 10 mM \u00df-mercaptoethanol in the column buffer following the same protocol as MBP-proteins. Eluted proteins were aliquoted for storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein fractions used for the replication assays were at least 95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE (not shown).
