Clinical studies have further shown that the AGR2 protein is overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, including carcinomas of the esophagus, pancreas, breast, prostate, and lung [2]\u2013[6]. More biological studies in these cancer cell lines have indicated a significant role for AGR2 in tumor-associated pathways, including tumor growth, cellular transformation, cell migration, limb regeneration, and metastasis [5], [7]\u2013[9]. However, the general biochemical functions of AGR2 in human cells remain undefined, and the signaling mechanisms that drive AGR2 to inhibit p53 are still not clearly illustrated [10]. Therefore, the development of molecular ligands specifically recognizing AGR2 is of great significance to early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and to fundamental research for the elucidation of the biochemical functions of AGR2.",

More recently, another type of molecular ligand, named aptamer, has drawn significant attention. Aptamers, single-stranded modified or unmodified oligonucleotides (RNA or DNA), are generated through in vitro selection process or SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) with high binding affinity and specificity towards defined targets [14], [15]. The selected aptamers can recognize a wide variety of targets, including small molecules, proteins, cells and tissues relying on their diverse tertiary structures. Compared to antibodies, aptamers have low molecular weight, fast tissue penetration rate, high stability and low immunogenesis [16]. They can be chemically synthesized with low cost and modified easily with various reporters [17]. Furthermore, they can be ligated and/or amplified by enzymes in vitro\n[18]. These advantages make aptamers promising ligands for medical and pharmaceutical research, such as drug development, disease diagnosis, and targeted therapy [19].",

            "text": "The possibilities provided by aptamers are enormous, and some aptamers have already shown many important applications in bioanalysisand biomedicine [20]\u2013[23]. Particularly, several aptamers have been generated against cancer-related proteins, such as PDGF, VEGF, HER3, NFkB, tenascin-C, or PMSA [24]\u2013[26]. Many aptameric sensors, probes and assays have been developed to allow sensitive and selective detection of these cancer biomarker proteins [27]. For instance, Yang et al has reported a light-switching excimer aptamer probes for sensitive quantitative detection of PDGF in cell media [28]. Kwon et al have developed a functionalized polypyrrole nanotube with aptamer to build a VEGF biosensor [29]. Aptamers have also been applied for molecular imaging to in vivo characterize the complex pathogenic activities that accompany tumor growth for disease early diagnosis and pathogenesis measurement [30]\u2013[33]. Since the targets for aptamers could be intracellular, extracellular or cell-surface biomolecules, various therapeutic methods have been developed using the aptamers as targeting reagents [34]\u2013[37], which greatly broaden the range of targeted therapy. In addition, some therapeutically useful aptamers have been found to inhibit protein\u2013protein interactions, such as receptor\u2013ligand interactions, and thereby function as antagonists [38].",

Beads-based SELEX allowed the use of simple, yet effective, flow cytometry analysis to monitor the progress of the selection, avoiding the tedious, time consuming and radioactive EMSA process [39]\u2013[43]. After 14 rounds of selection, we have identified a group of DNA aptamers that specifically bound to AGR2 with high affinities. Structural studies on one of the aptamer sequences, C14B, revealed an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex, and its structure and binding affinity to AGR2 depend on K+ ion intensively. Furthermore, we designed an allosteric molecule beacon AGR2-aMB based on the identified aptamer, which enables simple, sensitive and selective detection AGR2. The aptamer sequences and AGR2-aMB reported in this study are potentially useful tools for early diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and for fundamental research to elucidate the biochemical functions of AGR2.",

The library was first allowed to interact with excess negative control beads, and only the DNA sequences that did not bound to the GST-beads were collected. The collected sequences were then incubated with AGR2-GST-beads. After rigorous washing, those sequences that either did not bind, or only weakly bound to the target were discarded. Only the sequences that bound strongly enough were retained on beads, and the bead-ssDNA complexes were collected and amplified by PCR for the next round of selection. After multiple rounds of selection, the subtraction process efficiently reduced the DNA sequences that bound to the GST beads, while those AGR2-specific aptamer candidates were gradually enriched. The progress of the selection process was monitored by flow cytometry. The stronger binding of DNA library to AGR2, the more FAM labeled sequences bound to the beads, thus the higher fluorescence intensity the beads would emit. With the increasing number of selection cycles, steady increases in fluorescence intensity on the target beads were observed (Figure 2a). The binding affinity of the enriched library after 14 rounds of selection was determined to be in the nanomolar range (Kd = 64.1\u00b15.4 nM), while there was no observable binding of the library to control beads (Figure 2b). These results suggested that the DNA aptamers specifically recognizing AGR2 were enriched during the selection process.",

The sequencing data for clones were analyzed by using sequencing analysis software Clustal W 6.0 [44].

Among the sequences from 62 clones, there were two subfamilies each containing multiple sequences with common features. One subfamily is guanosine-rich sequences (22 clones), and the other is thymine-rich sequences (40 clones) (Figure S1). Four sequences were chosen and synthesized for further characterization (Table S1): three sequences from G-rich subfamily, C14A (appeared 2 times), C14B (appeared 3 times) and C14C (appeared 5 times), and one sequence C14D (appeared 2 times) from T-rich subfamily. Only one T-rich sequence was chosen because of T-rich sequences tend to from non-rigid tertiary structures and the chance of being aptamer was thought to be very low. As shown in Figure 2c, C14B can bind AGR2 with the highest affinity (Kd = 13.1\u00b17.2 nM). Titration of C14B to GST-beads revealed no observable binding, establishing that the binding target of C14B was indeed AGR2.

To identify the binding region of the aptamer, the marginal sequences of C14Bwas gradually truncated. Two truncated sequencesC14B0 and C14B1 from C14B were shown in Table 1. Subsequent binding affinity experiments revealed that both C14B0 (8.5\u00b13.6 nM) and C14B1 (19.1\u00b15.1 nM) have similar Kd to AGR2 as that of original C14B (13.1\u00b17.2 nM). The majority of eliminated sequences were primer sequences, implying that the binding region of the aptamer was the middle of random sequences and the primer sequences do not or contribute little to the binding affinity of aptamer. C14B1 has five portions of poly-G and we designed five truncated sequences by removing one of poly-G portion each (Table S2). Removal of any poly-G portion would destroy its binding affinity to certain extend (Figure S3), suggesting the whole G-motif is required for aptamer binding. Taking together, these results indicate that C14B1, which was only 33 mer, was the essential binding region to AGR2. Thus, C14B1 was applied for further characterization and probe design.",

According to G-Quadruplex prediction formula d(G3+N1-7G3+N1-7G3+N1-7G3+) [45], C14B1 had great probability to form a G-Quadruplex structure. In the G-quadruplex, the planar square arrangement of four guanines (tetrad) is stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. Depending on the direction of the strands or parts of a strand that form the tetrads, structures may be described as parallel or antiparallel. Moreover, these quadruplexes can form through the intermolecular association of four or two DNA molecules, or by the intramolecular folding of a single strand containing four blocks of guanines [46] CD experiments were performed to investigate the secondary structure of aptamerC14B1. The CD spectrum of C14B1 showed a negative peak near 240 nm and a positive peak near 260 nm, a typical spectrum of a parallel G-quadruplex [47]. In order to investigate whether C14B1 forms an intermolecular 4 stranded or intramolecular single stranded G-quadruplex structure, the dependence of melting temperature on the concentration of C14B1 was studied [48]. The melting temperature of C14B1 was found to be 59\u00b0C, which was independent of oligonucleotide concentration (Figure S4), indicating that the aptamer forms an intramolecular G-quadruplex.",

The sensitive and selective detection of AGR2 is thus of great importance to early cancer diagnostics. Herein, by applying the selected and optimized aptamer C14B1, we designed and developed an allosteric molecular beacon against AGR2, named AGR2-aMB, which converts the molecule recognition property of aptamer to fluorescence flow cytometry signal for AGR2 sensing [55]. Figure 5 illustrates the working principle of AGR2-aMB. An AGR2-aMB is a ssDNA consisting of an streptavidin (SA) aptamer sequence [56], a C14B1 sequence, a short sequence complimentary to a small part of the SA aptamer sequence, and a fluorophore. A stable hairpin structure is formed by intramolecular hybridization between the SA aptamer sequence and the complementary sequence, temporarily disabling the probe's ability to bind with SA beads. Consequently, when incubated with SA beads, no probe can bind to SA beads, and the beads display very low fluorescence. In the presence of AGR2, however, the C14B1 sequence in the loop of aMB binds to the target sequence, which in turn disrupts the hairpin structure to free the SA binding sequence, thereby activating the probe's binding affinity to SA beads. Thus, the AGR2-bound probe will bind to SA beads, which will fluoresce strongly because the probe is FAM labeled. Target molecules can be detected and quantified by reading the fluorescence intensity of SA beads through flow cytometer.",

With the increase of AGR2 concentration, steady increases in fluorescence intensity on the target beads were observed. AGR2 at 100 nM concentration can be easily detected (Figure 6a). A series of proteins including BSA, trypsin, thrombin, and IgG were employed as controls (500 nM), and no distinct fluorescent signals were observed (Figure 6b), indicating an excellent specificity of the AGR2-aMB towards target molecule.

Beads-based SELEX allowed the use of simple, yet effective, flow cytometry analysis to monitor the progress of the selection, avoiding the tedious, time consuming and radioactive EMSA process. Through multiple rounds of selection with GST as a control, we have identified aptamers that selectively recognize AGR2 with nanomolar Kd values. CD measurements and melting-temperature assays demonstrated that the optimal aptamer C14B1 forms an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structure and its structure and binding affinity are strongly dependent on the nature of the monovalent ion.

To acquire aptamers with high affinity and specificity, the selection strength was enhanced gradually by increasing the number of washes (from three to ten times with 200 \u00b5L 1\u00d7PBS buffer each) and decreasing the amount of the ssDNA library per round (from 200 to 150 pmol).",
