            "text": "\nRespiratory viruses can cause mild to severe illnesses as well as frequent complications. They frequently cause pneumonia in children, especially those younger than 2 years (up to approximately 80%) [1, 2]. For adult patients in the ICU, these pathogens account for 28% of pneumonia cases, with mortality rates comparable to those of bacterial pneumonia [3]. The mean annual incidence of respiratory tract infections in the United States was reported to be 4.2 and 1.2 for the first and the second years of a child's life, respectively. Furthermore, 27% of respiratory tract infections resulted from coinfection with two or more viruses, including rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and adenovirus [4]. Since the year 2000, many new respiratory viruses have been identified including H5N1 avian influenza, SARS-coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63, human coronavirus HKU1, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human rhinovirus type C [5, 6]. Therefore, simultaneous identification of multiple viruses is needed for timely patient management.",

However, these automated nucleic acid extraction systems were evaluated using multiplex PCR or multiples real-time PCR assays which are capable of detecting only up to 5 viruses simultaneously in a single patient sample. Only recently, multiple real-time PCR assay which is capable detecting more than 14 viruses simultaneously was developed and widely used [19, 20]. But a comprehensive comparison of the automated extraction systems for these multiplex RT-PCR using nasopharyngeal aspirate samples has never been carried out. The EZ1 Advanced XL and the QIAcube systems have been popularly used in medical laboratories for DNA/RNA extraction, whereas the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system is newly introduced. Therefore, we evaluated the three different automated nucleic acid extraction systems for multiplex RT-PCR using clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens.",

The fluorescence was measured continuously during the temperature rise from 55\u00b0C. And, the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence over temperature versus temperature (\u2212dF/dT  versus  T) by Seegene software [19].

The nucleic acids extracted by EZ1 Advanced XL showed higher positive rates for virus detection than the others. Among the discrepant results, three positive nucleic acid extracts, which were obtained by only one of the three automated nucleic acid extraction systems, were confirmed by sequencing. Two positive nucleic acid extracts including RV (n = 1) and BoV (n = 1) were obtained by the QIAcube system, while one FluB positive nucleic acid extract was obtained with EZ1 Advanced XL (Table 2). On the basis of Section 2.5, sensitivity, specificity, concordance rate, and kappa coefficient for the 3 automated nucleic acid extraction systems are shown in Table 3. The percent sensitivity and specificity of the 3 systems ranged from 87.2% to 93.3% and from 82.9% to 94.6%, respectively. The concordance rates between the true results and the 3 systems ranged from 88.3% to 94.2%. The kappa coefficients ranged from 0.76 to 0.88 (P < 0.001 for all values). The QIAcube system yielded the best percent sensitivity and concordance rate, while the MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system demonstrated the lowest sensitivity and the highest specificity. Sensitivity and specificity of the 3 systems were also evaluated for the most commonly detected 5 viral pathogens. The QIAcube system showed the highest sensitivity for the RNA viruses (RV, MPV, PIV3, and RSV-A), while the EZ1 Advanced XL system demonstrated the best percent sensitivity for the ADV.",

The EZ1 Advanced XL system showed relatively high number of the discrepant results (n = 12) and false positives (n = 7), especially for ADV (3 false positives). However, it showed the best analytical sensitivity for ADV-3, FluA, and RSV-A (Table 4) and as well as the highest sensitivity for ADV in clinical specimens (Table 3). As the analytical sensitivity of the confirming test including the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene) and sequencing analysis could be lower than Anyplex II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene) [22], some of these false positive results could include true positive results. Therefore, we discerned that the EZ1 Advanced XL system is more suitable for ADV virus detection. The MICROLAB Nimbus IVD system showed the highest specificity (94.6%, only two false positives), but it demonstrated the lowest sensitivity (87.2%) with 6 false negatives (Table 3).",

In their study, these three different methods were evaluated with different sample volumes and elution volumes. The relative concentration ratios of the sample volume to elution volume were 4.5 for the NucliSens easyMAG, 2.5 for the BioRot 9604, and 1.0\u20132.3 for the manual QIAamp, respectively. However, the nucleic acids obtained by all three methods gave comparable sensitivities in PCR tests, and the three methods gave comparable viral loads [16] Therefore, we thought that the relative concentrative effect of the eluted nucleic acid may have little effect on the results of RT-PCR based methods. In a previous study, the MagNA Pure Compact machine with the MagNAPure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) demonstrated more than 4-fold higher DNA recovery from the S. pyogenes than the other automated extraction systems including KingFisher-ML (ThermoFisher Scientific Inc., Worcester, MA, USA), Biorobot EZ1 (Qiagen), easyMAG (bioMerieux), and Biorobot MDX (Qiagen); however, it was less efficient in RNA purification from RSV and influenza A virus viruses. This may be due to RNA degradation or inefficient RNA binding to the magnetic beads [17]. Actually, the MagNAPure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I was preferred for DNA extraction, although it did not include carried RNA. Inclusion of carried RNA could enhance the yield of a very few target molecules and reduce the chances of viral RNA degradation. In our study, all three extraction kits included carried RNA, and all three systems showed comparable efficiencies of RNA and DNA extraction (Table 4).",
