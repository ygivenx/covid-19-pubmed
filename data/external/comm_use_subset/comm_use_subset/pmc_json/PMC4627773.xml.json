Surface glycoproteins are particularly important for virulence determination in enveloped viruses as demonstrated with mammalian [11,17,18] and avian influenza viruses [19\u201325]. More specifically, the fusion activity of a virus can influence its uptake and also define its viral cell tropism through the availability of the appropriate activating protease in different tissues or cells [26\u201328]. A detailed investigation of how introduced mutations influence surface proteins function is essential to elucidate the mechanisms leading to the acquisition of a higher virulence. Such a level of understanding has been achieved using site directed mutation analysis for several viruses such as Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) [29], avian influenza viruses [30], and Measles viruses [31]. In contrast, the HE and F protein of ISAV have only been the subject of few such functional studies [9,10,32,33] and how mutations influence viral infectivity and virulence in general remains poorly understood.",

These HPR0 variants are characterised by a HE gene carrying a full length Highly Polymorphic Region (HPR), a 35 amino acid (aa) stretch located in the near membrane domain of the HE stalk [34,39\u201341]. These virus variants have not been associated with disease in Atlantic salmon, are primarily detected in gills by RT-qPCR and sequencing, and have so far not been propagated in tissue culture [6]. Moreover, all currently characterized pathogenic ISAV isolates have deletions in the HPR in relation to the HPR0 genotype [38,39,42]. This led to the classification of ISAV and their virulence based on HPR genotypes [39]. It also gave rise to the hypothesis that virulent ISAV strains may arise from a reservoir of full length non-pathogenic HPR0 through deletion events in the HE gene HPR [4,39,41,43] and potential sequence alterations in the F gene [44]. Recently, we demonstrated that deletions generated within a full length HPR significantly influenced the ability of the resulting mutant HEs to interact with the F protein and trigger fusion [10]. Our work also suggested that the aa composition of the associated F protein was a critical factor influencing the fusion process in conjunction with these deletions in the HE stalk.",

The F protein is generated as a 50 kDa inactive precursor molecule (F0), which once cleaved results in two disulphide linked subunits, F1 and F2 at 30 and 20 kDa respectively [9]. In other viruses, the newly formed amino F1 terminus is usually highly hydrophobic and functions as a fusion peptide which later leads to the merging of the virus and host cell membranes [46]. In ISAV, two potential cleavage sites, a lysine (K) in position 276 and arginine (R) in 267, have been proposed [9], but have yet to be functionally confirmed.",

Therefore, the precise location of mutations within surface glycoproteins tends to influence specific steps of the fusion process. In measles viruses, alteration of the attachment protein stalk affected how the H activated the F protein and subsequent fusion [31]. In ISAV, deletions within the HPR were suggested to influence the separation between HE and F proteins with a shorter stalk region resulting in higher fusion levels [10]. Since type I fusion proteins require activation by proteolytic cleavage, mutations in or near the cleavage site can define cleavage specificity and are known to impact cell tropism and the virulence status of influenza viruses [27,48\u201351] and NDV [46,52\u201355]. In ISAV, a glutamine (Q) to leucine (L) substitution in position 266 in the F protein was described as an important virulence determinant [44,56,57] and small sequence insertions near the putative cleavage sites have also been reported [36,56,58], which might influence enzymatic cleavage.",

The first objective was to functionally identify the actual cleavage site out of the two proposed previously. Secondly, we investigated separately whether single aa substitutions and insertions in the F protein influenced the proteolytic cleavage and fusion activity. Thirdly, a mutated HE with an HPR deletion was combined with these F protein mutants and the effect on F protein activation and proteolytic cleavage specificity assessed under normal culture conditions and following exposure to trypsin and low pH. Finally, fusion activity was also measured following the addition of calcium ionophore A23187, in an attempt to narrow down the potential type of cellular host proteases involved in ISAV fusion protein activation. The potential implications for the virulence of the different ISAV HPR genotypes are also discussed.",

Three photos of the transfected monolayers were taken for each group using an Axio Imager M2 microscope (Zeiss) at a 10x magnification and under green and red fluorescence conditions. The intensity mean values of green and red pixels were measured for each photo using ZEN 2012 image analysis software (Zeiss) and compared between different groups.

These mutations appeared to influence different steps of the fusion process and regulate fusion through various mechanisms. Certain substitutions and insertions upstream of the proteolytic cleavage site promoted cleavage activity, while others appear to influence post-cleavage steps. In comparison, HPR deletions influence the way the HE primes the F protein and facilitates either cleavage by an ubiquitous host cell protease and/ or post-cleavage refolding of the F protein. As in other orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, ISAV surface glycoprotein mutations shape the interaction between the attachment and F protein which ultimately influences viral fusion. This may in part contribute to the different degree of virulence and tissue/cell tropism reported for HPR0 and HPR deleted ISAV genotypes.",

            "text": "In this first set of experiments (Fig 2), fusion was triggered with exogenous trypsin. This pancreatic serine protease is highly specific and reactive to the positively charged side chains of Lysine (K) and Arginine (R) residues [63]. The active site of trypsin consists of a catalytic triad: H57, D102 and S195 which cleaves the peptide at the carboxyl side of the aa side chain using a hydrolytic reaction [64\u201366]. The R267A substitution in the F protein did not prevent proteolytic cleavage and fusion to occur therefore implying that the hydrolytic reaction carried out by the trypsin active site was still occurring elsewhere on the protein. In contrast, the K276A substitution completely prevented both the cleavage and fusion. An alanine is a neutral and particularly innocuous residue as it carries a non-polar side chain [67]. This non-reactive side chain prevented key steps of the hydrolytic reaction to occur and therefore stop proteolytic cleavage and subsequent fusion. This provided strong evidence that K276 is the true proteolytic cleavage site in the ISAV F protein. This is further supported by the fact that K276 is located immediately upstream of the N-terminus of the proposed fusion peptide region delimited by C277 and Y292, [9], a position similar to the proteolytic site of other orthomyxoviruses [68,69], coronaviruses [70] and paramyxoviruses [71,72].",

The F protein mutations located in close vicinity to the cleavage site were expected to impact the proteolytic cleavage and the conversion of the F protein into its F1-F2 biologically active conformation [73]. The G252S substitution was selected due to the high degree of variability at this particular position [58]. A serine was present at position 252 only in a few ISAV isolates [58]. The Q266L has been the subject of a more thorough study and has been reported as a potentially important virulence marker since the majority of HPR0 variants carry a Q at this position as opposed to a L for most virulent strains [56]. Only few strains of ISAV were reported with a P at position 266 [74]. All these 3 substitutions significantly increased viral fusion, but only Q266P enhanced the proteolytic cleavage. Although this study did not directly investigate the structural effect of these substitutions, it is possible that they may alter the shape and refolding of the F protein in such a way that the exogenous trypsin could more readily access the cleavage site. In avian influenza viruses, variations in the 3 aa immediately upstream of the cleavage site greatly influence the cleavage by trypsin in different HA subtypes [69], with certain substitutions making the cleavage loop more exposed and readily accessible to host proteases [30,69,75].",

In ISAV, insertion 2 (AY853944) occurred through recombination of the F gene with a partial sequence of segment 3 [58], and insertion 1 (EU449768) with a part of segment 2 [36]. These two insertions resulted in the addition of 1 and 2 extra K residues which could act as potential new productive cleavage sites. Addition of extra active trypsin cleavage sites has been reported for the highly pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza strain [79] and similar observations were made with the highly virulent Chilean isolate ISAV3-89 [80]. In the same study, modelling of the F protein from other ISAV isolates predicted that F protein insertions can also increase the number of recognition sites for other endopeptidases [80]. Another possibility is that like in human [81] and avian influenza [79], insertions in this region of the F protein may structurally extend the cleavage loop, making it more prone to enzymatic processing. Protein modelling of the ISAV F protein demonstrated that insertions, similar to those used in this study, are flexible regions which could promote access to the proteolytic processing site [80].",

Upon receptor binding, structural changes are propagated from the attachment protein globular head down to the stalk [83]. This reconfigures the stalk and transfers energy which alters the stability of the F protein thereby triggering structural rearrangements that expose the cleavage site [84\u201386]. Therefore, the mutant HPR0 HE with a deleted HPR provided information specifically on this early fusion triggering phase where the HE primes the F protein prior to cleavage. Fusion results under different culture conditions (Fig 4) suggest that the HPR length influences how the HE interacts and activates the F protein, consequently altering subsequent fusion. A possibility is that the HPR length may influence the structural rearrangement of the HE stalk following receptor binding. In paramyxoviruses, engineered disulphide bonds and mutations can disrupt the haemagglutinin stalk flexibility, which impede tetramer dissociation and inhibit the triggering of fusion [82,87].",

The length of the HE HPR may indirectly influence how the F protein is cleaved. A full length HPR0 HE could potentially have difficulties in priming and activating the F protein. Previously, full length HPR HEs were found to induce lower levels of HE and F protein separation following receptor binding and had a reduced fusion activity [10]. This could potentially prevent intracellular refolding of the F protein, making the cleavage site inaccessible to ubiquitous cellular endoproteases while in transit through the host Golgi apparatus and/or trans-Golgi network [89]. Results in Fig 4D confirmed that most of the glycoprotein groups with a full length HPR HE induced lower level of proteolytic cleavage than their deleted counterparts without any exogenous culture treatments. This suggested that ISAV F proteins may have reached the surface in an uncleaved, inactive form. A similar situation has been reported for NDV, although intracellular cleavage is limited by the presence of a single basic residue at the cleavage site [46,53]. This leads to the F protein being cleaved and fusion triggered only when trypsin and low pH are applied at the cell surface [53,90], as observed in this study (Fig 4A). This would explain why the same ISAV F proteins coupled with a full length HPR HE did not show any fusion activity when cell monolayers were left untreated (Fig 4C).",

Previous work supports this as HPR deleted HEs were shown to induce higher levels of HE and F protein separation post-receptor binding and were associated with a greater fusion activity [10]. Results in Fig 4D indicated that most of the glycoprotein groups with a deleted HPR HE led to higher level of proteolytic cleavage than their full length counterparts in the absence of exogenous culture treatments. This suggested that the majority of F proteins may have been cleaved intracellularly and reached the cell surface in a pre-activated state and already capable of moderate levels of fusion, even at neutral pH. Similarities can be drawn with NDVs possessing polybasic recognition sites which enable their F proteins to be cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi membrane, that then reach the cell surface cleaved and pre-activated [53,91,92]. However, furin is unlikely to be the host enzyme responsible for ISAV proteolytic cleavage, since the F protein does not harbour any typical furin recognition sites (data not shown). When administered to the calcium-free medium, calcium ionophore A23187 reduced fusion activity by inactivating the cleavage enzyme through depletion of intracellular calcium [89,93]. This indicated that the Atlantic salmon protease involved in the processing of ISAV F protein was calcium dependent and that it may belong to the proprotein convertase family [94\u201396] or equivalent in teleost fish.",

An alternative explanation could be that instead of influencing cleavage, HPR length affects subsequent refolding steps which lead to the F protein adopting its post-fusion conformation. Previous work has demonstrated that in certain SV5 F proteins, cleavage did not necessarily result in fusion activity and syncytia formation [97]. ISAV F protein refolding is triggered by low pH as demonstrated by fusion assays [9,10]. In other viruses, this stimulus induces major F protein structural rearrangements and the assembly of the head-domain heptad repeats into a central, trimeric \u03b1-helical coiled coil structure that propel the fusion peptide towards the target membrane [84,98]. Recent structural analysis confirmed that in ISAV F protein, residues E327 and E329 carboxyl-carbonate acts as a pH sensor that once activated at low pH binds and stabilises the extended central coiled-coil region via strong short hydrogen bonds [45]. In the present study, both the full length and deleted HPR HE could potentially allow the proteolytic cleavage to take place. However, when associated with a full length HPR0 HE, the poor activation of the F protein may imply that post-cleavage refolding could only be achieved with additional stimulus in the form of low pH treatment applied at the cell surface. In comparison, the high level of F protein activation induced by an HPR deleted HE may facilitate post-cleavage structural rearrangement that could be more easily achieved at neutral pH in the untreated cell monolayers.",

Therefore, like in influenza viruses and NDV, ISAV fusion is an important determinant of virulence and together with other factors, such as receptor availability on the cell surface [99], interferon antagonistic properties [100\u2013102] and certain polymerase features [103], partly contributes to the varying degree of virulence reported for different HPR genotypes. Variation in fusion ability linked to HE HPR deletions and F protein mutations may also explain the different tissue [4] and cell tropism reported in ISAV [15,99,104]. We propose that the fusion protein of viruses carrying full length HPR HE may be mainly activated by trypsin-like proteases, most likely at the cell surface. Some of these enzymes are principally found in the mucosal surfaces [105,106] and therefore would limit the replication of the HPR0 variant to these tissues, causing only mild and sub-clinical infection in gill as reported by field data [4]. In contrast, viruses carrying an HPR deleted HE may have their F protein activated by ubiquitous host cell proteases present in a wider array of tissues. This would allow viruses to fuse and replicate in a wider range of cells and tissues and cause a systemic infection that may lead to mortality, as corroborated by field data [107].",

Both substitutions and insertions close to and upstream of the cleavage site increased viral fusion. An HPR deletion influenced the ability of HE to prime the F protein and promote fusion activation by an ubiquitous host protease and/or subsequent post-cleavage refolding steps. Future work is still needed to fully characterise the fusion mechanisms affected by these mutations and to specifically identify the host protease involved in ISAV fusion. These findings emphasise that the variation in fusion ability between HPR0 and HPR deleted ISAV genotypes may be one of the factors contributing toward the difference in virulence and tissue/cell tropism.",
