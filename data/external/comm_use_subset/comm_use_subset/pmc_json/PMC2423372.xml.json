Once the outbreak reaches the UK, and a pandemic is confirmed, the NHS \"plans to care for large numbers of cases, and will only provide essential care\" p31 [2].

Quereshi et al [16] found that the most significant barrier to HCWs' willingness to work was fear for their own and their families' health. Based on a survey of mixed clinical and non-clinical workers in the USA, Balicer et al [17] anticipate up to 50% of HCWs being unwilling to work, with clinical staff more likely to attend than non-clinical ones.

For example, scarcity of resources and staff shortages may lead to the standards of care having to drop below what would be acceptable in 'normal' times. Staff may have to refuse care to people whom they could ordinarily easily help. Normal, but time consuming, consent procedures may have to be abandoned. All of these may well be ethically justified in an emergency situation, but nonetheless may be distressing for HCWs. Trust in government and management may affect HCWs' perceptions and reactions to a pandemic for two reasons. First, trust that the pandemic is being well-managed and that information they are provided with is reliable might reassure individuals that the work they are being asked to do is an effective way of dealing with the pandemic [18]. Second, people's attitudes towards taking additional risks might be affected by their perceptions of the extent to which these additional risks are attributable to action or inaction on the part of their managers/the government [19,20].",

Higher response rates are associated with short questionnaires and where the topic is of interest to the individual [29]. We anticipate that pandemic influenza will be a topic of considerable interest but, nevertheless, we have assumed a very conservative 25% response rate, an estimated 3,750 responses. This will be sufficient to determine the overall proportion with a positive attitude to continuing working with an overall precision of 2% (95% confidence), when a worst case assumption of 50% with a positive attitude to continuing working is used. Should this percentage be greater than (or less than) 50%, precision will be improved. Targeted approaches will be used to ensure that a minimum of 150 responses have been achieved from each of the 10 categories of HCWs, this will ensure that the percentage with a positive attitude to continuing working can be estimated with 95% confidence and 8% precision in each sub-group and to demonstrate differences of the order of 16% between sub-groups of HCWs with 80% power at the 5% significance level.",
