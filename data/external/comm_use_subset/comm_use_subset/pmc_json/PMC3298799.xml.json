In the US alone, PRRS is estimated to cause losses of $664 million every year [1]. As per the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service report of 2009, 49.8% of unvaccinated pigs in the US are seropositive to PRRS virus (PRRSV), suggesting PRRS an endemic disease in the US, and pig producers have to constantly battle against outbreaks. At present we lack a good understanding of early immunological mechanisms in PRRSV-infected pigs and elucidation of such information could guide us in the development of improved preventive or therapeutic measures.",

Adequate early activation of the innate immune system is critical to initiate generation of protective adaptive immunity to achieve complete viral clearance [2]. The quantities of important cytokines secreted in pigs infected by PRRSV appeared to be significantly lower than pigs infected with a swine influenza virus or porcine respiratory coronavirus [3-5]. Natural killer (NK) cell, a lymphocyte subpopulation, provides a first line of innate defense against virus infection [6]. In pigs, NK cells are small to medium sized lymphocytes and they lack adequate intracellular granules [7,8]. Therefore, although younger pigs possess a higher frequency of NK cells, they have reduced NK cytolytic activity [9]. Unfortunately, PRRSV further suppresses the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in infected pigs [10,11]. So far, studies addressing cytokine profiles and NK cell cytotoxic functions have been performed in pigs from 1 week post-PRRSV infection and under controlled experimental conditions.",

IFN-\u03b3 response in PRRSV-infected pigs appears to be dampened and delayed [13,15,16]. The Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles provide an elegant model of directed response to infectious pathogens and are indicative of immune regulation, protective immunity, and vaccine efficacy. The Th2 cytokine IL-4 is involved in suppression of pathogen-specific Th1 immune responses [17,18], but the role of IL-4 in the pig immune system appears to be different [19,20]. Lymphocytes expressing markers CD4 or CD8 alone and CD4 and CD8 together are important in viral clearance by secreting IFN-\u03b3 and mediating pathogen specific cytotoxicity [21-24]. Foxp3-expressing CD4+CD25+ cells with immunosuppressive properties, called \"T-regulatory cells (Tregs)\", have been identified in pigs [25]. PRRSV-mediated proliferation of Tregs in infected and vaccinated pigs suggests the involvement of Tregs in disease progression and immune modulation [11,26-30]. The mechanism of immune suppression in PRRSV-infected pigs appears to be governed by enhanced production of interleukin (IL)-10 [10,31,32], which drives the generation of IL-10-producing Tregs [33]. However, it has also been shown that IL-10 expression varies with infection using different strains of the PRRSV (Diaz et al., 2006); thus, it is unclear if Treg-mediated suppression of immune response occurs with all the strains of PRRSV.",

            "text": "Our rationale for conducting this study was to investigate how PRRSV rapidly modulates host innate immune mediators at an early time point post-infection, because the virus-induced adaptive immune response is always weak and delayed [34,35]. It is known that younger pigs suffer severely from PRRS than adult animals [32], likely resulting from poorly developed innate immune system or an efficient immune evasion strategy adapted by the virus. Innate NK cells are the lymphocyte subpopulation known for their ability to provide the first line of defense against viral infections [6]. Younger pigs have underdeveloped NK cell-mediated cytotoxic function [7,9], and in our study, approximately 50% of pigs at day 0 (preinfection) did not have detectable NK cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, in pigs with satisfactory NK cell cytotoxicity, PRRSV significantly suppresses the NK function by 50-80% from post-infection day 7-24 [10]. In the current study, as early as day 2 post-infection, a significant reduction in NK cell-cytolytic activity was observed. In addition, an increased frequency in NK cells rich fraction in virus-infected pigs did not result in rescued NK cytotoxicity, suggesting PRRSV-induced modulation in NK cell function. This could be one of the innate immune evasion mechanisms of PRRSV. All pigs with reduced NK cell cytotoxicity were viremic with titers greater than 2 logs, suggesting replicating PRRSV mediated suppression of NK cell function. In pigs, a precise selection marker for phenotypic analysis of NK cells is not available, however, CD56 is used in some studies [36,37]. Recently, we identified comparable frequency of CD56+ and CD3-CD4-CD8\u03b1+ cells in the pig PBMC (data not shown).",

In vitro stimulation of porcine monocytes and macrophages with low levels of IFN-\u03b1 (10 units/ml) stimulates increased expression of sialoadhesin, the receptor required for PRRSV internalization in macrophages. Interestingly, such a stimulation of macrophages for the initial 2-3 days is sufficient to enhance the efficiency of PRRSV infection by nearly 20-fold [40]. Consistent with that, our results identified a slight increase in IFN-\u03b1 production early post-infection in greater than 50% of PRRSV-infected pigs which maybe sufficient to augment the yield of replicating PRRSV.",

Impaired basal NK cell cytolytic activity, despite the presence of normal NK cell numbers, was observed due to impairment in the STAT1 pathway [46]. Recently, more than 1000-fold increase in IFN-\u03b1 production in mice by NK cells mediated through MIP-1\u03b2 and LFA was reported [47].

In both mice and humans, IL-4 is essential for antibody production and is a soluble diagnostic marker of Th2 immune response. In contrast, IL-4 is not a stimulatory factor for porcine B cells, and in fact in pigs, IL-4 blocks antibody and IL-6 secretion and also suppresses antigen-stimulated proliferation of B cells [19]. IL-4 suppresses the transcriptional activity of all the inflammatory cytokines and plays an important role in regulation of inflammatory activity of pig alveolar macrophages in respiratory disease conditions [20]. Therefore, the role of IL-4 in pigs is different compared to mice and humans. Overall, our study has demonstrated the correlative evidences on PRRSV-mediated suppression of NK cell function by coordinated modulation of multiple cytokines.",

            "text": "Studies have demonstrated the adjuvant role of IL-12 to live PRRSV vaccine in pigs by induction of IFN-\u03b3 production resulting in a protective immune response [49]. Although, increased secretion of IL-12 in PRRSV-infected pigs was detected early post-infection in our study, secretion of IFN-\u03b3 remained low. 2 days post-infection maybe too early to expect IFN-\u03b3 production, but PRRSV-induced upregulation of IL-12 did not increase the IFN-\u03b3 secretion even after 3 weeks post-infection [10]. Generally, IL-12 is a heterodimer consisting of p40 and p35 subunits [50,51], and it is a critical regulator of T and NK cell functions [52,53]. But IL-12 can also exist as a p40 homodimer which is a potent antagonist of immune responses [54]. The cytokine IL-12 mediates multiple roles in the immune system which include activation of macrophages during intracellular infection [55]. At present, reagents to differentiate homo- and heterodimers of porcine IL-12 are not available. Interestingly, our data further confirmed that PRRSV-induced enhanced IL-12 is not helping to elicit protective immunity against PRRSV infection. PRRSV has restricted cell tropism, with differentiated macrophages expressing various receptor molecules such as heparin sulphate, sialoadhesin, and CD163, which all aid in PRRSV invasion [56-58]. Therefore, PRRSV-induced upregulation of IL-12 might be involved in differentiation of macrophages which aids viral infection. However, targeted approach to investigate such a mechanism of action of IL-12 in PRRSV-infected pigs is important.",

Recently, a significant decrease in the frequency of Tregs in pigs vaccinated with a modified live PRRSV vaccine co-administered with a potent mucosal adjuvant and challenged with a virulent heterologous PRRSV MN184 has suggested the cross-protective immunity [11]. Increased frequency of Tregs in unvaccinated PRRSV challenged pigs was associated with an increased secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 [11]. Our study has demonstrated that the increased population of Tregs in PRRSV-infected pigs at day 2 post-infection is associated with an increased production of IL-10.

Briefly, PBMC were used as the source of NK cells (effectors) and K-562 human myeloblastoid leukemia cells were the targets. Effectors were incubated in RPMI supplemented with FBS with a fixed number of targets for 24 h at 37C in a CO2 incubator and the amount of released lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the supernatant was measured by a colorimetric assay. Released LDH is directly proportional to the NK-specific lysis of target cells. The percent of NK cell-specific killing was calculated after subtracting the spontaneously released LDH due to nonspecific cell lysis of targets.",
