Therefore, it is important to develop antiviral strategies to efficiently combat viral infections. One intriguing approach is the use of small molecule inhibitors of viral infections as demonstrated by the use of ribavirin against hepatitis C virus (HCV), respiratory syncytial virus and treatment of Lassa fever as well as amantadine and rimantadine M2 channel inhibitors and zanamivir and oseltamivir neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza virus [1], [2], [3]. Additional 40 antiviral drugs have been approved for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and herpesviruses [2]. To find additional inhibitors of viral infections, researchers screened small molecule libraries that identified a few more potent antiviral chemicals [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",

            "text": "In spite of the above progress with small molecule inhibitors of human and animal viruses, identification of small molecule inhibitors to combat plant virus infections is much less advanced. Therefore, we have chosen a simple model virus, Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV), to test small molecule inhibitors. TBSV, a small (+)RNA virus of plants, has emerged as a highly suitable model virus for studying viral RNA replication and recombination [10]. The genomic (+)RNA of TBSV codes for p33 and p92pol replication proteins [10]. p33 is an essential replication co-factor performing recruitment of the viral RNA template into replication [11], [12], [13], and in the assembly of the viral replicase [14]. The p92pol is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [15], [16], [17]. Both replication proteins are integral part of the tombusvirus replicase complex, which also contains host proteins [18], [19]. Several of these host factors have been identified via proteomics approaches [19], [20], [21]. The list includes the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Ssa1/2p in yeast), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by TDH2 and TDH3 in yeast), pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p), Cdc34p ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) [19], [20], [21]. These host factors provide various functions, such as facilitating the assembly of the viral replicase complex and promoting asymmetrical viral RNA synthesis [22], [23], [24], [25].",

Besides their anti-prion effect, QC and CPZ have been used in humans for many years, respectively, as antimalarial and antipsychotic drugs [29], [30], [31]. Detailed studies on the mechanism of inhibition revealed that inhibition by CPZ and QC was due to effects of these compounds on the following steps: (i) inhibition of the assembly of the viral replicase complex (for CPZ), suppression of production of viral replication proteins during translation (for QC); (ii) inhibition of RNA\u2013viral protein interaction during RNA recruitment for replication (for QC); and reducing minus-strand synthesis (for QC). Altogether, these acridine derivatives could be useful antiviral compounds against selected plant viruses.",

            "text": "To define the mode of action for these acridine derivatives leading to inhibition of TBSV RNA accumulation, we took advantage of efficient in vitro replication assays developed for tombusviruses. First, we used an in vitro replicase assembly assay that includes purified recombinant TBSV p33 and p92pol replication proteins and a yeast cell-free extract [23]. This cell-free system can be programmed with plus-stranded (+)TBSV replicon (rep)RNA, which leads to the assembly of the TBSV replicase on the membranes. The in vitro assembled replicase is capable of supporting complete cycle of TBSV replication leading to the production of (+)repRNA progeny [23], [32]. Testing the effect of CPZ and QC revealed 90\u201395% inhibition of TBSV replication when the chemicals were applied at an early time point of the assay (Fig. 2A, lanes 2\u20134 and 10\u201312). In the in vitro replicase assembly assay, the first 40 min consist of recruitment of the repRNA, the viral replication proteins and host proteins, such as Hsp70 to the membrane [23], [32], followed by the assembly of the membrane-bound replicase complex, whereas viral RNA synthesis occurs after \u223c20\u201340 min of incubation until \u223c3 hours. These experiments revealed that both CPZ and QC inhibited TBSV repRNA replication when added at the beginning of incubation (0 time point) (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 12), while they were not as effective at the 60-min time point (lanes 1 and 9). This suggests that CPZ and QC likely inhibit the early steps in virus replication, possibly including the recruitment of the viral RNA or the assembly of the functional replicase complex in the membrane, while they could only partially inhibit viral RNA synthesis in vitro.",

CPZ is known to bind to phospholipids and modify the features of membranes [33]. Therefore, we have tested if treatment of the membranes by CPZ could affect the subsequent assembly of the TBSV replicase. First, we pretreated the membrane fraction of the yeast cell extract for 15 min with either CPZ, QC or DMSO as a control, and then we washed the membrane fraction with buffer A to remove the chemicals not bound to membrane lipids. Second, to the pre-treated membrane fraction, we added the TBSV (+)repRNA and the purified recombinant p33 and p92pol proteins in combination with the soluble fraction of the yeast extract. Under these conditions, the TBSV replicase can be successfully assembled in vitro and accordingly, replication of TBSV (+)repRNA was detected in the in vitro replication assay in the presence of the control DMSO (Fig. 2B, lanes 3\u20134 and 7\u20138). Interestingly, pre-treatment of the membrane fraction with CPZ led to 3-fold decrease in the TBSV replicase activity in vitro (Fig. 2B, lanes 1\u20132 and 9\u201310), whereas pre-treatment with QC had less than 20% inhibitory effect (lanes 5\u20136 and 11\u201312). These results demonstrated that pre-treatment of the membrane with CPZ inhibits the subsequent assembly of the TBSV replicase complex.",

The binding of p33 to RII(+)-SL is required for template selection, the recruitment of the viral RNA for replication and for assembly of the active replicase complex. To test if binding of p33 to RII(+)-SL is affected by CPZ and QC, we performed in vitro gel-shift experiments with purified components. This assay is suitable to obtain information on binding of p33 to the viral RNA, which is relevant for in vivo TBSV RNA recruitment activity of p33 [13]. We found that QC strongly inhibited p33-RII(+)-SL interaction in vitro (Fig. 3B, lanes 1\u20134 versus 5\u20138), whereas the effect of CPZ was less pronounced at high p33 concentrations (Fig. 3A, lanes 3\u20134). Altogether, these in vitro binding experiments suggest that QC can strongly interfere with binding of p33 to the TBSV (+)RNA, thus inhibiting the recruitment of (+)repRNA into replication, whereas the effect of CPZ on the interaction might only be effective at lower p33 concentrations (e.g., in the beginning of infection).",

To test this possibility, we used the in vitro wheat germ translation assay that can be programmed with added RNA templates. When capped and polyadenylated mRNA for p33 (similar to that expressed in yeast from plasmid to support TBSV replication) [16] was used, then we did not observe any major inhibitory effect by CPZ and QC (Fig. 4A, lanes 3\u20136). In contrast, in vitro translation of uncapped and nonpolyadenylated TBSV RNA, which is the common form of TBSV RNA replicating in N. benthamiana protoplasts (Fig. 1A), was inhibited by QC at 20 \u00b5M concentration resulting in \u223c15% p33 when compared with the DMSO-treated control (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 versus 1), whereas CPZ did not have significant inhibitory effect (lanes 2\u20133). Thus, QC seems to selectively inhibit the translation of uncapped and nonpolyadenylated TBSV gRNA.",

The reduced level of viral RNA recruitment by p33 caused by QC is expected to lead to low level of replicase assembly, which requires the viral RNA component [14], [32], [53]. QC also inhibited minus-strand synthesis, but not (+)-strand synthesis, suggesting that QC selectively interacts with the viral (+)RNA template. Indeed, the RNA binding feature of QC has been demonstrated before including GAAA tetraloop [54], various base-paired RNAs [55], A-form and H(L)-form of poly(rC)-poly(rG) [56], and single-stranded poly(A) [57]. In addition to the above steps, QC also inhibited the translation of TBSV genomic RNA, which is uncapped and nonpolyadenylated. This inhibition was specific, since QC did not inhibit the translation of the capped/polyadenylated p33 mRNA in the wheat germ assay (Fig. 4). Altogether, although QC can inhibit various steps during the infectious cycle of TBSV (Fig. 8), it is possible that most or all of these inhibitory effects are due to the likely ability of QC to bind to viral RNA and inhibit protein - RNA interactions essential for TBSV replication.",

            "text": "The in vitro experiments have revealed that CPZ inhibits TBSV replication using a different mechanism from that of QC. We found that CPZ reduced drastically the in vitro activity of the TBSV replicase at the early time points, but CPZ had only weak inhibitory effect on binding of p33 to (+)RNA. In addition, CPZ did not inhibit the translation of TBSV gRNA. Also, CPZ did not inhibit (\u2212) or (+)strand synthesis in an assay with the solubilized/purified tombusvirus replicase (Fig. 2C\u2013D). In vitro replication of the TBSV repRNA was reduced only moderately by CPZ when used at a late (60 min) time point (Fig. 2A), arguing that once most of the replicase complexes have been assembled (between 0\u201360 min), then it becomes less sensitive to the presence of CPZ. Based on these data, it is likely that CPZ inhibits the assembly of the TBSV replicase, which occurs after translation and template selection/recruitment of the viral (+)RNA (Fig. 8). Albeit the assembly process is not yet completely understood for tombusviruses or other (+)-strand RNA viruses, it is likely that multiple viral protein - host protein and viral RNA - protein interactions as well as protein - subcellular membrane interactions have to take place for successful replicase assembly [24], [58]. Although CPZ could affect many of the above interactions, we obtained some evidence that interactions of the above factors with the subcellular membranes might be affected by the CPZ treatment (Fig. 2B). This is based on pre-treatment of the membrane fraction of the yeast cell-free extract with CPZ, followed by thorough washing of the membrane to remove unbound chemicals prior to the addition of the viral RNA template, the viral replication proteins, and the cytosolic (soluble) fraction of the cell-free extract. The pre-treatment of the membrane fraction with CPZ has led to reduced level of TBSV replication in vitro (Fig. 2B). Since CPZ binds rapidly to phospholipid bilayers and disturbs the molecular ordering of phospholipids [33] and CPZ is also known to affect the bending of the membrane lipids by favoring outward bending of membranes, we propose that CPZ could inhibit the assembly of the replicase complex and thus, TBSV replication via altering the features of intracellular membranes. Indeed, CPZ, when inserted into lipid bilayers, has been shown to induce spontaneously positive curvatures, and inhibit the formation of surfaces with negative curvature [59]. However, replication and the assembly of the replicase of some RNA viruses needs bending of the membranes in inward direction to assemble viral-induced spherules, where replication takes place [60], [61]. So, the opposing bending effect of CPZ and viral replication proteins during the replicase assembly might lead to reduced efficiency of viral replicase assembly. However, we cannot rule out that CPZ could bind to some membrane proteins present in the membrane fraction of the cell extract, which could also lead to a decrease in viral replicase assembly.",

Indeed, antiprion activity of both QC and CPZ may be related to their ability to down regulate the protein folding activity of the ribosome (Ribosome-borne Protein Folding Activity or RPFA) [62], [63]. Interestingly, QC is able to directly interact with Domain V of the large rRNA (which bears the RPFA that may be involved in prion propagation) whereas the effect of CPZ would be more indirect and involves its ability to interact with and disturb cell membranes thus activating a transduction pathway ultimately leading to down regulation of the synthesis of rRNA and also of other ribosome constituents (MB, unpublished). The parallelism with the situation observed here (QC having a role through a direct interaction with RNA, CPZ having a more indirect role involving its capacity to interfere with cell membrane) is particularly noticeable. The analysis of the effect on plant viruses of other antiprion compounds also able to interfere with RPFA and RNA is therefore of interest and will be the subject of future studies.",

After preparing the membrane fraction containing the active CNV replicase, we solubilized the replicase and partially purified it as described [34]. The obtained tombusvirus replicase is template dependent and it can use added TBSV-derived RNA templates for complementary RNA synthesis, including (+) or (\u2212)RNA synthesis depending on the polarity of the added RNA template [34], [35], [67]. We performed the replicase assay for 3 hours at 25\u00b0C using (+) or (\u2212)DI-72 RNA in the presence of 50 \u00b5M CPZ, 20 \u00b5M QC or DMSO (0.01% and 0.004%, respectively) as a control.
