            "text": "Understanding infectious disease patterns (i.e. space-time variations and/or changes) has always been a challenging affair. Disease diffusion can vary significantly from place to place and from time to time for a number of reasons, including heterogeneity of the hosts and pathogens, physical and social environments, and interactions across space and time. Moreover, uncertainties linked to population movement and records of infected individuals can increase the difficulty of understanding the spatiotemporal spread of an infectious disease. A number of key studies have shown that infectious disease spread depends significantly upon the spatial features of a population [1]\u2013[5] whereas major benefits of spatial disease modeling include the assessment of disease intervention and control strategies (e.g., border control and quarantine). Accordingly, several models have been proposed to quantify the spatial disease features at both population and individual scales [1], [6]\u2013[8]. Among the best-known models are the gravity, the spatial micro-simulation, and the network models [1], [6], [9]. Most of these models focus primarily on interactions between the susceptible and infected populations across geographical locations, without considering the continuous local population dynamics of disease evolution. This is especially the case for the gravity model, where the geographical distribution and interaction patterns of populations are discretized into separated locations. Stochastic \u201cSusceptible-Infected-Recovered\u201d models (SIR, [10]\u2013[13]) have been widely implemented to represent disease evolution of populations over time. Spatial metapopulation approaches extend SIR models to explicitly account for the local or global population movements between different geographical locations, in terms of patches or networks with deterministic or stochastic characteristics [14]\u2013[16].",

The latter are empirical estimates of the normalized to max-1 covariance function at different times t, obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. For small times t<10, one observes a very good fit between the empirical and theoretical covariances across space. However, as t increases and for large distances  the deviations between simulated and theoretical covariances become larger.

SIR models have for a long time been applied to study population-based disease diffusion at a specific site over time. To account for spatial diffusion, studies have been focusing on integrating detailed geographical information into SIR models by using multiple patches or networks to characterize the population movements and interactions. The detailed geographical topology can possibly consider the spatial heterogeneity of disease transmission. Under the framework of SIR-extended models, space-time disease diffusion can be studied based on the knowledge of the parameters of disease dynamics inferred from data; e.g. transmission rate. However, in most cases, detailed and accurate information on population interactions is partially available. In addition, infectious disease data can be sparse and highly noisy and, therefore, the characteristics of disease dynamics are highly uncertain, especially at the initial stage of the disease outbreak. In this study, we account for uncertainties in the available data, as well as the unknown characteristics of disease dynamics, by proposing a spatiotemporal BME-SIR method of infectious disease spread. Based upon the SIR concept, the BME framework allows space-time disease modeling to account for patch-based population movements and multiple-sourced uncertainties, including: 1) unknown prior knowledge of disease dynamics, i.e. transmission and recovery rates, and 2) uncertainties in disease data from direct or indirect observations.",

Overall, the linearized SIR model showed good performance in reproducing the infected, susceptible and recovered population fractions, their empirical correlations (Fig. 4), and in inferring the transmission and recovery rates from data with low estimation error (see Fig. 13 and the error bars in Figures 14\u201315) and minimal computational effort. This makes the developed BME-SIR model an ideal framework for real-world application studies, where one needs to model the spread of infectious diseases in space-time, for different initial conditions, using a minimum number of parameters. The latter should suffice to reproduce the covariance structure of the susceptible, infected and recovered population fractions at different times over the whole simulation grid. The BME-SIR model effectively achieves this goal using only two model parameters (transmission and recovery rates), which can be easily inferred from data and, in more demanding studies, can vary systematically in both space and time.",

For the cases of emerging infectious diseases, real-time prediction is essential due to higher risks and increased uncertainties in the infected cases and disease parameters, e.g. reproduction number. Modeling of the spatiotemporal patterns of emerging disease spread involves uncertainties from various sources, e.g. model uncertainty, parameter and data uncertainties. Data assimilation approaches can continuously incorporate new observations into the physical process, and has been widely used in a variety of applications, e.g. geosciences [25], [26]; however, relatively few studies investigated the application of data assimilation approaches to infectious disease predictions [27]. Kalman filter is one of the most widely used data assimilation approaches for real-time prediction. It is based upon the state-space model and assumes the model and observation uncertainties are Gaussian-distributed. The BME-SIR method combines the linearized state-space model (i.e. general knowledge), with disease data with various levels of uncertainty (i.e. site-specific knowledge), to produce real-time disease estimates. Similar to the other data assimilation methods (e.g. Kalman filter), BME-SIR can update the model predictions, whenever new observations become available. The proposed spatiotemporal BME-SIR filtering framework can incorporate multi-sourced uncertainties (like exKF), and produce real-time disease estimates in a space-time domain. The distinction between exKF and BME-SIR methods is that BME-SIR can account for data uncertainties without any underlying distributional assumptions. Real-time estimates of infected population fractions as well as the transmission and recovery rates are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. Note that the estimates obtained by BME-SIR and exKF are consistently updated as new observations become available. The parameter values predicted by BME-SIR and exKF reach an equilibrium after about 10 weeks (see Fig. 10). Spatial maps of the predicted mean of the infected population fraction, , were produced on a spatial grid of 30\u00d725 = 750 nodes for each of the 20 weeks of the study; see Fig. 11.",

BME disease modeling can rigorously integrate different disease knowledge bases, e.g. laws of disease evolution dynamics with available space-time disease datasets to provide informative and accurate predictions of disease spread. BME distinguishes between two major disease knowledge bases (KBs): (a) the core or general KB, G-KB, which includes physical and biological laws (e.g., the SIR model); and (b) the site-specific KB, S-KB, which includes hard or exact data and soft or uncertain data (e.g., observations of disease counts across space-time as exact numerical values or as interval and probability distributions of possible values). The BME method integrates both knowledge bases (i.e. ) in terms of the following fundamental BME equations [17], [18]\n(3)where the vector  denotes realizations of the distribution of  in space-time (clearly, the equation could be written in terms of  and  realizations, as well),  is a vector of functions that represent stochastically the G-KB under consideration (the bar denotes statistical expectation), and  is a vector of coefficients that depend on the space-time coordinates ( is linked to ).

The estimation of  at different spatial locations and temporal instances (i.e. space-time points) is based on operational Bayesian theory which does not require any distributional assumptions [35].",

One sees that both methods provide effective estimates of the SIR recovery rates at all times, but the corresponding estimates of the transmission rates for large times t (i.e., t>50) are poor. The changes in the recovery and transmission rates show some interesting temporal patterns. When t is small (e.g., t<10), the estimated rates are closely associated with their initial guess and therefore the deviations of both the BME-SIR and exKF rate estimates are large. The improvement of rate estimation is shown over time. The transmission rate estimation accuracy obtained by both methods is low when t>40. This is due to the low portion of susceptibles after time t = 40 (i.e., the percentage of susceptible population after t>40 is less than 3%), which yields transmission rate estimates insensitive to observations. However, even in the case of low infected population fractions, both the BME-SIR and exKF methods produce accurate recovery rate estimates. Clearly, the SIR model is more sensitive to changes in the recovery rate rather than the transmission rate (Figs. 15\u201316). As a result, real-time data assimilation should lead to better estimates of real-time transmission rates.",
