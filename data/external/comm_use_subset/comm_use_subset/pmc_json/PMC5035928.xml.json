Illumina sequencing yielded between 1.1 and 7.8 million reads per pool, and DIAMOND classification20 of the obtained contigs indicated that five pools contained a significant amount of RVA sequence reads. The percentage reads mapping to RVA in each pool ranged from 0.1\u20132.4% (Table 1). Partial segments were completed by regular PCR and Sanger sequencing, to obtain at least the entire ORF for each of the obtained variants. Obtained sequences were used for phylogenetic comparison with a selection of representative members of each genotype. The RVA strains discovered in this study were named RVA/Bat-wt/CMR/BatLi08/2014/G31P[42], RVA/Bat-wt/CMR/BatLi09/2014/G30P[42], RVA/Bat-wt/CMR/BatLi10/2014/G30P[42], RVA/bat-wt/CMR/BatLy03/2014/G25P[43] and RVA/Bat-wt/CMR/BatLy17/2014/G30P[47] hereafter referred to as BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10, BatLy03 and BatLy17, respectively. All the obtained sequences were highly divergent from established genotypes and were therefore submitted to the Rotavirus Classification Working group (RCWG) for novel genotype assignments (see below) and to GenBank (accession numbers: KX268743\u2013KX268797).",

            "text": "The VP7 gene of BatLy03 was 96% identical (on the nucleotide (nt) level, supplementary data S1) to the Kenyan bat RVA strain KE4852 counterpart, which had been previously classified as a G25 genotype (Fig. 2). BatLi10 and BatLi09 were 100% identical and also clustered closely with strain BatLy17 (92% similar). This cluster was only distantly related to all other known VP7 RVA sequences as well as to strain BatLi08, which also formed a unique long branch in the phylogenetic tree. Both clusters only show similarities below 74% with established genotypes (Fig. 2). The VP7 of these 4 strains (BatLi10, BatLi09, BatLy17 and BatLi08) did not belong to any of the established RVA G-genotypes, according to the established criteria6, and were assigned genotypes G30 (BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17) and G31 (BatLi08) by the RCWG. For VP4, VP1 and VP3, all five Cameroonian bat RVAs strains were distantly related to other known RVA strains, including the Kenyan and Chinese RVA strains and were therefore assigned to novel genotypes according to the RCWG classification criteria (Fig. 3). The VP4 gene of strains BatLi08, BatLi09 and BatLi10 (representatives of the novel genotype P[42]) were almost 99\u2013100% identical to each other and only 56\u201375% identical to any other P-genotype. That of strains BatLy03 and BatLy17 had 29% nt dissimilarity to each other and their nt identity ranged from 60\u201376% with other P-genotypes and therefore were assigned the genotypes P[43] and P[47], respectively. The VP1 and VP3 genes of BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17 were nearly identical (nt identity range 99\u2013100%) and clustered together but distinct from other established R and M-genotypes, thereby representing the new genotypes R15 and M14, respectively (Fig. 3). The VP1 and VP3 genes of BatLy03 were only distantly related to the other four Cameroonian bat RVAs (68\u201377% nt identity) and are the sole member of the newly assigned genotypes R16 and M15, respectively (Fig. 3). The VP6, VP2, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 gene segments of 4 of our strains (BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17) were distantly related to their counterparts of other mammalian and avian RVAs (Fig. 4). For all the 4 strains, these gene segments clustered together and were 99\u2013100% identical to each other and consequently they constitute new genotypes for the different gene segments (I22, C15 N15, T17 and H17, respectively). The VP6, VP2, NSP2, NSP3 and NSP5 gene segments of BatLy03 phylogenetically clustered together with the Kenyan bat RVA strain KE4852 in the previously established I15, C8, N8, T11 and H10 genotypes, respectively (Fig. 4). For NSP1, the Cameroonian bat strains BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy17 clustered closely together (98\u2013100% nucleotide sequence identity) in the novel genotype A25, and showed only 67% nucleotide similarity to strain BatLy03 (A26). These 5 new NSP1 gene segments were only 42\u201345% identical to that of the most closely related established NSP1 genotype A13 and A14 (from cow) (Fig. 5). The NSP4 gene segments of all the 5 RVAs discovered in this study were quite divergent to those of other known bat rotaviruses (at most 69% nucleotide sequence identity) and other RVAs (approximately 45\u201368% nucleotide similarity) forming two distinct clusters. The NSP4 gene segments of strains BatLi08, BatLi09, BatLi10 and BatLy03 (genotype E22) were 100% identical but all were 37\u201338% divergent from that of BatLy03 (E23, Fig. 5).",

In order to find out if the currently used human RVA screening primers would detect the bat RVA strain from this study in case of zoonosis, we compared these primers with their corresponding sequences in the respective gene segments (Table 2 and Supplementary data S2). Overall, the similarity percentages for the VP7 forward and reverse primer between the bat RVA sequences and the human primers were 57.1\u2013100% and 63.2\u201395%, respectively. For VP4, the percentage similarity ranged from 63.6\u201394.4% and 76.2\u201385.7% for the forward and reverse primers, respectively. VP7 forward primers Beg9, sBeg9 and 9Con1-L showed a (near) perfect match with BatLy03-G25, whereas strain BatLi08-G31 and BatLy17-G30 (first 6 nt are missing for this strain), showed up to 10 and 4 nucleotide mismatches at the 3\u2032end of the primers, respectively. VP7 forward primer 9con1-L showed a perfect match with all the genotypes (G25, G30 and G31). Considering the VP7 reverse primers EndA, VP7-Rdeg, End9 and RVG9, BatLy03-G25 did not show a perfect match as there were 4, 1, 4 and 2 mutations, respectively. The mismatches with EndA, VP7-Rdeg and RVG9 were near the middle or at the 5\u2032end of the primer, whereas 2 of those of End9 were close to the 3\u2032end. Comparing the same VP7 reverse primers with strain BatLi08-G31 and BatLi09-G30 also showed mismatches. For EndA and VP7-Rdeg maximum 2 mismatches are located in the middle or near the 5\u2032-end, whereas for End9 and RVG, there were multiple mismatches of which 2 and 7 mismatches, respectively were right at the 3\u2032-end. For VP4 forward primer VP4-1-17F, BatLy03-P[43], BatLi08-P[42], BatLy17-P[47] and BatLi09-P[42] showed 2, 2, 1 and 2, mismatches, respectively, with at least a mutation at the first position from the 3\u2032end for all of them. For con3, there were 6, 7, 6 and 8 mismatches with BatLy03-P[43], BatLi08-P[42), BatLi09-P[42] and BatLy17-P[47], respectively. Considering the VP4 reverse primer con2, strains BatLy03-P[43], BatLi08-P[42], BatLi09-P[42], BatLy17-P[47] and BatLi10-P[42] showed 3\u20135 mismatches including one at the second position from the 3\u2032-end.",

Using an unbiased viral metagenomics approach, we identified 5 divergent novel bat RVA strains, 4 of which were genetically similar to each other. The fifth strain was related to the Kenyan bat strain. Interestingly, all these RVAs were identified in adult (both female and male) straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) which is in contrast to human and other animals whereby RVA (symptomatic) infections occur mostly in juveniles1. Also, diarrhea or other obvious signs of sickness were not noticed in these bats. This may suggest that bats may undergo active virus replication and shedding without obvious clinical signs25, which potentially could increase human exposure.",

The two Chinese RVA strains are genetically quite conserved (all segments of both strains have the same genotype except for their VP4 gene). Based on genome comparisons of Chinese bat and partial human RVA strains from Thailand (CMH079 and CMH222) and India (69 M, 57 M and mcs60), Xia and colleagues speculated that Asian bat RVAs may have crossed the host species barrier to humans on a number of occasions19. In addition, the unusual equine strain E319826 shares the same genotype constellation with either MYAS33 and/or MSLH14 in all segments except VP6. This data therefore suggests that this equine RVA strain most likely share a common ancestor with Asian bat RVAs. Furthermore, the genotype constellations of these Asian bat RVA (Table 3) are reminiscent to the Au-1-like genotype backbone of feline/canine-like RVA strains, as well as to the genotype constellation of two unusual simian RVAs (RRV and TUCH)27, suggesting that interspecies transmissions might have also occurred in the distant past. Moreover, an unusual Ecuadorean human RVA, Ecu53428 is closely related to bat sequences from Brazil recently submitted to GenBank. Similarly, possible interspecies transmission trends were also suggested by He and colleagues18 between bovine strain RVA/Cow-wt/IND/RUBV3/2005/G3P[3] and the bat strain MSLH14.",

Comparisons (Table 2 and Supplementary data S2) of these primers with the corresponding sequences showed that the primer combination 9Con1-L and VP7-Rdeg2122, would most likely detect both G25 and G31 RVA strains. Also, the combination of either Beg9 or sBeg9 with End9 or RVG924 might be successful in amplifying G25, but the same combinations might not be able to pick up the novel G31 and G30 genotypes in PCR screening assays. Furthermore, the primer combination Beg9/sBeg9 and EndA29 are likely to detect G25, but will be unsuccessful in case of G30 and G31 especially if the forward primer Beg9 is used. Considering VP4, both forward primers, VP4-1-17F30 and Con323 in combination with the reverse primer Con2 will be sub-optimal in detecting any of the P genotypes. Generally, with the exception of strain G25, detection of most of the bat strains will be sub-optimal or not successful at all for the different available primer combinations. Therefore, zoonotic events of bat RVA strains could easily be missed with the current screening primers depending on the primer combinations, PCR conditions and/or circulating zoonotic strains.",

For gene segments lacking the 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 ends of the ORF the single primer amplification method (Primers in Supplementary S4) was used as described previously34. Sanger sequencing was done on an ABI Prism 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts, USA).",
