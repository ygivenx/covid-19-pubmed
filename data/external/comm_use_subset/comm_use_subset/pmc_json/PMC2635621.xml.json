            "text": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a nephrotoxic mycotoxin produced by several species in the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. These species occur worldwide, as a contaminant of agricultural commodities, especially cereals [1], but also in a variety of other food commodities [2, 3] as a result of poor storage of said commodities or poor agricultural practice during drying procedures [4]. OTA is nephrotoxic to all animal species and causes mycotoxicosis in animals, particularly in swine [5, 6] and this mycotoxin plays a special role in the genesis of mycotoxic porcine nephropathy (MPN), a common disease in Scandinavia [5]. OTA has been considered as possible cause of the human disease known as Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) [7]. The toxicological profile of OTA includes teratogenesis, nephrotoxicity and immunotoxicity [8]. Moreover, OTA was classified as being carcinogenic in animals [9\u201311]. Special attention has been paid to OTA since 1993, when the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified this toxin as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B) [12\u201314]. Under certain circumstances the levels of OTA in pig blood are of great concern. Hult et al. (1980) demonstrated that the level of OTA in blood is very expressive of the general exposure of the individuals to this mycotoxin and would be a useful tool in diagnosing ochratoxicosis. The high affinity of OTA to proteins, particularly to serum albumin, allows its accumulation in the organs of animals [16]. In fact, animal-derived products and tissues for human consumption may well present OTA residues even if the animal has been nourished with feeds contaminated with low levels of OTA. In many studies, OTA has been detected in pig\u2019s blood, kidney, liver muscle and adipose tissue with rather high levels found in animals suffering from porcine nephropathy [6, 17\u201322], especially in countries of Balkan Peninsula [23\u201327]. A nephropathy in pigs with characteristic macroscopic changes of the type \u201cmottled or pale enlarged kidneys\u201d has been frequently identified at meat inspection in Serbia, corresponding well with the data found in other countries of the Balkan Peninsula [24].",

The regional differences and seasonal variations might thus partially explain the concentration differences in the corresponding formulas, as could differences in the storage condition of feedstuffs.

            "text": "With regards to a consumer safety point of view, the literature contains several studies investigating the ration between the levels of OTA in pig kidneys and pig meat [20, 25, 35, 36, 39]. A contamination level for the entire carcass at 25 ng/g pig kidney should secure that the level in meat do not exceed 10 ng/g, based on the estimation that the OTA level in pig meat is approximately 40% of the level in pig kidney. The ration \u201ccontent in meat/content in kidney\u201d varied between 10 and 90%, and can depend on many factors, e.g. the content of OTA in feed, feeding period, feeding in relation to time of slaughtering. The results from these survey indicated that there was a low correlation between the OTA level in serum and liver as well as in the OTA level in kidney and liver (r = 0.319 and r = 0.341, respectively) while the strongest correlation was found between the OTA level in serum and in kidney (r = 0.973). A similar correlation was found by [39]. The effects of OTA appeared to be longer-lasting than those of other mycotoxins, and possessed cumulative feature. Comparison the data obtained in this trial with other recently published data for the occurrence of OTA in pig edible tissues shows that the found levels are comparable with levels in other European countries [24, 39, 40]. However, it should be remembered when comparing data that factors such as climate conditions during harvest, practices for grain/feed storage etc have influence on the ochratoxin A level in edible tissues. The data obtained in this trial show it should be raises some concern for the livestock industry.",

            "text": "The kidney is the main target of OTA, although it has been shown that possible targets of OTA are the liver, the immune system, and brain cells [47\u201349]. This high susceptibility of the kidney is, at least in part, the result of OTA-toxicokinetics. Renal blood flow per tissue weight is extremely high, resulting in the delivery of relative large amounts of OTA as compared to other organs. Furthermore, free OTA is secreted in the proximal tubule and subsequently reabsorbed, mainly in the proximal straight tubule, the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the collecting duct [50\u201356]. Mechanisms involved in reabsorption are, e.g., H+-dipeptide-cotransporter(s) and non-ionic diffusion [52, 55, 56]. These toxicokinetic features result in an accumulation of OTA in renal tissue, where the highest concentrations have been detected in the papilla and the inner medulla [57]. The inhibition of protein synthesis and the damaged energy production in the mitochondria could be considered as the most important factors for degenerative changes in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules where ochratoxin A was detected [58]. While agreeing that the most important toxicological target of OTA in the pig is the kidney, the principal descriptions of the pathology of MPN vary considerably with respect to some other details, and according to the dosing regime and the duration of OTA exposure. Enlarged kidneys are indicative of renal inflammation and proliferative lesions following chronic exposure to OTA [24, 46]. In the present study no association was found between OTA contamination and kidney weight. Twelve (28%) out of 43 \u201cmottled or pale kidneys\u201d samples were found to contain OTA, whereas that in the enlarged kidney was 44.4% in the range 0.17\u201352.5 ng/g. However, the average concentrations of OTA in some feeds for pigs in Serbia (up to 0.25 mg/kg) were substantially lower than the 1\u20132 ppm required to reproduce the classical MPN reported in Denmark. Also, pigs may well contain ochratoxin A in high amounts without any macroscopic chances of the kidneys, as it may take several weeks on ochratoxin A contaminated feeding before porcine nephropathy develops.",

            "text": "Many studies on the role of environmental and host factors have been carried out to elucidate the aetiology of both diseases (BEN and MPN). Such factors include heavy metals [59\u201362] and other minerals [63], bacteria, leptospira, viruses [64, 65], fungal toxins and, recently, Pliocene lignite\u2019s [66], but much stronger evidence support the hypothesis that BEN and MPN have mycotoxic aetiology. It seems, therefore, that MPN observed in Serbia may have a multitoxic aetiology, because it cannot be explained by the concentration of OTA alone. The lack of a strong correlation among histopathological changes and incidence of OTA in kidney (33.3% kidneys samples were positive, at levels ranging up to 52.5 ng/g) found in our trial might thus explain the result of OTA-toxicokinetics as well as possible synergism between OTA and other nephrotoxic mycotoxins or compounds which enhance the toxicity of OTA. Such synergism between OTA and other mycotoxins under field conditions may be responsible for the MPN in Serbia, associated with relatively low mean contamination by OTA in feed. The production of multiple toxins by one or several fungi [67], as is sometimes the natural situation, presents a problem that has not been sufficiently investigated. Considering the similarities with the frequency and levels of OTA reported in other countries, it seems that OTA in Serbian slaughtered pigs represent a particular situation.",

The Serbian control system for content of OTA in pig kidney is not yet established, and can be regarded as a lack from a consumer safety point of view. However, the actual concentration in pork is generally very low and hence for the consumer the contribution to the total intake of ochratoxin A from pig products is very small compared with other sources [68]. The values are far below the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of these toxins [33, 34], but high amounts of very hazardous and relatively heat stable OTA may enter in the food chain without any control system. With the present safety evaluation of ochratoxin A [33, 34], a residue limit of 10 ng/g in pork would not be considered satisfactory from a consumer safety point of view.",

About 50 mL blood/pig was sampled when slaughtered pigs were bled by jugular puncture. Blood samples remained at room temperature for 24 h to allow clotting to occur, and were then centrifuged at 3,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. Serum was decanted and stored at -20 \u00b0C prior to analysis. About 100 g of liver and whole kidney were sampled from each pig.
