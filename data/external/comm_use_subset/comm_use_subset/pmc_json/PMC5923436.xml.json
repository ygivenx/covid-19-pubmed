That it could be of practical use is illustrated by the following episode. In the 1960s, before smallpox had been eradicated from the world, an adult male was found in the busy out-patient department (OPD) of a major London hospital late on a Friday where he had been all afternoon. He said he had just returned from East Africa where smallpox was still endemic and claimed that he had had chickenpox as a child and that he had not been vaccinated. The staff of the OPD were faced with a man with a widespread vesicular skin rash and a slight fever and a dilemma\u2014was this a case of smallpox? Should they alert the media to warn everyone who had been in the OPD to contact their own doctor over the weekend, or was there a way to defuse the situation quickly? One of us (DM), as an electron microscopist at a different London hospital, was telephoned to ask if a quick diagnosis could be made. After advice about collecting specimens, a taxi arrived soon afterwards and a doctor from the other hospital got out, carrying a small syringe containing fluid aspirated from the patient\u2019s vesicles as if it was an unexploded bomb.",

Despite the patient\u2019s claim to have had chickenpox in childhood, it was clear that chickenpox was what he now had. No national alert was necessary, with all the widespread anxiety that would have followed. The speed and certainty of the diagnosis by EM offered a lesson that still has relevance.",

All that is required was an electron microscope, microscope support grids, stain and a competent virologist familiar with the appearance of relevant viruses; (3) That seeing is believing\u2014knowing what the causative virus looks like is a useful confirmation for any other tests added later; (4) That other, more serious, causes could be discounted.",

Nevertheless, some variola virus may yet remain elsewhere, forgotten in a deep-freeze [9] or as dried crusts, and escape, or a virulent variant may be generated through laboratory molecular manipulation. Other viruses also cause vesicular lesions which may mimic smallpox. In addition, other micro-organisms (including several virus families) or some non-infective conditions may cause similar skin lesions as listed in Table 1 and Table 2.",

The widely used VACV \u201cescaped into the wild\u201d and variants of VACV are now globally endemic and are known as buffalopox virus (BPXV) [17,18,19,20,21,22,23]. As well as these, there are poxviruses native to animal species, some of which may infect man but without causing an epidemic. These less pathogenic OPV, as well as VACV, include cowpox virus (CPXV) [24], monkeypox virus (MPXV) [25] and camelpox virus (CMLV) [26,27]. All of them exist in distinct clades and can cause small, regional zoonotic outbreaks even with secondary and tertiary transmissions [23,28,29]. Other members of OPV such as ectromelia virus (mousepox), squirrel- and volepox virus have not been shown to cause infections in humans. In immunocompromised patients, however, all OPV (and other febrile rash agents) can cause severe generalized rashes and systemic disease. The clinical appearances in man and the associated viruses as seen in DEM are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6. OPV virions are large by virus standards and are brick-shaped with short surface protrusions.",

Two virus species of the order Herpesvirales\u2014varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae\u2014frequently cause infections in man. VZV is the cause of the common, and usually mild, chickenpox in children (Figure 10). During the primary infection, VZV enters the sensory root ganglia of the central nervous system where it remains dormant and may emerge again later as shingles (herpes zoster), as shown in Figure 11. This is usually limited to the distribution of one or two sensory nerves, as a painful vesicular eruption with, occasionally, a viral encephalitis. In contrast, there are two types of HSV\u2014Type 1 causes small numbers of vesicles, often on the lips, as Cold Sores (Figure 12), while type 2 is a genital infection. Generally, type 1 occurs above the waist and type 2 below (genital infection, sexually transmitted) but either may be found anywhere on the body. Both infections are normally benign, though irritating to the patient, and often recur. The virions of the two types are indistinguishable by EM. In the immunocompromised, however, both VZV and HSV may cause serious life-threatening infections (Figure 13). Herpesvirus particles contain an icosahedral capsid core, 110 nm in diameter, which contains the DNA genome. This capsid is readily identifiable by its size and shape (Figure 6b, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13b,c and Figure 14e,f) and is surrounded by an amorphous protein coat called the \u201ctegument\u201d and a loosely fitting envelope, 150\u2013180 nm in diameter. The electron-dense stain used in DEM preparation often penetrates the capsid, giving a dark, \u201cempty\u201d appearance. The clinical appearances of chickenpox, shingles and cold sores, with their associated viruses, are shown in Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12 and Figure 13.",

TS-TEM can also be used in DEM, but preparing thin sections is more complex and more time-consuming (for details see [65,74,89,90,91]), making the simple NS the preferable method for DEM. More sophisticated preparation techniques, such as the structure-preserving cryo-TEM, are not required to make the diagnosis and will diminish the essential speed advantage of DEM [73].",

Vesicle fluid or material directly from the base or the \u201croof\u201d of the lesion is collected, and it is prudent to collect at least three replicate samples: for DEM, for NAT, for cell culture or for any necessary confirmatory tests. Essential infection control rules must be observed during collection and transport. Collection with a swab or a sponge is quantitatively disappointing [47]. Alternative methods are:Aspirate fluid from three lesions into a small tuberculin-type syringe with a fine needle (29 gauge is ideal). Carefully re-cap the syringe and place it into a transport container. Cave: Recapping syringes is strictly forbidden in the US for safety reasons (unless it is one-handed or done with a device to hold the cap).Open the surface of a vesicle using a sterile (injection) needle. Collect fluid into a fine glass tube by capillary attraction and close the tube at both ends with dental wax. The wax is removed later in a Laminar Flow Safety Cabinet and the fluid is carefully expelled onto a sheet of ParafilmTM using a small rubber bulb on the \u201cclean\u201d end of the capillary.Open the vesicle as in 2 above. Press the middle of a sterile glass light microscopic slide onto the fluid, remove the slide, let it dry, and mark it on the reverse where the droplet has dried to make finding the sample easier. Place the slide in a Petri dish for transport. To protect the dried fluid during transport, two matchsticks are placed as spacers at the ends of the sample slide which is then covered with another plain slide. Both slides are then bound together using an elastic band at each end.With an open ulcerated lesion or when the base of a vesicle is uncovered, touch a microscope grid briefly onto the base holding it with fine-pointed forceps. Place the grid with specimen side uppermost onto a filter-paper disc placed in a Petri dish. Cover before transporting to the laboratory.",

Doubts were raised when no Treponema pallidum organisms could be demonstrated after several attempts and the patient was referred to hg. Direct touch specimens were taken from the surface (there was no vesicle fluid to collect) and the grids were stained with 2% PTA and disinfected at 60 \u00b0C with formaldehyde-steam for 30 minutes. An hour after the patient\u2019s arrival, abundant brick-shaped structures, 400 \u00d7 250 nm in size, were seen in the EM. Most of them had disintegrated and become flattened (leading to an apparent increase in size), but still revealed details of an inner organization (Figure 15b,c). Despite the poor structural preservation, the size, shape and the internal \u201ctriple coil\u201d, i.e., the DNA-containing inner body, are typical of OPV [92]. The explanation that emerged was that the patient\u2019s daughter had been vaccinated recently and this was probably daughter-to-mother direct transmission [93].

The NS procedure consists of floating the grid with the adhering sample face down on the stain for a few seconds. Next, the grid is removed, surplus stain is drawn off with the torn edge of a piece of filter paper and placed face up on the filter paper in the Petri dish and covered. A few practical hints for preparation are:To avoid cross-contamination use a different pair of forceps for each specimen. Always disinfect and clean the forceps carefully immediately afterwards.The washing steps are helpful in getting an even distribution of stain on the grid. However, each washing step will appreciably reduce the number of particles on the grid.Before staining with UAc, the grid with adherent specimen material must be washed on 3\u20135 droplets of distilled water to remove interfering phosphate ions. Successful NS with PTA does not require extensive washing; washing on a single droplet will suffice.While checking the first grid in the TEM, the remaining specimen, the washing and stain droplets are left on the ParafilmTM, protected from dust and drying in the wet chamber. This helps to shorten preparation time in case further preparations, possibly stained differently, are needed.Viruses and other biologicals will concentrate at the interface between the air and the sample fluid [103]. Letting the sample droplet remain untouched for a few minutes (or even longer, e.g., overnight at 4 \u00b0C in the refrigerator, if found necessary) before the grid is placed onto it for adsorption can help with low-concentration samples.With sample volumes below 5 \u00b5L the sample may be placed directly onto the grid\u00b4s surface for adsorption.While PTA staining tends to make biological structures more labile and porous, UAc is both a stain and a fixative [104]. When one stain does not result in a satisfactory preparation, the other usually does. Therefore, with unknown samples it may be advisable to use both stains in parallel. Preparations stained with either stain tend to deteriorate in the course of a fortnight. A loss of fine structure and the appearance of larger stain crystals (\u201cgrain\u201d) can be avoided by storing \u201cvaluable\u201d grids in vacuo in a desiccator containing some phospho-pentoxide as a desiccant. As well as these two common stains, a number of alternatives, e.g., ammonium molybdate, sodium silico-tungstate and uranyl formate have also been used successfully [90,98,105]. All three excel by a very fine \u201cgrain\u201d and ammonium molybdate in addition by a well-balanced contrast.",

With cases of serious, life-threatening illness or from a post-mortem or where an agent liable to cause an epidemic may be involved, the samples should be inactivated using, e.g., a structure-preserving and efficient aldehyde disinfection scheme such as that detailed by M\u00f6ller et al.

When, however, the presence of smallpox or another life-threatening Class 3 agent is suspected, samples may have to be sent to a National Central Public Health Laboratory, where special safety precautions are in force to protect the public. The safe handling of organisms liable to cause a serious epidemic will be governed by local Governmental regulations, which should be observed, preferably with any course of action agreed beforehand.",

Likewise, Centralized Imaging Facilities at Universities can also take on DEM when, in an emergency, a rapid catch-all diagnosis is required. In addition, DEM will help to shorten cell culture investigations in novel situations, as happened in 2003 during the SARS outbreak.

It is done using a non-wetting surface, such as a sheet of ParafilmTM, and comprises the following steps: adsorption, washing and staining. A hydrophilic EM support grid is placed on a droplet of the diagnostic suspension (left) and after 30 s of adsorption is transferred quickly onto a series of droplets of distilled water to remove interfering salts, and then onto a droplet of \u201cstain\u201d. The \u201cstains\u201d used are electron-dense solutions: 0.5 to 2.0 percent of a heavy metal salt, such as PTA, routinely buffered to pH 7.2 (may be used between pH 5 to pH 10), UAc, unbuffered at a pH around 4.2, or other stains can be used. During a short, 5\u201310 s staining step, the stain does not react with the chemical moieties of the biologicals on the grid, i.e., there is no \u201cpositive staining\u201d effect as there is in thin section-TEM. This rapid process results in \u201cnegative contrast\u201d, as the transparent biological structures of the sample, after drying, are closely surrounded by the electron-dense stain.
