While there is no shortage of manual sample preparation methods for use in reference or hospital laboratories [12\u201319], the specific combination of M. tuberculosis and primary (raw) sputum presents a number of technical and logistical challenges for automated sample preparation systems and sample-to-answer diagnostic devices because sputum is a complex, viscous, clumpy and non-homogenous sample that contains mucus, human cells, non-target bacteria and viruses, blood and pus [17, 20, 21], and the M. tuberculosis cell wall is difficult to lyse with chemical-based nucleic acid extraction kits [22\u201325]. For these reasons, mechanical sample homogenization and cell lysis (sonication, bead beating or bead blending) are often used to prepare sputum samples for nucleic acid tests, as these methods tend to improve DNA recovery relative to purely chemical or enzymatic processes [12, 17, 19, 22, 23, 26].",

Even in high resource settings and within the context of centralized testing labs, then, there is still a need for a simple, flexible, automated nucleic acid extraction system that can process raw sputum. The objectives of this work were therefore to 1) design and develop a prototype benchtop, automated nucleic acid workstation with an integrated mechanical homogenizer/lysis function that would meet many of the user needs or requirements defined by the TB community (as summarized in [2, 4]); 2) optimize an automated extraction protocol for raw sputum that generates purified DNA suitable for down-stream nucleic acid amplification and analysis; 3) establish analytical performance metrics for the system and method; and 4) evaluate the system behavior and potential clinical utility on primary sputum specimens, with an emphasis on known or suspected TB-positive patients.",

Briefly, the concept involves separating the consumable from the energy-transducing mechanism\u2013in this case, a rotating cylindrical magnet that is external to the lysis tubes (or reagent plate). At high rotational speeds, the external magnet induces the rotation of a small magnetic stir disc inside of each lysis tube, which in turn agitates the solid particles. Particle agitation is controlled by adjusting the speed of the external, rotating magnet. Magnetically-induced vortexing (MagVor) therefore generates a chaotic bead-milling or bead beating effect within the sample using simple hardware components and with minimal heat generated in the solution. Adjacent to the rotating magnet is a motorized carriage with integrated heater that holds all consumables for the extraction including sample lysis tubes, heater tubes, and a 96-well reagent plate. The carriage controls the position of the consumables relative to a fixed-position, 8-channel, custom-built pipetting manifold. The pipetting manifold (with attached TruTips) moves vertically up and down and a positive-displacement syringe pump controls the speed and aspiration/dispense volumes across all eight tips simultaneously. Pipetting speed is used as a proxy and means for controlling flow rate through the TruTip matrix. A selection valve and small air pump control air flow to the individual tips to dry the silica binding matrix after wash steps and before nucleic acid elution. Biosafety concerns were (partially) addressed in the prototype workstation by incorporating a HEPA-filtered exhaust fan and enclosure around the moving parts and consumables, creating a negative pressure air box relative to the operating environment. Electronic components were protected from potential liquid splashes by protective covers that can be wiped down with bleach or other disinfectants. The prototype was also designed to fit within a standard Biosafety cabinet if needed or desired.",
