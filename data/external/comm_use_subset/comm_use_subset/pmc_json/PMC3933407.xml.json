The overall process involves the Knoevenagel condensation of Meldrum's acid with 1H-indole-2,3-dione followed by \u201cin situ\u201d Michael addition of malononitrile/ethyl cyanoacetate in single operation to give spiro(indole-pyranodioxine) derivatives similar to the earlier reports [24, 25] of the formation of spiroindoles in the reaction of 3-carboethoxycyanomethylene-2H-indol-2-ones with cyclic ketones under classical conditions (Scheme 1). The process described here offers rapid facile one-pot synthesis of spiroindole derivatives using easily recyclable ZnO nanoparticles. This process is cost effective and hence ecofriendly as it is one-pot synthesis with easy workup and does not require harsh reagents. The process developed by us requires less quantity of catalyst (30 mg) for carrying out the catalytic reaction, thus decreasing the amount of effluent to considerable level.",

In a typical synthesis, zinc acetate dihydrate, CTAB, and sodium hydroxide were mixed (molar ratio 1 : 0.4 : 3) and ground together in an agate mortar for 50 min at room temperature (25\u00b0C). The reaction started readily during the mixing process, accompanied by the release of heat. The mixture was washed with distilled water in an ultrasonic bath. Finally, the product was dried in air at 60\u00b0C for 2 hrs. ",
