Various catalytic activities have been assigned for the 2H enzymes: hydrolysis of a 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate, in either nucleotides or 3\u2032-ends of RNA molecules, into 2\u2032-phosphate [3\u20135], hydrolysis of ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032,2\u2032\u2032-cyclic phosphates into ADP-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphate [6\u20138], generation and/or cleavage of 2\u2032-5\u2032-linkages between nucleotides or RNA molecules, such as tRNA halves [3,9\u201313], and 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonucleolytic removal of terminal uridine nucleotides from snRNA with the simultaneous generation of 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphates at the terminus [14]. The structurally best-characterized 2H enzyme is the mammalian myelin enzyme 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) [15\u201319], but even for this enzyme, the biological function remains enigmatic [5].",

A genomic knockout of LigT in E. coli did not obviously affect cellular growth or viability in laboratory conditions, while LigT overexpression produced a phenotype sensitive to elevated temperature [9]. A LigT orthologue in Deinococcus radiodurans was massively upregulated after acute irradiation, and it was speculated to function in the handling of damaged RNA species [21].",

We extend the previous study here, providing high-resolution crystallographic data and different active-site ligand complexes. Comparisons to the apo form of the enzyme determined in the current work allow the highlighting of conformational changes and binding determinants of the reactive species. Based on further comparisons to mouse CNPase, we also modelled the substrate complex of LigT and discuss unique features of each protein. An extended binding surface for RNA substrates is also identified, which possibly involves flexible loops of the 2H family. All in all, we provide novel data on the structure-function relationships in a bacterial 2H enzyme, which can be used to understand the common and divergent properties of enzymes in the entire 2H superfamily.",

As in other 2H family members, the active site has 2-fold symmetry; this symmetry also includes the 4 water molecules at the bottom of the active site, connecting the active-site \u03b2 strands through water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Fig 1B). These water molecules coordinate the substrate/product throughout the reaction in CNPase [17,18], and they are likely to play a similar role in LigT and other 2H phosphoesterases. The strict conservation of the active-site water structure between 2H enzymes is remarkable, taking into account the amino acid sequence identity of slightly above 10% between CNPase and LigT.",

The binding mode is similar to that seen before, and the 2\u2032-AMP ligand is well defined in one of the two LigT monomers, while the occupancy in the other monomer is low. Binding involves aromatic stacking of the nucleotide base against Phe48 and a C-H\u2026\u03c0 interaction between the ribose ring and Phe8. In addition to the catalytic residues, Arg130 plays a key role in coordinating the phospho moiety of the product. Considering reaction geometry, a water molecule coordinated by His125 in the apo structure can now be designated as the nucleophilic water (Fig 2A), analogously to CNPase. The complex also proves that LigT has CNPase activity towards 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic mononucleotides, since the reaction product is bound in the crystals grown in the presence of the substrate.",

The fact that they bind the active site can imply that they may be weak inhibitors, and it can be taken as evidence of a general propensity to bind nucleotides in the active site. The LigT orthologue protein PF0027 from Pyrococcus furiosus was shown to require a GTP cofactor for the RNA ligation reaction [3], while for the E. coli enzyme, such a cofactor has not been reported. Although we attempted crystallization in the presence of GTP as with ATP, no corresponding GTP electron density was found in the resulting crystals (data not shown). Two similar datasets were collected with ATP, one of which has one ATP bound to only one of the 2 monomers in the asymmetric unit. This ATP molecule probably has a partial occupancy and/or some degree of flexibility, as evidenced by residual difference electron density. The major conformation was built in the structure. The other complex has three ATP molecules for two monomers; the space group remains the same. The reason for this fortuituous ambiguity is unknown. In addition to the ligand in both active sites (Fig 2B), another ATP in the latter crystal form is bound in the vicinity of it in one monomer; this ATP is also involved in crystal contacts. The binding of this second ATP is a strong indication of a propensity for binding further nucleotides in the active site vicinity by E. coli LigT. Residues interacting with the second ATP include Phe159 and Arg6. Again, the \u03b1-5\u2032-phosphate of the active-site ATP is in the same location as the corresponding phosphate in NADP+, and it is similarly coordinated by Arg6, highlighting putative RNA recognition features extending from the active site.",

LigT was monomeric in solution, and the obtained 3D shape corresponded closely to that seen in the crystal structure (Chi2 = 0.8 between experimental SAXS data and calculated data from a LigT monomer). An exception was the highest concentration (>15 mg/ml), which fitted well to a dimeric species; the relevance of this dimerization is not known, and we believe it was an artifact of the very high concentration. tRNA is slightly larger and more elongated than LigT, as expected. A multiphase ab initio modeling approach, taking advantage of the different X-ray scattering properties of RNA and protein, based on SAXS data from the complex and both components alone was employed, and an elongated complex (Fig 6C) fit the experimental data well. The result is a clear indication of the ability of LigT to bind RNA molecules, in this case specifically tRNA. Furthermore, the good fit of the 1:1 complex to the experimental data and the volume of the corresponding ab initio model both imply that the sample was mostly in complex form, with free LigT and tRNA not interfering with SAXS analysis. Whether tRNA would be a true biological substrate or ligand for LigT, is unclear at present, and remains a subject for future work. The fact that tRNA was not observed in the crystal structure can be explained by the commercial yeast tRNA preparation being a mixture of different tRNAs, not homogeneous enough to support crystallization of the complex.",

Structural data [29] from these enzymes incidate that the 2\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine bisphophate substrate binds along the opposite side of the active site, compared to LigT and CNPase (Fig 7A). In CNPase, the side used for 2\u2032,5\u2032-adenosine bisphophate in these enzymes is blocked by the \u03b17 helix, which coordinates the nucleophilic water. In LigT, this opposite side is open, and there would be room for a larger nucleophile than water, even though recent data suggest that short RNA molecules would not act as nucleophiles in LigT [22]. The central phosphate moiety sits nearly identically on top of the HxTx motifs, however. Combining both binding modes by superposition, interesting conservation can be observed (Fig 7A). For example, LigT Trp82 is in a perfect position to stack against a base, and Arg120 is conserved. In the NADP+ complex, we actually observe unidentified electron density of a stacking interaction, modeled as a fragment of NADP+, on top of Trp82, which could reflect low-affinity binding of some moiety in NADP+. These observations highlight several possible sites for interaction between phosphate, sugar, and base moieties in RNA with residues lining the active-site groove in LigT.",

The ligation was later found to be reversible, as the enzyme additionally functions as a 2\u2032-5\u2032-phosphodiesterase [3,9]. Recently, however, concomitant with the publication of the first E. coli LigT structure, this view was challenged, as LigT did not appear to ligate short 10-nucleotide RNA oligomers with 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate and 5\u2032-hydroxyl ends, but only acted on the cyclic phosphate [22]. Thus, LigT was claimed to be a CNPase rather that RNA ligase. It should be noted that the experimental conditions in the different studies varied, and it is hard to draw a definite conclusion at this point. Our structural data do highlight close structural similarities of bacterial LigT to RNA ligases and clear differences with respect to the vertebrate CNPase active site.",

For obtaining liganded complexes, LigT was mixed with putative active-site ligands prior to crystallization at 5 mM ligand concentration; these compounds included ATP, NADP+, 2\u2032,3\u2032-cAMP, and 3\u2032-AMP. Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking them for a few minutes in the well solution supplemented with the ligand (if present) and 15% (v/v) PEG 200. X-ray diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. Data were collected on beamlines P11 and P13 [37] at PETRA III/DESY (Hamburg, Germany), as well as on beamline I911-2 at MAX-Lab (Lund, Sweden). All data were processed using XDS [38].",
