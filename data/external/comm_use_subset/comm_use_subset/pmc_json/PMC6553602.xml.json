Despite numerous publications assessing the risk factors for viral spillovers, published studies have tended to miss out quantitative estimation of their frequency and characteristics and causal links among different host species. In this study, we provide quantitative analysis of external forcing of infection, as applied to Lassa haemorrhagic fever (LF), a widespread disease in West Africa. The proposed modelling framework can be further extended to other diseases with common characteristics and viewed as key in light of anticipated emergence of a novel infectious disease in the future\u2014the \u2018Disease X\u2019 as it was recently coined by the World Health Organization.",

            "text": "LF virus was first discovered in 1969, but its presence can be traced back for centuries [4]. Current viral hotspots are focused on West African countries, namely, Nigeria, Guinea, Benin, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The animal reservoir of the virus is Mastomys natalensis, also known as multimammate mouse, which is a rodent species that is widespread in the region. Although the main transmission route remains zoonotic, i.e. animal-to-human, contracting the virus through exposure to contaminated excreta or secretions from rodents [5], another frequently reported route is human-to-human transmission, via contact exposure to the virus from the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. The latter contributes to approximately 19% of all reported cases and is usually observed during nosocomial outbreaks [6]. Hence, the overall transmission pattern is primarily driven by environmental exposure to LF [3] rather than sustained human-to-human transmission chains, being different from Ebola virus disease [7]. Given the importance of the human\u2013animal interface, we anticipate that environmental factors may be crucial driving forces contributing to the frequent recurrence of LF outbreaks.",

Because higher estimates of the CFR are likely due to underreporting and ascertainment bias, we are able to account for this observational matter and estimate an underreporting factor. Similarly to our recent work [11], we assume that fatal cases are certainly reported in the surveillance system throughout the whole year, while less severe, non-lethal cases are likely to be missed. Such variation may especially be the case during low-risk periods, when LF infections are not frequently reported.",

The formulation resulted in two Poisson- and binomially distributed likelihood functions for describing the LF incidence and mortality, respectively (electronic supplementary material, appendix B). We identified two distinct periods of a year which were separately analysed owing to considerably different levels of observed transmission activity: (i) a low-risk period with a weekly exposure rate of 6.4 (CrI: 0\u201332.5; maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE): 9.6) lasting from week 9 (26 February to 4 March in 2018, CrI: 5\u201313) to week 50 (10 December to 16 December in 2018; CrI: 47\u201352), and (ii) the rest of the year, characterized by a higher risk of contracting the virus, with the average weekly exposure rate reaching 24.7 (CrI: 0\u2013111.7; MLE: 38.1), which exceeded the low-risk period by approximately four times. The CFR was estimated at 4.9% (CrI: 0\u201354.4; MLE: 8.9%). If we assume the unbiased value of the CFR at 2%, the reporting coverage can be estimated to be as low as 40%. The overlaid incidence data and variations in the parameter estimates are shown in figure 1. For comparison, an analogous model with a single (constant) exposure rate yielded a less plausible fit to the data (Akaike information criterion (AIC) values: 3679.2 for a single- and 2877.2 for a two-period model).\n",

The LF incidence in humans which is thought to correlate with the LF level of infection in rodents controversially peaks in the first two to three months of the year.

This was also confirmed by the start and end times of the high/low exposure periods, which approximately coincide with the start and the end of the rainy season (cf. figure 1b; electronic supplementary material, figure S4).

The high-risk period spanned the last month of the year to the second to third month of the year. The relative risk of acquiring LF infection during the high-risk period was five times greater than during the rest of the year. In our search for a possible explanation, we identified that the rainfall pattern was negatively and highly correlated with LF incidence. The rainfall does not affect the transmissibility of the virus directly, but it is noteworthy that rodents migrate to within close proximity to human settlements to breed and hibernate during the dry season. This in turn leads to an increase in the contact rate of humans with rodents, and as a consequence, a higher probability of acquiring LF infection.",

The migration of rodents was notified as a main factor in another report [23]. Our findings confirm the importance of the combined effect of these two factors on the seasonality of LF epidemics and offer a quantitative estimation of their strength, which has never to our knowledge been done in the past. When the rainy season ends in November, the breeding season for rodents starts about two months later. At that time, newly born offspring and scarcity of food on the ground force mature rodents to approach human-occupied areas. Consequently, this may lead to a rise in the contact frequency between humans and infected rodents. This high-exposure frequency persists until the rainy season starts again the following year, at which point the rodents migrate back to the ground and we observe the subsequent decline in human cases of LF. These findings highlight the importance of seasonal ecology of animal hosts in explaining the seasonality of LF epidemics. Similar findings have been reported for many other diseases, not only for those of an epizootic nature, e.g. [24,25], but also for insect-vectored plant diseases [26]. This points to rather general applicability of our approach that may frame the spillovers of other pathogens with two epizootic transmission routes. An important achievement of the present study was that we were able to offer quantitative estimates of the impact of the two risk factors, rainfall pattern and migration of rodents, on the exposure probability of humans to LF infection.",

We can then express the total exposure rate ew solely through the exposure rate aw such that: ew = aw/(1 \u2212 r).

The single filled circle indicates that the measured causality is significantly better than the null expectation (p < 0.01). As for the use of convergent cross-mapping, please see literature [20,21].
