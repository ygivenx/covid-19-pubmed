As of August 31st 2016, the virus has infected 1,800 humans, with about 35% mortality rate, in 27 countries1. The newly emerging virus has been majorly causing human infections in countries in the Middle East, and cases outside the area are related to travelers to Arabian Peninsula or their contacts (Mailles et al., 2013; Bialek et al., 2014; Bin et al., 2016). Despite the limited human to human transmission, the high mortality rate and a recent large nosocomial outbreak in South Korea in 2015 confers a burden that the virus could efficiently transmit in the social community with severe disease outcomes. Thus, the development of effective therapeutics and rapid diagnostic tools are urgently needed to control the spread of MERS-CoV. However, due to the limitations to rapid development of vaccines and specific antiviral drugs for the newly emerging virus, diagnosis is the key to prevent or delay the viral spread.",

These protocols allow for in vitro amplification of specific gene, thus enabling an accurate diagnosis of clinical isolates from patients. Indeed, a sensitive molecular detection for MERS-CoV was achieved by using the upstream of the envelope E (upE) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a (Memish et al., 2014; Shirato et al., 2014). Nevertheless, according to the 2013 WHO announcement for MERS-CoV positive detection 2, it is still necessary to develop as many specific genetic targets as possible, to allow reliable MERS-CoV diagnoses.",

LAMP has especially attracted considerable interest since it is a potentially comparable to the popular detection methods such as conventional PCR and real-time PCR, in terms of specificity and sensitivity. For example, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic bacteria genome markers have been used for the LAMP-based amplification assay (Aoi et al., 2006; Arunrut et al., 2016). LAMP protocol can also be applied for the detection of RNA viruses, including the SARS corona virus (Hong et al., 2004), influenza viruses (Poon et al., 2005), and other infectious respiratory viruses, by merging the reverse transcription steps into the LAMP processes (Parida et al., 2005). To date, RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for detection of MERS-CoV RNA, targets within the ORF 1a and ORF1b genes and upstream of the E gene (Bhadra et al., 2015). The researchers are able to improve their RT-LAMP by monitoring the real-time fluorescent signal using the lab-scale PCR machine, but are still limited by the need for gel electrophoresis imaging system, expensive thermal cyclers, and the time-consuming technique.",

Two additional loop primers (LF and LB) were used to enhance the LAMP reaction. The standardized dsDNA (1 ng/\u03bcL of MERS-CoV viral N gene) was used. The sequences of the primers and their locations are indicated in Figure 2B, and Table 1. According to the previous study of LAMP assays (Kuboki et al., 2003; Parida et al., 2008), typical thymine spacers were used to enhance LAMP efficiency by assisting the loop formation. Hwang et al. (Yang et al., 2010) investigated the effects of LAMP amplification associated by inserting T-bases into the FIP and BIP, which suggested that the LAMP primer containing T4 linker sequences would be greater than the conventional PCR method. However, in our experiment, the T4 linker didn\u2019t seem to affect gene amplification, and its use was rather a failure in LAMP reaction. Supplementary Figure S2 shows the experimental results for the LAMP amplification depending on the primer configurations (P1, P1-T4, P2, and P2-T4). The experimental verification of the LAMP primer performance was critical for the successful amplification. Agarose gel electrophoresis and SYBR green I visible evidence (UV on/off) show that the P1 primer compositions contain the typical LAMP signature, as shown in Figure 2C. Moreover, there is only one mismatch in the essential F2, B2, and B3 regions, compared to the individual sequences of the other MERS-CoV (Figure 2A). Thus, the Primer 1 set (P1) was selected for further investigations. We believe that the LAMP primer set utilized in this study is available to detect MERS-CoV N gene as a universal element in LAMP assay.",

The positive reaction was clearly observed in the 4 RNA copies of MERS-CoV RNA sample in the optimized RT-LAMP reaction, using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, UV and naked eye (Figures 4A,B). Although both the conventional RT-PCR and qRT-PCR detected up to the 4 RNA copies of MERS-CoV RNA sample, the RT-LAMP method reduced the detection time up to 100 min, as compared to the conventional methods (Figures 4C,D).

All signal read-outs were distinguished after amplification between positive and negative results in end-point analysis by adding 2 \u03bcL of SYBR-green I dye to the LAMP reactants. Although the SYBR-green I based end-point signal read-out is more robust and effective than the fluorescent and naked-eye LAMP detection, the difficulty exists in applying in one-pot analysis, since the highly concentrated SYBR-green I dye is a strong inhibitor of DNA polymerase activity during the thermal cycling process. In order to study the effect of the SYBR-green concentration on one-pot RT-LAMP reaction, different concentrations were introduced into the mixture prior to the RT-LAMP amplification. As presented in Supplementary Figure S5, the electrophoresis gel data clearly confirm that successful RT-LAMP amplification achieved in the range 0 \u223c 50X concentrated SYBR-green. However, as expected, we found that the fluorescent SYBR-green I signal observed in the highly concentrated solutions (100 \u223c 1000X) failed to represent any significant correlation between the LAMP-amplification and positive response. Even the signal difference between positive and negative samples was not obvious at maximum SYBR-green I concentration (50X, not inhibited to LAMP amplification). This suggests that an alternative detection method should be adopted to realize the one-pot RT-LAMP reaction.",

In this study, the one-pot RT-LAMP assay for detection of MERS-CoV was designed using EvaGreen modified microchamber method for visualizing the resultant signal. SYBR-green and EvaGreen are well known DNA-intercalating dyes for PCR.

Also, the optimized RT-LAMP is as sensitive as the conventional RT-PCR and Real-Time qRT-PCR method (Figure 8), which is believed to be one of the most sensitive methods developed so far. The N gene of MERS-CoV used as the target for RT-LAMP detection is one of the recommended regions for MERS-CoV detection 6. Although the replication mechanism of MERS-CoV has not been fully understood, coronavirus is believed to generate six subgenome-length mRNAs (Zaki et al., 2012; Mailles et al., 2013; Bialek et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2014), all of which contain the N gene region (Corman et al., 2014; Shirato et al., 2014). The subgenomic mRNAs preferably exist within the virally infected cells, and not outside the cells. However, the clinical specimens include not only MERS-CoV virions, but also infected host cells probably containing the subgenomic mRNAs, implying the possible enhancement of RT-LAMP detection targeting the N gene.
