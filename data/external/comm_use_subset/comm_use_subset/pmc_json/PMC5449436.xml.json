As a direct consequence, European laboratories in which infectious microorganisms are manipulated were confronted to a drastic increase in biosafety/biosecurity regulations. Useful information is available in websites of the agencies in charge of specific aspects, however, its diversity led to difficulties to comply with all these rules. Moreover, regulations can be different in European Union (EU) Member State countries and despite efforts of national agencies to place online specific information, European laboratories working with infectious pathogens are confronted to a large number of complex rules and regulations.",

Before the era of containment laboratories, the 10 microorganisms responsible for >50% of LAI were brucellosis, Q fever, viral hepatitis, typhoid fever, tularemia, tuberculosis, dermatomycoses, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, psittacosis, and coccidioidomycosis (6). Byers and Harding reported that 85% of LAI were caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Coxiella burnetii, hantaviruses, arboviruses, hepatitis B and C viruses, Brucella spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Cryptosporidium spp. (7). In the USA, from 2004 to 2010, only 11 LAIs were reported to CDC for microorganisms listed as Biological Select Agents and Toxins (8): six cases due to Brucella spp., four cases due to Francisella tularensis, and one case due to Coccidioides immitis/posadasii (9). Although there is no harmonized system for the reporting of laboratory incidents and accidents at the EU level, few LAIs have been described in European laboratories during the last decade highlighting a drastic reduction of these accidents in CL-3 laboratories (5). Doubtless, current practices have also minimized worker\u2019s pathogen exposition and improvements in containment equipment, engineering controls, and safety training contributed greatly to this reduction.",

The other routes of infection are percutaneous inoculation (needlestick injuries, broken glass injury, and/or animal bites or scratches) and LAIs due to smoking eating, or accidental aspiration through a pipette has now disappeared because of banishment of these practices (3, 10). Actually, the risk assessment related to microorganisms manipulated in CL-3 laboratories has to consider the possible route of transmission as well as the minimal infective dose for humans (11). Consequently, specific biosafety measures in addition to general conception of laboratory facilities must be enforced (12).",

            "text": "Since 1999, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined three groups of potential bioterrorism biological (A, B, and C) and the European Commission formed a task force on bioterrorism, which became operational in May 2002 and defined two groups of potential bioterrorism biological agents, high and very high threat.1 Similarly, Russia evaluated the potential bioterrorism agents and identified three groups of potential bioterrorism agents (groups 1, 2, and 3) (13). From 2001, France has implemented a regulation system to register facilities possessing substances from the list of the microorganisms and toxins (MOTs). The scope of the legislation was the control of MOTs use which was likely to be a public health risk and the new regulatory framework was applicable to all French laboratories involved in any operation using MOTs for diagnostic, research, development, or teaching purposes. The list mentions high-risk agents/toxins that have been determined to have potential for use as bioweapons and were subject to more drastic measures concerning their acquisition and handling (French Decree of June 30, 2010). It is important to specify that this list included genetic material (DNA or RNA) less than 500 nucleotides in length or toxins, protein toxin fragments containing fewer than 167 amino acids. The extension of such regulation concerning non-infectious materials is unique to France. These measures were enforced in French academic laboratories with an update list of pathogens classified as MOT in the order of April 30, 2012 (French Order of April 30, 2012). Every year, laboratories have to report to the Agence national de Securit\u00e9 du M\u00e9dicament et des Produits de Sant\u00e9 (ANSM, the French Biosafety/Biosecurity Agency) an inventory of MOT samples. Legal MOT obligations led to additional difficulties when animal experiments are planned with these pathogens knowing that corresponding A-3-facility (for \u201cAnimal facility-level 3\u201d) and biologists have to follow the same regulations. Moreover, French laboratories using MOT pathogens were also identified as ZRR (for \u201cZone \u00e0 R\u00e9gime Restrictif\u201d; restricted access area) area. This ZRR classification was based in the order of July 3, 2012, which defined four risks for the nation (R1\u2013R4): (i) the risk of violation of economic interests (R1); (ii) the risk of abuses of defense capabilities (R2); (iii) the risk of proliferation (R3); and (iv) the risk of terrorism (R4). Under institutional supervision, the \u201cdirector of such ZRR laboratories (which may be subject to criminal sanction for not complying with the law and instructions) must set up the monitoring of any person who wishes to join a research team and therefore work inside the research unit\u201d (16).",

Some countries (France, United Kingdom, Germany, etc.) have adopted regulations, rules, or guidelines, and there are several ISO/EN standards available in the EU that can be applied for containment laboratory planning, construction, and operation. In addition, European standards have been developed for biosafety equipment, e.g., autoclaves, biosafety cabinets (BSCs), and personal protective equipment (PPE), but regular oversight and recertification are guided by national specifications (17).",

This minimum ventilation flow recommendation corresponds to about 9.1 air change hour (ACH) for a 9-foot ceiling or an 8.2 ACH rate for a 10-foot ceiling space. Based on risk assessment and general practices, air change rates are often set to a single value between 6 and 12 ACH for most CL-3 laboratories. Ventilation rates in animal facilities usually range 10\u201315 ACH. The laboratory quality stepwise implementation tool (WHO, 2015) recommended a minimum of six ACH for CL-3 facilities. This minimum air flow shall be maintained permanently, whether the laboratory is used for experiments or not. Ventilation rates were established not only for efficient prevention of airborne contamination but also for odor control in the laboratory air space. Airflow in CL-3 facilities shall be designed to move from \u201cclean\u201d areas toward the biocontainment space. A negative pressure differential of 12.5 Pa (0.05 in w.g.) must be maintained between each pressure zone following the laboratory quality stepwise implementation tool (WHO, 2015) or US recommendations (19). For CL-3 laboratories containing multiple zones, greater negative pressure must be established in high-risk rooms. For ensuring the pressure differential in all containment rooms, specific monitoring and control devices shall be provided as well as visual readout, alarm devices at the entrance of the containment space, in anterooms, or at entrance of the individual rooms within the containment suite. In fact, multiple possible designs exist for CL-3 laboratories (12, 20), which facilities should be verified at least annually with the minimum facility verification requirements described in Table 1.",

Rather, the procedure was defined to reach a potential surviving of microorganism less than one in one million (106) at the end of the process.

When using a CL-3 autoclave it is imperative that pathogens do not escape through the autoclave doors\u2014either via poorly designed gaskets or by inadvertently opening the doors simultaneously.

Although these regulations have improved biologists, population, and environmental protection, they also led to difficulties for many CL-3 laboratories in relation with a large increase in the administrative burden. Moreover, implementation of these new regulations was costly, time-consuming, and generates disparities between CL-3 laboratories working or not with MOTs, since the latter are not subject to systematic control or inspections. All operations involving MOTs, including production, manufacture, transport, import, export, retention, supply, sale, purchase, and use are regulated (33). It was also important to note that French laboratories working on MOTs had to validate their surface or air-borne surface disinfection processes to follow ANSM requirements. Moreover, a CL-3 laboratory using RG3 genetically modified organism needs to obtain a license for their manipulations. This license was granted after an evaluation by the French HCB and must be registered by the police for a validity period of 5 years.",

However, progressively, these rules have become more and more complex for people designing or managing CL-3. Moreover, a lack of harmonization of practical guidance ant the development of specific national regulations based on EU Directives (27) led to difficulties in their implementations. French CL-3 laboratories were good examples as they were recently impacted and confronted to exhaustive regulations concerning MOTs without international harmonization. The complexity of the situation to integrate and comply with all these new regulations is not only time- and cost-consuming for laboratories but it can also be counterproductive face to international concurrence. At the same time, there was a growing need to manipulate pathogenic MOTs in academic laboratories for fundamental research purposes, diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines development. However, due to a non-harmonization concerning CL-3 facilities management (design, construction, conformity, and maintenance), it was sometimes difficult for European professional to have a clear and concise overview of essential aspects to consider. This limitation could be problematic not only for new CL-3 laboratories conception (and future substantial cost in case of non-conformity) but also in terms of biosafety and biosecurity if the referential was unclear. Since many years, CL-3 facilities were yet described on international literature but generally these works focused on partial or general considerations with no detailed and practical information. Based on French specificities but also on essential technical aspects and EU Directives, this review resumes biosafety/biosecurity measures concerning CL-3 facilities. Essential CL-3 requirements and French/European standards have been compiled to manipulated safely risk group 3 biological agents in compliance with the legislation. Clarification of optimal biosafety and biosecurity requirements should be useful to any laboratories working with RG3 biological agents in France but also in Europe.",
