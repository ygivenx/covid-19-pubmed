            "text": "Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a membrane-bound serine protease that preferentially cleaves the peptide bond after the penultimate proline residue (1). Its catalytic domain is located extracellularly, anchored to the membrane by a single transmembrane domain. DPP-IV dimerization is essential for its enzymatic activity (2\u20134). The substrates of DPP-IV are small oligopeptides, including hormones, chemokines, and neuropeptides (5\u20138). DPP-IV is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. Interestingly, the enzymatic activity of DPP-IV is reduced in the sera of patients with melanomas or oral cancers (9, 10). Attenuated DPP-IV expression on the cell surface is also observed in malignant cells, such as melanomas and lung nonadenocarcinomas (10\u201315). In melanocytes, the elimination of DPP-IV occurs concomitantly with growth factor independence (14, 15). Re-expression of DPP-IV in these melanoma cells suppresses the malignant phenotype of the melanocytic cells (16). In human nonadenocarcinoma cancers, the enzymatic activity and expression of DPP-IV is dramatically reduced compared with those in normal bronchial and lung alveolar epithelia (11). Interestingly, the reexpression of DPP-IV in lung cancer cells inhibits tumor events, such as cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, and tumorigenicity, in nude mice (17). The mechanisms of DPP-IV downregulation and tumor growth in these tissues are not yet clear.",

            "text": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a powerful mitogen, stimulating cell proliferation (18, 19). A single polypeptide of 70 amino acids, IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) with high affinity (20, 21). The biological function of IGF-1 is mediated through IGF-1R tyrosine kinase signaling. IGF-1R phosphorylates several downstream adaptor proteins, thus activating distinct downstream signaling pathways, including the AKT, RAF, and MAPK pathways (22). The physiological concentration of IGF-1 is tightly regulated. The total concentration of IGF-1 in the blood is 10\u201340 nM (23\u201325). The IGF-1 concentration is controlled by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which bind free IGF-1 (23\u201325). Among these, IGFBP3 is the main IGF-1-sequestering protein, because of its abundance and high affinity for IGF-1 (21, 26). The remaining free IGF-1 constitutes less than 1% of the total IGF-1 concentration (23, 26). Given the tight binding between IGF-1 and IGFBPs (Kd=0.06\u20130.22 nM) (21), the sequestering of IGF-1 by IGFBPs effectively reduces the amount of IGF-1 available to activate IGF-1R. In this way, IGFBPs negatively regulate the bioavailability of IGF-1.",

Additional purification was performed with ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. An FAP expression plasmid for insect cells was constructed as described previously (28). FAP was purified with His Bind Resin (Novagen) and HiTrap Q Sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). Specifically, the culture medium of High FiveTM cells expressing FAP was collected and the protein precipitated by the addition of 3.8 M ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation.

The purified proteins had activities similar to those reported previously (2, 3). FAP is a protease highly homologous to DPP-IV, with 50% sequence identity and structural similarity (28). Therefore, the cleavage of IGF-1 by FAP was also investigated. First, the peptide GPETLCGAEL (the first 10 amino acids at the N-terminus of IGF-1) was incubated with DPP-IV. HPLC analysis identified the dipeptide Gly\u2013Pro and the octapeptide ETLCGAEL as the products of DPP-IV digestion (Fig. 1A). The identities of these two cleavage products were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown). Under the same reaction conditions, FAP did not cleave GPETLCGAEL (data not shown). We next investigated whether DPP-IV cleaves full-length IGF-1. IGF-1 has a molecular mass of 7650 daltons (Fig. 1B). After incubation with DPP-IV, the molecular mass of IGF-1 decreased to 7500 daltons, which corresponds to the deletion of the Gly\u2013Pro dipeptide at the amino terminus (Fig. 1C). The molecular mass of IGF-1 did not change when incubated with FAP (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that DPP-IV specifically cleaves the N-terminus of IGF-1, producing the Gly\u2013Pro dipeptide.",

Because the digestion of IGF-1 by DPP-IV is slow, a specific protocol was used to quantify the enzymatic reaction (30). The initial velocity was measured in the linear range of the reaction. After MASS identification and quantification (Materials and Methods), the kcat/Km value for the cleavage of IGF-1 by DPP-IV was 360 M\u20131s\u20131, with Km and kcat equal to 14 \u03bcM and 0.005 s\u20131, respectively. Based on these kinetic parameters, this cleavage is more efficient than the cleavage of CXCL11 by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) or CD23 by ADAM10, as reported previously (35, 36). At the micromolar level, the Km value is similar to those for the cleavage of GLP1 and GIP by DPP-IV (5, 7, 8). Therefore, the cleavage of IGF-1 by DPP-IV is physiologically relevant, despite its slow reaction, indicated by the kcat value.",

Three hours after stimulation, increased IGF-1R phosphorylation remained detectable (Fig. 4). However, for T-IGF1 at a similar concentration, the peak level of activation was not reached for 15 min and was followed by a large drop at 30 min (Fig. 4). No IGF-1R activation was observed after 3 h (Fig. 4). When IGF-1 or T-IGF1 was added at concentrations higher than physiological levels (0.5 and 1 nM), the levels of IGF-1R phosphorylation caused by both were indistinguishable during the subsequent 3 h. The results shown in Fig. 4 suggest that the activation of IGF-1R by T-IGF1 is delayed and not sustained.",

The prevailing model is that activated fibroblasts in tumors modify the phenotype of the epithelial cells via soluble and diffusible growth factors (37). These growth factors, including IGF-1, accelerate cell proliferation, modify the extracellular matrix, promote angiogenesis, and increase inflammatory cell recruitment (37). The proteolytic processing of IGF-1 by DPP-IV may represent a defense mechanism that mitigates IGF-1 activity in normal cells (Fig. 7A). Here, we provide evidence that IGF-1 activity is regulated by proteolytic processing by DPP-IV. The attenuation of IGF-1 signaling may be achieved by both a reduction in IGF-1R activation and increased IGF-1\u2013IGFBP3 binding (Figs 3\u20135). The Km of IGF-1 cleavage by DPP-IV is similar to the range reported for other physiological substrates of DPP-IV, including GLP1 and GIP (5\u20138). Consequently, IGF-1 could be a biological substrate of DPP-IV. Finally, DPP-IV is downregulated to almost undetectable levels in SCC, whereas there is no significant change in DPP-IV levels in ADC, suggesting that separate mechanisms underlie the development of these two cancer subtypes.",

On the contrary, reduced IGF-1 expression is linked to a reduction in cancer formation and metastasis (38, 39). In human population studies, higher IGF-1 levels in the circulation are associated with some cancer types, including colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers (40\u201342). Because the expression levels and regulation of IGF-1 affect cancer formation and progression (19), IGF-1 homeostasis in the microenvironment is crucial to the maintenance of the proper cellular proliferative and inhibitory activity.

Based on the cocrystal structure of IGF-1 with either the N-terminal or C-terminal domain of IGFBP, several residues of IGF-1 seem to be engaged in the interaction (46). Mutations at these residues, such as Glu3, significantly reduce the binding of IGF-1 to IGFBPs (48). Site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays have suggested that the binding of IGF-1 to IGF1R occurs between the C and D domains of IGF-1, which differs from the binding between IGF-1 and IGFBPs (46). Therefore, the weaker activation of IGF-1R by T-IGF1 is probably attributable to the conformational change caused by the lack of two amino acids at the amino terminus.",

Panel B: In malignant cells, the downregulation of DPP-IV might result in elevated levels of intact IGF-1 in the tumor niche, activating the IGF-1 axis. This might contribute to the acceleration of early carcinogenesis in certain cancer subtypes, such as SCC, as presented in this study.",
