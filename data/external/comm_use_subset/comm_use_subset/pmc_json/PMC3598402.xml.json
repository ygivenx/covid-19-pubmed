This is unfortunate, as underlying diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which are highly prevalent in the region, can worsen such illnesses [2]. The respiratory viruses known to cause acute illness include human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus and influenza viruses [3-5]. Until recently, the burden of influenza and influenza-like illness in Africa was considered to be negligible [6], mainly because of the lack of confirmation assays. Reports from Cameroon and Senegal, however, show that influenza viruses are actively circulating and may be causing regular epidemics [7,8].",

All specimens were also tested for other respiratory viruses in two previously described multiplex semi-nested RT-PCR assays for detecting influenza A and B viruses, HRSV, human metapneumovirus and PIV types 1, 2, 3 and 4 [10,11]. All assays were performed on an ABI 7500 platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) with the SuperScript III Platinum One-step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). A specimen was considered positive if the signal curve crossed the threshold line within 40 cycles. The assay limit of detection for pandemic H1N1pdm09 influenza virus is of order of magnitude of 10 copies/\u03bcL of initial sample [9]. The assay limit of detection for influenza A and B viruses, HRSV, human metapneumovirus and PIV-3 is of order of magnitude of 10 copies/\u03bcL [10]. For PIV-4, the assay limit of detection is of order of magnitude of 100 copies copies/\u03bcL, and for PIV-1 and \u22122, 1000 copies/\u03bcL [10]. After amplification, the PCR products were purified and sent to GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany) for sequencing.",

All four cases detected were indigenous, with no history of travel or contact with a person returning from a country with declared cases. Extensive investigations of contacts of the confirmed cases did not reveal any other cases, suggesting low dissemination of H1N1pdm09 in the country. The clinical picture of H1N1pdm09 infection was similar to that of seasonal influenza circulating before the pandemic. This is in accordance with studies showing relatively low transmissibility and severity of H1N1pdm09 [15,16]. Consequently, H1N1pdm09 did not appear to have had a significant public health impact in this area of the world.",

In the CAR, vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were introduced in the enlarged programme of vaccination only recently (H. influenzae in September 2008 and S. pneumoniae in July 2011). In a study in Bangui in 1995, these bacteria were found in hundreds of ill children aged less than 5 years [27]. It is therefore likely that these bacteria are still very common or even the main causes of respiratory infections in the CAR, as in other countries before the introduction of vaccines, when most severe respiratory infections were due to bacterial infections, and S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were the commonest bacterial causes [28-30]. This may explain, at least partly, the differences between our results and those of other studies. It is also possible that viruses other than these we looked for were involved, such as human rhinovirus, human bocavirus, human coronavirus or adenovirus.",

Another suggestion for future studies is to collect data about underlying health status of children as risk factors such as HIV infection, malaria, malnutrition, etc. might have an impact on the acute respiratory infections [33,34].
