Further, as a sample is typically analyzed whole, rather than as individual protein bands, proteins of interest are not masked by similarly migrating proteins on a gel, nor do they typically need to be present at sufficient levels to be visible after staining, leading to increased numbers of confidently identified proteins 4.",

However, the clustering of non-specifically binding proteins in a normal distribution allows proteins that specifically bind to a protein of interest to be distinguished as these have higher sample/mock ratios than the background. Whilst contaminants should theoretically cluster around a log2 SILAC ratio of 0, this is not necessarily the case, an example of this is given in Figure 3. Possible reasons for this include imperfect SILAC labeling of cells, loading unequal volumes or concentrations of lysate onto the anti-GFP beads, accidental loss of beads during purification or unequal mixing of samples at the end of the purification procedure3. However, assuming data are analyzed based on a threshold standard deviation from the mean of the normally distributed contaminants, minor shifts in the centering of the data should not affect the quality of the results.",

Lower ratios were observed for members of the eIF3 complex. However, this clearly illustrates that the experiment satisfactorily identified both direct and indirect binding partners of eIF4AI and II.

Where possible, western blots or functional assays should be performed to detect binding of a known protein interaction partner. Should a protein not tolerate fusion with a GFP tag, other tagging or pulldown strategies have been applied to SILAC pulldowns using both other tags (FLAG11, Biotin12, STREP (own data, unpublished)), or by using primary antibodies against a protein of interest where siRNA knockdown of the target protein provides a control sample13. Such experiments have been described elsewhere in the literature, but in brief, step 1 and steps 5.4-8 would be applied as above, with steps 2-5.3 modified as appropriate for the expression/pulldown system of choice using equal protein inputs as described in steps 2.4-2.5. As the quantification stages allow non-specific binding proteins to be removed at the analysis level, it is recommended to omit pre-incubation with control beads, or high salt washes in order to preserve low-affinity protein:protein interactions with a protein of interest. A nuclease may be included or omitted from this protocol according to the specifics of a particular experiment. For example: as the proteins used in this method are RNA helicases, RNase cocktail was included in the protocol to remove indirect interactions mediated via the RNA (step 3.2). In some cases however, there could be benefit from running parallel experiments with and without nuclease to identify nucleic acid dependent interactions.",

Whilst this approach is potentially more stringent, it does increase the complexity of the analysis, as in at least one replicate, a protein of interest will be produced in \u2018light\u2019 labeled cells and so it is necessary to distinguish between proteins consistently identified in \u2018light\u2019 samples (environmental contaminants such as keratins), and those that are only enriched in \u2018light\u2019 samples when bound to a protein of interest.",

The approach above is a simple and rapid approach to identifying protein:protein interactions that can be easily attempted by researchers with no previous experience with mass spectrometry, or analysis of large protein:protein interaction datasets. For most uses this is more than sufficient for identifying novel proteins of interest. Further modifications to this approach to help reduce this data loss are described elsewhere in the literature and include the use of a protein frequency library where known contaminant proteins for a specific set of experimental parameters (cell line, bead matrix, buffer conditions) may be excluded10,14. However, depending on the particular experimental parameters it may be necessary to run a number of control experiments to generate a bead proteome and this can therefore increase both the expense and complexity of the experiment.

The technique can be very easily adapted to a number of different purification strategies, allowing its application to any given protein of interest. Quantification of results vastly simplifies identification of genuine interactions, and permits relaxation of stringent buffer conditions used to remove non-specific binders, and thus preserves low affinity interactions. As up to three samples can be compared in the above strategy, the technique has clear strengths in comparing differences in protein binding between different protein isoforms, mutant proteins, or the effect of pharmacological inhibitors. As whole gel slices are analyzed rather than individual bands that stain by Coomassie, the numbers of proteins identified at high confidence are typically higher than those identified in a standard GST/TAP-pulldown, and experimenter bias in selecting proteins of interest is removed. The technique therefore compares very favorably with other commonly used techniques used in identification of novel protein-interactions (yeast 2-hybrid, GST/His or TAP Pulldowns).",
