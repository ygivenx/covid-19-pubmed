Since its emergence in late 2013, the epidemic has involved at least 28,599 cases and 11,299 deaths as of the end of 2015 [1]. No licensed vaccines were available before the epidemic and there is no established, specific treatment for EVD, which permitted its initial growth to be nearly exponential [2]. The disease posed a substantial risk of global spread during its early growth phase, and thus, the risk of observing substantial number of deaths. The majority of preventative measures to reduce EVD transmission have been limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions, including case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, as well as entry and exit screening at borders.",

These regulations also emphasize that any interference with international travel and trade must be minimized [3]. The WHO described the unfolding EVD epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern in August 2014. The declaration aimed to strengthen surveillance and monitoring of the virus on a global scale, including in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The WHO has never recommended travel restrictions to delay or prevent the international spread of EVD [4]. Nevertheless, unlike past epidemics of other infectious diseases, and perhaps because of the rapid geographic spread of EVD to cities with international airports, including Nigeria, a substantial number of countries at risk have adopted national policies to respond to the risk of EVD importation at borders. The restrictions ranged from partial cancellation of international flights to full closure of international borders, particularly in countries that belong to the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO). These large scale travel restrictions were implemented based on individual decisions of member countries.",

A data-assimilation study using epidemic modeling in metapopulation systems enabled researchers to offer real-time forecasting of the geographic spread of EVD [11]. A comparative study of entry and exit screening for EVD emphasized that the cost-effectiveness of entry screening among all incoming travelers at risk is likely to be limited, and argued that exit screening in affected countries would be more beneficial [12]. Another large-scale simulation study offered rapid feedback with respect to the delay effect of the EVD epidemic attributable to travel restrictions, estimating that travel restrictions led to a delay of EVD outbreaks for approximately 30 days in AFRO countries [13]. Moreover, a report issued by the World Bank quantified the economic impact of the 2013\u201316 EVD epidemic, indicating that there was negative economic growth in affected countries in 2015 [14].",

Because the major route of EVD transmission is via direct contact or through sexual intercourse [15,16], there may be additional predictors of EVD, other than travel to describe the increased risk of infection in particular individuals, such as social-cultural factors (e.g. a group of people sharing the same language or religion may lead to increased contact). In fact, the importance of accounting for socioeconomic predictors has been highlighted in epidemic modeling studies [17] and should be explicitly tested using empirical data. Employing a simplistic hazard-based regression approach, travel-associated risks and contact behaviors could be modelled in combination with measures of these cultural risk factors. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions, in all countries, that occurred from August to September 2014, using a simple statistical model and exploring additional explanatory variables of the risk of EVD importation.",

Major language was defined as the official language, and major religion was classified as having a coverage of 30% or greater, following analysis of literature in the data source [19].

Briefly, the effective distance is calculated as the minimum distance between a pair of countries, accounting for the length of path and degree (i.e. number of edges), by employing an adjacent matrix. As the shortest path dominantly predicts the most likely global spread of infectious diseases, the effective distance appeared to be an excellent predictor of arrival time (i.e. the time from emergence to importation of a novel infectious disease) [24]. The validity of predictive performance of the effective distance has been theoretically and empirically argued by Brockmann and Helbing [24] with reference to the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (H1N1-2009). Moreover, the effective distance has been repeatedly used for other application areas including the real time forecasting of the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Zika virus [25,26]. Among a total of 227 countries, three affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) were grouped into one geographic unit, and subsequently the effective distance from this amalgamated unit to the rest of the 224 countries was calculated.",

The effectiveness of travel restrictions tended to be greatest among AFRO countries, which instituted travel restrictions earliest between August and September 2014. The European countries had the lowest estimated effectiveness, but this is expected because of high connectivity with African countries by air transportation, the acceptance of medical evacuation for international aid workers and their historical context.

As implicated in a large-scale simulation study of travel restrictions [13], an epidemic cannot be prevented with travel restrictions.

Preventative measures at borders may be effective in conjunction with concerted control efforts, including improvement in awareness of the epidemic\u2019s current situation among the public. Rather than expecting border control to be effective, it is better to give priority to locally controlling the spread of disease upon emergence [32,33]. Although the international spread of EVD was limited from 2013\u201316, our results imply that limited global spread is attributable to successful local control, mainly in the three affected countries, since the effective reproductive number for all three affected countries had fallen to value close to 1 by late September 2014.

In the case of EVD, the total number of imported countries was very small, and rather than strictly selecting variables with practical (or causal) explanations, it is possible that a few variables that simply statistically improved the goodness-of-fit might have been selected. For this reason, we have also estimated the effectiveness using only the effective distance, throughout the present study. The predictive performance is expected to be improved by selecting truly insightful variables and specific countries particularly at-risk of importation, therefore the present study has shown the potential approaches to exploring epidemiological predictors of importation risk in addition to airline transportation network data.",

This approach could have underestimated the risk of importation in West African countries, especially in countries that share borders with Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Second, our network data were imperfect. The dataset was built on direct connecting flights and the degree was determined by the number of flight routes (i.e. not based on the number of passengers). Rather than overcoming these limitations in the network data, greater weight was given to the use of simple open source data [26,35]; however, we believe that using flight route data in our approach was well justified in the context of regression-based modeling using the effective distance. Third, previous studies based on airline transportation network data have used the incorrect assumption that the infected, exporting individual is randomly selected from a source country [36]. Although this assumption was not overcome in the present study, it should be noted that our approach will be able to partially address that assumption by adding key predictive data, such as socioeconomic strata.",

The relative risk reduction resulting from travel restrictions was estimated to be approximately 20%; this was not considered a substantial risk reduction to prevent the global epidemic of EVD. Our study highlights the need to strengthen local capacities for disease monitoring and control, rather than relying heavily on border control [37,38]. In addition to local capacity-building and preparedness, we also suggest that rapid local containment should be achieved through coordinated and expedited international cooperation, especially in capacity-limited settings, as was the case with the EVD epidemic [39\u201341].",
