On initial isolation of SARS-CoV from infected patients, it was identified as a novel Group 2 Coronavirus and the genetic mechanisms governing the increased pathogenicity of the virus remain undefined [1],[2]. In severe cases, SARS-CoV infection rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the acute phase of infection or to an organizing phase diffuse alveolar damage following virus clearance; two clinically devastating end stage lung diseases. The molecular mechanisms governing these severe end stage lung disease outcomes are unknown, although similar pathologies have been reported following H5N1 and 1918 influenza virus infection.",

During virus infection the type I interferon (IFN) induction and signaling machinery is key to the initiation of this response. IFN induced from either infected cells or dendritic cells can activate an antiviral state in neighboring cells to signal that a viral infection is under way[5]. Not surprisingly, virus infections (mouse hepatitis virus, influenza virus, RSV, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, etc.) of rodents that lack type I or type II IFN regulatory networks result in increased pathogenesis and mortality, documenting the key role IFNs play in regulating disease outcomes[6]\u2013[12].",

            "text": "Given the importance of the IFN system in regulating virus growth, many highly pathogenic viruses encode proteins that antagonize components of the innate immune system. The Ebola virus encodes VP35 which blocks STAT1 signaling[13],[14], influenza NS1 blocks IRF3 activation[15],[16] and V proteins from the Nipah and Hendra viruses induce STAT1 degradation[17]. Several IFN antagonist genes are encoded in the SARS-CoV genome and target IFN sensing and signaling and NFKB induction[18]\u2013[21]. However, the role of IFN in regulating SARS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo is less clear. From microarray studies using RNA from PBMC's for 50 SARS patients, Cameron et. al. observed a robust type I IFN response early in the disease and predicted that it was essential for viral clearance and clinical recovery[22]. In addition to a strong IFN response, genes such as CCL2 (MCP-1) and CXCL10 (IP-10) that are typically induced by IFN were also up-regulated in patients at early times in SARS-CoV disease. Interestingly, Cameron and colleagues suggested that the IFN response that served to protect recovered SARS patients could become a dysregulated cytokine storm in severe cases and contribute to increased disease and a suboptimal adaptive immune response. The innate immune response to SARS-CoV also changes with age of the host; 12 month old BALB/c mice respond to SARS-CoV with an exacerbated and faster innate immune induction than 6 to 8 week old mice, potentially explaining their increased susceptibility and lung pathology following infection[23],[24].",

Glass et al demonstrated that SARS-CoV was cleared from the lungs of wildtype C57BL/6 mice and strains that lacked that T, B and NK cells with similar kinetics, suggesting that the innate immune response alone is sufficient for viral clearance [28].

Specifically, we tested the role of type I, type II, and type III IFN and STAT1 in protection from SARS-CoV infection. We have found that absence of the IFN \u03b1/\u03b2, IFN\u03b3 and IFN\u03bb, receptors alone or in some instances together, had a limited impact on pathogenicity and clearance of the non-lethal and lethal strains of SARS-CoV in mice. However, STAT1 deficient mice show increased susceptibility, prolonged virus shedding and mortality following infection with either virus. Importantly, STAT1\u2212/\u2212 animals developed an organizing phase DAD, similar to lesions noted in severe late stage human cases of SARS. Our data reveals a new mechanistic pathway by which STAT1 regulates the severity of viral pathogenesis in the lung. We show that SARS-CoV pathogenesis is STAT1 dependent but independent of type I, II and III IFN signaling, and we provide evidence consistent with an essential role for STAT1 in the control of SARS-CoV replication, cell proliferation, wound repair and progression to severe organizing phase DAD and lethal disease.",

In both cases, virus titers in the lungs peaked at day 2 post-infection, approaching titers of \u223c5.0\u00d7107 pfu or TCID50/g (rMA15 or Urbani, respectively), and all were rapidly cleared by day 9 post-infection. Although virus titers were \u223c5-fold higher in IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 mice than titers in 129 WT mice on day 5 post-infection, we found that IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 and IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 mice showed no increase in susceptibility, pathogenesis or histological outcomes to rMA15 or Urbani virus infection. To examine the importance of cooperative IFN pathways in disease, IFN receptor double knockout (IFNAGR\u2212/\u2212) mice were infected with the Urbani virus; no increase in virus titer or weight loss was seen compared to 129 WT mice or the single IFN receptor knockout mice (Figure S1). These data suggest that neither type I nor type II IFN receptors are critical for the regulation of SARS-CoV infection and pathogenic outcomes in mice.",

Plugs of cellular debris and fibrin filled some bronchioles. A blue tinge was noted in the perivascular edema fluid, suggesting early collagen deposition. Viral antigen was much less common in the epithelium but was abundant in the cellular debris in the airways. At day 9, inflammatory cells increased around residual inflammatory lesions, with abundant neutrophils and more macrophages in the lesions. Marked epithelial hyperplasia was also seen in these foci. Bronchiolitis obliterans was seen in a few airways and interstitial lesions developed around some airway lesions, one of which extended to the pleura and producing focal pleuritis. Much of the lung parenchyma was, however, histologically normal. Only a few cells or cell debris was seen expressing viral antigen.

These lesions were characterized by a central area of necrosis with numerous neutrophils and an outer zone of macrophages. Viral antigen was found in some of the macrophages in these pyogranulomatous lesions (Figure S2D, E). Plasma cells became abundant in the splenic lesions by day 24 (Figure S2G).

By day 9, there was no viral RNA signal found in the lungs of 129 WT, IFNAR1\u2212/\u2212 and IFNGR\u2212/\u2212 mice, corresponding to the lack of viral replication at this time point. In contrast, lungs of STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed significant viral RNA signal throughout the lungs, including prominent distribution into the periphery of the lung at early and late times post-infection. Surprisingly, but consistent with the findings on histopathology, viral RNA signal was lost from the airway epithelial cells in the bronchioles by day 9 in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice and was found throughout the periphery of the lungs, prominently focused in large focal compactions of cells. These foci correspond to the prominent focal lesions noted in H&E stained sections of the lung, which are predominantly composed of fibroblasts, macrophages and lymphocytes (Figure 3B).

The receptor for IFNL is a heterodimer of IL10Rb and IL28Ra. IL28Ra\u2212/\u2212 mice have been generated on the BALB/c mouse background but not on the 129 WT mouse background. Thus, although direct comparison with the other mouse strains is not possible, experiments with SARS-CoV in these mice are still informative. As in the C57B6 background, the Urbani virus does not cause disease or weight loss but the virus replicates in the lungs of BALB/c mice. Virus reaches peak titer by day 2 post-infection and infection is resolved by day 7[36]. In contrast, rMA15 virus infection of BALB/c mice causes death by day 4 or 5 post-infection[30]. We hypothesized that if IFNL was important for protection from SARS-CoV infection, the virus would be more virulent in mice lacking the IFNL receptor and IFNL receptor knockout mice would show evidence of disease while normal BALB/c mice would not. Further, rMA15 virus infection of IL28Ra\u2212/\u2212 mice may result in enhanced pathology with more weight loss, higher virus titer, or increased lung pathology.",

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that aged mice infected with recombinant viruses encoding S glycoproteins from early phase or zoonotic SARS-CoV strains developed ARDS, characterized by hyaline membranes and DAD.

The Type I, II and III IFNs are typically produced by different cell populations and use distinct membrane bound receptors to gain entry into cells; Type I uses IFNAR1, Type II uses IFNGR and Type III uses IL28Ra/IL10Rb. However, all three share a common cytoplasmic signaling protein, called STAT1, that is translocated to the nucleus and induces expression of multiple, overlapping IFN regulated genes (ISGs)[38]. Deletion of any or all of the signaling components involved in the STAT1 signaling pathway diminishes the innate immune response to pathogens and increases susceptibility to several bacterial and viral agents. Mice lacking IFN receptors show increased susceptibility to West Nile[9], influenza[12],[39], Ebola[11], Friend virus[40], RSV[7],[8] and Poliovirus[41] (reviewed in [42]). Moreover, the same phenotypes are noted in STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, demonstrating a key role of the entire innate immune pathway in regulating disease severity, viral titers, and pathology[10]. In stark contrast, we demonstrate the paradoxical finding that SARS-CoV Urbani and rMA15 viruses induce severe end stage lung disease by a STAT1 dependent mechanism that is independent of IFN receptor type I, II and III signaling. The data point to a novel mechanism by which STAT1 function regulates disease severity in the lung following SARS-CoV induced acute lung injury.",

These results suggest a novel mechanism of STAT1 regulation of severe end stage lung disease following SARS-CoV infection that is independent of it's roles in IFN signaling and ISG expression. Although it is possible that cooperative combinations of several IFNs (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN\u03b3, IFN\u03bb) that signal through STAT1 are required to regulate SARS-CoV infection, we feel that the possibility exists that STAT1's role in controlling cell proliferation and wound healing may be the base cause of the increased disease seen in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice.

STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts showed increased proliferation when exposed to growth factors compared to WT mouse fibroblasts. Additionally, STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice demonstrated a greater susceptibility to chemically induced pulmonary fibrosis via bleomycin treatment. These data suggested that outside of the innate immune response, STAT1 may function as a key regulator of cell proliferation and of the wound healing response[49].

SARS-CoV ORF6 blocks STAT1 nuclear import[18], PLP blocks IRF3 activation[51], NSP7[51], NSP15[51], ORF3b and N have been shown to be IFN antagonists as well[19]. Importantly, these antagonists only function in the context of SARS-CoV infection within discrete permissive cells. This suggests that in infected cells, the multiple pathways that inhibit IFN signaling may create essentially a STAT\u2212/\u2212 environment which may contribute to the further pathology seen during disease. As has been described with influenza, it is likely that a cytokine storm significantly contributes to increased pathogenic outcomes by targeting non-infected cells. The loss of STAT1 in other cells of the knockout mouse may contribute as we have described here, to loss of wound healing control and induction of fibrosis, leading to the development of the lethal disease state after SARS-CoV infection.",

Sheahan et. al. identified a role for Myd88, an adapter protein of TLR signaling, and RAG1, necessary for antibody production, in protection from infection and disease. Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed an enhanced susceptibility to rMA15 virus infection in C57/B6 mice[26] and RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed no increased morbidity and mortality from rMA15 virus infection, viral replication in the lungs was detectable through 28 days post-infection[26]. These data suggest that an intricate balance between the innate and adaptive immune response is necessary for protection from SARS-CoV infection. We are currently working on understanding how these two processes interact in the host. Using proteomic and microarray analyses Cameron et al\n[22] showed that individuals who survived SARS-CoV infection had controlled innate immune, ISG and cytokine responses while individuals who progressed to severe disease demonstrated an uncontrolled innate immune response, with high levels of ISG and immunoglobulin expression, increased cytokine responses and poor antibody responses to the spike protein. The cause of this lack of regulation is not understood.",

However, SARS-CoV Urbani spreads from the respiratory tract into the spleen and liver of STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice. This suggests that although the damage may have been induced by viral infection, the pathology results from the host's response to the infection, though it is not clear whether this represents a normal pattern of spread or whether mutations have evolved in the virus that promote spread and distribution to other organs. Similar findings were seen in autopsy samples from individuals who died from SARS. Airways were intact and regenerated while acute cases showed spread to the outer pulmonary parenchyma[52].",

As observed in our study, IFN\u03b3 expression increases substantially in STAT1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We hypothesize that this may be in response to a lack of negative feedback via the STAT1 signaling pathway.
